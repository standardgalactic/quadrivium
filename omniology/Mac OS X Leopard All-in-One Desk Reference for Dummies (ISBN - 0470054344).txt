About the Author
Mark L. Chambers has been an author, computer consultant, BBS sysop, 
programmer, and hardware technician for more than 20 years — pushing
computers and their uses far beyond “normal” performance limits for
decades now. His first love affair with a computer peripheral blossomed in
1984 when he bought his lightning-fast 300 BPS modem for his Atari 400. Now
he spends entirely too much time on the Internet and drinks far too much 
caffeine-laden soda.
With a degree in journalism and creative writing from Louisiana State
University, Mark took the logical career choice: programming computers.
However, after five years as a COBOL programmer for a hospital system, he
decided there must be a better way to earn a living, and he became the
Documentation Manager for Datastorm Technologies, a well-known communi-
cations software developer. Somewhere in between writing software manuals,
Mark began writing computer how-to books. His first book, Running a 
Perfect BBS, was published in 1994 — and after a short decade or so of fun
(disguised as hard work), Mark is one of the most productive and best-
selling technology authors on the planet.
Along with writing several books a year and editing whatever his publishers
throw at him, Mark has also branched out into Web-based education, design-
ing and teaching a number of online classes — called WebClinics — for
Hewlett-Packard.
His favorite pastimes include collecting gargoyles, watching St. Louis
Cardinals baseball, playing his three pinball machines and the latest com-
puter games, supercharging computers, and rendering 3D flights of fancy
with TrueSpace — and during all that, he listens to just about every type of
music imaginable. Mark’s worldwide Internet radio station, MLC Radio 
(at www.mlcbooks.com), plays only CD-quality classics from 1970 to 1979,
including everything from Rush to Billy Joel to the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
Mark’s rapidly expanding list of books includes MacBook For Dummies; 
iMac For Dummies, 4th Edition; Mac OS X Tiger All-in-One Desk Reference 
For Dummies; Building a PC For Dummies, 5th Edition; Scanners For Dummies, 
2nd Edition; CD & DVD Recording For Dummies, 2nd Edition; PCs All-in-One
Desk Reference For Dummies, 2nd Edition; Mac OS X Tiger: Top 100 Simplified
Tips & Tricks; Microsoft Office v. X Power User’s Guide; BURN IT! Creating Your
Own Great DVDs and CDs; The Hewlett-Packard Official Printer Handbook; The
Hewlett-Packard Official Recordable CD Handbook; The Hewlett-Packard
Official Digital Photography Handbook; Computer Gamer’s Bible; Recordable 
CD Bible; Teach Yourself the iMac Visually; Running a Perfect BBS; Official
Netscape Guide to Web Animation; and Windows 98 Troubleshooting and
Optimizing Little Black Book.

His books have been translated into 15 different languages so far — his
favorites are German, Polish, Dutch, and French. Although he can’t read
them, he enjoys the pictures a great deal.
Mark welcomes all comments about his books. You can reach him at
mark@mlcbooks.com, or visit MLC Books Online, his Web site, at

Dedication
This book is dedicated with love to Frank and Vera Judycki. They might have
started out as my in-laws, but now they’re MawMaw and PawPaw.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Once again, the good folks at Wiley Publishing have made things easy on a
demanding technology author! It’s time to send my appreciation to those who
helped make this book a reality.
As with all my books, I’d like to first thank my wife, Anne; and my children,
Erin, Chelsea, and Rose; for their support and love — and for letting me
follow my dream!
No project gets underway without the Composition Services team. Starting
with my words and adding a tremendous amount of work, Composition
Services has once again taken care of art, layout, and countless other steps
that I can’t fathom. Thanks to each of the team members for a beautiful book.
Next, my appreciation goes to editorial manager Kevin Kirschner as well as to
my technical editor Dennis Cohen, who checked the technical accuracy of
every word — including that baker’s dozen of absurd acronyms that crops up
in every technology book I’ve ever written. Their work ensures that my work
is the best it can be!
Finally, I come to my hardworking project editor, Pat O’Brien, and my top-of-
the-line acquisitions editor Bob Woerner: My heartfelt thanks to both of
them, for without their support at every step, this book wouldn’t have been
possible. With their help, yet another For Dummies title was guided safely
into port!

Introduction
E
legant.
I remember the first moment that I moved a mouse across a Mac OS X
Desktop — at that time, it was the beta of version 10.0 — and I very well
remember the word elegant as my first impression. (My second impression
was UNIX done better.)
That’s really saying something because I’m an old operating system cur-
mudgeon: I cut my computing teeth on Atari, Commodore 64, and TRS-80
Model III machines, and I still feel much at home in the character-based
environment of DOS and UNIX. Of course, I’ve also used every version of
Windows that His Gateness has produced, including the much-improved
Windows XP. And yes, I’ve used Mac OS since before the days of System 7,
using a Macintosh SE with a 9-inch monitor (and a built-in handle).
But out of this host of operating systems, could you really call one elegant
before now? (Even Mac OS 9 didn’t deserve such a description although it
did provide the foundation of convenience and simplicity.) Mac OS X — now
at version 10.5, affectionately called Leopard — is something different: It’s a
fine-cut diamond amongst a handful of semi-precious stones. It’s the result
of an unnatural marriage, I’ll admit . . . the intuitive, graphical world of Mac
OS 9 paired with the character-based stability and efficient multitasking of
UNIX. Who would have thought that they would work together so well? Mac
OS X performs like a Ferrari, and (unbelievably) it looks as good, too.
Therefore, you can imagine just how excited I was to be asked by my friends
at Wiley to write this book and how I immediately jumped at the chance to
write a comprehensive guide to Apple’s masterpiece. The book that you
hold in your hands is a classic For Dummies design — it provides you the
step-by-step instruction (plenty of which my editors agree is humorous) on
every major feature of Mac OS X — but it also goes a step further from time
to time, delving into why something works the way that it does or what’s
going on behind the scenes. You can chalk that up to my sincere admiration
for everyone in Cupertino and what they’ve perfected.
What you won’t find in this Desk Reference is wasted space. All the new 
features of version 10.5 are here, including the latest iChat AV, Dashboard,
Spotlight, Spaces, the new Time Machine application, the latest versions of
all the iApps (including iWeb), and the new incarnation of Apple Mail.
Everything’s explained from the ground up, just in case you’ve never
touched an Apple computer before. By the time you reach the final pages,

What’s Really Required
2
you’ll have covered advanced topics, such as networking, AppleScript,
Internet security . . . and yes, even an introduction to the powerful world of
UNIX that exists underneath.
I sincerely hope that you’ll enjoy this book and that it will act as your guide
while you discover all the wonderful features of Mac OS X Leopard that I use
every day. Remember, if a Windows-enslaved acquaintance still titters about
your iMac, I’ll understand if you’re tempted to drop this weighty tome on his
foot. (Of course, if you’re using an Intel-based Mac, you can also boot into
Windows XP and watch him turn purple.)
The official name of the latest version is (portentous pause here, please) Mac
OS X version 10.5 Leopard. But who wants to spit out that mouthful every
time? Throughout this book, I refer to the operating system as Mac OS X, and
when I discuss something that’s particular to the latest version, I call it
Leopard.
What’s Really Required
If you’ve got a Mac that’s either running Mac OS X version 10.5 (Leopard) or
is ready to be upgraded to it, you’re set to go. Despite what you might have
heard, you won’t require any of the following:
✦A degree in computer science: Apple designed Mac OS X for regular
people, and I designed this book for people of every experience level.
Even if you’ve never used a Mac before, you’ll find no hostile waters
here.
✦A fortune in software: I do describe additional software that you can
buy to expand the functionality of your Mac; however, that section is
only a few pages long. Everything else covered in this book is included
with Mac OS X Leopard — and by the size of this volume, you get a
rough idea of just how complete Mac OS X is! Heck, many folks buy Macs
just because of the free software you get, like iMovie and iPhoto. (Tough
cookies to the vast Unwashed Windows Horde.)
✦An Internet connection: Granted, you’re not going to do much with
Apple Mail without an Internet connection, but computers did exist
before the Internet. You can still be productive with Mac OS X without
receiving buckets of spam.
Oh, you will need a set of Mac OS X version 10.5 installation discs, unless
Leopard came pre-installed on your Mac. Go figure.

Conventions Used in This Book

About This Book
Although this book is a Desk Reference, you can also read it in a linear fashion
(straight through) — probably not in one session, mind you. (Then again, Diet
Coke is cheap, so it is possible.) The material is divided into seven mini-books,
each of which covers an entire area of Mac OS X knowledge. For example,
you’ll find mini-books on networking, the Apple Digital Hub suite of applica-
tions, customizing your Desktop, and Internet-related applications.
Each self-contained chapter discusses a specific feature, application, connec-
tion, or cool thing about Mac OS X. Feel free to begin reading anywhere or
skip chapters at will. For example, if you’re already using an Internet connec-
tion, you won’t need the chapter on adding an Internet connection. However,
I recommend that you read this book from the front to the back, like any
good mystery novel. (Watch out, oncoming spoiler: For those that want to
know right now, Bill Gates did it.)
Conventions Used in This Book
Even For Dummies books have to get technical from time to time, usually
involving commands that you have to type and menu items that you have to
click. If you’ve read any of my other For Dummies books, you’ll know that a
helpful set of conventions is used to indicate what needs to be done or what
you see onscreen.
Stuff you type
When I ask you to type a command or enter something in a text field (like
your name or phone number), the text appears like this: Type me.
Press the Return key to process the command or enter the text.
Menu commands
When I give you a specific set of menu commands to use, they appear in the
following format: Edit➪Copy.
In this example, you should click the Edit menu and then choose the Copy
menu item.
Display messages
If I mention a specific message that you see on your screen, it looks like this
on the page: This is a message displayed by an application.

How This Book Is Organized
4
In case you’re curious about computers
No one expects a book in the For Dummies series to contain techno-jargon 
or ridiculous computer science semantics — especially a book about the
Macintosh, which has always strived for simplicity and user-friendliness. I
hereby promise that I’ll do my absolute best to avoid unnecessary techno-talk.
For those who are interested in what’s happening under the hood, I provide
sidebars that explain a little more about what’s doing what to whom. If you’d
rather just have fun and ignore the digital dirty work, please feel free to disre-
gard these additions (but don’t tear sidebars out of the book because there’s
likely to be important stuff on the opposite side of the page).
How This Book Is Organized
I’ve done my best to emulate the elegant design of Mac OS X by organizing
this book into seven mini-books, with cross-references where appropriate.

This mini-book begins with an invigorating chapter explaining exactly why
you should be so happy to be a Mac OS X owner. Then I provide an introduc-
tion to the basic tasks that you’ll perform — things like copying files, run-
ning programs, and the like. You’ll also find coverage of Leopard’s newly
enhanced Spotlight search engine, a guide to normal Mac OS X maintenance
and troubleshooting, and instructions on using the Mac OS X Help system.
Book II: Customizing and Sharing
Who wants to stick with the defaults? The material in this mini-book leads
you through the steps that you need to customize Mac OS X to your specific
needs and desires . . . everything from a tweak to your background or screen
saver to a description of how to set up and administer multiple accounts on
a single Macintosh. You’ll also find coverage of the different settings that you
can change in System Preferences, which is an important place in Mac OS X.
Book III: The Digital Hub
Sweet! This mini-book jumps right in among the crown jewels of the Digital
Hub: iTunes, iPhoto, iDVD, iMovie, iWeb, GarageBand, QuickTime, and the
DVD Player. Taken as a suite, these applications allow you to plug in and use
all sorts of electronic gadgets, including digital cameras, digital video (DV)
camcorders, and MP3 players — plus, you can edit or create your own DVDs,
audio CDs, and movies.

Book IV: The Typical Internet Stuff
This mini-book contains just what it says. But then again, it’s easy to get
enthusiastic about Apple Mail, the latest version of Apple’s instant messag-
ing application (iChat AV), and the online storage provided by iDisk. I also
cover Safari, Apple’s hot-rod Web browser. Finally, you’ll discover more
about the built-in Internet firewall and how you can use it to safeguard your
Mac from Internet undesirables.
Book V: Networking in Mac OS X
Ethernet, Bluetooth, Bonjour, and AppleTalk are lurking in this mini-book. I
explain them step-by-step, in language that a normal human being can under-
stand. Find out how to use wireless networks like AirPort Extreme from Apple
as well as how to share an Internet connection with other computers in a local
network.
Book VI: Expanding Your System
Time to take things up a notch. In this mini-book, I discuss the hardware 
and software that everyone’s adding to Mac OS X and why you might (or
might not) need such toys. Memory (RAM), hard drives, printers, USB, and
FireWire 800 . . . they’re all discussed here in detail. Consider this a banquet
of expansion information.
Book VII: Advanced Mac OS X
I know that I told you earlier that I was going to avoid techno-talk whenever
possible, yet I also mentioned the advanced things that you’ll find in this
mini-book, like using UNIX within Mac OS X and using Automator to build
your own custom script applications that handle repetitious tasks. If you
don’t mind immersing yourself in all that’s technical, read here for the
skinny on hosting a Web site and communicating with Mac OS X by using
your voice and your handwriting.
Icons Used in This Book
The icons in this book are more than just attractive — they’re also important
visual cues for stuff that you don’t want to miss.
Okay, so Mark’s Maxims aren’t marked with an icon, per se. However, they
represent way-important stuff, so I call your attention to these nuggets in
bold, like this:

Icons Used in This Book

Something Really Important Is Being Said that will likely affect your
person in the near future. Pay attention, commit those Maxims to
memory, and you’ll avoid the pitfalls that the rest of us have hit on the
way.™
The Tip icons flag short snippets of information that will save you time or
trouble (and, in some cases, even cash).
These icons highlight optional technical information for folks like me. If you
also used to disassemble alarm clocks for fun when you were six years old,
you’ll love this stuff.
Always read this information next to this icon first! Something looms ahead
that could put your hardware or software at risk.
Look to the Remember icons for those tidbits that you need to file away in
your mind. Just remember to remember.
Follow these road signs for all the cool updates and innovations in Mac OS X
version 10.5 Leopard.

t’s human nature to require instant gratification from your software. I’ve
seen it countless times: Someone runs a program, immediately feels com-
fortable with it, and then spends the rest of his days using that program reli-
giously. Or another person plays with the same program for 120 seconds
and dismisses it as too difficult or too confusing. It’s rather like watching a
fancy fashion show runway in Rome or Paris: There had better be eye
appeal pretty quickly, or the bucks won’t flow.
Ditto for modern computer operating systems. An operating system is the
basic software that determines the look and feel of your entire computer
and usually extends to the programs that you run as well. Microsoft felt the
pinch of an old-fashioned operating system when Windows 98 and Windows
Me were starting to appear rather plain-looking. Then came Windows XP,
where menus fade in and out like fireflies on a summer night, little puppies
help you find files, and animation abounds. With the arrival of Windows
Vista, Microsoft has attempted to match some of the elegance and power of
Mac OS X in the PC world . . . but to be honest, updating a PC by upgrading
to Windows Vista is a little like putting on a polyester sports coat over the
same tired old leisure suit — most of what changes is on the outside.
Apple doesn’t work that way. Sure, Mac OS X looks doggone good. Forget
the minimum requirement of shirt and shoes because this operating system
is wearing an Armani suit. What’s really exciting for Macintosh owners
around the world, however, is the heart that beats beneath the pretty form.
Mac OS X is quite literally an operating system revolution, delivering some
of the most advanced features available on any personal computer in use
today while remaining as easy to use as the first Macintosh. (And yes, I do
own, use, and enjoy both PCs and Macs — what’s important to me is which
computer does the best job the fastest in the easiest manner.)

Convince Me: Why Mac OS X?

Now, I’m not going to just haul off and proclaim that Mac OS X can run rings
around — well . . . you know, the W word — without solid proof. In this chap-
ter, I introduce you to the advantages of Mac OS X and why it’s such a step
ahead for those running Windows. I also cover the hardware requirements
that you’ll need to run Mac OS X version 10.5 (Leopard) as well as guidelines
on switching from Windows. Finally, I familiarize you with the steps that
you’ll encounter the first time that you fire up the Big X.
Convince Me: Why Mac OS X?
Apple pioneered the graphical approach to computing with the appearance
of the first Macintosh, so you’d expect Mac OS X to be simple to use — and
indeed it is. For many folks, that’s Job One. If you’re one of those people, you
can happily skip this section without need of further evidence because Mac
OS X is undoubtedly the easiest operating system on the planet to use. (And
believe me, I’m not knocking simplicity. Computers are supposed to be get-
ting easier to use, and techno-nerds like me are supposed to be rendered
unnecessary as computers advance.) Here is the mantra of the Mac — and
the first of Mark’s Maxims for this volume:
Make it easy.
Still with me? Need more testimony? Or perhaps you’re just curious about
the engine under the hood. Then read on — and if you’re a Macintosh owner,
feel free to gloat! (If you’re a PC owner, there’s always eBay.)
Pretty to behold
Let me illustrate with a screenshot or two: Figure 1-1 illustrates a typical
screen from a day spent in Mac OS v. 9.2, the capable — albeit rather old-
fashioned — version of the Mac OS operating system that shipped in the
days before Mac OS X.
Compare that screen with a similar screen from the latest version of the Big X,
as shown in Figure 1-2. As you can see, everything’s streamlined in appear-
ance, with maximum efficiency in mind. Tasteful 3-D abounds, from the drop-
shadowed windows to the liquid-look scroll bars. Icons look like miniature
works of art. Macintosh owners appreciate outstanding design — and can 
recognize the value of a great computer, even if it’s lime-green (or looks like
half of a white basketball). After all, many Mac owners are professionals in the
graphic arts, and Apple provides the hardware that they need — like the top-
of-the-line, liquid crystal display (LCD) used with the 24-inch flat-panel Intel
iMac or the killer performance of the latest Mac Pro with dual dual-core (or
even quad-core) processors.
Take a look at what’s going on behind the curtain — the Great Oz is actually
pretty busy back there.

The allure of Aqua
The Apple software developers who introduced us to Mac OS X designed
this new look from the ground up. They call it Aqua, and it’s Leopard’s stan-
dard user interface.
Whoops, I just realized that I slipped a ten-cent example of techno-babble
into that previous paragraph. Let me explain: A user interface design deter-
mines how things look throughout both the operating system itself and all
applications that are written to run under an operating system (OS). This
includes the buttons that you push, the controls that you click or move, and
even the appearance of the windows and menus themselves. For example, if
you’ve already begun to use Mac OS X, you’ve probably stopped right in the
middle of a task and exclaimed to yourself, “Why, Self, look at that cool 3-D
contour effect on that menu bar!” That shapely contour is a tiny part of the
Aqua user interface design.
Aqua also extends to the placement of controls and how they’re shown to
you. For example:
✦Mac OS X uses Aqua sheets (which are attached to their parent dialogs
and windows) to prompt you for input, like confirming when you’re
about to close a document without saving it. Unlike Windows, multiple
programs can have multiple sheets open, so you can continue to work in
other applications without being rudely forced to answer the query
immediately.
✦Aqua’s file selection controls, like the one in Figure 1-3, make it much easier
to navigate quickly to a specific file or folder from within an application.
Figure 1-3:

Aqua).

✦The Dock is another Aqua addition, replacing some of the functions of
the old Control Strip and the Launcher from Mac OS 9. The Dock
launches your favorite applications, indicates what’s running on your
Mac, and allows you to switch between those programs — and all in a
strip that you can relocate and customize at will. I talk about the Dock in
greater detail in Book II, Chapter 2.
Consider Aqua as the look-and-feel of Mac OS X and virtually all applications
that it runs; you’ll discover how to use these Aqua controls in the pages to
come. Of course, Mac owners really don’t have to worry about Aqua itself;
the Aqua guidelines are a roadmap for those writing applications for Mac OS X.
Programs written to the common Aqua interface standard will be easier for
you to use, and you’ll become a proficient power user of that program much
faster.
The quality of Quartz
The second ingredient in the visual feast that is Mac OS X is Quartz Extreme —
again, I must ask your forgiveness, good reader, because I have to get a tad
technical again. Quartz Extreme is a graphics engine: It’s the portion of Mac
OS X that draws what you see on the screen (in the Aqua interface, natch).
Think of the engine in your car, which is responsible for making your car
move. Whether your Mac is running Microsoft Word or simply idling at the
Desktop waiting for you to finish your soda, Quartz Extreme is at work dis-
playing icons, drawing shapes, exhibiting the Finder, and animating things in
the Dock.
What sets Quartz Extreme apart from the ho-hum graphics engine that
Windows uses? It’s all about international programming standards . . . you
know, those things that Microsoft would much rather that you forget. To wit:
✦PDF: The Quartz Extreme engine is built around the Acrobat Portable
Document Format (PDF for short) developed by Adobe. If you’ve been
spending any time at all on the Internet in the last five or so years, you
know that PDF files have emerged as the standard for displaying and
printing the highest-quality electronic documents. Plus, Adobe has
released a version of the free Acrobat Reader (www.adobe.com) for just
about every computer on this green Earth. This means that text and
graphics displayed in Quartz Extreme are razor sharp, resizable, and
easily portable from one computer to another. In fact, Mac OS X displays
PDF files without even requiring Acrobat, using the built-in Preview
application. Figure 1-4 shows a complex PDF document that I opened in
Mac OS X.

Convince Me: Why Mac OS X?
14
✦OpenGL: Gamers will get really excited about this one: Quartz Extreme
also uses the OpenGL graphics acceleration standard, which delivers the
fastest 3-D graphics on the planet. (Think photo-realistic, high-resolution
graphics drawn in the blink of an eye.) In fact — and this is a really 
cool trick — if you have an advanced 3-D card, OpenGL is even used to
produce the Desktop in Mac OS X Leopard.
In English, that means that today’s top-of-the-line, 3-D gaming and 3-D
graphics acceleration can take care of drawing everything; forget about
waiting for windows to close or menus to appear, even when you’re cre-
ating the world’s biggest honking spreadsheet or building a presentation
the size of Baltimore. As the Chairman of the Board would say, “We’re
talkin’ fast, baby, like a rocket ship to the moon!”
✦Core Animation: Leopard adds new functionality within Mac OS X with
the introduction of Core Animation, which makes it much easier for pro-
grammers to animate backgrounds and objects within their programs.
Text, 3-D animation, and video now work seamlessly side-by-side, and
eye-catching animations within applications, like Time Machine, will
soon be the norm for Mac owners.
Stable, stable, stable
“So it’s elegant in design. That’s great, Mark, but what if Mac OS X crashes?
Aqua and Quartz Extreme aren’t worth a plug nickel if my mouse doesn’t
move and I lose my document!” Believe me, I couldn’t agree more; I make my
living from computers, and every time that a misbehaving program locks up
one of my machines, I throw a tantrum that would make Godzilla back off.

Yep, that’s

Lockups shouldn’t be tolerated in this day and age . . . and, unfortunately,
Mac OS 9 crashes almost as often as Windows 98.
Luckily, the folks who designed Mac OS X were just as interested in produc-
ing a rock-solid operating system as they were in designing an attractive
look. (Think of Tom Cruise’s face on The Rock’s body.)
Mac OS X is as hard to crash as the legendary UNIX operating system —
that’s right, the same reliable workhorse that techno-wizards around the
world use to power the Internet, where stability is all-important. In fact, Mac
OS X is actually built on top of a UNIX base. It’s just well hidden underneath,
allowing you and me to focus on our programs and click with a mouse with-
out knowing any of those obscure, arcane keyboard commands. You get the
benefits of UNIX without a pair of suspenders, a pocket protector, or the
hassle of growing a beard. (Not to mention years of computer programming
experience.)
Apple calls this UNIX foundation at the heart of Mac OS X by another nifty
title: Darwin. I could tell you that Darwin provides the latest in 64-bit
memory support and CPU management, but if you’re a normal human being,
your eyes will glaze over. Suffice it to say that Darwin makes the best use of
your computer’s memory (RAM) and your computer’s brain (CPU). Rest
assured that your Web server will stay up even if your misbehaving Virtual
Birdcalling simulation decides to run amok. (Emus running amok . . . how
dreadful.)
Don’t forget QuickTime!
If you’ve recorded or edited digital video (DV),
you’re probably already familiar with Apple’s
QuickTime MOV format. QuickTime movies are
high-resolution, relatively small in size, and
easily created with iMovie, which I discuss in
Book III, Chapter 4. Although QuickTime isn’t “on
stage” all the time like Aqua or Quartz Extreme,
it’s still an important part of Mac OS X: Every time
you display a video clip that you’ve recorded or
watch a streaming TV broadcast from a Web
site, you use QuickTime. (Note, however, that you
don’t use QuickTime to watch DVD movies —
that job is reserved for the Apple DVD Player.)
QuickTime includes support for AVC (Advanced
Video Coding) for the best possible display of the
latest HD (High Definition) video signals from the
expensive hardware that’s now appearing at
your local electronics Maze o’ Wires chain
store.
QuickTime is actually not a new Mac OS X 
feature — it’s been around since the days of
Mac OS 8 — but the latest versions of Mac OS X
include the free QuickTime Player, which pro-
vides support for the latest broadcast and Web
video. In fact, you can set up your own TV sta-
tion on the Web with the tools included in the
Professional QuickTime package.

Convince Me: Why Mac OS X?

Yes, yet another standard is at work here — uh-oh, Overlord Gates is truly
angry now! For those who do have a beard and are curious about such
things, Darwin uses a FreeBSD kernel, so it also inherits all the protocol stan-
dards that have made UNIX the foundation of today’s Internet. You can find
more about FreeBSD at www.freebsd.org. Because Mac OS X is developed
as an open source project, software engineers outside Apple can actually
contribute ideas and code, just like UNIX continues to evolve over time.
(And yes, you’ll even discover how to access the UNIX command prompt
from Mac OS X in Book VII, Chapter 1!)
To get an idea of just how well-armored Mac OS X is, consider Figure 1-5. See
how one program, which I call Titanic 1.0, has locked up like San Quentin.
Under Mac OS 9, your only chance at recovering anything would involve
divine intervention. However, in Mac OS X, my Pages application is unaf-
fected because it has a completely protected area of system memory to play
in. (I show you how to force a misbehaving application to go away in Book I,
Chapter 3.)
By the way, Darwin makes it easy for UNIX software developers to quickly
and easily port (or modify) all sorts of UNIX applications to work under Mac
OS X. I think you’ll agree that a wider selection of applications is a good
thing.
Multitasking and multithreading 
for normal human beings
And now, for your entertainment, a short one-act play. (Yes, really.)

Caesar: Anon, I am only one mortal, yet my Desktop doth abound with
portals to applications of all different mien. Tell me, foul beast, why thy
spirit seems slow and sluggish, and my Excel spreadsheet doth crawl on
its belly!
[Enter Romeo, a cocky and rather brash young Apple software developer.]
Romeo: Dude, the problem is, like, your operating system. Y’see, older
versions of Mac OS ended up constantly, like, shifting your computer’s
attention from one app to another — Excel has to cooperate with every-
thing else that’s running in the background, like a good little corporate
boy. It’s less efficient and very, very ’90s. Upgrade to Mac OS X, and you
get pre-emptive multitasking — the app you’re actually using, like, gets
the lion’s share of the processing time, and everything runs smoother
when you need it. That’s the way UNIX works.
Caesar: Verily, your strange tongue doth annoy me. Guards, behead him —
then obtain for me this Mac OS X.
Romeo: I’m outta here — I’ve got a hot date — but don’t forget, like, Mac
OS X also uses multithreaded processing, so your Mac can handle differ-
ent operating system tasks at the same time. It’s kind of like your com-
puter can both walk and chew gum at the same time: fast, fast, fast!
[Exit Romeo — rather swiftly — stage right.]

When the play closes, we can only hope that Romeo is fast as well. (I told
you it was a short play.)
The definition of Internet-savvy
Remember the classic iMac advertisements that touted the one-plug
approach to the Internet? That entire campaign was centered on one idea:
that the Internet was supposed to be easy to use. The folks at Microsoft sat
up and took notice when the iMac proved so incredibly successful, and
Windows XP actually reduced some of the overwhelming folderol that you
had to encounter just to connect to the Internet — but Mac OS X still wipes
the floor with XP when it comes to easy and complete Internet connectivity.
For example:
✦Easy configuration: Mac OS X sets up your entire Internet connection
with a simple wizard of four screens. As long as you’ve got the right
information handy (which your Internet service provider [ISP] should
supply), it’s a snap to set up.

Convince Me: Why Mac OS X?
18
✦iDisk: What if I told you that for a reasonable yearly subscription fee,
Apple can provide you with a chunk of Internet-accessible, private hard
drive space — and that you can access this hard drive space from any-
where on Earth with an Internet connection? Absolutely, unbelievably,
massively cool. This neat trick is called iDisk, and I cover it in detail in
Book IV, Chapter 4.
✦All the Internet behind-the-scenes stuff: The Internet is basically built
on a number of protocols (read that as rules for exchanging all sorts of
data) — and, as I mention earlier, UNIX machines dominate the Internet.
Ergo, Mac OS X on your Macintosh also provides you with support for
just about every Internet protocol on the planet. Even if you don’t know
them by name or write your own software, the applications that you buy
can use them.
✦A gaggle of great Internet applications: Mac OS X ships with all sorts of
Internet magic built in. For example, you’ll get instant Internet and local
network communication with iChat AV (which I cover in Book IV, Chapter
3), Safari (covered in Book IV, Chapter 5), and Apple Mail, a standard-
issue, battle-ready e-mail program (which I discuss in Book IV, Chapter 2).
Yup, it’s all free.
✦And Apache, sweet Apache: Friends, as a Webmaster myself, I can tell
you that I was visibly moved — well, at least exceptionally excited —
when I discovered that Mac OS X included the industry-standard Apache
Web server, which runs over half of the sites on the Web! (Yep, that
includes www.apple.com.) Get all the details in Book VII, Chapter 4.
Lots of free goodies
You don’t just get Internet applications when you latch your fingers onto a box
o’ Mac OS X — you can start doing all sorts of neat stuff without investing one
extra dollar in more software!
Remember, what you receive along with Mac OS X depends on whether
you’re buying a boxed copy, upgrading from an older version of Mac OS, or
receiving the Big X already installed on a new Macintosh. With that in mind,
check out the possibilities.
✦This is the iLife: This suite of easy-to-use integrated programs is practi-
cally as well known as the Macintosh itself these days: iDVD, iPhoto,
iTunes, GarageBand, iMovie, and iWeb. Each of these stellar programs is
covered in full in Book III. If you’ve got a digital camera, an MP3 player, a
USB musical keyboard, or a DV camcorder, you’ll be a very happy indi-
vidual. I promise.
✦iWork to the rescue: If you’ve bought a new Macintosh with Mac OS X
pre-installed, you’ve also received a test drive version of iWork (Apple’s
answer to Microsoft Office). Good stuff, indeed. If you don’t want to

spend the bucks on Office 2004 and you don’t need the complex gew-
gaws and baroque architecture of Word and PowerPoint, I can guarantee
you that Pages and Keynote are powerful enough to satisfy your office
document and presentation yearnings.
✦The obligatory games: Apple typically chooses new games to bundle
with Macs every three or four months — typically, games are selected
that show off your Mac’s 3-D power, as well as finger-exercising arcade
challenges. Because this book isn’t a game guide, I leave you to explore
these games at your leisure.
Naturally, there are others that I haven’t mentioned here — in fact, programs
like Quicken for Mac have entire For Dummies books devoted to them — but
that gives you a taste of what’s included.
What Do I Really Need to Run the Big X?
I’ve written eight other For Dummies books — I know, it’s getting to be a
habit (and a career) — and I always find the “Hardware Requirements” sec-
tion a hard one to write. Why? Well, I know what Apple claims as the mini-
mum hardware requirements necessary to run Mac OS X. But, on the other
hand, I know what I would consider the minimum hardware requirements,
and they’re substantially different. Oh, well, let me list the bare bones and
then I’ll give you my take on what you really need. (Naturally, if Mac OS X
Leopard is pre-installed already on your computer, feel free to tear out this
page and create a handful of celebratory confetti.)
From The World According to Jobs, the minimum requirements are
✦Hardware: You’ll need any Mac with a G4, G5, or Intel processor —
except for older Macs without internal FireWire hardware and a DVD
drive (these older machines aren’t supported in Mac OS X Leopard).
Other than those exceptions, this means that just about any recent
Desktop or laptop Mac is technically eligible to play (although you might
find the performance of a G4 running Leopard to be unacceptable). I
should also mention that Mac OS X doesn’t support most third-party
CPU upgrade cards out of the box. Again, note that you’ll need a DVD
drive to install Leopard.
✦RAM: You’ll need at least 256MB of memory (RAM) for a Power-PC Mac
and at least 512MB for an Intel Mac. At today’s low prices, that’s like
buying a pizza.
✦Hard drive territory: Although svelte by Windows standards, Mac OS X
still needs about 6GB of free space on your hard drive.

Upgrading from Earlier Versions of Mac OS
20
From The World According to Chambers, the minimum requirements are
✦Hardware: I recommend a Mac with at least a G5 processor. Remember,
this is my take on what you’ll need to really take advantage of Mac OS X
Leopard, and again, I have to say that I don’t think it performs well
enough on slower G4 computers. Of course, if your Mac is lucky enough
to sport an Intel processor, it can use Mac OS X to run rings around a
pokey Pentium PC.
✦RAM: Don’t settle for anything less than 1GB. Again, with memory as
cheap as it is these days, this is like adding extra cheese to that pizza.
Time for a Mark’s Maxim:
Any techno-nerd worth the title will tell you that the single most important
key to performance in today’s operating systems is RAM — yep, it’s actually
more effective than a faster processor!
If you’ve got any extra spending cash in between your sofa cushions,
spend it on RAM. (Up to an Earth-shaking 16GB of RAM on the latest Mac
Pro racehorses!)
✦Hard drive territory: I’d recommend having
• 10GB free for just the operating system
• An additional 20 to 40GB for any digital video clips, photographs, and
songs you’ll be collecting
Upgrading from Earlier Versions of Mac OS
Because the installation of Mac OS is as simple as loading a DVD and double-
clicking an icon, there’s not much to tell. What’s important is the steps that
you should take care of before you start the installation. I cover those in the
next section. Pay heed, or pay later. I won’t go into detail about the actual
installation because there really aren’t any details to speak of — you’ll
answer a question or two and then hop up to get another cup of coffee or
another caffeine-laden soda while the installer does the rest. Would anyone
expect any different from Apple?
Pet peeve number 1 . . . .
The round object that you load into your
CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive is a disc, not a disk,
like your hard drive or that flimsy floppy that
some of the Windows horde still uses. Anyone
who pretends to talk oh-so-knowingly about a
CD-ROM disk or DVD disk is a dweeb, and you
should steer as far away from that dweeb as
possible in the future.

Back up — PLEASE back up
I know you’re anxious to join the In crowd, and Apple makes the upgrade
process as non-invasive and as safe as possible, but SNAFUs like power loss
and hard drive failures do happen. With a full backup of your system on CD
or DVD (or even to an external hard drive), you can rest assured that you’ll
get your precious files and folders back in pristine shape if tragedy strikes.
To be honest, you need to back up your system on a regular basis anyway.
Promise me now that you’ll back up your system, won’t you?

Before you upgrade, I recommend that you check that hard drive for errors
one last time — upgrading a disk with errors takes longer. If you’re upgrading
from an older version of Mac OS X, use Disk Utility, which I cover in Book I,
Chapter 7. Ain’t technology grand?
Plug it, Road Warrior
You’re on the road with your MacBook Pro, and you’ve just bought your
copy of Mac OS X Leopard. You’re thinking of installing your brand-spanking
new operating system. . . . Stop! NOW.
Before you decide to upgrade your Mac notebook, consider what will happen
if that magical vessel containing all your files should flicker and. . . . No, on
second thought, don’t even visualize it. (Even if the battery is fully charged.)
If you’re installing a Mac OS X upgrade on a MacBook or a MacBook Pro,
make sure that it’s plugged in and receiving its share of good, clean AC power
from a handy, nearby wall socket. The installation process could take an hour,
and there’ll be constant hard drive and DVD drive activity — think “Attack of
the Energy Draining Installation from Planet Lithium.” You don’t want to try
this while your notebook is operating on battery power.
What’s that you say? You’d like a comprehensive guide to your classy new
Apple MacBook or MacBook Pro laptop? Look no farther than my bestselling
MacBook For Dummies, published in both print and electronic book format
by the good folks at Wiley . . . with a copy in hand, any road warrior will find
the answers to those Persistent Laptop Questions!
Heck, a techno-purist would probably recommend that you attach your
Macintosh to an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for the installation
process, but I’m not quite that paranoid about power outages.
Keep one thing in mind while installing Mac OS X: If you format the destina-
tion drive — the drive where you’ll install Mac OS X — you’ll lose everything
that it stored. No big surprise there, and the installation program will warn
you profusely about this beforehand. There’s really no reason to do so
unless you just crave a clean installation (an installation of a new operating

Personalizing the Big X

system on a newly formatted drive, compared with an upgrade of your 
existing Mac OS System files). Oh, and don’t forget to use Mac OS Extended
(Journaled) format.
Personalizing the Big X
After the installation is complete and you rebooted the beast, stand back and
watch those beautiful rounded edges, brushed stainless steel surfaces, and
liquid colors appear. But wait — you’re not quite done yet! Mac OS X needs to
be personalized for you, just like your toothbrush or your SUV’s six-way
power seat; therefore, use the Setup Wizard that automatically appears the
first time that you boot Mac OS X Leopard.
These wizard screens change periodically — and they’re completely self-
explanatory — so I won’t march you through each one step by step. However,
here are a few tips that provide a bit of additional over-the-shoulder help
while you’re setting things up.
✦How rude! If you’re outside the United States or other English-speaking
countries, you should know that Mac OS X defaults to U.S. formats and
keyboard layouts. Rest assured, though, because Mac OS X does indeed
provide full support for other languages and keyboard configurations.
To display these options in the list boxes, click the Show All button at
the bottom of the wizard screen.
✦Accounts are important. When Mac OS X asks you to create your
account, don’t forget your password — oh, and they’re case-sensitive, too,
so THIS is different from this or ThiS. It’s a good idea to enter a password
hint, but don’t make that hint too easy to guess. For example, My first dog’s
name is probably preferable to Plays Seinfeld on TV. Mac OS X uses the
name and password that you enter to create your account, which you use
to log in if you set up a multi-user system for several people. (More on this
in Book II, Chapter 4.) Never write down your passwords, either; such crib
sheets work just as well for others as for you.
✦I need to fix that. You can click the Back button any time to return to
previous wizard screens. Mac OS X, being the bright child that it is, auto-
matically saves your choices for you, so when you click Continue to
return, everything is as you left it.
✦Extra stuff. Whether you decide to accept the news, offers, and related-
product information from Apple is your decision. However, it’s only right
that I point out that you can find this same information on the Apple
Web site, so there’s no need to engorge your e-mail Inbox unless you so
desire. (In other words, I turned this off.)

Book I

with Mac OS X

✦Local area network (LAN) connections. If you’re connecting your Mac
to a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network
(or you’re using an Internet router that uses Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol [DHCP]), it’s a good idea to click Yes when you’re asked
whether you should use the configuration supplied by the existing
server.
DHCP automatically provides the computers on the network with all the
settings that they need to connect. If that sounds like ancient Sumerian,
find out more in Book V, Chapter 1.
✦Do create your .Mac account! Apple’s .Mac service just plain rocks —
especially the iDisk storage that you receive. Again, more on this in
Book IV, Chapter 4, but take my word for it. Join up, trooper. (The trial
subscription is free, and it’s easy to upgrade to a full membership if you
decide that you like the .Mac benefits.)
✦Have your Mail settings handy. If you set up your trial .Mac account,
you can set up your @mac.com address without any bother — again,
this is A Good Thing. However, if you’re setting up an existing account,
make sure you have all those silly settings and numbers and names that
your ISP supplied you with when you signed up. This stuff includes your
e-mail address, mail server variety, user account ID, password, and out-
going mail server.

A
s the folks in Cupertino will tell you, “It’s all about the graphics.”
They’re right, of course — Mac OS X is a highly visual operating
system, and using it without a mouse is like building Hoover Dam with a
pocketknife. (And not a particularly sharp pocketknife, either.) Therefore,
most of this chapter will require you to firmly grasp the little rodent — I
introduce you to little graphical bits like icons and menus, and you discover
how to open windows that can display anything from the contents of a docu-
ment to the contents of your hard drive.
On the other hand, any true Macintosh power user will tell you that the key-
board is still a useful piece of hardware. Because I want you to be a bona
fide, well-rounded Mac OS X power user, I also demonstrate those key com-
binations that can save you time, effort, and possible tennis elbow from all
that mouse-wrangling.
Finally, I lead you through the basic training that you’ll need to run your
programs: how to start them, how to open and save documents, and how
to quit an application as gracefully as Fred Astaire on his best day.
Restarting, Sleeping, and Shutting Down
First things first. As the guy on the rocket sled probably yelled, “This is neat,
but how do you stop it?” Call ’em The Big Three — Sleep, Restart, and Shut
Down are the Mac OS X commands that you use when you need to take care
of other business. All three appear on the friendly Apple menu (Ú) at the
top-left corner of your Desktop (as shown in friendly Figure 2-1).

Restarting, Sleeping, and Shutting Down
26
Each of these options produces a different reaction from your Mac:
✦Sleep: You don’t need a glass of water or a bedtime story when you put
Mac OS X to Sleep, which is a power-saving mode that allows you to
quickly return to your work later. (“Waking up” from Sleep mode is much
faster than booting or restarting your computer, and it can conserve 
battery power on laptops.) Depending on the settings that you choose in
System Preferences — which I discuss in Book II, Chapter 3 — your Mac
can power-down the monitor and spin-down the hard drives to save
wear and tear on your hardware. You can set Mac OS X to automatically
enter Sleep mode after a certain amount of mouse and keyboard inactiv-
ity. To awaken your slumbering supercomputer, just click the mouse or
press any key on the keyboard. PowerBook and iBook owners can typi-
cally put their laptops to sleep by simply closing the computer, and
wake the beast by opening it back up again.
✦Restart: Use Restart if your Mac has suddenly decided to work “outside
the box” and begins acting strangely — for instance, if your Universal
Serial Bus (USB) ports suddenly lock up or your FireWire drive no longer
responds. Naturally, you’ll need to save any work that’s open. You also
elect to restart Mac OS X when you switch start-up volumes, or switch
an Intel-based Mac to a Windows XP partition using Boot Camp. (Many
applications and Apple software updates require a restart after you
install them.)
Figure 2-1:

27
✦Shut Down: When you’re ready to return to the humdrum, real world
and you’re done with your Mac for the time being, use the Shut Down
option. Well-behaved Mac applications will automatically prompt you to
save any changes that you’ve made to open documents before the com-
puter actually turns itself off (or restarts itself). If you’ve configured
your Mac with multiple accounts, you can shut down Mac OS X from the
login screen as well.
Besides the Apple menu command, many Macs have a Power key on the key-
board that you can press to display the dialog that you see in Figure 2-2. If
you change your mind and decide to tie up loose ends before you leave, click
the Cancel button to return to Mac OS X.
If your Mac has a Drive Eject key that you use to load and eject discs, you
can hold down the Control key and press the Drive Eject key to display the
same options.
Figure 2-2:

Actually, we’re not finished just yet. . . .
I should probably also mention the other guys:
the Log Out command (which you can find
under the Apple menu) and the User Switch
menu (at the right side of the Finder menu).
 Choose Log Out when you’re running your
Mac with multiple users and you want to
completely pass control over to another
person. All your programs will quit, and the
other person can take over by logging in
with his/her account. Mac OS X then recon-
figures with the other user’s preferences.
 If you’ve enabled Fast User Switching,
another user can log in from the User Switch
menu. However, your applications don’t quit,
you don’t have to formally log out, and you
can take control back when the other user
is finished. (Hence the words Fast and
Switching in the name.) To turn on this fea-
ture, log in with an administrator account,
display the Accounts panel in System
Preferences, click Login Options, and then
select the Enable Fast User Switching check
box. (More on Fast User Switching appears
in Book II, Chapter 4.)

A Window Is Much More Than a Frame
28
A Window Is Much More Than a Frame
“And in the beginning, there was the window.” Like older Mac operating 
systems, most of what you’ll do in Mac OS X occurs within these fancy rec-
tangular frames. And, as you might imagine, a number of controls are at your
disposal, which you can use to control the size, shape, and appearance of
these potent portals. In this section, I’ll — well, to be blunt, I’ll do windows.
(No squeegee jokes, if you please.)
Opening and closing windows
Windows are generally opened automatically. Usually, a window gets opened
by an application (when you first run it or it needs to display a document) or
by Mac OS X itself (when the Finder opens a window to display the contents
of your hard drive). The Finder, by the way, is the application that Mac OS X
runs to display the operating system’s menus and windows.
Some programs even let you open new windows on the fly: For example,
Figure 2-3 illustrates a window in its purest form: a new Finder window. To
display this window on your own Mac, choose File➪New Finder Window or
press Ô+N. From here, you can reach any file on your Mac or even venture
to the Internet.

A Window Is Much More Than a Frame
29
The Command key has both an Apple (Ú) and a rather strange-looking
symbol (Ô) on it that I often call the Spirograph.
When you’re finished with a document or you no longer need a window
open, you can close it to free that space on your Desktop. To close a window
in Mac OS X, move your mouse pointer over the Close button; it’s the red 
circular button at the top-left corner of the window (see Figure 2-3). An X
appears on the button when you’re in the zone. When the X appears, just
click the mouse.
If you’ve been living the life of a hermit in a cave for the last decade or so,
pressing the mouse button is called clicking the mouse. In the Apple uni-
verse, a standard mouse or trackpad may only sport one button; if you’re
using an Apple Mighty Mouse, a trackball or an uber-mouse with a right
mouse button, a right click usually acts the same as holding down the
Control key while you click with a standard Apple mouse.
Most Mac applications don’t want you closing a window willy-nilly if you’ve
changed the contents without saving them. For example, try to close a docu-
ment window in Word or Pages without saving the file first. The program will
ask you for confirmation before it closes the window containing your Great
American Novel. Most programs also have a Close command on their File
menu.
To close all windows that are displayed by a particular program, hold down
the Option key while you click the Close button on one of the windows.
Whoosh! They’re all gone.
Scrolling windows
Often more stuff is in a document or more files are on your hard drive than
you can see in the space available for a window. Guess that means it’s time
to delete stuff. No, no, just joking! You don’t have to take such drastic meas-
ures to see more in a window.
Just use the scroll bars that you see in Figure 2-4 to move through the con-
tents of the window. You click the scroll bar and drag it — for the uninitiated,
that means clicking the bar and holding down the mouse button while you
move the mouse in the desired direction. Alternatively, you can click in the
empty area above or below the bar to scroll pages one at a time.
Depending on the type of application that you’re using, you might be able to
scroll a window with your arrow keys as well — or perhaps use the Page Up
and Page Down keys to move through a window.

A Window Is Much More Than a Frame
30
Minimizing and restoring windows
The multitalented Figure 2-4 also displays another control that you can use
with a window: the Minimize button. When you minimize a window, you
eliminate it from your Desktop and store it safely in the Dock — that strip of
icons that appears along the bottom (or the side) of your Mac OS X Desktop.
In fact, a minimized window appears as a miniature icon in the Dock, so you
can actually keep an eye on it (so to speak). Figure 2-5 illustrates a mini-
mized window from Safari, which is actually displaying my Web site at www.
mlcbooks.com. To minimize a window, move your mouse pointer over the
yellow Minimize button at the top-left corner of the window — a minus sign
appears on the button — and then click.

You’re gonna love this “Easter Egg” hidden in Mac OS X — if you hold down
the Shift key whilst you minimize, the window shrinks in cool slow motion.
(Who says operating systems have to be totally serious, anyway?)
When you’re ready to display the window again on your Desktop — a process
called restoring the window — simply click the thumbnail icon representing
the window in the Dock, and Mac OS X automagically returns it to its former
size and location.
By the way, some — note that I said some — applications continue to run
when minimized, while others will simply stop or pause until you return
them to the Desktop. Such is the crazy world we live in.
Zooming windows
Zooming windows has a kind of Flash Gordon sound to it, don’t you think?
It’s nothing quite that exciting — no red tights or laser guns — still, when
you’re trying to view a larger portion of a document, zooming is a good thing
because it expands the window to the maximum practical size for the appli-
cation that you’re using. In some cases, zooming a window fills the entire
screen; at other times, the extra space would be wasted, so the application
zooms the window to the maximum size that shows as much content as pos-
sible (without any unnecessary white space). In fact, the Zoom button can
even be disabled by an application that doesn’t want you to muck about
with the window; for example, I own a game or two that don’t allow zooming.
To zoom a window, move your mouse pointer over the green Zoom button at
the top-left corner of the window. Again, Figure 2-4 struts its stuff and illus-
trates the position. (Man, that is one versatile figure.) A plus sign appears on
the Zoom button. Click to expand your horizons.
After you’ve finished with a zoomed window, you can return it to its previous
dimensions by clicking the Zoom button again.
Toggling toolbars
If you’re wondering what that little lozenge-shaped button is at the right
corner of many Mac OS X application windows, I won’t leave you in suspense:
This button toggles the display of the window’s toolbar on and off. A toolbar
is a strip of icons that appears across the top of a window that you can click
to perform common commands, like changing the display format or printing
the current document. (The toolbar in Figure 2-4, for example, features icons
to move Back and Forward, among others.) You’ll encounter more toolbar
technology throughout the book.

A Window Is Much More Than a Frame
32
Moving windows
Unlike the rather permanent windows in your home, you can pick a window
and cart it to another portion of the Desktop. Typically, this is done when
you’re using more than one application at a time, and you need to see the
contents of multiple windows. To grab a window and make off with it, click
the window’s title bar — the strip at the top of the window that usually bears
a document or application name — and drag the window to the new loca-
tion. Then release the mouse button to plant it firmly in the new location.
By the way, some applications allow you to arrange multiple windows in a
graceful swoop with a single click of a menu. Click the Window menu and
choose Arrange All to perform this magic.
I talk about Exposé and Spaces later in the section, “Switching ’Twixt Programs
with Aplomb.” Exposé helps you organize a large number of open windows on
your Desktop. You can use it to display all open application windows so that
you can pick the one you want . . . or even display all the windows opened by
a specific application. Spaces, which is new in Leopard, allows you to create
entire custom virtual desktops. (Truly cool.) Each of your Spaces desktops can
contain a different set of application windows that you use for different tasks!
Resizing windows
Next, consider how to change the width or height of your window. To change
the dimensions of a window to your exact specifications, move your mouse
pointer over the lower-right corner of the window (which is usually marked
with a number of slashed lines to indicate its status as a control), click, and
drag until the window is the size that you prefer.
Switching windows
Before I move to other graphical wonders of Mac OS X, it’s important that
you master how to switch between windows on your Desktop. First, remem-
ber this old Norwegian saying (or is it one of Mark’s Maxims?):
Only one window can be active at once.
What our Oslo friends are communicating is that only one window can be
active at any time. The active window appears on top of other windows, and
it’s the one that you can edit by typing or by moving your mouse. (It also
sports Close, Minimize, and Zoom buttons in color.) Other windows that 
you have opened might be minimized, as I describe earlier in the section
“Minimizing and restoring windows,” or they can be inactive (mere ghosts of
themselves) and remain on your Desktop. Mac OS X dims the controls for
inactive windows so that you can tell they’re hanging around . . . but you
can’t use them at the moment. Figure 2-6 illustrates a number of open 
windows, with the iTunes window active.

Book I
Chapter 2

A Window Is Much More Than a Frame
33
I know you’re going to get tired of hearing me say this, but here I go again:
Certain applications will continue to run while their windows are inactive,
like File Transfer Protocol (FTP) clients and such. Most programs, however,
stop or pause until you make their window active.
And how do you switch to — activate — a different window in Mac OS X?
Again, Exposé allows you to activate another window, but if the window is
currently visible, you can simply click any part of that window. I generally
click the window’s title bar if it’s visible, but any part of the inactive window
will do. The window that you click leaps like a proud stallion to the fore, and
the previously active window now skulks in the background.
You can still use a window’s Close, Minimize, and Zoom buttons even when
the window is inactive.
Figure 2-6:
Many are
open, but
only one is
active.

Menu Mysteries Explained
34
Menu Mysteries Explained
Next, I move on to menu control in Mac OS X. Menus are handy drop-down
controls that allow you to select commands that are grouped together logi-
cally. For example, an application’s File menu will usually allow you to create
or open a document, save a document to disk, or quit the program. To pull
down a menu, click the desired menu group name on the bar at the top of
the screen and then click the desired menu option from the extended menu.
Figure 2-7 illustrates the Safari menu: Note the submenus designated by right-
arrow icons. When you move your mouse pointer over a submenu command,
you get another set of even more specific menu commands — in this case, the
Services submenu command displays commands, like Mail and Grab.
Some applications allow you to create your own custom menus; naturally,
configuring a new menu system takes some time to figure out, but imagine
the productivity gains that you’ll enjoy! For example, my menus in Microsoft
Word 2004 for Mac feature only the commands that I use often — they’re
sleeker and easier to navigate. (However, you have to stop short of claiming
that you wrote the application. And yes, I already checked with Microsoft,
which got downright snippy about it.)
Mac OS X also provides another type of menu: contextual. A contextual menu
appears when you hold down the Control key and click certain items on the
screen, revealing commands that relate specifically to that item. (Unfortunately,
the items that sport contextual menus vary from application to application, so
it’s best to check the documentation for a program before you spend countless
hours Control-clicking everything onscreen.) The same items in the Control-
click menu appear when you select an item and then click the Action pop-up
menu, which looks like a mechanical gear.
As I mention earlier, many manufacturers sell mice, trackballs, and other
pointing things that include a secondary mouse button. This is still somewhat
of a Windows trait — remember, Apple feels that a second button is mere 
filigree for MacBook or MacBook Pro — but if you have one, the device might
display contextual menus when you click the secondary button. (This is often
called right-clicking because the left mouse button is typically the primary
button.) Then again, you might launch Aunt Harriet into a geosynchronous
orbit, so double-check the manual for your pointing thing on the default
button assignment (and how to change it, if necessary).
You’ll note that many commands in menus have keyboard shortcuts. Because
I’ll be holding forth on this subject in the upcoming section, “Keyboard
Shortcuts for the True Power User,” I’ll hold off describing them here.

Icons ’R Us
Icons are more than little pictures. They’re . . . well . . . actually, I guess
they’re little pictures. However, these graphical WUDs (that’s short for
Wonderful User Devices) are really representations of the components 
of your Mac OS X system, and therefore they deserve a section of their 
own.
For complete details on what any icon is, what it represents, and what it does,
click the icon once to highlight it and then press Ô+I. This displays the Info
dialog that you see in Figure 2-8, which tells you what kind of icon it is, where
the item it represents is actually located, and how big it is. You’ll also see a
version number for applications — a handy way of quickly checking what ver-
sion of a program you’re running — and when the file was created and last
modified. The Info dialog also offers other settings and options that you can
display by clicking in the General section, and I cover them in other parts of
the book.

Hardware
Mac OS X uses icons to represent the various hardware devices of your
computer, including your
✦Hard drive
✦CD or DVD drive
✦Printer
✦iPod
You get the idea. Just double-click a hardware icon to display the folders and
files that it contains, like with your hard drive and CD/DVD drive.
Generally, you’ll only encounter hardware icons on your Desktop or in Finder
windows. Figure 2-9 illustrates some of the hardware icons that live in my
system.

Programs and applications
These are the fancy icons, folks. Most applications have their own custom
icons, and double-clicking one will typically whisk you on your way. Mac OS
X also includes a generic icon or two for applications that don’t include their
own custom icon. Figure 2-10 illustrates a number of my favorite program
icons from all sorts of Mac OS X applications.
Running a program in Mac OS X can be as simple as double-clicking the
application icon — more on this later in the section, “Houston, We’re Go to
Launch Programs.”
Files
Your hard drive will contain many thousands of individual files, and the 
Big X tries to make it as easy as possible to visually identify which applica-
tion owns which file. Therefore, most applications use a special icon to indi-
cate their data files. For example, Figure 2-11 illustrates several documents
and data files created by a range of applications: Microsoft Word, Pages,
QuickTime, Safari, and Adobe Acrobat. Some cheeky applications even use
more than one icon to differentiate between different file types, like docu-
ments and templates in Microsoft Word.
A number of generic file icons indicate text files, including RTF (short for rich
text format) documents and PDF (Portable Document Format) documents,
which use the Adobe Acrobat format.
You can open most documents and data files by double-clicking them, which
automatically launches the proper application and loads the document.

Folders
Folders have a 3-D look in Mac OS X — and, as you can see in Figure 2-12,
some applications even customize their folder icon!
Major system folders — including Applications, Library, System, Users,
Downloads, and Utilities — now sport new folder icons in Leopard that help
identify their contents.
To open a folder within Mac OS X, just double-click it. (Alternatively, you can
click it once to select it and then press Ô+O.) Discover more about how to
control the look of folder contents in Book II, Chapter 1.
Aliases
An alias is a strange beast. Although it might look like a standard icon, upon
closer examination, you’ll notice that an alias icon sports a tiny curved
arrow at the base, and the tag alias usually appears at the end of the icon
name. Figure 2-13 has roped in a variety of aliases for your enjoyment, along
with one or two actual icons for comparison.

Essentially, an alias is a link to something else on your system. For example, a
Photoshop alias can run Photoshop just like the actual program icon, but it
takes up only a scant few bytes on your hard drive. (If you’re a Switcher who’s
just crossed over from the Windows Wilderness, think shortcut — Windows
shortcuts work in a similar manner.) The alias file is just big enough to hold
the location of the actual file or folder, allowing it to yell at Mac OS X: “Hey, the
Human actually wants you to run this or open that thing over there!”
Aliases come in handy for a number of reasons:
✦They allow you to launch applications and open files and folders from
anywhere in your system. For example, you might want an alias icon in
your MP3 folder that runs the DVD burning application Toast so that you
can launch Toast and burn an audio CD without laboriously navigating
to the Toast folder, which could be nested in goodness-knows-how-many
layers of subfolders.
✦They can be easily deleted when no longer needed without wreaking
havoc on the original application, file, or folder. If you decide that
you’d rather use iTunes to burn audio CDs, you can simply delete the
Toast alias without trashing Toast itself.
✦Their tiny size allows you to add multiple aliases (and mucho conven-
ience) for a single application without gulping down hard drive space.
You might be wondering, “Why use aliases when I can just copy the actual
application, file, or folder to the desired spot?” Well, indeed you can do that.
However, the application might not work in its new location because you
didn’t copy any of the supporting files that most applications need to run.
(An alias actually runs the original application or opens the original file or
folder, so things should work just as if you double-clicked the original icon.)
Additionally, remember that copying applications willy-nilly throughout your
hard drive will eat up territory like a horde of angry Vikings.

Selecting Icons for Fun and Profit
40
If you dislike the alias hanging off the end of the icon name, feel free to
rename it (as I show you in Chapter 3 of this mini-book). The alias will con-
tinue to function nicely no matter what moniker you give it. (If you create an
alias by holding down Ô+Option whilst dragging the original icon to a new
location, the alias name won’t include the alias appendage.)
If the original file no longer exists, an alias naturally no longer works, either.
However, Mac OS X is sharp enough to automatically “fix” an alias if you
rename or move the original file, pointing it to the new location. Slick!
Selecting Icons for Fun and Profit
You’ll often find yourself performing different actions on one icon — or a
number of icons at one time. For example, you can copy or move files from
one location on your hard drive to another or delete a group of files that you
no longer need. (The idea of drag-and-drop file management using icons orig-
inated on the Macintosh, but I’ll wait until Chapter 3 of this mini-book to
describe these operations in detail.) For now, focus on the basics of select-
ing one or more icons, which specifies which files and folders that you want
to use for whatever you’re going to do next.
Selecting a single icon
First, here are the various ways that you can select a single icon for an
impending action:
✦Place your mouse pointer over the file and click once. Mac OS X dark-
ens the icon to indicate that it’s selected — a mysterious process called
highlighting.
✦Type the first few letters of the icon’s name. After you type enough
characters to identify the icon uniquely (whether it be one or a dozen),
Mac OS X highlights the icon that matches the text string.
✦If an icon in a window is already highlighted, you can move the high-
light to the next icon across by pressing the right-arrow key. Likewise,
the other three directional arrow keys move the highlight in the other
directions. To move through the icons alphabetically, press Tab to go
forward and Shift+Tab to go backward.
Selecting multiple icons
To select a gaggle of icons for an action, use one of these methods:
✦If the icons are next to each other, click and drag within the window
(and not directly on a specific item) to highlight them all. While you
drag, Mac OS X displays a selection box, and any icons you touch with
that box will be highlighted when you release the mouse button (as
shown in Figure 2-14). Think “lasso,” and you’ll get the picture.

✦You can also select multiple adjacent icons by clicking the first item to
highlight it and then holding down the Shift key while clicking the last
icon in the series that you want to select.
If the icons are not next to each other, you can hold down the Ô key
while you click each item that you want to select.
Just selecting an icon doesn’t launch or do anything . . . you’re just marking
your territory.
Keyboard Shortcuts for the True Power User
Virtually all Mac OS X applications have their own keyboard shortcuts — a
ten-cent term for a key combination that performs the same operation as a
menu command or a toolbar button. Although the mouse might seem the
easier path when controlling your Mac, it’s not always the fastest. Those
hardy souls who venture to learn common keyboard shortcuts can zip
through a spreadsheet or warp through a complex outline at speeds that no
mere rodent-wrangler could ever hope to attain.
With that in mind — and with the goal of “pumping you up” into a power
user — I hereby present the most common keyboard shortcuts for the Big X
in Table 2-1. I’ve also sprinkled other keyboard shortcuts liberally through
the book when I discuss other applications, but these combinations are the
classics that appear virtually everywhere.

By the way, I should mention that many keyboard combinations use three

down the first two keys simultaneously and press the third key. Common
“strange” key symbols that you’ll see in both the Finder and most applica-
tions are shown in Table 2-2.

Houston, We’re Go to Launch Programs
The next stop on your introductory tour of Mac OS X is the launch pad for
your applications — although the Finder is useful, you’ll likely want to actu-
ally do something with your Mac as well.
Running applications from your hard drive
You can launch an application from your hard drive by
✦Navigating to the corresponding application folder — by either clicking
or double-clicking drive and folder icons — and double-clicking the
application icon.
✦Double-clicking a document or data file that’s owned by the application.
For example, double-clicking an MP3 audio file will run iTunes.
✦Double-clicking an alias that you’ve created for the application. (Get the
skinny on aliases in the earlier section, “Aliases.” I’ll wait.)
✦Clicking the application’s icon in the Dock (more on adding items to the
Dock in Book II, Chapter 2).
✦Selecting the application icon and pressing the Ô+O keyboard shortcut.
✦Clicking the Menu button on your Apple Remote to display the Front
Row menu. From here, you can choose to watch a DVD movie (using
Apple’s DVD Player), peruse your collection of digital images (using
iPhoto), watch a video you’ve created (using iMovie), or listen to music
(using iTunes). The applications are launched automatically when you
select the media you want to play. (You’ll find more on Front Row in
Chapter 5 of this mini-book.)
✦Adding the application to your Startup items list. (I cover this in more
detail in Book II, Chapter 3.)
Running applications from a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM
After you load a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, you can display its contents by
double-clicking the disc icon that appears on your Desktop. A Finder window
opens and shows the files that reside on the disc (see Figure 2-15).
After you locate the application you want to run on the disc, you can launch
it by double-clicking it or selecting it and pressing Ô+O.

Switching ’Twixt Programs with Aplomb
You might think that juggling multiple applications will lead to confusion,
fatigue, and dry mouth, but luckily Mac OS X makes it easy to jump between
programs that are running on your Mac. Use any of these methods to jump
from open application to application:
✦Click anywhere in the desired application window to make it the
active window.
✦Click the application icon in the Dock. All applications that are running
have an icon in the Dock, and the icon will have a shiny dot beneath it to
indicate that the application is open.
✦Press Ô+Tab. If you’ve got a dozen windows open, this can get a bit
tedious, which leads us to one of Leopard’s sassiest features, brazenly
named Exposé, which is shown in Figure 2-16. (Am I stretching things a
bit? You say that technology doesn’t compare to the glamour of
Hollywood? Then take in a Steve Jobs keynote address at the yearly
Macworld convention! The man is a superstar. Poor Bill. . . .)

✦Press F9 to show all open application windows using Exposé; then
click the one that you want. Figure 2-16 illustrates the tiled window dis-
play on my Mac after I press F9. Your cursor changes into the traditional
(and so very elegant) gloved hand. Move the cursor on top of the
window that you want to activate — the window turns blue when it’s
selected — and click once to switch to that window. You can specify
which keys you want to use to control Exposé within System
Preferences.
✦Press F10 to show all open windows from the application that you’re
currently using; then click the one that you want to activate. This
Exposé function is great for choosing from all the images that you’ve
opened in Photoshop or all the Safari Web pages littering your Desktop!
Along with the window switch, an astute observer will notice that the appli-
cation menu bar will also change to match the now-active application.
Besides the F9 and F10 hot keys that I just discussed, Exposé provides one
more nifty function: Press F11, and all your open windows scurry to the side
of the screen. (Much like a herd of zebras if you dropped a lioness in the
middle.) Now you can work with drives, files, and aliases on your Desktop —
and when you’re ready to confront those dozen application windows again,
just press F11 a second time.

Ah, but what if you want to switch to an entirely different set of applications?
For example, let’s suppose that you’re slaving away at your pixel-pushing 
job — designing a magazine cover with Pages. Your page design desktop also
includes Photoshop and Aperture, which you switch between often using
one of the techniques I just described. Suddenly, however, you realize you
need to schedule a meeting with others in your office using iCal, and you
also want to check your e-mail in Apple Mail. What to do?
Well, you could certainly launch those two applications on top of your graph-
ics applications, and then minimize or close them . . . but with Leopard’s 
new Spaces feature, you can press the Ctrl+Left Arrow or Ctrl+Right Arrow
sequences to switch to a completely different “communications” desktop, with
iCal and Apple Mail windows already open and in your favorite positions!
(Figure 2-17 illustrates the Spaces screen, showing two available desktops.)
After you’re done setting up your meeting and answering any important
e-mail, simply press Ctrl+Left Arrow or Ctrl+Right Arrow again to switch
back to your “graphics” desktop, where all your work is exactly as you left it!
Now imagine that you’ve also created a custom “music” desktop for
GarageBand and iTunes . . . or perhaps you paired iWeb, .Mac, and iPhoto
together as a “Webmaster” desktop. See why everyone’s so excited? (Let’s
see Windows Vista do that out of the box.)

Unlike Exposé, Spaces has to be enabled and configured before you can use
it — you can create new desktops, customize your desktops, and even
choose a different set of key sequences to activate Spaces from within
System Preferences. For the complete story on configuring Spaces, see 
Book II, Chapter 3.
Opening and Saving Your Stuff in an Application
Almost all Mac OS X applications open and save documents in the same way,
whether you’re creating a presentation with Keynote or expressing your
cinematic side with iMovie. Therefore, I’m going to take a moment to outline
the common procedures for opening and saving documents. Believe me,
you’ll perform these two rituals dozens of times a week, so no nodding off.
Opening a document
First, the simple way to load a document: Double-click that document in a
Finder window, and . . . well, that’s it. (This is my preferred method because
I’m an ALT — short for Admitted Lazy Techno-wizard — who would rather
use complex hand movements to pour myself another Diet Coke.)
To open a document the hard way — from inside an application — here’s the
plan:
1. Choose File➪Open or press that handy Ô+O key combination.
Your Mac OS X program is likely to display the attractive Open dialog
that you see in Figure 2-18.
Figure 2-18:
The soon-
to-be-quite-
familiar
Open dialog.

Opening and Saving Your Stuff in an Application
48
2. Navigate to the location of the document that you want to open.
The pop-up menu allows you to jump directly to common locations —
such as the Desktop, your Home folder, and your iDisk — as well as
places that you’ve recently accessed (Recent Places).
If the target folder isn’t in your pop-up menu, move the slider at the
bottom of the dialog to the far left to display your hard drives, CD-ROM/
DVD drives, and network locations.
3. Click the habitat where the file will be found.
You’ll note that the right column(s) will change to show you the con-
tents of the item that you just clicked. In this way, you can cruise
through successive folders to find that elusive document. (This some-
what time-consuming process is somewhat derisively called drilling —
hence, the importance of using Recent Items, or dragging files, locations,
and applications into the sidebar at the left of the Finder.)
4. When you sight the document that you want to load, either double-
click it or click once to highlight the filename and then click Open.
“Hey, the Open dialog can be resized!” That’s right, good buddy — you can
expand the Open dialog to show more columns and find things more easily.
Click and drag the bottom-right corner of the Open dialog to resize it. (You
can also switch from column view to list view, just like a Finder window,
using the buttons to the left of the pop-up location menu.)
Saving a document
To save a document, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Save.
If you’ve previously saved this document, your application should imme-
diately overwrite the existing document with the new copy, and you get
to return to work . . . end of story. If you haven’t previously saved this
document, the program will display a Save dialog that’s usually very sim-
ilar to the Open dialog; it generally has a few more options, however, so
stay frosty.
2. Navigate to the location where you’d like to save the document and
then type a filename.
Often, you can use a default name that’s already provided by the
thoughtful folks who developed the software. Note that you might be
given the chance to save the document in several different formats. For
example, a word processing application might allow you to save a docu-
ment in RTF, HyperText Markup Language (HTML), and even bargain-
basement text format.

3. Click Save (or OK, depending on the application).
If an application offers a Save As menu option in the File menu, you can in
effect copy the document by saving a new version of the document under
another name. Save As comes in particularly handy when you want to retain
the original version of a document.
Quitting Programs
If I had a twisted and warped sense of humor, I’d simply tell you to quit appli-
cations by pulling your Mac’s power cord from the wall socket. (Luckily, I
don’t.) There are, however, more sane ways to exit a program — use one of
these methods instead:
✦Press the Ô+Q keyboard shortcut.
✦Choose the Application’s named menu and then click Quit.
✦Control-click (or right-click) the application icon on the Dock and click
Quit on the pop-up menu that appears.
You can also click the Close button on the application window. Note, how-
ever, that this doesn’t always completely close down the application. For
example, Safari stays running even if you close the browser window.

fter you master basic Mac spell-casting — things like selecting items,
using menus, opening and saving documents, working with windows,
and launching an application or two — it’s time to delve deeper into Mac OS
X. (Can you tell I’m a Dungeons & Dragons old-timer?)
In this chapter, I discuss file management, showing you the hidden power
behind the friendly Apple menu. I also discuss some of the more advanced
menu commands, how to print within most applications, and how to listen
to an audio CD on your Mac. (It makes a doggone good stereo.) Finally, I
introduce you to the built-in CD/DVD recording features within the Big X 
and how to add a standard USB printer to your system.
The Finder: It’s the Wind beneath Your Wings
So what exactly is the Finder anyway? It’s a rather nebulous term, but in
essence, the Finder gives Mac OS X the basic functions that you’ll use for the
procedures that I outline in this chapter. This multitasking UberOS has been
around in one guise or another since the days of System 6 — the creaking
old days when a Mac was an all-in-one, toteable computer with a built-in
screen. Come to think of it, some things never change.

The Finder: It’s the Wind beneath Your Wings
52
The Finder is always running, so it’s always available — and you can always
switch to it, even when several other applications are open and chugging
away. Figure 3-1 illustrates the Dock with the rather perspective-crazy Finder
icon at the far left side.
Is that icon supposed to be one face or two faces? I’m still confused, and I’ve
been using the Mac now since 1989.
Don’t forget that Mac OS X gives you a second method of doing everything I
cover in this chapter: You can use Terminal to uncover the UNIX core of Mac
OS X, employing your blazing typing speed to take care of things from the
command line. Of course, that’s not the focus of this book, but for those 
who want to boldly go where no Mac operating system has ever gone before,
you’ll find more in Book VII, Chapter 1. Despite what you might have been
led to believe, power and amazing speed are to be found in character-based
computing.

Copying and Moving Files and Folders
53
Copying and Moving Files and Folders
Here’s where drag-and-drop makes things about as easy as computing 
can get:
✦To copy a file or folder from one window to another location on the
same drive: Hold down the Option key and click and drag the icon from
its current home to the new location. (Note: You can drop files and fold-
ers on top of other folders, which puts the copy inside that folder.) If
you’re copying multiple items, select them first (read how in Book I,
Chapter 2) and then drag and drop the entire crew.
“Is the Desktop a valid target location for a file or folder?” You’re darn
tootin’! I recommend, though, that you avoid cluttering up your Desktop
with more than a handful of files. Instead, create a folder or two on your
Desktop and then store those items within those folders. If you work
with the contents of a specific folder often, drag it into the Places head-
ing in the Sidebar (the column at the left side of any Finder window), and
you can open that folder from the Finder with a single click — no matter
where you are! (Alternatively, drag the folder to the Dock and drop it
there, and you can open it with a single click from anywhere.)
✦To copy items from one window to a location on another drive: Click
and drag the icon from the window to a window displaying the contents
of the target drive. Or, in the spirit of drag-and-drop, you can simply drag
the items to the drive icon, which places them in the root folder of that
drive.
✦To move items from one window to another location on the same
drive: Simply drag the icon to the new location, whether it be a window
or a folder.
Mac OS X provides you with a number of visual cues to let you know what’s
being copied or moved. For example, dragging one or more items displays a
ghost image of the items, and when you’ve positioned the mouse pointer
over the target, Mac OS X highlights that location to let you know that you’re
in the zone. If you’re moving or copying items into another Finder window,
the window border is highlighted to let you know that Mac OS X understands
the game plan.
In case you move the wrong thing or you port it to the wrong location, press
Ô+Z to undo the previous action.
If the item that you’re dragging already exists in the target location, you get a
confirmation dialog like the one you see in Figure 3-2. You can choose to
replace the file, leave the existing file alone, or stop the entire shooting
match.

Cloning Your Items — It’s Happening Now!
54
Cloning Your Items — It’s Happening Now!
No need for sci-fi equipment or billions in cash — you can create an exact
duplicate of any item within the same folder. (This is often handy when you
need a simple backup of the same file in the same folder or when you’re
going to edit a document but you want to keep the original intact.)
Click the item to select it and then choose File➪Duplicate. To distinguish the
duplicate from the original, Mac OS X adds the word copy to the end of the
duplicate’s icon name; additional copies have a number added to the name
as well.
Alternatively, keyboard aficionados can hold down the Option key and drag
the original item to another spot in the same window — when you release
the button, the duplicate appears.
Heck, if you prefer the Control key, you can hold it down while clicking the
item and then choose Duplicate from the contextual menu that appears.
Decisions, decisions . . . .
Oh, and don’t forget that Action button (it looks like a little gear with a
downward-pointing arrow) on the Finder toolbar (refer to Figure 3-1). You
could also click the Action button and choose Duplicate from the pop-up
menu.
When you duplicate a folder, Mac OS X automatically duplicates all the con-
tents of the folder as well. Remember that this could take some time if the
folder contains a large number of small files (or a small number of large
files). Groucho would’ve loved computers!
Deleting That Which Should Not Be
Even Leonardo da Vinci made the occasional design mistake — his trash can
was likely full of bunched-up pieces of parchment. Luckily, no trees will be
wasted when you decide to toss your unneeded files and folders; this section
shows you how to delete items from your system.

Emptying That Wastepaper Basket
55
By the way, as you’ll soon witness for yourself, moving items to the Trash
doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re immediately history.
Dragging unruly files against their will
In Mac OS X, the familiar Macintosh Trash can has been moved to the right
edge of the Dock — in fact, it’s now a spiffy-looking wire can instead of the
old clunker that the Mac faithful remember. You can click and drag the items
that you’ve selected to the Trash and drop them on top of the wire can icon
to delete them. When the Trash contains at least one item, the wire can icon
changes to appear as if it were full of trash.
You can also add a Delete icon to your Finder toolbar — for all the details,
see Book II, Chapter 1.
Deleting with the menus and the keyboard
The mouse isn’t absolutely necessary when deleting items. Your other
options for scrapping selected files include
✦Choosing File from the Finder menu and choosing the Move to Trash
menu item
✦Pressing the Ô+Delete keyboard shortcut
✦Clicking the Action button on the Finder toolbar and selecting Move to
Trash from the pop-up menu
✦Holding down Control while clicking the item to display the contextual
menu and then choosing Move to Trash from that menu
Emptying That Wastepaper Basket
As I mention earlier, moving items to the Trash doesn’t actually delete them
immediately from your system. Believe me, this fail-safe measure comes in
handy when you’ve been banging away at the keyboard for several hours
and you stop paying close attention to what you’re doing. (I usually also
blame lack of Diet Coke.) More on how to rescue files from the Trash in the
next section.
Like any folder, you can check the contents of the Trash by clicking the
Trash icon in the Dock.
After you double-check the Trash contents and you’re indeed absolutely
sure you want to delete its contents, use one of the following methods to
nuke the digital Bit Bucket:

WAIT! I Need That After All!
56
✦Choose the Empty Trash menu item from the Finder menu.
✦Choose Secure Empty Trash from the Finder menu.
Believe it or not, if you use the standard Empty Trash command, you
haven’t completely zapped that refuse! Some third-party hard drive
repair and recovery programs will allow an uncool person to restore
items from the Trash. Use the Secure Empty Trash method for those sen-
sitive files and folders that you want to immediately and irrevocably
delete — the data is overwritten with random characters, making it
impossible to recover. (A great idea for that Mac you want to sell on
eBay, no? In fact, if you like, you can reinstall Mac OS X before you ship
the Mac, leaving the Install wizard ready-to-run for the new owner.)
✦Press the Ô+Shift+Delete keyboard shortcut.
✦Click the Trash icon in the Dock, hold down the mouse button, and
choose Empty Trash from the menu that appears.
✦Hold down Control while clicking the Trash icon in the Dock and then
choose Empty Trash from the contextual menu that appears.
Depending on the method that you select and the settings that you choose
in System Preferences (which I cover in Book II, Chapter 3), Mac OS X might
present you with a confirmation dialog to make sure that you actually want
the Trash emptied.
WAIT! I Need That After All!
In the adrenaline-inducing event that you need to rescue something that
shouldn’t have ended up in the scrap pile, first click the Trash icon in the
Dock to display the contents of the Trash. Then rescue the items that you
want to save by dragging them to the Desktop or a folder on your hard drive.
(This is roughly analogous to rescuing your old baseball glove from the
family garage sale.)
Feel free to gloat — if someone else is nearby, ask her to pat you on the back
and call you a lifesaver.
Renaming Your Items
You wouldn’t get far in today’s spacious virtual world without being able to
change a moniker for a file or folder. To rename an item in Mac OS X, use one
of these two methods:
✦With the mouse: Click once on an icon’s name (or just press Return).
Mac OS X highlights the text in an edit box — type the new name and
then press Return when you’re done.

Book I
Chapter 3

Displaying the Facts on Files and Folders
57
You want to wait a few seconds between clicks, as opposed to a rapid-
fire double-click.
✦From the Info dialog: Select the item and press Ô+I to display the Info
dialog; then click the triangle next to Name & Extension. Click in the
name field, drag the mouse to highlight the text that you want to change,
and type the replacement text.
Naturally, the first method is the easiest, and it’s the one that I use most
often.
Adding a Dash of Color
Leopard also provides the ability to color-code files and folders to help you
organize and recognize your data in a hurry. For example, why not assign the
green label color to the files and folders that make up your current project?
Or, if you need to mark a file for immediate attention, assign it the red label
color.
To assign a label color to selected files and folders, you have three options:
✦Click the Action button on the Finder toolbar and then click the desired
color.
✦Hold down Control while you click the selection and then choose the
color from the pop-up menu. (Remember, if you have a Mighty Mouse, or
a third-party mouse with a right button, right-clicking performs the same
function as Control-clicking.)
✦Click File and choose that perfect shade from the menu.
Displaying the Facts on Files and Folders
The Finder’s Info dialog is the place to view the specifics on any highlighted
item (including drives and aliases). Select an item and press Ô+I, click the
Action toolbar button and then select Get Info from the menu, or choose the
Finder’s File menu and then choose Get Info (see the results in Figure 3-3). If
you select more than one item, Leopard opens a separate Info dialog for
each item.
Mac OS X displays the General information panel when you first open the
Info dialog, but other panels are usually available (depending on the type 
of selected items). To display the other panels, click the panel that you want
to see.

Displaying the Facts on Files and Folders
58
For most types of files and folders, the Info dialog can tell you
✦Kind: What type of item it is — for example, whether it’s a file, folder,
drive, or alias
✦Open with: What program launches automatically when you open the
selected item
✦Size: The total size of the item (or items, if there are more than ten) that
you select
✦Where: The actual path on your hard drive where the item is located
✦Dates: The date when the item was created and was last modified
✦Version: The application version number
✦Ownership & Permissions: The privileges that control who can do what
to the file — more on this later in Book II, Chapter 6 — and whether a file
is locked in read-only mode
Some of this information you can change, and some can only be displayed.
To banish the Info dialog from your Desktop, click the dialog’s Close button.
You can hide or display various parts of the Info dialog by clicking the trian-
gles next to each section heading.
For the rest of this section, I describe a number of tasks that you can accom-
plish from the Info dialog.

If you use a specific document over and over as a basis for different revi-
sions, you can enable the Stationery Pad check box on the General informa-
tion panel to use the file as stationery. Opening a stationery file automatically
creates a new, untitled version of the file in the linked application; this can
save you steps compared with duplicating the file or using the Save As pro-
cedure that I show you in Book I, Chapter 2.
Adding Spotlight comments
Mac OS X provides you with a Spotlight Comments field where you can add
additional text that’s stored along with the file (and can be matched with
Spotlight). I use this feature to record the version number of manuscript
chapters and programs that I create during the course of writing books.
To add a comment, follow these steps:
1. Display the Info dialog for the item by pressing Ô+I or choosing File➪
Get Info.
2. Click in the Spotlight Comments box and type the comment text.
If you need to expand the Spotlight Comments section of the Info dialog,
click the triangle next to the Spotlight Comments heading. The arrow
rotates and the Spotlight Comments box appears.
3. Close the Info dialog to save the comment.
Displaying extensions
Extensions are alien creatures to most Mac owners. However, these three- or
four-character add-ons that follow a period at the end of a filename have
been a mainstay in the DOS, Windows, and UNIX environments for years. An
extension identifies what program owns a specific file, and therefore which
application launches automatically when you double-click that file’s icon.
Examples of common extensions (and the applications that own them)
include
✦.pdf: Preview, or Adobe Acrobat
✦.doc: Microsoft Word
✦.pages: Apple Pages
✦.key: Apple Keynote
✦.psd: Adobe Photoshop
✦.jpeg or .jpg: Preview, or your image editor
✦.tiff or .tif: Preview, or your image editor
✦.htm or .html: Safari, or your Web browser of choice

Displaying the Facts on Files and Folders

Why would someone want to see a file’s extension? It comes in handy when a
number of different types of files are linked to the same application. For
example, if you install Adobe Photoshop, both JPEG and TIFF images have
virtually the same icon, so it’s sometimes very hard to tell one from the
other. With extensions displayed, it’s easy to tell what type of file you’re
looking at.
Follow this procedure to hide or display extensions with your filenames:
1. Display the Info dialog for the item by pressing Ô+I or choosing
File➪Get Info.
2. If you need to expand the Name & Extension section of the Info
dialog, click the triangle next to the Name & Extension heading.
3. To display the extension for the selected file, clear the Hide Extension
check box to disable it.
4. Close the Info dialog to save your changes.
Choosing the application with which to launch a file
So what’s the plan if the wrong application launches when you double-click a
file? Not a problem: You can also change the linked application from the Info
dialog as well. (I told you this was a handy toybox, didn’t I?) Follow these
steps to choose another application to pair with a selected file:
1. Click the Action button on the Finder toolbar and click Get Info to dis-
play the Info dialog for the item.
2. Click the triangle next to the Open With heading to expand it.
3. Click the pop-up menu button, and Mac OS X displays the applications
that it feels are best suited to open this type of document.
4. Select the application that should open the file.
To go completely hog-wild and choose a different application, select
Other from the pop-up menu. Mac OS X opens a Choose Other Application
dialog where you can navigate to and select the application you want. (If
the application isn’t recognized as recommended, click the Enable pop-
up menu and choose All Applications.) After you highlight the applica-
tion, click Add.
5. To globally update all the documents of the same type to launch the
application that you chose, click the Change All button.
Mac OS X displays a confirmation dialog asking whether you’re sure
about making this drastic change. Click Continue to update the other
files of the same type or click Cancel to return to the Info dialog.
6. Close the Info dialog to save your changes.

Locking files against evildoers
“Holy Item Insurance, Batman!” That’s right, Boy Wonder: Before I leave the
friendly land of the Info dialog, every Mac owner needs to know how to pro-
tect files and folders from accidental deletion or editing. By locking a file,
you allow it to be opened and copied — but not changed, renamed, or sent
to the Trash. Locked items appear in the Finder with a small padlock
attached to the icon.
To lock or unlock a file, you have to have ownership of the file. I cover privi-
leges in Book II, but on a Mac where you’ve configured only one administra-
tor account, you should already have ownership.
If you’re considering changing the ownership of a system-owned file, don’t do
it. You could throw a serious monkey wrench into your Leopard system.
To lock a file, follow this procedure:
1. Display the Info dialog for the item.
2. Select the Locked check box to enable it.
The Locked check box is in the General section of the dialog.
3. Close the Info dialog to save your changes.
Creating an Alias
I mention aliases in Book I, Chapter 2. As I discuss in that chapter, an alias
acts as a link to an application or document that actually exists elsewhere on
your system (a handy trick to use when organizing items on your hard drive).
You have a number of different ways to conjure an alias after you select an
item:
✦Choose File from the Finder menu and choose the Make Alias menu item.
(You have to move the alias yourself.)
✦Press the Ô+L keyboard shortcut. (Again, you have to move the new
alias to its new location.)
✦Click the Action button on the Finder toolbar and then click Make Alias.
✦Hold down Control while clicking the selected item and then choose
Make Alias from the contextual menu that appears.
In addition, you can hold down the Ô+Option key combination and drag the
item to the location where you want the alias.

Using the Apple Menu
62
Although Mac OS X does a great job in tracking the movements of an original
and updating an alias, some actions can break the link. For example, if you
delete the original, the alias is left wandering in search of a home. However,
all is not lost — when you double-click a broken alias, Mac OS X offers to
help you fix the alias. This involves browsing through your system to locate
a new original.
Using the Apple Menu
The Apple menu is a familiar sight to any Mac owner. Although Apple con-
templated removing it during the original development and beta cycle for
Mac OS X version 10.0, the ruckus and cry from beta-testers ensured that it
remains today. It’s amazing how reassuring that little fellow can be when you
boot the Big X for the first time.
In this section, I cover the important things that are parked under the Apple
menu.
Using Recent Items
If you’re like most of us — and I think I’m safe in assuming that you are —
you tend to work on the same set of applications and files (and use the same
network servers) during the day. Normally, this would be somewhat of a pain
because each time you sit down in front of the keyboard, you have to drill
down through at least one layer of folders to actually reach the stuff that you
need. To make things easier on yourself, you could create a set of aliases on
your Desktop that link to those servers, files, and applications . . . but as you
move from project to project, you’d find yourself constantly updating the
aliases. As Blackbeard the Pirate was wont to exclaim, “Arrgh!”
Ah, but Mac OS X is a right-smart operating system, and several years ago,
Apple created the Recent Items menu to save you the trouble of drilling for
applications and files (and even network servers as well). Figure 3-4 illus-
trates the Recent Items menu from my system. Note that the menu is
thoughtfully divided into Applications, Documents, and Servers. When you
open documents or launch applications, they’re added to the list.
(Accountants will revel in this First In, First Out technology.) To launch an
application or document from the Recent Items menu — or connect to a net-
work server — just click it.
To wipe the contents of the Recent Items menu — for example, if you’ve just
finished a project, and you want to turn over a new digital leaf — click
Recent Items and choose the Clear Menu item.

You can specify the number of recent items that will appear in the menu
from System Preferences; display the Appearance icon and click the
Applications, Documents, and Servers list boxes in the Number of Recent
Items field. (More on this in Book II, Chapter 3.)
Also, remember the trick that I mention earlier: You can drag any folder or
server into the Sidebar column at the left of a Finder window, adding it to
that exclusive club that includes your Home folder, Applications folder, and
media folders.
Playing with the Dock
You know how Air Force One acts as the mobile nerve center for the
President? And how The Chief can jet all around the world and take all his
stuff along with him? Well, the Dock is kind of like that. Sort of.
If you want your Dock to go mobile as well, click the Apple menu and choose
the Dock item to display the submenu. Here’s a rundown of the options that
you’ll find:
✦Hiding: Click Turn Hiding On/Off to toggle the automatic hiding of the
Dock. With hiding on, the Dock disappears off the edge of the screen
until you move the mouse pointer to that edge. (This is great for those

who want to make use of as much Desktop territory as possible for their
applications.)
You can press Ô+Option+D to toggle Dock hiding on and off from the
keyboard.
✦Magnification: Click Turn Magnification On/Off to toggle icon magnifica-
tion when your pointer is selecting an icon from the Dock. With magnifi-
cation on, the icons in the Dock get really, really big . . . a good thing for
Mr. Magoo or those with grandiose schemes to take over the world.
Check out the rather oversized icons in Figure 3-5. (The amount of mag-
nification can be controlled from the System Preferences Dock settings,
which I explain in Book II, Chapter 3.)
✦Position: Click one of three choices (Position on Left, Bottom, or Right)
to make the Dock appear on the left, bottom, or right of the screen,
respectively.
✦Dock Preferences: Click this to display the System Preferences Dock set-
tings, which I explain in Book II, Chapter 3.

Bad program! Quit!
Once in a while, you’ll encounter a stubborn application that locks up, slows
to a crawl, or gets stuck in an endless loop — although Mac OS X is a highly
advanced operating system, it can still fall prey to bad programming or cor-
rupted data.
Luckily, you can easily shut down these troublemakers from the Apple menu.
Just choose Force Quit to display the Force Quit Applications dialog that you
see in Figure 3-6. (Keyboard types can press Ô+Option+Esc.) Select the
application that you want to banish and then click the Force Quit button;
Mac OS X requests confirmation, after which you click the Force Quit button
again.
If you select Finder in the Force Quit Applications dialog, the button changes
to Relaunch. This allows you to restart the Finder, which comes in handy if
your system appears to be unstable. (This is much faster than actually
restarting your Mac.)
Forcing an application to quit will also quit any open documents that you
were working with in that application, so save your work (if the program will
allow you to save anything). If you relaunch the Finder, some programs
might restart as well.
Tracking down your version
This isn’t a big deal, but if you choose About This Mac from the Apple menu,
Mac OS X displays the About This Mac dialog that you see in Figure 3-7. In
case you need to check the amount of memory or the processor in an unfa-
miliar Mac, the About This Mac dialog can display these facts in a twinkling.
However, I primarily use it to check the Mac OS X version and build number
as well as to launch the Apple System Profiler (which I discuss in full in
Chapter 7 of this mini-book). Click the More Info button to launch the Profiler.

Availing Yourself of Mac OS X Services
66
Apple includes a button that launches Software Update to both the About
This Mac dialog and the Apple menu . . . sheesh, they must really want you
to keep your Big X up to date, I guess.
Specifying a location
Mac OS X allows you to create multiple network locations — think of a loca-
tion as a separate configuration that you use when you connect to a different
network from a different locale. For instance, if you travel to a branch office,
you’d assign a location for your desk and a location for the remote branch. A
student might assign one location for her home network and another for the
college computer lab network.
A location saves all the specific values that you’ve entered in the System
Preferences Network settings, including IP address, AppleTalk Zones, proxy
servers, and the like. If all this means diddly squat to you, don’t worry — I
explain this in Book V, Chapter 1. For now, just remember that you can switch
between locations by choosing Location from the Apple menu, which dis-
plays a submenu of locations that you can choose from.
Availing Yourself of Mac OS X Services
In Mac OS X, Services allow you to merge information from one application
with another. To Mac old-timers, that might sound suspiciously like the
Clipboard; however, Services can also include functionality from an applica-
tion, so you can create new documents or complete tasks without running
another program! Services can be used in both the Finder and Mac OS X
applications.

Get Thee Hence: Using the Go Menu
67
To illustrate, here’s a fun example:
1. Launch TextEdit (you’ll find it in your Applications folder) and type
these words: Hello from your Macintosh!
2. Highlight those words.
3. Click the TextEdit menu — don’t switch to the Finder, use the TextEdit
Application menu — and choose Services.
4. From the Services submenu, choose Speech and then choose Start
Speaking Text.
After you’ve chuckled a bit at your Mac’s accent, consider what you just 
did — you ran the Speech application from within TextEdit, using the
selected words! Pretty slick, eh?
A glance at the other Services that show up from within most applications
gives you an idea of just how convenient and powerful Mac OS X Services
can be — I often use Services to take care of things like
✦Sending an e-mail message from an e-mail address in a text file,
AppleScript document, or the Address Book (via the Mail Service)
✦Capturing a screen snapshot within an application (using the Grab
Service)
✦Sending a file to a Bluetooth-equipped PDA or cell phone within an appli-
cation (using the Send File to Bluetooth Device service)
Remember, you can access the Services menu from a Mac OS X application
by picking that program’s Application menu (sometimes called the named
menu). For instance, in the demonstration earlier, I use the TextEdit menu
that appears on the TextEdit menu bar. In Microsoft Word, I would click the
Word menu.
Geez, I think the computing world needs another word for menu — don’t you?
Many third-party applications that you install under Mac OS X can add their
own commands under the Services menu, so be sure to read the documenta-
tion for a new application to see what Service functionality it adds.
Get Thee Hence: Using the Go Menu
Remember the transporter from Star Trek? Step on the little platform,
assume a brave pose, and whoosh! — you’re transported instantaneously to

thing didn’t malfunction.

The Finder’s Go menu gives you the chance to play Captain Kirk: You can
jump immediately to specific spots, both within the confines of your own

(You can leave your phaser and tricorder in your cabin.)
The destinations that you can travel to using the Go menu and the iDisk sub-
menu include the following:
✦Back/Forward/Enclosing Folder: I lump these three commands together
because they’re all basic navigation commands. For example, Back and
Forward operate just like they do in Safari or your favorite Web browser.
If you’re currently inside a folder, you can return to the parent folder by
clicking Enclosing Folder.
✦Computer: This window includes your hard drives, CD and DVD drives,
and your network — the same places that appear when you open a new
Finder window with the Ô+N key shortcut.
✦Home: This window displays the home directory for the user currently
logged in.
✦Desktop: This window displays the files and folders that you’ve stored
on your Leopard desktop.
✦Network: Did you guess this displays a window with all of your network
connections? Dead giveaway, that.
✦iDisk: This window displays the contents of your Internet iDisk storage
(or someone else’s). (More on the coolness that is iDisk in Book IV,
Chapter 4.)
✦Applications: This window includes all the applications that appear in
your Mac OS X Applications folder (a neat Just the programs, ma’am
arrangement that really comes in handy).
✦Utilities: This window displays all the utilities in your Mac OS X Utilities
folder.
✦Recent Folders: This window displays a submenu that allows you to
choose from the folders that you’ve recently opened.
You can also type the path for a specific folder (use the Go to Folder com-
mand) or connect to a specific network server (use the Connect to Server
command).
Note that most of the Go menu commands include keyboard shortcuts, prov-
ing once again that the fingers are quicker than the mouse.

Monkeying with the Menu Bar

Monkeying with the Menu Bar
Ever stared at a menu bar for inspiration? Fortunately for Mac owners like
you and me, people in Cupertino are paid to do just that, and these design-
ers get the big bucks to make the Mac OS X menu bar the best that it can be.
Thus were born menu bar icons, which add useful controls in what would
otherwise be a wasted expanse of white.
Using menu bar icons
Depending on your hardware, Mac OS X might install several menu bar
icons. The Volume icon is always there by default, along with the Clock dis-
play, which is actually an icon in disguise. Figure 3-8 illustrates these stan-
dard icons, along with a couple of others.
Some icons won’t appear unless you turn them on. For instance, the Displays
icon won’t appear unless you enable the Show Displays in Menu Bar check
box within the Displays pane in System Preferences. The Displays menu bar
icon, which looks like a monitor, allows you to choose from the recom-
mended resolutions and color depth settings for your graphics card and
monitor. For example, the recommended settings for my MacBook Pro,
which has an LCD monitor, includes 1024 x 768, 1280 x 800, or 1440 x 900 
resolutions, and my display can be set to thousands or millions of colors.
Typically, it’s a good idea to choose the highest resolution and the highest
color depth. You can also jump directly to the System Preferences Display
settings by clicking Displays Preferences in the menu.
To quickly change the audio volume level within Mac OS X, click the Volume
icon (it looks like a speaker with emanating sound waves) once to display its
slider control; then click and drag the slider to adjust the level up or down.
After you select a level by releasing the mouse button, your Mac thought-
fully plays the default system sound to help you gauge the new volume level.
Depending on the functionality that you’re using with Mac OS X, these other
menu bar icons might also appear:
✦Modem status: You can turn on the display of the Modem status icon
from the corresponding modem panel of the Internet Connect applica-
tion, which I discuss in Book IV, Chapter 1. Click this icon to connect to
or disconnect from the Internet by using a modem. You can open the
Internet Connect application from the menu bar icon, and the icon can
be set to show the time that you’ve been connected to the Internet as
well as the status of the connection procedure.

Monkeying with the Menu Bar
70
✦AirPort: If your Mac is equipped with an AirPort or AirPort Extreme
card, you can check the status of the AirPort connection; click the
AirPort icon to toggle AirPort on or off. The icon displays the relative
strength of your AirPort signal, whether you’re connected to a Base
Station or a peer-to-peer computer network, or whether AirPort is
turned off. You can also switch between multiple AirPort networks from
the menu.
✦Bluetooth: For those Macs with Bluetooth hardware, you can toggle
Bluetooth networking on or off. You can also make your Mac discover-
able or hidden to other Bluetooth devices, send a file to a Bluetooth
device, or browse for new Bluetooth devices in your vicinity. You can
also set up a Bluetooth device that’s already recognized or open the
Bluetooth pane within System Preferences.
✦PPoE: The display of this icon is controlled from the Ethernet panel of
the Internet Connect application. Click this icon to connect to or discon-
nect from the Internet using Point-to-Point over Ethernet (PPoE), which is
a type of Internet connection offered by some digital subscriber line
(DSL) providers.

Doing timely things with the Clock
Even the Clock itself isn’t static eye candy on the Mac OS X menu bar — I
told you this was a hardworking operating system, didn’t I? Click the Clock
display to toggle the icon between the default text display and a miniature
analog clock.
You can also open the System Preferences Date & Time settings from the
icon. From within the Date & Time settings, you can choose whether the sec-
onds or day of the week are included, whether the separators should flash,
or whether Mac OS X should display the time in 24-hour (military) format.
More on this in Book II, Chapter 3.
Eject, Tex, Eject!
Mac OS X makes use of both static volumes (your Mac’s hard drive, which
remains mummified inside your computer’s case) and removable volumes
(like USB Flash drives, your iPod, and CDs/DVD-ROMs). Mac OS X calls the
process of loading and unloading a removable volume by old-fashioned
terms — mounting and unmounting — but you and I call the procedure load-
ing and ejecting.
Mark’s totally unnecessary Computer Trivia 1.0
“Where the heck did mounting come from,
anyway? Sounds like a line from a John Wayne
Western!” Well, pardner, the term dates back
to the heyday of Big Iron — the Mainframe
Age, when giant IBM dinosaurs populated the
computing world. Sherman, set the WayBack
Machine . . . .
At the time, disks were big, heavy, removable
cartridges the diameter of dinner plates (and
about as tall as a 100-count spindle of CD-Rs).
The acolytes of the mainframe, called computer
operators, would have to trudge over to a cab-
inet and swap disk cartridges whenever the
program stopped and asked for them — that’s
right, those mainframes would actually stop
calculating and print, “I need you to mount car-
tridge 12-A-34, or I can’t go any further. Have a
nice day.” (Can you imagine what it’d be like
loading and unloading a hard drive every time
you needed to open a folder?)
Anyway, even though eons passed and mini-
computers appeared — which were only the
size of a washing machine — the terms mount-
ing and unmounting still commonly appeared in
programs. This time, the removable volumes
were 8-inch floppy disks and tape cartridges.
Because UNIX and its offspring Linux date from
the Minicomputer Age, these operating sys-
tems still use the terms.

Common Tasks Aplenty
72
I won’t discuss loading/mounting a removable volume — the process differs
depending on the computer because some Macs need a button pushed on
the keyboard, others have buttons on the drive itself, and some drives have
just a slot, with no button at all. However, there are a number of standard
ways of unloading/unmounting/ejecting a removable volume:
✦Drag the Volume icon from the Desktop to the Trash, which displays an
Eject pop-up label to help underline the fact that you are not deleting the
contents of the drive. Let me underline that with a Mark’s Maxim because
Switchers from the Windows world are usually scared to death by the
concept of dragging a volume to the Trash.
Have no fear — in the Apple universe, you can drag removable volumes
to the Trash with aplomb.
✦Click the Volume icon and use the Ô+E keyboard shortcut.
✦With the volume open in a Finder window, click the Action button and
choose Eject from the pop-up menu.
✦Click the File menu and choose Eject.
✦Click the Eject button next to the device in the Finder window sidebar.
✦Hold down Control and click the Volume icon to display the contex-
tual menu; then choose Eject.
✦Press your keyboard Eject key (if it has one) to eject a CD or DVD from
your built-in optical drive. (If you’re using a keyboard without a
Media Eject key, press and hold F12 instead.)
You can’t unmount a static volume from the Desktop — you have to use the
Disk Utility application — so your internal hard drive icon will stay where it is.
Common Tasks Aplenty
Okay, I admit it — this section is kind of a grab bag of three very common
tasks. However, I want to walk you through these three procedures early in
the book. Most Mac owners will want to listen to and record CDs as soon as
Mac OS X is installed, and you’d be amazed how much information still flows
across the Internet in plain, simple text.
Therefore, hang around and take care of business.
Opening and editing text files
Text files would seem to be another anachronism in this age of formatted
Web pages, rich text format (RTF) documents, and word processors galore.

Common Tasks Aplenty
73
However, virtually every computer ever built can read and write in standard
text, so text files are often used for
✦Information files on the Internet, like FAQs (Frequently Asked Question
files)
✦README and update information by software developers
✦Swapping data between programs, like comma-delimited database files
Here’s the quick skinny on opening, editing, and saving an existing text file:
1. Navigate to your Applications folder and launch TextEdit.
2. Press Ô+O to display the Open dialog.
3. Navigate to the desired text file and double-click the filename to load it.
You can also open an existing text file by dragging its icon from the
Finder window to the TextEdit icon.
4. Click the insertion cursor anywhere in the file and begin typing. Or,
to edit existing text, drag the insertion cursor across the characters to
highlight them and type the replacement text.
TextEdit automatically replaces the existing characters with those that
you type. To simply delete text, highlight the characters and press
Delete.
5. After you finish editing the document, you can overwrite the original
by pressing Ô+S (which is the same as choosing File➪Save), or you
can save a new version by choosing File➪Save As and typing a new,
unique filename.
6. To exit TextEdit, press Ô+Q.
Listening to an audio CD
By default, Mac OS X uses iTunes to play an audio CD. Although I cover
iTunes in complete detail in Book III, Chapter 2, take a moment to see how to
master the common task of playing an audio CD (just in case you want to
jam while reading these early chapters). Follow these steps:
1. Load the audio CD into your Mac’s CD-ROM/DVD-ROM drive.
An Audio CD volume icon appears on your Desktop.
2. Mac OS X automatically loads iTunes and displays its spiffy window.
3. By default, iTunes automatically begins playing the disc — however, 
if you have to manually start the music, click the Play button at the
upper left of the iTunes window to begin playing the disc at the begin-
ning. To play an individual track, double-click the track name in the
iTunes window.

Common Tasks Aplenty
74
4. To adjust the volume from within iTunes, drag the Volume slider to the
left or right — it’s to the right of the Play and Fast Forward buttons.
5. To eject the disc and load another audio CD, click the Eject CD button
at the lower right of the iTunes window.
6. To exit iTunes, press Ô+Q.
The first time that you run iTunes, you’re asked to configure the program
and specify whether Mac OS X should automatically connect to the Internet
to download the track titles for the disc you’ve loaded. I recommend that
you accept all the default settings and that you allow automatic connection.
Is simple, no?
Recording — nay, burning — a data CD
Mac OS X offers a built-in CD recording feature that allows you to burn the
simplest form of CD: a standard data CD-ROM that can hold up to approxi-
mately 660MB of files and folders, and can be read on both Macs and PCs
running Windows, UNIX, and Linux. (To burn an audio CD, use iTunes, as I
show you in Book III, Chapter 2.) Naturally, you’ll need a Mac with a CD or
DVD recorder.
If you’re interested in recording all the exotic CD and DVD formats available
today, I can heartily recommend the best book on CD and DVD recording 
on the shelves: CD & DVD Recording For Dummies, 2nd Edition, written by
(surprise!) yours truly (Wiley). CD & DVD Recording For Dummies is a com-
prehensive recording guide that shows you how to burn all types of audio,
Adding the perfect font with Font Book
Need to install a font in Mac OS X, or perhaps
you’d like to organize your fonts into collections
based on their theme or their designer? If so,
you’re talking about Font Book, which is the
font organizer that ships with Leopard. To open
Font Book, visit your Applications folder and
double-click the Font Book icon.
Press Ô+O (or choose File➪Add Fonts) to
import a new font into your system, or simply
drag the font file from a Finder window into the
Font Book window. Leopard can accept both
TrueType and OpenType PostScript fonts. When
it’s been added, your new font can be catego-
rized by dragging it into one of your collections,
thus making that font easier to locate and dis-
play. Individual fonts and entire collections can
be enabled or disabled (by using the plus and
Disable buttons at the bottom of the Font Book
window), so that you can “turn on” only those
fonts that you need for a specific application or
project. The Font Book window also comes fully
equipped with a Search box, so you can find
any font by name.

read.
Back to the story! To record a disc, follow these steps:
1. Load a blank CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, or DVD-RW into your drive.
I assume for this demonstration that you’re using a write-once CD-R.
2. A dialog appears and prompts you for an action to take. The default,
Open Finder, is the proper choice for this demonstration.
Mac OS X displays an Untitled CD volume icon on your Desktop. (It’s
marked with the letters CDR so you know that the disc is recordable.)
3. Double-click the Untitled CD icon to display the contents — it’ll be
empty, naturally.
4. Click and drag files and folders to the CD window as you normally do.
5. Rename any files or folders as necessary — remember, after you’ve
started recording, this stuff is etched in stone, so your disc window
should look just like the volume window should look on the finished
CD-ROM.
6. Click File on the Finder menu and choose Burn Disc, or click the Burn
button in the CD window.
7. The Big X displays a confirmation dialog. If you’ve forgotten some-
thing, you can click the Cancel or Eject button.
Otherwise, click the Burn button and sit back and watch the fun.
Unfortunately, Mac OS X doesn’t support recording from the Finder for many
of the external and third-party drives available for the Macintosh. If you
can’t burn from the Finder, I recommend that you buy a copy of Roxio Toast
Titanium recording software (www.roxio.com).
All You Really Need to Know about Printing
To close out this chapter, I turn the attention to another task that most Mac
owners need to tackle soon after installing Mac OS X: printing documents.
Because basic printing is so important (and in most cases, so simple), allow
me to use this final section to demonstrate how to print a document.
Most of us have a Universal Serial Bus (USB) printer — the USB being the
favored hardware connection within Mac OS X — so as long as your printer
is supported by Mac OS X, setting it up is as easy as plugging it into one of
your Mac’s USB ports. The Big X does the rest of the work, selecting the
proper printer software driver from the Library/Printers folder and setting
your printer as the default power of the universe.

All You Really Need to Know about Printing
76
Before you print, preview! Would you jump from an airplane without a para-
chute? Then why would you print a document without double-checking it
first? Click Preview, and Mac OS X opens the Preview application to show
you what the printed document will look like. (Once again, some upstart pro-
grams have their own built-in Print Preview mode.) When you’re done exam-
ining your handiwork, close the Preview application to return to your
document.
To print from within any application using the default page characteristics —
standard 81⁄2-x-11 inch paper, portrait mode, no scaling — follow these steps:
1. Within your application, click File and choose Print — or press the
Ô+P keyboard shortcut.
2. Mac OS X displays the simple version of the Print dialog. (To display
all the fields that you see in Figure 3-9, click the button with the Down
arrow next to the Printer pop-up menu.)
Some applications use their own custom Print dialogs, but you should
see the same general settings.
3. Click in the Copies field and enter the number of copies that you
need.
You can also enable or disable collation, just like those oh-so-fancy
copiers.

4. Decide what you want to print.
• The whole shootin’ match: To print the entire document, use the
default Pages radio button setting of All.
• Anything less: To print a range of selected pages, select the From
radio button and enter the starting and ending pages.
5. (Optional) Choose application-specific printing parameters.
Each Mac OS X application provides different panes so that you can con-
figure settings specific to that application. You don’t have to display any
of these extra settings to print a default document, but the power is
there to change the look dramatically when necessary. To display these
settings, click the pop-up menu in the center of the Print dialog and
choose one of these panes. For example, if you’re printing from the
Address Book, you can choose the Address Book entry from the pop-up
menu and elect to print a phone list or an e-mail list.
6. When everything is go for launch, click the Print button.
Of course, there are more settings and more functionality to the printing
system within Mac OS X, and I cover more complex printing topics in much
more detail in Book VI, Chapter 4 — however, I can tell you from my experi-
ences as a consultant and hardware technician that this short introduction
to printing will likely suffice for 90 percent of the Mac owners on earth. ’Nuff
said.

S
potlight is Apple’s desktop search technology that you can use to find
anything on your computer as quickly as you can type. (Yep, that
includes all the documents, Address Book contacts, Mail messages, folders,
and drives that your Mac can access.) In fact, the new version of Spotlight
included with Leopard can even search other Macs across your network!
Yes, you read right: For the first time, if the information is on a Mac’s hard
drive, a CD, your network, or even another Mac in your network, consider it
located.
This chapter is your ticket to using this new search technology like a profes-
sional techno-wizard from day one. I discuss how Spotlight works and how
you can use it to locate exactly what you want (and present those results,
like a wine steward shows off a fine vintage).
Basic Searching 101
Figure 4-1 illustrates the Spotlight search field, which is always available
from the Finder menu bar. Click the magnifying glass icon once, and the
Spotlight search box appears.
To run a search, simply click in the Spotlight box and begin typing. You see
matching items appear as soon as you type, and the search results are con-
tinually refined while you type the rest of your search criteria. Like the
Search box in earlier Finder window toolbars, you don’t need to press
Return to begin the search.

Basic Searching 101
80
The results of your Spotlight search are presented in the Spotlight menu,
which is updated automatically in real time while you continue to type. The
top 20 most-relevant items are grouped into categories right on the Spotlight
menu, including Messages, Definition, Documents, Folders, Images, Contacts,
and so on. Spotlight takes a guess at the item that’s most likely the match
you’re looking for and presents it in the special Top Hit category that always
appears first.
To open the Top Hit item like a true Leopard power user, just press Return.
(My brothers and sisters, it just doesn’t get any easier than that.)
Literally any text string is acceptable as a Spotlight search. However, here’s a
short list of the common search criteria I use every day:
✦Names and addresses: Because Spotlight has access to Leopard’s
Address Book, you can immediately display contact information using
any portion of a name or address.
✦E-mail message text: Need to open a specific e-mail message, but you’d
rather not launch Mail and spend time digging through the message list?
Enter the person’s e-mail address or any text string contained in the
message you’re looking for.
✦File and folder names: This is the classic search favorite. Spotlight
searches your entire system for that one file or folder in the blink of 
an eye.
✦Events & To Do items: Yep, Spotlight gives you access to your iCal cal-
endars and those all-important To Do lists you’ve created.
✦System Preferences: Now things start to get really interesting! Try
typing the word background in the Spotlight field. Some of the results
will actually be System Preference panes! That’s right, every setting in
System Preferences is referenced in Spotlight. (For example, the Software
Update pane contains the word background while the desktop back-
ground setting is on the Desktop & Screen Saver pane in System
Preferences.)
Figure 4-1:

Chapter 4

Everything

Is Spotlight Really That Cool?
81
✦Web pages: Whoa. Stand back, Google, you can now use Spotlight to
search the Web pages you’ve recently displayed in Safari! (Note, how-
ever, that this new feature doesn’t let you search through all the Internet
like Google does . . . only the pages stored in your Safari Web cache.)
✦Metadata: That’s a pretty broad category, but it fits. For example, I like
to locate Word documents on my system using the same metadata that’s
stored in the file, such as the contents of the Comments field in a Word
document. Other supported applications include Photoshop images,
Excel spreadsheets, Keynote presentations, and other third-party appli-
cations that offer a Spotlight plug-in.
To reset the Spotlight search and try another text string, click the X icon that
appears at the right side of the Spotlight box. (Of course, you can also back-
space to the beginning of the field, but that’s a little less elegant.)
After you find the item that you’re looking for, you can click it once to
✦Launch it (if the item is an application)
✦Open it in System Preferences (if it’s a setting or description on a
Preferences pane)
✦Open it within the associated application (if the item is a document or a
data item)
✦Display it within a Finder window (if the item is a folder)
Here’s another favorite timesaver: You can display all the files of a particular
type on your system by using the file type as the keyword. For example, 
to provide a list of all images on your system, just use images as your 
keyword — the same goes for movies and audio, too.
In fact, you can display the same search results from the new Leopard
Sidebar, which now includes a Search For heading! You can display All
Images, All Movies, and All Documents with a single click of your mouse
button, from any Finder window.
Is Spotlight Really That Cool?
Don’t get fooled into simply using Spotlight as another file-’n-folder-name
search tool. Sure, it can do that, but Spotlight can also search inside PDF and
HTML files, finding matching text that doesn’t appear in the name of the file!
To wit: A search for Leopard on my system pulls up all sorts of items with
Leopard in their names, but also files with Leopard in them:

Is Spotlight Really That Cool?
82
✦Apple Store SF.ppt: A PowerPoint presentation that contains several
slides containing the text Leopard
✦bk01ch03.doc: A rather cryptically named Word file chapter of this book
that mentions Leopard in several spots
✦Conference Call with Bob: An iCal event pointing to a conference call with
my editor about upcoming Leopard book projects
Notice that not one of these three examples actually has the word Leopard
occurring anywhere in the title or filename, yet Spotlight found them because
they all contain the text Leopard therein. That, dear reader, is the true power
of Spotlight, and how it can literally guarantee you that you’ll never lose
another piece of information in the hundreds of thousands of files and fold-
ers on your hard drive!
Heck, suppose that all you remember about a file is that you received it in
your mail last week or last month. To find it, you can actually type in time
periods, like yesterday, last week, or last month, to see every item that you
saved or received within that period. (Boy, howdy, I love writing about truly
good ideas.)
Again, the new Leopard Sidebar also allows you to search for files by time
period, using the links under the Search For heading.
Be careful, however, when you’re considering a search string. Don’t forget
that (by default) Spotlight matches only those items that have all the words
Is Spotlight secure?
So how about all those files, folders, contacts,
and events that you don’t want to appear in
Spotlight? What if you’re sharing your Mac as a
multi-user computer, or accessing other Macs
remotely? Can others search for and access
your personal information through Spotlight?
Definitely not! The results displayed by Spotlight
are controlled by file and folder permissions as
well as your account login, just like the applica-
tions that create and display your personal data.
For example, you can’t access other users’ cal-
endars using iCal, and they can’t see your Mail
messages — only you have access to your data,
and only after you’ve logged in with your user-
name and password. Spotlight works the same
way. If a user doesn’t normally have access to
an item, it simply doesn’t appear when that user
performs a Spotlight search. (In other words,
only you get to see your stuff.)
However, you can even hide certain folders and
disks from your own Spotlight searches if nec-
essary. Check out the last section of this chap-
ter for details on setting private locations on
your system.

you enter in the Spotlight box. To return the highest number of possible
matches, use the fewest number of words that will identify the item; for
example, use horse rather than horse image, and you’re certain to be
rewarded with more hits. (On the other hand, if you’re looking specifically
for a picture of a knight on horseback, a series of keywords, like horse knight
image, shortens your search considerably. It all depends on what you’re
looking for, and how widely you want to cast your Spotlight net.)
To allow greater flexibility in searches, Apple has added those helpful
Boolean friends that you may already be familiar with: AND, OR, and NOT. For
example, you can now perform Spotlight searches, like
✦Horse AND cow (which collects all references to both those barnyard ani-
mals into one search)
✦Batman OR Robin (which returns all references to either Batman or
Robin, but not both)
✦Apple NOT PC (which displays all references to Apple that don’t include
any information on dastardly PCs)
Because Spotlight functions are a core technology of Mac OS X Leopard — in
other words, all sorts of applications can make use of Spotlight throughout
the operating system, including the Finder — the Finder window’s Search
box now shares many of the capabilities of Spotlight. In fact, you can use the
time period trick that I mention earlier (entering yesterday as a keyword) in
the Finder window Search box.
Okay, parents, listen closely: Here’s a (somewhat sneaky) tip that might help
you monitor your kid’s computer time as well as what your kids are typing/
reading in iChat:
1. Enable the iChat transcript feature.
a. From within iChat, choose iChat➪Preferences.
b. Click Messages.
c. Select the Automatically Save Chat Transcripts check box and choose a
destination folder in a location you can access.
2. Click OK to return to iChat.
Now you can use Spotlight to search for questionable words, phrases,
and names within those iChat transcripts. (For more on iChat, turn to
Book IV, Chapter 3.)

Expanding Your Search Horizons
84
Expanding Your Search Horizons
I can just hear the announcer’s voice now: “But wait, there’s more! If you
click the Show All menu item at the beginning of your search results, we’ll
expand your Spotlight menu into the Spotlight Results window!” (Fortunately,
you don’t have to buy some ridiculous household doo-dad.)
Keyboard mavens will appreciate the Spotlight window shortcut key, and I
show you where to specify this shortcut in the last section of this chapter.
You can also press Return immediately after typing your search text into the
Spotlight box to automatically bring up the Results window.
Figure 4-2 illustrates the Results window (which is actually a Finder window
with extras). To further filter the search, click one of the buttons on the
Spotlight Results window toolbar or create your own custom filter. Click the
button with the plus sign to display the search criteria bar and then click the
pop-up menus to choose from criteria, like the type of file, the text content,
or the location on your system (such as your hard drive, your Home folder,
or a network server). You can also filter your results listing by the date the
items were created or last saved. To add or delete criteria, click the plus and
minus buttons at the right side of the search criteria bar. To save a custom
filter that you’ve created, click the Save button.
Images appear as thumbnails, so you can use that most sophisticated search
tool — the human eye — to find the picture you’re looking for. (If you don’t
see thumbnail images, click the Thumbnail button on the Images section
header.)

To display more information about any item in the list (without leaving the
comfortable confines of the Results window), click the Info icon (lowercase
italic i in a circle) at the right side of the entry.
Again, when you’re ready to open an item, just click it in the Results window.
As I mention earlier, Spotlight can look for matching items on other Macs on
your network — but only if those remote Macs are configured correctly. To
allow another Mac to be visible to Spotlight on your system, enable Personal
File Sharing on the other Mac. (Oh, and remember that you need an admin-
level account on that Mac — or access to a good friend who has an admin-
level account on that Mac.)
Follow these steps to enable Personal File Sharing on the other Mac:
1. Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock.
2. Click the Sharing pane.
3. Select the On check box next to the Personal File Sharing item in the
service list to enable it.
4. Click the Close button on the System Preferences window.
Remember, you can only search items that you have rights and permissions
to view on the remote Mac (such as the contents of the Public folders on
that computer). I discuss more about these limitations in the sidebar, “Is
Spotlight secure?,” earlier in this chapter.
Customizing Spotlight to Your Taste
You might wonder whether such an awesome Mac OS X feature has its own
pane within System Preferences — and you’d be right again. Figure 4-3
shows off the Spotlight pane within System Preferences: Click the System
Preferences icon (look for the light switch) on the Dock and then click the
Spotlight icon (under Personal) to display these settings.
Click the Search Results tab to
✦Determine which categories appear in the Spotlight menu and Results
window. For example, if you don’t use any presentation software on
your Mac, you can clear the check box next to Presentations to disable
this category (thereby making more room for other categories that you
will use).

Customizing Spotlight to Your Taste
86
✦Determine the order that categories appear in the Spotlight menu and
Results window. Drag the categories to the order you want them to
appear in the Spotlight menu and window. For example, I like the
Documents and System Preferences categories to appear higher in the
list because I use them most often.
✦Specify the Spotlight menu and Spotlight Results window keyboard
shortcuts. You can enable or disable either keyboard shortcut and
choose the key combination from the pop-up menu.
Click the Privacy tab (as shown in Figure 4-4) to specify disks and folders
that should never be listed as results in a Spotlight search. I know, I know, I
said earlier that Spotlight respected your security, and it does. However, the
disks and folders that you add on this list won’t appear even if you are the
one performing the search. (This is a great idea for folders and removable
hard drives that you use to store sensitive information, like medical
records.)
To add locations that you want to keep private, click the Add button (bear-
ing a plus sign) and navigate to the desired location. Click the location to
select it and then click Choose. (Alternatively, you can drag folders or disks
directly from a Finder window and drop them into the pane.)

In This Chapter
 Using Photo Booth to take photos
 Capturing video with iMovie
 Working with the Apple Remote
 Using Front Row
M
any Apple switchers and first-time owners quickly notice two rather
unusual items that accompany the latest iMacs, Mac minis, and
MacBooks: One appears to be a stick of chewing gum sporting buttons in
the box, and the other looks like a tiny square lens and LED light at the top
of the Mac screen.
First, allow me to identify these toys. The former is your Apple Remote,
which you can use to control your Mac from the comfort of your lounge
chair or breakfast nook via Leopard’s Front Row software. The latter is the
lens of your Mac’s built-in iSight camera, which allows video chatting in
iChat or a quick fun series of photos or video clips via Leopard’s Photo
Booth and iMovie applications.
What’s that you say? Your last computer didn’t have a remote control?
You’ve never used a computer video camera? Well then, good reader, you’ve
come to the right place!
In this chapter, I show you how to use your Mac’s remote to dazzle your
friends and family with all sorts of digital media; then, I demonstrate how
easy it is to produce photos and video with your iSight camera. Sassy!
Capturing the Moment with iSight and Photo Booth
Does your MacBook or iMac have that tiny lens at the top of the screen?
Then you’re in business with your built-in iSight camera . . . pat yourself on
the back and do the Technology dance.

Capturing the Moment with iSight and Photo Booth
90
If you’re using a Mac mini or Mac Pro, you’re not stuck out in the cold! You
can still add your own iSight external camera or use a FireWire DV cam-
corder for your Photo Booth input. Leopard automatically recognizes any
supported external video camera.
Figure 5-1 illustrates a typical MacBook iSight camera. With iChat, you can
videoconference in style — you’ll find everything you need to join the ranks
of the iChat elite in Book IV, Chapter 3. Photo Booth allows you to snap digi-
tal pictures just like the old automatic photo booth at your local arcade,
complete with visual effects to add pizzazz and punch to your photos.
The iSight camera’s indicator light glows green whenever you’re taking a
snapshot or recording video . . . which, when you think about it, is A Good
Thing (especially if you prefer chatting at home in Leisure Mode).
Need a quick picture of yourself for use on your Web page, or perhaps your
iChat icon needs an update to show off your new haircut? Photo Booth can
capture images at 640 x 480 resolution and 32-bit color — although today’s
digital cameras produce a much higher quality photo, you can’t beat the
built-in convenience of Photo Booth for that quick snapshot! To snap an
image in Photo Booth, follow these steps:
1. Launch Photo Booth from the dock or from the Applications folder.
Figure 5-2 illustrates the application window that appears.
2. (Optional) Click the 1 or 2 button to choose an effect you’d like to
apply to your image.

Photo Booth displays a screen of thumbnail preview images so that you
can see how each effect changes the photo. You can produce some of
the simple effects you may be familiar with from Photoshop, such as a
black-and-white image or a fancy colored pencil filter . . . but it can also
deliver some mind-blowing distortion effects, and even an Andy Warhol-
style pop-art image!
Of course, you can always launch your favorite image editor afterward
to use a filter or effect on a photo — for example, the effects available in
iPhoto — Photo Booth can apply these effects automatically as soon as
you take the picture.
3. (Optional) Click a thumbnail to select the desired effect.
To return the display to normal, click the 1 button and click the Normal
thumbnail, which appears in the center. (Paul Lynde’s spot, for those of
you old enough to remember Hollywood Squares.)
4. Click the Camera button.

You’ll notice that the image appears in the film strip at the bottom of the
window — Photo Booth keeps a copy of all the images you take in the film
strip so that you can use them later. After you click a photo in the filmstrip, a
series of buttons appear, including
✦Sending the photo in an e-mail message
✦Saving the photo directly to iPhoto
✦Using the image as your Leopard user account icon
✦Using the image as your iChat Buddy icon
To delete an image from the Photo Booth filmstrip, click the offending photo
and then click the X button that appears underneath.
Producing Video on the Spot with iMovie
“Mark, am I limited to capturing still images with my Mac’s camera?” Oh,
pshaw on limitations . . . you’re a Mac owner, after all! You can also use your
iSight camera to snag video clips (complete with audio) in iMovie.
You don’t need an expensive digital camcorder to produce video clips for
use in iMovie! Your Mac’s camera can capture those clips for you — think of
the party possibilities! (Or, the opportunity for practical jokes. But then
again, you’re not that kind of person, now are you?) To capture video
directly from your iSight camera into iMovie, follow these steps:
1. Launch iMovie from the dock or from the Applications folder.
2. Click the Import Video/Editing toggle to switch to Import Video mode.
In case you haven’t used it yet, the toggle is located under the monitor
window, and it sports a camera and scissors icons.
3. Click the Camera icon (which is just to the left of the Import
Video/Editing switch) to display the pop-up menu and click Built-in
iSight.
4. When you’re ready to start recording video, click the Record with
iSight button.
iMovie automatically displays the incoming video in the monitor window
while it’s recorded. (As you might expect, the goofy behavior on the part
of the distinguished cast usually starts at about this moment.)
5. Click the Record with iSight button again to stop recording.
After you’ve ended the recording, iMovie creates the video clip and adds
it to your Clips pane.

I go into a lot more detail on iMovie in Chapter 4 of Book III, but that’s the
gist of recording video clips.
Controlling Your Mac Remotely with Front Row
Okay, you’ve seen some neat stuff so far, but things get really cool about now!
With Apple’s Front Row software, you can turn your Mac into a multimedia
presentation center that can show off all your digital media to your adoring
public (and friends and family to boot). In fact, with the Apple Remote, you
don’t even have to leave the comfort of the couch to start the show.
The Front Row application performs four different functions:
✦Watching DVD movies with DVD Player: If you already loaded a DVD
into your optical drive, you can watch it. (Sorry, your Mac doesn’t load
the DVD for you. I guess some things have to remain manually driven for
a few years yet.)
✦Viewing photos and slide shows: Front Row calls upon iPhoto so that
you can see your albums, film rolls, and slide shows.
✦Displaying videos in QuickTime Player: You can choose any video you
download from the iTunes Music Store or save to your Movies folder.
✦Coaxing your favorite music from your iTunes library: Find your songs
and playlists available from Front Row.
All this is accomplished with the awesome infrared Apple remote you see in
Figure 5-3. It’s as simple to use as an iPod Shuffle!

Your Apple remote isn’t designed to work with any other applications at the
time of this writing — for example, you can’t use it as a presentation aide in
PowerPoint or as a playback controller in GarageBand. However, it’s a sure
bet that Apple will continue to add functionality to the Apple remote in the
future, so check the Apple remote section of Leopard’s online help system to
keep tabs on what’s happening!

and odd scraps of paper, each of which bears an invaluable e-mail address
or phone number? If so, you can finally set yourself free and enjoy the
“Paperless Lifestyle” of the new millennium with the revolutionary new
Rauncho Digital Address Book! As seen on TV! Only $29.95 — and it 
doubles as an indestructible garden hose! But wait! If you order now, 
we’ll also send you. . . .
Of course, you and I would tune that stuff out as soon as we heard, “As seen
on TV” — but, believe it or not, the Rauncho Digital Address Book does exist
(after a fashion), and you already have one if you’ve installed Mac OS X. It’s
called the Address Book, and in this chapter, I show you how to store and
retrieve all your contact data, including iChat information, photographs, and
much more.
(And before you ask, operators are not standing by.)
Hey, Isn’t the Address Book Just a Part of Mail?
It’s true that in older versions of Mac OS X, Address Book was relegated to
the minor leagues and usually appeared only when you asked for it within
Mail. Although it could be run as a separate application, there was no con-
venient route to the Address Book from the Desktop, so most Mac owners
never launched it standalone.

Hey, Isn’t the Address Book Just a Part of Mail?

Starting with Mac OS X Panther, however, the Address Book arrived in the
limelight, earning a default location in the Dock and available whenever you
need it. Although the Address Book can still walk through a meadow hand-in-
hand with Mail, it also flirts with other Mac OS X applications and can even
handle some basic telephony chores all by itself through the use of Services.
Figure 6-1 illustrates the default face of the Address Book, complete with a
personal address card: your own contact information, which you enter
within the First Use Wizard that I mention in Book I, Chapter 1. This card car-
ries a special me tag (indicating that it’s your personal card) as well as a
suave-looking silhouette next to your name in the Name column. Other Mac
OS X applications use the data in your card to automatically fill out your per-
sonal information in all sorts of documents. (In Figure 6-1, I added a number
of well-known friends as well . . . a few TV characters, a composer or two.
You know the drill.)
Note those cool little dimples that mark the Group and Name column
dividers — click and drag the dimples, and you can resize the Group and
Name columns as well as the display window on the right. Plus, you can click
the two buttons at the upper-left corner (underneath the window controls)
to hide or show the Group and Name columns.

Entering Contact Information
Unless you actually meet and hire a group of DataElves — see the sidebar, 
“I gotta type (or retype) that stuff?” — you have to add contacts to your
Address Book manually. Allow me to demonstrate here how to create a new
contact within your Address Book:
1. Launch Address Book from the Dock by clicking its icon.
The icon looks like an old-fashioned paper Address Book with an @
symbol on the cover.
2. Press the Ô+N shortcut to create a new contact. Alternatively, choose
File➪New Card or click the Add a New Person button at the bottom of
the Name column.
Address Book displays the template that you see in Figure 6-2, with the
First name field highlighted and ready for you to type.
3. Enter the contact’s first name and press Tab to move to the Last name
field.
4. Continue entering the corresponding information in each field, press-
ing Tab to move through the fields.
If a field isn’t applicable (for example, if a person has no home page),
just press Tab again to skip it. You can press Return to add extra lines to
the Address field.
Click to add a new person
Figure 6-2:
“Hey, I don’t

Entering Contact Information
100
When you complete certain fields — like the Address field — a green
plus symbol pops up to the left of the field. That’s the Address Book
telling you that there are additional versions of the field that you can
enter as well. (Think home and work addresses.) Click this plus sign, 
and you can enter the other version. For example, if you enter an iChat
address for the contact at home, the plus sign appears; click it and then
you can enter the contact’s work iChat address, too.
5. To add a photograph to the card, just double-click the thumbnail
square next to the person’s name (or drag an image from a Finder
window on top of the thumbnail square).
Address Book displays an Open dialog that you can use to select the
image.
If your Mac has an iSight camera, you can click the Capture a picture
from a video camera button (which bears a snazzy camera icon).
6. When you’re done, click the Edit button (bottom center) to save the
card.
You can edit the contents of a card at any time by displaying it and clicking
the Edit button at the bottom (or by pressing Ô+L, or even by clicking Edit
and choosing the Edit Card menu item). You can also add new fields to a
card, such as birthdays, anniversaries, and the like.
No need to edit a card to add information to the Note field — just click and
type.
You can also add contact cards directly to your Address Book from the Mac
OS X Mail application — go figure. Within Mail, click the message (to high-
light it) from the person whom you want to add, click the friendly Message
menu, and then click Add Sender to Address Book, or press Ô+Y. Naturally,
this doesn’t add supporting information — just the person’s name and e-mail
address (and, if they used Mail on their end to send the message and they
have a photo attached to their personal card, their photo gets imported as
well). Once again, your nimble fingers have to manually enter the rest. For
more on Mail, see Book IV, Chapter 2.
Don’t forget to add those fax numbers! If you have an internal or external
analog modem, Leopard can fax from any application — just click File and
choose Print (or press Ô+P) like you always have, and then click the PDF
button at the bottom of the Print dialog and choose Fax PDF. Mac OS X auto-
matically fills in the address for you, but only if the contact has a fax number
entered as a part of the contact card.

101
If someone sends you a vCard (look for an attachment with a .vcf exten-
sion), consider yourself lucky. Just drag the vCard from the attachment
window in Mail and drop it in your Address Book; any information that the
person wants you to have is added automatically!
To delete a card, click the unlucky name to display the card, click Edit, and
then choose Delete Person.
Using Contact Information
Okay, after you have your contact information in Address Book, what can
you actually do with it? Often, all you really need is a quick glance at an
address. To display the card for any contact within Address Book, just click
the desired entry in the Name column. You can move to the next and previ-
ous cards by using the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard.
“I gotta type (or retype) that stuff?”
In my two-and-a-half decades of travel through
the personal computing world, one lovely
recurring fantasy shared by computer users
keeps cropping up over and over: I call it the
DataElf Phenomenon. You see, DataElves are
the hard-working, silicon-based gnomes in tiny
green suspenders who magically enter all the
information that you want to track into your
database (or Address Book, or Quicken, or
whatever). They burrow into your papers and
presto! — out pops all that data, neatly typed
and . . . whoa, Nellie! Let’s stop there.
For some reason, computer users seem to forget
that there are no DataElves. I wish I had a dime
for every time I’ve heard a heartbroken computer
user say, “You mean I have to type all that stuff
in?” (My usual retort is, “Affirmative . . . unless
you want to pay me a hideous amount to do it for
you.”) Make no mistake — adding a lifetime’s
worth of contact information into your Address
Book can be several hours of monotonous and
mind-bendingly boring work, which is another
reason why many computer owners still depend
on paper to store all those addresses. But take
my word for it, dear reader, your effort is worth 
it — the next time that you sit down to prepare a
batch of Christmas cards or you have to find
Uncle Milton’s telephone number in a hurry, you
will appreciate the effort that you made to enter
contact information into your Address Book.
(Just make sure that you — say it with me —
back up your hard drive.)
By the way, if you’ve already entered contact
information into another PIM (short for Personal
Information Manager), you can re-use that data
without retyping everything — that is, as long
as your old program can export contacts in
vCard format. After you export the records, just
drag the vCards into the Address Book window
to add them, or import them by pressing Ô+I.
(More on this at the end of this chapter.)

Using Contact Information
102
But wait, there’s more! You can also
✦Copy and paste. The old favorites are still around. You can copy any
data from a card (press Ô+C) and paste it into another open application
(press Ô+V).
✦Visit a contact’s home page. Click the contact entry to select it, click 
the Action button (which proudly bears a tiny gear), and click Visit
Homepage from the menu that appears. Safari dutifully answers the call,
and next thing you know, you’re online and at the home page specified in
the entry.
✦Send an e-mail message. If you’ve already read through Chapter 3 of this
mini-book, you’ll remember the Mac OS X services feature that I tell you
about. Click and drag to select any e-mail address on a card; then click
the Address Book menu, click the Services menu, and choose Send To.
Bingo! Depending on the information that you select, other services might
also be available. Alternately, you can click the Actions button and
choose Send Email.
✦Add an iChat buddy. From within iChat, click the Buddies menu and
then click Add a Buddy. From the dialog that appears, you can select a
contact card that has an Instant Messenger address and add it to your
Buddy List.
✦Export contacts. From within the Address Book, select the contacts that
you want to export, click File, and then choose Export vCards from the
Export pop-up menu. Address Book displays a Save sheet. Navigate to
the location where you want to save the cards and click Save.
✦Search amongst your contacts. If you’re searching for a specific person
and all you have is a phone number or a fragment of an address, click in
the Search field at the top right of the Address Book window and type
the text. While you continue to enter characters, Address Book shows
you how many contacts contain matching characters and displays just
those entries in the Name column. Now that’s sassy! (And convenient.
And fast as all get-out.) Check out Figure 6-3, where many of the charac-
ters from my favorite TV shows are gathered — note that a number of
very familiar folks share the same address in Gotham City, and I found
them by using the Search field.
Speaking of searching using a contact in the Address Book, Spotlight is also
at your beck and call — click a contact to select it, then click the Action
button on the toolbar and choose Spotlight from the pop-up menu. Woosh!
Leopard searches your entire system for everything related to that contact
and displays it in the familiar Spotlight window.

Arranging Your Contact Cards
103
Arranging Your Contact Cards
Address Book also provides you with a method of organizing your cards 
into groups. A group usually consists of folks with a common link, like your
family, friends, co-workers, and others who enjoy yodeling. For example, you
could set up a Cell Phone group that you can use when syncing data with
your Bluetooth cell phone.
To create a group, choose File➪New Group or press Ô+Shift+N. (Using the
Hollywood method, click the plus sign button at the bottom of the Group
column.) Address Book creates a new entry in the Group column, with a
highlighted text box so that you can type the group name. After you type the
group name, press Return to save it, and then click and drag the entries that
you want to add to the New Group icon.
If you already selected the entries for those contacts that you want to add to
the group, choose File➪New Group from Selection instead. This saves you a
step because the group is created and the members are added automatically.
After you create a New Group, you can instantly display members of that
group by clicking its icon in the Group column. To return to the display of all
your contacts, click the All Group button.
To further organize your groups, you can drag and drop a group on top of
another group. It becomes a subgroup, which is handy for things like branch
offices within your company, or perhaps relatives to whom you’re not speak-
ing at the moment.

Need an even harder-working group? Create a Smart Group, which — get 
this — automatically adds new contacts you create to the proper group,
depending on the criteria you specify! To create a Smart Group, follow 
these steps:
1. Click File and click New Smart Group.
2. Type a name for the new Smart Group.
3. Click the Card pop-up menu and choose the item that will trigger the
action.
For example, you can choose to automate a Smart Group according to
the contents of each new card, a company name, or a particular city or
state.
4. Click the Contains pop-up menu and choose the criteria for the item.
An item might contain (or not contain) a specific string of characters, or
it might have changed in a certain amount of time. To illustrate, one of
my hardest-working Smart Groups automatically checks the Company
field in every new card for my publisher’s company name and adds that
contact card to my Wiley Publishing group if a match occurs.
5. To add another criteria line, click the button with the plus sign at the
end of the first text field.
If you decide you have one criteria line too many, click the button with
the minus sign next to the offending rule.
6. After your Smart Group criteria are correct, click OK.
The Smart Group name appears in your group list. Voilà!
Here’s another handy feature of an Address Book group: You can send all the
members of a group the same e-mail message at once. Within Mail, simply
enter the Group name in the To field in the Compose window, and the same
message is sent to everyone. Even Gandalf couldn’t do that (but my copy
editor bets that Dumbledore could).
Using Network Directories
I know, I know, I said earlier that you’d have to enter all your contacts 
yourself — but I was talking about your personal contacts! You can also
access two types of external directories from within Address Book:
✦If you’re a member of a company NetInfo network — and if you don’t
know, ask your wizened network administrator — you can search net-
work directory servers from within Address Book. These servers are
available automatically, so no configuration is necessary. Sweet.

Printing Contacts with Flair
105
✦You can search Internet-based LDAP directories. Sorry, folks, I know
that’s pretty cryptic, but others have written entire books on this tech-
nology. Again, suffice it to say that your network guru can tell you
whether LDAP servers are available to you. (In another blazing display
of techno-nerd acronym addiction, LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol.) With LDAP, you can search a central company directory
from anywhere in the world as long as you have an Internet connection.
To configure this feature, click Address Book from the menu and choose
Preferences; click the LDAP tab and then click the plus sign button to
enter the specific settings for the server that you want to access. Your
network administrator or the LDAP server administrator can supply you
with these settings.
To search either type of network directory, click the Directories entry in the
Group column and use the Search field like you normally would. Matching
entries display the person’s name, e-mail address, and phone number.
“But hey, Mark, what if I’m not online? My company’s LDAP directory isn’t
much good then, right?” Normally, that’s true. If you’re a mobile user, LDAP
information is only available to you when you’re online and the LDAP server
is available. Ah, but here’s a rocking power user tip that’ll do the trick for
MacBook and MacBook Pro owners: To make a person’s information always
available, search the LDAP database and drag the resulting entry from the
Directories window to the All group. You’ll import the information to your
local Address Book — and you’ll see it even when you’re not online!
Printing Contacts with Flair
Consider how to print your contacts (for those moments when you need an
archaic hard copy). Address Book offers two different formats.
By default, Address Book prints on standard U.S. letter-size paper (81/2 x 11
inches) in portrait orientation. You can change these settings right from 
the Print dialog: Choose File and click Print or press Ô+P. From the Print
dialog, you can choose exotic settings, such as legal-size paper or landscape
orientation.
Follow these steps to print your contacts:
1. Press Ô+P.
Address Book displays the Print dialog. To show all the settings, click
the Expand button next to the Printer field, which carries a downward-
pointing triangle.
If you need more than one copy, click in the Copies field to specify the
desired number.

Need labels? We’ve got ’em! Click the Style pop-up menu and choose
Mailing Labels to specify what type of label stock you’re using on the
Layout panel. Click the Label button to sort your labels by name or
postal code, choose a font, select a text color, and add an icon or image
to your labels. To switch back to a standard contact list, click Style again
and then click Lists.
2. Select the desired Attributes check boxes to specify which contact
card fields you want to appear in your list.
The Attributes list appears only if you’re printing contacts in Lists style.
3. Click the Preview button to check the appearance of the list or click
the Print button to send the job to the selected printer.
Alternatively, you can create a PDF file in a specified location — a handy
trick to use if you’d rather not be burdened with paper, but you still
need to consult the list or give it to others. (PDF files are a special docu-
ment display format developed by Adobe; they display like a printed
document but take up minimal space and can’t be edited.) To display
the contents of a PDF file in Mac OS X, you need only double-click it in
the Finder window, and the built-in Preview application is happy to
oblige.
Swapping Bytes with vCards
A vCard is a standard file format for exchanging contacts between programs
like Address Book, Microsoft Entourage, Eudora, and the Palm computer
desktop. (Heck, if you’re lucky enough to have an iPod, you can even store
vCard data there.) Think of a vCard as an electronic business card that you
can attach to an e-mail message, send via File Transfer Protocol (FTP), or
exchange with others by using your cellular phone and palmtop computer.
vCard files end with the extension .vcf.
In Address Book, you can create a single vCard containing one or more
selected entries by choosing File➪Export and choosing Export vCards. Then,
like any other Mac OS X Save dialog, just navigate to the spot where you
want the file saved, give it a name, and click Save.
To import vCards into Address Book
✦Drag the vCard files that you’ve received to Address Book and drop
them in the application window.
✦Alternatively, choose File➪Import and click Import vCards or press
Ô+O. From the Open dialog, navigate to the location of the vCard files
that you want to add, select them, and then click Open.

Bluetooth your Address Book
If your Mac has Bluetooth hardware enabled,
you’ll see the Bluetooth button appear on the
toolbar, with that rather archaic-looking runic
symbol that we’ve all grown to know so well. To
create an enduring partnership between
Address Book and a Bluetooth device, like your
cell phone or PDA, make sure the device is
active, within range of your Mac (about 30 feet),
and set to Discoverable mode.
Ready to fuse things together? Click the Blue-
tooth button to display the Pair with a Bluetooth
Device dialog. You can specify that your device
list displays only certain devices with the Show
Only and Device Category pop-up menus . . .
personally, I only have three or four Bluetooth
devices, so I don’t have to filter the device list.
Next, click Search to discover that Bluetooth
device and add it to the device list.
Finally, click the device in the list that you want
to pair with your Address Book to select it and
then click Pair.
Now that your Address Book is speaking
directly to your Bluetooth device, you can click
any card in your Address Book to select it, then
click the Card menu and choose Send this Card.
Alternately, you can use iSync to copy your
Address Book information to your device, or
even update your Address Book contacts list
with new data. Huzzah!

T
he title of this chapter really sounds like a contradiction in terms, doesn’t
it? The concepts of joy and maintenance will likely be mutually exclusive
to you — and it’s true that most Mac OS X owners would rather work or play
than spend time under the hood, getting all grimy. I understand completely;
maintenance is far less sexy than a game like Prey, or even an exciting pro-
ductivity application like Pages.
However, if you do want your work or play uninterrupted by lockups and
crashes — yes, believe it or not, the Big X can indeed take a dive if it’s not
cared for — and you’d like your Mac to perform like Lance Armstrong, you
have to get your hands dirty. That means performing regular maintenance on
your hardware, Mac OS X, and your all-important applications, documents,
and folders.
Like most techno-types, I actually enjoy pushing my system to the limit and
keeping it running in top form. And who knows — after you become a
Leopard power user, you could find yourself bitten by the maintenance bug
as well. In this chapter, I cover how to take care of necessary tune-up
chores, step-by-step.
Deleting Applications the Common Sense Way
Nothing lasts forever, and that includes your applications. You might no
longer need an application or maybe you need to remove it to upgrade to a
new version or to reinstall it. Unlike Windows XP and Vista, Mac OS X doesn’t
have an Add or Remove Programs utility for uninstalling software — nor does
it need one because virtually all Macintosh applications are self-contained in a

Deleting Applications the Common Sense Way

single folder or series of nested folders. (And not by accident . . . it’s always
been a rule for Apple software developers since the first days of the
Macintosh.) Therefore, removing an application is usually as easy as deleting
the contents of the application folder from your hard drive.
Always check the application’s README file and documentation for any
special instructions before you delete any application folder! If you’ve cre-
ated any documents in that folder that you want to keep, don’t forget to
move them before you trash the folder and its contents.
Some applications can leave preference files, start-up applications, or driver
files in other spots on your disk besides their home folder. When you’re
uninstalling a program that has support files in other areas, use the Search
box in the Finder toolbar to locate other files that might have been created
by the application. (I cover this feature in Book II, Chapter 1.)
For example, Figure 7-1 illustrates a Spotlight search that I’ve run on
Microsoft Office 2004. By searching for the word office, I found a number of
files created in other folders, like the settings file that’s in my Preferences
folder. Typically, you want to delete the main application folder and then
remove these orphans.
Spring Cleaning, from Allume Systems ($50; www.allume.com), also has the
ability to uninstall a program, as well as a feature that can find and remove
orphaned files left from past applications.

Popping the Hood: Using the System Profiler
111
Popping the Hood: Using the System Profiler
Need hard information about your hardware? You might need to determine
precisely what hardware is installed in your Mac for the following reasons:
✦If you’re working with a technical support person to solve a problem:
This person will usually request information about your system, such as
what processor you’re running and how much memory you have.
✦If you’re evaluating an application before you buy it: You’ll want to
check its minimum system requirements against the hardware on your
Mac.
✦If you’re considering an upgrade to your Mac: You’ll likely need to
determine how much memory you have, what type it is, and which
memory slots are filled. (The same goes for your hard drive and your
video card, for those Macs with video card slots.) For more on upgrad-
ing your Mac, thumb through Book VI, Chapter 2.
Apple provides Mac OS X with an all-in-one hardware and software display
tool, aptly named System Profiler, which you can find in the Utilities folder
within your Applications folder. You can also reach the Profiler through the
Apple menu (Ú). Just click About This Mac and then click the More Info
button.
Like the folders in a Finder window in list view mode, you can expand or col-
lapse each major heading that appears in a Profiler screen. Just click the tri-
angle that appears to the left of each Contents heading to expand or collapse
that heading.
The System Profiler major headings include
✦Hardware: This heading tells you volumes about your hard drives —
forgive me, I couldn’t help that — as well as specifics concerning your
CD and DVD drives, modem, AirPort and Bluetooth hardware, graphics
hardware, AC power settings, and any FireWire and USB devices con-
nected to your system. Figure 7-2 illustrates the information from my
USB screen, with many of the devices expanded so that you can see
them. (The text you see at the bottom half of the window is the detailed
information on the item that’s selected.)
✦Network: This heading shows a listing of your network configuration,
active network connections, and other assorted network paraphernalia.
You’ll probably need this screen only when asked by a technical support
person for the network protocols that you’re using, but it’s handy
nonetheless. (You’ll find details on your network connection here that
you can’t find anywhere else in Leopard.)

Tracking Performance with Activity Monitor
112
✦Software: Okay, this heading shows something useful to the average
human being! This screen lists all the applications, fonts, and prefer-
ences recognized on your start-up volume, along with their version num-
bers. If you’re wondering whether you need to update an application
with a patch file (to fix bugs in the software) or update a file from the
developer, you can look here to check the current version number for
the application. You also get a rather boring list of the extensions (or
drivers) used by Mac OS X applications. Logs are usually valuable only
to tech support personnel; they document recent lockups, application
crashes, and even system crashes.
Tracking Performance with Activity Monitor
Our next stop in Maintenance City is a useful little application dubbed
Activity Monitor, which is specially designed to show you just how hard your
CPU, hard drives, network equipment, and memory modules are working
behind the scenes. To run Activity Monitor, open the Utilities folder in your
Applications folder.
To display each different type of usage, click the buttons in the lower half of
the window; the lower panel changes to reflect the desired type (see Figure
7-3). For example, if you click System Memory, you see the amount of unused
memory; click CPU or Network to display real-time usage of your Mac’s CPU
and network connections.

You can also display a separate window with your CPU usage; choose
Window➪CPU Usage or press Ô+2. There are three different types of cen-
tral processing unit (CPU, which is commonly called the “brain” of your
Macintosh) displays available from Activity Monitor:
✦Floating CPU window: This is the smallest display of CPU usage; the
higher the CPU usage, the higher the reading on the monitor. You can
arrange the floating window in horizontal or vertical mode from the
Window menu.
Figure 7-3:

running.
Processes for dummies
“Mark, what’s that arcane-looking list doing in
the middle of the Activity Monitor window in
Figure 7-3?” I’m glad you asked. A process is a
discrete task (either visible or invisible) that
Leopard performs in order to run your applica-
tions. (Some processes are executed by Leopard
just to keep itself running.) For example, the Dock
and Finder are actually processes, as are Adobe
Acrobat and iPhoto.
You can quit a specific process within Activity
Monitor. Just click the offending process in the
list and then click the Quit Process button on
the Activity Monitor toolbar. But tread carefully,
Mr. Holmes, for there’s danger afoot. For exam-
ple, deleting a system process (like the Dock or
Finder) can result in all of Mac OS X locking up!
Therefore, delete a process only if instructed
to do so by a support technician. If you need to
terminate a misbehaving application, click the
Apple menu and choose Force Quit instead.

Fixing Things with the Disk Utility
114
✦CPU Usage window: This is the standard CPU monitoring window, which
uses a blue thermometer-like display. The display works the same as the
floating window.
✦CPU History window: This scrolling display uses different colors to help
indicate the percentage of CPU time being used by your applications
(green) and what percentage is being used by Leopard to keep things
running (red). You can use the History window to view CPU usage over
time.
Do you have two (or more) bars in your CPU usage monitor? That’s because
you’re running one of Apple’s multiple-core G5 or Intel processors . . . more
than one engine is under the hood!
Whichever type of display you choose, you can drag the window anywhere
that you like on your Mac OS X Desktop. Use the real-time feedback to deter-
mine how well your system CPU is performing when you’re running applica-
tions or performing tasks in Mac OS X. If this meter stays peaked for long
periods of time while you’re using a range of applications, your processor(s)
are running at full capacity.
You can even monitor CPU, network, hard drive, or memory usage right from
the Dock! Choose View➪Dock Icon; then choose what type of real-time graph
you want to display in your Dock. (Feeling like a Leopard power user yet? I
thought so.) When you’re monitoring CPU usage from the Dock, the green
portion of the bar indicates the amount of processor time used by applica-
tion software, and the red portion of the bar indicates the CPU time given to
the Mac OS X operating system (just like the CPU History window).
Note, however, that seeing your CPU capacity at its max doesn’t necessarily
mean that you need a faster CPU or a new computer. For example, when I’m
running memory-ravenous applications, such as Photoshop or Word, the
Activity Monitor on my MacBook Pro is often pegged (indicating maximum
use) for several seconds at a time. The rest of the time, it barely moves.
Whether a computer is actually fast enough for you and the applications that
you run is more of a subjective call on your part.
Fixing Things with the Disk Utility
Another important application in your maintenance toolbox is the Disk
Utility, which you find — no surprise here — in the Utilities folder within
your Applications folder. When you first run this program, it looks something
like Figure 7-4, displaying all the physical disks and volumes on your system.

Book I
Chapter 7

of Maintenance

The Disk Utility application has its own toolbar that you can toggle on and
off. Click the lozenge-shaped button at the upper-right corner of the window
to display or hide the toolbar.
Displaying the goods on your disks
The volume tree structure on the left of the Disk Utility window lists both the
physical disks and the partitions that you’ve set up. A partition is nothing
more than another word for volume, which is the formatted section of a disk
that contains data. A single physical hard drive can contain several parti-
tions. The information display at the bottom of the Disk Utility window con-
tains data about both the volumes and the partitions on your hard drive.
To illustrate: On my system, clicking the drive labeled 75.5 GB (the physical
hard drive at the top of the tree) displays a description of the drive itself,
including its total capacity, interface (connection type), and whether the
drive is internal or external. (See Figure 7-5.)
Clicking the tree entry for Wolfgang, however — that’s the name of the parti-
tion that I created when I formatted the drive — displays information about
the type of formatting, the total capacity of the partition and how much of
that is used, and the number of files and folders stored on the partition (as
shown at the bottom of Figure 7-6).

Playing doctor with First Aid
From the First Aid pane, Disk Utility can be used to verify (or check) any disk
(well, almost any disk) for errors, as well as repair any errors that it finds.
Here are the two exceptions when the buttons are disabled:

✦The start-up disk: Disk Utility can’t repair the start-up disk — that’s Mac
talk for the boot drive that contains the Mac OS X system that you’re
using at the moment — which makes sense if you think about it because
that drive is currently being used!
If you have multiple operating systems on multiple disks, you can boot
from another Mac OS X installation on another drive to check your cur-
rent start-up disk. Or, you can boot your system from the original Mac
OS X installation CD and run Disk Utility from the Installation menu.
✦Write-protected disks: Although you can use the Disk Utility to verify CDs,
DVDs, and write-protected removable disk drives (like a write-protected
Zip disk), it can’t repair them. (Sound of my palm slapping my forehead.)
You usually can’t repair a disk that has open files that are currently
being used. If you’re running an application from a drive or you’ve
opened a document that’s stored on that drive, you probably can’t
repair that drive.
So what’s a disk image?
You might have noticed the New Image button
on the Disk Utility toolbar (or the image creation
commands on the File➪New submenu). If you’re
wondering what a disk image is, you’ve come to
the right place. Think of a disk image as a file that
looks (and acts) like an external storage device
within Leopard; for example, a mounted disk
image operates much like a CD or DVD, and it
can be ejected just like a disc. Images can be
read-only (just like a standard CD-ROM or DVD-
ROM), or they can be created blank (just like an
empty hard drive), ready to accept files and fold-
ers that you copy using the Finder.
So what are images used for? They’re great for
storing data that would normally have to be
loaded from a CD or DVD (a great convenience
if you don’t want to lug optical media along with
you during a vacation). Remember, a disk image
acts just like removable storage media as far as
Leopard’s concerned. Many Mac Web sites also
offer images as download files because a simple
double-click is all that’s necessary to automati-
cally mount a disk image. (Software developers
like words like fast and simple when offering
their shareware and demo applications to the
public.)
Finally, images are often used to create simple
archives of little-used data: The images can 
be burned to CD/DVD or even copied to other
hard drives. Oh, and don’t forget the security
aspect — you can choose to encrypt the data
stored in an image, protecting it from prying
eyes. (However, I don’t recommend using disk
images to create full backups of your Mac’s hard
drives; more on this elsewhere in the chapter.)
To restore a disk image, you can use the Restore
tab in Disk Utility.
If you’re intrigued, I encourage you to click New
Image on the Disk Utility toolbar (see Figure 7-5)
and create a simple, unencrypted blank disk
image on your Desktop. Then you can experi-
ment with it. A disk image can be ejected to
unmount it (just like a CD/DVD, an iPod, or a USB
Flash drive), and you can delete the image file at
any time. (Just remember not to delete it if it con-
tains anything you want to keep, of course . . .
but you knew that already.)

Fixing Things with the Disk Utility
118
You can also elect to verify and repair permissions (or privileges) on a disk;
these are the read/write permissions that I discuss in detail in Book II,
Chapter 6. If you can’t save or move a file that you should be able to access, I
recommend checking that drive for permissions problems. Unlike fixing disk
errors, you can verify and repair permissions on any volume that contains a
Mac OS X installation (whether it was used to boot your Mac or not).
In order to verify or repair, you must be logged in as an admin-level user.
To verify or repair a drive, first select the target volume/partition in the list
at the left. To check the contents of the drive and display any errors, click
the Verify Disk button. Or, to verify the contents of the drive and fix any
problems, click the Repair Disk button. (I usually just click Repair Disk
because an error-free disk needs no repairs.) Disk Utility displays any status
or error messages in the scrolling list; if you have eagle eyes, you’ll note that
the window can be resized so that you can expand it to display more mes-
sages. (You can also drag the dot between the left and right panes to expand
the list.)
I generally check my disks once every two or three days. If your Mac is
caught by a power failure or Mac OS X locks up, however, it’s a good idea to
immediately check disks after you restart your Mac. (Don’t forget that the
start-up volume is automatically checked and repaired, if necessary.)
A number of very good commercial disk repair utilities are on the market. My
favorite is Drive Genius from Prosoft Engineering ($99; www.prosofteng.
com) — however, Disk Utility does a good job on its own, and it’s free.
Erasing without seriously screwing up
“Danger, Will Robinson! Danger!” That’s right, Robot, it is indeed very easy to
seriously screw up and get Lost in Erase. (Man, I can’t believe I actually typed
such a bad pun. I have no shame.) Anyway, it’s time for another of Mark’s
Maxims. To paraphrase the rules for handling a firearm responsibly:
Never click the Erase tab unless you mean to use it.
Figure 7-7 illustrates the Erase controls within Disk Utility. You need to erase
a disk or volume only when you want to completely wipe the contents of that
existing disk or volume. You can also erase a rewriteable CD (CD-RW) or DVD
(DVD-RW, DVD+RW, or DVD-RAM) from this pane.
✦Erasing an entire disk deletes all volumes on the disk and creates a single
new, empty volume.
✦Erasing a volume only wipes the contents of that specific volume, leaving
all other volumes on the physical disk untouched.

Book I

of Maintenance

119
To erase, follow these steps:
1. Click the disk or volume icon that you want to erase from the list on
the left side of the screen.
2. Click the Erase tab.
3. Click the format that you want to use from the Volume Format pop-up
menu.
Always choose Mac OS Extended (Journaled) entry from the Volume
Format list unless you have a specific reason to use the MS-DOS File
System (for compatibility with PCs running Windows) or the UNIX 
File System (for compatibility with UNIX/Linux machines). In some cases,
Disk Utility will force you to choose the Mac OS Extended entry instead,
but the end result is the same. Note that you do not need to format a disk
or volume with the MS-DOS File System just to read or write a floppy or a
Zip disk from a PC system — Mac OS X recognizes MS-DOS removable
media without a problem.
4. In the Name field, type the name for the volume.
If you’re erasing an existing volume, the default is the existing name.
5. If you’re worried about security, click Security Options and specify
the method you want to use.
By default, this is set to Don’t Erase Data, so Disk Utility doesn’t actually
overwrite any data while formatting — instead, it simply trashes the
existing directory, rendering that data unreachable. Or is it? With some
third-party disk utilities, some unscrupulous bum could actually recover
your files if you choose, so you can specify alternate, more secure 
Figure 7-7:

Fixing Things with the Disk Utility
120
methods of erasing a disk or volume. Unfortunately, these more secure
erasure methods can take a horrendous amount of time.
Therefore, it’s okay to use the Don’t Erase Data option unless you want
to make sure, or use the Zero Out Data to take a more secure route with
the least amount of extra waiting. For example, you’d want to use the
Zero Out Data option if you’re selling your Mac on eBay and you’re 
formatting the drive for the new owner. If you’re really set on the tight-
est, government-quality security, select either 7-Pass Erase or 35-Pass
Erase . . . but make sure you have plenty of time to spare!
You can even click Erase Free Space to wipe the supposedly “clean”
areas of your drive before you format. Man, talk about airtight security!
Again, the Zero Out method is the fastest.
6. Click the Erase button.
In the sheet that appears, click Erase to confirm that you do actually
want to do the deleterious deed.
Partitioning the right way
From time to time, just about everyone wishes they had additional volumes
handy for organizing files and folders, or at least a little extra space on a par-
ticular partition. If you find yourself needing another volume on a disk — or
if you need to resize the total space on existing volumes on a disk — click
the Partition tab within Disk Utility to display the controls that you see in
Figure 7-8. (Make sure that you select a disk and not a volume.) From here,
you can choose a volume scheme, creating anywhere from 1 to 16 volumes
on a single disk.
Figure 7-8:

You can’t monkey around with the partitions on a start-up disk because Mac
OS X is currently running on that disk. (Think about removing your own
appendix, and you get the idea.) Also, if you resize an existing volume, you
may lose files and folders on that volume — Disk Utility prompts you for per-
mission, but it’s always a good idea to back up a partition before you resize it!
To set up the partitions on a disk, follow these steps:
1. From the Partition panel within Disk Utility, click the disk icon (left
side of the pane) that you want to partition.
2. Click the Volume Scheme pop-up menu and choose the total number
of volumes that you want on the selected disk.
3. Click the first volume block in the partition list (under the Volume
Scheme pop-up menu) to select it.
I have only one partition set for this disk, as you can see.
4. Click in the Name field and enter the name for the selected volume.
5. From the Format pop-up menu, choose a format for the volume.
Always use Mac OS Extended or Mac OS Extended (Journaled) from the
Format list unless you have a specific reason to use the MS-DOS File
System (for compatibility with PCs running Windows) or the UNIX 
File System (for compatibility with UNIX/Linux machines).
6. Type a total size for this volume in the Size field.
7. After you set up your first volume partition, mark the Locked for
Editing check box to prevent any further changes to that volume.
8. If you’re creating multiple volumes, click the next volume block to
select it and repeat Steps 4–7.
9. To delete a partition from your new scheme, click the unwanted
volume and then click the Delete button to remove it.
If the partition is locked, clear the Locked for Editing check box before
deleting it.
10. To split a partition from your new scheme into two volumes, click the
desired volume and then click the Split button.
Some folks create multiple volumes so that they can boot from multiple
versions of Leopard — like us author types.
If the partition is locked, clear the Locked for Editing check box before
splitting it.
11. After everything is set to your liking, click the Partition button to
begin the process.

Fixing Things with the Disk Utility
122
If you suddenly decide against a partition change, click the Revert
button to return to the original existing partition scheme.
The Revert button is available only before you click the Partition button!
If you have more than one partition, check out the bar(s) with a handle
separating the volumes in the partition list. If you leave all your partitions
unlocked (by leaving the Locked for Editing check box disabled), you can
click and drag these separator bars to dynamically resize the volumes.
This makes it easy to adjust the individual volume sizes for the disk until
you get precisely the arrangement you want. If a volume is locked, it can’t
be resized dynamically in this fashion.
RAID has nothing to do with insects
The next stop on the Disk Utility hayride isn’t for everyone — as a matter of
fact, only a Mac OS X power user with a roomful of hardware is likely to use
it. RAID, Redundant Array of Independent/Inexpensive Disks, is actually what
it says. In normal human English, a RAID set is a group of multiple separate
disks, working together as a team. RAID can
✦Improve the speed of your system
✦Help prevent disk errors from compromising or corrupting your data
The RAID controls within Disk Utility are illustrated in Figure 7-9. (Note that
I’ve turned on the Disk Utility toolbar as well, just to show you what it looks
like.) You need at least two additional hard drives on your system besides
the start-up disk, which I don’t recommend that you use in a RAID set.
Figure 7-9:

Updating Mac OS X
123
To set up a RAID array in Mac OS X, follow these steps:
1. From the RAID tab of Disk Utility, click and drag the disks from the list
at the left to the Disk box at the right.
2. Click the RAID Type pop-up menu to specify the type of RAID that you
need.
• Striped RAID Set: Choosing this can speed up your hard drive per-
formance by splitting data between multiple disks.
• Concatenated RAID Set: Choosing this allows several volumes (or
even multiple disks) to appear as one volume within Leopard.
• Mirrored RAID Set: Choosing this increases the reliability of your stor-
age by creating a mirror backup of that data across multiple disks.
3. Click in the RAID Set Name field and type the name for your RAID set.
4. From the Volume Format pop-up menu, choose a format for the volumes.
Always use Mac OS Extended or Mac OS Extended (Journaled) from the
Volume Format list unless you have a specific reason to use the MS-DOS
File System (for compatibility with PCs running Windows) or the 
UNIX File System (for compatibility with UNIX/Linux machines).
Journaling helps reduce the amount of disk fragmentation and also 
helps speed up your hard drive’s performance.
5. Click the Create button.
Updating Mac OS X
As any good software developer should, Apple constantly releases improve-
ments to Mac OS X in the form of software updates. These updates can
include all sorts of fun stuff, like
✦Bug fixes
✦Improvements and new features
✦Enhanced drivers
✦Security upgrades
✦Firmware upgrades
Apple makes it easy to keep Mac OS X up-to-date with the Software Update
controls in System Preferences.
You don’t even have to display the System Preferences window to check for
new software updates manually. Click the Apple menu in the Finder menu bar
and then choose Software Update to perform a manual check immediately.

I Demand That You Back Up Your Hard Drive
124
To check for new updates periodically, display the Software Update pane in
System Preferences and click the Scheduled Check tab. Enable the Check for
Updates check box and choose how often you want these updates from the
pop-up menu. (I suggest at least weekly, if not daily.) For a manual check,
make sure that you’re connected to the Internet and then click the Check
Now button.
To download updates automatically, mark the Download Important Updates
in the Background check box to enable it; the Big X politely downloads the
updates behind the scenes and then alerts you that they’re ready to be
installed. (With automatic downloading disabled, Mac OS X displays any
available updates with short descriptions, and you can toggle the installation
of a specific update by enabling or disabling the check boxes next to it.)
I recommend installing all updates, even for hardware that you don’t have
yet. For example, I always install AirPort updates even though I don’t use an
AirPort connection at home. The reason? Often, the functionality covered by
an update may include system software that you do use, so you’ll still bene-
fit from installing it.
After you specify the updates that you want to install, click the Install button
to begin the update process. You might have to reboot after everything has
been installed.
To see which updates you’ve installed already, click the Installed Updates
tab on the Software Update pane in System Preferences.
I Demand That You Back Up Your Hard Drive
I know we’re friends, but there’s no excuse for not backing up your data. The
more valuable and irreplaceable your documents are, the more heinous it is
to risk losing them. (I don’t get to use the word heinous in many of my books,
but it fits really well here.)
Although Apple does include the ability to create disk images and restore
them in the Disk Utility (see the sidebar “So what’s a disk image?,” earlier in
this chapter), I don’t recommend that you use disk images as your compre-
hensive backup solution. (Insert sound of stunned silence here.) That’s
because the restore process can be confusing, and the disk image method
doesn’t offer the level of control that you need when it comes to backing up
individual files and folders (or selectively backing up by date or recent use).
If you do create backup datasets using disk images, they can be restored
from the Restore tab in Disk Utility. You can also restore from a volumes —
typically, a volume you want to restore would be saved on a DVD or on an
external hard drive.

“Okay, Mark, what do I use to back up my valuable data?” Well, good 
citizen, only a bona fide backup application gives you such flexibility 
and convenience . . . and that’s why Leopard power users turn to Time
Machine, a new feature that makes restoring files as easy as pointing and
clicking!
Hitching a ride on the Time Machine
If you enable backups through Leopard’s new Time Machine feature, you 
can literally move backward through the contents of your Mac’s hard drive,
selecting and restoring all sorts of data. Files and folders are ridiculously
easy to restore — and I mean easier than any restore you’ve ever performed,
no matter what the operating system or backup program. Time Machine can
even handle things like deleted Address Book entries and photos you’ve sent
to the Trash from iPhoto!
Because Time Machine should be an important and integral part of every
Mac owner’s existence, the Time Machine icon is included in the Dock.
(Apple is not messing around!)
Before you can use Time Machine, it must be enabled within the Time
Machine pane in System Preferences. I cover these settings in detail in
Chapter 3 of Book II.
Here’s how you can turn back time, step-by-step, to restore a file that you
deleted or replaced in a folder.
1. Open the folder that contained the file you want to restore.
2. In a separate window, open your Applications folder and launch the
Time Machine application, or click the Time Machine icon in the Dock.
The oh-so-ultra-cool Time Machine background appears behind your
folder, complete with its own set of buttons at the bottom of the screen
(as shown in Figure 7-10). On the right, you see a timeline that corre-
sponds to the different days and months included in the backups that
Leopard has made.
3. Click within the timeline to jump directly to a date (displaying the
folder’s contents on that date).
Alternately, use the Forward and Back arrows at the right to move
through the folder’s contents through time. (You should see the faces of
Windows users when you “riffle” through your folders to locate some-
thing you deleted several weeks ago!)
The backup date of the items you’re viewing appear in the button bar at
the bottom of the screen.
4. After you locate the file you want to restore, click it to select it.

I Demand That You Back Up Your Hard Drive
126
5. Click the Restore button at the right side of the Time Machine
button bar.
If you want to restore all of the contents of the folder, click the Restore
All button instead.
Time Machine returns you to the Finder, with the newly restored file now
appearing in the folder. OUTstanding!
To restore specific data from your Address Book or images from iPhoto,
launch the desired application first and then launch Time Machine. Instead
of riffling a Finder window, you can move through time within the applica-
tion window.
For simple backup and restore protection, Time Machine is all that a typical
Mac owner at home is likely to ever need. Therefore, a very easy Mark’s
Maxim to predict:
Turn on Time Machine. Do it now. Don’t make a heinous mistake.
How about that? I got to use heinous twice in one chapter.

127
Using other backup solutions
Time Machine is indeed awesome, but some Mac owners prefer a more tradi-
tional automated backup and restore process — one that doesn’t involve
running the Time Machine application and navigating through the files and
folders on a drive. For example, a person backing up a Mac acting as a Web
server or iTunes media server would much rather restore the entire con-
tents of a volume automatically, in bulk, or create a custom backup/restore
schedule that safeguards only certain files and folders.
If you subscribe to Apple’s .Mac service, a back-up utility is included, but 
it’s not a part of the default Mac OS X package. Therefore, if you’re not a
.Mac member, you can turn to a commercial back-up application for your 
salvation — my personal recommendation is EMC Retrospect, from EMC
(www.emcinsignia.com). This well-written “software bungee cord” has
saved my posterior more than once.
Using EMC Retrospect is cheap security, but if you can’t afford it at the
moment, take a second to at least back up your most important documents
by copying them to a rewriteable CD or a Zip disk. Don’t trust a floppy (if
your Mac is actually old enough to sport a floppy drive); they’re far too unre-
liable. With this poor man’s backup, even if you lose your entire hard drive,
you can still restore what matters the most.
I Further Demand That You Defragment
Defragmenting your hard drive can significantly improve its performance.
Using a defragmenter scans for little chunks of a file that are spread out
across the surface of your hard drive and then arranges them to form a con-
tiguous file. After a file has been optimized in this way, it’s far easier and
faster for Mac OS X to read than reassembling a fragmented file.
However, Apple dropped the ball on this one and didn’t include a defrag-
menter with Mac OS X. Luckily, many third-party disk utilities (like the
aforementioned Drive Genius from Prosoft Engineering) also include a
defragmenting feature. If you have a defragmenter, I recommend that you
use it once a month.
Special Start-Up Keys for Those Special Times
Mac OS X includes a number of special keys that you can use during the
boot process. These keys really come in handy when you need to force your
operating system to do something that it normally wouldn’t, like boot from a
CD instead of the hard drive.

Crave the Newest Drivers
128
✦To boot from a CD or DVD: Restart your Mac while pressing the C key.
This is a great way to free up your start-up volume when you want to
test it or optimize it using a commercial utility.
✦To eject a recalcitrant disc that doesn’t show up on the Desktop:
Restart Mac OS X and hold down the mouse button — or if you have a
late-model Mac, press the Media Eject key as soon as you hear that 
magnificent startup chord.
✦To force your Mac to boot in Mac OS X: Hold down the X key while
restarting or booting the Mac.
✦To display a system boot menu: Hold down the Option key while
restarting or booting the Mac, and you can choose which operating
system you want to use.
✦To prevent start-up applications from running during login: Hold down
the Shift key while you click the Login button on the Login screen. If you
don’t see the Login screen during startup, just hold down Shift while
Mac OS X boots until the Finder menu appears.
Crave the Newest Drivers
No chapter on maintenance would be complete without a reminder to keep
your hardware drivers current. Drivers are simply programs that allow your
Mac to control hardware devices, like a video card or a Small Computer
System Interface (SCSI) card that you’ve added to your Mac. The Mac OS X
Software Update feature that I discuss earlier in the section, “Updating Mac
OS X,” provides most of the drivers that you’ll need for things like printers,
USB and FireWire peripherals, and digital cameras, but it’s still very impor-
tant to check those manufacturer Web sites.
Like the software updates from Apple, updated drivers can fix bugs and even
add new features to your existing hardware, which is my definition of some-
thing for nothing.

hether the voice echoes from a living room, home office, or college
computer lab, it’s all too familiar: a call for help. No matter how well
written the application or how well designed the operating system, sooner
or later you’re going to need support. That goes for everyone from the
novice to the experienced Mac owner to the occasional e-mail user to the
most talented software developer.
In this short but oh-so-important chapter, I lead you through the various help
resources available within Mac OS X as well as native Mac OS X applications.
I show you how to tap additional resources from Apple, and I also point you
to other suppliers of high-quality (and even questionable) assistance from
sources on the Internet and in your local area.
Displaying the Help Viewer Window
Your first line of defense is the Mac OS X Help Viewer, as shown in Figure 8-1.
To display the Help Viewer from the Finder menu, click Help and choose Mac
Help; or, you can press the Ô+? keyboard shortcut (or, if you think about it,
Ô+Shift+/, or the forward slash key keyboard shortcut). This Help menu is
context-sensitive, so it contains different menu items when you’re working
inside an application.
As shown in Figure 8-1, the Help Viewer is divided into three sets of controls:
✦Toolbar: The toolbar includes navigational controls (Back, Forward, and
Help Center buttons), an Action button (where you can print a topic or
change the text size), and the Ask a Question (or Search) text box.
✦Quick Clicks: Clicking these links takes you directly to some of the most
frequently asked Help topics for the Finder (or the application you’re
using), such as Connecting to the Internet and Switching from Windows.

Searching for Specific Stuff
130
To use a Quick Click, just click once on the question that you want to
pursue.
✦Apple Web site link: Click this link to display the latest Mac OS X news
and the latest Help topics from the Apple Web site.
I know that the Help Viewer looks a little sparse at first glance. However,
when you realize how much information has to be covered to help someone
with an operating system — check out the size of the book you’re holding,
for instance — you get an idea of why Mac OS X doesn’t try to cover every-
thing on one screen. Instead, you get the one tool that does it all: the
Spotlight search box.
Searching for Specific Stuff
To search for the help topic you need, here are two paths to righteousness:
✦From the Finder Help menu: Wowzers! In Leopard, you don’t even have
to open the Help Viewer to search for assistance on a specific topic . . .
just choose Help from the Finder menu, click in the Search field right
there in the menu, and type a keyword or two. (Although you can ask a
full sentence question, I find that the shorter and more concise your
search criteria is, the better the relevance of your return.) Like the

Spotlight search box, there’s no need to press Return; just click the topic
that sounds the most helpful.

the toolbar, type one or two words that sum up your question, and press
Return. Figure 8-2 illustrates a typical set of topics concerning DVD

No matter which method you use, note that the topics are sorted by approxi-
mate relevance first. Within the Help Viewer, articles taken from the AppleCare
Support section of the Apple Web site appear in the Support Articles portion
of the window. (Because Web stuff is going on in the background, you don’t
see these articles unless your Mac has an active Internet connection.)
To sort the topics alphabetically or by their probable relevance within the
Help Viewer, click the Title or Rank column headings, respectively. You can
click a column heading again to toggle the sort order between ascending and
descending.
You can double-click any topic to display the topic text, which looks like the

Prodding Apple for the Latest Gossip
As I mention in the earlier section, “Displaying the Help Viewer Window,” in
this chapter, I heartily recommend that you visit the Apple Web site at
www.apple.com and surf wildly to and fro. You’ll often pick up on news and
reviews that you won’t find anywhere else on the Internet.
From the opening Web screen, click these three links during every visit to
the Apple site: the Hot News link on the Apple tab, the Support tab, and the
Mac OS X tab. These pages give you
✦Articles about the latest news from Cupertino
✦Downloads of the latest Mac OS X freeware, shareware, and demo-ware
✦The Knowledge Base (an online searchable troubleshooting reference)
✦News about upcoming versions of Mac OS X and Apple applications
galore
You’ll also find Mac OS X product manuals in Adobe Acrobat PDF format and
online discussion forums that cover Mac OS X.
Calling for Help Deep in the Heart of X
A number of different help avenues are available within Mac OS X applica-
tions as well. They include
Figure 8-3:

✦The Help button: A number of otherwise upstanding Mac OS X windows,
dialogs, and System Preference panes include a Help button, as shown in
the lower right of Figure 8-4. Click the button marked with ? to display
the text for the settings in that dialog or window.
✦Pop-up help for fields and controls: Most Mac OS X applications display
a short line of help text when you hover the mouse pointer on top of a
field or control. Sometimes it’s just the name of the item; sometimes it’s
a full descriptive line. Them’s the breaks.
✦Application-specific help: Applications typically have their own Help
system, which can use the Help Viewer, a separate Help display program,
or a HyperText Markup Language (HTML; read that Web-based) Help
system.
Other Resources to Chew On
Although the Help Viewer can take care of just about any question that you
might have about the basic controls and features of Mac OS X, you might
also want to turn to other forms of help when the going gets a little rougher.
In this last section, I cover resources that you can call on when the Help
Viewer just isn’t enough.
Voice support
As of this writing, Apple provides voice technical support for Mac OS X. You
can find the number to call in your Mac’s printed manuals or online in the
Support section of the Apple Web site. However, exactly when you qualify for
voice support and exactly how long it lasts depends on a number of different
Figure 8-4:
Notice the

134
factors, like whether you received Mac OS X when you bought a new
machine, or whether you purchased a support plan from Apple.
You can also try the general online support site at www.info.apple.com —
it’s a great starting point for obtaining Mac OS X help.
Mac publications and resource sites
You can refer to a number of great Mac-savvy publications and resources,
both printed and online, for help. My favorites include
✦Macworld (www.macworld.com) and MacAddict (www.macaddict.com)
magazines, both in archaic hard copy and oh-so-slick online versions
✦MacGamer (www.macgamer.com), the online gaming resource for the
Macintosh
✦VersionTracker (www.versiontracker.com), an online resource for
the latest updates on all sorts of Macintosh third-party applications
✦MacFixIt (www.macfixit.com), a well-respected troubleshooting site
devoted to the Mac that offers downloads, news, and discussion areas (a
subscription is required for some of the more useful sections of the site)
In most of my books, I mention specific Internet newsgroups that cater to
the topic I’m discussing — however, virtually all the Mac-specific news-
groups are devoted to illegally swapping pirated games and applications, so I
don’t cover them. Also, the help that you receive from individuals in news-
groups is sometimes misguided — and sometimes downright wrong, so take
any claims with a grain of salt.
As a general rule, never identify yourself or provide your snail-mail or e-mail
addresses in a newsgroup post! These messages are public, and they remain
hanging around in cyberspace on newsgroup servers for years — you’ll be a
prime target for spam (or even worse).
Local Mac outlets and user groups
Finally, you can find local resources in any medium- to large-sized town or
city: A shop that’s authorized by Apple to sell and repair Macintosh comput-
ers can usually be counted upon to answer a quick question over the phone
or provide more substantial support for a fee. (For example, my local Mac
outlet sponsors inexpensive classes for new Mac owners, and if you can
reach an Apple Store, the Genius Bar is a great resource.)
You might also be lucky enough to have a local Macintosh user group that
you can join — members can be counted on for free answers to your sup-
port questions at meetings and demonstrations. To find a group near you,
visit the Apple User Group Support site at www.apple.com/usergroups
and use the locator.

M
ac OS X Leopard is rugged, stable, and reliable — and as you can read
in Chapter 7 of this mini-book, practicing regular maintenance can
help eliminate problems caused by everything from power failures to faulty
software drivers to cats upon the keyboard. However, sooner or later you
will encounter what I like to call The Dark Moments . . . a blank screen, a
locked Mac, or an external device that sits there uselessly like an expensive
paperweight.
How you handle The Dark Moments defines you as a true Mac OS X power
user because most folks seem to fall into one of two categories: Either you
panic and beat your head against the wall (which really has little effect on
the computer, when you think about it), or you set your brow in grim 
determination and follow the troubleshooting models that I provide in this
chapter to locate (and hopefully fix) the source of the problem.
Don’t Panic!
My friend, this is the first — and most important — rule of troubleshooting,
and yet another of Mark’s Maxims:
Whatever the problem, you can fix it.
Most computer owners seem to forget the idea that a hardware or software
error can be fixed because they panic — they simply see The Problem, and
somehow they feel that they’ll never be able to use their computer again.
Although the situation might look grim, don’t ignore these facts:
✦You don’t need to scrap your Mac. As long as you haven’t taken a
hammer or a chainsaw to your Mac, the problem is only temporary.
Sure, individual components do fail over time — heck, so do people —
but the problem is certainly something that can be tracked down and
fixed without scrapping your entire computer.

The Troubleshooting Process
136
✦Don’t beat yourself up. As long as you haven’t installed a virus on pur-
pose or deleted half your system files to spite yourself, the problem isn’t
your fault. Sure, it’s possible that you might have done something by
accident, but don’t blame yourself — it happens to everybody.
✦Trust your Apple dealer. As long as an Apple dealer is in your area, you
can always get your computer repaired professionally if a component’s
gone south. (In some cases, professional help is a necessity: For exam-
ple, I’d be a fool to try to fix a power supply or a monitor on my own
because both can pack a heavy electrical punch.)
✦Rely on your backup. As long as you’ve made a backup you won’t lose
much (if any) work. (You did back up your hard drive, didn’t you? I harp
about backups further in Chapter 7 of this mini-book.) I’m talking about
a backup to an external hard drive here, either using an application like
Disk Utility or Leopard’s Time Machine feature.
Commit these facts to head and heart, and you can rest easy while you track
down and attack the real enemy — whatever’s causing the problem.
The Troubleshooting Process
When I first conceived this chapter, I had originally decided to divide this
section into separate hardware and software troubleshooting procedures.
However, that turned out to be impractical because often you won’t know
whether a problem is caused by hardware or software until you’re practi-
cally on top of it.
Therefore, here’s the complete 12-step troubleshooting process that I
designed while working as a consultant and Macintosh hardware technician
for more than a decade. Feel free to add your own embellishments in the
margin or include reminders with Post-it Notes.
If you’re not sure quite what’s producing the error, this process is designed
to be linear — meaning that it’s meant to be followed in order — but if you
already know that you’re having a problem with one specific peripheral or
one specific application, feel free to jump to the steps that concern only
hardware or software.
It’s always a good idea to create a completely default user account for trou-
bleshooting — techs call this a vanilla or clean account. You can use the
vanilla account to test whether a problem occurs system-wide, or whether
the problem is limited to a single user account. For example, this is a great
way to determine if an application is misbehaving because of a corrupted
preference file: If the same problem doesn’t appear when you use the appli-
cation with the vanilla account, the culprit is likely the user’s copy of the
application’s preference file. (Follow the instructions provided by the appli-
cation for resetting or deleting the preference file it creates.)

The Troubleshooting Process
137
Step 1: Always try a simple shutdown
You’d be amazed at how often a reboot (the process of shutting down and
restarting) can cure a temporary problem. For example, this can fix the occa-
sional lockup in Mac OS X or a keyboard that’s not responding because of a
power failure. If possible, make sure that you first close any open documents,
or you might lose unsaved work. When troubleshooting, always do a shut-
down instead of simply restarting the computer because when Mac OS X 
shuts down, all the hardware components that make up your system are reset.
If your Mac is locked tight and you can’t use the Shut Down command from
the Apple menu (Ú), you have two choices. First, press and hold the Power
button on your Mac for a few seconds (which turns your computer off). If
this doesn’t work — and, from time to time, it actually doesn’t — you have to
physically pull the power cord from the wall (or turn off the surge suppres-
sor, if you’re using one).
Step 2: Check all cable connections
Check all connections: the AC power cord and the keyboard cord, as well as
any modem or network connections and all cable connections to external
peripherals. Look for loose connectors — and if you have a cat or dog, don’t
forget to check for chew marks. (Yep, that’s the voice of experience talking
there.) If you’ve recently replaced a cable — especially a network, Universal
Serial Bus (USB), or FireWire cable — replace it with a spare to see whether
the problem still occurs.
Step 3: Retrace your steps
If the problem continues to occur, the next step is to consider what you’ve
done in the immediate past that could have affected your Mac. Did you install
any new software or have you connected a new peripheral? If your Mac was
working fine until you made the change to your system, the problem likely
lies in the new hardware or software.
✦If you added an external device: Turn off your Mac and disconnect the
peripheral. Then turn on the computer to see whether all proceeds nor-
mally. If so, check the peripheral’s documentation and make sure that
you correctly installed the driver — the software provided by the device
manufacturer — and that you connected it properly to the right port.
(You can also use System Profiler, which I discuss later in this chapter, to
check to see whether your Mac recognizes the external device.) To verify
that the cable works, substitute another cable of the same type or try the
peripheral on another Mac.
Make it a practice to check the manufacturer’s Web site for the latest driver
when you get new hardware. The software that ships in the box with your
new toy could have been on the shelf for months before being sold, and
the manufacturer has probably fine-tuned the driver in the interim.

The Troubleshooting Process
138
✦If you installed new software or applied an update/patch: Follow the
guidelines in Chapter 7 of this mini-book to uninstall the application and
search for any files that it might have installed elsewhere. (Searching by
date created and date modified can help you locate files that you
recently installed.) If this fixes the problem, it’s time to contact the
developer and request technical support for the recalcitrant program;
you can always re-install the program after the problem has been solved
by the developer.
Not all versions of Mac OS X are created equal. If you’ve recently
upgraded to a major or minor new release of Mac OS X, some of the appli-
cations that you’ve been using without trouble for months can suddenly
go on the warpath and refuse to work (or exhibit quirky behavior). If this
happens, visit the developer’s Web site often to look for a patch file that
will update the application to work with the new version of Mac OS X.
✦If you recently made a change within System Preferences: It’s possible
that you’ve inadvertently “bumped” something. For instance, you might
have accidentally changed your modem or network settings or perhaps
made a change to your login options. Verify the settings screens that you
visited to make sure that everything looks okay.
Step 4: Run Disk Utility
Next, run Disk Utility (as shown in Figure 9-1) to check for disk errors and
permissions errors — especially permissions errors, which can wreak
absolute havoc on just about any application on your hard drive. (Click the
Disk Utility icon in the Utilities folder inside your Applications folder.
Chapter 7 of this mini-book provides all the details.)
Figure 9-1:

Utility to

integrity of

139
Step 5: Run antivirus software
Run your antivirus software and scan your entire system for viruses, includ-
ing all system disks and removable disks. Although Mac OS X doesn’t come
with antivirus protection built in, the world-class programs Norton AntiVirus
(www.symantec.com) and Intego VirusBarrier (www.intego.com) con-
stantly scan each file that you open or download for infections.
If you haven’t already set your antivirus application to automatically update
itself, download the latest virus update — usually called a signature file or
data file — to keep your virus protection current.
Step 6: Check the Trash
Check the contents of your Trash to make sure that you haven’t inadvertently
tossed something important that could be causing trouble for an application.
Click the Trash icon on the Dock to open the Trash window and peruse its
contents. (To see the file types easier, switch to list mode.) To restore items
to their rightful place, drag them from the Trash back to the correct folder on
your hard drive.
Step 7: Check online connections
If you’re connected to an Ethernet network, a cable modem, or a digital sub-
scriber line (DSL), check your equipment to make sure that you’re currently
online and receiving packets normally. Your network system administrator
will be happy to help you with this, especially if you’re blood relatives.
Step 8: Disable troublesome Login Items
Disable any Login Items that might be causing trouble. As you can read in
Book II, Chapter 3, Login Items are launched automatically as soon as you
log in. For example, an older application that doesn’t fully support Mac OS X
can cause problems if used as a Login Item. You can do this from the Login
Items settings in the System Preferences Accounts panel (as shown in Figure
9-2); click the Apple menu, choose System Preferences, click Accounts, and
then click the Login Items button.
Unfortunately, if a Login Item doesn’t display an error message, your old friend
Trial-and-Error is just about the only sure-fire way to detect which item (if any)
is causing the problem. Click an item to select it, click the Remove button
(marked with a minus sign), and then press Ô+Q to quit System Preferences.
Shut down and reboot your Mac to see whether the problem’s solved. (If not,
don’t forget to add the item again to the Login Items list.)
You can also disable Login Items entirely when you reboot. If the login
window appears when you reboot your computer, hold down the Shift key
and then click the Login button. If you don’t see the login window when you
reboot, hold down the Shift key when you see the progress bar in the startup
window and continue to hold down the key until the Finder appears.

The Troubleshooting Process
140
Step 9: Turn off your screen saver
Another candidate for intermittent lockups is your screen saver, especially if
you’re running a shareware effort written by a 12-year-old with a limited atten-
tion span. Display your System Preferences, choose Desktop & Screen Saver,
and click the Screen Saver button. You can deactivate the saver entirely (by
moving the Start Screen Saver slider to Never) or choose the Computer Name
saver (which is provided by Apple) from the Screen Savers list.
Step 10: Check for write-protection
If you’re running a multi-user ship, check to make sure that another user with
administrator access hasn’t accidentally write-protected your documents,
your application, or its support files. If possible, log in with an administrator
account yourself (as I describe in Book II, Chapter 5) and then try running the
application or opening the document that you were unable to access under
your own ID.
Trying an application under someone else’s account is also a great way to
determine whether your user-specific Preference file for that application
has been corrupted. If you can run the application using another person’s
account, contact the software developer to see how you can repair or
delete a Preference file that’s causing problems.
Step 11: Check your System Profiler
If you’ve reached this point in the troubleshooting process and haven’t
found the culprit, you’ve probably experienced a hardware failure in your
Macintosh. If possible, display the Hardware category within the Apple
System Profiler (see Figure 9-3) and make sure that it can recognize and use
Figure 9-2:

all the internal drives, ports, and external devices on your Mac. To start the
System Profiler, click the Apple menu, choose About This Mac, and then
click the More Info button.
Step 12: Reboot with the Mac OS X Installation Disc
In case your Mac is in sad shape and won’t even boot from its hard drive,
here’s a last step that you can take before you seek professional assistance:
Reboot your Mac from the Mac OS X Leopard Installation disc. Hold down
the C key immediately after you hear the startup chord (which boots your
system from the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive) and then run Disk Utility from
the Installation Apple menu that appears. Because you’ve booted the system
from the installation disc, you can verify and repair problems with your
startup hard drive. (Some new Mac models also come with a diagnostic
CD-ROM that can help you pin down hardware problems.) After you’re done,
restart your system.
Do I Need to Reinstall Mac OS X?
To be honest, this is a difficult question to answer. Technically, you should
never need to reinstall the Big X, but there’s also no reason why you can’t.
I can only think of two scenarios where reinstalling the operating system 
will likely solve a problem. One, if your system files have been so heavily
corrupted — by a faulty hard drive or a rampaging virus, for example — that
you can’t boot Mac OS X at all. Two, if the operating system encounters the
death-dealing kernel panic on a regular basis. A kernel panic displays a
dialog that instructs you to restart your Mac (in multiple languages, no less),
usually overwriting whatever’s on the monitor at the time. (This is analo-
gous to the infamous Windows Blue Screen of Death — I’ve grown to hate
that color of blue with a passion.)
Figure 9-3:
Use System
Profiler to

ports on

142
If you receive kernel panics on an ongoing basis, something is really, really
wrong. Make sure that your documents are copied to a rewriteable DVD or
network drive and don’t overwrite any existing backup that you have with a
new backup because the back-up application is likely to lock up as well.
To reinstall, you must reboot from your Mac OS X Leopard Installation disc.
Hold down the C key immediately after you hear your Mac’s startup chord.
(Read the earlier section, “Step 12: Reboot with the Mac OS X Installation
Disc.”)
It’s Still Not Moving: Troubleshooting Resources
As I mention earlier in this chapter, you can pursue other avenues to get
help when you can’t solve a troubleshooting problem on your own. Mind
you, I’m talking about professional help from sources that you can trust.
Although you can find quite a bit of free advice on the Internet (usually on
privately run Web sites and in the Internet newsgroups), most of it isn’t
worth your effort. In fact, some of it’s downright wrong. That said, here are
some sources that I do recommend.
The Mac OS X Help Viewer
Although most Mac OS X owners tend to blow off the Help Viewer when the
troubleshooting gets tough, that’s never the best course of action. Always
take a few moments to search the contents of the Help Viewer — click Help
from the Finder menu — to see whether any mention is made of the problem
that you’ve encountered.
The Apple Mac OS X Support site
Home to all manner of support questions and answers, the Mac OS X Support
section of the Apple Web site (www.apple.com/support) should be your
next stop in case of trouble that you can’t fix yourself. Topics include
✦Startup issues
✦Internet and networking problems
✦Printing problems
You can search the Apple Knowledge Base, download the latest updates and
electronic manuals, and participate in Apple-moderated discussion boards
from this one central location.
Your local Apple dealer
Naturally, an Apple dealer can provide just about any support that you’re
likely to need — for a price — but you can usually get the answers to impor-
tant questions without any coinage changing hands. Your dealer is also well
versed in the latest updates and patches that can fix those software incom-
patibility problems. Check your telephone book for your local dealer.

T
he Finder is the heart of Mac OS X — and we all know how heart surgeons
like to tinker, don’t we? (Ouch. Start again.)
The Finder is the heart of Mac OS X, and as you might expect, it’s highly con-
figurable. You can customize the Finder to present icons, or you can peruse
folders with a column view that can pack much more information onscreen
at one time. Some folks prefer the default Finder toolbar, and others like to
customize it with the applications and features that they use most often.
Decisions like these can help you transform Mac OS X into Your Personal
Operating System — and every Mac OS X power user worth the title will take
the time to apply these changes because an operating system that presents
visual information the way that you want to see it is easier and more efficient
to use.
No need for a hammer or saw — when you’re building the Finder of your
dreams, the only tool that you need is your mouse!
Will That Be Icons or Buttons or Columns . . . 
or Even a Flow?
The default appearance of a window in Mac OS X uses the familiar large-
format icons that have been a hallmark of the Macintosh operating system
since Day One — but there’s no reason why you have to use them. (In fact,
most Mac OS X power users whom I know consider the icon view mode

rather inefficient and slow.) Besides the icon view, as shown in Figure 1-1,
Mac OS X offers three other window view modes: list, column, and flow.
✦List view: List view displays the folders on the volume in a hierarchical
fashion. To display the contents of a folder, you can either click the right-
facing small triangle next to the folder name — it rotates downward to
indicate that you’ve expanded the folder — or you can double-click the
folder icon to display the contents in a Finder window. To collapse the
contents of the folder, click the small triangle again; it rotates back to
face the right. Figure 1-2 illustrates the same Finder window in list view.

You can resize a column by dragging the right edge of the column heading.
✦Column view: Figure 1-3 shows the same window in column view, in
which the volumes on your Mac OS X system are displayed on the left.
Each column on the right represents a lower level of subfolders. Click
the volume in the Devices list, then click the desired folder in the first
column on the right to display its contents, and so forth. (Personally,
this is my favorite view — thanks, Apple! It’s efficient and fast as all get-
out.) When you drill deeper, the columns shift automatically to the left.
When you click an item (instead of a folder), the Finder displays a pre-
view and a quick summary of the selected item in the rightmost column.
Each column has its own individual scroll bar (for those really, really big
folders), and you can drag the column handle at the bottom of the sepa-
rators to resize the column width to the left. When you hold down
Option and drag a column handle, all the columns are adjusted at once.
✦Flow view: When a new software feature or function turns out to be
incredibly popular, a developer tries to use it wherever possible —
hence the brand-new Flow view shown in Figure 1-4, which Apple took
directly from the Cover Flow view that proved so successful in iTunes.
Flow view still displays the sidebar, but each document or item is show-
cased in a preview pane (and with an accurate thumbnail, if possible).
You can resize the preview pane by dragging the three-line handle on the
bottom edge of the pane. The remainder of the Finder window in Flow
view works very similar to list view, complete with the rotating triangles.
However, if you like, you can click the scroll buttons or drag the scroll
bar under the preview pane to move through the contents of your drive
in a very classy visual display!

Doing the Toolbar Dance
148
Another of my pet peeves is cluttered disks. If you’re continually having
problems locating files and folders, ask yourself, “Self, do I need to organize?
Am I — gasp — cluttered?” If your answer is yes, take an hour and organize
your files logically into new folders. (Remember, I’m talking your documents
and such — not your applications, which are usually where they need to 
be — in your Applications folder.) Often, documents that you create end up
as stragglers, usually located in the root folder of your hard drive, which
sooner or later ends up looking like a biker bar after Ladies Night. (The same
can be said of many Mac OS X Desktops, too.) By keeping your root folder
and Desktop clean and saving your files in organized folders, you waste less
time searching for files and more time actually using them.
To switch between the three modes, click one of the three view mode but-
tons on the Finder window toolbar (the current view is highlighted) or click
the View menu and choose As Icons, As List, or As Columns. Mac OS X
places a helpful check mark next to the current view mode. (Keyboard lovers
can hold down Ô and press the 1, 2, or 3 keys to switch views.)
Doing the Toolbar Dance
You can work your customization magic on the Finder toolbar as well! In this
section, I show you how to customize that strip of icons across the top of
the Finder window that’s affectionately called the toolbar. Or, if you like,
you’ll discover how to dismiss it entirely to gain additional real estate for the
contents of your Finder window.
Hiding and showing the toolbar
You can toggle the display of the toolbar in an active Finder window in one
of three ways:

The status bar at the bottom of the Finder window displays a number of
helpful informational-type tidbits about the window’s contents. Depending
on what you’ve opened, the status bar can include
✦Statistics: See the number of items in the window and the amount of free
space remaining on the volume.
✦A write-protect icon: This icon looks like a pencil with a line running
through it, as shown in Figure 1-5. This indicates that you don’t have
write permissions for the contents of the window — or the volume
where the contents reside. (Note that this doesn’t necessarily mean that
folders at a lower level are write-protected as well.) You’ll typically see
this icon when you’re viewing the contents of a CD or DVD, where every-
thing is write-protected.

in the section “Configuring the View Options” in this chapter.
To toggle the display of the status bar, choose View from the Finder menu
and then choose Show/Hide Status Bar.
Giving your toolbar big tires and a loud exhaust
The default icons on the toolbar include
✦Back and Forward: Like a Web browser, clicking the Back button moves
you to the previous window’s contents. If you use the Back button, the
Forward button appears. Click this to return to the contents that you
had before clicking the Back button.
✦View: Click this control to toggle between the four view modes (icon,
list, column, or flow).
✦Quick Look: Click this control to display a window with the contents of
the selected file or document, without launching the corresponding
application. Quick Look works with all sorts of images, video, and docu-
ments, allowing you to efficiently peruse files on your system without
the hassle of constantly launching and quitting applications. Quick Look
works in any Finder window view mode, too. To activate Quick Look for
a selected file from the keyboard, press the spacebar.
While Quick Look is active, a number of format-specific buttons appear
at the bottom of the Quick Look window — for example, displaying an
image file in Quick Look adds a button that can automatically import 
the image into iPhoto. These buttons vary with the format or type of
document, but you’ll always see a full-screen/exit full-screen button that
toggles the Quick Look window between full-screen and regular size.
Pssst. Hovering over a folder and pressing the spacebar displays a summary
of its size and last modification date. Pass it on.
✦Action: Click this pop-up menu to display context-sensitive commands
for the selected items. In plain English, you’ll see the commands that
you’d see if you hold down Control and click the selection.
✦Search: Okay, I know it’s not technically an icon, but the Search box is a
member of the default toolbar family nonetheless. You can search for a
file or folder using this box — more on this later in the section
“Searching for Files from the Toolbar” in this chapter.
But, as one of my favorite bumper stickers so invitingly asks, “Why be
normal?” Adding or deleting items from the toolbar is a great way to cus-
tomize Mac OS X. Follow these steps:

1. From the active Finder window menu, choose View➪Customize
Toolbar to display the sheet that you see in Figure 1-6.
Along with controls like Back, Forward, and View, you find a number of
system functions, like Eject and Burn.
2. To add items to the toolbar, drag them from the Customize Toolbar
dialog up to the toolbar at the top of the window.
To add an item between existing buttons, drop it between the buttons,
and they obligingly move aside. If you get exuberant about your toolbar
and you add more icons than it can hold, a double-right arrow appears
at the right side of the toolbar — a click of the arrow displays a pop-up
menu with the icons that won’t fit.
In fact, the Customize Toolbar dialog isn’t necessary for some toolbar
modifications: You can also drag files, folders, and disk volumes directly
from the Desktop or other Finder windows and add them to your toolbar
at any time. To remove a file, folder, or disk volume from the toolbar, hold
down Control and click (or right-click) the icon on the toolbar; then click
Remove Item from the pop-up menu — it vanishes like a CEO’s ethics.
You can always drag a file or folder into the Sidebar column at the left of
the Finder window — the Sidebar column is a separate entity entirely
from the toolbar.
3. To remove an item from the toolbar, drag it off to the center of the
window, amongst the other icons.
4. Naturally, you can swap item positions. Just click an item, drag it to its
new spot, and then release the mouse button.

5. To choose the default toolbar configuration or to start over, drag the
default bar at the bottom of the window to the toolbar at the top.
This is the toolbar equivalent of tapping your ruby slippers together
three times and repeating, “There’s no place like home.”
6. To toggle between displaying the icons with accompanying text (the
default), the icon only, or a text button only, click the Show pop-up
menu at the bottom of the Customize Toolbar dialog.
7. After you arrange your toolbar as you like, click the Done button.
Searching for Files from the Toolbar
Need to find a file fast? The default toolbar has just what you need — the
Search field, which offers the ability to perform a Spotlight search for a string
of text within your files (including both filenames and contents). To locate a
file with the Search field, follow these steps:
1. Click in the Search box on the toolbar and type the text that you want
to find.
It’s the text box on the right with the magnifying glass. (The folks at
Apple are really, really into Sherlock Holmes . . . so am I!) If you need to
clear the field and start over again, click the circular X button, which
appears only when text is in the Search field.
Hey, who needs to press Return? The Finder immediately displays the
files with names that include the text, as shown in Figure 1-7.

2. To display the location of a file, click it once. To launch it, double-
click the entry.
Files can also be moved or copied from the Search results list with the
standard drag and Option+drag methods.
3. To perform a new search, click the circular X button and type new
text in the Search field.
To return to your original location in the Finder window, click the Back
button on the toolbar.
Searching for Files from the Find Dialog
Although the Search box on the toolbar is all that you’ll need to find most
files and folders, sometimes you need a little more flexibility and power to
locate what you need on your system. To do so, add the Find controls, which
you can use to create custom searches with more complex criteria. To locate
a file by using the Find controls, follow these steps:
1. With the Finder active, display the Find controls by pressing Ô+F (or
choose File from the Finder menu and then choose Find).
Mac OS X displays the controls that you see in Figure 1-8.
2. Click the buttons at the top of the list to specify where you want to
search.
You can choose Computer (your entire system, including network vol-
umes), a local volume, or your Home folder.
Figure 1-8:

controls add

3. To search for a specific filename, click the first pop-up menu in a row
and choose Name; then type all or part of the filename in the Contains
box.
Leopard automatically begins searching as soon as you type at least one
character.
After you locate the file or folder that you need, click the entry name to
reveal the location of the matching file or folder. You can also double-
click it to launch (or display) it.
4. If you want to search for a text string within the document itself, click
the first pop-up menu in a row, choose Contents, and then type the
string to match in the box.
The text must appear just as you’ve typed it, so it’s always a good idea
to restrict what you’re searching for to a minimum of words that you’re
fairly sure will cause a match. (Content searching is not case-sensitive,
though.) Content searching works only when you’ve generated an index,
which I explain later in this section.
5. To include additional search criteria lines, click the button with the
plus sign next to the last criterion line.
You can limit your results based on all sorts of rules, including the date
that the file or folder was last modified, when it was created, the file
type, the size, the extension, or whether the file or folder is marked visi-
ble or hidden (such as a system file).
You can also remove a search criterion line by clicking the button with
the minus sign.
6. To save the search criteria that you selected, click Save.
This creates a Smart Folder, which (you’re gonna love this) Leopard
automatically updates (in real time) to contain whatever items match
the criteria you’ve saved! You can specify the location for your Smart
Folder, and you can also choose to add it to your Finder sidebar for the
ultimate convenience. Sweet.
7. When you’re done canvassing your computer, click the Back button in
the Find dialog to return to the Finder.
Configuring the View Options
As I discuss at the beginning of the chapter, you’ve got a lot of control over
how Mac OS X presents files and folders in the Finder. In this section, I cover
how you can make further adjustments to the view from your windows.
(Pardon me for the ghastly cliché posing as a pun.)

Setting icon view options
First, allow me to provide a little detail on housekeeping in the Big X. After a
few hours of work, a Finder window in icon mode can look something like a
teenager’s room: stuff strewn all over the place, as I demonstrate with my
Applications folder in Figure 1-9. To restore order to your Desktop, right-click
(or Control-click) in any open area of the active window and then choose Clean
Up. This command leaves the icons in approximately the same position but
snaps them to an invisible grid so that they’re aligned, as shown in Figure 1-10.

Configuring the View Options
156
After things are in alignment, work with the icon view options. (Naturally,
you’ll want the active Finder window in icon view first, so choose View➪
As Icons or press Ô+1.) From the Finder menu, choose View➪Show View
Options — or press that swingin’ Ô+J shortcut — to display the View Options
dialog that you see in Figure 1-11. (Remember that these are the options avail-
able for icon view; I discuss the options for list and column view later in this
chapter. There are currently no view options available for flow view.)
Of course, Mac OS X remembers the changes that you make within the View
Options dialog, no matter which view mode you’re configuring. Now, the
changes that you can make from this dialog include
✦Resizing your icons: Click and drag the Icon Size slider to shrink or
expand the icons within the window. The icon size is displayed in pixels
above the slider.
✦Specifying grid spacing: Click and drag the Grid Spacing slider to shrink
or expand the size of the grid used to align icons within the window. The
larger the grid, the more white space between icons.
✦Resizing icon label text: Click the up and down arrows to the right of
the Text Size pop-up menu to choose the font size (in points) for icon
labels.
✦Moving icon label text: Select either the Bottom (default) or the Right
radio button to choose between displaying the text under your Desktop
icons or to the right of the icons.

✦Show Item Info: With this check box enabled, Mac OS X displays the
number of items within each folder in the window.
✦Show Icon Preview: If you enable this check box, the Finder displays
icons for image files using a miniature of the actual picture. (A cool feature
for those with digital cameras — however, this does take extra processing
time because Mac OS X has to load each image file and shrink it down to
create the icon.)
✦Arranging icons: From this pop-up menu, you can automatically align
icons to a grid within the window, just as if you had used the Clean Up
menu command. You can also sort the display of icons in a window by
choosing one of the following criteria from its pop-up menu: by name,
date modified, date created, size, item type, or the icon label you’ve
assigned.
✦Choosing a background: To select a background for the window, select
one of three radio buttons here:
• White: This is the default.
• Color: Click a color choice from the color block that appears if you
make this selection.
• Picture: Select this radio button and then click the Select button to
display a standard Open dialog. Navigate to the location where the
desired image is stored, click it once to select it, and then click Open.
✦Use as Defaults: When you first open the View Options dialog, the
changes you’re making apply only to the Finder window that opens
when you open the selected item — in other words, the item that
appears in the window’s title bar, like a folder or drive.
For example, any changes made to the settings in Figure 1-11 will affect
only my Applications folder because it was the active Finder window
when I pressed Ô+J. (You might have noticed that the window name also
appears as the title of the View Options dialog.)
However, you can decide to apply the changes that you make to all
Finder windows that you view in your current mode . . . simply click the
Use as Defaults button.
After all your changes are made and you’re ready to return to work, click the
dialog’s Close button to save your settings.
Setting list view options
If you’re viewing the active window in list view, choose View➪Show View
Options to display the View Options dialog that you see in Figure 1-12.

Configuring the View Options
158
Like in icon view, changes you make in this dialog normally apply only to
this window, but you can click Use as Defaults to assign these settings to all
windows that you view in list mode. The other list view settings include
✦Resizing your icons: You can choose from two sizes of icons.
✦Resizing icon label text: Click the up and down arrows to the right of the
Text Size pop-up menu to choose the font size (in points) for icon labels.
✦Show Columns: Enable the check boxes under this heading to display
additional columns in list view, including the date that the item was
modified, the creation date, the size, the item type, the version (supplied
by most applications), the label color, and any comments that you’ve
added in the Info dialog for that item. (In my personal opinion, the more
columns that you add, the more unwieldy the Finder gets, so I advise
disabling the display of columns that you won’t use.)
✦Use Relative Dates: Enable this check box to display modification dates
and creation dates with relative terms, such as Today or Yesterday. If this
freaks you out, disable this check box to force all dates to act like adults.
✦Show icon preview: Enable this check box to display preview icons for
image files. (Again, this takes extra processing time, and the image pre-
view icons are pretty doggone small in list view, so this feature may be of
limited value to you.)
✦Calculate All Sizes: Enable this check box to have Mac OS X display the
actual sizes of folders, including all the files and subfolders they contain.
(Handy for figuring out where all your disk space went, no?) Note: Using
this option takes processing time, so I recommend that you avoid using
it unless you really need to see the size.
To save your settings, click the dialog’s Close button.

Setting column view options
To make changes to view options in column view mode, choose View➪Show
View Options to display the View Options dialog that you see in Figure 1-13.
You only have five column view options, and any changes that you make to
this dialog are always reflected in every column view:
✦Resizing icon label text: Click the Text Size pop-up menu to choose the
font size (in points) for icon labels.
✦Show Icons: Enable this check box to display icons in the columns. If
this option is disabled, the icons don’t appear and you’ll gain a little
space.
✦Show icon preview: Click this check box to enable it, and Leopard dis-
plays preview icons for image files — taking a little extra time to perform
this service, naturally. (As you’ll find out in the next bullet, column
mode can be set to automatically display a preview thumbnail in the last
column when you click on an image or video file, and even some docu-
ments to boot . . . therefore, the usefulness of tiny icon previews in
column mode may be limited for you.)
✦Show Preview Column: If this check box is enabled, clicking a file in
column mode will display a thumbnail (reduced image) and preview
information in the right-most column, as shown in Figure 1-14.
If you store a slew of QuickTime movies and digital images on your
drive, the Preview column is great. (You can even play a QuickTime
movie from the Preview column.)

the item names displayed in each column, using name, date modified,
date created, size, item type, or the icon label.

Finally, you can change a number of settings to customize the Finder itself.
From the Finder menu, click Finder and choose the Preferences menu item to

In the General section, the preference settings include
✦Displaying Icons on the Desktop: Enable these check boxes to display
your hard disks, removable volumes (including CDs, DVDs, and iPods),
and connected network servers.
✦New Finder Windows Open: Click the pop-up menu to specify the spot
where a new Finder window should open. By default, a new window 
displays the contents of your Home folder.
✦Always Open Folders in a New Window: When this check box is
enabled, double-clicking a folder will open it in a new Finder window, as
did earlier versions of Mac OS. (If disabled, the contents of the folder
appear in the same Finder window, which makes it easier to focus on
just the folder you need at the moment.)
✦Open New Windows in Column View: When you enable this check box,
each new Finder window that you open automatically uses column view.
(If disabled, the new window uses the last view mode you used.)
✦Spring-Loaded Folders and Windows: It sounds a little wacky, but using
this feature can definitely speed up file copying! If this check box is
enabled, you can drag an item on top of a folder — without releasing the
mouse button — and after a preset time (controlled by the Delay slider) a
spring-loaded window appears to show you the folder’s contents. At that
point, you can either release the mouse button to drop the file inside the
folder (upon which the window disappears), or you can drag the icon on
top of another subfolder to spring it forth and drill even deeper.
The Labels preference panel is a simple one — just click next to each label
color to type your own text for that label. (I’ve gotta recommend red for
deadlines and green for contracts . . . call me sentimental.)
From the Sidebar preferences panel, you can choose which default items
should appear in the Finder window Sidebar column. Your choices include
locations (like your Home and Applications folders), network servers, remov-
able media, the Desktop itself, and — naturally — your hard drives. To add a
default item to the Sidebar column, select the corresponding check box to
enable it, or disable the check box to banish that item forthwith.
The Advanced preference settings include
✦Show All File Extensions: If this check box is enabled, the Finder dis-
plays the file extensions at the end of filenames, à la Windows. This
comes in handy for some applications, where everything from a docu-
ment to a preference file to the application itself all share the same icon.
However, I find extensions distasteful and leave things set with the
default of extensions off.

Setting Finder Preferences
162
✦Show Warning before Emptying the Trash: By default, this check box is
enabled, and Mac OS X displays a confirmation dialog before allowing
you to — in the words of Mac OS X patrons around the world — toss the
Bit Bucket. If you’re interested in speed and trust your judgment (and
your mouse finger), you can disable this setting.
✦Empty Trash securely: If you’d prefer to use the more secure method of
emptying your Trash — where deleted items are far harder for anyone to
recover — enable this check box.
✦Show Warning before Changing an Extension: Also on by default, this
setting forces Leopard to display a confirmation dialog before allowing
you to change the extension on a filename. Why? Well, changing an
extension usually results in a “broken” file association, so the file’s cor-
responding application may not launch automatically any longer when
you double-click the item — double-clicking a Word document, for exam-
ple, might not launch Word automatically as it used to do. If you show
file extensions and you often change them, click this check box to 
disable the warning.
After you make the desired changes to the Finder Preferences, click the
dialog’s Close button to save your settings and return to the Finder.

weak! Tweak!” It’s not the cry of some exotic bird — that’s the call of the
wild Mac Power User. Power users like to tweak their Mac OS X Desktops
just so, with that menu color, this background, and those applications in the
Dock. Non-computer types just can’t understand the importance of the
proper arrangement of your virtual workplace: When things are familiar and
customized to your needs, you’re more productive, and things get done
faster. In fact, if you’ve set up multiple users on your computer under Mac
OS X, the Big X automatically keeps track of each user’s Desktop and
restores it when that person logs in. (For example, when you use the Mac,
you get that background photo of Farrah Fawcett from the ’70s whereas
your daughter gets Avril Lavigne.)
In this chapter, I show you what you can do to produce a Desktop that’s
uniquely your own, including tweaks that you can make to the background
and your Desktop icons. I also show you how to use Desktop Stickies
instead of a forest of paper slips covering your monitor.
With your Mac OS X Desktop clad in the proper harmonious colors — yes,
that can be your favorite photo of Elvis himself — and your new Dock icons
ready for action, you’re indeed prepared for whatever lies ahead in your
computing world!
Changing the Background
You might be asking, “Mark, do I really need a custom background?” That
depends completely on your personal tastes, but I’ve yet to meet a computer

owner who didn’t change his or her background when presented with the
opportunity. Favorite backgrounds usually include
✦Humorous cartoons and photos that can bring a smile to your face (even
during the worst workday)
✦Scenic beauty
✦Photos of family and friends (or the latest Hollywood heartthrob)
✦The company logo (not sure it does much for morale, but it does
impress the boss)
If you do decide to spruce up your background, you have three choices: You
can select one of the default Mac OS X background images, choose a solid
color, or specify your own image. All three backgrounds are chosen from the
Desktop & Screen Saver panel, located within System Preferences (as illus-
trated in Figure 2-1).
You can also hold down Control, click the Desktop, and choose Change
Desktop Background from the pop-up contextual menu (or right-click, if
you’re using a mouse with multiple buttons or a trackpad with right-click
capability).

To choose a background from one of the collections provided by Apple, click

✦Apple Images: These default backgrounds range from simple patterns to
somewhat strange and ethereal flux shapes. (You have to see them to
understand what I mean.)
✦Nature: These backgrounds feature scenic beauty, such as blades of
grass, sand dunes, snowy hills . . . that sort of thing.
✦Plants: Close-up backgrounds of plant life — I especially recommend the
autumn leaves.
✦Black & White: Several truly stunning black and white backgrounds that
look especially good on a widescreen display. These are my favorite
images provided by Apple.
✦Abstract: These backgrounds have even weirder twisting shapes in flux,
this time with bright contrasting colors. Good for a psychiatrist’s office.
✦Solid Colors: This is for those who desire a soothing solid shade —
more on this in the following section.
✦Pictures Folder: This displays the images saved in the Pictures folder by
the active user.
✦Choose Folder: You can open a folder containing images and display
them instead. (I discuss this in more detail in a page or two.)
If you see something you like, click the thumbnail, and Mac OS X displays it
in the well and automatically refreshes your background so that you can see
what it looks like. (By the way, in the Apple universe, a well is a sunken
square area that displays an image — in this case, the background image
that you select.)
Notice your iPhoto albums in the list? That’s no accident — Leopard auto-
matically offers your iPhoto Photo Library so you can choose images from
your iPhoto collection!
How to annoy friends and confuse co-workers
Never let it be said that I can’t dish out revenge
when necessary. I don’t know whether I should
call this a Tip or a Devilish Practical Joke That
Will Drive People Nuts — anyway, it’s fun as all
get-out. Right before you go to lunch, use the
Grab utility in your Applications/Utilities folder
to take a snapshot of your Desktop with a
number of windows open (or an error dialog
with an OK or a Close button) and then save the
image to your Pictures folder. Select the image
as your Desktop background and then watch
others go crazy trying to click those faux win-
dows, buttons, and icons. For an archenemy, try
the same trick on his Mac! Arrange a slightly
embarrassing Desktop on his computer, specify
it as the background, and sit back while the fun
begins. (Perhaps a Web browser that’s open to
a somewhat unusual Web site?)

Changing the Background
166
Mac OS X automatically manipulates how the background appears on your
Desktop. If an image conforms to your screen resolution, fine — otherwise,
click the pop-up menu next to the well and you can choose to
✦Tile the background. This repeats the image to cover the Desktop. (This
is usually done with pattern images to produce a smooth, creamy, seam-
less look.)
✦Fill the screen. This can be used with a solid color to get uniform cov-
erage. The original aspect ratio of the image is preserved, so it’s not
stretched.
✦Stretch the background to fit the Desktop. If your Desktop image is
smaller than the Desktop acreage, this works, but be warned — if you
try to stretch too small of an image over too large a Desktop, the pixi-
lated result can be pretty frightening. (Think of enlarging an old Kodak
Instamatic negative to a 16 x 20 poster. Dots, dots, dots.) The original
aspect ratio of the image isn’t preserved, so you might end up with
results that look like the funhouse mirrors at a carnival.
✦Center the image on the Desktop. This is my favorite solution for
Desktop images that are smaller than your resolution.
Note that this pop-up menu appears only if the Desktop picture that you
select isn’t one of the standard Apple images. All the pictures in the Apple
Background Images, Nature, Abstract, and Solid Colors categories are scaled
automatically to the size of your screen.
To change your Desktop background automatically on a regular basis, enable
the Change Picture check box and then choose the delay period from the
corresponding pop-up menu. To display the images in random order, also
enable the Random Order check box; otherwise, Mac OS X displays them in
the order that they appear in the folder.
I just gotta have lavender
As I mention earlier, for those who want their favorite color without the
distraction of an image, one can choose from a selection of solid colors.
You can choose from these colors the same way that you’d pick a default
Mac OS X background image (as I describe in the preceding section).
Selecting your own photo
Finally, you can drag your own image into the well from a Finder window to
add your own work of art. To view thumbnails of an entire folder, click the
Pictures Folder (to display the contents of your personal Pictures folder) or
click the Add button (bearing the plus sign) to specify any folder on your
system. Click the desired thumbnail to embellish your Desktop.

Changing the Screen Saver
Screen savers are another popular item. Because I cover the Screen Saver pref-
erences in Chapter 3 of this mini-book, I simply illustrate here how to choose
one. Open System Preferences and click the Desktop & Screen Saver icon; then
click the Screen Saver tab to display the settings that you see in Figure 2-2.
To add a third-party screen saver module so that everyone can use it on a
multi-user system, copy it into the Screen Savers folder within the top-level
Library folder.
Click one of the entries in the Screen Savers column to display a thumbnail
of the effect. Enabling the Use Random Screen Saver check box, naturally,
runs through ’em all. You can also test the appearance of the saver module
by clicking the Test button; the screen saver runs until you move the mouse
or press a key.
Many screen savers allow you to monkey with their settings. If the Options
button is enabled (not grayed out), click it to see how you can change the
effects.
Changing Colors in Mac OS X
I can’t understand it, but some people just don’t appreciate menus with
purple highlights! (You can tell a Louisiana State University graduate a mile
away.) To specify your own colors for buttons, menus, and windows, follow
these steps:

Adding Stickies
Stickies are interesting little beasts — I don’t know their genus or phyla, 
but they’re certainly handy to have around. To be technical for a moment, a
Stickie is actually nothing more than a special type of application window, but
these windows remain on your Desktop as long as the Stickies application is
running.
I use Stickies for anything that a Post-it Note can handle, including
✦Reminders that you don’t want to misplace
✦Snippets of text that you want to temporarily store while your Mac is
turned off (without launching a behemoth like Word or digging for
TextEdit)
✦Boilerplate (repeated and standard) text that you’re constantly including
in your documents, like your address

✦A quick note that includes someone’s e-mail address or phone number
✦Today’s Dilbert cartoon from www.dilbert.com
A Stickie can contain data pasted from the Clipboard, or you can simply type
directly into the Stickies application window. Stickie windows can include
graphics and different fonts and colors. You can even locate specific text
from somewhere in your vast collection of Stickies by using the Find com-
mand within the Stickies application — just press Ô+F while the Stickies
menu is active to display the Stickies Find dialog. (And you don’t use up our
bark-covered friends of the forest, either.)
In Book I, I discuss the Mac OS X Services menu — you can make a Stickie
note from the Finder Services menu as well.
Follow these steps to stick your way to success:
1. Open your Applications folder and run the Stickies application to dis-
play the new window that you see in Figure 2-4.
The text cursor is already idling in the new window.
2. Type text in the window or press Ô+V to paste the contents of the
Clipboard into the window.
You can also import the contents of an existing file into a Stickie. Just click
File and then choose Import Text to display a standard Open dialog.
3. (Optional) Add text formatting, change text font, and change font
color from the Font menu.
From the Note menu, you can also choose to make the Stickie translucent.
(No pressing reason; they just look cool.)
4. To change the Stickie color, click the Color menu and choose the
appropriate hue.
5. Resize and drag the Stickie window to the desired location.
Press Ô+M to toggle between a miniaturized view (showing only the title
bar) and the expanded view.
To automatically run the Stickies application each time you log on, open the
Accounts settings in System Preferences and click your account in the list.
Click the Login Items button and add Stickies to the list by clicking the plus
button.
To delete a Stickie, simply click the Close button at the upper-left corner of
the Stickie window. Or, click the Stickie to make it the active note and then
click Close. Stickies display a dialog to confirm that you want to close the
note; click Save to save the contents in a file or click the Don’t Save button to
close the note and discard its contents.

Customizing the Dock
170
To close the Stickies application completely, click any note and press Ô+Q.
The application remembers the position and contents of each note until you
launch it again.
Customizing the Dock
In terms of importance, the Dock — the launch pad for applications and doc-
uments that appears on your Desktop — ranks right up there with the com-
mand center of a modern nuclear submarine. As such, it had better be easy
to customize, and naturally, Mac OS X doesn’t let you down.
Adding applications and extras to the Dock
Why be satisfied with just the icons that Apple places in the Dock? You can
add your own applications, files, and folders to the Dock as well.
✦Adding applications: You can add any application to your Dock by
simply dragging its icon into the area to the left side of the Dock. You’ll
know when you’re in the proper territory because the existing Dock
icons obligingly move aside to make a space for it.
Figure 2-4:
“Look, Ma,
it’s a
Stickie!”

Customizing the Dock
171
Attempting to place an application on the right side of the Dock sends it
to the Trash (if the Trash icon is highlighted when you release the
button or to one of the Stacks on that side of the Dock), so beware.
(More about Stacks in a second.)
✦Adding individual files and volumes: Individual files and volume icons
can be added to the Dock by dragging the icon into the area to the right
side of the Dock. (Attempting to place these to the left of the side of the
Dock opens an application with the contents, which usually doesn’t
work.) Again, the existing Dock icons will move aside to create a space
when you’re in the right area.
To open the Dock item you’ve added in a Finder window, press Control
and click the icon to display a Dock menu, where you can open docu-
ments, run applications, and have other assorted fun, depending on the
item you choose. (If your mouse has a right button, you can click that
instead of holding down the Control key.)
✦Adding several files or a folder: Leopard uses a new feature called
Stacks, which I’ll discuss in a few paragraphs, to handle multiple files or
an entire folder to the Dock.
✦Adding Web sites: You can drag any URL from Safari directly into the
area at the right of the Dock. Clicking that icon automatically opens your
browser and displays that page. (Safari gets the treatment in Book IV,
Chapter 5.) Now that, my friends, is genuine sassy!
To remove an icon from the Dock, just click and drag it off the Dock. You get a
rather silly (but somehow, strangely satisfying) animated cloud of debris, and
the icon is no more. Note, however, that the original application, folder, or
volume is not deleted — just the Dock icon itself is permanently excused. If
you like, you can delete almost any of the default icons that Mac OS X installs
on the Dock; only the Finder and Trash icons must remain on the Dock.
To set up a Dock icon as a Login Item — without the hassle of opening the
Accounts pane in System Preferences — just click a Dock icon and hold the
mouse button down until the pop-up menu appears. Then select the Open at
Login menu item.
If you can’t delete items from the Dock, you’re using a managed account —
that’s a standard user account with certain limitations set. (In this case, your
account is set to Some Limits, and your administrator has disabled the
Modify the Dock check box in your account.) You’ll need an admin-level user
to log in; then visit the Accounts panel in System Preferences and enable the
check box again. For more information on user accounts, see Chapter 5 of
this mini-book.

Customizing the Dock

Keeping track(s) with Stacks
I know, it’s a horrible play on words, but I’ve been waiting months to use it,
so my editors are doing me a favor.
Leopard introduces Stacks, which are groups of items (documents, applica-
tions, and folders) that you want to place on the Dock for convenience —
perhaps the files needed for a project you’re working on, or your favorite
game applications. For example, I have a Stack named Wiley on my Dock that
holds all of the project files I need for the book I’m currently writing.
To create a Stack, just select and drag the items you want to include to the
right side of the Dock — as always, the Dock opens a spot on the right side
of the Dock to indicate you’re in the zone.
To display the items in a Stack, just click it:
✦If the Stack holds relatively few items, they’re displayed in a really
cool-looking arc (as shown in Figure 2-5), and you can click the item you
want to open or launch.
✦If the Stack is stuffed full of many items, the Stack opens in a grid dis-
play, allowing you to scroll through the contents to find what you need.
Figure 2-5:
Click a

Dock to

contents.

Book II
Chapter 2

the Personal Touch
Stick It on the Dashboard
173
You can remove a Stack from the Dock by Control-clicking or right-clicking
the Stack icon — choose Remove From Dock from the menu that appears.
Alternately, just drag that sucker right off the Dock.
If you add a folder full of items, the Stack is named after the folder — otherwise,
Leopard does the best job it can in figuring out what to name the Stack.
(Although Apple makes a righteous attempt, I usually end up renaming the
Stack — right-click the Stack icon, or hold down Control while clicking the
icon, and you’ll see the Rename Stack menu item appear.)
Apple provides two Stacks already set up for you: the Download folder, 
situated to the left of the Trash, is the default location for any new files that
you download using Safari or receive in your e-mail. Leopard bounces the
Download Stack icon to indicate that you’ve received a new item. Next to 
the Download Stack, Apple has also parked a Documents Stack, which allows
you easy access to the contents of your user accounts Document folder.
Resizing the Dock
You can change the size of the Dock from the Dock settings in System
Preferences — I explain this in more detail in Book II, Chapter 3 — but here’s
a simpler way to resize the Dock, right from the Desktop.
Move your mouse cursor over the top edge of the Dock’s reflective base; the
cursor turns into a funky line with arrows pointing up and down. This is your
cue to click and drag while moving the mouse up and down, which expands
and shrinks the Dock, respectively.
You can also hold down the Control key and click when the funky line cursor
is visible. This allows you to change your Dock preferences without the
hassle of opening System Preferences and displaying the Dock settings.
Stick It on the Dashboard
One of Leopard’s most popular features is Dashboard, which you can use to
hold widgets and display them with the press of a button. (Okay, I know that
sounds a little wacky, but bear with me.) Widgets are small applications —
dubbed applets — that typically provide only one function. For example,
Dashboard comes complete with a calculator, a clock, a weather display, and a
quick-and-simple calendar. You can display and use these widgets at any time
by pressing the Dashboard key; by default, that’s F12, but you can modify the
key on the Exposé & Spaces pane within System Preferences. Leopard also
includes a thoughtful Dashboard icon on the Dock, which you can click to 
display your widgets. (Geez, that sounds kind of racy. Best not to pursue it.)
Figure 2-6 illustrates Dashboard in action. Press the Dashboard key, and the
widgets appear, ready for you to use. You can add or delete widgets to your
Dashboard by clicking the Add button (which bears a plus sign, naturally) at

Stick It on the Dashboard
174
the lower-left corner of the Dashboard screen. When you click the Add
button, a scrolling menu strip appears at the bottom of the Dashboard dis-
play, and you can drag new widgets directly onto your Dashboard from this
menu. It’s also easy to rearrange the widgets that are already populating
Dashboard by dragging them to the desired spot. Press the Dashboard key
again to return to your Leopard Desktop.
Most widgets have an option button that allows you to change things, such
as borders, zip codes, display columns, and the like; look for a tiny circle
with a lowercase letter i. Click this information icon and you can tweak what-
ever options are available for that widget.
To remove a widget, just click the Add button to display the menu strip, and
you’ll notice a tiny X button appears next to each widget on your Dashboard;
click the X button next to the widget you want to remove, and it vanishes
from the display. You can add it back again at any time from the strip.
While you’re adding or deleting widgets, you can also click Manage Widgets,
which displays a dialog where you can sort your widgets in a list by name or
date added, disable any widget, and delete a widget to the Trash (click the
red minus icon next to the offending widget in the list). Click the More
Widgets button to jump directly to the widget download area on the Apple
Web site.
Figure 2-6:

If you need to use a widget for only a second or two, press the Dashboard
key and hold it. When you release the key, you’re back to your Desktop.
Apple offers additional widgets that you can download on the Mac OS X
download site (www.apple.com/macosx). Third-party software developers
also provide both freeware and shareware widgets.
You can also modify the Dashboard key by turning it into a key sequence 
(a good thing if you’re already using an application that thrives on F12).
Visit the Exposé & Spaces pane in System Preferences, and use the Shift,
Control, Option, and Ô keys in conjunction with the Dashboard key to
specify a modifier.
Oh, did I mention that Leopard allows you to create your own Dashboard
widgets? That’s right, this new feature is sure to be a winner amongst the In
Crowd. Follow these steps to create a new WebClip Dashboard widget from
your favorite Web site:
1. Run Safari and navigate to the site you want to view as a widget.
2. Click the Open this page in Dashboard button on the Safari toolbar,
which bears a pair of scissors and a dotted box.
3. Select the portion of the page you want to include in your widget and
click Add.
Most Web pages use frames to organize and separate sections of a 
page, so this step allows you to choose the frame with the desired 
content.
4. Drag the handles at the edges of the selection border to resize your
widget frame to the right size and then click Add.
Bam! Leopard displays your new WebClip widget within Dashboard.
A WebClip widget can include text, graphics, and links, which Dashboard
updates every time you display your widgets. Think about that for a second:
Dynamic displays, like weather maps, cartoons, even the Free Music
Download image from the iTunes Store are all good sources of WebClip widg-
ets! (That last one is a real timesaver.)
If you click a link in a WebClip widget, Dashboard loads the full Web page in
Safari, so you can even use WebClips for surfing chores with sites you visit
often.
Arranging Your Precious Desktop
Consider the layout of the Desktop itself. You can set the options for icon
placement from the Finder View menu. Just like the options for Finder 

Arranging Your Precious Desktop
176
windows that I cover in Chapter 1 of this mini-book, you can clean up and
arrange your Desktop by name, date, size, or kind.
The View Options for the Desktop are different in two ways from the View
Options for a Finder window in icon view (which I discuss in Chapter 1 of
this mini-book):
✦You choose a background for the Finder from System Preferences.
✦You don’t have to worry about whether the options are global . . . you
have but one Desktop, after all!

L
ike the Mac OS 9 Control Panel before it, the System Preferences
window is the place to practice behavior modification in Mac OS X. The
settings that you specify in System Preferences affect the majority of the
applications that you use as well as the hardware that you connect to your
Mac; your Internet and network traffic; the appearance and activity on your
Desktop; and how Leopard handles money, dates, and languages. Oh, and
don’t forget your screen saver.
In this chapter, I discuss the many settings in System Preferences. You 
discover what does what and how you can customize the appearance and
operation of Mac OS X.
The Preferred Way to Display the Preferences
Apple has made it easy to open the System Preferences window. Just click
the System Preferences icon (which looks like a collection of gears, next to
the Apple logo) on the Dock, and the window shown in Figure 3-1 appears.
You can also open the window by clicking the Apple menu and choosing the
System Preferences item.
To display all the System Preferences panels at any time, click the Show All
button. You can also use the Back and Forward buttons (in the toolbar’s
upper-left corner) to move backward and forward through the different
panes you’ve accessed in System Preferences, just like the similar buttons in
a Web browser (yes, just like Safari!).
Although the System Preference panes are arranged by category when you
first install Leopard, you can also display the panes in alphabetical order —
making it easier to choose a pane if you’re unsure what group it’s in. To do
so, choose View➪Organize Alphabetically. (Note that you can also select
any pane directly from the View menu.)

Saving Your Preferences
178
Saving Your Preferences
Note that there’s no Save or Apply button on the System Preferences window.
Illustrating the elegant design of Mac OS X, simply quitting System Preferences
automatically saves all the changes that you make. (However, some panes in
System Preferences have an Apply Now button that you can click to apply
your changes immediately.) Like any other Mac OS X application, you can quit
the System Preferences window by pressing Ô+Q or by choosing System
Preferences➪Quit System Preferences.
Searching for Specific Settings
Searching for a single button or check box amidst all the settings in System
Preferences might seem like hunting for the proverbial needle in a haystack,
but your friends at Apple have added a Search box to the right side of the
window toolbar. Click in this Search box and type the setting name, like
screen saver (or even a word that’s generally associated with a setting, like
power for the Energy Saver settings). Leopard highlights all the icons in
System Preferences that have anything to do with the search keywords you
entered, as shown in Figure 3-2. You don’t even have to press Return!
Figure 3-1:

Hey, I got bonus icons in my window!
Some third-party applications can actually
install their own groups within your once-
pristine System Preferences window. For
example, I have icons for StuffIt, VirusBarrier X,
and Déjà Vu in my window. Naturally, I can’t
document these invited guests in this chapter,
but they work the same way as any other group
within System Preferences. Click the icon,
adjust any settings as necessary, and then
close the System Preferences window to save
your changes.

These settings are
✦Appearance: From this pop-up menu, choose a color to be used for but-
tons, menus, and windows.
✦Highlight Color: From this pop-up menu, choose a color to be used to
highlight selected text in fields and pop-up menus.
✦Place Scroll Arrows: Select either radio button here to put the scroll bar
arrow buttons together (at the bottom of the scroll bar, in the lower-
right corner of the window) or at the top and bottom of the scroll bar.
✦Click in the Scroll Bar To: By default, Mac OS X jumps to the next or
previous page when you click in an empty portion of the scroll bar. Mark
the Jump to Here radio button to scroll the document to the approxi-
mate position in relation to where you click. (You can also choose
smooth scrolling, which looks cool, but many folks think that it’s too
slow compared with the default scrolling speed.) If you enable the
Minimize When Double Clicking a Window Title Bar check box, you can
minimize a Finder or application window by simply double-clicking the
window’s title bar.
✦Number of Recent Items: The default number of recent applications,
documents, and servers (available from the Recent Items item in the
Apple menu, which you can read more about in Book I, Chapter 3) is 10.
To change the default, click any of the pop-up menus here and choose
up to 50. (Personally, I like 20 or 30 for each.)
✦Font Smoothing Style: Click this pop-up menu for choices to make the
text on your monitor or flat-panel appear more like the printed page.
The best choices are Standard (for a typical CRT monitor) and Medium
(for a typical flat-panel LCD display), or you can leave the setting at
Automatic and let Leopard select the optimum style.
✦Turn Off Text Smoothing for Font Sizes: Below a certain point size, text
smoothing isn’t much good for most onscreen fonts. By default, any font
displayed at 8 point or smaller isn’t smoothed, which is suitable for a
high-end video card and monitor. If you have an older monitor or a low-
end video card, you can speed up the display of text by turning off text
smoothing for fonts up to 12 point.
Desktop and screen saver preferences
Figure 3-4 illustrates the settings in the Desktop & Screen Saver group.
The settings on the Desktop tab are
✦Current Desktop Picture: You can click a picture in the thumbnail list at
the right half of the screen to use it as your Desktop background — the
Desktop is immediately updated, and the thumbnail appears in the well
(the square box in Figure 3-4). To display a different image collection or

open a folder of your own images, click the Add Folder button at the
lower left of the window (which carries a plus sign) and browse for your
heart’s desire; click Choose to select a folder and display the images it
contains.
✦Layout: As I explain in Chapter 2 of this mini-book, you can tile your
background image, center it, fill the screen with it, and stretch it to fill
the screen. (Note that filling the screen may distort the image.) The
layout control appears only when you’re using your own pictures, so
you won’t see it if you’re using a Desktop image supplied by Apple.
✦Change Picture: Enable this check box to change the Desktop background
automatically after the delay period that you set, including each time that
you log in and each time that your Mac wakes up from sleep mode.
✦Random Order: To display screens randomly, enable the Random Order
check box. Otherwise, the backgrounds are displayed in the sequence in
which they appear in the thumbnail strip.
Click the Screen Saver tab to see the following settings:
✦Screen Savers: In the Screen Savers list at the left, click the screen saver
that you want to display an animated Preview of on the right. To try out
the screen saver in full-screen mode, click the Test button. (You can end
the test by moving your mouse.) If the screen saver module that you
select has any configurable settings, click the Options button to display
them. (A screen saver is configurable if the Options button is enabled.)

✦Start Screen Saver: Click and drag the slider here to specify the period
of inactivity that triggers the screen saver. To disable the screen saver,
choose the Never setting at the far right of the slider.
✦Use Random Screen Saver: Just what it says — if this check box is
enabled, a different screen saver module is used each time that the
screen saver is activated.
✦Show with Clock: If you want your selected screen saver to display the
time as well, click this check box to enable it.
✦Hot Corners: Click any of the four pop-up menus at the four corners of
the screen to specify that corner as an activation hot corner (which
immediately activates the screen saver) or as a disabling hot corner
(which prevents the screen saver from activating). As long as the mouse
pointer stays in the disabling hot corner, the screen saver doesn’t kick in
no matter how long a period of inactivity passes. Note that you can also
set the Exposé activation corners from here. (For the scoop on Exposé,
see the upcoming section, “Exposé and Spaces preferences.”)
Dock preferences
The Dock group is shown in Figure 3-5.
Settings here are
✦Size: Move this slider to change the overall size of the Dock.
✦Magnification: With this check box enabled, a Dock icon magically
expands, like the national deficit, when you move your mouse cursor
over it. You can move the Magnification slider to specify just how much
magnification is right for you.

183
This feature is useful for helping you click a particular Dock icon if
you’ve resized the Dock smaller than its default dimensions or if you
have a large number of items on the Dock.
✦Springing: To enable the automatic drag feature within a Stack in the
Dock, enable the Springing check box and then choose a delay time
before the Stack springs open. With Springing enabled, you can drag a file
on top of a Stack, and after the delay period, the Stack automatically
expands.
✦Position on Screen: Choose from three radio buttons to make that crazy
Dock appear at the left, bottom, or right edge of your Desktop.
✦Minimize Using: By default, Mac OS X animates a window when it’s
shrunk into the Dock (and when it’s expanded back into a full window).
From the Minimize Using pop-up menu, you can choose from a genie-in-
a-bottle effect or a scale-up-or-down-incrementally effect. To demon-
strate, choose an effect and then click the Minimize button (the yellow
button in the upper-left corner) on the System Preferences window.
✦Animate Opening Applications: By default, Mac OS X has that happy,
slam-dancing feeling when you launch an application: The application’s
icon bounces up and down on the Dock two or three times to draw
your attention and indicate that the application is loading. If you 
find this effervescence overly buoyant or distracting, disable this
check box.
✦Automatically Hide and Show the Dock: If you like, the Dock can stay
hidden until you need it, thus reclaiming a significant amount of Desktop
space for your application windows. Enable this check box to hide the
Dock whenever you’re not using it.
To display a hidden Dock, move your mouse pointer over the edge of the
Desktop where it’s hiding.
You can also change these Dock preference settings from the Apple menu.
Exposé and Spaces preferences
Figure 3-6 illustrates the Exposé and Dashboard settings — and the Spaces
settings, which are new in Leopard — that you can configure in this group.
You can use Exposé to view all the application windows that you’re using at
one time, so you can select a new active window. Or, you can move all win-
dows aside so that you can see your Desktop. Dashboard presents a number
of mini-applications (or widgets), which you can summon and hide with a
single key. Spaces makes it easy to create multiple desktops that you can
switch between, each of which has its own set of pre-loaded applications.

Getting Personal
184
On the Exposé pane, the settings are
✦Active Screen Corners: These four pop-up menus operate just like the
Hot Corners/Active Screen Corners in the Desktop & Screen Savers
panel, but they control the operation of the Leopard Dashboard and
Exposé features. Click one to specify that corner as an All Windows
corner (which displays all windows on your Desktop), an Application
Windows corner (which displays only the windows from the active appli-
cation), a Desktop corner (which moves all windows to the outside of the
screen to uncover your Desktop), or a Dashboard corner (which displays
your Dashboard widgets). Note that you can also set the Screen Saver
Start and Disable corners from here.
✦Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts: Click each pop-up menu to set the key
sequences (and mouse button settings) for all three Exposé functions as
well as the Dashboard.
You’re not limited to just the keyboard and mouse shortcuts on the pop-
up menus — press Shift, Control, Option, and Command keys while a list
box is down, and you see these modifiers appear as menu choices! (Heck,
you can even combine modifiers, like Ô+Shift+F9 instead of just F9.)
On the Spaces pane (as shown in Figure 3-7), you find the following settings:

✦Enable Spaces: In order to use Spaces, enable this check box.
✦Show Spaces in Menu Bar: When this check box is enabled, Leopard dis-
plays the Spaces desktop number you’re currently using in the Finder
menu bar. You can click the number in the menu bar to switch to
another Spaces desktop or to open the Spaces Preferences pane.
✦Rows buttons: To add a row of Spaces desktops to the Spaces grid, click
the Add button with the plus sign. (By default, Spaces starts with two
desktops enabled, so new rows and columns are numbered beginning
with three.) To delete a row, click the Delete button (which bears a
minus sign).
✦Columns buttons: To add a column of Spaces desktops to the Spaces
grid, click the Add (plus) button. Click the Delete (minus) button to
remove a column from the grid.
If you choose to remove a column or row, Leopard alerts you that the
bindings on the deleted desktop(s) will be reassigned.
✦Add/Remove Application: Click the Add Application button (the button
with the plus sign under the Application Bindings list) to add an applica-
tion to one of your Spaces desktops. You can select which desktop
should include an application by clicking the up/down arrows next to
the Space column for that application’s entry — just click the desired
desktop from the pop-up menu that appears. To remove an application,
click it in the Application Bindings list to select it and then click the
Remove Application button (which sports a minus sign).

Spaces can even add an application to all your desktops — choose
Every Space from the pop-up menu.
✦Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts: Click each pop-up menu to set the key
sequences (and mouse button settings) for all three Spaces functions.
As with Dashboard and Exposé keyboard and mouse shortcuts, you can
press Shift, Control, Option, and Command keys while the box is open to
display modified choices.
International preferences
The International group appears in Figure 3-8 with the following tabs:
✦Language: Choose the preferred order for language use in menus and
dialogs as well as the standards that Mac OS X will use for each script
style.
✦Formats: Find these settings here:
• Dates: You can select a region and use its date conventions (month-
day-year versus day-month-year) or you can click the Customize
button to build a custom format for both the long date (Saturday,
September 24, 2005) and short date (9/24/2005) used throughout
Mac OS X. The changes that you make are reflected immediately in
the sample box at the left.
• Times: Click Customize to select a region to use the preset time con-
ventions. You can choose 12-hour or 24-hour (military) time formats,

change the time separator (colons, a period, or a dash), and specify
different suffixes for morning (a.m.) and evening (p.m.).
• Numbers: These convention settings determine the separators used
for large numbers or numbers with decimals, as well as the currency
symbol that you want to use and where it appears in a number. You
can also choose between standard (U.S.) and metric measurement
systems.
✦Input Menu: Each check box toggles the keyboard layouts available from
the Input menu. (To display the Input menu on the Finder menu bar,
click the Show Input Menu in Menu Bar check box to enable it.) Click the
Keyboard Shortcuts button to toggle the shortcuts for switching layouts
and input methods.
Security preferences
The Security group is shown in Figure 3-9.
Settings here are divided into three tabs:
✦FileVault: These controls allow you to set the master password for
FileVault encryption within the current user’s Home folder, which
makes it virtually impossible for others to access those files. Only an
admin-level user can set the master password. After the master pass-
word is set, you can click the Turn On FileVault button to enable
FileVault encryption for the user who’s currently logged in; the user’s
Login password becomes his FileVault password as well.

✦Firewall: As I discuss in Book IV, Chapter 6, Mac OS X includes a built-in
firewall, which you can enable from this pane.
To turn the firewall off entirely, click Allow All Incoming Connections.
This is the very definition of Not a Good Thing, and I always recom-
mend that any Mac hooked up to a network or the Internet have the
system firewall turned on.
To turn the firewall on without exclusions, click Block All Incoming
Connections — all network and Internet communications are
stopped. (I call this Extremely Nasty Mode, or ENM for short.) Of
course, your Mac can’t connect to your local network or the Internet,
which isn’t what you normally want either.
To turn the firewall on with exclusions, click Limit Incoming
Connections to Specific Services and Applications. (Yep, this is the
correct option for just about every Mac owner.) Any connection to a
service (like Personal Web Sharing) or an application (like iChat) that
isn’t listed is blocked.
In firewall-speak, these entries are rules because they determine what’s
allowed to pass through to your Mac.
It’s easy to enable communications with a service: Just use the Sharing
pane within System Preferences to turn on a service, and Leopard auto-
matically configures your firewall to allow communications. I describe
the Sharing pane in detail later in this chapter.
To add an application, click the button with the plus sign at the bottom
of the Firewall pane and then navigate to the application that needs to
communicate with the outside word. Click the application to select it
and then click Add. To delete an application, select it in the list and click
the button with the minus sign. Generally, you don’t have to add any of
the applications provided by Apple with Leopard, like Apple Mail, iChat,
or Safari — only third-party applications that you install yourself need a
firewall rule.
You can edit the rule for a specific service or application by clicking the
rule at the right side of the entry. By default, the rule reads Allow All
Connections (including both your local network and the Internet) —
however, when you click the rule, you can also choose Allow Local
Connections Only (which blocks all communication with the Internet, but
allows the Mac access to computers on your local network).
If you suddenly can’t connect to other computers or share files that you
originally could share, review the rules that you’ve enabled from this
panel. You can also verify that everything’s shipshape in the Sharing
pane in System Preferences, which I cover later in this chapter.
✦System: To add an extra layer of password security to a laptop (or a Mac
in a public area), enable the Require Password to Wake This Computer
from Sleep or Screen Saver check box — Mac OS X then requires that

Book II

you enter your login password before the system returns from a sleep
state or exits a screen saver. If you’re an admin-level user, you can set
the global security features in the For All Accounts on This Computer
section, which affect all user accounts. You can choose to disable the
automatic login feature, force Mac OS X to require a login password each
time that a System Preference pane is opened, automatically log off any
user after a certain amount of inactivity, or use secure (encrypted) vir-
tual memory on your hard drive.
Don’t want small fingers accidentally controlling your Mac with the
Apple Remote? If you don’t need the Remote on a regular basis, click the
Disable Remote Control Infrared Receiver check box to enable it. (But
don’t forget to turn your IR receiver back on for your next movie night!)
Spotlight preferences
The Spotlight group is shown in Figure 3-10.
Settings here are
✦Search Results tab: You can enable or disable the check boxes next to
each of the categories to display or hide each category in the Spotlight
search menu and dialog. Click and drag the categories to the order 
that you prefer. For example, I like to see matching documents immedi-
ately after matching applications in the Spotlight dialog, so I dragged
Documents to the second position in the list. You can also specify a 
different keyboard shortcut for the Spotlight menu and window.

✦Privacy tab: If you don’t want to display the contents of certain folders
in the Spotlight — for instance, if you work in a hospital setting and you
can’t allow access to patient information and medical records — click
the Add button (which carries a plus sign) and specify the folder or disk
you want to exclude from Spotlight searches. Alternatively, just drag the
folders or disks to exclude into the list from a Finder window.
It’s All about the Hardware
The next category, Hardware, allows you to specify settings that affect your
Macintosh hardware.
Bluetooth preferences
If your Mac has Bluetooth hardware available, the Bluetooth group, as
shown in Figure 3-11, appears. If you don’t have Bluetooth hardware, you’ll
be blissfully unaware of the existence of this group because the Bluetooth
icon won’t appear in your System Preferences window.
The choices on this pane include
✦Device listing: From this panel, you can opt to allow other Bluetooth
devices to discover your Mac and also whether you want to automati-
cally launch the Bluetooth Setup Assistant when no Bluetooth devices
are recognized. All recognized Bluetooth devices in range appear in the
list, and you can configure or disconnect them. You can also set up a
new Bluetooth device from here by clicking the Set Up New Device
button. And, if you like, Leopard can display a Bluetooth status menu in
the Finder menu bar.

MacBook owners who want to conserve power can disable Bluetooth
entirely . . . just click Turn Bluetooth Off, and you save a significant
amount of battery time!
✦Advanced sheet: Click the Advanced button to display another group of
settings. If you’re using a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard (as on an
iMac), you can wake your Mac using these devices. You can set Leopard
to alert you if an audio request is received from a Bluetooth device, and
you can share an Internet connection with connected devices.
You can also edit your Bluetooth Serial Ports from the Advanced sheet,
allowing you to use a Bluetooth connection as a virtual serial port —
you can add or remove serial services from the Serial Port sheet as well.
CDs and DVDs preferences
The CDs & DVDs group is shown in Figure 3-12.
Choices here are
✦When You Insert a Blank CD: Click this pop-up menu to specify the
action that Mac OS X takes when you load a blank CD-R or CD-RW. You
can choose to be prompted or to open the Finder, iTunes, or Disk Copy.
Additionally, you can open another application that you select, run an
AppleScript that you select, or ignore the disc.
✦When You Insert a Blank DVD: Use this feature to specify the action
that your Mac takes when you load a recordable DVD.
✦When You Insert a Music CD: Choices from this pop-up menu specify
what action Mac OS X takes when you load an audio CD. By default,
iTunes launches.
✦When You Insert a Picture CD: Choices from this pop-up menu specify
what action Mac OS X takes when you load a picture CD. By default,
iPhoto launches.
✦When You Insert a Video DVD: Choices from this pop-up menu specify
what action Mac OS X takes when you load a DVD movie. By default,
DVD Player launches.

Displays preferences
The Displays group is shown in Figure 3-13.
The two tabs here are
✦Display: Click the resolution that you want to use from the Resolutions
list on the left and then choose the number of colors (from the Colors
pop-up menu) to display. In most cases, you want to use the highest res-
olution and the highest number of colors. You can also choose a refresh
rate (from the, ahem, Refresh Rate pop-up menu). Again, generally the
higher the refresh rate, the better. Move the Brightness slider to adjust
the brightness level of your display. (Note that these settings are differ-
ent depending on what type of display you’re using. For example, a Mac
with a CRT monitor has more settings to choose from than a flat-panel
LCD system.)
Enable the Show Displays in Menu Bar check box if you’ll be switching
resolutions and color levels often — this means you, Ms. Image Editor
and Mr. Web Designer!
✦Color: Click a display color profile that will control the colors on your
monitor. To load a profile, click the Open Profile button. To create a
custom ColorSync profile and calibrate the colors that you see on your
monitor, click the Calibrate button to launch the Display Calibrator. (You
can also launch it from your Utilities folder within your Applications
folder.) This easy-to-use assistant walks you step-by-step through the
process of creating a ColorSync profile matched to your monitor’s
gamma and white-point values.

Energy Saver preferences
The Energy Saver group is shown in Figure 3-14.
The two tabs here are
✦Sleep: Move the Put the Computer to Sleep When It Is Inactive For slider
to specify when Mac OS X should switch to sleep mode. The Never set-
ting here disables sleep mode entirely. To choose a separate delay
period for blanking your monitor, drag the Put the Display(s) to Sleep
When the Computer Is Inactive For delay slider to the desired period.
You can also power-down the hard drive to conserve energy and prevent
wear and tear (an especially good feature for laptop owners).
If you want to start or shut down your Mac at a scheduled time, click the
Schedule button. Mark the desired schedule (the Start Up/Wake check
box and the Shut Down/Sleep list box) to enable them; then click the up
and down arrows next to the time display to set the trigger time. Click
OK to return to the Energy Saver pane.
✦Options: These settings can toggle events that can wake Leopard from
sleep mode, including a network connection by the network administra-
tor. If you want the display to dim before your Mac goes to sleep, enable
the Automatically Reduce the Brightness of the Display check box. You
can also set Mac OS X to restart automatically after a power failure,
which is a good idea if you’re running a Web or File Transfer Protocol
(FTP) server on your machine. (Read more about this in Book VII,
Chapter 4.) If you’re running a Mac laptop, click the Show Battery Status
in the Menu Bar check box to enable it.

Mac laptop owners can set two separate Energy Saver configurations:
✦Battery Power: Applies when their Mac is running on battery power)
✦Power Adapter: Kicks in when the laptop is connected to an AC outlet
You can also choose an Optimization mode, which is an easy way of
immediately setting your MacBook for better performance or best possi-
ble energy savings.
Keyboard and mouse preferences
The Keyboard & Mouse group is shown in Figure 3-15.
You’ll find anywhere from three to five panels in this group, depending on
whether you’re using a laptop Mac, and whether your Mac has Bluetooth
installed. The tabs include
✦Keyboard: Move the Key Repeat Rate slider to alter the rate at which a
keystroke repeats. You can also adjust the Delay until Repeat slider to
alter how long a key must be held down before it repeats. To test your
settings, click in the sample box and hold down a single key.
Laptop owners can set the F1–F12 keys for applications by enabling the
Use the F1–F12 Keys to Control Software Features check box — if you
enable this feature, you have to hold down the Function (or Fn) key
while pressing the F1 through F12 keys to use the regular hardware keys
(like F3, the audio mute key, or F6, the Num Lock key).
Figure 3-15:

If you have a MacBook Pro, you can choose to turn the ambient key-
board lighting on and off from this pane, or turn off keyboard lighting
after an inactivity delay that you set.
✦Mouse: Drag the Tracking Speed slider to determine how fast the mouse
tracks across your Desktop. You can also drag the Double-Click Speed
slider to determine how fast you must click your mouse to cause a
double-click — feel free to click in the sample box to test your settings.
Drag the Scrolling Speed slider to specify the rate at which the contents
of windows will scroll. Lefties might want to change the primary mouse
button for aftermarket pointing devices. You can also zoom the display
with your Mighty Mouse scroll ball while holding down the key of your
choice . . . a great option for image editing.
✦(Optional) Trackpad: This tab is available only to Mac laptop owners,
allowing this elite crowd to customize the tracking speed and double-
click speed for their trackpads. You can also set your MacBook’s track-
pad for two-fingered scrolling (vertical and horizontal) and two-fingered
zooming. (I imagine both will someday become Olympic events.) You
can also enable clicking and right-clicking by using the trackpad.
I suggest that you leave the Ignore Accidental Trackpad Input check box
enabled to prevent spurious movements and clicks — and, if you use a
mouse with your laptop, you can elect to disable the trackpad while the
mouse is connected. This helps to prevent accidental copies or moves
within a Finder window!
✦(Optional) Bluetooth: If you’re using a Bluetooth mouse or keyboard,
you can check the battery level on these devices from this panel. You
can also specify whether your Bluetooth keyboard or mouse wakes your
Mac from sleep mode. If you don’t have a Bluetooth card or external
adapter, this tab doesn’t appear.
✦Keyboard Shortcuts: If you’re a power user who appreciates the lure of
the keyboard shortcut, you can edit your shortcuts here.
Looking for even more keyboard customizing possibilities? Select the All
Controls radio button on the Keyboard Shortcuts panel to see additional
keys to use.
Printing and fax preferences
Figure 3-16 illustrates the Print & Fax preferences.
Click the Printer Setup button to configure the selected printer’s features,
and click the Print Queue button to display the Print Queue window (no
great shockers there). To add a new printer or fax connection, click the Add
button, which bears a plus sign — Leopard launches the Browser. You can
read more about printer and fax setup in Book VI, Chapter 4.

It’s All about the Hardware
196
The other settings here are
✦Default Printer: Click this pop-up menu to select the installed printer
that acts as the default printer throughout your system. If you choose
Last Printer Used, Mac OS X uses the printer that received the last
print job.
✦Default Paper Size in Page Setup: Will that be US Letter or Tabloid?
Click this pop-up menu to specify the default paper size for future print
jobs.
On the browser toolbar, click the Faxing button to set up the fax send/receive
functions built into Leopard. To receive faxes on your Mac, you must first set
up a fax connection, then click the Receive Options button and enable the
Receive Faxes on This Computer check box.
After faxing is turned on, you can configure the other settings from the Print
& Fax pane and the Receive Options sheet. These settings include
✦My Fax Number: Enter the phone number that others call to reach
your Mac.
✦When a Fax Arrives: You can determine how many times the phone
rings before your Mac answers the incoming call. By default, Mac OS X
saves the incoming fax to your Shared Faxes folder, but you can change
that location — or you can choose to print the incoming fax on the
printer that you specify. Heck, if you like, you can send your fax to both
destinations (a disk folder and a printer).
If you send and receive a large number of faxes, make sure you enable the
Show Fax Status in Menu Bar check box.

You can also allow other computer users on your local network to send faxes
through your Mac. Enable the Share this fax check box, and your Mac’s fax
modem appears when the other users add a fax connection.
Sound preferences
The Sound group is shown in Figure 3-17. To set the overall system audio
volume, drag the Output Volume slider. To mute all sound from your Mac,
enable the Mute check box. I recommend that you enable the Show Volume
in Menu Bar check box, which displays a convenient volume slider menu
bar icon.
The three tabs here are
✦Sound Effects: From this panel, you can choose the system alert sound
and the volume for alerts. You can also choose to mute application and
Finder menu sound effects, as well as toggle the sample sound effect
when the volume keys are pressed on your Mac’s keyboard (or from the
Volume slider). If you use Front Row with your Mac, you can enable or
disable the Front Row audio effects from this pane.
✦Output: Use these settings to choose which audio controller your Mac uses
for playing sound. Unless you’ve installed additional audio hardware, this
remains set to Built-in Audio or Internal Speakers. You can adjust the bal-
ance between the left and right channels for the selected output controller.
✦Input: These settings allow you to specify an input source. Unless your
Mac includes a Line In input source, leave this set to your Internal
Microphone. Drag the Input Volume slider to increase or decrease the
input signal volume; the input level display provides you with real-time
sound levels.

.Mac preferences
The .Mac group is illustrated in Figure 3-18.
The four tabs are
✦Account: In the .Mac Member Name and the Password text boxes,
respectively, type your .Mac member name and password to display the
Account tab. If you want to subscribe, click the Learn More button to
launch your Web browser — you’re whisked to the .Mac sign-up page.
For more information about joining Apple’s .Mac service, see Book IV,
Chapter 1.
✦Sync: If you want to synchronize your computer (or multiple Macintosh
computers) with the personal information and data stored online in your
.Mac account, enable the Synchronize with .Mac check box and click the
pop-up menu to specify manual or automatic synchronization. (To manu-
ally sync, click Sync Now.) You can also specify which categories of data
you want to sync. Naturally, the fewer categories you choose, the less
time it takes to sync. Leopard can display your Sync status in the Finder
menu bar.
✦iDisk: This tab displays your current iDisk usage and allows you to sub-
scribe for additional space with the Buy More button. You can set your
access privileges for your public folder to Read-Only or Read-Write, and

you can add a password that others have to enter before they can
access your public folder. For a complete description of iDisk, see Book
IV, Chapter 4.
I recommend that you click the iDisk Syncing Start button on the iDisk
tab to enable the Leopard iDisk syncing function (which creates a local
copy of your iDisk on your Mac). Select the Synchronize Automatically
option — it allows iDisk to run much faster because Mac OS X can read
and write by using your local iDisk copy on your hard drive. Your Mac
regularly synchronizes the data on your local hard drive across the
Internet with the iDisk on the Apple server.
✦Back to My Mac: From this list, you can control file and screen sharing
across all the computers you use with your .Mac account. To begin
using the Back to My Mac features, click the Start button. (Remember,
you’ll have to turn on Back to My Mac on all computers that will use
this service.)
Network preferences
The Network group is shown in Figure 3-19.
You can choose an existing Location by clicking the Location pop-up menu at
the top of the dialog, or you can create and edit your Locations by choosing
Edit Locations from this list. (Automatic is the default, and it does a pretty good
job of figuring out what settings you need.) As I mention in Book I, Chapter 3,
creating Locations makes it easy to completely reconfigure your Network pref-
erences when you connect your computer to other networks: for example,
when you take your laptop to a branch office. You can also set up Locations to
accommodate different ISP dialup telephone numbers in different towns.
Figure 3-19:

If you need to create a new Location that’s very similar to an existing
Location, click the Location pop-up menu and choose Edit Locations. Then
select the Location that you want to copy, click the Action button (bearing
the gear symbol), and choose Duplicate Location from the pop-up menu. The
new Location that you create contains all the same settings (without several
minutes of retyping), so you can easily edit it and make minor changes
quickly.
You can choose locations from the Apple menu — a useful trick for laptop
road warriors.
Built-in Ethernet network settings
When you select Built-in Ethernet from the Services list, the Status panel
shows your connection information. Because most networks have a DHCP
server to provide automatic settings, you probably don’t have to change
anything; Leopard does a good job at making introductions automatic
between your Mac and both a local network and the Internet.
Notice the very attractive Assist Me . . . button at the bottom of the Network
pane? It’s there for a very good reason: Click it, and Leopard launches a net-
work connection and troubleshooting wizard that guides you step-by-step. If
your ISP doesn’t provide you with instructions on setting up your Internet
connection — or that oh-so-smart Mr. Network Administrator is too busy to
help connect your Mac to your office network — use both this book and the
network wizard to do the job yourself!
Need to make manual changes to your network settings? Click the Advanced
button — consider it opening the hood on your car. The tabs on the Advanced
sheet include
✦TCP/IP: These settings are provided either automatically (by using
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [DHCP]) or manually (by using
settings provided by your network administrator). For more details on
TCP/IP settings, see Book IV, Chapter 1 and Book V, Chapter 2.
✦DNS: The settings that you enter here specify the DNS servers and
search domains used by your ISP. Typically, any changes you make here
are requested by your ISP or your network administrator. Click the Add
buttons (with the plus signs) to add a new DNS server address or search
domain.
✦WINS: Dating back a few years, WINS is a name server required for 
computers running NetBIOS (practically dinosaurs in the computer time-
line), and likely only those computers running a version of Windows
older than Windows 2000. If that sounds like gobbledygook to you, you
only need to enter something on this tab if instructed to do so by your
network administrator.

✦802.1X: This tab controls which wireless networking security protocols
that you may need to connect to a third-party wireless base station or
access point. Click the Add Configuration button (with our friend the
plus sign) to create a new wireless connection configuration, including
your username, password, and the protocols that need to be used. Note
that these settings are set automatically when making a wireless connec-
tion with an Apple Extreme base station.
✦AppleTalk: If you’re connecting your Mac to older Macs or AppleTalk net-
work printers via an AppleTalk network, enable the Make AppleTalk Active
check box and choose an active Zone to join from the AppleTalk Zone
pop-up menu. Automatic configuration works in nearly every AppleTalk
environment, but if you want to specify the Node ID and Network ID for
your computer manually, choose Manually from the Configure pop-up
menu.
Note that AppleTalk can be active on only one port within a location.
For example, if you have AppleTalk active for Ethernet, you can’t select
AppleTalk for the wireless port in the same location. (You can, however,
define different locations for AirPort and Ethernet, both with AppleTalk
active.)
✦Proxies: Network proxy servers are used as part of a firewall configura-
tion to help keep your network secure, but in most cases, changing
them can cause you to lose Internet functionality if you enter the wrong
settings.
Most folks using a telephone modem, cable modem, or digital subscriber
line (DSL) connection should leave these settings alone. Enable and
change these settings only at the request of your network administrator,
who should supply you the location of a PAC file to automate the process.
If you’ve enabled your Mac OS X firewall and you use FTP to transfer files,
enable the Passive FTP Mode check box on the Proxies tab. I recommend
that you enable this setting to allow downloading from some Web pages
as well.
✦Ethernet: From this panel, you can configure the settings for your
Ethernet network interface card. I strongly recommend that you leave the
Configure pop-up menu set to Automatically (unless specifically told to
set things manually by your system administrator or that nice person
from Apple tech support).
Modem network settings
When you select Modem from the Services list, you can enter the telephone
number, account name, and password provided by your ISP. In most cases,
that’s all the information you need . . . but if you need to make a manual
change, click the Advanced button to display these tabs:

Sharing the Joy: Internet & Network
202
✦Modem: Click the Modem pop-up menu and choose the brand and
model of your modem. If Mac OS X detects an internal modem, it’s used
by default.
I strongly recommend that you enable the Enable Error Correction and
Compression in Modem check box, and also select Wait for Dial Tone
before Dialing from the Dial Mode pop-up menu. These settings provide
you with the best performance and the fastest speeds.
You can also select tone or pulse dialing and whether you want to hear
the two modems conversing. (If the caterwauling bothers you, turn off
the Sound option.)
✦DNS: These settings are the same as those I cover earlier in the section
“Built-in Ethernet network settings.”
✦WINS: Again, you’re likely to never need these WINS settings, so 
make changes on this tab only if instructed to do so by your network
administrator.
✦Proxies: Some ISPs use proxy servers for their dialup accounts to main-
tain security, but changing these settings willy-nilly is inviting disaster.
Leave them disabled unless given specific instructions on what to set by
your ISP.
✦PPP: These settings are used for a Point-to-Point Protocol connection
over a telephone modem. Again, your ISP provides you with the right
values to enter here.
If you’re concerned about who’s using your Internet connection — or
you want to add an extra layer of security when you dial out — enable
the Prompt for Password after Dialing check box on the PPP tab, and
Mac OS X prompts you each time for your Internet account password.
I recommend that you enable the Show Modem Status in Menu Bar check
box on the Modem status panel, which gives you a visual reference on your
connection status.
Built-in FireWire and AirPort network settings
The Built-in FireWire and AirPort settings on the Advanced sheet are the
same as those for Built-in Ethernet that I cover earlier in this chapter.
However, three settings are on the AirPort status pane that I cover here:
✦By Default, Join: Leopard handles wireless connections automatically in
most cases — if possible, it connects to the last wireless network you
joined. If that network isn’t available or there are others to choose from,
Leopard displays a dialog asking you which available network you want
to join. If you want to join only one or more preferred networks (for
security or convenience reasons), click this pop-up menu, choose
Preferred networks, and then click the Add button to enter the wireless
network name and password.

✦Turn AirPort Off: Okay, here’s the honest truth — wireless networking
is a significant drain on a laptop battery! If you’re sure you’re not going
to use your MacBook’s AirPort network hardware in the near future, you
can click this button to activate and deactivate your Mac’s network
hardware. Turn off AirPort if you don’t need it, and your laptop will
thank you. (Just turn it back on using this same button when you need it
or use the AirPort status menu in the Finder menu bar.)
✦Show AirPort Status in Menu Bar: Hey, speaking of the AirPort Status
Menu in the Finder Menu Bar . . . enable this check box to display it! You
can immediately see the relative signal strength of your connection,
switch between available wireless networks, and turn off your AirPort
hardware to conserve your battery power (without digging this deep in
System Preferences).
QuickTime preferences
The QuickTime group is shown in Figure 3-20. For complete details on
QuickTime, streaming media, and viewing movies downloaded from the Web,
see Book III, Chapter 8.
If you’ve purchased a registration code for QuickTime Pro or Player Pro,
click the Register tab to enter it.
The other tabs here are
✦Browser: These settings determine how QuickTime acts when it’s used
as a Web browser plug-in. Enable the Play Movies Automatically check
box to toggle automatic playback of movies that you download from the
Web. If you view downloaded QuickTime movies often, enable the Save
Movies in Disk Cache check box — this improves the playback perform-
ance. Drag the Movie Download Cache Size slider to the right to dedicate
more hard drive space for movie caching.

Click the Instant-On button to enable or disable streaming playback the
moment that you start to receive the media (without queuing a signifi-
cant amount first, which takes time). The faster your Internet connec-
tion is, the less time you need to queue a media stream. Drag the delay
slider to adjust the time delay allowed for caching.
✦Advanced: If you’ve added a software-based music synthesizer (such as
Deck or VST) to Mac OS X, you can click Default Synthesizer to use it
instead of QuickTime’s built-in synthesizer.
If you receive protocol error messages from QuickTime, click the
Transport Setup pop-up menu and choose the Automatic setting. Mac OS
X chooses the correct transport protocol and port ID for your connection.
When the Enable Kiosk Mode check box is enabled, the options available
from the Player window no longer include the ability to save movies or
change QuickTime settings. This is a good idea when your kids are
downloading and watching movies from the Web.
QuickTime can play music from Web sites through the Adobe Flash ani-
mation format — to play this music, click the Enable Flash check box.
If you need to change the MIME file types that QuickTime plays from a
Web page, click the MIME Settings button. (These are the different types
of multimedia files that you encounter on the Web, like video, audio, and
photographs.) However, I recommend that you use the default settings
because otherwise you might end up downloading a file type that you
can’t use because you’ve disabled it.
Often, third-party media players will, in effect, take over the MIME file
types from QuickTime. Naturally, this is what you want, if you like the
new player application. However, if you decide that the new player isn’t
your style, you can return QuickTime to its rightful place as Kahuna of
the Web Downloads by displaying the MIME settings, clicking the Use
Defaults button, and then clicking OK.
If you play MP3 or MOV files that require secure media keys, you can
click the Media Keys button and enter the category and key. To edit a
key, select it from the list and click the Edit button. To remove a key
from the list, select it and click the Delete button.

Sharing preferences
Figure 3-21 illustrates the Sharing preferences.
Click the Edit button to change the default network name assigned to your
Mac during the installation process. Your current network name is listed in
the Computer Name text field.
Each entry in the services list controls a specific type of sharing, including
File Sharing (with other Macs and PCs running Windows), Web Sharing,
Screen Sharing, Remote Login, FTP Access, Remote Management (using
Apple Remote Desktop), Remote Apple Events, Xgrid, Internet Sharing,
Bluetooth Sharing, and Printer Sharing. To turn on any of these services,
enable the On check box for that service. To turn off a service, click the cor-
responding On check box to disable it.
From a security standpoint, I highly recommend that you enable only those
services that you actually use — each service you enable automatically
opens your Leopard firewall for that service. A Mark’s Maxim to remember:
Poking too many holes in your firewall is not A Good Thing.
When you click one of the services in the list, the right side of the Sharing
pane changes to display the settings you can specify for that particular
service. Note that some services may be disabled — for example, if you
don’t have Bluetooth hardware installed on your Mac, the Bluetooth shar-
ing service isn’t available.

Accounts preferences
The Accounts group is illustrated in Figure 3-22.
Each user on your system has an entry in this list. The panels and settings
here change, depending on the access level of the selected account. They
can include
✦Password panel: Click in these text fields to enter or edit the account
name, password, and password hint for the selected user.
Click the Address Book Card Open button to edit the card that you mark
in the Address Book as My Card. Mac OS X launches the Address Book,
and you can edit your card to your heart’s content. (For the complete
scoop on the Mac OS X Address Book, see Book I, Chapter 6.)
You can set a different .Mac account name and password for each user
account from this panel as well — if you’re sharing your Mac with a
number of other users, each person can set up their own .Mac account!
If you have administrator access, you can enable Parental Controls for
the selected user account or open the Parental Controls pane. (More on
Parental Controls later in this section as well as in Chapter 5 of Book II.)

✦Picture well: From the Picture well — the square area to the right of the
Account list — you can choose one of the thumbnail images provided by
Apple to represent you. Click the well to display the thumbnails. Click
Edit Picture to drag a new image from the Finder or take a video snap-
shot using your Mac’s iSight camera.
✦Login Items panel: The applications that you add to this list launch auto-
matically each time that the current user logs in to Mac OS X. To add an
application, click the Add button (which carries a plus sign), navigate to
the desired application and select it, and then click the Add button.
(Alternatively, you can simply drag an item from a Finder window into the
Login Items list.) To remove an application from the list, click to select it
and then click the Remove button (which has a minus sign). Each applica-
tion can be launched in a hidden state — its window doesn’t appear on the
Desktop. To toggle an item as hidden or visible, enable the Hide check box
next to the desired application. The order that Login Items are launched
can be changed by dragging entries in the list into the desired sequence.
Note that a user must be logged in to view and change the items on the
Login Items panel — even an Administrator-level user can’t access
another user account’s Login items!
You can even set up Login Items directly from the Dock! Control-click (or
right-click) the desired Dock icon to display the pop-up menu and then
click Open at Login.
✦Login Options panel: Look for the button with the little house icon,
lower left. Click it to set a number of global options that control how
users log in. For example, you can choose to display either a Name and
Password field on the Login screen (which means that the user must
actually type in the correct username) or a list of users, from which a
person can select a user ID. (If security is a consideration, use the Name
and Password option.) You can also add VoiceOver spoken interface
support at the Login screen, making it easier for physically challenged
users to log in to this Mac.
If you choose, you can log in automatically as the selected user by clicking the
Automatically Log in <Username> pop-up menu and choosing your account.
(Not a particularly secure feature for MacBook owners, but convenient as all
get-out.)
The Login Options panel also allows you to enable or disable Fast User
Switching (which I discuss in Book II, Chapter 5), and you can prevent
anyone from restarting or shutting down the Mac from the Login screen by
enabling the Hide the Restart and Shut Down Buttons check box.

Date and time preferences
Click the System Preferences Date & Time icon to display the settings that
you see in Figure 3-23.
The three tabs here are
✦Date & Time: To set the current date, click the date within the mini-
calendar; to set the system time, click in the field above the clock and
type the current time.
You can’t set these values manually if you use a network time server. To
automatically set your Mac’s system time and date from a network time
server, enable the Set Date & Time Automatically check box and then
choose a server from the pop-up menu that corresponds to your location.
(Of course, you need an Internet connection to use a network time server.)
✦Time Zone: Click your approximate location on the world map to choose
a time zone or click the Closest City pop-up menu and choose the city
that’s closest to you (and shares your same time zone).
✦Clock: If you enable the Show the Date and Time in Menu Bar check box,
you can choose to view the time in text or icon format. You can also
optionally display seconds, AM/PM, and the day of the week; have the
time separator characters flash; or use a clock based on 24 hours.
Personally, I get a big kick out of my Mac announcing the time on the 
hour . . . plus, it helps pull me back into the real world. (You have to eat
sooner or later.) Anyway, if you’d like this helpful reminder as well, enable
the Announce the Time check box on the Clock panel, and click the pop-
up menu to select an hour, half-hour, or quarter-hour announcement.

I discuss the Parental Control settings in detail in Chapter 5 of Book II. You
can use these settings to restrict a user’s access to certain applications, or
limit Mail and iChat communications to specific individuals. An administra-
tor can also switch a user account to the Simple Finder, making Leopard
much easier to navigate (and limiting the amount of damage a mischievous
or malicious user can inflict on your system).
Software Update preferences
The Software Update settings are shown in Figure 3-25. (Oh, and don’t forget
that you need an active Internet connection.)
The two tabs here are

• Settings tab: If you have more than one microphone, you can select
which one you want to use as well as set the input volume with the
Calibrate button. You can change the Listening key (Esc by default)
and specify whether your Mac should listen only while the key is
pressed or whether the Listening Key toggles listening on and off.
You can also change the name of your computer (using the Keyword
box) and whether that name is required before a command. From the
Play This Sound pop-up menu, you can indicate what sound effect
Mac OS X plays when it recognizes a speech command. (Optionally,
Leopard can confirm the command by speaking it if you enable the
Speak Command Acknowledgement check box.)
• Commands tab: Here you can select which types of commands are
available as well as whether exact wording of command names is
required. Click the self-named button to open the Speakable Items
Folder from this panel. Read more about these settings in Book VII,
Chapter 3.
✦Text to Speech: Here’s a fun panel. Click a voice from the System Voice
pop-up menu, and Mac OS X uses that voice to speak to you from dialogs
and applications. You can set the Speaking Rate (from Slow to Fast) and
play a sample by clicking the Play button. (Try Zarvox, Bubbles, and
Pipe Organ.)
The Announce When Alerts are Displayed feature actually speaks the
text within alert dialogs; to configure spoken alerts, click the Set Alert
Options button. You can optionally add a phrase before the text, which
you can choose from the Phrase pop-up menu. To add a phrase to the
list, like Don’t Panic!, choose Edit Phrase List from the list. Move the
Delay slider to specify how much time your Mac waits before reading
the dialog to you.
You can also optionally announce when an application wants your atten-
tion, and Leopard can speak the text that’s currently selected within an
application when you press a key that you specify.
This pane also provides a couple of convenient shortcut buttons that take
you to other “speech centers” within System Preferences — specifically, the
Date & Time and Universal Access panes.
Startup Disk preferences
Figure 3-27 illustrates the Startup Disk settings.
To select a start-up disk, click the desired start-up folder from the scrolling

icon if you want to boot from a System folder on your local network — 
typically, such a folder is created by your network administrator. If you’ve
set up a Windows partition on your hard drive using Boot Camp, the folder
appears with a Windows logo.
If you’re planning on rebooting with an external Universal Serial Bus (USB)
or FireWire start-up disk, that disk must be connected already, powered on,
and recognized by the system before you display these settings.
Click Target Disk Mode to restart your Mac as a FireWire external hard drive
connected to another computer. (This comes in especially handy when
you’re upgrading to a new Mac and you need to move files between the two
computers. I’ve also used it when the video card in one of my Macs decided
to stop working. This allowed me to make an updated backup copy of the
ailing Mac’s hard drive before I sent it off for repair.) You can also restart
your Mac and hold down the T key to invoke Target Disk Mode.
After you click a folder to select it, click the Restart button. Mac OS X confirms
your choice, and your Mac reboots.
Time Machine preferences
The Preferences pane shown in Figure 3-28 controls the automatic backups
performed by Leopard’s new Time Machine.
To enable Time Machine, click the On slider switch to enable it and then
click the Change Disk button to select a disk that holds your Time Machine
backup data. You have the option of encrypting your backup for extra secu-
rity, but remember that this slows down the backup and restore process
slightly.

Time Machine automatically begins a backup session whenever necessary
(working in the background). Depending on how much time remains until
the next backup, Leopard displays either the time remaining or the date and
time of the next backup.
Your Mac must be turned on to allow a scheduled backup to run!
By default, Time Machine backs up all the hard drives on your system —
however, you may not need to back up some hard drives or folders on your
Mac. To save time and hard drive space, Time Machine allows you to
exclude specific drives and folders from the backup process. Click the
Options button to display the Exclude list, and click the Add button (with
the plus sign) to select the drives or folders you want to exclude. The drives
you specify appear in the Do Not Back Up list.
To remove an exclusion, select it in the list and click the Delete button (with
the minus sign); note the Total Included figure increases, and Time Machine
adds the item you deleted from the list to the next backup.
Universal Access preferences
The final group, Universal Access, is shown in Figure 3-29. These settings
modify the display and sound functions within Mac OS X to make them more
friendly to physically challenged users. Note that if you select the VoiceOver
On radio button, Mac OS X speaks the text for all text and buttons onscreen.
If you have an assistive device that’s recognized by Mac OS X, select the
Enable Access for Assistive Devices check box to allow it to be used
throughout the operating system.

The four tabs here are
✦Seeing: These settings make it easier for those with limited vision to
use Mac OS X. You can toggle VoiceOver on and off from here; I discuss
more on this feature and these settings in Book VII, Chapter 3. To turn
on the display Zoom feature, select the Zoom On radio button or press
Ô+Option+8.
To specify how much magnification is used, click the Options button.
From the sheet that appears, you can set the minimum and maximum
Zoom magnification increments. From the keyboard, use Ô+Option+=
(equal sign) to zoom in and Ô+Option+– (minus sign) to zoom out.
Optionally, you can display a preview rectangle of the area that’s
included when you zoom. Mac OS X can smooth images to make them
look better when zoomed; click the Options button in the Zoom section
of the panel and enable the Smooth Images check box.
You can also determine how the screen moves in relation to the mouse
pointer from the Zoom Options sheet: By default, the zoomed screen
moves with the pointer, but you can set it to move only when the pointer
reaches the edge of the screen or maintain the pointer near the center of
the zoomed image automatically.
If you prefer white text on a black background, select the White on Black
radio button (or press the Ô+Option+Control+8 keyboard shortcut). Note
that depending on your display settings, it might be easier on the eyes to
use grayscale display mode by selecting the Use Grayscale check box.

sound volume in Mac OS X, you can click the Adjust Sound button to
display the Sound System Preferences settings, where you can drag the
Volume slider to the right.
✦Keyboard: These settings help those who have trouble pressing key-
board shortcuts or those who often trigger keyboard repeats (repetition
of the same character) accidentally. If you mark the Sticky Keys On radio
button, you can use modifier keys individually that are grouped together
automatically as a single keyboard shortcut. (You can optionally specify
that Mac OS X sounds a beep tone when a modifier key is pressed and
whether the modifier keys are displayed onscreen.)
Sticky Keys: A feature that allows you to press the modifier keys in a key
sequence one after another instead of all together can be toggled on
from the keyboard by pressing the Shift key five times. Turn Slow Keys
on to add a pause (of the length that you specify) between when a key is
pressed and when it’s actually acted upon within Mac OS X. You can
optionally add a key-click sound each time that you press a key. To turn
keyboard repeat off entirely, click the Set Key Repeat button, which
opens the Keyboard preference settings that I discuss earlier.
✦Mouse & Trackpad: With Mouse Keys active, you can use the numeric
keypad to move the mouse pointer across your screen. Mouse Keys can
be toggled on and off by pressing the Option key five times. Drag the
Initial Delay and Maximum Speed sliders to specify how long you must
hold down a keypad key before the pointer starts to move as well as
how fast the pointer should move across the screen. You can also dis-
able the trackpad on a Mac laptop when using Mouse Keys.
If you prefer a larger pointer, the cursor can be resized to make it easier
to spot onscreen. You can also click the Open Keyboard Preferences
button to turn on Full Keyboard Access or to remap keyboard shortcuts
for both the Finder and many applications.

hether you’re setting up Mac OS X for use in a public library or
simply allowing your 12-year-old to use your Mac in your home
office, configuring Leopard for multiple users is a simple task. However, you
must also consider the possible downsides of a mismanaged multi-user
system: files and folders being shared that you didn’t want in the public
domain, users logging in as each other, and the very real possibility of acci-
dental file deletion (and worse).
Therefore, in this chapter, I show you how to take those first steps before
you open Pandora’s Box — setting login options, configuring the personal
account that you created when you first installed the operating system, and
protecting your stuff. (Network administrators call this security check-up
locking things down. Better start using the terminology now, even before you
buy your suspenders and pocket protector.)
How Multi-User Works on Mac OS X
When you create multiple users in Mac OS X, each person who uses your
Macintosh — hence the term user — has a separate account (much like an
account that you might open at a bank). Mac OS X creates a Home folder for
each user and saves that user’s preferences independently from other users.
When you log in to Mac OS X, you provide a username and a password, which
identifies you. The username/password combination tells Mac OS X which
user has logged on — and therefore, which preferences and Home folder 
to use.
Each account also carries a specific level, which determines how much con-
trol the user has over Mac OS X and the computer itself. Without an account

How Multi-User Works on Mac OS X
218
with the proper access level, for example, a user might not be able to display
many of the panels in System Preferences.
The three account levels are
✦Root: Also called System Administrator, this uber-account can change
anything within Mac OS X — and that’s usually A Very Bad Thing, so it’s
actually disabled as a default. (This alone should tell you that the Root
account shouldn’t be toyed with.) For instance, the Root account can
seriously screw up the UNIX subsystem within Mac OS X, or a Root user
can delete files within the Mac OS X System Folder.
Enable the System Administrator account and use it only if told to do
so by an Apple technical support technician.
✦Administrator: (Or admin for short.) This is the account level that
you’re assigned when you install Mac OS X. The administrator account
should not be confused with the System Administrator account!
It’s perfectly okay for you or anyone you assign to use an administrator
account. An administrator can install applications anywhere on the
system, create/edit/delete user accounts, and make changes to all the
settings in System Preferences. However, an administrator can’t move or
delete items from any other user’s Home folder, and administrators are
barred from modifying or deleting files in the Mac OS X System Folder.
A typical multi-user Mac OS X computer has only one administrator —
like a teacher in a classroom — but technically, you can create as many
administrator accounts as you like. If you do need to give someone else
this access level, assign it only to a competent, experienced user whom
you trust.
✦Standard: A standard user account is the default in Mac OS X. Standard
users can install software and save documents only in their Home fold-
ers and the Shared folder (which resides in the Users folder), and they
can change only certain settings in System Preferences. Thus, they can
do little damage to the system as a whole. For example, each of the stu-
dents in a classroom should be given a standard-level account for the
Mac OS X system that they share.
If Parental Controls are applied to a standard account, it becomes a man-
aged account, allowing you to fine-tune what a standard account user
can do. (I discuss Parental Controls at length in Book II, Chapter 5.)
The Chapter 5 of this mini-book covers the entire process of creating and
editing a user account.

Configuring Your Login Screen
219
Configuring Your Login Screen
Take a look at the changes that you can make to the login process. First, Mac
OS X provides three methods of displaying the login screen:
✦Logging in with a list: To log in, click your account username in the list,
and the login screen displays the password prompt. Type your password —
Mac OS X displays bullet characters to ensure security — and press
Return (or click the Log In button).
✦Logging in with username and password: Type your account username
in the Name field and press Tab. Then type your password and press
Return (or click the Log In button).
✦Automatic Log In: With Automatic Log In set, Mac OS X automatically logs
in the specified account when you reboot. In effect, you never see the
login screen unless you click Log Out from the Apple menu. (Naturally,
this is an attractive option to use if your computer is in a secure 
location — like your office — and you’ll be the only one using your Mac.)
To specify which type of login screen you see — if you see one at all — head to
System Preferences, click Accounts, and then click the Login Options button.
✦To set Automatic Log In, display the Login Options settings and select
the Automatic Log In check box to enable it. Click the account name
pop-up menu and choose the account that automatically logs in. When
Working with the guest account
The guest account is a convenient method of
granting someone temporary access to your
Mac — in fact, your guest doesn’t even need a
password to log in! Your guest account has all
the attributes of a standard account, so the 
visitor has little chance of accidentally (or 
purposefully) damaging your system. However,
after the guest user logs out, the guest account
is “flushed” and all the data and files that
person created using the account are deleted
automatically. (This allows the next guest to
start with a clean slate.)
By default, the guest account is disabled. To
turn on this feature, open System Preferences,
click Accounts, and then click the Guest
Account entry in the list. (You may have to click
the Lock icon in the lower-left corner of the
Accounts pane and provide your admin pass-
word before you can continue.) Click the
Enable Guest Account check box to enable it.
Oh, and don’t forget that you can enable spe-
cific Parental Controls for the guest account,
just like any other account. That should come
in handy if your daughter has a slumber party
coming up this weekend . . . .

Configuring Your Login Screen
220
Mac OS X displays the user Name and Password sheet that you see in
Figure 4-1, type the corresponding password and then click OK.
Never set the Automatic Log In feature to an admin-level account unless
you’re sure to be the only one using your Mac. If the computer is rebooted,
you’re opening the door for anyone to simply sashay in and wreak havoc!
✦To determine whether Mac OS X uses a list login screen, you must again
visit the Login Options settings panel (see Figure 4-2). Select the List of
Users radio button for a list login screen or select the Name and
Password radio button for a simple login screen where you must type
your username and password.

Locking Things Down
221
To change settings specific to your account — no matter what your access
level — log in with your account, open System Preferences, and click
Accounts. From here, you can change your account password and picture,
the card marked as yours within the Address Book, and the Login Items
launched automatically when you log in. (Peruse more information on the
Address Book in Book I, Chapter 6.)
To log out of Mac OS X without restarting or shutting down the computer,
choose the Apple menu and then either choose Log Out or just press
Ô+Shift+Q. You see the confirmation dialog, as shown in Figure 4-3. Although
Mac OS X will display the login screen after two minutes, someone can still
saunter up and click the Cancel button, thereby gaining access to your stuff.
Therefore, make it a practice to always click the Log Out button on this
screen before your hand leaves the mouse!
You can also enable Fast User Switching from the Login Options panel. This
feature allows another user to sit down and log in while the previous user’s
applications are still running in the background. When you enable switching,
Leopard displays the currently active user’s name at the right side of the
Finder menu bar. Click the name, and a menu appears; click Login Window,
and another user can then log in as usual. (From the Login Options panel,
you can also choose to display the current user by the account’s short name
or the account icon.)
Even though you’re playing musical chairs, the Big X remembers what’s run-
ning and the state of your Desktop when you last left it. (When you decide to
switch back, Leopard prompts you for that account’s login password . . . just
in case, you understand.)
Locking Things Down
If security is a potential problem and you still need to share a Mac between
multiple users, lock things down. To protect Mac OS X from unauthorized
use, take care of these potential security holes immediately:
Figure 4-3:
Always click
Log Out

Starting Applications Automatically after Login
222
✦Disable the Sleep, Restart, and Shut Down buttons. Any computer can
be hacked when it’s restarted or turned on, so disable the Restart and
Shut Down buttons on the login screen. (After a user has successfully
logged in, Mac OS X can be shut down normally by using the menu item
or the keyboard shortcuts that I cover earlier.) Open the Accounts panel
in System Preferences, click the Login Options button, and enable the
Hide the Sleep, Restart, and Shut Down Buttons check box. Press Ô+Q to
quit and save your changes. (You can find more about restarting and
shutting down in Book I, Chapter 2.)
✦Disable list logins. With a list login, any potential hacker already knows
half the information necessary to gain entry to your system — and often
the password is easy to guess. Therefore, set Mac OS X to ask for the
username and password on the Login screen, as I describe earlier. This
way, someone has to guess both the username and the password, which
is a much harder proposition.
✦Disable Automatic Log In. A true no-brainer. As I mention earlier in the
chapter, Automatic Log In is indeed very convenient. However, all some-
one has to do is reboot your Mac, and the machine automatically logs in
one lucky user! To disable Automatic Log In, display the Accounts panel
in System Preferences and click the Login Options button; then disable
the Automatic Log in <username> check box.
✦Disable the password hint. By default, Mac OS X obligingly displays the
password hint for an account after three unsuccessful attempts at enter-
ing a password. Where security is an issue, this is like serving a hacker a
piece of apple pie. Therefore, head to System Preferences, display the
Accounts settings, click each user’s account in the list, and make sure
that the Password Hint box is empty.
✦Select passwords intelligently. Although using your mother’s maiden
name for a password might seem like a great idea, the best method of
selecting a password is to use a completely random group of mixed let-
ters and numbers. If you find a random password too hard to remember,
at least add a number after your password, like dietcoke1 — and no, that
isn’t one of my passwords. (Nice try.)
For even greater security, make at least one password character upper-
case, and use a number at the beginning and ending of the password. Or,
do the “c001” thing and replace characters with numbers, like the zero
that you insert in dietc0ke.
Starting Applications Automatically after Login
Here’s one other advantage to logins — each account can have its own selec-
tion of applications that run automatically when that user logs in. These
applications are Login Items. (For the Mac OS 9 old-timers, these are the
same as the Startup Items in days gone by.) A caveat or two:

Book II

Starting Applications Automatically after Login
223
✦The users setting their Login Items must be logged in. Only the user
can modify his or her own Login Items.
✦Users must have access to System Preferences. If the person is using a
standard-level account, it must allow access to System Preferences.
Ready? Let’s begin. Open System Preferences and click Accounts, click your
account to select it, and then click Login Items (see Figure 4-4).
Including an application in your Login Items list is easy: Click the button
with the plus sign to navigate to the desired application, select it, and then
click Add. (Alternatively, you can just drag items from a Finder window and
drop them directly into the list.) Note that items in the list are launched in
order — if something needs to run before something else, you can drag the
item entries into any sequence.
To launch the application in hidden mode — which might or might not dis-
play it in the Dock, depending on the application itself — click the list entry
for the desired item and enable its Hide check box.

 Configuring FileVault
 Avoiding keychains
I
n Chapter 4 of this mini-book, I introduce you to the different Mac OS X
multi-user account levels and the login process. If you’re ready to share
your Mac with others, you discover how to add new accounts and edit exist-
ing accounts in this chapter. Oh, and yes, I also show you how to frag —
that’s multiplayer game-speak for delete — accounts that you no longer
need. I also demonstrate how to add optional limitations to an individual
user account and how to avoid using a keychain (which is supposed to make
it easier to store that pocketful of passwords that you’ve created on the
Internet).
Yes, you read correctly. By all that’s good and righteous, Mac OS X actually
has a feature that I don’t want you to use. Read on to find out more.
Adding, Editing, and Deleting Users
All multi-user account chores take place in a single System Preferences
pane. (Cue James Bond theme song.) The Accounts pane is the star of this
chapter, so open System Preferences and click the Accounts icon.
If you haven’t added any users to your system yet, the Users list should look
like Figure 5-1. You should see only your account, which you set up when
you installed Mac OS X, set to administrator (admin) level.

Adding, Editing, and Deleting Users
226
Adding a new user account
To add a new user account, follow these steps:
1. In the Accounts pane in System Preferences, click the New User
button — which carries a plus sign — to display an empty user record
sheet that you see in Figure 5-2.
Figure 5-2:

227
If the New User button is disabled and you can’t click it, click the lock at
the bottom left of the System Preferences window and provide your
password to unlock the Accounts pane.
2. Select the access level for this user from the New Account pop-up 
list box.
By default, the user receives a standard level account. You can also
choose an Administrator account, or a Managed standard account with
Parental Controls already enabled.
3. In the Name text box, type the name that you want to display for this
account (both in the Accounts list and on the Login screen) and then
press Tab to move to the next field.
Mac OS X automatically generates a short name for use as your screen
and Buddy name in iChat and various network applications. The short
name is also the name of the folder that Mac OS X creates on the com-
puter’s hard drive for this user. You can keep the default short name or
type a new one, but it must not contain any spaces. For more on iChat,
jump to Book IV, Chapter 3. (I’ll wait for you here.)
4. Press Tab again.
5. In the Password text box, type the password for the new account.
Click the button with the key icon next to the Password field, and
Leopard is happy to display the Password Assistant, complete with a
suggestion. Click the Suggestion pop-up menu to see additional sugges-
tions. You can choose the length of the password and select from sev-
eral types: letters and numbers, numbers only, memorable, completely
random, or even government-quality. The Assistant automatically copies
the current password you’re considering to the Password text box.
As always, when you enter a password or its verification, Mac OS X 
displays bullet characters for security.
6. Press Tab, type the password in the Verify text box, and press Tab
again.
7. (Optional) If you decide to use the password hint feature that I
describe in Book II, Chapter 4, you can enter a short sentence or ques-
tion in the Password Hint text box.
The hint is displayed after three unsuccessful attempts at entering the
account password.

Adding, Editing, and Deleting Users
228
I recommend that you do not use this option. Think about it: Any hack
could type in anything three times to get your hint to pop up! If you do
use this option, at least make sure that the hint is sufficiently vague!
Press Tab to continue.
8. To automatically turn on the FileVault encryption feature for this new
account, enable the Turn On FileVault protection check box.
For more information on FileVault, see the sidebar later in this chapter
entitled, “So you like your privacy . . . .”
9. Click the Create Account button to finish and create the account.
The new account shows up in the Accounts list and in the Login screen.
Editing an existing account
If you have administrator access, it’s a cinch to make changes to an existing
account from the Accounts panel in System Preferences. (Often, this is to
assign a personalized account picture, so I demonstrate that here.) Follow
these steps:
1. Click the account that you want to change in the Accounts list.
Don’t forget, if the accounts in the list are disabled and you can’t select
one, you must unlock the Accounts pane. Click the lock at the bottom
left of the System Preferences window and type your password.
2. Edit the settings that you need to change.
3. Click the square Picture well to specify the thumbnail image that
appears in the Login list next to the account name.
Apple provides a number of good images in the preview collection —
just click a thumbnail to select it.
4. To add your own picture, click Edit Picture. You can drag a new image
from the Finder into the icon placeholder or click Choose to select
one from an Open File dialog; then click Set.
Alternatively, you can click the Take a Video Snapshot button to grab a
picture from your iSight or other video camera connected to your Mac.
Most cool.
5. After you make the changes (and you select just the right image to 
capture the user’s personality — a more difficult task than you might
think), press Ô+Q to save them and close the System Preferences
dialog.

Deleting an existing account
To wipe an account from the face of the Earth, follow these steps:
1. Click the account that you want to delete in the Accounts list.
2. Click the Delete User button (which is smartly marked with a minus
sign).
Mac OS X displays the confirmation sheet that you see in Figure 5-3.
Note that the contents of the user’s Home folder can be saved in a disk
image in the Deleted Users folder (just in case you need to retrieve
something). Alternately, you can choose to leave the deleted user’s
home folder as-is, without removing it.
If you’re absolutely sure you won’t be dating that person again, click the
Delete the Home Folder option (which doesn’t save anything in the
Deleted Users folder). You regain all the hard drive space that was being
occupied by the contents of the deleted user’s home folder.
So you like your privacy . . . .
These days, everyone’s interested in securing
their personal files from prying eyes. Granted,
this isn’t a problem if you’re the only one using
your Mac. However, if you’re sharing a com-
puter in a multi-user environment, you might
want a little more protection than just user per-
missions for those all-important Fantasy
Football formations that you’ll unleash next
season.
Never fear, Leopard offers a feature called
FileVault, which provides Home folder encryp-
tion that prevents just about anyone except the
NSA or FBI from gaining access to the files in
your Home folder. You can enable the FileVault
feature from the Security panel in System
Preferences. Two passwords control access to
your Home folder when FileVault is active:
 The Master Password can unlock any
Home folder for any user. Only someone
with an admin account can set the Master
Password. The Master Password must be
set before you can turn on the FileVault fea-
ture for any account on your system.
 Your Login Password unlocks your Home
folder.
Personally, I love this feature, and I use it on all
my Macs running Leopard. Yet, a risk is
involved (insert ominous chord here). To wit:
DO NOT forget your Login Password and make
doggone sure that your Admin user remembers
that all-important Master Password! Mac OS
X displays a dire warning for anyone who’s
considering using FileVault: If you forget these
passwords, you can’t retrieve any data from
your Home folder. Period. As Jerry Reed says,
“It’s a gone pecan.”

Administrators are special people. Just ask one; you’ll see. Anyway, when an
administrator creates or edits the account for a standard-level user, Mac OS X
offers a number of levels of specific rights — Parental Controls — that can be
assigned on an individual account basis. When an account has parental con-
trols assigned, it becomes a managed account.
Parental Controls are available only for standard-level users; administrators
don’t need them because an administrator-level account already has access
to everything covered by Controls.
When do you need Parental Controls? Here are three likely scenarios:
✦You’re creating accounts for corporate or educational users, and you
want to disable certain features of Mac OS X to prevent those folks from
doing something dumb. Just tell ’em you’re streamlining the operating
system. (Yeah, that’s it.) For example, you might not want that one par-
ticular kid making CD copies of The Illustrated Anarchist’s Cookbook in
the classroom while you’re gone. Therefore, you disable the ability 
for that account to burn CDs or DVDs.

✦In the same environment, you might want to give a specific standard-level
account the ability to administer printers. If Roger in Accounting is both
helpful and knowledgeable — oh, and add trustworthy in there, too — you
might want to give him this capability so that he can handle the print
queues while you’re on vacation.
✦You want one or more users to access one — and only one — application
on the system, or perhaps just two or three applications. To illustrate: In
my years as a hospital hardware technician, we had a number of com-
puters that were used solely to display patient records. No Word, no
e-mail, nothing but the one program that accessed the medical records
database. We called these machines dumb terminals although they were
actually personal computers. (This trick also works well if you’re a
parent and you want to give your kids access without endangering your
valuable files. Just don’t call your computer a dumb terminal lest your
kids take offense. That’s experience talking there.) If you want to allow
access to a specified selection of applications, you can set them in that
account’s Controls.
Setting Parental Controls
Time to review what each of the settings does. To display the controls for a
standard account, click the account in the list and then click the Parental
Controls tab. Leopard includes five different categories of controls, as shown
in Figure 5-4:

232
✦System: These settings (which I discuss in more detail in a second)
affect what the user can do within Leopard as well as what the Finder
itself looks like to that user.
✦Content: These settings control the Dictionary and Safari applications. If
you prefer that profane terms be hidden within the Dictionary for this
user, click the Hide Profanity in Dictionary check box to enable it.
Leopard also offers three levels of control for Web sites:
• Allow unrestricted access: Select this radio button to allow unfettered
access for this user.
• Try to limit access: You can allow Safari to automatically block Web
sites it deems adult. To specify particular sites that the automatic
adult figure should allow or deny, click the Customize button.
• Allow access to only these websites: Choose this radio button to spec-
ify which Web sites that the user can view. To add a Web site, click
the Add button (which bears a plus sign) — Leopard prompts you for
a title and the Web site address.
✦Mail & iChat: Click the Limit Mail and Limit iChat check boxes to specify
the e-mail and instant messaging addresses that this user can communi-
cate with. To add an address that the user can e-mail or chat with, click
the Add button.
Do you want a notification if the user is attempting to send an e-mail to
someone not in the list? Click the Send Permission Requests To check
box to enable it and then type your e-mail address in the text box.
✦Time Limits: Parents, click the Time Limits button, and you’ll shout with
pure joy — check out the options on this pane in Figure 5-5! You can
limit an account to a certain number of hours of usage per weekday
(Weekday Time Limits), limit to a specified number of hours of usage per
weekend day (Weekend Time Limits), and set a bedtime computer
curfew time for both weekdays and weekend days.
✦Logs: Leopard keeps a number of different types of text log files (which
track where the user goes on the Internet, which applications are
launched by the account, and the contents of any iChat conversations
where the user was a participant). From this central pane, you can moni-
tor all the logs for a particular account. Note that these logs are enabled
or disabled from other locations within Leopard: For example, the log
showing the Web sites visited and blocked is enabled from the Content
panel that I describe a little earlier whereas the applications log is
enabled when on the System panel. iChat logging is turned on from the
Preferences dialog within the iChat application.

You can always tell whether an account has been assigned Parental Controls
because the account description changes from Standard to Managed in the
Accounts list.
Of particular importance are the System controls. Click the System button to
modify these settings:
✦Use Simple Finder: I discuss the Simple Finder in the following section
because it’s a great idea for families and classrooms with smaller 
children.
✦Only Allow Selected Applications: When this option is enabled, you can
select the specific applications that appear to the user. These restric-
tions are in effect whether the user has access to the Full Finder or just
the Simple Finder.
To allow access to all the applications of a specific type — iLife, iWork,
Internet, Widgets, Other, and Utilities — click the check box next to the
desired group heading to enable it. To restrict access to all applications
within a group, click the check box next to the heading to disable it. You
can also toggle the restriction on and off for specific applications in
these groups; click the triangle icon next to each group heading to
expand the list and then either mark or clear the check box next to the
desired applications. To locate a specific application, click in the Search
box and type the application name.

234
To add a new application to the Allow list, drag its icon from the Finder
and drop it in the list within the Other group. After you add an applica-
tion, it appears in the Other group, and you can toggle access to it on
and off like the applications in the named groups.
✦Can Administer Printers: With this check box enabled, the user can
modify the printers and printer queues within the Print & Fax pane in
System Preferences. If disabled, the user can still print to the default
printer and switch to other assigned printers but can’t add or delete
printers or manage the Mac OS X print queue.
✦Can Burn CDs and DVDs: Disable this check box to prevent the user
from recording CDs or DVDs via the built-in disc recording features in
Mac OS X. (Note, however, that if you load a third-party recording pro-
gram, like Toast, the user can still record discs with it.)
✦Can Change Password: Enable this check box to allow the user to
change the account password.
If you’re creating a single standard-level account for an entire group of
people to use — for example, if you want to leave the machine in kiosk
mode in one corner of the office or if everyone in a classroom will use
the same account on the machine — I recommend disabling the ability
to change the account password. (Oh, and please do me a favor . . . don’t
create a system with just one admin-level account that everyone is sup-
posed to use! Instead, keep your one admin-level account close to your
bosom and create a standard-level account for the Unwashed Horde.)
✦Can Modify the Dock: Enable this check box, and the user can remove
applications, documents, and folders from the Dock in the Full Finder. 
(If you don’t want the contents of the Dock changing according to the
whims of other users, it’s a good idea to disable this check box.)
Assigning the Simple Finder
You can restrict your standard-level users even further by assigning them
the Simple Finder set of limitations. The default Simple Finder, as shown in
Figure 5-6, is a highly simplified version of the regular Mac OS X Finder. The
simplified Dock contains only the Finder icon, the Trash, the Dashboard
icon, and the folders for the user’s approved applications, documents, and
shared files.
This is the network administrator’s idea of a foolproof interface for Mac 
OS X: A user can access only those system files and resources needed to do
a job, with no room for tinkering or goofing off.
A Simple Finder user can still make the jump to the full version of the 
Finder — click Finder and choose Run Full Finder. The user has to enter a
correct admin-level username and password.

You can also change the Auto Login account from the Accounts panel. 
Click the Login Options button under the Accounts list and then enable the
Automatically Log In <username> check box to enable it. Click the pop-up
menu to choose the account that automatically logs in when Mac OS X starts
up. This is yet another good feature for those preparing a Mac for public 
use — if you set the Auto Login to your public standard-access account, 
Mac OS X automatically uses the right account if the Mac is rebooted or
restarted.
You can always choose Log Out from the Apple Menu to log in under your
own account. If you need to temporarily disable the Auto Login feature 
without changing which account it uses, disable the Automatically Log In
<username> check box.
Using Keychains — NOT
Before I leave this chapter, I want to discuss a Mac OS X feature that’s been
around since the days of Mac OS 9: the keychain. Your account keychain
stores all the username/password combinations for Web sites, file servers,
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers, and the like, allowing you to simply
waltz in and start using the service (whatever it is). Sounds handy, doesn’t
it? And it can be, but you better watch your step.
Figure 5-6:
Whoa! It’s
the Simple
Finder —
less filling,

great!

Using Keychains — NOT
236
I’m perfectly honest here: I hate account keychains. With a passion, mind
you. As a consultant, Webmaster, and the SYSOP (an ancient Bulletin Board
Service acronym meaning System Operator) of an Internet-based online
system, I know what a hassle it is for users to remember separate pass-
words, and I feel that pain. However, three massively big problems are inher-
ent with using keychains:
✦Anyone can log on as you. If your keychain is unlocked, which happens
automatically when you log in, all someone has to do is sit at your desk,
visit a site or connect with a server, and bam! They’re on. As you. Think
about that. And then think how many times you get up from your desk,
just for a second, to grab another Diet Coke or a doughnut.
✦You’ll forget your passwords. If the keychain file is corrupted — and it
can happen — your passwords have gone to Detroit without you. Either
you’ve got them on paper hidden somewhere, they’re on your recent
backup, or it’s time to change your online persona.
✦Keychains need yet another stinkin’ password. Yep, that’s right — your
keychain can be locked (either manually or, with the right settings, auto-
matically), and you have to remember yet another password/passphrase
to unlock your keychain. “When, oh when will the madness end?”
From a security standpoint, keychains should be completely off-limits for
anyone who’s interested in maintaining a well-locked-down machine. After
all, most folks can completely take care of all their Internet and network con-
nections with a handful of passwords, and that’s no big deal for anyone to
remember. Unfortunately, Leopard creates a keychain automatically for
every user, so you have to monitor (and delete) your keychain data manu-
ally. (Sigh.)
However, if you’re the only person using your Mac and it resides in your
home — personally, I’d prefer a bank vault — and you absolutely must use
keychains, you can display them all for the current account from the
Keychain Access application (see Figure 5-7), conveniently located in
Utilities within your Applications folder. Click the Category tab and then
click an item in the keychain list to display or edit all its information.
Heck, just think about what I just wrote — anyone can display and edit
server and site information just by launching this application! That includes
your nephew Damien — you know, the one who considers himself the hacker
extraordinaire. (While I’m at it, I should mention that it’s just as bad to set
the Auto Login feature — which I discuss earlier in this chapter — to an
admin-level account. One reboot, and you’re rolling out the red carpet for
the little rascal.)

To help lock things down — at least when it comes to your Internet 
communications — follow this path:
1. To display your Internet passwords, click the triangle icon next to the
Passwords category (upper-left) and then choose Internet.
2. Click each Internet password to select it in the list and then click the
lowercase i button at the bottom of the window to display the infor-
mation on that password.
3. Click the Access Control tab to display the settings that you see in
Figure 5-8, one of which I strongly recommend.
To minimize the damage that someone can do with this password, you
can enable the Confirm before Allowing Access radio button. And for 
yet another level of security, enable the Ask for Keychain Password
check box.
Of course, you’re probably thinking, “Well, Mark, that pretty much elimi-
nates the purpose of quick, convenient access without passwords, 
doesn’t it?” Yes, indeed it does, but at least your online identity is some-
what safeguarded.
Click the plus sign button at the bottom of the Keychain Access window
to add a new password. Type a name for the item, the username that
you typically type to gain access, and the password for that server or
site. Then click Add and cross your fingers.
Figure 5-7:

advice —

To display all the keychains you can access, choose Edit➪Keychain List. To
create a brand-new keychain, choose File➪New Keychain. Mac OS X prompts
you for the filename for your new keychain file. In the New Keychain dialog
that appears, enter a catchy name in the Save As text box. By default, the
keychain file is created in the Keychains folder — a good idea — but if you
want to store it elsewhere, click the down-arrow button next to the Where
list box and navigate to the desired folder. When you’re ready, click the
Create button. Now you need to enter yet another password, type it again to
verify it, and click OK.
To lock or unlock your login keychain, click the Lock icon at the top-left of
the Keychain Access window. (Unlocking your keychain requires you to
enter your login password. Go figure.)
You might be saying to yourself, “Geez, this guy is more than a little para-
noid.” And yes, dear reader, I suppose that I am. But then again, who’s been
uploading all those questionable images and MP3 files to the company
server . . . using your account?

Chapter 6: Sharing Documents 
for Fun and Profit
In This Chapter
 Comparing network sharing with multi-user sharing
 Setting and changing permissions
 Sharing documents in Microsoft 2004 for the Mac
N
ow here’s a topic that any Mac OS X power user can sink fangs into —
the idea that a document on a multi-user system can be everyone’s
property, allowing anyone in your family, workgroup, or highly competitive
mob to make whatever changes are necessary, whenever they like.
Of course, potential pitfalls lurk — even in the Apple world, there’s no such
thing as an operating system that’s both powerful and perfectly simple.
However, I think you’ll find that our dear friends from Cupertino have done
just about as well as can be expected and that the settings that you use to
share documents are fairly easy to understand and use.
Prepare to share!
Sharing over a Network versus 
Sharing on a Single Mac
First, allow me to clear up what I’ve found to be a common misconception
by using another of Mark’s Maxims.
Sharing documents on a single computer is fundamentally different from the
file sharing that you’ve used on a network.
True, multiple users can share a document over a network, which is a topic
that I cover in Book V. But although the results are the same, the way that
you share that same document on a single machine betwixt multiple users is
a completely different turn of the screw. In this section, I discuss the fac-
toids behind the matter.

Sharing over a Network versus Sharing on a Single Mac
240
No network is required
Although reiterating that no network is required is seemingly the most obvi-
ous of statements, many otherwise knowledgeable Mac OS X power users
seem to forget that sharing a document over a network requires an active
network connection. (Note the word active there.) Unless you physically
copy the document to your hard drive — which defeats the purpose of docu-
ment sharing — any loss of network connectivity or any problem with your
network account will result in a brick wall and a brightly painted sign read-
ing, “No luck, Jack.” (Or perhaps it’s flashing neon.)
On the other hand, a document shared on a multi-user Mac in the home or
classroom is available whenever you need it. As long as the file is located in
the Shared folder, the file privileges are set correctly, and you know the pass-
word (if one is used), then — as they say on Star Trek — “You have the conn”
whether your network connection is active or not.
Relying on a guaranteed lock
Sharing documents over a network can get a tad hairy when multiple users
open and edit the document simultaneously. Applications, such as Office
2004 for the Mac, have methods of locking the document (giving one person
exclusive access) when someone opens it or saves it. However, you always
face the possibility that what you’re seeing in a shared network document
isn’t exactly what’s in the document at that moment.
A multi-user system doesn’t need such exquisite complexity. You’re the one
sitting at the keyboard, and you have control: This is what network adminis-
trators call a guaranteed lock on that document file. Refreshing, isn’t it?
But wait! Mac OS X Leopard includes a feature called Fast User Switching — I
discuss it in Book I, Chapter 2 — that allows other users to remain logged in
behind the scenes while another user is at the keyboard. Therefore, if you
enable Fast User Switching, two users could have the same document open
at the same time. To prevent this, you can simply turn off Fast User
Switching from the Accounts panel in System Preferences. (Click Accounts,
click Login Options, and clear the Enable Fast User Switching check box.)
Most places are off-limits
Network users are often confident that they can blithely copy and move a
document from one place to another with the greatest of ease, and that’s
true. Most shared network documents created by an application — such as
a project outline created in Word, for example — carry their own sharing

Permissions: Law Enforcement for Your Files
241
information and document settings internally. Thus, you can move that same
file to another folder on your hard drive, and the rest of the network team
can still open it. (Um, if they have the network rights to access the new
folder, of course.)
This isn’t the case when it comes to multi-user documents. As you can read
in Chapters 4 and 5 of this mini-book, Mac OS X places a rather tight fence
around a standard-level user, allowing that person to access only the con-
tents of certain folders. In this case, your document must be placed in the
Shared folder for every standard-level user to be able to open it. If everyone
using the document has administrator access, you can store the file in other
spots on your system; as long as the permissions are set, you’re set. And
speaking of permissions. . . .
Permissions: Law Enforcement for Your Files
Files are shared in Mac OS X according to a set of rules called permissions,
the ownership of the file (typically the person who saved the document the
first time), and an access level specified as a group. The combination of privi-
leges, ownership, and group determines who can do what with the file.
When you (or the person with the administrator account on your Mac) cre-
ated your user account, you were automatically granted ownership of your
Home folder and everything that it contains as well as any files or folders
that you store in the Shared folder or another user’s Public folder.
Four possible actions are allowed through permissions:
✦Read Only: This action allows the user to open and read the file, which
includes copying it to another location.
✦Read & Write: This permission grants full access to the file, including
opening, reading, editing, saving, and deleting. Read & Write permission
also allows the user to copy or move the file to another location.
✦Write Only (Drop Box): A neat permission setting that appears only
with a folder — it allows access to copy an item to the folder, but not to
read any files it contains. (Hence the informal name Drop Box, and the +
[plus sign] icon added to the folder’s icon to identify it.) For example, a
drop box is made to order for teachers: Students can submit homework
by dragging their work to the teacher’s drop box.
✦No Access: This is just what it sounds like — the user can’t open the file,
copy it, or move it.

Permissions: Law Enforcement for Your Files
242
No matter what permissions you’ve set, only the System Administrator (or
root user) can copy items into another user’s Home folder. Take my word for
it on this one: Simply consider that this can’t be done, and stay as far away
from the Root/System Administrator account as possible. (Trust me on
this.) Read all about the perils of enabling the System Administrator account
in Chapter 4 of this mini-book.
These permissions are set in the Info dialog for a file or folder (always acces-
sible by pressing Ô+I). If you’re setting the permissions for a folder, you can
also elect to apply those same settings to all the enclosed items within the
folder.
To set permissions, follow these steps:
1. Click the item to select it, press Ô +I (or choose Finder➪File) and then
choose the Get Info menu item.
If you have a mouse or trackball with a right button, you can right-click
the item and choose Get Info instead. Either way, Mac OS X displays the
Info dialog.
2. Click the right-facing arrow next to the Sharing & Permissions head-
ing to expand it, as shown in Figure 6-1.
Because I selected a folder, the Apply Enclosed Items button appears at
the bottom of the section.

3. To change your own permissions on the item, click the You Can pop-
up menu and choose a new Ownership permissions level.
This is likely set to Read & Write, and it’s a good idea to leave it alone. If
you’re the file’s owner, you’re not likely a security risk.
Perhaps I should be a little less tactful here: Never choose an access
level for yourself other than Read & Write without being absolutely sure
of what you’re doing because you can potentially prevent yourself from
accessing or deleting the file in the future! For example, if you simply
want to lock an item to prevent changes being made, don’t set your
Ownership permission to Read Only. (Instead, select the Locked check
box in the General section of the Info dialog instead . . . you can easily
clear the Locked check box later to make changes to the item.)
4. To change permissions for someone else or a group, click the
Privilege value for that user or group and then choose the appropriate
value from the pop-up list.
Assigning permissions for an entire group is a good idea for limiting spe-
cific files and folders to only Administrator access. (Note, however, that
Leopard reserves the group name wheel for internal tasks, so never alter
any permissions for the wheel group.)
5. If necessary, set the permission for the Others pop-up menu (other-
wise known as “I’m going to lump everyone else into this category”).
If a user isn’t the owner of an item and doesn’t fit into any group that
you’ve selected, this access permission setting for this file applies to
that user.
If you’re setting permissions for a folder, Leopard can automatically
change the permissions for all the items contained in the folder to the
same settings. Click the Apply Enclosed button, and Mac OS X displays a
confirmation dialog.
Generally, it’s a good idea not to override the permissions for all 
the items in a folder, so click the Apply Enclosed button only when 
necessary.
6. After all the permissions are correct, click the Close button to save
your changes and return to your friendly Finder.
If a specific user or group doesn’t appear already in the Privilege list, click
the Add button (bearing the plus sign) and you can add a specific privilege
level for that user or group. You can also delete a privilege level: Click the
desired entry to select it and click the Delete button (which bears a minus
sign).

Permission and Sharing Do’s and Don’ts
244
Permission and Sharing Do’s and Don’ts
After you get the basics of sharing files and assigning permissions under
your belt, you need to master when to change permissions and why you
should (and shouldn’t) modify them. Follow these common-sense guidelines
when saving documents, assigning permissions, and choosing access levels:
✦Do use your Shared folder. The Shared folder is the center of proper
document sharing. I know there’s a strong urge to create a new docu-
ment in your Home folder, but you’re just making more work for yourself
because you’ll end up copying that document from your Home folder to
the Shared folder. Instead of an extra step, store a document that’s
intended to be shared in the Shared folder — where it belongs in the
first place.
✦Don’t assign permissions just to protect a file from deletion. Remember,
if all you need to do is prevent anyone (including yourself) from deleting
an item, you don’t need to go to all the trouble of changing permissions.
Instead, just display the Info dialog for the item and select the Locked
check box to enable it, which prevents the item from being deleted from
the Trash until the Lock status is disabled.
✦Do review the contents of a folder before changing permissions for
enclosed items. That confirmation dialog doesn’t appear just for kicks.
For example, if you set a highly sensitive, private document with permis-
sions of No Access for everyone but yourself and then you apply less-
restrictive permissions globally to the folder that contains the document,
you’ve just removed the No Access permissions, and anyone can open
your dirty laundry. (Ouch.) Therefore, make sure that you open the
folder and double-check its contents first before applying global permis-
sions to the items it contains.
✦Don’t change permissions in the Applications or Utilities folders. If
you have Administrator-level access, you can actually change the per-
missions for important applications like Mail, Address Book, iTunes, and
Safari, as well as their support files. This spells havoc for all users
assigned to the standard-access level. Be polite and leave the permis-
sions for these files alone.
✦Definitely don’t change System ownership. Mac OS X is stable and reli-
able. Part of that stability comes from the protected state of the System
folder, as well as a number of other folders on your hard drive. If you dis-
played the Info dialog for the System folder, you’ll see that the Owner is
set to system, and the Group is set to wheel (a term from the UNIX world
that encompasses all administrator accounts). Now, promptly close that
Info dialog, without making any changes!

245
✦Never, never, never change any permissions for any files owned by
the System unless specifically told to do so by an Apple support tech-
nician. Do not monkey with System-owned items.
This last one is quite striking for a reason, so heed the warning.
Sharing Stuff in Office 2004
Many Mac OS X applications offer their own built-in document-sharing fea-
tures. For example, Microsoft Office 2004 for the Mac includes both file-level
and document-sharing features. Because Office 2004 is the most popular pro-
ductivity suite available for Mac OS X, I discuss these commands in this final
section.
Document-sharing features
You’ll find a number of commands that help multiple users keep track of
changes that have been made in a shared Office document. Probably the
most familiar is the Word revision tracking features (heavily used during the
development of this book), but there are others as well:
✦Revision marks: If several users edit a document, how can you tell who
did what? By using revision marks, which apply different colors to
changes made by different editors, those additions and deletions can be
accepted or rejected individually at a later date. If Johnson in Marketing
adds incorrect material, you can easily remove just his changes. In a
worst-case scenario, you can actually reject all changes and return the
document to its pristine condition.
✦Compare Documents: Using this feature allows you to compare a
revised document with the original (if, of course, you still have the origi-
nal file handy). I use Compare Documents only if revision marks weren’t
turned on before editing began.
✦Comments: Editors can also converse within a document by using
embedded Comments. These don’t change the contents of the Word file
like revision marks do but store commentary and notes in a behind-the-
scenes kind of way. (Think of a Mac OS X Stickie that appears within a
document.) Again, the author of each comment is listed, allowing for
(sometimes heated) communication within the body of a document.
✦Highlighting: You’ve heard the old joke about. . . . Well, anyway, a tradi-
tional highlighter marker is pretty useless on a computer monitor (leav-
ing a nasty mess for the next user to clean), but Word allows multiple
highlighting colors for identifying text. (And for the occasional practical
joke — nothing like adding eight different highlighting colors to that
important proposal. Just make sure that your résumé is up-to-date.)

Sharing Stuff in Office 2004
246
File-level sharing features
Along with the document-level sharing commands, you’ll also find that Office
2004 applications also offer sharing features that control access to the docu-
ment file itself.
Password protection
You can add password protection to any Office 2004 document. Follow these
steps with a document created within Word, Excel, or PowerPoint:
1. Choose File➪Save As.
2. In the Save As dialog that appears, click Options to display the Save
Preferences panel.
3. Click Security to display the Preferences panel that you see in 
Figure 6-2.
4. To password-protect the document, enter a password in the Password
to Open field.
This password must be provided when opening the document.
If you like, you can enter another password in the Password to Modify
field. This second password would then also be required to modify the
document.
Both passwords are case-sensitive.
5. Click OK to save the preference changes and return to your document.

passwords.

Versions
If you like, Word can save multiple versions of a document in a single file.
Each version is identified by the date and time when it was saved, the user
who saved it, and an additional comments line. Choose File➪Versions to dis-
play the Versions dialog, from which you can choose to automatically save a
new version of the document whenever it’s closed. To save a new version
immediately, click the Save Now button.
Document protection
Think of the Protect Document dialog in Word, from which you can effec-
tively write-protect certain elements, as an extra level of security in a multi-
user environment. In this Office application, you can protect revision marks,
comments, and sections of a document containing forms. A password can be
added if desired. To display the Protect Document dialog, click Tools in any
of the Office 2004 applications and choose Protect Document from the pop-
up menu that appears.

 Doing things the hub way
 Digitizing your life
 Making your digital devices work together
H
uzzah! After years of empty promises of professional-quality media fea-
tures for home and school — most of them coming from that silly
Gates person in Redmond — Apple has taken on the challenge and devel-
oped a recipe for digital success.
By using tightly integrated hardware and software (where everything works
smoothly together), Apple gives you the ability to easily organize and pro-
duce your own multimedia with the iLife suite of digital tools, which
includes iMovie, iDVD, iPhoto, GarageBand, iWeb, and iTunes. That same
software also provides fantastic editing capabilities. Finally (and this is very
important) — to paraphrase Will Smith in the movie Men in Black, “Apple
makes these programs look good.”
First, Sliced Bread . . . and Now, the Digital Hub
In today’s overloaded world of personal electronic devices, people can try
to juggle as many as five or six electronic wonders. Each device typically
comes with its own software, power adapter, and connectors to the outside
world. Although managing one or two devices isn’t terribly difficult, as the
number of devices increases, so do the headaches. When you have a half-
dozen cables, power adapters, and software to cart around, the digital life
can become pretty bleak. (And quite heavy. You’ll need more than a back-
pack to lug all that gear around.)

What Does Digital Mean, Anyway?
252
To combat this confusion, Apple came up with the idea of a digital hub,
whereby your Macintosh acts as the center of an array of electronic devices.
By using standardized cables, power requirements, built-in software, and
even wireless connections via Bluetooth (the standard for short-range wire-
less communications between devices) and 802.11x wireless (for connec-
tions to your Ethernet network and your Apple TV unit), the Macintosh —
along with its operating system, Mac OS X — goes a long way toward simpli-
fying your interaction with all the electronic gadgets that you use.
Given the hub terminology, think of the digital hub as a wagon wheel. (See
Figure 1-1.) At the center of the wheel is your Macintosh. At the end of each
spoke is a digital device. Throughout the rest of Book III, I give you the
skinny on each device, but this chapter gives you the overview and tells you
how they all work together.
What Does Digital Mean, Anyway?
Computers are handy machines. They can process information very quickly
and never get bored when asked to do the same task millions of times. The
problem is that despite their propensity for reliability and speed, they aren’t
Figure 1-1:
Hey, look
what’s in 
the center

digital hub!

so hot in the intuition department. You have to tell them how to do every-
thing (and most of them only talk to application developers and program-
mers). Computers know only one thing — numbers — although they do
know numbers very, very well.
In fact, binary (the language of computers) has only two values — one and
zero, which represent on and off, respectively. (Think of a light switch that
toggles: The earliest computers were simply banks of switches that filled up
an entire room.) To work with a computer in meaningful ways, you have to
describe everything to a computer with numbers — or, if you prefer, digits.
By describing audio in numerical digits, you suddenly have something that a
computer can work with. Toss a computer as many numbers as you want,
and it can handle them. The scientists who figured this out knew that they
had a good thing going, so they proceeded to convert anything that they
could get their hands on into . . . well . . . digits. (Sorry about the atrocious
pun.) Anyway, this resulted in some interesting technologies, most of which
you’ll surely recognize:
✦Audio CDs: The music is represented as numbers and is stored on a
plastic disc.
✦Digital video: Images and sound are stored together on your hard drive
or a DVD as one really, really long string of numbers.
✦Digital fingerprints: (No pun intended that time.) Your fingerprint is
converted into numerical data, which a computer can use to compare
against fingerprint data from other people.
✦Automated telephone operators: When you call a phone operator these
days, you often aren’t speaking to a real person. Rather, the computer on
the other end of the line converts your voice into digits, which it uses to
interpret your words. (At other times, I think I’m talking to a real person,
but it’s hard to tell.)
What Can I Digitize?
As you’ve probably guessed by now, practically anything can be digitized. As
long as you can represent something as numbers, you can digitize that data.
Whether it’s photographs, video, or audio, your Mac is adept at digitizing
data and processing it.

What Can I Digitize?
254
Photographs
Perhaps the most popular of digital devices, the digital camera has trans-
formed photography forever. By using sophisticated electronics, digital cam-
eras convert the image that you see through the camera viewfinder into an
image made purely of numbers.
After this numeric information is transferred to your Macintosh, your com-
puter can cut, twist, fade, label, and paint your digital images. Because num-
bers are the only materials involved, you won’t need scissors, paint, or
adhesive tape to edit images. (Advertising photographers can say good-bye
to the old-fashioned airbrush.) Your Macintosh does it all by manipulating
those numbers. It cuts down on the messy art supplies and gives you the
comfort of being able to go back in time — something that anyone who’s not
so handy with scissors can appreciate.
Music
As I mention earlier in this chapter, audio CDs are one application of music
represented as digital data. The physical CD is just a piece of plastic with a
metal coating, but you don’t even really need CDs any longer. Your
Macintosh can digitize audio for storage on your hard drive, too, which
brings up another important point. Not only is digital information palatable
to a computer, but it’s also very portable. You can store it on any number of
storage devices, such as an iPod, a USB Flash drive, or an external hard
drive. (By the way, if you’re a musician, you can use GarageBand and exter-
nal instruments that will turn your Mac into a combination synthesizer, an
amplifier, and a backup band. Mozart would’ve loved this stuff.)
Video
When you photograph a scene multiple times per second and then replay
the sequence, you get (tah-dah!) moving pictures. In the analog (as opposed
to digital) world, this would be a strip of celluloid film or a strip of magnetic
tape. In the digital world, such a sequence of photographs is called DV, or
digital video. After you take your digital video, you can transfer that data to
your Macintosh to further manipulate it: You can edit it and add transitions,
text, and other effects.
DVD
Like a CD-ROM or a hard drive, a DVD is simply a means of storing digital
data. Although you can use it to save many different kinds of data, its most
common use is for presenting video content. The Macintosh digital hub can
produce DVDs by using any digital information that you give it.

The Software That Drives the Hub
At the heart of your digital hub is your Macintosh. To use and manipulate 
all the data that arrives at your Mac, your computer needs software, which
provides instructions on what to do with the information that you send.
Fortunately, Apple has fashioned some of the most attractive and easy-to-use
software ever written to help you manipulate and manage your digital
lifestyle. The list of software that belongs to the digital hub includes
✦iPhoto: Use iPhoto to download, manipulate, and organize your favorite
digital photographs. After everything is just so, iPhoto can print them,
burn them to disc, or even help you design and order a hardbound
album! (For way more on iPhoto, go to Book III, Chapter 3.)
✦iTunes: iTunes offers the ability to create and manage your music and
movie collection, along with sundry other media such as podcasts,
Internet radio, audiobooks, music videos, and movie trailers. You can
also purchase and download audio tracks and video from the Apple
Music Store. iTunes can even burn CDs! (Head to Book III, Chapter 2 for
more.)
✦iMovie: Every film director needs a movie-editing suite. iMovie gives you
the chance to set up Hollywood in your living room with outstanding
results. (For more, see Book III, Chapter 4.)
✦iDVD: As home video moves toward the digital realm, iDVD becomes an
essential tool for authoring your own DVD media. Home movies will
never be the same! (iDVD is covered in Book III, Chapter 5.)
✦GarageBand: Call it a “music-building” application! Even if you can’t play
a note, GarageBand makes it easy to create your own original songs —
and if you are a musician, you can turn your Mac into a production
studio. (Turn to Book III, Chapter 6 for more.)
✦iWeb: Interested in producing a professional-quality Web site, but afraid
that you’ll have to give up your personal life to build and maintain it?
Never fear, with iWeb you can join the Web publishing crowd the easy
Apple way. (I cover iWeb like a blanket in Book III, Chapter 8.)
✦iCal: To help keep your hectic digital lifestyle in order, iCal offers com-
plete calendar features. Besides tracking your dates and appointments
on your Mac, you can publish calendars on the Web or share them with
different parts of the digital hub. (Or, if you have an iPod, you can even
download your appointments and carry ’em with you.)
✦iSync: With so many digital devices at your disposal, it gets hard to keep
them all straight. iSync is software for automatically synchronizing con-
tact and calendar information between cellphones, your personal digital
assistant (PDA), an iPod, the Mac OS X Address Book, and iCal.

The Software That Drives the Hub
256
iPhoto
What good is a camera without a photo album? iPhoto, Apple’s photography
software, serves as a digital photo album. Use it to help you arrange and
manage your digital photos. Beyond its functions as a photo album, iPhoto
also gives you the ability to touch-up your images through cropping,
retouching, scaling, rotating, and red-eye reduction (photographically speak-
ing, not morning-after speaking).
Besides offering editing features, iPhoto also works automatically with your
digital camera. Simply plug in the camera to your Mac’s Universal Serial Bus
(USB) port, and iPhoto knows it’s there. Need to transfer photos from the
camera to your photo album? iPhoto can do that, too.
When you complete a collection of photographs that you find interesting,
use iPhoto to help you publish them on the Internet or even to create your
very own coffee-table book. (The latest in high-tech: a paper book.) And for
those of you who still want that nifty wallet print to show off at work or a
poster to hang on your wall, you can print them with your own printer or
order them online through iPhoto. Orders made with iPhoto show up in your
mailbox — the U.S. Postal Service physical one outside your domicile — a
few days later.
iTunes
To help you wrangle your enormous digital music and movie collection,
Apple offers iTunes. For starters, iTunes is a sophisticated audio player for
all your digital audio files. But iTunes is also handy for converting audio
tracks from audio CDs to a number of popular digital audio file formats, such
as AAC, MP3, and AIFF. After you import or convert your music into com-
puter files, iTunes helps you manage and maintain your music collection.
You can even listen to streaming online “radio stations,” 24 hours a day. The
latest version of iTunes even allows you to watch videos and movies, either
on your Mac or on your video-capable iPod.
Plus, Apple throws in the Apple Store with iTunes, where you can preview
hundreds of thousands of songs and videos for up to 30 seconds each with-
out spending a dime. (Podcast subscriptions and movie trailers are free,
bucko.) If you latch onto something that you’d like to buy, you can use your
credit card to purchase and download your media (either as individual
tracks for 99 cents each, or as a complete album or movie for a package
price). After the media that you’ve bought is comfortably nestled in iTunes,
you can play it on your Mac, burn music to an audio CD, or download it to
your iPod.

Why do I keep harping on the iPod? Well, as a proud owner of one, I’m glad
you asked: Apple’s iPod is a versatile, lightweight audio and video player
with hidden extras that James Bond would covet. It has enough capacity to
store your entire collection of music and several movies, but it’s small
enough to fit into your shirt pocket. With iTunes, you can instantly exchange
media between your Macintosh and your iPod. You can also use iTunes to
create audio and MP3 CDs for playback elsewhere. And the iPod even works
as honest-to-goodness, back-up storage . . . you see, it also functions as a
standard external FireWire or USB 2.0 hard drive. An iPod can display text
files and play games; you can carry even your Address Book contacts and
iCal appointments with you with aplomb. (For the lowdown on iPod, peruse
Book III, Chapter 2.)
iMovie
You needn’t restrict yourself to still images: Hook up your digital camcorder
to your Mac as well. Use iMovie, the easy-to-use video editing application
shown in Figure 1-2, to create and edit digital movies. 
Figure 1-2:

With stunning video-editing candy such as transitions, sound effects, and
video effects, iMovie turns your home movies into professional productions
that you’ll be proud to share with friends and family. Finally, you can have a
home movie night without putting everyone to sleep.
iDVD
Of course, after you create a video masterpiece, you probably want to save it
on a DVD for preservation and future viewing. To help you in your endeav-
ors, use iDVD to create — or, as video professionals call it, author — DVD
movies. With the preset templates, iDVD will have you cranking out stunning
DVDs with interactive menus in no time, ready to use with any DVD player.
GarageBand
Imagine the freedom to create your own original music by simply dragging
“digital instruments” onto a canvas . . . and then adding your own voice or
the lead instrument! After the basic melody is in place, you’d want to be able
to edit whatever you like, or even choose different instruments with the click
of a mouse. As recently as ten years ago, dear reader, that concept was
indeed just a dream. Then, software-based synthesizers and mixing applica-
tions brought musicians into the digital age. (The problem was that normal
human beings couldn’t afford the expensive software or the sample libraries
of literally thousands of different instruments.) With the addition of
GarageBand, however, the iLife suite provides everything that you need to
start making your own music (inexpensively) and then create MP3 files or
burn your own audio CDs. And believe me, if I can create a techno track that
actually hit the speakers at a local dance club, you can too!
iWeb
In the days of old — I’m talking three or four years ago here — putting a Web
site online meant hours of drudgery, usually with a so-called “what you see
is what you get” page creation application. Problem was, “what you saw”
was very rarely easy to create, and if you were actually successful in getting
the results you wanted, you still had to get all that stuff to appear on a Web
server somewhere so that visitors could actually see it. With iWeb, the cre-
ation of a Web site is intuitive, easy, and downright fun! Click and drag your
way to the Web site you want, starting with a number of truly outstanding
pre-designed templates. Add all sorts of cool pages, like blogs and auto-
mated online photo albums. And the best part? Click a couple of buttons,
and your new work of online art appears automatically on your .Mac Web
site, or as a group of files that’s ready for uploading to your Web server.
Voila!

Can I Use All This Stuff at Once?
What makes the digital hub idea even juicier is that it’s an interoperable
model. Let’s pause to appreciate that. (What, you don’t speak engineer? No
problem!) In plain English, the digital hub allows you to use digital media
from one part of the hub with another part of the hub. Thus, the individual
parts of the digital hub can work together to complement each other. To
illustrate, consider some digital sharing scenarios:
✦You shoot a great photograph of your kids. It’s so great, in fact, that
you’d like to use it as the title page of your family’s home movie. With
the digital hub, you can use that same photograph in iMovie to create
your home flick. When you’re done with that, transfer the whole thing 
to a DVD by using iDVD, and your masterpiece is safe for decades of
viewing. One image just worked its way through three parts of the 
digital hub.
✦You just recorded a catchy song with GarageBand. You add the song to
the soundtrack of the music video that you’re creating with iMovie.
Then you create a fancy opening menu and burn the finished project to
DVD with iDVD to show prospective agents. Again, one piece of media
has traveled through three parts of the digital hub!
✦Your band becomes popular and starts to play some impressive gigs.
To document your band’s rise to stardom, your friend films a concert
with a DV camcorder. You use iMovie to transfer the video to your
Macintosh and create clips of your favorite performances of the concert.
The clips are transferred over to the primo Web site you’ve created with
iWeb, and your band’s Internet image takes off! After that, it’s a simple
matter to author to DVD with iDVD, extract the audio from the video for
use as an MP3 with iTunes, and grab an image from the video for a band
scrapbook that you’re creating with iPhoto. Now you’ve attained honest-
to-goodness DHH (shorthand for Digital Hub Heaven). You’ve traversed
the entire hub, easily sharing the media along the way.
Lest I forget, I should mention the other advantage of the digital hub: The
media that you swap between all your “iApplications” remains in digital
form, which is A Good Thing! In the previous example of shooting a concert,
for instance, that concert footage remained practically pristine while it was
being transferred to DVD, converted to MP3, pasted into your iPhoto album,
or uploaded to your iWeb site. (Since some audio and video formats are com-
pressed to save space, like MP3, a purist will argue that you lost a little some-
thing. It ain’t much.) Unlike archaic analog VHS tape, you don’t have to
worry about whether your source is second-generation — and you can
forget degradation and that silly tracking control

ood news! It’s time to throw out your Dad’s Hi-Fi from the early ’70s
(you know, the one with the 4-inch speakers that you’re embarrassed
to show your friends). Every installation of Mac OS X comes with the finest
stereophonic gadget in town: a great audio application called iTunes. With
iTunes, you can listen to your favorite songs and podcasts, organize your
music collection, watch a video or a full-length movie, listen to radio sta-
tions from around the world, buy music and video online, burn CDs and
DVDs, and much more! iTunes has so many features that you’ll soon find
yourself wondering why you even own a stereo at all. In no time, you’ll be
pondering how much new speakers with a subwoofer will cost for your Mac.
In this chapter, I show you how to play audio CDs, podcasts, videos, and
Internet downloads, but that’s just the beginning. You discover how to use
iTunes’ Library to get one-click access to any song in your collection. I even
show you how to tune into Internet radio (and share your favorite songs
with others on your network), burn audio CDs (if you have the necessary
hardware), plug in your iPod, and buy the latest hits from the iTunes Store.
(And I demonstrate how to make your iTunes window look just as good as
your music sounds.)
Just in case, though, keep your Dad’s Hi-Fi . . . it might fetch a hefty sum as
an antique on eBay.

What Can I Play on iTunes?
262
What Can I Play on iTunes?
Simply put, iTunes is a media player; it plays audio and video files. These
files can be in any of many different formats. Some of the more common
audio formats that iTunes supports are
✦MP3: The small size of MP3 files has made them popular for file trading
on the Internet. You can reduce MP3 files to a ridiculously small size (at
the expense of audio fidelity), but a typical CD-quality, three-minute pop
song in MP3 format has a size of 3–5MB.
✦AAC: AAC (short for Advanced Audio Coding) is an audio format that’s
very similar to MP3; in fact, AAC files offer better recording quality at
the same file sizes. However, this format also supports a built-in copy
protection scheme that prevents AAC music from being widely distrib-
uted on Macs. (Luckily, you can still burn AAC tracks to an audio CD,
just like MP3 tracks.) The tracks that you download from the iTunes
Store are in AAC format.
The iTunes Store’s iTunes Plus tracks are also in AAC format, but these
tracks are not copy-protected, and they’re encoded at a higher-quality
256 Kbps rate — hence their higher price.
✦Apple Lossless: Another format direct from Apple, Apple Lossless format
provides the best compromise between file size and sound quality:
These tracks are encoded without loss of quality. However, Apple
Lossless tracks are somewhat larger than AAC, so it’s generally the
favorite of the most discerning audiophile for their entire music library.
✦AIFF: The standard Macintosh audio format produces sound of the
absolute highest quality. This high quality, however, also means that the
files are pretty doggone huge. A typical pop song in AIFF format has a
size of 30–50MB.
✦WAV: Not to be outdone, Microsoft created its own audio file format
(WAV) that works much like AIFF. It can reproduce sound at higher qual-
ity than MP3, but the file sizes are very large, like AIFF.
✦CD audio: iTunes can play audio CDs. Because you don’t usually store
CD audio anywhere but on an audio CD, file size is no big whoop.
✦Movies and video: You can buy and download full-length movies, TV
shows, music videos, and movie trailers from the iTunes Store . . . and,
with an Apple TV unit connected to your home theater system, you can
watch those movies and videos from the comfort of your sofa on the
other side of your house.
✦Podcasts: These relatively new programs are like radio programs for
your iPod — but iTunes can play and organize them, too. Some podcasts
also include video and photos to boot.

263
✦Audiobooks: No longer do you need cassettes or audio CDs to enjoy
your spoken books — iTunes can play them for you, or you can send
them to your iPod for listening on the go.
✦Streaming Internet radio: You can listen to a continuous broadcast of
songs from one of tens of thousands of Internet radio stations, with qual-
ity levels ranging from what you’d expect from FM radio to the full qual-
ity of an audio CD. You can’t save the music in iTunes, but it’s still great
fun. (In fact, I run my own station . . . more on MLC Radio later in the
chapter.)
Playing an Audio CD
Playing an audio CD in iTunes is simple. Just insert the CD in your com-
puter’s disc tray, close the tray, start iTunes by clicking its icon on the Dock,
and click the Play button. (Note that your Mac might be set to automatically
launch iTunes when you insert an audio CD.) The iTunes interface resembles
that of a traditional cassette or CD player. The main playback controls of the
iTunes are Play, Previous Song, Next Song, and the Volume Slider, as shown
in Figure 2-1.

Click the Play button to begin listening to a song. While a song is playing, the
Play button toggles to a Pause button. As you might imagine, clicking that
button again pauses the music. If you don’t feel like messing around with a
mouse, you can always use the keyboard. The spacebar acts as the Play and
Pause buttons. Press the spacebar to begin playback; press it again to stop.
Click the Next Song button to advance to the next song on the CD. The
Previous Song button works like the Next Song button but with a slight twist:
If a song is currently playing and you click the Previous Song button, iTunes
first returns to the beginning of the current song (just like an audio CD
player). To advance to the previous song, double-click the Previous Song
button. To change the volume of your music, click and drag the volume
slider.
Like other Macintosh applications, you can control much of iTunes with
the keyboard. Table 2-1 lists some of the more common iTunes keyboard
shortcuts.

Playing Digital Audio and Video
In addition to playing audio CDs, iTunes can also play the digital audio files
that you download from the Internet or obtain from other sources in the
WAV, AAC, Apple Lossless, AIFF, and MP3 file formats. Enjoying a digital
audio file is just slightly more complicated than playing a CD. After down-
loading or saving your audio files to your Mac, open the Finder and navigate
to wherever you stored the files. Then simply drag the music files (or an
entire folder of music) from the Finder into the Music entry in the iTunes
Source list. (The added files appear in the iTunes Music Library. Think of 
the Library as a master list of your music. To view the Music Library, select
the Music entry in the left-hand column of the iTunes player, as shown in

Figure 2-2. Go figure.) Heck, you can also drag a song file from a Finder
window and drop it on the iTunes icon in the Dock, which adds it to your
Music Library as well.
If you drop the file on top of a playlist name in the Source list, iTunes adds it
to that particular playlist as well as the main Library. (More about playlists in
a bit.)
To play a song, just double-click it in the Music Library list. Alternatively,
you can use the playback controls (Play, Previous Song, and Next Song) that
I discuss earlier in this chapter (refer to Figure 2-1).
The Source list of iTunes can list up to six possible sources for music:
✦Library: This section includes Music, Movies, TV Shows, Podcasts,
Audiobooks, iPod Games, and Radio. (Think Internet radio, which I 
discuss further in the section, “iTunes Radio.”)
✦iPod: If an iPod is connected, it appears in the list. (And yes, Virginia,
other models of MP3 players from other companies will also appear in
the list if they support iTunes.)
Figure 2-2:

266
✦iTunes Store: I discuss this later in the section, “Buying Digital Media
the Apple Way.”
✦Audio CD: A standard audio CD . . . anything from the Bee Gees to Fall
Out Boy.
✦Shared music: If another Mac on your local network is running iTunes
and is set to share part or all its library, you can connect to the other
computer for your music. (Shared music on another Mac appears as a
separate named folder in the Source list.)
✦Playlists: Think of playlists as folders you use to organize your music.
(More on playlists later in this chapter.)
If you’ve invested in an Apple TV, it will appear in the list, but it doesn’t actu-
ally provide media for you to enjoy on your Mac — instead, content flows in
the other direction, with iTunes streaming or synchronizing media to your
Apple TV, which in turn sends it to your ED- or HD-TV.
Notice also that the Library lists information for each song that you add to
it, such as
✦Song Name: The title of the song
✦Time: The length of the song
✦Artist: The artist who performs the song
✦Album: The album on which the song appears
If some of the songs that you’re adding don’t display anything for the title,
album, or artist information, don’t panic; most MP3 files have embedded
data that iTunes can read. If a song doesn’t include any data, you can always
add the information to these fields manually. I show you how later in the sec-
tion “Setting or changing the song information manually.”
Clicking any of the column headings in the Library causes iTunes to reorder
the Library according to that category. For example, clicking the Song Name
column heading alphabetizes your Library by song title. I click the Time
heading often to sort my Library according to the length of the songs. Oh,
and you can drag column titles to reorder them any way you like.
iTunes can display your Music Library in three ways: By default, the applica-
tion uses the list view you see in Figure 2-1, where each song is one entry.
Click the second View button (at the top of the iTunes window) to group
tracks together by album artwork. Click the third View button, and you’re
browsing by album cover, complete with reflective surface!

Browsing the Library
After you add a few dozen songs to iTunes, viewing the Library can become
a task. Although a master list is nice for some purposes, it becomes as cum-
bersome as an elephant in a subway tunnel if the list is very long. To help
out, iTunes can display your Library in another format, too: namely, brows-
ing mode. To view the Library in browsing mode, click the Browse button at
the lower-right corner of the iTunes window, which carries an eye icon.
The Browse mode of iTunes displays your library in a compact fashion,
organizing your tunes into four sections:
✦Genre
✦Artist
✦Album
✦Song Name
Selecting an artist from the Artist list causes iTunes to display that artist’s
albums in the Album list. Select an album from the Album list, and iTunes
displays that album’s songs in the bottom section of the Browse window.
(Those Apple software designers . . . always thinking of you and me.)
Finding songs in your Music Library
After your collection of audio files grows large, you might have trouble locat-
ing that Swedish remix version of “I’m Your Boogie Man.” To help you out,
iTunes has a built-in Search function. To find a song, type some text into the
Will I trash my Count Basie?
Novice iTunes users, take note: iTunes watches
your back when you trash tracks.
To illustrate: Suppose you delete a song from
the Library that’s located only in the iTunes
music folder (which you didn’t copy into iTunes
from another location on your hard drive). That
means you’re about to delete the song entirely,
and there’ll be no copy remaining on your 
Mac at all. Rest assured, though, that iTunes
prompts you to make sure that you really want
to move the file to the Trash. (I get fearful e-mail
messages all the time from readers who are
loath to delete anything from iTunes because
they’re afraid they’ll trash their digital music
files completely.)
Remember: If you delete a song from the
Library that also exists elsewhere on your hard
drive (outside the reach of the iTunes music
folder), it isn’t deleted from your hard drive. In
fact, if you mistakenly remove a song that you
meant to keep, just drag it back into iTunes from
the Finder, or even from the Trash. ’Nuff said.

Playing Digital Audio and Video
268
search field of the main iTunes window. While you type, iTunes tries to find a
selection that matches your search text. The search is quite thorough, show-
ing any matching text from the artist, album, song title, and genre fields in
the results. For example, if you type Electronic into the field, iTunes might
return results for the band named Electronic or other tunes that you classi-
fied as electronic in the Genre field. (The section “Know Your Songs” later in
this chapter tells you how to classify your songs by genre, among other
options.) Click the magnifying glass at the left side of the Search field to
restrict the search even more: by Artists, Albums, Composers, and Songs.
Removing old music from the Library
After you spend some time playing songs with iTunes, you might decide that
you didn’t really want to add 40 different versions of “Louie Louie” to your
Library. (Personally, I prefer either the original or the cast from the movie
Animal House.) To remove a song from the Library, click the song to select it
and then press the Delete key on your keyboard.
You can also remove a song from the Library by dragging it to the Trash in
your Dock.
Watching video
Watching video in iTunes is similar to listening to your music. To view your
video collection, click one of these entries in the Source list:
✦Movies
✦Music Videos
✦TV Shows
If you select Movies or TV Shows, iTunes displays your videos as thumb-
nails. Music Videos appear as a standard Playlist.
From your collection, you can
✦Double-click a video thumbnail or an entry in the list.
✦Drag any QuickTime-compatible video clip from the Finder window to
the iTunes window. (These typically include video files ending in .mov
or .mp4.)
iTunes plays video full-screen, but when you move your mouse, a control
strip appears, sporting the standard slider bar that you can drag to move
through the video (as well as a volume control and Fast Forward/Reverse
buttons). You can also pause the video by clicking the Pause button.

Keeping Slim Whitman and Slim Shady Apart: Organizing with Playlists

Keeping Slim Whitman and Slim Shady Apart:
Organizing with Playlists
As I mention earlier, the iTunes Music Library can quickly become a fear-
somely huge beastie. Each Library can thousands upon thousands of songs:
If your Library grows anywhere near that large, finding all the songs in your
lifelong collection of Paul Simon albums is not a fun task. Furthermore, with
the Library, you’re stuck playing songs in the order that iTunes lists them.
To help you organize your music into groups, use the iTunes playlist feature.
A playlist is a collection of some of your favorite songs from the Library. You
can create as many playlists as you want, and each playlist can contain any
numbers of songs. Whereas the Library lists all available songs, a playlist
displays only the songs that you add to it. Further, any changes that you
make to a playlist affect only that playlist, leaving the Library intact.
To create a playlist, you can do any of the following:
✦Choose File➪New Playlist.
✦Press Ô+N.
✦Choose File➪New Playlist from Selection. This creates a new playlist
and automatically adds any tracks that are currently selected.
✦Click the New Playlist button in the iTunes window (the plus sign
button in the lower-left corner). You get a newly created empty playlist
(the toe-tappin’ untitled playlist).
All playlists appear in the Source list. To help organize your playlists, it’s a
good idea to . . . well . . . name them. (Aren’t you glad now that you have this
book?) For example, suppose that you want to plan a party for your polka-
loving friends. Instead of running to your computer after each song to
change the music, you could create a polka-only playlist. Select and start the
playlist at the beginning of the party, and you won’t have to worry about
changing the music the whole night. (You can concentrate on the accor-
dion.) To load a playlist, select it in the Source list; iTunes displays the songs
for that playlist.
The same song can appear in any number of playlists because the songs in a
playlist are simply pointers to songs in your Music Library — not the songs
themselves. Add and remove them at will to any playlist, secure in the
knowledge that the songs remain safe in the Library. Removing a playlist is
simple: Select the playlist in the Source list and then press Delete.
Removing a playlist doesn’t actually delete any songs from your Library.

Know Your Songs
270
Click the Party Shuffle playlist, and you encounter a random selection of
songs taken from your iTunes Music Library — perfect for your next party!
You can change the order of the songs in the Party Shuffle playlist, add
songs from your Library, or delete songs that don’t fit the scintillating ambi-
ence of your gathering. Enjoy!
Know Your Songs
Besides organizing your music into Elvis and non-Elvis playlists, iTunes gives
you the option to track your music at the song level. Each song that you add
to the Music Library has a complete set of information associated with it.
iTunes displays this information in the Info dialog, including
Some playlists are smarter than others
Click the File menu and take a look at a menu
command for creating a smart playlist. The
contents of a smart playlist are automatically
created from a specific condition or set of con-
ditions that you set via the Smart Playlist dialog:
You can limit the track selection by mundane
things, like album, genre, or artist; or you can
get funky and specify songs that were played
last, or by the date you added tracks, or even
by the sampling rate or total length of the song.
For example, iTunes can create a playlist
packed with songs that are shorter than three
minutes, so you can fill your iPod Shuffle with
more stuff! Ah, but wait, you’re not limited to a
single criterion. If you want to add other crite-
rion, click the plus sign at the right side of the
dialog, and you get another condition field to
refine your selection even further.
You can choose the maximum songs to add to
the smart playlist, or limit the size of the playlist
by the minutes or hours of play or the number
of megabytes or gigabytes the playlist will
occupy. (Again, great for automatically gather-
ing as much from your KISS collection that will
fit into a specific amount of space on a CD or
your iPod.) Mark the Live Updating check box
for the ultimate in convenience. iTunes auto-
matically maintains the contents of the smart
playlist to keep it current with your conditions
at all times in the future. (If you remove tracks
manually from a smart playlist, iTunes adds
other tracks that match your conditions.)
Now think about what all these settings mean
when combined . . . whoa. Here’s an example
yanked directly from my own iTunes library. I
created a smart playlist that selects only those
songs in the Rock genre. It’s limited to 25 songs,
selected by least often played, and live updat-
ing is turned on. The playlist is named Tracks
I’ve Gotta Hear because it finds the 25 rock
songs (from my collection of 1,654 songs) that
I’ve heard least often! After I listen to a song
from this smart playlist, iTunes automatically
“freshens” it with another song, allowing me to
catch up on the tracks I’ve been ignoring.
Completely, unbelievably sweet — and another
reason why iTunes is the best music player on
Planet Earth!

✦Album Artist: The name of the artist responsible for a compilation or
tribute album
✦Album: The album where the song appears
✦Grouping: A group type that you assign

✦BPM: The beats per minute (which indicates the song’s tempo)
✦Track Number: The position of the song on the original album
✦Disc Number: The original disc number in a multi-CD set
✦Comments: A text field that can contain any comments on the song
✦Genre: The classification of the song (such as rock, jazz, or pop)
You can display this information by clicking a song name and pressing 
Ô+I — the fields appear on the Info tab.
Setting the song information automatically
Each song that you add to the iTunes Music Library might have song infor-
mation included with it. If you add music from a commercial audio CD,
iTunes connects to a server on the Internet and attempts to find the informa-
tion for each song on the CD. If you download a song from the Internet, it
often comes with some information embedded in the file already; the
amount of included information depends on what the creator supplied. (And
believe me, it’s often misspelled as well — think Leenard Skeenard.) If you
don’t have an Internet connection, iTunes can’t access the information and
displays generic titles instead.
Setting or changing the song information manually
If iTunes can’t find your CD in the online database or someone gives you an
MP3 with incomplete or inaccurate information, you can change the informa-
tion yourself — believe me, you want at least the artist and song name! To
view and change the information for a song, perform the following steps:
1. Select the song in either the Music Library list or a Playlist.
2. Press Ô+I or choose File➪Get Info.
3. Edit the song’s information on the Info tab, as shown in Figure 2-3.

Know Your Songs
272
Keep in mind that the more work you put into setting the information of the
songs in your Music Library, the easier it is to browse and use iTunes.
Incomplete song information can make it more difficult to find your songs in
a hurry. If you prefer, you don’t have to change all information about a song
(it just makes life easier later if you do). Normally, you can get away with set-
ting only a song’s title, artist, and genre. The more information you put in,
however, the faster you can locate songs and the easier they are to arrange.
iTunes tries to help by automatically retrieving known song information, but
sometimes you have to roll up your sleeves and do a little work. (Sorry, but
the DataElves are out to lunch.)
“What about cover art, Mark?” Well, I’m overjoyed that you asked! iTunes
can try to locate artwork automatically for the tracks you select. (Note that
adding large images can significantly increase the size of the song file.)
Follow these steps:
1. Select the desired songs from the track list.
2. Click Advanced➪Get Album Artwork.

Unfortunately, the Get Album Artwork feature often doesn’t pull in Want to

and drop it on top of the image well. When you click OK, the image appears
in the Summary pane, and you can display it while your music is playing by
pressing Ô+G, or by pressing the Show or Hide Song Artwork button at the
lower left of the iTunes window! (Note that adding large images can signifi-
cantly increase the size of the song file.)
By the way, if you buy tracks or an album from the iTunes Store, Apple
always includes album covers automatically. Thanks, Steve!
Ripping Audio Files
You don’t have to rely on Internet downloads to get audio files: You can
create your own MP3, AAC, Apple Lossless, AIFF, and WAV files from your
audio CDs with iTunes. The process of converting audio files to different 
formats is ripping. (Audiophiles with technical teeth also call this process
digital extraction, but they’re usually ignored at parties by the popular
crowd.) Depending on what hardware or software you use, each has its own
unique format preferences. For example, most iPod owners prefer MP3 or
AAC files, but your audio CDs aren’t in that format. Being able to convert
files from one format to another is like having a personal translator in the
digital world. You don’t need to worry if you have the wrong format: You can
simply convert it to the format that you need.
The most common type of ripping is to convert CD audio to MP3 format. To
rip MP3s from an audio CD, follow these simple steps:
1. Launch iTunes by clicking its icon on the Dock.
Alternatively, you can locate it in your Applications folder.
2. Choose iTunes➪Preferences.

Tweaking the Audio for Your Ears

3. In the Preferences window that appears, click the Advanced toolbar
button.
4. Click the Importing tab.
5. Choose MP3 Encoder from the Import Using pop-up menu.
6. Choose High Quality (160 Kbps) from the Setting pop-up menu and
then click OK.
This bit rate setting provides the best compromise between quality 
(it gives you better than CD quality, which is 128 Kbps) and file size
(tracks you rip will be significantly smaller than “audiophile” bit rates
like 192 Kbps or higher).
7. Load an audio CD into your Mac.
The CD title shows up in the iTunes Source list, which is on the left side
of the iTunes interface. The CD track listing appears on the right side of
the interface.
If iTunes asks you if you want to import the contents of the CD into 
your Music Library, you can click Yes and skip the rest of the steps . . .
however, if you’ve disabled this prompt, just continue with the remain-
ing two steps.
8. Clear the check box of any song that you don’t want to import from
the CD.
All songs on the CD have a check box next to their title by default.
Unmarked songs aren’t imported.
Notice that the Browse button changes to Import CD.
9. After you select the songs that you want added to the Library, click
the Import CD button.
Tweaking the Audio for Your Ears
Besides the standard volume controls that I mention earlier in this chapter,
iTunes offers a full equalizer. An equalizer permits you to alter the volume of
various frequencies in your music, allowing you to boost low sounds, lower
high sounds, or anything in between. Now you can customize the way that
your music sounds and adjust it to your liking.
To open the Equalizer (as shown in Figure 2-4), do one of the following:

Tweaking the Audio for Your Ears
275
✦Choose Window➪Equalizer.
✦Press Ô+Option+2.
✦Choose View➪Show Equalizer.
The Equalizer window has an impressive array of 11 sliders. Use leftmost
slider (Preamp) to set the overall level of the Equalizer. The remaining slid-
ers represent various frequencies that the human ear can perceive. Setting a
slider to a position in the middle of its travel causes that frequency to play
back with no change. Move the slider above the midpoint to boost that fre-
quency; conversely, move the slider below the midpoint to reduce the
volume of that frequency.
Continue adjusting the equalizer sliders until your music sounds how you
like it. When you close the Equalizer window, iTunes remembers your set-
tings until you change them again. If you prefer to leave frequencies to the
experts, the iTunes Equalizer has several predefined settings to match most
musical styles. Click the pop-up menu at the top of the Equalizer window to
select a genre.

A New Kind of Radio Station

After you adjust the sound to your satisfaction, close the Equalizer window
to return to the iTunes interface and relax with those funky custom notes
from James Brown.
A New Kind of Radio Station
Besides playing back your favorite audio files, iTunes can also tune in
Internet radio stations from around the globe. You can listen to any of a large
number of preset stations, seek out lesser-known stations not recognized by
iTunes, or even add your favorite stations to your Playlists. This section
shows you how to do it all.
iTunes Radio
Although it’s not a radio tuner in the strictest sense, iTunes Radio can locate
virtual radio stations all over the world that send audio over the Internet —
a process usually dubbed streaming amongst the “In” Internet crowd. iTunes
can track down hundreds of Internet radio stations in a variety of styles with
only a few mouse clicks.
To begin listening to Internet radio with iTunes, click the Radio icon located
beneath the Library icon in the Source list. The result is a list of more than
20 types of radio stations, organized by genre.
When you expand a Radio category by clicking its triangle, iTunes queries a
tuning server and locates the name and address of dozens of radio stations
for that category. Whether you like Elvis or not-Elvis (those passing fads, like
new wave, classical, or alternative), something’s here for everyone. The
Radio also offers news, sports, and talk radio.
What’s with the numbers next 
to the station names?
When choosing an Internet radio station, keep
your Internet connection speed in mind. If
you’re using a broadband DSL or cable con-
nection — or if you’re listening at work over
your company’s high-speed network — you
can listen to stations broadcasting at 128 Kbps
(or even higher). The higher the bit rate, 
the better the music sounds. At 128 Kbps, for
example, you’re listening to sound that’s as
good as an audio CD.
However, if you’re listening over a dialup
modem connection, iTunes can’t keep up with
audio streaming at higher bit rates, so you’re
limited to stations broadcasting at 56 Kbps or
lower.

A New Kind of Radio Station
277
After iTunes fetches the names and descriptions of radio stations, double-
click one that you want to hear. iTunes immediately jumps into action, loads
the station, and begins to play it.
Tuning in your own stations
Although iTunes offers you a large list of popular radio stations on the Web,
it’s by no means comprehensive. Eventually, you might run across a radio
station that you’d like to hear, but it’s not listed in iTunes. Luckily, iTunes
permits you to listen to other stations, too. To listen to a radio station that
iTunes doesn’t list, you need the station’s Web address.
In iTunes, choose Advanced➪Open Stream (or press Ô+U). In the Open
Stream dialog that appears (as shown in Figure 2-5), enter the URL of your
desired radio station and then click OK. Within seconds, iTunes tunes in
your station.
Radio stations in your Playlists
If you find yourself visiting an online radio station more than once, you’ll be
glad to know that iTunes supports radio stations in its Playlists. To add a
radio station to a Playlist from the Radio, do the following:
1. Open the category that contains the station that you want to add to
your Playlist.
2. Locate the station that you want to add to your Playlist and drag it
from the Radio list to the desired Playlist on the left.
If you haven’t created any Playlists yet, see the section “Keeping Slim
Whitman and Slim Shady Apart: Organizing with Playlists” earlier in this
chapter to find out how.
“I have an itch to hear ‘Kung Fu Fighting!’”
This particular technology author has a prefer-
ence for a certain hot Net jam spot: MLC Radio,
the Internet radio station I’ve been running for
several years now. I call my station a ’70s Time
Machine because it includes hundreds of clas-
sic hits from 1970–1979, inclusive. You hear
everything from “Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo”
by Rick Derringer to “Moonlight Feels Right” by
Starbuck. (Hey, I’m summing up a decade here,
so be prepared for both Rush and the Captain
and Tennille, too.) The station broadcasts at 128
Kbps (audio CD quality), so you need a broad-
band connection to listen. For the radio’s
Internet address or help connecting to MLC
Radio, visit my Web site at www.mlcbooks.
com — then follow the steps in the next sec-
tion to add MLC Radio to your playlists!

iSending iStuff to iPod
278
Adding a radio station that doesn’t appear in the Radio list is a bit trickier
but possible nonetheless. Even though iTunes allows you to load a radio sta-
tion URL manually by using the Open Stream command in the Advanced
menu, it doesn’t give you an easy way to add it to the Playlist. Follow these
steps to add a specific radio station to a Playlist:
1. Add any radio station from the Radio list to your desired Playlist.
Any station in the list will do, as you’ll immediately change both the sta-
tion’s URL and name to create your new station entry in the Playlist.
2. Press Ô+I or choose File➪Get Info to bring up the information dialog
for that station.
3. Click the Summary section and change the URL by clicking the Edit
URL button.
4. Enter the desired URL and click OK.
5. Click the Info tab, type the new station name, and then click OK.
iSending iStuff to iPod
If you’re lucky enough (like me) to own an iPod, you’ll be happy to know that
iTunes has features for your personal audio and video jukebox as well. iPods,
Apple’s MP3 players, comprise an entire family of portable devices (ranging

from $79 to about $349) that can hold anywhere from about 300 songs to lit-
erally thousands of songs, as well as podcasts, photos, and video. This great
gadget and those like it have become known world-wide as the preferred
portable digital media player.
You connect your iPod to any Macintosh with USB 2.0 ports with the
included cable. After the iPod’s connected, it automatically synchronizes to
the Playlists in iTunes. The iPod and the iTunes software communicate with
each other and figure out what items are in your iTunes Library (as com-
pared with the iPod Library). If they discover songs, podcasts, and video in
your iTunes Library that are missing from your iPod, the items automatically
transfer to the iPod. Conversely, if the iPod contains stuff that’s no longer in
iTunes, the iPod automatically removes those files from its drive.
Go back and reread that last sentence above about the iPod automatically
removing files from its drive. (I’ll wait here.) Apple added this feature in an
effort to be attentive to copyright concerns. The reasoning is that if you con-
nect your iPod to your friend’s computer, you can’t transfer songs from the
iPod to that computer. Of course, you could always look at it from the mar-
keting perspective as a feature that makes sure your Mac and iPod are
always in total sync. Whatever the case, pay close attention and read all
warning dialogs when connecting to a Mac other than your own, or you
might wipe out your iPod’s library.
The best thing I can say about the iPod and iTunes combination is . . . well . . .
that there isn’t anything else to say about them. The auto-sync feature is so
easy to use, you forget about it almost immediately.
Need a bigger screen for iPod video and photos?
Today’s generation of video iPods are great
devices, but they lack two important features
that today’s discerning media maven demands:
a decent-sized portable widescreen display
and a pair of speakers that you don’t shove in
your ears. That’s where the iFlip Mi8000 from
Memorex comes in — it’s my favorite portable
display for the iPod. Simply plug your iPod into
the iFlip, and you suddenly gain a superb 8.4”
widescreen LCD display and built-in stereo
sound from the iFlip speakers. And all this from
a unit that’s not much bigger than a hardcover
book . . . it can even recharge your video iPod
while you watch!
In case you want to share your audio or video
with others, the iFlip Mi8000 includes dual
headphone jacks for you and your significant
other, as well as both an audio line-out jack (to
hook to a stereo system) and an S-Video out
port to connect to an external TV. Along with
video and audio, you can use the iFlip as a still
image “picture frame,” showing your iPhoto
images or slideshows.
You can buy the iFlip directly from Memorex at
www.memorex.com for $199 . . . your family’s
appreciation is a free bonus.

Sharing Your Media across Your Network
280
This chapter — even as long as it is — just can’t explain all the ins and outs
of the iTunes/iPod relationship! For a complete look at both iTunes and the
iPod, I can heartily recommend a fellow For Dummies book, iPod & iTunes
For Dummies, 4th Edition, by Tony Bove and Cheryl Rhodes.
Sharing Your Media across Your Network
Ready to share your music, podcasts, and video — legally, mind you — with
other folks on your local network? You can offer your digital media to other
iTunes users across your home or office. Follow these steps:
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences to open the Preferences dialog.
2. Click Sharing.
3. Select the Share My Library on My Local Network check box.
4. Specify whether you want to share your entire library or only
selected playlists and files.
Sharing selected playlists is a good idea for those Meatmen and 
Sex Pistols fans who work at a cubicle farm in a big corporation.
5. If you want to restrict access to just a few people, select the Require
Password check box; then type a password in the text box.
6. Click OK.
Your shared folder appears within the Source list for all iTunes users who
enabled the Look for Shared Libraries check box on the same pane of the
Preferences dialog. Note that the music you share with others can’t be
imported or copied, so everything stays legal.
Want to change that frumpy default name for your shared media library to
something more exotic, like “Dan’s Techno Beat Palace”? No problem — dis-
play the Preferences dialog again, but this time click the General button and
click in the Shared Name text box. Edit your network entertainment persona
to your heart’s content.
Have you picked up an Apple TV for your home entertainment system? This
new device can send your digital media wirelessly from iTunes on your Mac
or PC straight to your widescreen TV and high-tech audio system. In fact,
there’s enough to cover there for a whole book . . . hence my latest Mac how-

Burning Music to Shiny Plastic Circles

Burning Music to Shiny Plastic Circles
Besides being a great audio player, iTunes is adept at creating CDs, too.
iTunes makes the process of recording songs to a CD as simple as a few
mouse clicks — making the modern version of a compilation (or mix) tape is
easier than getting a kid to eat ice cream. iTunes lets you burn CDs in one of
three formats:
✦Audio CD: This is the typical kind of commercial music CD that you buy
at a store. Most typical music audio CDs store 700MB of data, which
translates into about 80 minutes of music.
✦Data CD or DVD: A standard CD-ROM or DVD-ROM is recorded with the
audio files. This disc can’t be played in any standard audio CD player
(even if it supports MP3 CDs, which I discuss next). Therefore, you can
listen to these songs only by using your Mac and an audio player, like
iTunes or a PC running Windows.
✦MP3 CD: Like the ordinary computer CD-ROM that I describe, an MP3 CD
holds MP3 files in data format. However, the files are arranged in such a
way that they can be recognized by audio CD players that support the
MP3 CD format (especially boomboxes, personal CD players, and car
stereos). Because MP3 files are so much smaller than the digital audio
tracks found on traditional audio CDs, you can fit as many as 160 typical
4-minute songs on one disc. These discs can also be played on your Mac
via iTunes.
Sending music elsewhere with AirTunes
If your Mac has an AirPort Extreme wireless
card and you’re using an AirPort Express
portable wireless Base Station, you can ship
your songs right to your Base Station from
within iTunes, and from there to your home
stereo or boom box! (I get into some serious
discussion of AirPort Express in Book V,
Chapter 4.)
After your AirPort Express Base Station is
plugged in and you connect your home stereo
(or a boombox, or a pair of powered stereo
speakers) to the stereo mini-jack on the Base
Station, you see a Speakers pop-up list button
appear at the bottom of the iTunes window. (If
the Speakers button doesn’t appear, choose
iTunes➪Preferences to open the Preferences
dialog and click the Advanced tab. Make sure
that the Look for Remote Speakers Connected
with AirTunes check box is enabled.)
Click the Speakers button, and you can choose
to broadcast the music you’re playing in iTunes
across your wireless network. Ain’t technology
truly grand?

Feasting on iTunes Visuals
282
Keep in mind that MP3 CDs aren’t the same as the standard audio CDs that
you buy at the store, and you can’t play them in older audio CD players that
don’t support the MP3 CD format. Rather, this is the kind of archival disc
that you burn at home for your own collection.
First things first: Before you burn, you need to set the recording format.
Open the iTunes Preferences dialog by choosing iTunes➪Preferences, click
the Advanced button, and then click the Burning tab. Select the desired disc
format by enabling the corresponding radio button. Click OK to close the
Preferences window when you’re finished.
The next step in the CD creation process is to build a playlist (or select an
existing playlist that you want to record). If necessary, create a new Playlist
and add to it whatever songs you would like to have on the CD. (See the ear-
lier section, “Keeping Slim Whitman and Slim Shady Apart: Organizing with
Playlists,” if you need a refresher.) With the songs in the correct order, select
the playlist. Click the Burn Disc button at the bottom of the iTunes window
to commence the disc burning process. iTunes lets you know when the
recording is complete.
Feasting on iTunes Visuals
By now, you know that iTunes is a feast for the ears, but did you know that it
can provide you with eye candy as well? With just a click or two, you can
view mind-bending graphics that stretch, move, and pulse with your music,
as shown in Figure 2-6.
Backing up within iTunes
iTunes offers a built-in backup feature for your
media library — I told you this was the best
media player ever designed!
Choose File➪Back Up to Disc to start the
process. You can choose to back up your entire
iTunes library and all your playlists (which I rec-
ommend) or just the content you’ve purchased
from the iTunes Store. Personally, if I lost every-
thing in my collection except for what I’ve
bought from the iTunes Store, I’d be just as
crushed . . . back it all up, and you won’t be
sorry
Click Back Up, and iTunes will prompt you for
blank CDs or DVDs. If you need to restore from
your completed backup, just launch iTunes and
load the first backup disc into your drive.
How often is often enough when it comes to
backing up your content? That depends com-
pletely on how often your media library
changes. The idea is to back up often enough
so that you always have a recent copy of your
media files close by.

To begin viewing iTunes visuals, choose View➪Turn On Visualizer (or press

playing groovy lava lamp-style animations (like, sassy, man). To stop the
visuals, choose View➪Turn Off Visualizer (or press Ô+T again). The usual
sunny aluminum face of iTunes returns.
You can also change the viewing size of the iTunes visuals in the View menu.
From the View menu item, choose Full Screen (or press Ô+F). To escape
from the Full Screen mode, click the mouse or press Esc.
You can still control iTunes with the keyboard while the visuals are zooming
around your screen. See Table 2-1 earlier in this chapter for a rundown on
common keyboard shortcuts.
The iTunes Visualizer has many hidden features. While viewing the Visualizer,
press H for Help to see a list of hidden Visualizer settings. Press H again 
(or ?), and the list changes to reveal more hidden functions.
But wait, more Easter eggs are to be found! Again, while viewing the Visualizer,

Press either of these keys repeatedly to cycle through the various patterns

ins available for downloading on Apple’s Web site and other Mac-related
download sites.
Buying Digital Media the Apple Way
Before we wave goodbye to the happy residents of iTunes iSland, I won’t
forget to mention the hottest spot on the Internet for buying music and
video: the iTunes Store, which you can reach from the cozy confines of
iTunes. (That is, as long as you have an Internet connection. If you don’t, it’s
time to turn the page to a different chapter.) If you’re not in iTunes, go to
www.apple.com/itunes/store.
Figure 2-7 illustrates the lobby of this online audio/video store. Click the
iTunes Store item in the Source list, and after a few moments you’re pre-
sented with the latest offerings. Click a link in the store list to browse
according to media type, or click the Power Search link to search by song
title, artist, album, or composer. The Back/Forward buttons at the top of the
iTunes Store window operate much like those in Safari, moving you back-
ward or forward in sequence through pages that you’ve already seen.
Clicking the Home button (which, through no great coincidence, looks like a
miniature house) takes you back to the Store’s main page.
To display the details on a specific album or track, just click it. If you’re
interested in buying just certain tracks (for that perfect road warrior mix),
you get to listen to 30 seconds of any track — for free, no less, and at full
sound quality. To add an item to your iTunes Store shopping cart, click the
Add Song/Movie/Album/Video/Podcast button (sheesh!). When you’re ready
to buy, click the Shopping Cart item in the Source list and then click the Buy
Now button. (At the time of this writing, tracks are 99 cents a pop, and an
entire album is typically $9.99 . . . what a bargain! As I mentioned earlier in
the chapter, Apple now offers iTunes Plus tracks, which are higher in quality
and aren’t hobbled with copy protection — these tracks are $1.29 each.)
The iTunes Store creates an account for you based on your e-mail address,
and it also keeps secure track of your credit card information for future pur-
chases. After you use the iTunes Store once, you never have to log in or
retype your credit card information again.

The tracks and files that you download are saved to a separate playlist
called Purchased. After the download is finished, you can play them, move
them to other playlists, burn them to CD or DVD, share ’em over your net-
work. or ship them to your iPod, just like any other item in your iTunes
Library.
Remember all those skeptics who claimed that buying digital audio and
video could never work over the Internet because of piracy issues and high
costs? Well, bunkie, hats off to Apple: Once again, our favorite technology

F
or years, the Macintosh has been the choice of professional photogra-
phers for working with digital images — not surprising, considering the
Mac’s graphical nature. Apple continues this tradition with iPhoto, a photog-
raphy tool for the home user that can help you organize, edit, and even pub-
lish your photographs. (It sports more features than a handful of Swiss army
knives.) After you shoot your photos with a digital camera, you can import
them into iPhoto, edit them, and publish them. You’re not limited to photos
that you take yourself, either; you can edit, publish, and organize all kinds of
digital image files. You can even create a photo album and use the iPhoto
interface to order a handsome hard-bound copy shipped to you.
In this chapter, I walk you through an overview of what iPhoto can do. After
that, I give you a brief tour of the controls within iPhoto so you can see what
features are available to you, including features for managing, printing, and
publishing your photos.
Delving into iPhoto
In Figure 3-1, you can see most of the major controls offered in iPhoto.
(Other controls automatically appear when you enter different modes — 
I cover them in upcoming sections of this chapter.)
Although these controls and sections of the window are covered in more
detail in the following sections, here’s a quick rundown of what you’re 
looking at:
✦Source list: This list of image locations determines which photos iPhoto
displays.
• You can choose to display either your entire image library or just
the last “roll” of digital images that you downloaded from your
camera.

• You can create new albums of your own that appear in the source
list; albums make it much easier to organize your photos.
• You can create books, calendars, cards and slideshows.
✦Viewer: This pane displays the images from the currently selected
photo source.
You can drag or click to select photos in the Viewer for further tricks,
such as assigning keywords and image editing.
✦Create button: Click this button to add a new blank album, book, calen-
dar, card, or slideshow to your source list.

rently selected photos.

✦Enter Full Screen button: Click this button to switch to a full-screen dis-
play of your photos. In full-screen mode, the images in the selected
album appear in a film strip across the top of the screen, and you can
click one to view that image using your laptop’s entire screen real estate.
You can also use the same controls that I discuss later in this chapter for
editing and adjusting images — just move the mouse cursor to the top
edge of the full-screen display to show the menu or to the bottom edge
to show the toolbar.
✦Play Slideshow: Select an event, album, book or slideshow in the Source
list and click this button to start a full-screen slideshow using those
images.
✦Search box: Click the button next to the Search text box to locate
photos by specific criteria, or just click in the box and start typing to
search by description and title.
✦Toolbar buttons: This group of buttons selects an operation you want to
perform on the images you’ve selected in the Viewer.
✦Thumbnail Resize slider: Drag this slider to the left to reduce the size of
the thumbnails in the Viewer. This allows you to see more thumbnails at
once, which is a great boon for quick visual searches. Drag the slider to
the right to expand the size of the thumbnails, which makes it easier to
differentiate details between similar photos in the Viewer.
Working with Images in iPhoto
Even a superbly designed image display and editing application, like iPhoto,
would look overwhelming if everything were jammed into one window. Thus,
Apple’s developers provide different operation modes (such as editing and
book creation) that you can use in the one iPhoto window. Each mode allows
you to perform different tasks, and you can switch modes at just about any
time by clicking the corresponding toolbar button.
In this section, I discuss three of these modes — import, organize, and edit —
and what you can do when you’re in them. Then I conclude the chapter with
sections on publishing and sharing your images.
Import Images 101
In import mode, you’re ready to download images directly from your digital
camera — as long as your specific camera model is supported in iPhoto. 
You can find out which cameras are supported by visiting the Apple iPhoto
support page at www.apple.com/macosx/upgrade/cameras.html.

Working with Images in iPhoto
290
Follow these steps to import images:
1. Connect your digital camera to your laptop.
Plug one end of a USB cable into your camera and the other end into
your Mac’s USB port, and prepare your camera to download images.
2. Launch iPhoto.
Launch iPhoto by clicking its icon in the dock (or in your Applications
folder).
3. Type an event name for the imported photos, like “Birthday Party” or
“Godzilla Ravages Tokyo”.
4. Type a description for the roll.
5. To allow iPhoto to automatically separate images into separate events
based on the date they were taken, click the Autosplit Events after
importing checkbox to enable it.
6. Click the Import button to import your photographs from the camera.
The images are added to your Photo Library, where you can organize
them into individual albums or Events.
To select specific images to import, hold down the Command key and
click each desired photo, then click Import Selected instead of Import All.
7. Specify whether the images you’re importing should be deleted from
the camera afterwards.
If you don’t expect to download these images again to another computer
or another device, you can choose to delete the photos from your
camera automatically. This saves you a step and helps eliminate the
guilt that can crop up when you nix your pix. (Sorry, I couldn’t resist.)
Importing images from your hard drive
If you have a folder of images that you’ve col-
lected already on your hard drive, a CD, a DVD,
an external drive, or a USB Flash drive, adding
them to your library is easy. Just drag the folder
from a Finder window and drop it into the
source list in the iPhoto window. iPhoto auto-
matically creates a new album using the folder
name, and you can sit back while the images
are imported into that new album. iPhoto rec-
ognizes images in several formats: JPEG, GIF,
RAW, PNG, PICT, and TIFF.
If you have individual images, you can drag
them as well. Select the images in a Finder
window and drag them into the desired album
in the source list. To add them to the album 
currently displayed in the Viewer, drag the
selected photos and drop them in the Viewer
instead.
If you’d rather import images by using a stan-
dard Mac Open dialog box, choose File➪Import
to Library. Simplicity strikes again!

“What’s that about an Event, Mark?” After you download the contents of
your digital camera, those contents count as a virtual Event in iPhoto —
based on either the date that you imported them or the date they were
taken. For example, you can always display the last images you imported by
clicking Last Import. If you want to see photos from your son’s graduation,
they appear as a separate Event. (Both of these organizational tools will
appear in the source list). Think about that . . . it’s pretty tough to arrange
old-fashioned film prints by the moment in time that they document, but
iPhoto makes it easy for you to see just which photos are part of the same
group! I’ll explain more about Events in the next section.
There are two methods of organizing photos: the album, which you may be
familiar with from older versions of iPhoto, and Events, which are new in 
version 7.
Organize mode: Organizing and sorting your images
In the days of film prints, you could always stuff another shoebox with your
latest photos or buy another sticky album to expand your library. Your digi-
tal camera, though, stores images as files instead, and many folks don’t print
their digital photographs. Instead, you can keep your entire collection of 
digital photographs and scanned images well ordered and easily retrieved by
using iPhoto’s organize mode. Then you can display them as a slideshow,
print them to your system printer, use them as Desktop backgrounds, or
burn them to an archive disc.
A new kind of photo album
The key to organizing images in iPhoto is the album. Each album can repre-
sent any division you like, be it a year, a vacation, your daughter, or your
daughter’s ex-boyfriends. Follow these steps:
1. Create a new album.
You can either choose File➪New Album or click the plus (+) button at
the bottom of the source list. The New Album sheet appears, as shown
in Figure 3-2.
2. Type the name for your new photo album.
If you want to create an empty album (without using any images that
might be selected), make sure you click the Use selected items in new
album check box to disable it.
3. Click OK.

Working with Images in iPhoto
292
iPhoto also offers a special type of album called a Smart Album, which you
can create from the File menu. A Smart Album contains only photos that
match certain criteria that you choose, using the keywords and rating that
you assign your images. Other criteria include recent film rolls, text in the
photo filenames, dates the images were added to iPhoto, and any comments
you might have added. Now here’s the really nifty angle: iPhoto automatically
builds and maintains Smart Albums for you, adding new photos that match
the criteria (and deleting those that you remove from your Photo Library)!
Smart Albums carry a gear icon in the source list.
You can display information about the currently selected item in the infor-
mation panel under the source list — just click the Show Information button
at the bottom of the iPhoto window, which sports the familiar “i-in-a-circle”
logo. You can also type a short note or description in the Description box
that appears in the Information pane. For more in-depth information, select
the desired item and then press Ô+I.
You can also change information on an image by selecting it in the Viewer
and clicking the Show Information button — click on any of the headings in
the pane (Title, Date, Time and so on) to display a text edit box, so you can
simply click in either box to type a new name or alter the photo’s datestamp.
Figure 3-2:

Chapter 3

Working with Images in iPhoto
293
You can drag images from the Viewer into any album you choose. For exam-
ple, you can copy an image to another album by dragging it from the Viewer
to the desired album in the Source list.
To remove a photo that has fallen out of favor, follow these steps:
1. In the source list, select the desired album.
2. In the Viewer, select the photo (click it) that you want to remove.
3. Press Delete.
When you remove a photo from an album, you don’t remove the photo from
your collection (which is represented by the Photos entry under the Library
heading in the source list). That’s because an album is just a group of links
to the images in your collection. To completely remove the offending photo,
click the Photos entry under the Library heading to display your entire col-
lection of images and delete the picture there, too.
To remove an entire album from the source list, just click it in the source list
to select it — in the Viewer, you can see the images that it contains — and
then press Delete.
To rename an album, click on the entry under the Albums heading in the
Source list to select it, then click again to display a text box. Type the new
album name and press Return.
Change your mind? Daughter’s ex is back in the picture, so to speak? iPhoto
comes complete with a handy-dandy Undo feature. Just press Ô+Z, and it’s
like your last action never happened. (A great trick for those moments when
you realize you just deleted your only image of your first car from your
Library.)
Arranging stuff by Events
As I mentioned earlier, Events are essentially a group of images that you shot
or downloaded at the same time — iPhoto figures that those images belong
together (which is usually a pretty safe assumption). Figure 3-3 illustrates
the Events I’ve created in my iPhoto collection.
Like an album, an Event can be renamed — just using a different procedure.
Click the Events entry under the Library heading in the Source list to display
your Events in the Viewer, then click on the existing Event name in the cap-
tion underneath the thumbnail. A text box appears where you can type a
new name; click Return to update the Event.

Try moving your mouse cursor over an Event thumbnail in the Viewer, and
you’ll see that iPhoto displays the date range when the images were taken,
as well as the total number of images in the Event. Ah, but things get really
cool when you move your mouse cursor back and forth over an Event with
many images: the thumbnail animates and displays all of the images in the
Event, without using old-fashioned scroll bars or silly arrows! (Why can’t I
think of this stuff? This is the future, dear readers.)
To display the contents of an Event in the Viewer, just double-click on the
Event thumbnail. To return to the Events thumbnails, click on the All Events
button at the top of the Viewer.
Decided to merge those Prom Event pictures with your daughter’s
Graduation Event? No problem! You could drag one Event thumbnail on top
of another... but that’s the easy way. Alternately, click the Events entry under
the Library heading in the Source list to display your Events, then hold down
Command while you click the Events that you want to merge. Click the
Merge button in the toolbar at the bottom of the window, or click Events➪
Merge Events. (Forgot about that menu bar, didn’t you?) Click Merge in the
confirmation dialog that appears.

Whilst organizing, you can create a brand-new empty Event by clicking
Events➪Create Event. Feel free to drag photos from albums, other Events or
your Photo library into your new Event.
Organizing with keywords
“Okay, Mark, iPhoto albums and Events are great ideas, but do you really
expect me to look through 20 albums just to locate pictures with specific
people or places?” Never fear, good Mac owner. You can also assign descrip-
tive keywords to images to help you organize your collection and locate cer-
tain pictures fast. iPhoto comes with a number of standard keywords, and
you can create your own as well.
To illustrate, suppose you’d like to identify your images according to special
events in your family. Birthday photos should have their own keyword, and
anniversaries deserve another. By assigning keywords, you can search for
Elsie’s sixth birthday or your silver wedding anniversary (no matter what
Event or album they’re in), and all related photos with those keywords
appear like magic! (Well, almost like magic. You need to choose View➪
Keywords, which toggles the Keyword display on and off in the Viewer.)
iPhoto includes a number of keywords that are already available:
✦Favorite
✦Family
✦Kids
✦Vacation
✦Birthday
✦Grayscale
✦Widescreen
✦Checkmark
What’s the Checkmark all about, you ask? It’s a special case — adding this
keyword displays a tiny check mark icon in the bottom-right corner of the
image. The checkmark keyword comes in handy for temporarily identifying
specific images because you can search for just your check-marked photos.
To assign keywords to images (or remove keywords that have already been
assigned), select one or more photos in the Viewer. Choose Window➪Show
Keywords or press Command-K to display the Keywords window, as shown
in Figure 3-4.

Working with Images in iPhoto
296
Click the keyword buttons that you want to attach to the selected images to
mark them. Or, click the highlighted keyword buttons that you want to
remove from the selected images to disable them.
Digging through your library with keywords
Behold the power of keywords! To sift through your entire collection of
images by using keywords, click the magnifying glass button next to the
Search box at the bottom of the iPhoto window, then choose Keyword from
the pop-up menu. iPhoto displays a pop-up Keywords panel, and you can
click one or more keyword buttons to display just the photos that carry
those keywords.
The images that remain in the Viewer after a search must have all the key-
words that you specified. If an image is identified, for example, by only three
of four keywords you chose, it isn’t a match and it doesn’t appear in the
Viewer.

To search for a photo by words in its description, just click in the Search box
and start typing. You can also click that same magnifying glass by the Search
box to search through your images by date and rating as well. 
Speaking of ratings...
Playing favorites by assigning ratings
Be your own critic! iPhoto allows you to assign any photo a rating of any-
where from zero to five stars. I use this system to help me keep track of the
images that I feel are the best in my library. Select one (or more) image and
then assign a rating using one of the following methods:
✦Choose Photos➪My Rating and then choose the desired rating from the
pop-up submenu.
✦Use the Ô+0 through Ô+5 shortcuts.
Sorting your images just so
The The View menu provides an easy way to arrange your images in the
Viewer by a number of different criteria. Choose View➪Sort Photos and then
click the desired sort criteria from the pop-up submenu. You can arrange the
display by date, keyword, title, or rating. If you select an album in the source
list, you can also choose to arrange photos manually, which means that you
can drag and drop thumbnails in the Viewer to place them in the precise
order you want them.
You’re gonna need your own keywords
I’ll bet you take photos of other things besides
just kids and vacations — and that’s why iPhoto
allows you to create your own keywords.
Display the iPhoto Keywords window by press-
ing Ô+K, click the Edit Keywords button in the
toolbar, and then click Add (the button with the
plus sign). iPhoto adds a new unnamed key-
word to the list as an edit box, ready for you to
type its name.
You can rename an existing keyword from this
same window, too. Click a keyword to select it
and then click Rename. Remember, however,
that renaming a keyword affects all the images
that were tagged with that keyword. That might
be confusing when, for example, photos origi-
nally tagged as Family suddenly appear with
the keyword Foodstuffs. To remove an existing
keyword from the list, click the keyword to
select it and then click the Delete button, which
bears a minus sign.

Naturally, iPhoto allows you to print selected images, but you can also send
photos directly to iWeb for use on your .Mac Web site. Click the iWeb button
in the toolbar and choose either a Photo Page or a Blog page, and iPhoto
automatically sends the selected images or album to iWeb and launches the
application! You can also use iPhoto’s Web Gallery feature to get your photos
on the Web (more on the Web Gallery at the end of this chapter).
Edit mode: Removing and fixing stuff the right way
Not every digital image is perfect — just look at my collection if you need
proof. For those shots that need a pixel massage, iPhoto includes a number
of editing tools that you can use to correct common problems.
The first step in any editing job is to select the image you want to fix in the
Viewer. Then click the Edit button on the iPhoto toolbar to switch to the Edit
panel controls, as shown in Figure 3-5. Now you’re ready to fix problems,
using the tools that I discuss in the rest of this section. (If you’re editing a
photo that’s part of an Event or an album, note the spiffy scrolling photo
strip at the top, which allows you to switch to another image to edit just by
clicking.)

Rotating tipped-over shots
If an image is in the wrong orientation and needs to be turned to display cor-
rectly, click the Rotate button to turn it once in a counterclockwise direction.
Hold down the Option key while you click the Rotate button to rotate in a
clockwise direction.
Crop ’til you drop
Does that photo have an intruder hovering around the edges of the subject?
You can remove some of the border by cropping an image, just as folks once
did with film prints and a pair of scissors. (We’ve come a long way.) With
iPhoto, you can remove unwanted portions of an image — it’s a great way to
get Uncle Milton’s stray head (complete with toupee) out of an otherwise
perfect holiday snapshot.
Follow these steps to crop an image:
1. Click the Crop button in the Edit panel.
2. Select the portion of the image that you want to keep.
In the Viewer, click and drag the handles on the square to outline the
part of the image that you want. Remember, whatever’s outside this rec-
tangle disappears after the crop is completed.
When you drag a corner or edge of the outline, a semi-opaque grid
(familiar to amateur and professional photographers as the nine squares
from the Rule of Three) appears to help you visualize what you’re claim-
ing. (Check it out in Figure 3-6.)
3. (Optional) Choose a preset size.
If you want to force your cropped selection to a specific size — such as 
4 x 3 for an iDVD project — click the Constrain checkbox and select that
size from the Constrain pop-up menu.
4. Click the Apply button.
Oh, and don’t forget that you can use iPhoto’s Undo feature if you mess
up and need to try again — just press Ô+Z.
iPhoto features multiple Undo levels, so you can press Ô+Z several times to
travel back through your last several changes.
Enhancing images to add pizzazz
If a photo looks washed out, click the Enhance button to increase (or decrease)
the color saturation and improve the contrast. Enhance is automatic, so you
don’t have to set anything.

Removing rampant red-eye
Unfortunately, today’s digital cameras can still produce the same “zombies
with red eyeballs” as traditional film cameras. Red-eye is caused by a
camera’s flash reflecting off the retinas of a subject’s eyes, and it can occur
with both humans and pets.
iPhoto can remove that red-eye and turn frightening zombies back into your
family and friends! Click the Red-Eye button and then select a demonized
eyeball by clicking in the center of it. To complete the process, click the X in
the button that appears in the image.
Retouching like the stars
The iPhoto Retouch feature is perfect for removing minor flecks or lines in
an image (especially those you’ve scanned from prints). Click Retouch, and
you’ll notice that the mouse cursor turns into a crosshair — just drag the
cursor across the imperfection.

Switching to black-and-white or sepia
Ever wonder whether a particular photo in your library would look better as
a black-and-white (or grayscale) print? Or perhaps an old-fashioned sepia
tone in shades of copper and brown? Just click the Effects button to convert
an image from color to shades of gray or shades of brown, respectively.
Adjusting brightness and contrast manually
Click Adjust to perform manual adjustments on brightness and contrast (the
light levels in your image). To adjust the brightness and contrast, make sure
that nothing’s selected in the image and then drag the Brightness/Contrast
sliders until the image looks the way that you want.
While you’re editing, you can use the Next and Previous buttons to move to
the next image in the current album (or back to the previous image).
Producing Your Own Coffee-Table Masterpiece
Book mode unleashes what I think is probably the coolest feature of iPhoto:
the chance to design and print a high-quality bound photo book! After you
complete an album — all the images have been edited just the way you want,
and the album contains all the photos you want to include in your book —
iPhoto can send your images as data over the Internet to a company that
prints and binds your finished book for you. (No, they don’t publish For
Dummies titles, but then again, I don’t get high-resolution color plates in
most of my books, either.)
At the time of this writing, you can order many different sizes and bindings,
including an 8.5-by-11-inch soft-cover book with 20 double-sided pages for
about $20 and a hardbound 8.5-by-11-inch keepsake album with 10 double-
sided pages for about $30 (shipping included for both). Extra pages can be
added at $0.70 and $1.00 a pop, respectively.
iPhoto ‘08 can also produce and automatically order calendars and greeting
cards, using a process similar to the one I describe in this section for pro-
ducing a book. Who needs that stationery store in the mall anymore?
If you’re going to create a photo book, make sure that the images have the
highest quality and highest resolution. The higher the resolution, the better
the photos look in the finished book. I personally always try to use images of
over 1000 pixels in both the vertical and horizontal dimensions.

To create a photo book, follow these steps:
1. Click the desired album in the source list to select it.
2. Click the Book toolbar button.
3. Select the size of the book and a theme.
Your choices determine the number of pages and layout scheme, as well
as the background graphics for each page.
4. Click Choose Theme.
iPhoto displays a dialog box asking whether you want to lay out your
photos manually or allow iPhoto to do everything automatically.
Automatic mode is fine, but I’m a thorough guy, so I’ll lay out this book
manually. You’ll see the controls shown in Figure 3-7.
In Book mode, the Viewer changes in subtle ways. It displays the current
page at the bottom of the display and adds a scrolling row of thumbnail
images above it. This row of images represents the remaining images

from the selected album that you can add to your book. You can drag
any image thumbnail into one of the photo placeholders to add it to 
the page. You can also click the Page button at the left of the thumbnail
strip — it looks like a page with a turned-down corner — to display
thumbnails of each page in your book. (To return to the album image
strip, click the Photos button under the Page button.)
5. Rearrange the page order to suit you by dragging the thumbnail of
any page from one location to another in the strip.
6. In the Book toolbar below the page view, you can adjust a variety of
settings for the final book, including the book’s theme, background,
page numbers, and text fonts.
At this point, you can also add captions and short descriptions to the
pages of your photo album. Click any one of the text boxes in the page
display and begin typing to add text to that page.
I really need a slideshow
You can use iPhoto to create slideshows! Click
the album you want to display and click the Add
button, then choose Slideshow from the toolbar
and click Create; notice that iPhoto adds a
Slideshow item in the source list. The same
scrolling thumbnail strip appears at the top of
the Viewer — this time displaying the images
in the album. Click and drag the thumbnails so
that they appear in the desired order.
To choose background music for your
slideshow, click the Music button in the
Slideshow toolbar to display the tracks from
your iTunes library. Drag the individual songs
you want to the song list at the bottom of the
sheet — you can drag them to rearrange their
order in the list as well. Click OK to accept your
song list.
To configure your slideshow, click the Settings
button in the Slideshow toolbar. In the sheet
that appears, you can specify the amount of
time that each slide remains on the screen, as
well as an optional title and rating displays. I
can recommend the Automatic Ken Burns
effect — yep, the same one in iMovie — which
lends an animated movement to each image.
Widescreen laptop owners appreciate the
Slideshow Format pop-up menu, which allows
you to choose a 16:9 widescreen display for
your slideshow.
Click the Adjust button to modify the settings for
a specific slide (useful for keeping a slide
onscreen for a longer period of time or for set-
ting a different transition than the default tran-
sition you choose from the Slideshow toolbar).
To display a preview of a single slide and its
transitions, click the desired slide and then
click Preview; this is a handy way of determin-
ing whether your delay and transition settings
are really what you want for a particular slide.
When you’re ready to play your slideshow, click
the Play button, and iPhoto switches to full-
screen mode. You can share your completed
slideshow by clicking Share in the iPhoto menu,
where you can send the slideshow to iDVD 
(for later burning onto a DVD), export it as a
QuickTime movie, or send it through e-mail.

7. When you’re ready to publish your book, click the Buy Book button.
8. In a series of dialog boxes that appear, iPhoto guides you through the
final steps to order a bound book.
Note that you’re asked for credit card information
I wouldn’t attempt to order a book through a dialup modem connection. The
images are likely far too large to be sent successfully. If possible, use a
broadband or network connection to the Internet while you’re ordering. If
your only connection to the Internet is through a dialup modem, I recom-
mend saving your book in PDF format and having it printed at a copy shop
or printing service instead. (Choose File➪Print and then click the Save as
PDF button.)
Introducing Web Gallery!
iPhoto ‘08 introduces a new feature called Web Gallery that does for images
what podcasting does for audio: You can share your photos with friends,
family, business clients and anyone else with an Internet connection! (Your
adoring public doesn’t even require a Mac; they can use That Other Kind of
Computer.) iPhoto automatically uploads the selected images and leads you
through the process of creating a new Web page to proudly display your
photos. However, you must be a .Mac subscriber to use the Web Gallery fea-
ture — if you haven’t heard the news on Apple’s .Mac service yet, see
Chapter 4 of Book IV for the details.
To create a Web Gallery, you designate one or more albums to share by
selecting them in the source list and then clicking the Add button. (Hold
down Command as you click to select multiple albums.) Click the Web
Gallery toolbar button in the sheet that appears to display the Web Gallery
settings, shown in Figure 3-8.
Type a name for your new Web Gallery. You can elect to show the title of
each photo, allow your visitors to download your images or upload their
own, and even allow photos to be uploaded by other Mac owners using
Apple Mail!
By default, any visitor to your .Mac Web site can see your gallery. But what if
you prefer a little security for those images? In that case, click the Album
Viewable by pop-up menu, where you can limit your viewing audience (you
can even require that your visitors enter a login name and password before
they can receive your photos).

Focusing on iPhoto
Introducing Web Gallery!
305
Click Publish, and you’ll see that iPhoto indicates your images are being
uploaded with a cool twirling progress icon to the right of the album in the
source list. When the process is complete, iPhoto indicates that the album is
being “photocasted” with a special networky-looking icon to the right of the
album, and even a new Web Gallery heading in the Source list. You’re on 
the air!
Now for the other side of the coin: By selecting your Web Gallery in the
Source list and clicking Tell a Friend in the iPhoto toolbar, iPhoto automati-
cally prepares an e-mail message in Apple Mail that announces your new
Web Gallery! Just add the recipient names and click Send. This spiffy mes-
sage includes instructions for
✦Folks using iPhoto ‘08 on a Mac: As you can imagine, this is the easiest
receive option to configure. After these folks are subscribed, they get an
automatically updated album of the same name that appears in their
source list, and they can use those images in their own iPhoto projects!
From within iPhoto, your visitors can subscribe to your Web Gallery by
clicking File➪Subscribe to Photo Feed and entering the subscription URL.

✦Folks using Windows or an older version of iPhoto: These subscribers
can use any Web browser with RSS support (like the Safari browser that
comes with Leopard) or any RSS reader. (In effect, your Web Gallery
becomes an RSS feed for those without iPhoto ‘08.)
By default, any changes you make to the contents of the albums in your Web
Gallery are updated automatically on your .Mac account, and in turn, are
updated automatically to everyone who receives your images. You can turn
this feature off, however, if you have a large number of images and you
update often (which can result in your sister’s computer downloading a lot
of data).  To display the Check for new photos setting for Web Gallery, click
iPhoto➪Preferences and click the Web Gallery button on the Preferences
window toolbar. (You can also change the title for your Gallery and monitor
your iDisk usage from this pane.)
Mailing Photos to Aunt Mildred
iPhoto can help you send your images through e-mail by automating the
process. The application can prepare your image and embed it automatically
in a new message.
To send an image through e-mail, select it and then click the Email button in
the toolbar. The dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-9, appears, allowing you to
choose the size of the images and whether you want to include their titles
and comments as well.
Keep in mind that most ISP (Internet service provider) e-mail servers don’t
accept an e-mail message that’s more than 1MB or 2MB, so watch that Size
display. If you’re trying to send a number of images and the size goes over
2MB, you might have to click the Size pop-up menu and choose a smaller
size (reducing the image resolution) to get them all embedded in a single
message.
When you’re satisfied with the total file size and you’re ready to create your
message, click the Compose button. iPhoto automatically launches Apple
Mail (or whatever e-mail application you specify) and creates a new message
containing the images, ready for you to click Send!

A
lfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, George Lucas, and Ridley Scott —
those guys are amateurs! Welcome to the exciting world of movie
making on your Mac, where you call the shots. With iMovie, you can try 
your hand at all aspects of the movie-creating process, including editing and
special effects. Built with ease-of-use in mind, iMovie lets you perform full-
blown movie production on your Macintosh with a minimum of effort.
Don’t let iMovie’s fancy buttons and flashing lights fool you: This application
is a feature-packed tool for serious movie production. The iMovie controls
work the same as many top-notch, movie-editing tools that professionals
use. From basic editing to audio and video effects, iMovie has everything
that you need to get started creating high-quality movies.
The iMovie Window
If you’ve ever tried a professional-level video editing application, you probably
felt like you were suddenly dropped in the cockpit of a jumbo jet. In iMovie,
though, all the controls you need are easy to use and logically placed.
Video editing takes up quite a bit of desktop space. In fact, you can’t run
iMovie at resolutions less than 1024 x 768, nor would you want to.
To launch iMovie, click the iMovie icon on the Dock. (It looks like a direc-
tor’s clapboard.) You can also click the Application folder in any Finder
window sidebar and then double-click the iMovie icon.
To follow the examples I show you here, follow these strenuous steps and
create a new movie project:

The iMovie Window

1. Click the Create a New Project button.
iMovie displays the sheet you see in Figure 4-1.
2. Type a name for your project.
3. Select the aspect ratio (or screen dimensions) for your movie.
You can select a widescreen display (16:9), a standard display (4:3) or 
a display especially suited for an iPhone (3:2). If compatibility with the
familiar SDTV format is important, I always recommend that you choose
standard (4:3) ratio.
4. Click Create.
You’re on your way! Check out Figure 4-2: This is the whole enchilada, in
one window.
The controls and displays that you’ll use most often follow:

appears when you click the Transitions Browser button (go figure).
✦Event pane: All the video clips that you use to create your movie are
stored in the Event pane. I show you what each of the panes in the Tools
palette looks like when you tackle different tasks in this chapter.
✦Project pane: iMovie displays the elements that you’ve added to your

A Bird’s-Eye View of Moviemaking
I don’t want to box in your creative skills here — after all, you can attack 
the moviemaking process from a number of angles. (Pun unfortunately
intended.) However, I’ve found that my movies turn out the best when I
follow a linear process, so before I dive into specifics, allow me to provide
you with an overview of moviemaking with iMovie.
Here’s my take on the process, reduced to seven steps:
1. Import your video clips either directly from your DV camcorder,
iSight camera or from your hard drive.
2. Drag your new selection of clips from the Event pane to the Project
pane and arrange them in the desired order.
3. Import or record audio clips (from iTunes, GarageBand, or external
sources, such as audio CDs or audio files, you’ve recorded yourself)
and add them to your movie.
4. Import your photos (directly from iPhoto or from your hard drive)
and place them where needed in your movie.
5. Add professional niceties, such as audio, transitions, effects, and text
to the project.
6. Preview your film and edit it further if necessary.
7. Share your finished film with others through the Web, e-mail, or a
DVD that you create and burn with iDVD.
That’s the first step-by-step procedure in this chapter. I doubt that you’ll
even need to refer back to it, however, because you’ll soon see just how easy
it is to use iMovie.
Importing the Building Blocks
Sure, you need video clips to create a movie of your own, but don’t panic if
you have but a short supply. You can certainly turn to the other iLife applica-
tions for additional raw material. (See, I told you that integration thing would
come in handy.)

Book III
Chapter 4
Making Magic

313
Importing the Building Blocks
Along with video clips you import from your DV camcorder, iSight camera,
and hard drive, you can also call on iPhoto for still images (think credits)
and iTunes for background audio and effects. In this section, I show you how.
Pulling in video clips
Your Mac is probably equipped already with the two extras that come in
handy for video editing: namely, a large hard drive and a FireWire port.
Because virtually all DV camcorders today use a FireWire connection to
transfer clips, you’re all set. (And even if your snazzy new DV camcorder
uses a USB 2.0 connection, you’re still in the zone!) Oh, and if your Mac 
has an iSight camera on board, you’re a self-contained movie studio!
Here’s the drill if your clips are on your DV camcorder:
1. Plug the proper cable into your Mac.
2. Set the DV camcorder to VTR (or VCR) mode.
Some camcorders call this Play mode.
3. Click the Camera Import button (labeled in Figure 4-2).
iMovie opens a new window.
4. Click the Camera pop-up menu and select your DV camcorder or
iSight camera.
Playback controls appear under the Camera Import window, mirroring
the controls on your DV camcorder. This allows you to control the unit
from iMovie. Keen! You also get Import All and Import Checked buttons
as a bonus.
5. To import selected clips, set the Automatic/Manual switch to Manual.
To import all clips, set the Automatic/Manual switch to Automatic, and
click Import All.
6. Click the check boxes next to the clips that you don’t want to import
to disable them.
7. Click the Import Checked button.
8. Click the Save To pop-up menu and choose the drive that should store
your clips.
You can choose to add the new clips to an existing Event, or create a
new Event. Heck, if the event spanned more than one day, you can create
a new Event for each day. (How do they think up these things?)
9. Click OK and admire your handiwork.
iMovie begins transferring the footage to your Mac and automatically adds
the imported clips to your Event Library.

Importing the Building Blocks

If your clips are already on your hard drive, rest assured that iMovie can
import them, including those in high-definition video (HDV) format. iMovie
also recognizes a number of other video formats, as shown in Table 4-1.

To import a movie file, follow this bouncing ball:
1. Choose File➪Import Movies.
2. If you’re importing 1080i video clips, choose the quality setting.
The Large setting will save you a significant amount of hard drive space.
(If you’re not importing 1080i video, use the default Large setting and
click OK.)
3. Click the Save To pop-up menu and choose the drive that should store
your clips.
4. Specify whether you want to add the imported video to an existing
Event, or whether you’d like to create a new Event.
If you choose to add the video to an existing Event, click the pop-up
menu and select an Event.
5. Specify whether you want to copy the video (leaving the original
movie intact), or whether the original movie should be deleted after a
successful import.
6. Click Import.
Alternatively, you can also drag a video clip from a Finder window and
drop it in the Project pane.
Making use of still images
Still images come in handy as impressive-looking titles or as ending credits
to your movie. (Make sure you list a gaffer and a best boy to be truly profes-
sional.) However, you can use still images also to introduce scenes or to 
separate clips according to your whim. For example, I use stills when 
delineating the days of a vacation within a movie or different Christmas 
celebrations over time.

Importing the Building Blocks
Here are two methods of adding stills to your movie:
✦Adding images from iPhoto: Click the Photo Browser button in the
Browser toolbar (or press Command-2), and you’ll experience the thrill
that is your iPhoto library, right from iMovie (as shown in Figure 4-3).
You can elect to display your entire iPhoto library or more selective
picks like specific albums or Events. When you find the image you want
to add, just drag it to the right spot in the Project pane.
✦Importing images from your hard drive: If you’re a member of the
International Drag-and-Drop society, you can drag TIFF, JPEG, GIF, PICT,
PNG, and PSD images directly from a Finder window and drop them into
the Project pane as well.
Importing and adding audio from all sorts of places
You can pull in everything from Wagner to Weezer as both background music
and sound effects for your movie. In this section, I focus on how to get those
notes into iMovie and then how to add them to your movie by dragging them
to the Project pane.

Narration the easy way
Ready to create that award-winning nature
documentary? You can add voice-over narra-
tion to your iMovie project that would make
Jacques Cousteau proud. In fact, you can
record your voice while you watch your movie
playing, allowing perfect synchronization with
the action! To add narration, follow these steps:
1. If you’re not already using the Timeline
viewer, click the Clip viewer/Timeline
viewer switch.
2. Drag the playhead in the Timeline viewer
to the point where the narration should
begin.
3. Click the Media button on the Tools
palette.
4. Click the Audio button.
5. Click the Play button in the monitor play-
back controls.
6. Click the Record button in the Audio pane.
You can monitor the volume level of your
voice with the Microphone meter.
7. Watch the video while you narrate so that
you can coordinate your narration track
with the action.
8. Click Stop in the Audio pane.
iMovie adds your recorded audio in the
Timeline viewer. If you need to try again, press
Delete to remove the audio clip and repeat the
steps.
1. Click the Voiceover button in the Editing
toolbar — it sports a microphone icon —
to open the Voiceover window.
2. Click the Record From pop-up menu and
select the input device.
Most Macs sport a decent internal micro-
phone, but you can always add a USB
microphone to your system.
3. Drag the input volume slider to a comfort-
able level.
You can monitor the volume level of your
voice with the left and right input meters —
try to keep the meters at 50% or so for the
proper volume level.
4. To block out ambient noise levels around
you, drag the Noise Reduction slider to the
right if necessary.
If you’d like iMovie to enhance your voice
electronically for a more professional sound,
click the Voice Enhancement check box to
enable it. If you need to hear the audio from
your movie project while you speak, click
the Play project audio while recording
check box to enable it — note, however, that
you’ll need to listen to the audio while using
a set of headphones (plugged into your
Mac’s headphone jack) to avoid feedback
problems.
5. Click in the desired spot within the Project
pane where the narration should begin.
6. Begin speaking when prompted by iMovie.
7. Watch the video while you narrate so that
you can coordinate your narration track
with the action.
8. Click anywhere in the iMovie window to
stop recording.
iMovie adds an icon to the Project pane
underneath the video with the voiceover.
9. Click the Close button in the Voiceover
window.

Importing the Building Blocks
You can add audio from a number of sources:
✦Adding songs from iTunes: Click the Show Music and Sound Effects
button in the Browser toolbar (or press Command-1) to display the 
contents of your iTunes library. Click the desired playlist in the scrolling
list box, like the Dinah Washington playlist I selected in Figure 4-4. 
(If you’ve exported any original music you’ve composed in GarageBand
to your iTunes Library, you can use those songs in your own movie!) 
You can add a track to your movie by dragging the song entry from 
the Muisc and Sound Effects list to the desired spot in the Project pane.
✦Adding sound effects: Yep, if you need the sound of a horse galloping
for your Rocky Mountain vacation clips, click either iMovie ‘08 Sound
Effects or iLife Sound Effects in the scrolling list box. iMovie includes a
number of top-shelf audio effects that you can use in the second audio
track on the timeline viewer. This way, you can add sound effects even
when you’ve already added a background song. Again, to add a sound
effect, drag it to the perfect spot in the Project pane.

If you have several gigabytes of music in your iTunes library, it might be
more of a challenge to locate “Me and Bobby McGee” by Janis Joplin,
especially if she’s included in a compilation. Let your Mac do the digging
for you! Click in the Search box below the track list and begin typing a
song name. iMovie narrows down the song titles displayed to those that
match the characters you type. To reset the search box and display all
your songs in the library or selected playlist, click the X icon that
appears to the right of the box.
✦Ripping songs from an audio CD: Load an audio CD and then choose
Audio CD from the scrolling list box. iMovie displays the tracks from the
CD, and you can add them at the current playhead position the same
way as iTunes songs.
✦Recording directly from a microphone: Yep, if you’re thinking voice-
over narration, you’ve hit the nail on the head. Check out the sidebar,
“Narration the easy way,” for the scoop.
You can fine-tune both the audio within a video clip or the audio clips
that you add to your project. With the desired clip selected, click the
Adjust Audio button in the Editing toolbar. The Audio Adjustments
window that appears includes an array of audio controls that allow you
to change the volume of the selected clip, or give that audio priority
over other audio playing simultaneously (such as a sound effect that
needs to be clearly heard over background music and the video clip). If
your clips dramatically vary in volume, click the Normalize Clip Volume
button, then select each clip that you want to set to the same volume
and click Normalize Clip Volume again for each clip. When you’re done
tweaking, click Done. (Oh, and don’t forget that you can always return
the clip to its original volume... just open this window again and click
Revert to Original.)
Building the Cinematic Basics
Time to dive in and add the building blocks to create your movie. Along with
video clips, audio tracks, and still images, you can add Hollywood-quality
transitions, optical effects, and animated text titles. In this section, I demon-
strate how to elevate your collection of video clips into a real-life furshlug-
giner movie.
Adding clips to your movie
You can add clips to your movie by using the Project pane and the Event
pane. The Dynamic Duo work like this:

Book III
Chapter 4
Making Magic 
with iMovie
319
Building the Cinematic Basics
✦Project pane: This displays the media you’ve added to your project so
far, allowing you to rearrange the clips, titles, transitions and still images
in your movie.
✦Event pane: This displays your video clips arranged by Event (the date
they were shot, or the date they were imported), acting as the source
repository for all of your clips. Movies pulled in to iMovie, imported to
iPhoto or added manually from the Finder appear here.
To add a clip to your movie
1. Move your mouse pointer across clips in the Event pane to watch a
preview of the video.
2. When you’ve decided what to add to your project, you can either add
the entire clip or a selection.
• To select an entire clip, right-click on the clip thumbnail and choose
Select Entire Clip from the menu that appears.
• To select a portion of a clip, drag your mouse cursor across the
thumbnail. A yellow frame appears around your selection. To change
the length of the selected video, drag the handles that appear on
either side. If you make a mistake while selecting video, just click 
any empty space within the Event pane to remove the selection
frame and try again.
3. Drag the selection from the Event pane to the spot where it belongs in
the Project pane.
Alternately, you can press the E key, or click the Add to Project button
(the first button in the Editing toolbar).
Do this several times, and you have a movie, just like the editors of old used
to do with actual film clips. This is a good point to mention a moviemaking
Mark’s Maxim:
Preview your work — and do it often.™
iMovie offers two Play Full screen buttons: one under the Event Library, and
one under the Project Library. Select the project or Event you want to play,
then click the corresponding button. You can also choose View➪Play Full
Screen to watch the selection. Press the space bar to pause, and press the
Esc to return to iMovie. You can also move your mouse to display a filmstrip
that you can click to skip forward or backward in the project or Event.
To play a selection from the Playhead position, press Command-G. (If you’ve
ever watched directors at work on today’s movie sets, they’re constantly
watching a monitor to see what things will look like for the audience. You
have the same option in iMovie!)

Building the Cinematic Basics
320
While you’re watching video in the Event pane, you may decide that a cer-
tain clip has a favorite scene... or that another clip has material you don’t
want, like Uncle Ed’s shadow puppets. (Shudder.) iMovie ‘08 introduces
Favorite and Rejected scenes, allowing you to view and use your best camera
work (and ignore the worst stuff). To mark video, select a range of frames or
an entire clip, then click the Mark as Favorite button in the Editing toolbar.
Click the Reject button to hide the selected video or frames from view. (You
can always unmark a Favorite scene using the Unmark button in the Editing
toolbar.)
Removing clips from your movie
Don’t like a clip? Bah. To banish a clip from your movie, follow these steps
1. Click the offending clip in the Project pane to select it.
2. Press Delete.
Alternately, you can right-click on the clip (or a selection you’ve made
by dragging) and choose either Delete Entire Clip or Delete Selection
from the menu that appears.
If you remove the wrong clip, don’t panic. Instead, use iMovie’s Undo feature
(press Ô+Z) to restore it.
Reordering clips in your movie
If Day One of your vacation appears after Day Two, you can easily reorder
your clips and stills by dragging them to the proper space in the Clip viewer.
When you release the mouse, iMovie automatically moves the rest of your
movie aside with a minimum of fuss and bother.
Editing clips in iMovie
If a clip has extra seconds of footage at the beginning or end, you don’t want
that superfluous stuff in your masterpiece. Our favorite video editor gives
you the following functions:
✦Crop: Removes unwanted material from a video clip or still image, 
allowing you to change the aspect ratio of the media
✦Rotate: Rotates a clip or image on its center axis
✦Trim: Trims frames from a video clip
Before you can edit, however, you have to select a section of a clip:

Book III
Chapter 4
Making Magic 
with iMovie
321
Building the Cinematic Basics
1. Click a clip or image in either the Project pane or the Event pane to
display it in the monitor.
2. To select the entire clip or image, simply click on it.
3. Drag your mouse cursor across the thumbnail to select the section of
the media you want to edit. (Note that some editing functions will
automatically apply to the entire clip, like Crop and Rotate.)
The selected region is surrounded by a yellow frame. You’re ready to
edit that selected part of the clip.
Note the handles that appear at the beginning or ending of the selection. You
can make fine changes to the selected section by dragging them.
✦To crop: Click the Crop button in the Edit toolbar to display the frame in
the Monitor pane, then click Crop at the top of the Monitor pane. Drag
the edges of the frame and the handles to select the section you want to
keep. To preview your selection, click the Play button at the top of the
monitor. When you’re ready, click Done and everything but the selected
region is removed.
✦To rotate: Click the Crop button in the Edit toolbar, then click one of 
the two rotation buttons (which carry a curved arrow icon). Each click
rotates the media 90 degrees in that direction. Click Done when the clip
or image is properly oriented.
✦To trim: Choose Edit➪Trim to Selection. iMovie removes the frames
from around the selected video.
Edits that you make to one clip or still image can actually be copied to multi-
ple items!  Select the edited clip and click Edit➪Copy from the iMovie menu —
now you can select one or more clips and use the Edit➪Paste Adjustments
menu to apply Video, Audio or Crop edits. (To apply all three type of edits, 
just choose All.)
Transitions for the masses
Many iMovie owners approach transitions as visual bookends: They merely
act as placeholders that appear between video clips. Nothing could be far-
ther from the truth because judicious use of transitions can make or break a
scene. For example, which would you prefer after a wedding ceremony — an
abrupt, jarring cut to the reception or a gradual fadeout to the reception?
Today’s audiences are sensitive to transitions between scenes. Try not to
overuse the same transition. Also weigh the visual impact of a transition
carefully.

Building the Cinematic Basics
322
iMovie includes a surprising array of transitions, including old favorites
(such as Fade In and Dissolve) and some nifty stuff you might not be familiar
with (such as Cube and Page Curl). To display your transition collection
(Figure 4-5), click the Show Transitions button on the Browser toolbar (or
press Command-4).
To see what a particular transition looks like, move your mouse pointer over
the thumbnail to display the transition in minature.
Adding a transition couldn’t be easier: Drag the transition from the list in the
Transitions Browser pane and drop it between clips or between a clip and a
still image in the Project pane. In iMovie ‘08, transitions are applied in real time.
Even Gone With the Wind had titles
The last stop on our iMovie Hollywood Features Tour is the Titles Browser,
shown in Figure 4-6. You’ll find it by clicking the Title button on the Browser
toolbar (which bears a big capital T), or by pressing Command-3. You can
add a title with a still image, but iMovie also includes everything you need 
to add basic animated text to your movie.
Most of the controls you can adjust are the same for each animation style.
You can change the the font, the size of the text, and the color of the text.

Sharing Your Finished Classic with Others
To add a title
1. Select an animation thumbnail from the browser pane and drag it to
the desired spot in the Project pane.
2. Click the Show Fonts button to make any changes to the fonts or text
attributes.
3. Click in a text box to type your own line of text.
4. Click the Play button to preview your title.
iMovie displays a preview of the effect in the monitor with the settings
that you choose.
5. Click Done.
The title appears in the Project pane.
Sharing Your Finished Classic with Others
Your movie is complete, you’ve saved it to your hard drive, and now you’re
wondering where to go from here. Click Share on the application menu bar,
and you’ll see that iMovie can unleash your movie upon your unsuspecting
family and friends (and even the entire world) in a number of ways:
Figure 4-6:

silent film.

Sharing Your Finished Classic with Others
324
✦iTunes: Send your movie to your iTunes library as a movie.
✦.Mac Web Gallery: Share your movie with the world at large by posting
it within a Web Gallery on your .Mac Web site. (I provide more .Mac
details to chew on in Book IV, Chapter 4.)
✦Media Browser: Make your iMovie project available within other iLife
‘08 applications, in four different sizes suited to different display
devices.
✦Export Movie: Create a copy of your movie on your hard drive, in one of
four different sizes.
✦Export using QuickTime: Create a QuickTime movie with your project
using the QuickTime encoding engine (allowing greater control over the
export process and the attributes of the finished movie file).
If you use this option, any computer with an installed copy of QuickTime
can display your movies, and you can use QuickTime movies in Keynote
presentations as well.
✦YouTube: Yep, you read right, you can send your iMovie directly to the
YouTube Web site! Can it get more convenient than that? (I think not.)
✦Export to Final Cut XML: If you’d like to transfer your iMovie ‘08 project
to Final Cut Pro, use this option to create a compatible XML file.
When you choose a sharing option, iMovie displays the video quality for the
option, and makes automatic changes to the movie attributes (for example,
choosing Tiny will reduce the finished movie as far as possible in file size,
and the audio is reduced to mono instead of stereo).
Need to take a movie off-line or stop sharing it? You can also remove a 
project from iTunes, your iLife Media Browser, your .Mac Web site or the
YouTube Web site from the Sharing menu as well. Just click the correspon-
ding Remove menu item. (Of course, you can share the project again at 
any time.)
If you’re worried about permanently reducing the quality of your project 
by sharing it in a smaller size, fear not! When you choose a sharing option 
to export your movie, your original project remains on your hard drive,
unchanged, so you can share a better quality version at any time in the
future!
After you adjust any settings specific to the desired sharing option, click
Publish (or Save) to start the ball rolling.

A
number of years ago, I was witness to yet another proud moment 
in Apple history: the arrival of a powerful DVD recorder in an afford-
able computer. The SuperDrive was revolutionary because suddenly folks
could create and view their own professional-quality DVDs.
Today the tradition continues: Apple includes iDVD free with today’s
SuperDrive-equipped Macs as part of iLife. With iDVD 7, you can easily
create beautiful presentations with animation and interactive menus 
that anyone can watch in a standard DVD player or computer DVD 
drive. And that, friends and neighbors, is the quintessential definition 
of cool.
In this chapter, I show you the basics of creating your first home-cooked
DVD movie — you’ll even have fun doing it!
Introducing Your Mac to iDVD
Figure 5-1 shows iDVD in all its glory. The iDVD 7 window was designed by
the same smart people who brought you the iMovie window. You have to
supply your own digital video clips, background audio, and digital photo-
graphs, of course.

Introducing Your Mac to iDVD
326
Take a moment to appreciate iDVD — no secondary windows to fiddle with
or silly palettes strung out everywhere. (Can you tell that I’ve had my fill of
old-style DVD authoring applications?) Allow me to list the highlights of the
iDVD window:
✦Menu display: This section takes up the largest part of the iDVD
window, with good reason. You create your project here. In this case,
Menu refers to your DVD Menu, not the menu at the top of your Mac’s
display.
✦Media pane: You add video, still images, and audio to your project from
here, as well as tweak and fine-tune things. The Media pane actually
comprises four separate panes. To choose a new pane, click one of these
buttons at the bottom of the screen:
• Themes: You apply themes (such as Travel Cards, Wedding White,
and Baby Mobile) to your DVD Menu to give it a certain look and feel.

• Buttons: These options apply to the item currently selected, such as
drop shadows on your text titles or the appearance of your menu
buttons.
• Media: From here, you can add media items, such as video clips and
photos, to your menu.
✦Add button: From this pop-up menu (which sports a dapper plus sign),
you can choose one of three types of buttons to add to a project. The
choices are
• Add Submenu: Choose this item to add a new submenu button to
your DVD Menu. The person using your DVD Menu can click a button
to display a new submenu that can include additional movies or
slideshows. (If that sounds like ancient Greek, hang on. All becomes
clearer later in the chapter in the section “Adding movies.”)
In iDVD 7, a Menu can hold only 12 buttons, so submenus let you
pack more content on your DVD. (Older versions of the application
only allowed 6 buttons, so don’t feel too cheated.) Anyway, each sub-
menu you create can hold another 12 buttons.
• Add Movie: Yep, this is the most popular button in the whole shooting
match. Click this menu item to add a new movie clip to your menu.
• Add Slideshow: If you want to add a slideshow to your DVD — say,
using photos from your hard drive or pictures from your iPhoto
library — click this menu item.
✦Inspector button: Click this button to display the Inspector window for
the current menu or a highlighted object. From this window, you can
change the look of an individual submenu button or an entire menu.
✦Motion: Click this button to start or stop the animation cycle used with
the current iDVD theme. The animation repeats (just as it will on your
finished DVD) until you click the Motion button again.
Need a visual indicator of the length of your menu’s animation cycle?
Click View➪Show Motion Playhead to display the animation playhead,
which moves below the Menu display to indicate where you are in the
animation cycle. Like other playheads in the iLife suite, you can click
and drag the diamond-shaped playhead button to move anywhere in the
animation cycle.
✦DVD Map: Click the Map button to display the organizational chart for
your DVD Menu. Each button and submenu that you add to your top-
level DVD Menu is displayed here, and you can jump directly to a partic-
ular item by double-clicking it. Use this road map to help design the
layout of your DVD Menu system or to get to a particular item quickly.
To return to the Menu display, click the Map button again.

✦Edit Drop Zones: This button allows you to edit the look and contents of
a drop zone on your menu — don’t worry, I’ll explain more about drop
zones in the sidebar titled, “Taking advantage of drop zones” later in this
chapter.
✦Preview: To see how your DVD Menu project looks when burned to a
DVD, click Preview. You get a truly nifty onscreen remote control that
you can use to navigate your DVD Menu, just as if you were watching
your DVD on a standard DVD player. To exit Preview mode, click the
Stop button on the remote control. 
✦Burn: Oh, yeah, you know what this one is for — recording your com-
pleted DVD movie to a blank disc.
That’s the lot! Time to get down to the step-by-step business of making
movies.
Starting a New DVD Project
When you launch iDVD 7 for the first time (or if you close all iDVD windows),
you get the sporty menu shown in Figure 5-2. Take a moment to discover
more about these four choices.
Creating a new project
If you choose Create a New Project, iDVD prompts you to type a name for
your new DVD project and to set a location where the project files should 
be saved. By default, the very reasonable choice is your Documents folder.
You also get to choose whether your project will display in a Standard (full-
screen) aspect ratio of 4:3, or a Widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9. If you’ve
been watching DVD movies for some time, you recognize these two terms.
You’ll probably crave Widescreen format if you have a widescreen TV — go
figure — but both formats will display on both types of televisions.
Click Create, and the iDVD window appears in all its glory.
Opening an existing project
If you’ve used iDVD and had a DVD project open the last time you quit the
application, iDVD automatically loads the DVD project you were working on.
However, you can open any DVD you’ve created by clicking Open an Existing
Project. (To choose a different existing project from the iDVD window, press
Ô+O, or choose File➪Open Recent.)

Automating the whole darn process
If you’re a fan of click-it-and-forget-it (or are in a hurry), you can throw cau-
tion to the wind and allow iDVD to create your latest epic for you! iDVD
offers two automated methods of creating a DVD movie disc. 
Using OneStep DVD
With OneStep, iDVD does most of the work automatically, by using the media
clips and photos that you specify. To allow iDVD to help you create a movie,
click the OneStep DVD button on the top-level menu (refer back to Figure 5-2).
If you’re already opened a project, choose File➪OneStep DVD from the 
application’s menu bar (to import clips directly from your camera) or
OneStep DVD from Movie (to select a clip to import from your hard drive). 
I tell you more about the OneStep DVD feature later in the section “A Word
about Automation.”
Using Magic iDVD
Magic iDVD is the newcomer on the block, and it falls neatly between total
automation (with OneStep DVD) and total manual control. Click the Magic
iDVD button on the top-level menu (as shown in Figure 5-2). If you’re already
opened a project, you can choose File➪Magic iDVD from the menu bar to
choose a theme, drop specific movies and specific photos into filmstrips,
and choose an audio track.
Figure 5-2:
Will that 
be create 
or edit,
manual or
automatic?

Creating a DVD from Scratch
330
Unlike OneStep DVD, you get to preview the finished product. If it’s to your
liking, you can choose to either burn the disc directly or create a full-blown
iDVD project with the results. Sweet.
You’ll find out more about the new Magic iDVD feature later in the section 
“A Word about Automation.”
Creating a DVD from Scratch
Doing things the old-fashioned, creative, and manual way (following the
examples in this section) involves four basic steps:
1. Design the DVD Menu.
Choose a theme and any necessary buttons or links.
2. Add media.
You can drag movie files from iMovie, still images from iPhoto, and
music from iTunes.
3. Tweak.
Adjust and fine-tune your DVD Menu settings.
4. Finish things up.
Preview and burn your DVD, or save it to your hard drive.
Choosing just the right theme
The first step to take when manually designing a new DVD Menu system is 
to add a theme. In the iDVD world, a theme is a preset package that helps
determine the appearance and visual appeal of your DVD Menu, including a
background image, menu animation, an audio track, and a group of settings
for text fonts and button styles.
iDVD helps those of us who are graphically challenged by including a wide
range of professionally designed themes for all sorts of occasions, ranging
from old standbys such as weddings, birthdays, and vacations to more
generic themes with the accent on action, friendship, and technology. To
view the included themes, click the Themes button in the lower-right corner
of the iDVD window (see Figure 5-3).
To choose a theme for your project — or to see what a theme looks like on
your menu — click any thumbnail and watch iDVD update the Menu display.

Book III
Chapter 5
Burn Those DVDs! 
Using iDVD
Creating a DVD from Scratch
331
If you decide while creating your DVD Menu that you need a different theme,
you can change themes at any time. iDVD won’t lose a single button or video
clip that you add to your DVD Menu. You’ll be amazed at how the look and
sound of your DVD Menu completely change with just the click of a theme
thumbnail.
Adding movies
Drop zones and themes are cool, but most folks want to add video to their
DVD. To accomplish this, iDVD uses buttons as links to your video clips. In
fact, some iDVD Movie buttons display a preview of the video they’ll display!
To play the video on a DVD player, you select the Movie button with the
remote control, just like you do for a commercial DVD.
To add a Movie button, drag a QuickTime movie file from the Finder and
drop it onto your DVD Menu display. (Only MPEG-4 QuickTime movies are
supported — MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 movie clips may be rejected or con-
verted.) Alternatively, launch iMovie and drag a clip from the iMovie clip
palette into the iDVD window, or click the Add button and choose Add Movie
from the pop-up menu.

iDVD and iMovie are soul mates, so you can also display the iDVD Media
pane and then click Movies from the pop-up menu. Now you can drag clips
from your Movies folder.
No matter the source of the clip, when you drop it onto your DVD menu,
iDVD adds a Movie button, as you can see in Figure 5-4. Note that some but-
tons appear as text links rather than actual buttons. The appearance of a
Movie button in your DVD menu is determined by the theme you choose.
Taking advantage of drop zones
Most of Apple’s animated themes include spe-
cial bordered areas marked as drop zones.
These locations have nothing to do with skydiv-
ing; rather, a drop zone is a placeholder in the
Menu that can hold a single video clip or photo-
graph. When you drag a video clip or an image
to a drop zone, that clip or picture is added to
the animation in Apple’s theme! Think about that
for a moment; I know I did. You can actually per-
sonalize a Hollywood-quality animated DVD
menu with your own photos and video!
Most of the themes included with iDVD 7
include at least one drop zone, and some are
practically jam-packed with drop zones. For
example, the amazing Forever theme has a
whopping six drop zones! If you think a menu
looks just fine without anything in a drop zone,
however, you don’t have to put anything there.
The words Drop Zone disappear when you pre-
view or burn your DVD. (Empty frames do tend
to look a bit silly in some themes, though.)
To add a video clip or image to a drop zone,
simply drag the clip or photo from a Finder
window and drop it on the desired drop zone.
You can also drag clips or photos from other
sources, including the Movie and iPhoto panes
in iDVD, the iMovie window, or the iPhoto
window. (Remember, Apple is anything but
strict on these matters.) Remember, drop zones
don’t act as links or buttons to other content —
the stuff you add to a menu’s drop zones
appears only as part of the theme’s animation
cycle. You can even drag an iPhoto event or
album to a drop zone, and it will continuously
cycle through the images. Wowsers!
To see all of the drop zones at one time (without
cycling through the animation), click the new
Edit Drop Zones button at the bottom center of
the iDVD window; you’ll see a thumbnail display
of each zone. You can drag items to these
thumbnails, or jump right to one in the animation
by clicking on the thumbnail. To delete the con-
tents of a drop zone, click the thumbnail in the
editor and press the Delete key.
If you’re adding something to a dynamic drop
zone (which disappears and reappears during
the menu animation cycle), click the Motion
button to activate the animation and then click
it again to stop the animation cycle. Now click
and drag the scrubber bar until the desired
drop zone is in view. To delete the contents of a
drop zone, Control-click (or right-click) the drop
zone and choose Clear.

A Movie button doesn’t have to stay where iDVD places it! By default, iDVD
aligns buttons and text objects an invisible grid, but if you don’t want such
order imposed on your creativity, just drag the object where you like to turn
on Free Positioning. (You can also right-click the object and select the Free
Positioning item from the menu that appears.) iDVD 7 even provides cool
new automatic guides that help you align objects when you’re using Free
Positioning! You’ll see them as yellow lines that appear when objects are
aligned along a vertical or horizontal plane.
You can have up to 12 buttons on your iDVD Menu. To add more content
than 12 buttons allow, add a submenu by clicking the Add button and choos-
ing Add Submenu from the pop-up menu. Now you can click the submenu
button to jump to that screen and drag up to another 12 movie files into it.
Keep in mind your target audience while you create your DVD. Standard TV
sets have a different aspect ratio (height to width) and resolution (number 
of pixels on the screen) than a digital video clip, and a standard TV isn’t 
as precise in focusing that image on the tube. If you selected the Standard
aspect ratio when you created the project, you can make sure that your 
DVD content looks great on a standard TV screen by following these steps:

1. Click View on the old-fashioned iDVD menu (the one at the top of 
the screen).
2. Choose the Show TV Safe Area command.
You can also press the convenient Ô+T shortcut. iDVD adds a smaller
rectangle within the iDVD window to mark the screen dimensions of a
standard TV.
If you take care that your menu buttons and (most of) your background
image fit within this smaller rectangle, you’re assured that folks with a stan-
dard television can enjoy your work. To turn off the TV Safe Area rectangle,
press Ô+T again.
If your entire family is blessed with a fleet of HD TVs (or you chose the
Widescreen aspect ratio for this project), leave the Show TV Safe Area option
off. Today’s widescreen displays can handle just about any orientation.
Great, now my audience demands a slideshow
Many Mac owners don’t realize that iDVD can use not only video clips but
also digital photos as content. In fact, you can add a group of images to your
DVD Menu by using Slideshow buttons, which allow the viewer to play back
a series of digital photographs. iDVD handles everything for you, so there’s
no tricky timing to figure out or weird scripts to write. Just click the Add
button at the bottom of the iDVD window and choose Add Slideshow. iDVD
places a Slideshow button on your DVD Menu.
After the Slideshow button is on tap, add the content — in this case, by
choosing the images that iDVD adds to your DVD Menu. Follow these steps
to select your slideshow images:
1. Double-click the Slideshow Menu button — the one you just added to
the menu — to open the Slideshow display (see Figure 5-5).
2. Click the Media button (bottom right of the screen).
3. Click the Photos button (top right of the screen) to display your iPhoto
library and photo albums.
4. Drag your favorite image thumbnails from the Photos list and drop
them into the My Slideshow window.
You can also drag images straight from a Finder window or the iPhoto
window itself. (Those Apple folks are sooooo predictable.)

5. Drag around the photos in the My Slideshow window to set their
order of appearance in your slideshow.
6. To add audio to these pictures, drag your favorite audio file from the
Finder and drop it in the Audio well in the My Slideshow window.
The Audio well is the box bearing the speaker icon, next to the volume
control below the My Slideshow window.
Alternatively, click the Audio button to select an audio track from your
iTunes library, iTunes playlists, or GarageBand creations.
7. Click the Return button to return to your DVD Menu.
If you’re using a menu with animated buttons that display an image (rather
than text buttons), you can choose which image you want to appear on the
Slideshow button. Click the Slideshow button that you added and see the
slider that appears above the Slideshow button. Drag this slider to scroll
through the images you added. When you find the image that you want to
use for the Slideshow button in the DVD Menu, click the Slideshow button
again to save your changes.

Now for the music . . . .
Most of the Apple-supplied themes already have their own background
music for your menu, so you might not even need to add music to your DVD
Menu. However, if you want to change the existing background music (or if
your menu currently doesn’t have any music), adding your own audio to the
current menu is child’s play!
1. Click the Media button.
2. Click the Audio button to reveal the musical Shangri-La, as shown in
Figure 5-6.
3. Drag an audio file from the iTunes playlist or GarageBand folder dis-
play and drop it on the menu background.
iDVD 7 accepts every sound format that you can use for importing
encoding in iTunes: AIFF, MP3, AAC, Apple Lossless, and WAV audio files.
4. Click the Motion button (labeled in Figure 5-1) to watch your DVD
Menu animation cycle set to the new background audio.
5. Click the Motion button again to stop the animation and return to 
serious work.
A word on image dimensions
For best playback results on a standard TV,
make sure that your background image has the
same dimensions as standard digital video —
640 x 480 pixels. If the dimensions of your image
don’t match the dimensions of digital video,
iDVD will stretch or shrink the image to fit,
which might have undesirable effects. When
your image is stretched and skewed to fit the
DVD Menu, Aunt Harriet might end up looking
like Shrek.
You can use QuickTime player or iPhoto to
change the dimensions of your background
image for import into iDVD. For example, you
can use the iPhoto crop feature to alter the
overall shape of the image and then resize it
within iPhoto. Use the Size setting when you
export the image from iPhoto and then save the
file in the Pictures folder located in your Home
folder so that you can find it easily later. (For
more on working in iPhoto, see Book III,
Chapter 3.)
If you enjoy a cutting-edge widescreen (16:9) or
HD (high-definition) TV display, you naturally
might not have the same problem. And because
iDVD 7 supports HD video and 16:9 video with a
number of widescreen themes, be prepared to
kiss the phrases pan-and-scan and full-screen
goodbye and forget about the Show TV Safe
Area feature. If your completed DVD projects
are purely for your own enjoyment, that’s a
great idea. However, don’t forget that if you dis-
tribute your discs to others with old-fashioned
TVs dating back to the archaic ’80s and ’90s,
they might not be pleased with what they see!

Giving Your DVD the Personal Touch
You can easily make changes to the default settings provided with the theme
you chose. iDVD offers all sorts of controls that allow you to change the
appearance and behavior of buttons, text, and the presentation of your con-
tent. In this section, I show you how to cast out iDVD’s (perfectly good)
defaults and then tweak things to perfection.
Using Uncle Morty for your DVD Menu background
Hey, Uncle Morty might not be a supermodel, but he has birthdays and
anniversaries, and iDVD is more than happy to accommodate you in docu-
menting those milestones! Follow these steps to change the background of
your DVD Menu:
1. Click the Inspector button.
2. Get an image using one of the following methods:
• Drag an image from the Finder and drop it into the Background well.
• Drag the image directly into the Menu display.

• To use an image from your iPhoto library, click the Media button and
choose Photos, and then drag the desired image into the Menu display.
• iDVD updates the DVD menu to reflect your new background choice.
Adding your own titles
The one tweak you’ll probably have to perform in every iDVD project is
changing titles. Unfortunately, the default labels provided by iDVD are pretty
lame, and they appear in two important places:
✦Menu title: Your large main title usually appears at the top of the 
DVD Menu.
✦Button captions: Each Submenu, Movie, and Slideshow button that you
add to your menu has its own title.
To change the text in your Menu title or the titles below your buttons, follow
these steps:
1. Select the text by clicking it.
2. Click it again to edit it.
A rectangle with a cursor appears to indicate that you can now edit 
the text.
3. Type the new text and press Return to save the change.
Changing buttons like a highly paid professional
Customizing Movie buttons? You can do it with aplomb! Follow these steps:
1. Click Buttons.
2. Click any Movie button from the DVD Menu to select it.
A slider appears above the button, which you can drag to set the thumb-
nail picture for that button in your DVD Menu. (Naturally, this is only for
animated buttons, not text buttons.)
Enable the Movie check box to animate the button.
3. To create a Movie button with a still image, drag a picture from a
Finder window or the Media pane and drop it on top of the button.
4. To adjust the properties for the button, click the Inspector button.
Table 5-1 describes the button properties — note that some properties won’t
appear for text buttons.

Earlier in this chapter, you found out how to use a different image for your
background, but what about using an animated background? You can use
any QuickTime movie from your iMovie library to animate your DVD Menu
background! Didn’t I tell you that this iDVD thing was huge?
Keep in mind that your background movie should be a short clip; 20–30 sec-
onds is optimal. A clip with a fade-in at the beginning and a fade-out at the
end is the best choice because iDVD loops your background clip continu-
ously, and your animated background flows seamlessly behind your menu.
I’m not talking drop zones here. (See the sidebar “Taking advantage of drop
zones.”) You can add a movie to a drop zone, of course, but by using a movie
clip as a background, you’re replacing the entire animation sequence rather
than just a single area of the background.
Follow these steps to add a new animated background:
1. Click your old friend, the Inspector button.
Make sure that no individual objects are highlighted, so that the
Inspector window displays the Menu properties instead.
2. Drag a movie from the Finder and drop it into the Background well.
You can click the Movies button in the Media pane to instantly display
your iMovie collection.
3. Click the Motion button in the iDVD window to try out your new 
background.
4. Click the Motion button again to stop the animation cycle.

Previewing Your Masterpiece

Previewing Your Masterpiece
Figure 5-7 captures the elusive Preview remote control — truly an awesome
sight. When you click Preview, the Media pane disappears, and your DVD
Menu appears exactly as it will on the finished DVD.
Ah, but appearances aren’t everything: You can also use your DVD Menu!
Click the buttons on the remote control to simulate the remote on your DVD
player, or think outside the box and click a menu button directly with your
mouse pointer. iDVD presents the video clip, runs the slideshow, or jumps 
to a submenu, just as it will with the completed disc.
This is a great time to test-drive a project before you burn it to disc. To make
sure you don’t waste a blank DVD, make certain that everything you expect
to happen actually happens. Nothing worse than discovering that Aunt
Edna’s slideshow from her Hong Kong trip actually displays your family’s
summer trip to the zoo (whoops). If you made a mistake or something 
needs tweaking, click the Preview button again, and you’re back to the 
iDVD window proper, where you can edit or fine-tune your project.

A Word about Automation
341
iDVD 7 allows you to save your project as a standard Mac OS X disc image
rather than as a simple project file (or a physical DVD) — a good idea for
those Macs without a SuperDrive on board because you can use Apple’s Disk
Utility to open and mount the disc image as if it were a burned disc. If you
move the disc image to another Mac with a SuperDrive, you can use Disk
Utility to burn it on that machine. To save an iDVD project as a disc image,
choose File➪Save as Disc Image (or press Ô+Shift+R). 
Interested in tweaking settings across your entire project? Perhaps you’d 
like to reduce the time it takes to create and edit your DVD, or you’d like to
switch video modes from NTSC to PAL for a DVD that’s to be sent overseas. 
If you’d like to view or change the overall settings for your entire DVD, click
Project➪Project Info to display the Project Info dialog. Heck, you can even
switch aspect ratios, or change the project name... thanks, Apple!
A Word about Automation
At the beginning of the chapter, I mention the easy way to produce an iDVD
disc or project, using either OneStep DVD (for complete automation) or
Magic iDVD (for partial automation). In this section, I provide you with the
details.
One-click paradise with OneStep DVD
If you’re in a hurry to create a DVD from clips on your DV camcorder and
you don’t mind losing your creative input, OneStep DVD is just the ticket. In
short, iDVD 7 allows you to plug in your DV camcorder, answer a question or
two, and then sit back while the application does all the work. iDVD imports
the DV clips, creates a basic menu design, and burns the disc automatically!
Using OneStep DVD will appeal to any laptop owner with a SuperDrive. Why
not produce a DVD right after a wedding or birthday that you can give as a
gift? Photographers who cover those same special events might consider
selling a DVD made with OneStep DVD. If you happen to capture something
incredibly unique — such as a UFO landing or an honest politician — you
can use OneStep DVD to create an instant backup of the clips on your DV
camcorder. You could even keep your friends and family up-to-date with the
progress of your vacation by sending them a daily DVD of your exploits! (You
gotta admit, even Grandma would consider that eminently sassy!)
Follow these steps to start the OneStep DVD process:

A Word about Automation
342
1. Click the OneStep DVD button on the iDVD 7 top-level menu (refer to
Figure 5-2).
Alternately, choose File➪OneStep DVD. 
iDVD displays the dialog shown in Figure 5-8.
If you want to use OneStep DVD with an existing movie on your Mac’s
hard drive, choose File➪OneStep DVD from Movie instead. iDVD
prompts you for the video clip to use.
2. Following the prompts, connect the FireWire cable from your DV cam-
corder; then turn on the camcorder and set it to VCR mode.
3. Click OK.
4. Load a blank DVD.
Exercising control with Magic iDVD
Got a little extra time? For those who prefer to make just a few choices and
let iDVD do the rest, the new Magic iDVD feature just plain rocks! However,
you can’t import clips directly from your DV camcorder like you can with
OneStep DVD — instead, you select one of the following:
✦An iDVD theme
✦Video clips you’ve already created with iMovie or dragged from 
the Finder
✦Photos from your iPhoto library or dragged from the Finder
✦Audio from your iTunes playlist or dragged from the Finder
Follow these steps to start the OneStep DVD process:
1. Click the Magic iDVD button on the iDVD 7 top-level menu (refer to
Figure 5-2).
iDVD displays the window you see in Figure 5-9.
2. Click in the DVD Title box and type a name for your disc (or project).

3. Click to select a theme from the Theme strip.
4. Click the Movies button and drag the desired clips into the Drop

5. To add a slideshow, click the Photos button and drag the desired
photos into the Drop Photos Here strip.
6. To add audio for your slideshow, click the Audio button and drag the
desired song into the Drop Photos Here strip (a speaker icon appears
in the first cell of the strip to indicate that you’ve added a soundtrack).
7. Click Preview to see a preview of the finished project, complete with
remote control. To exit Preview mode, click Exit.
8. To open the project in its current form in the main iDVD window,
click Create Project.
9. To record your completed project directly to DVD, load a blank DVD
and click Burn.
To return to the iDVD main window at any time, just click the Close button
on the Magic iDVD window.

Recording a Finished Project to a Shiny Disc

Recording a Finished Project to a Shiny Disc
When you’re ready to record your next Oscar-winning documentary on
family behaviors during vacation, just follow these simple words.
1. Click the Burn button at the bottom of the iDVD window.
I have to admit, the Burn button that appears has to be my favorite
single control in all my 20+ years of computing! It looks powerful, it looks
sexy . . . it wants to burn. (Sorry about that.)
2. After iDVD asks you to insert a blank DVD-R into the SuperDrive, load
a blank DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, or DVD+RW (depending on the
media your Mac can handle).
Your SuperDrive might be able to burn and read a DVD+R, DVD-RW, or
DVD+RW, but what about your DVD player? Keep in mind that only DVD-
Rs are likely to work in older DVD players. The latest generation of DVD
players are likely DVD+R compatible as well, but I’ve seen only a handful
of DVD players that can handle rewriteable media at the time of this
writing. Therefore, remember the destination for the discs you burn and
choose your media accordingly.
After a short pause, iDVD begins burning the DVD. The application
keeps you updated with a progress bar.
Hey, while you’re waiting, how about a timely book recommendation? If you
want to discover how to burn all sorts of data, audio, and exotic CD and 
DVD formats, I can heartily recommend another of my books, CD & DVD
Recording For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley). It’s a comprehensive manual 
for recording on the Mac. You’ll find coverage of the popular Toast Titanium
recording application from Roxio, too.
When the disc is finished, you’re ready to load it into your favorite local DVD
player, or you can load it back into your Mac and enjoy your work using
Apple’s DVD Player.
Either way, it’s all good!

W
hen I was a kid, I always thought that real rock stars trashed their
instruments after a hard night’s worth of jamming — you know, like
The Who, Led Zeppelin, KISS, and the Rolling Stones. Guitars got set on fire,
or pounded into the stage, or thrown into the crowd like beads during a
Mardi Gras parade.
I can make my own music now, but you’ll never see me trash my instrument
because I compose music on my Mac with GarageBand, Apple’s latest addi-
tion to the iLife application suite. You can solo on all sorts of instruments,
and even add horns, drums, and a funky bass line for backup . . . all with
absolutely no musical experience (and, in my case, very little talent to
boot)!
Oh, and did I mention that GarageBand ‘08 also produces podcasts? That’s
right, you can record your voice and easily create your own show, and then
share it with others from your iWeb site! Heck, add photos if you like. You’ll
be the talk of your family and friends and maybe even your Mac user group.
This chapter explains everything you need to know to create your first song
(or your first podcast). I also show you how to import your hit record into
iTunes so you can listen to it on your iPod with a big, silly grin on your face
(like I do) or add it to your next iMovie or iDVD project as a royalty-free
soundtrack.

Shaking Hands with Your Band
346
Shaking Hands with Your Band
As you can see in Figure 6-1, the GarageBand window isn’t complex at all,
and that’s good design. In this section, I list the most important controls so
you know your Play button from your Loop Browser button.
Your music-making machine includes
✦Track list: In GarageBand, a track is a discrete instrument that you set
up to play one part of your song. For example, a track in a classical piece
for string quartet would have four tracks — one each for violin, viola,
cello, and bass. This list contains all the tracks in your song arranged so
that you can easily see and modify them, like the rows in a spreadsheet.
A track begins in the list, stretching out to the right all the way to the
end of the song. As you can see in the upper left of Figure 6-1, I already
have one track defined — a Grand Piano.
If you’re creating a podcast, a Podcast artwork track like the one you see
at the very top of the list in Figure 6-1 can also appear.
✦Timeline: This scrolling area holds the loops (see the following bullet)
that you add or record, allowing you to move and edit them easily. When 
a song plays, the Timeline scrolls to give you a visual look at your music.
(Bear with me; you’ll understand that cryptic statement in a page or two.)
✦Loop: This is a prerecorded clip of an instrument being played in a spe-
cific style and tempo. Loops are the building blocks of your song. You
can drag loops from the loop browser to a track and literally build a bass
line or a guitar solo. (It’s a little like adding video clips to the Timeline in
iMovie to build a film.)
✦Playhead: This vertical line is a moving indicator that shows you the
current position in your song while it scrolls by in the Timeline. You can
drag the playhead to a new location at any time. The playhead also acts
like the insertion cursor in a word processing application: If you insert a
section of a song or a loop from the clipboard, it appears at the current
location of the playhead. (More on copying and inserting loops later, so
don’t panic.)
✦Create a New Track button: Click this button to add a new track to your
song.
✦Track Info button: If you need to display the instrument used in a track,
click the track to select it and then click this button. You can also con-
trol settings, such as Echo and Reverb, from the dialog that’s displayed.
✦View/Hide Loop Browser button: Click the button with the striking eye
icon to display the Loop Browser at the bottom of the window; click it
again to close it. You can see more tracks at a time without scrolling by
closing the Loop Browser.

✦View/Hide Media Browser button: Click this button (which bears icons 
of a filmstrip, slide, and musical note) to display the media browser at 
the right side of the window; click it again to close it. By closing the media
browser, you’ll see more of your tracks. If you’re already familiar with
iDVD or iMovie, you recognize this pane in the GarageBand window — it
allows you to add media (in this case, still images or video clips) to your
GarageBand project for use in a podcast.
✦Return to Beginning button: Clicking this button immediately moves
the playhead back to the beginning of the Timeline.

✦Play button: Hey, old friend! At last, a control that you’ve probably used
countless times before — and it works just like the same control on your
audio CD player. Click Play, and GarageBand begins playing your entire
song. Notice that the Play button turns blue. To stop the music, click
Play again; the button loses that sexy blue sheen, and the playhead
stops immediately. (If playback is paused, it begins again at the playhead
position when you click Play.)
✦Time/Tempo display: This cool-looking LCD display shows you the cur-
rent playhead position in seconds. You can also click the time/tempo
indicator (the blue LED numeric display at the bottom of the window) 
to change the tempo (or speed) of your song.
GarageBand ‘08 expands the abilities of the default Time/Tempo 
display — click the icon at the left of the display to choose other 
modes, such as 
• Time (to show a more precise absolute time display) 
• Project (to show the key, tempo and signature for the song).
✦Volume slider: Here’s another familiar face. Just drag the slider to raise
or lower the volume.
Of course, more controls are scattered around the GarageBand window, but
these are the main controls used to compose a song . . . which is the next stop!
Composing and Podcasting Made Easy
In this section, I cover the basics of composition in GarageBand, working
from the very beginning. Follow along with this running example:
1. Press Ô+N.
GarageBand displays the Project select dialog.
2. Click Create New Music Project to create a new song.
GarageBand displays the New Project dialog, as shown in Figure 6-2.
3. Type a name for your new song and then drag the Tempo slider to
select the beats per minute (bpm).
A GarageBand song can have only one tempo (or speed) throughout,
expressed as beats per minute.
4. If you want to adjust the settings for your song, you can select the
• Time signature (the Time box)
• Key (the Key box)

If you’re new to music theory (the rules/syntax by which music is cre-
ated and written), just use the defaults. Most of the toe-tappin’ tunes
that you and I are familiar with fit right in with these settings.
5. Click the Create button.
You see the window shown in Figure 6-1. (The Ballad Piano 01 section 
in the middle of Figure 6-1 — which I show you how to add in the next
section — is an example of a typical loop.)
Adding tracks
Although I’m not a musician, I am a music lover, and I know that many classi-
cal composers approached a new work in the same way you approach a new
song in GarageBand: by envisioning the instruments that you want to hear. (I
imagine Mozart and Beethoven would’ve been thrilled to use GarageBand,
but I think they did a decent job with pen and paper too.)
If you’ve followed along to this point, you’ve noticed two problems with your
GarageBand window:
✦The tiny keyboard in the middle of your GarageBand window. You can
record the contents of a software instrument track by “playing” the key-
board, clicking the keys with your mouse. (As you might imagine, this
isn’t the best solution.) If you’re a musician, the best method of record-
ing your own notes is with a MIDI instrument, which I discuss later in the
chapter. For now, you can banish the keyboard window by clicking the
window’s Close button — to display it again at any time, press
Command-K.
Figure 6-2:

Even if you’re not interested in the “point-and-click” keyboard,
GarageBand now offers a musical typing keyboard, where you press the
keys on your keyboard to simulate the keys on a musical keyboard. (Hey,
if you don’t have a MIDI instrument, at least it’s better than nothing.) To
display the musical typing keyboard window, press Shift-Command-K.
✦The example song has only one track. If you want to write the next clas-
sical masterpiece for Grand Piano (the default track when you create a
new song in GarageBand), that’s fine. Otherwise, on the GarageBand
menu bar, choose Track➪Delete Track to start with a clean slate.
These are the four kinds of tracks you can use in GarageBand ‘08:
✦Software instrument tracks: These tracks aren’t audio recordings.
Rather, they’re mathematically precise algorithms that your Mac renders
(or builds) to fit your needs. If you have a MIDI instrument connected to
your Mac, you can create your own software instrument tracks — more
on MIDI instruments later in this chapter.
In this chapter, I focus on software instrument tracks, which are the 
easiest for a non-musician to use.
✦Real instrument tracks: A real instrument track is an actual audio
recording, such as your voice or a physical instrument without a MIDI
connection. (Think microphone.)
✦Podcast artwork track: You get only one of these — they hold photos
that will appear on a video iPod (or a window on your iWeb site) when
your podcast is playing.
✦Video tracks: The video sound track appears if you’re scoring (adding
music) to an iMovie movie. Along with the video sound track, you get a
cool companion video track that shows the clips in your movie. (More
on this in the sidebar “Look, I’m John Williams!,” later in this chapter.)
Time to add a software instrument track of your very own. Follow these steps:
1. Click the Create a New Track button (which carries a plus sign),
labeled in Figure 6-1.
GarageBand displays the New Track dialog.
2. Click the Software Instrument Track radio button and then click Create.
See all those great instruments in the Track Info pane on the right?
3. Choose the general instrument category by clicking it.
I chose Drum Kits.

4. From the right column, choose your specific style of weapon, such as
Jazz Kit for a jazzy sound.
Figure 6-3 illustrates the new track that appears in your list when you
follow these steps.
If you’re creating a podcast and you want to add a series of still images 
that will appear on a video iPod’s screen (or on your iWeb page), follow
these steps:
1. Click the View Media Browser button (labeled in Figure 6-1).
2. Click the Photos button.
GarageBand displays all of the photos in your iPhoto library and film rolls.
3. Drag an image from your iPhoto library in the media browser to the
Track list.
The Podcast track appears at the top of the Track list, and you can add
and move images in the list at any time, just like the loops that you add
to your instrument tracks. (More on adding and rearranging the con-
tents of a track later in this section.)

Choosing loops
When you have a new, empty track, you can add something that you can
hear. You do that by adding loops to your track from the loop browser —
Apple provides you with thousands of loops to choose from — and photos
from your media browser. Click the Loop Browser button (which bears the
all-seeing eye) to display your collection, as shown in Figure 6-4.
If your browser looks different from what you see in Figure 6-4, that’s
because of the view mode you’re using, just like the different view modes
available for a Finder window. The three-icon button in the lower-left corner
of the loop browser toggles the browser display between column, musical
button, and podcast sounds view. Click the middle of the three buttons to
switch to button mode.

Looking for just the right loop
The track in this running example uses a jazz drum kit, but we haven’t added
a loop yet. (Refer to Figure 6-3.) Follow these steps to search through your
loop library for just the right rhythm:
1. Click the button that corresponds to the instrument you’re using.
In our example, this is the Kits button in the loop browser. Click it, and 
a list of different beats appears in the pane to the right of the browser
window. (Check out Figure 6-4 for a sneak peek.)
2. Click one of the loops with a green musical note icon.
Go ahead, this is where things get fun! GarageBand begins playing the
loop nonstop, allowing you to get a feel for how that particular loop
sounds.
Because I’m using only software instruments in this track (and through-
out this chapter), you should choose only software instrument loops,
which are identified with a green musical note icon.
3. Click another entry in the list, and the application switches immedi-
ately to that loop.
Now you’re beginning to understand why GarageBand is so cool for both
musicians and the note-impaired. It’s like having your own band, with
members that never get tired and play whatever you want while you’re
composing. (Mozart would’ve loved this.)
If you want to search for a particular instrument, click in the Search box
(labeled in Figure 6-4) and type the text you want to match. GarageBand
returns the search results in the list.
4. Scroll down the list and continue to sample the different loops until
you find one that fits like a glove.
For this reporter, it’s Lounge Jazz Drums 01.
5. Drag the entry to your Jazz Kit track and drop it at the very beginning
of the Timeline (as indicated by the playhead).
Your window will look like Figure 6-5.
If you want that same beat throughout the song, you don’t need to add any
more loops to that track (more on extending that beat in the next section).
However, if you want the drum’s beat to change later in the song, you add 
a second loop after the first one in the same track. For now, leave this track
as is.
Whoops! Did you do something that you regret? Don’t forget that you can
undo most actions in GarageBand by pressing the old standby Ô+Z immedi-
ately afterward.

Second verse, same as the first
When you compose, you can add additional tracks for each instrument that
you want in your song:
✦Each track can have more than one loop.
✦Loops don’t have to start at the beginning; you can drop a loop any-
where in the Timeline.
For example, in Figure 6-6, you can see that my drum kit kicks in first, but my
bass line doesn’t begin until some time later (for a funkier opening).
You put loops on separate tracks so they can play simultaneously on differ-
ent instruments. If all your loops in a song are added on the same track, you
hear only one loop at any one time, and all the loops use the same software
instrument. By creating multiple tracks, you give yourself the elbow room to
bring in the entire band at the same time. It’s uber-convenient to compose
your song when you can see each instrument’s loops and where they fall in
the song.
Click the Reset button in the loop browser to choose another instrument or
genre category.
Look, I’m John Williams!
You too can be a famous composer of sound-
tracks . . . well, perhaps not quite as famous as
Mr. Williams, but even he had to start some-
where. To add a GarageBand score to an
iMovie , click the Track menu and then click
Show Movie Track to display the. Click the
Share button, and GarageBand automatically
displays the Movie track. Choose a movie to
score from the familiar confines of the Media
Browser, and drag it to the Movie Track.
At this point, you add and modify instrument
tracks and loops just like you would any other
GarageBand project. The existing sound for the
iMovie project appears in the Movie Sound
track. A Video Preview pane appears on top of
the Track Info pane on the right side of the
GarageBand window — when you click the
Play button, the video is shown as well, so that
you can check your work and tweak settings
(as described later in the chapter).
After you’ve finished your composing, you can
click Share on the menu bar and choose to
export your work to iDVD, as a QuickTime movie
directly to your hard drive, or to iTunes as a
movie. Note that you can’t return to iMovie with
your project, so scoring should be a final step
in the production of your movie.

Resizing, repeating, and moving loops
If you haven’t already tried listening to your entire song, try it now. You can
click Play at any time without wreaking havoc on your carefully created
tracks. Sounds pretty good, doesn’t it?
But wait: I bet the song stopped after about five seconds, right? (You can
watch the passing seconds using either the Time/Tempo display or the
second rule that appears at the very top of the Timeline.) I’m sure that you
want your song to last more than five seconds! After the playhead moves
past the end of the last loop, your song is over. Click Play again to pause the
playback; then click the Return to Beginning button (labeled in Figure 6-1) to
move the playhead back to the beginning of the song.
The music stops so soon because your loops are only so long. Most are five
seconds in length, and others are even shorter. To keep the groove going,
you have to do one of three things:
✦Resize the loop. Hover your mouse cursor over either the left or right
edge of most loops, and an interesting thing happens: Your cursor
changes to a vertical line with an arrow pointing away from the loop.
That’s your cue to click and drag — and as you drag, most loops expand
to fill the space you’re making, repeating the beats in perfect time. By
resizing a loop, you can literally drag the loop’s edge as long as you like.
✦Repeat the loop. Depending on the loop that you chose, you might find
that resizing it won’t repeat the measure. Instead, the new part of the
loop is simply dead air. In fact, the length of many loops is limited to
anywhere from 1 to 5 seconds. However, if you move your cursor over
the side of a loop that you want to extend, it turns into a vertical line
with a circular arrow, which tells you that you can click and repeat the
loop. GarageBand actually adds multiple copies of the same loop auto-
matically, for as far as you drag the loop. In Figure 6-7, I’ve repeated the
bass loop that you saw in Figure 6-6.
✦Add a new loop. You can switch to a different loop to change the flow 
of the music. Naturally, the instrument stays the same, but there’s no
reason why you can’t use a horn riff loop in your violin track (as long 
as it sounds good played by a violin)! To GarageBand, a software instru-
ment track is compatible with any software instrument loop that you
add from the loop browser as long as that loop is marked with our old
friend, the green musical note.
You can also use the familiar cut (Ô+X), copy (Ô+C), and paste (Ô+V) edit-
ing keys to cut, copy, and paste loops from place to place — both on the
Timeline and from track to track. And you can click a loop and drag it any-
where. After all, you’re working under Mac OS X.

Each track can be adjusted so that you can listen to the interplay between
two or more tracks or hear how your song sounds without a specific track:
✦Click the tiny speaker button under the track name in the list, and the
button turns blue to indicate that the track is muted. To turn off the
mute, click the speaker icon again.
✦You can change the volume or balance of each individual track by using
the mixer that appears next to the track name. This comes in handy if
you want an instrument to sound louder or confine that instrument to
the left or right speaker.
A track doesn’t have to be filled for every second with one loop or another.
As you can see in Figure 6-8, my first big hit — I call it Turbo Techno — has a
number of repeating loops with empty space between them as different
instruments perform solo. Not bad for an air guitarist who can barely whis-
tle. Listen for it soon at a rave near you!

Using the Arrange track
GarageBand ‘08 adds another method you can use to monkey with your
music: the Arrange track can be used to define specific sections of a song,
allowing you to reorganize things by selecting, moving and copying entire
sections. For example, you’re probably familiar with the chorus (or refrain)
of a song, and how often it appears during the course of the tune — with the
Arrange track, you can reposition the entire chorus within your song, carry-
ing all of the loops and settings within the chorus along with it! If you need
another chorus, just copy that arrangement. 
To use the Arrange track, display it by clicking Track➪Show Arrange Track —
the Arrange track appears as a thin strip at the top of the track list. Click the
Add Region button in the Arrange track (which carries a plus sign), and you’ll
see a new untitled region appear (as shown in Figure 6-9). You can drag the
right side of the Arrange region to resize it, or drag it to move it anywhere in
the song.
Who wants an arrangement full of regions named “untitled”? To rename an
Arrangement region, click the word “untitled” to select it (the Arrange track
turns blue), and then click the title again to display a text box. Type a new
name for the region and press Return.

Now, here’s where arrangement regions get cool:
✦To move an entire arrangement region, click on the region’s title in the
Arrange track and then drag it anywhere you like in the song.
✦To copy an arrangement region, hold down the Option key and drag the
desired region’s title to the spot where you want the copy to appear.
✦To delete an arrangement region, select it and press Command-Option-
Delete.
✦To replace the contents of an arrangement region with those of another
arrangement region, hold down the Command key and drag the desired
region’s title on top of the offending region’s title.
✦To switch two arrangement regions in your song — swapping the con-
tents completely — drag one of the arrangement region titles on top of
the other and release the mouse button.
Tweaking the settings for a track
You don’t think that John Mayer or U2 just “play and walk away,” do you? 
No, they spend hours after the recording session is over, tweaking their
music in the studio and on the mixing board until every note sounds just 
like it should. You can adjust the settings for a track, too. The tweaks that
Figure 6-9:

you can perform include adding effects (pull a Hendrix and add echo and
reverb to your electric guitar track) and kicking in an equalizer (for fine-
tuning the sound of your background horns).
To make adjustments to a track, follow these steps:
1. Click the desired track in the track list to select it.
2. Click the Track Info button (labeled in Figure 6-1).
3. Click the Details triangle at the bottom to expand the pane and show
the settings shown in Figure 6-10.
4. Select the check box of each effect you want to enable.
Each of the effects has a modifier setting. For example, you can adjust
the amount of echo to add by dragging its slider.
GarageBand ‘08 provides a new Visual Equalizer window you can use 
to create a custom equalizer setting for each track. You can display the
Visual EQ window by clicking on the Edit button at the far right of the
Visual EQ controls in the expanded Track Info pane. To change the Bass,
Low Mid, High Mid or Treble setting for a track, click and drag the equal-
izer waveform in the desired direction. And yep, you can do this while
your song is playing, so you can use both your eyes and ears to define
the perfect settings!

Join in and jam . . . or talk!
As I mention elsewhere in this chapter,
GarageBand is even more fun if you happen to
play an instrument! (And yes, I’m envious, no
matter how much I enjoy the techno and jazz
music that I create. After all, take away my
Mac, and I’m back to playing the kazoo.)
Most musicians use MIDI instruments to play
music on the computer. That pleasant-sounding
acronym stands for Musical Instrument Digital
Interface. A wide variety of MIDI instruments
are available these days, from traditional MIDI
keyboards to more exotic fun, such as MIDI
saxophones. For example, Apple sells a 49-key
MIDI keyboard from M-Audio for around 
$100 — it uses a USB connection to your Mac.
Most MIDI instruments on the market today use
a USB connection. If you have an older instru-
ment with traditional MIDI ports — they’re
round, so you’ll never confuse them with a USB
connector — you need a USB-to-MIDI con-
verter. You can find this type of converter on the
Apple Web site for around $50. (If you’re
recording your voice for a podcast, things are
easier because you can use your Mac’s built-
in microphone.)
After your instrument is connected, you can
record tracks using any software instrument.
Create a new software instrument track as I
demonstrate in this chapter, select it, and then
play a few notes. Suddenly you’re playing the
instrument you chose! (If nothing happens,
check the MIDI status light — which appears
in the time display — to see whether it blinks
with each note you play. If not, check the instal-
lation of your MIDI connection and make sure
you’ve loaded any required drivers.)
Drag the playhead to a beat or two before the
spot in the Timeline where you want your
recording to start. This gives you time to match
the beat. Then click the big red Record button
and start jamming or speaking! When you’re
finished, click the Play button to stop recording.

To create a new song automatically, follow these steps:
1. Press Command-N to start a new project.
If you’re currently working on a song, GarageBand will prompt you to
save it before closing the window.
2. Click the Magic GarageBand button on the Project Select dialog box.
You’ll see an imposing curtain, with a button for each song genre.
3. Click the desired genre button.
4. To hear the entire song with the default instruments, click Entire Song

Alternately, to hear a short sample of the song click Snippet and press
the Play button.
5. Click Audition to switch instruments or use the default musical
arrangement.
The curtains open (as shown in Figure 6-11), and you see each individual
instrument on stage. To choose a different musical style for an instru-
ment (or a different variation of the instrument), click on it, then select
the desired sound from the menu below the stage.
Click on My Instrument (the empty space in the middle of the stage)

6. Once the song fits like a glove, click Create Project to open the song as
a project in GarageBand.
Now you can edit and tweak the song to your heart’s delight like any other
GarageBand project, adding other software or real instrument tracks as 
necessary.
Sharing Your Songs and Podcasts
After you finish your song, you can play it whenever you like through
GarageBand. But then again, that isn’t really what you want, is it? You want
to share your music with others with an audio CD or download it to your
iPod so that you can enjoy it yourself while walking through the mall!
iTunes to the rescue! Just like the other iLife applications that I cover in this
book, GarageBand can share the music you make through the digital hub
that is your Mac.
Creating MP3 and AAC files
You can create an MP3 or AAC file from your song or podcast project in just
a few simple steps:
1. Open the song that you want to share.
2. Choose Share➪Send Song to iTunes.
GarageBand displays the settings you see in Figure 6-12.
3. Click in each of the four text boxes to type the playlist, artist name,
composer name, and album name for the tracks you create.
You can leave the defaults as-is, if you prefer. Each track that you export
is named after the song’s name in GarageBand.
4. Click the Compress Using pop-up menu and choose the encoder
GarageBand should use to compress your song file.
The default is AAC, but you can also choose MP3 encoding for greater
compatibility.
5. Click the Audio Settings pop-up menu to select the proper audio qual-
ity for the finished file.
The higher quality, the larger the file — GarageBand displays the approx-
imate file size and finished file information in the description box.
6. Click Share.

If you’ve prepared a new podcast episode in GarageBand, you can send it
automatically to iWeb or iTunes by following these steps:
1. Open the podcast that you want to export to iWeb.
Make sure that the Podcast track is displayed — if necessary, click
Track➪Show Podcast Track to display it.
2. Choose Share➪Send Podcast to iWeb (or Share➪Send Podcast to

keep telling everyone who’ll listen: The Web is simple. Or at least it
should be.
Kids in preschool these days know how to use a browser. Millions of people
contribute to MySpace pages, help to create the dynamic reference wonder
that is Wikipedia, and correspond effortlessly through Web-based e-mail. Yet
there’s one untamed wilderness that many Mac owners haven’t explored —
or even set foot in! That’s the jungle of HTML, the language used to create
Web pages. HTML is complex, and it’s not particularly fun either. Have you
thrown up your hands and declared, “I guess I’ll never get my own Web site
on the Internet?”
Forget your Web site envy, fellow Mac enthusiast! With iWeb, the most recent
addition to the iLife suite, Apple has provided a guide through that untamed
wilderness . . . and suddenly it’s as easy and fun to create a Web site as it is to
make a movie or write a song with your Mac. In this chapter, you discover how
to design a site, import your own photos, and add all sorts of different pages.
Soon, you’ll proudly hold your head up high and declare to the world, “I am
a Webmaster!”
Looking around the iWeb Window
Everything in iWeb fits into a single window, naturally, just like iPhoto and
iMovie. (I agree with the Apple software designers: Multiple windows equals
confusing.) Figure 7-1 illustrates the iWeb window, complete with a Web site
in progress. The stuff to keep your eye on includes:

Looking around the iWeb Window
368
✦Toolbar: Located at the bottom of the window, the iWeb toolbar keeps
all your major controls one or two clicks away.
The iWeb toolbar contains different buttons, depending on the chore
you’re handling at the moment — Figure 7-1 shows the set of toolbar
buttons that you see when you’re editing a page.
✦Layout: You need elbow room to build a Web page, so the Layout section
of the iWeb interface dominates the window. You create and edit your
pages in the Layout display and then use it to preview and test-drive
your finished site.
✦Site Organizer: The strip to the left of the layout display is the Site
Organizer, which allows you to organize your Web sites, add new pages
to a site, and select an existing page for editing.
Before we get down to business, it’s overview time. You essentially follow
three phases to put your new site on the Web:
1. Decide which pages you need.
2. Create a new site and build those pages.
3. Publish your site to your .Mac account or to a Web server.

I go over each of these phases in order. (They taught me that in college . . .
along with the history of the Aztecs and the wonders of FIFO accounting.)
Planning Your Pages
Every properly designed Web site has a purpose: to inform, to entertain, and
to provide downloads or contact information. The pages you add to your
site should all reflect that common purpose.
iWeb can produce the following types of pages for your site:
✦Welcome: This is the default first page that iWeb adds to a site you
create. The Welcome page familiarizes your visitor with the idea behind
your site, and perhaps offers a snippet of the latest developments on the
site in a “What’s New” paragraph.
✦About Me: This page provides a biography of you or another person,
listing things like your age, favorite songs, and favorite foods. (After all,
that’s important stuff.) Links are provided to your photo album pages
and other Web sites you want to share.
✦Photos: Oh, this is good stuff here — iWeb makes it easy to add one of
those cool online photo galleries for your snapshots, complete with a
Web slideshow! You can add Events and albums from iPhoto, too.
✦My Albums: You can organize all of your Photos and Movie pages on a
single My Albums page. Visitors click on a thumbnail to jump to the cor-
responding page Photos or Movies page — it’s a visual index done the
right way.
✦Movie: Got a QuickTime movie you’ve created with iMovie to share with
others? This is the page that presents it to your adoring fans.
✦Blog: Adding a Blog (or personal Web journal) page is a somewhat differ-
ent beast: iWeb keeps track of each addition you make in an entry list so
that you can quickly add or delete entries without requiring tons of
scrolling, cutting, and pasting. A Blog page also includes an archive so
that deleted entries aren’t lost forever.
✦Podcast: Consider a Podcast as an audio (or audio/visual) blog — it’s
designed to be downloaded to a visitor’s iPod for later enjoyment. Like
the Blog page, a Podcast page has an entry list and an archive list
attached to it.
✦Blank: Yep, an old-fashioned blank page, ready for you to fill with what-
ever you like.

Adding a New Site
370
Before you even launch iWeb, jot down on a piece of paper (or a Stickie)
these important points:
✦What message do I want to communicate to visitors?
✦What tone will I use — funny, serious, or businesslike?
✦What stuff do I want to offer: photos, movies, or Podcasts?
Now you have the starting point for your site and you know what you want
to include . . . so let’s get down with the Web!
Adding a New Site
When you open iWeb for the first time, the application creates a new site for
you, and you can rename and modify this default site to your heart’s content.
In fact, for many of us, one site is all we ever create — but iWeb can easily
handle multiple Web sites, keeping them separate in the Site Organizer.
If there’s at least one existing site in your Site Organizer, iWeb automatically
displays the last site you were working on. Therefore, if you want to create
an entirely new site, you have to perform a little manual labor. Here are a
number of different ways to add a site:
✦Choose File➪New Site.
✦Press Ô+Shift+N.
✦Control-click/right-click in the Site Organizer and click New Site.
iWeb leaps into action and displays the template sheet you see in Figure 7-2.
Scroll through the template themes in the list at the left of the sheet until you
find one that matches the tone you decided on in the previous section —
informal, formal, or silly, iWeb has templates that match every mood! Click a
template on the left, and the application automatically updates the page type
thumbnails on the right.
When you choose a template, iWeb automatically provides your pages with a
common background, color scheme, and fonts so that your finished Web site
has a common theme throughout.
After you find the right look and feel, click the desired template in the scroll-
ing list at the left, click the Welcome page thumbnail, and then click the
Choose button. iWeb creates a new site heading in the Site Organizer, com-
plete with the default Welcome page. Figure 7-1 illustrates the Welcome page
from a new site I created with the Main Event template.

Adding a New Page
If you’re ready to add the pages you plan for your site — for example, I’ve
decided to add Photo and About Me pages to the new site I’ve created. In the
following section, I discuss how to edit these pages to personalize them . . .
but for now, we just want to add the pages.
If you have multiple sites in your Site Organizer list, click the top-level head-
ing for the desired site to select it. You can add pages by
✦Clicking the Add Page button at the bottom of the iWeb window
(which bears a plus sign)
✦Choosing File➪New Page
✦Pressing Ô+N
✦Control-clicking/right-clicking the site header in the Site Organizer
and clicking New Page
Want to start with an existing page as a basis for a new page? Right-click 
that page entry in the Site Organizer and choose Duplicate — iWeb creates a
new page with exactly the same contents and adds it to the site.
Figure 7-2:
Choosing a
template for
a new site.

Editing a Page
372
Pages are listed under the main site heading in outline format, making it easy
to expand or collapse a site by clicking the familiar rotating triangle icon
next to the site heading.
Deleting a page — or a whole site, for that matter — is easy in iWeb. Right-
click the offending page or site heading in the Site Organizer and choose
Delete Page/Delete Site. Note that iWeb doesn’t prompt you for confirmation
here, so these aren’t commands to toy with.
Editing a Page
If you have your site framework complete — you could actually put your 
site on the Internet as is! Of course, the photos would all be of good-looking
strangers, and most of the text would read like Pig Latin nonsense. (Come to
think of it, I’ve been on some real sites that aren’t much better. Go figure.)
I think we both agree, however, that you want to personalize your pages with
your own information. To begin editing a page, click it in the Site Organizer.
Modifying text
First, update the text with your own information by following these steps:
1. Click the text you want to replace.
Like most desktop publishing applications, iWeb uses boxes to enclose
text. When you click the text, the box appears, with handles that you
can drag to resize the box.
2. Begin typing your text.
iWeb replaces the existing template text with the text you type, using the
text formatting taken from the template. Don’t forget that you can paste
text from the clipboard by pressing Ô+V — to match the text style of the
template, though, press Option+Shift+Ô+V.
Mistakes are passé in iWeb. To undo your last action, you can always
press the familiar Ô+Z keyboard shortcut or choose Edit➪Undo.
3. Highlight and format your new text as necessary.
To make changes easier, click the Inspector button in the iWeb toolbar.
The dialog you see in Figure 7-3 appears, allowing you to change text
color, alignment, and spacing with aplomb. (You find more about the
Inspector dialog later.) You can click the Colors or Fonts buttons on the
iWeb toolbar to display a color section wheel or font attributes dialog
for the selected text.
4. Click outside the text box after you’re satisfied with the text.

Chapter 7

Because you’re likely modifying everything on the template pages from the
title to the last box on the page, repeat Steps 1–4 for each section of text you
want to change.
Figure 7-3:
Using the
Inspector
dialog to
format text.
Don’t I have to slave over a hot menu?
You would if you were building a Web site by
hand, or if you were using an old-fashioned Web
creation application not designed by our favorite
company! (Insert smug expression here.)
Let me explain . . . every Web site needs a
series of links called a menu that allows you to
jump from one page of the site to another. (For
instance, you’re probably already familiar with
the “tabbed” menu at the top of the Apple Web
site that you use to flit from the Mac OS X sec-
tion to the Support section to the .Mac section
and back again.) In days of old, a site menu was
often a nightmare to maintain, especially if your
site changed often.
iWeb creates and maintains a menu for each of
your sites automatically and places it at the top
of your pages for you! (You might have noticed
that the Welcome menu item already appears
in Figure 7-1.) When you add or delete pages,
the application updates your menu in the back-
ground.
This is the way software is supposed to be
designed . . . don’t you agree?

Replacing images
If your page includes photographs that you want to change, follow these
steps:
1. Click the image you want to replace.
Like a block of text, iWeb displays a box around the image, complete
with resizing handles.
2. Drag an image to the image box from a Finder window.
Alternately, you can click the Media button in the toolbar, which dis-
plays the Media browser you see in Figure 7-4. From this window, you
can click the Photo tab to choose an image from your iPhoto library.
3. Adjust your new image if necessary.
Click the Adjust button, and iWeb displays a cool semi-opaque dialog
that allows you to tweak image settings, like tint, brightness, and sharp-
ness (see Figure 7-5). Click Enhance to allow iWeb to choose the settings
it considers best for the image or click Reset Image to restore the photo
to its original appearance. When you’re satisfied with the image, click
the Close button on the dialog to return to the image box.

4. Click outside the image box (usually the page background) after
you’re satisfied with the photo.
Again, lather/rinse/repeat for each image you want to change on your page.
Adding new elements
iWeb also makes it easy to add new items to a page. The list of extras includes
✦Photos: To add a new image box to your page, drag a photo from a
Finder window to the iWeb layout section. Click the Media button in the
toolbar to choose an image from your iPhoto library, or throw caution to
the wind and drag an entire Event or an album to your new page! iWeb
takes care of all the details.
✦Movies: Yep, you guessed it, you can drag a movie clip from a Finder
window to your page, or click the Media button in the toolbar to choose
a movie from iMovie or your Movies folder.
✦Text: Choose Insert➪Text or click the Text button in the toolbar.
✦Shapes: Click the Shape button in the toolbar to display the pop-up
menu and then click the desired shape. (Don’t forget to resize it as you
desire with the box handles.)
Figure 7-5:

Editing a Page
376
✦Web Widgets: Click this button to insert a widget (a Web applet) to your
page. For example, HTML Snippet allows you to type HTML code directly
into place on the page, or paste HTML code that you’ve copied from
another Web site. You can also insert interactive Google Adsense adver-
tisements or a Google Map. To populate the page with a .Mac Web
Gallery, choose the .Mac Web Gallery menu item and select a Gallery
you’ve created using the iPhoto Web Gallery feature. (For the complete
scoop on iPhoto, cruise over to Chapter 3 in this mini-book.)
You can move a Web Widget anywhere on a page by dragging it, and it
can be resized just like a text box. 
✦Links: If you’re editing text and you want to insert a Web link, choose
Insert➪Hyperlink and choose from the menu that appears. You can
choose to link to another Web page or insert a link that automatically
sends an e-mail message to the mail address you provide. You can also
offer a file for downloading.
iWeb can automatically detect e-mail and Web addresses that you type
in a text box, so you don’t have to use the Links menu. To enable this
feature, choose iWeb➪Preferences and click the Automatically Detect
Email and Web Addresses check box to enable it.
✦Button: Your Web page can include buttons that allow your visitors to
e-mail you or display the number of hits (visits) your page has received.
Choose Insert➪Button and click an option to add or remove a specific
button. (If the menu option is checked, the button appears on your
page.) Blog and Podcast pages can also offer RSS feeds (for automated
retrieval of new entries within a Web browser), subscriptions to your
Podcasts, and slideshows.
Doing the slideshow thing
Ready to offer a slideshow on your Web site?
Again, we’re talking automation here! Add a
Photo page to your site and notice that the Start
Slideshow button is already in place at the top
of the page. All you need to do is add the photos
to the page, using the Media browser or drag-
ging them from a Finder window. When your
visitors click the Start Slideshow button, all the
photos on the page are displayed in a pop-up
window.
It’s important to note, however, that some
Windows browsers don’t support this Slideshow
feature — other Mac owners using Safari can
enjoy the show, but don’t count on older versions
of Internet Explorer (or Firefox) to be able to
handle it.

With these tools, you can use the Blank page template to create your own
new pages. Personally, I prefer to use the professionally designed templates
offered by Apple as starting points, removing whatever I don’t need and
adding new content.
Most Web designers would strongly recommend that you use a common
theme for all the pages within a site (to lend continuity). Of course, you can
also stick your tongue out at those very same Web designers and can select
a different theme for every page! To select a different theme for a page, open
the page in iWeb and click on the Theme button in the toolbar, then click on
the desired thumbnail from the pop-up menu. Nothing’s lost but the old look
of the page, so feel free to experiment to your heart’s content.
Tweaking with the Inspector
Earlier, you used the Inspector dialog to change text formatting attributes —
but this star performer can do much more than just that! Click the Inspector
button on the iWeb toolbar to display the dialog and then click the first
button (the Site Inspector button, which bears a globe) to change the name
of the selected Web site. You can also verify how much space is available on
your iDisk, which is where iWeb stores your Web sites.
To modify page characteristics, click the page in the Site Organizer, display
the Inspector dialog, and click the Page Inspector button, which carries a
document icon. These settings allow you to change the name of a page; you
can also elect to include or exclude this page from the site menu, or to drop
the site menu from this page.
If your site contains a Blog or Podcast page, you can click the RSS button to
provide an automated RSS (RDF Site Summary) feed to your visitors. (For
more information on RSS and how it works in Safari, see Chapter 5 of Book IV.)
Publishing Your Web Site
Even the best Web site design is worth next to nil if it isn’t available on the
Internet — and in this last section, I demonstrate how to publish your Web
site to your .Mac account or to a separate server maintained by a third party
(perhaps your ISP, your company, or Dave down the street).
After you finish with a new site — or you’re satisfied with the edits you make
to existing pages — iWeb offers the following publishing options:

Publishing Your Web Site
378
✦Publish to your .Mac account: Click the site to select it in the Site
Organizer and then click the Publish button at the bottom of the iWeb
window. The application takes care of everything else, uploading any
changed pages or media. Alternately, you can choose File➪Publish to
.Mac to set the same wheels in motion.
✦Publish All to .Mac: Choose File➪Publish All to .Mac if you want to
refresh all your Web sites to your .Mac account (not just those that
you’ve added or edited).
✦Publish to a Folder: The final publishing option creates a folder on your
hard drive that contains all the files to display your Web site — this is
the option to choose if you’re not a .Mac subscriber or if you want to use
a home or business Web server to host your site on the Internet. If you
provide an RSS feed from your page, you have to type the site URL as it
will appear on the Internet after you copy or upload the site files to the
server.

In This Chapter
 Viewing movies
 Listening to audio
 Converting media to different formats
 Keeping track of your favorite media
 Tweaking QuickTime preferences
QuickTime is a set of exciting technologies that gives you access to the
greatest multimedia experience around. Despite its power, don’t be
surprised if you don’t even realize that you’re using it sometimes. Built with
the average Joe in mind, QuickTime takes multimedia to new heights with-
out forcing its users to become rocket scientists in the process. And dig that
sassy chrome sheen — not bad for a software application!
QuickTime Can Do That?
QuickTime was created by Apple to perform all sorts of multimedia func-
tions. Although normally associated with movie playback, QuickTime can do
much more. Whether movies, audio, animation, or music, QuickTime acts as
the main engine that drives all your multimedia needs.
✦Media player: QuickTime’s main claim to fame is playing all sorts of
media — and I do mean all sorts. Table 8-1 lists the most popular of the
media types that QuickTime can play.
The real beauty of QuickTime is that it transparently handles playback
of all these media formats and more. You don’t even really have to know
what each of these formats is to play them. QuickTime takes care of that
for you.
✦File converter: The world of multimedia includes all kinds of file for-
mats — so many, in fact, that it can take a rocket scientist to figure them
all out. Fortunately, beyond its abilities as a world-class media player,
QuickTime also has a full suite of conversion tools at its heart. QuickTime
can import many kinds of media and spit them back out into practically

Playing Media with QuickTime

any other format that it supports. Again, QuickTime handles the messy
details behind the scenes for you. You don’t need to know a .mov file
from an .mp4 file to import and export to and from either format.
QuickTime’s got you covered.
✦Internet media tool: When it comes to using media from the Internet,
QuickTime is in a league all its own. With its plug-in feature, QuickTime
takes its functionality to the Web browser. In addition to playing the
usual movies and audio files found on the World Wide Web, QuickTime
can play (or display) 3-D scenes and animations. If that weren’t enough,
QuickTime even lets you interact with some media. For example, with
QuickTime, you can navigate within 3-D worlds or play Flash games.

Playing Media with QuickTime
QuickTime makes a world of movies, audio, graphics, and music instantly
available to you. Whether you want to view professional movie trailers or
listen to a garage band’s new single, QuickTime faithfully reproduces nearly
any media format that you feed it.
At the center of the action: QuickTime Player
At the heart of QuickTime’s playback functionality is the QuickTime Player
application. To launch QuickTime Player, double-click its icon in the Finder.
You can also launch QuickTime Player from the Finder by double-clicking a
media file that QuickTime can play. (See Table 8-1 earlier in this chapter for a
listing of these file types.)

Book III
Chapter 8
No, It’s Not Called
iQuickTime
Playing Media with QuickTime
381
Don’t make the mistake of thinking that QuickTime and QuickTime Player
are the same thing: QuickTime is a technology that hides in the background
waiting for instructions to do something with media; QuickTime Player is an
application that uses the QuickTime technologies. You’ll do media conver-
sions, playback, and editing with QuickTime Player. What you won’t see is
the QuickTime technology in action behind the scenes.
You can also launch QuickTime Player from its oh-so-convenient Dock icon.
For more on the Dock, read Book II, Chapter 2.
QuickTime has two versions: free or Pro. The main differences between the
free and Pro versions of QuickTime lie in the QuickTime Player application
itself. The free version just plays media, and the Pro version adds extra fea-
tures to QuickTime Player, such as converting ’twixt different media formats
and full-screen playback. If you’re using QuickTime Pro, all items listed in
this chapter will work as described.
If, however, you notice that a feature is dimmed out or missing altogether,
you might be using the free QuickTime license. To find out whether you’re
using a free or Pro license, open the System Preferences and navigate to the
QuickTime panel. If you’ve registered as a QuickTime Pro user, you can find
its registration information here, as shown in Figure 8-1. If you’re not a regis-
tered user, you can purchase the upgrade at www.apple.com/quicktime.
The upgrade costs $29.99, at the time of this writing.
Opening QuickTime movies
To begin viewing and hearing — aw, what the heck, how about absorbing —
multimedia files, choose File➪Open File from the QuickTime Player applica-
tion. This isn’t the only way to open a file with QuickTime Player, though.
Some of the other ways to open files with QuickTime Player are
Figure 8-1:

Playing Media with QuickTime
382
✦Drag a file to the QuickTime Player icon on the Dock.
✦Right-click (or Control-click) a movie and choose Open With; then
choose QuickTime Player from the pop-up menu.
✦Double-click the media file in the Finder. If it has a QuickTime-style
icon (a blue letter Q), it opens automatically in QuickTime Player.
Operating QuickTime Player
When you open a QuickTime file, QuickTime Player creates a new window to
display it. All QuickTime Player windows share some common features:
✦Close, Minimize, and Zoom controls: These three controls appear at the
top left-hand corner of most windows in Mac OS X. You probably recog-
nize them by their colors: red, yellow, and green, respectively.
✦Resize handle: Drag the lower right-hand corner of QuickTime Player to
resize its movie for playback. Hold Shift while dragging to break free
from constrained resizing. If the document contains only sound media,
the window grows or shrinks in a horizontal direction when you resize it.
Any resizing that you perform makes no changes to the original file.
QuickTime provides it for your convenience during playback.
Although some window features are common to all QuickTime Player win-
dows, many features depend on the type of media that you wish to play.
Table 8-2 lists some of the window features that you might find and the
media types associated with those features.

To make your life easier, QuickTime does a lot of work for you behind the
scenes each time that it opens a media file. Although you might think that
there are different combinations of controls in QuickTime Player, the reality
is that the various media windows are more similar than they are different.
Figure 8-2 shows the location of various QuickTime Player controls.
Playing media
Playback begins as you might suspect — by clicking the Play button. While a
file is playing, the Play button toggles to a Stop button. Click that button to
stop playback, which toggles the button back to Play.
Clicking the buttons with double-arrows on them advances the playback
head at high speed in the direction of the arrows. If the file has audio in it,
you hear the playback at high speed, which sounds like an episode of those
helium-inhaling Chipmunks. (Remember? Meee, I waaant a hooola hooop.)
Despite its comical sound, it’s helpful for quickly scanning through a file. Click
the buttons with a single arrow to advance to the beginning or end of a file.
You can also advance through the file by dragging the playback head in
either direction. This action is permissible while the file is playing or when
it’s stopped. Unlike when you use the buttons, however, you miss out on the
high-speed sound and video.
To adjust the volume of a movie, simply move the volume slider left or right.

Advanced playback features
QuickTime Player offers advanced playback features that go beyond simple
play and stop functions. Keep in mind, however, that some of the advanced
features of QuickTime Player are meant only for registered QuickTime Pro
users. The general rule is that registered Pro users of QuickTime Player can
modify QuickTime content. If you aren’t registered as a QuickTime Pro user,
you can take advantage of only playback features in QuickTime Player.
Video playback
To adjust video playback quality, choose Window➪Show A/V Controls or
press Ô+K. When you do, QuickTime presents you with the A/V Controls
dialog. The audio and video settings that you can change from this dialog
(see Figure 8-3) include

Looping features
Sometimes you might want to play a piece of media more than once. In these
situations, you need to loop the playback. To force a movie to loop, choose
View➪Loop or press Ô+L. Press Ô+L again to turn off looping.
If you want to get fancy, you can also play a movie in a forward direction fol-
lowed by playback in reverse. Apple calls this looping back and forth. To do
this, choose View➪Loop Back and Forth.
Movie info
To see more information about the files that you’re playing, ask the expert:
QuickTime Player. To view basic information about a movie, choose Window➪
Show Movie Info or press Ô+I. The resulting window displays the following
data:
✦Source: Location of the file
✦Format: Compressor and dimensions of the file
✦FPS: Preferred rate of playback in frames per second (fps)
✦Playing FPS: Actual rate of playback in fps (available during playback
only)
✦Data Size: Size of the file
✦Data Rate: Preferred rate of playback (in bytes per second)
✦Current Time: Position of the playback head (in units of time)
✦Duration: Length of the movie file (in units of time)

Playing Media with QuickTime
386
✦Normal Size: Default movie dimensions
✦Current Size: Actual movie dimensions (if you’ve resized the movie
since opening the file)
These bits and pieces of information are read-only — you can’t change them
from the Movie Info window.
Movie properties
In addition to general movie information, you can also peek inside a QuickTime
movie to see what makes it tick. To display the Movie Properties window,
choose Window➪Show Movie Properties or press Ô+J.
The Movie Properties window displays the audio and video tracks in the list
at the top of the window. Select a track and click one of the panel buttons to
display things like the Audio Settings for the track or the general settings
you can change. (The panel buttons you see depend on what type of item
you’ve selected in the list.)
Yep, that’s correct, these settings you can change because they’re not read-
only. For example, to rotate or flip a movie’s video track, follow these steps:
1. With QuickTime Player, open a QuickTime movie.
2. Press Ô+J to open its Movie Properties window.
3. From the Tracks list at the top of the Properties window, choose the
first available Video Track.
4. Click the Visual Settings panel button.
Back on track
Every file that you open with QuickTime Player
consists of one or more tracks. A track contains
one (and only one) type of media. For example,
a typical QuickTime movie might comprise two
tracks:
 Video track: Stores the video data of the
movie
 Sound track: Stores the audio data of the
movie
In contrast, opening an audio file with Quick-
Time Player might have only a single sound
track. Other files don’t have a video or sound
track at all: Shockwave and Flash (.swf) files,
for example, usually contain only one Flash
track. MIDI files have yet another type of track.
Luckily, QuickTime makes it simple for you to
ignore these technical trivia facts altogether
(which most of us prefer).

5. Click the Flip or Rotate buttons.
6. After you adjust the track’s orientation to your liking, close the Movie
Properties window.
If you want to save your movie with the new video track, don’t forget to
press Ô+S — or press Shift+Ô+S to save the altered movie under another
name.
QuickTime: The Super Converter
QuickTime Pro also makes a great tool for converting media files. As your
collection of multimedia grows, you’ll eventually find yourself wishing that
certain files were in a different format. For example, you might want to con-
vert a QuickTime movie to a digital video (DV) file for use with a third-party
video editing application. With a few clicks, QuickTime Pro can open a media
file in one of dozens of formats and convert it to most any other format that
QuickTime understands. To do so, you must import the file into QuickTime
and then export it into the format that you prefer.
Importing and Exporting Files
Earlier in this chapter, I discussed how loading (or importing) a file in
QuickTime Player is as easy as using the File➪Open File menu item, or
simply by double-clicking the file icon. (No need to wait until a file has fin-
ished playing . . . you can begin converting it immediately.)
After you open or import a media file, QuickTime Pro lets you export it to
one of many formats. For example, you might export a QuickTime movie to
an AVI movie for those Windows users who don’t have QuickTime installed.
To export a movie, choose File➪Export. In the dialog that appears, select the
desired output format from the Export pop-up menu. Each export type also
has a set of options. To view them, click the Options button on the right side
of the Export dialog. You can also choose to rename the file or specify a dif-
ferent location on your system where the exported file should be saved.
If you’d like to share a multimedia file with others as an e-mail attachment or
from your .Mac homepage on the Web, choose File➪Share instead. After
you’ve typed a name for your new file and selected the size you want to
send, click Share and QuickTime automatically launches Apple Mail or loads
the .Mac HomePage site in Safari to help simplify the process. Slick as a wet
toad!

Although QuickTime Player and Pro are great at actively loading, exporting,
and altering all kinds of media, most Mac OS X owners don’t care about
these features. For those who could care less what the media type is for an
e-mail attachment, QuickTime transparently handles the chore of displaying
the file without having to know all the technical details behind it. With
QuickTime as your ally, you can watch the latest Star Wars movie trailer,
view an image in a Web page, or (if you’re like me) you can listen to Bob
Hope jaw with Bing Crosby (if you have a collection of classic radio shows in
MP3 format). QuickTime makes a great tool for viewing and exploring all
sorts of exciting multimedia content.
Favorites
The quickest way to keep track of your media files is with the Favorites
menu. It offers one-click access to the media files that you use most. To add
a file to the Favorites menu, do the following:
1. Open your favorite media file.
2. Press Ô+D or choose Window➪Favorites➪Add Movie as Favorite.
Now, anytime you want to watch and/or hear this file, you simply choose it
from the Favorites menu.
Recording audio and video in QuickTime Player
Most folks don’t think of QuickTime as a record-
ing application . . . that’s because Apple pro-
vides applications (like Photo Booth, iMovie,
and iTunes) that have long been the recording
tools of choice in the Mac universe. However,
you can indeed record audio and video with
QuickTime Player, as long as your Mac is
equipped with the proper hardware (a micro-
phone or line-in device for audio, and an iSight
camera or external video camera for video).
If you’re recording video, first set the Recording
preferences in the QuickTime Player Preferences
dialog — you can get there by pressing Ô+,
(comma) or by clicking QuickTime Player and
then clicking Preferences. Click the Recording
button on the toolbar and set your recording
input source, the quality of the video, and the
default location where the video files will be
stored.
When you’re ready to record, click File and
choose either New Movie Recording or New
Audio Recording. This is a one-click operation:
Click the Big Red Button to start and stop
recording. QuickTime displays both the record-
ing time and the approximate hard drive space
used so far. ’Nuff said.

You can remove files later from the Favorites menu by performing these
steps:
1. Choose Window➪Favorites➪Show Favorites.
2. In the Favorites window that appears, select the file that you wish to
remove.
3. Press the Delete key to remove the file from the Favorites menu.
Free content for all
QuickTime Player offers you one-click access to a variety of multimedia con-
tent, including news, entertainment, and educational features. Naturally, an
Internet connection is required. To view the QuickTime Player Content
Guide, click Window and click Show Content Guide (see Figure 8-4).
When you do, a new window opens in the Player — this is the Content
Guide’s main menu. From here, you can click any of the provided links just
as you might click a link in a Web page.
Clicking any item in the Content Guide opens a Web page in your preferred
browser.
QuickTime and your browser
QuickTime is equally at home in a Web browser. Like the QuickTime Player
application, the QuickTime Web plug-in offers convenient playback utilities

directly in your Web browser. To view a movie in a browser window, simply
navigate to a Web page that contains a QuickTime movie; QuickTime auto-
matically loads the movie and plays it in the Web page. In many cases, you
can even save a movie from a Web page — just click the triangle icon at the
far right of the movie controller, or Control-click/right-click in the movie
window. A menu appears, giving you two options to save the movie: Choosing
Save as Source saves the file in the format in which you originally down-
loaded it, and choosing Save as QuickTime Movie converts the file to a
QuickTime movie.
To aid your quest for QuickTime content on the Web, Apple hosts a vast
array of materials on its site. You can find movie trailers, free tunes from
your favorite artists, game trailers, and Internet radio news at this site:
www.apple.com/quicktime
Tweaking QuickTime
After you’re comfortable using QuickTime for media playback, you might
want to expand your horizons. QuickTime has many features — so many, in
fact, that it requires two different Preference windows to handle them all.
Setting QuickTime Player preferences
As I mention earlier in the chapter, you can open the QuickTime Player
Preferences dialog by choosing QuickTime Player➪Preferences. A General
Preferences dialog appears with a number of settings that affect how the
QuickTime Player application works.
Working with QuickTime preferences
To open the Preferences for QuickTime, do one of the following:
✦Open System Preferences and click the QuickTime icon.
✦In the QuickTime Player application, choose QuickTime Player➪
QuickTime Preferences.
Click the various tabs of the QuickTime Preferences to change its settings.
Besides the Registration panel, which I discuss at the beginning of the chap-
ter, the QuickTime Preferences consist of four other panels:

QuickTime to update itself.
✦Streaming: QuickTime can tailor your online multimedia experience to
the speed of your Internet connection. Tell QuickTime what speed your
connection uses, and it takes care of the rest.
✦Advanced: QuickTime can do music! Select QuickTime’s synthesizer in

Chapter 9: Turning Your 
Mac into a DVD Theater
In This Chapter
 What you need to watch DVDs on your Macintosh
 Using the DVD Player software
 Mysteries of the hidden controls unearthed
A
ll the creative capabilities of the Mac OS X digital hub are a lot of fun,
but at some point, you’ll want to take a break from work. In recent
years, DVDs have exploded onto the home entertainment scene; because of
its high fidelity, convenience, and seemingly limitless storage capacity, the
DVD has taken consumers by storm. The idea of an honest-to-goodness
theater in your home is now within the grasp of mere mortals (with, coinci-
dentally, merely average budgets). Mac OS X has everything that you’ll need
to enjoy a night at the movies without ever leaving home. In fact, I highly
recommend the new 24-inch Intel iMac or the 17-inch MacBook Pro for those
wide-screen classics.
The DVD Hardware
Before you watch one second of film, get your setup in order. Playing DVDs
requires a bit of hardware; fortunately, most recent Macintosh computers
come equipped with the stuff that’s necessary to watch DVDs.
To play DVD movies, you’ll need either an internal DVD-compatible drive in
your Macintosh or an external DVD drive with a FireWire or USB 2.0 connec-
tion. DVD-ROM drives (and Apple’s Combo drives) can only play discs, while
others, like the SuperDrive, can both play and record discs. Either type of
drive will work fine for watching movies on your Mac.
You can watch any standard DVD that you purchase at your local video
store as well as any DVD that you create with iDVD. (For more on iDVD 5,
Read Book III, Chapter 5.)

The DVD Player: It’s Truly Shiny
394
The DVD Player: It’s Truly Shiny
To watch Frodo Baggins, Don Corleone, or James Bond, you’ll need DVD
player software. Mac OS X comes stocked with the perfect tool for the task:
DVD Player.
Apple’s DVD Player application is included with Mac OS X — you’ll find it
within the confines of your Applications folder. But instead of rooting
through the Finder, you can launch DVD Player an even easier way: Simply
insert a DVD into the drive. As soon as you do, your Mac recognizes the disc
and launches DVD Player by default for you. (Time for another round of well-
deserved gloating about your choice of personal computer.)
This automatic behavior can be curbed, however. You can control what
action Leopard takes (if any) when you load a DVD via the CDs & DVDs panel
within System Preferences. For all the details, visit Book II, Chapter 3.
However you choose to start DVD Player, you’ll notice that it offers two 
windows:
✦Controller: The small, silver-colored, remote control–looking interface
that holds all the controls for the Player
✦Viewer: The large window where you view your DVD movies
In full-screen mode, the controller appears as a floating opaque strip of con-
trols along the bottom of the screen — to display the controls, move your
mouse cursor to the bottom of the screen.
If you’re already using a traditional DVD player, you’ll be right at home with
Apple’s DVD Player. Even if you’ve never used a traditional DVD player, it’s
not much different than using a software-based audio player like iTunes.
Using the Controller
The Controller is the command center of the DVD Player software. Arranged
much like a VCR or tape deck, all the familiar controls are present. Check it
out in Figure 9-1.
Table 9-1 details the fundamental commands present in the DVD Player
Controller. Apple software usually has some goodies hidden beneath the sur-
face, and DVD Player is no exception. The controls in DVD Player have a few
functions that might not be obvious to the casual user. These are listed in
the third column of Table 9-1.

Jumping right to the flying-monkey action
Movies on DVD usually are divided into chap-
ters that enable you to jump directly to specific
points. That way, you can jump right to the
scene, say, where the flying monkey guards
march into the Wicked Witch’s castle in The
Wizard of Oz. (Or skip that egg-hatching scene
in Alien that always makes you nauseous.) You
can navigate to chapters, play the movie from
the beginning, or check out special bonus fea-
tures (such as trailers and documentaries) from
the DVD’s main menu.

Keep your eyes on the Viewer
As soon as you begin playing with the DVD Player controls, you’ll notice
activity in the Viewer window, as shown in Figure 9-2.
You can think of the Viewer window as a television inside your Macintosh if
it helps, but DVD Player goes one step further. Unlike a television screen, the
Viewer has some nice tricks up its sleeve: For example, you can resize the
Viewer window by using one of the four sizes listed in the View menu (half,
actual size, double size, Fit to Screen, and full-screen sizes). This is useful for
watching a movie in a small window on your Desktop while you work with
other applications. From the keyboard, you can toggle your Viewer size from
the keyboard; for example, select half-size with Ô+0 (zero), actual size with
Ô+1 (one), and double size with Ô+2 (two).
If you’re only in it for the entertainment factor, you’ll probably want to resize
the Viewer to fill the screen. I like to watch movies in full screen mode, which
you can toggle with the Ô+F keyboard shortcut. If you want to take full
advantage of all your screen space yet leave the Viewer window onscreen 
for occasional resizing, choose Fit to Screen mode with Ô+3 (three).
Taking Advantage of Additional DVD Features
As anyone with a little DVD experience knows, DVDs can do a lot more than
those archaic tapes that you used to feed your VCR. Apple has included sev-
eral functions that allow you to explore the extra features and content pro-
vided with a DVD movie.

Controller extras
To use the additional Controller features, double-click the small tab at the
rightmost (or bottom) edge of the DVD Player Controller. After you do, a
trick drawer slides out, displaying the extra controls. (See Figure 9-3.) You
can also display or hide the drawer with the Controls➪Open/Close Control
Drawer menu command or by pressing Ô+] (that’s the right bracket key).
Are you interested in fine-tuning the audio from your DVD movies? If so,
choose Window➪Audio Equalizer, and DVD Player displays a ten-band equal-
izer. (I often use this feature to add extra bass to a concert DVD.) Click the
list box at the upper right of the Equalizer window, and you can choose a
preset (like Bass Boost or Vocal Boost), or even create your own custom
audio presets.
Table 9-2 summarizes the functions that you can perform with these addi-
tional controls.

Bookmark, or press Ô+= (the equal sign key). DVD Player even allows you to
name the bookmark so it’s easier to remember. To return to a bookmark,
choose Go➪Bookmarks and click the desired bookmark.
DVD Player preferences
The DVD Player application has a variety of settings that you can access and
adjust via its Preferences window. To open the Preferences window, choose
DVD Player➪Preferences. This brings up the Preferences dialog.
This window consists of six panels:
✦Player: Settings that affect how DVD Player operates
✦Disc Setup: Settings for Audio, Subtitles, Language, and the Web
✦Full Screen: Settings that determine your full-screen viewing configuration
✦Windows: Settings for displaying onscreen information during playback
✦Previously Viewed: Settings that determine what happens when you
load a DVD that you watched already
✦High Definition: Settings that specify how high-definition video is dis-
played on your Mac
The advantage of these Preference settings is that you can customize your
copy of DVD Player to match your needs or desires. (Thanks yet again to the
Cupertino Crowd!)
Player
The Player settings take care of much of the automation within DVD Player.
✦When DVD Player Opens: These two check boxes affect what happens
when you launch the DVD Player application. You can force DVD Player
to play in full-screen mode and automatically begin playback every time
you start the application.
✦When DVD Player is Inactive: If you’re multitasking while watching your
movie in windowed mode, you can click another window to make it
active. This check box determines whether DVD Player will automati-
cally pause while you’re working in that other application.
✦When a Disc Is Inserted: Besides automatic playback on startup, you
can also make DVD Player start playing a disc automatically when the
application is running already. (To illustrate: If this check box is dis-
abled, loading a new disc won’t automatically start it playing if DVD
Player is already running.)

✦When Muted: Do you answer a lot of telephone calls while you sneak a
quick DVD movie at work? If so, enable this option . . . if you have to
press the Mute button on your keyboard while a movie is playing, DVD
Player automatically adds the subtitles/closed captions so that you can
keep up with the dialog. Super sassy!
✦During iChat with Audio: Another option for those who like multiple
applications at once. If you’re watching a DVD and start an audio chat in
iChat AV, you can choose to either mute the DVD audio or pause the
DVD playback until you click Play again.
✦When Viewer Is Minimized: Watching a DVD at the office, eh? Enable
this check box, and DVD Player automatically pauses the movie when
you minimize the DVD Player window. (Managers label this feature down-
right sneaky.)
Disc Setup
The second tab of the Player Preferences window consists of these controls:
✦Language: Sprechen Sie Deutsch? DVDs are designed to be multilanguage-
aware. Feel like brushing up on your German, Spanish, or Chinese? You
can control the language used for the audio, subtitling, and menus in
this section.
✦Internet: Some DVDs with DVD@ccess support can access information
on the Internet. Mark this check box to allow that function.
✦Audio: Click this pop-up menu to specify the default audio output signal
that you’d like to use. You can also choose to disable the Dolby dynamic
range compression feature, which might enhance the sound for two-
speaker systems — however, you don’t want to damage the lower-output
speakers on a MacBook or MacBook Pro, so I recommend that laptop
owners leave dynamic range compression enabled.
Multiple languages and Web access are not mandatory features of a DVD, so
don’t be surprised if you see variations of support when it comes to these
settings.
Full Screen
These Preference settings control the default screen display settings within
DVD Player.
✦Controller: I generally like to hide the Controller after a defined time of
inactivity; select the Hide Controller If Inactive for xx Seconds check box
if you agree. To set the delay period, click in the seconds box and type a
new value.

Taking Advantage of Additional DVD Features
400
✦Displays: These options specify how DVD Player shares your Desktop
with others: politely or downright rude. You can choose to automatically
dim other monitors while a movie is playing (if you have more than one
display connected to your Mac), and DVD Player can stay in full-screen
mode even if another application actually has the active window. Finally,
you can choose to remove the menu bar altogether (often called kiosk
mode), which helps cut down on interruptions and accidents if small
hands are nearby — and you can optionally allow Leopard’s screen
saver to appear on the DVD menu in kiosk mode.
Windows
This panel gives you the chance to configure the behavior of the Controller
and status information for the Viewer window.
✦Options: Mark the Display Status Information check box, and DVD Player
adds a small text box at the top-left corner of the Viewer window. In this
text box, you see the name of the last task that you performed with DVD
Player. For example, click the Stop button to see the word Stop dis-
played in the Viewer on top of the video beneath it. You can also set the
Controller to fade away instead of just disappearing — it’s eye candy,
but doggone it, it’s good eye candy!
✦Closed Captioned: If you do decide to display the closed caption text
from a DVD movie, you can click the color buttons to specify the text
color. You can also choose the font for your text. Heck, if your Mac has a
powerful-enough video card, you can choose to make these lines of text
semitransparent to boot. (Think Return of the Son of Eye Candy.)
Previously Viewed
This panel controls what happens when you load a disc that you’ve seen
already . . . or perhaps your significant other watched it and didn’t tell you.
(Insert growling noise here.)
✦Start Playing Discs From: If you have to quit DVD Player for some
reason, the application is smart enough to remember where you were . . .
and you can choose to begin watching from the beginning, from the last
position (where you were when you stopped the last time), or from a
default bookmark. Alternatively, just select Always Ask, and DVD Player
will prompt you each time that this situation crops up.
✦Always Use Disc Settings For: Enable these check boxes to specify
whether DVD Player should use the same settings you used the last time
you watched this disc.

High Definition
The final DVD Player Preferences panel specifies how both standard DV and
high-definition video from a Blu-ray or HD-DVD disc are displayed within the
Viewer window. (As I mentioned earlier, the Viewer window size can also be
changed from the View menu, but the settings in this pane control what
defaults DVD Player uses.)
✦For Standard Definition: You can choose to display the actual video size
by default, or to use the default size provided by the DVD.
✦For High Definition: These options affect how a high-definition video
signal is displayed. Your choices include the actual video size, a height
of 720 pixels, or a height of 1080 pixels.
Don’t forget to click OK to save any changes that you make to your DVD
Player preferences.
After you have your DVD Player customized to your liking, get out the pop-
corn, pull up your favorite recliner, and let the movies roll!

Chapter 1: Getting on the Internet
In This Chapter
 Selecting an Internet service provider (ISP)
 Understanding how your Mac gets on the Internet
 Setting up your Internet connection
I
’ll be honest — the Internet is a terribly complex monster of a network. 
If you tried to fathom all the data that’s exchanged on the Internet and
everything that takes place when you check your e-mail for Aunty Joan’s
fruitcake recipe, your brain would probably melt like a chocolate bar in the
Sahara Desert. A shoebox full of archaic things is tucked under the Internet:
communications protocols, routing addresses, packets, servers, and other
hoo-hah that’re beyond the grasp of just about everyone on the planet.
Luckily for regular folks like you and me, Mac OS X Leopard closes the trap-
door on all these details, keeping them hidden (as they should be). You don’t
have to worry about them, and the obscure information that you need in
order to establish an Internet connection is kept to a minimum. In fact, the
happiest computer owners that I’ve met think that the Internet is a little
blinking light on their DSL or cable modem: If the light blinks in the proper
manner, all is well. (I don’t argue with them.)
In this chapter, I provide help and advice to those who are searching for an
on-ramp to the Information Superhighway — and I lead you through the pro-
cedure of adding an Internet connection under Mac OS X. (In other words,
you’ll get your light blinking properly.)
If you entered your Internet configuration information while you were 
in the Setup Assistant during the installation of Mac OS X — or if you
upgraded to Mac OS X from Mac OS 9, and you already had a working
Internet connection — you can skip this chapter! The information contained
herein is only for those who add or change their Internet connectivity after
installing Mac OS X.

Shopping for an ISP
406
Shopping for an ISP
Before you can connect to the Internet, you must sign up for Internet access.
If you already have an ISP (acronym-speak for an Internet service provider) or
your company provides Internet access, smile quietly to yourself and skip to
the next section. Otherwise, hang around while I discuss what to look for in
an ISP and how to locate one in your local area.
ISPs are as thick as Louisiana mosquitoes these days, and often they’re
judged solely by the amount that they charge for basic access. Cost defi-
nitely is a factor, but it’s not the only thing that should determine your
choice in a service provider. Consider these guidelines when choosing or
switching ISPs:
✦Local calling rates: If you live in a rural area and you’re using a dialup
modem, check to make sure that all prospective ISPs offer local calling
rates. Believe me, no matter how much fun and how useful the Internet
is, it’s not worth hours of long-distance charges. (Oh, and don’t forget to
make sure that your ISP has local access numbers in the cities that you
visit regularly.) If your Mac doesn’t have an internal modem, you can
always add an external USB modem for dialup Internet access and
faxing.
✦Broadband service: Virtually all ISPs now offer digital subscriber line
(DSL) or cable modem access. Collectively, these connections are called
broadband because they offer the fastest method of transferring informa-
tion to and from the Internet. If you have a home business, a large family,
or students — or you telecommute to your office — using broadband
can make your life much simpler.
✦Quality technical support: A 24-hour/7-day telephone support line is a
godsend for the Internet novice — don’t settle for voice support during
business hours. Forget e-mail-based support, too; your e-mail applica-
tion will be dead and gone if your Internet connection gives you prob-
lems. (Sound of your palm whacking your forehead.)
✦Static IP addresses: A static IP address — the unique number that identi-
fies your computer on the Internet — allows you to set up a professional
Web server or File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server. (More on these adven-
tures later in Book VII, Chapter 4.) Most ISPs charge an additional amount
for a static IP address, so it’s not really a good idea for a typical Mac
owner at home. Suffice it to say, however, that a business or commercial
organization running a Web server or FTP server will benefit from a
static IP address.
✦E-mail accounts: Investigate how many individual accounts that you
receive with various ISPs. Also, find out whether you can maintain them

Book IV
Chapter 1
Getting on the
Internet
Investigating Various Types of Connections
407
yourself through a Web site. If so, that’s a good sign. Additionally, if the
prospective ISP provides a Web site where you can read and send e-mail
messages, you can stay on top of your e-mail even while you’re on the
road or vacationing halfway across the globe.
✦Web space: If you want your ISP to host your Web site, this is a no-
brainer: The more space you get, the better. A minimum of 5MB is
acceptable, but most ISPs provide 10MB or 20MB these days. Also,
beware of ISPs that charge you for your Web site if it receives a large
amount of traffic: It can be expensive to host a popular Web site if you
join one of these ISPs.
✦Domain name service: Finally, the better class of ISP also offers a
domain name service, which allows you to register something like your
namehere.com. For the most professional appearance, you can usually
pay a yearly fee, and the ISP takes care of all the details in setting up
your own .com or .org domain name.
Locating an ISP is much easier in the modern Internet-savvy world than it
was just two or three years ago. In the order that you should try them, here
are the tricks that I recommend for finding your local ISPs:
✦Check with your cable or telephone companies. If you’re already sub-
scribing to cable service in your area, you’re likely to be a candidate for
cable Internet access. Also, many local phone companies offer DSL
access, but that access area is often limited to certain locations. Call the
customer service numbers for these companies and check out what they
offer — and don’t forget that a broadband cable or DSL connection is
always more expensive than an old-fashioned, dialup connection.
(“Maude, did you see the Internet bill this month?”)
✦Get recommendations from friends and neighbors. Folks love to give
free advice: Ask them how much they’re paying, how reliable the con-
nection has been, and how well they rate the ISP’s technical support.
✦Check your phone directory. Check the phone book for Internet 
service.
✦Investigate ISP Web sites. If you have Internet access at work, a friend’s
house, or your local public library, you can surf to The List (www.the
list.com) where you can search for ISPs within your area code and
location.
Investigating Various Types of Connections
Next, consider the types of connections that are available under Leopard 
to link your Mac to said ISP. You can choose from four pathways to digital
freedom:

Investigating Various Types of Connections
408
✦A dialup connection: Old-fashioned, yes. Slow as an arthritic burro,
indeed. However, an analog (or telephone modem) connection is still the
primary method for reaching the Internet for most computer owners. It’s
the cheapest method available, and all you need for this type of connec-
tion is a standard telephone jack and a modem. Apple used to include a
modem with every computer, but no longer . . . these days, you’ll have to
buy an external USB modem to make the dialup connection. (Apple
makes one, or any Mac OS X-compatible USB modem will work fine.)
✦A broadband connection: Be it through DSL (which uses a standard
telephone line) or cable (which uses your cable TV wiring), broadband
Internet access is many times faster than a dialup connection. Plus, 
both these technologies are always-on, meaning that your computer is
automatically connected to the Internet when you turn it on and that
connection stays active. With DSL or cable, there’s no squeaky whine
that accompanies your modem making a connection each time that you
want to check your movie listings Web site. Both DSL and cable require a
special piece of hardware (commonly called a modem, but it really isn’t);
this box is usually thrown in as part of your ISP charge. Broadband con-
nections usually require a professional installation, too.
✦A satellite connection: If you’re really out there — miles and miles away
from any cable or DSL phone service — you can still get high-speed
Internet access. The price for a satellite connection is usually much
steeper than a standard DSL or cable connection, but it’s available any-
where you can plant your antenna dish with a clear view of the sky. Plus,
a satellite connection is actually faster than other types of broadband
Oh, please! Not ISDN!
If you’re thinking, “Hey, Mark, you forgot ISDN!”
allow me to reply, “So did everyone else.” I
don’t mean to anger all those prophets who
predicted that we’d all be using Integrated
Services Digital Network (ISDN) by now, but
the truth is that ISDN turned into a joke.
Essentially, ISDN was the ancestor of DSL,
which actually realized the potential of the idea.
ISDN, which was the first broadband connec-
tion method to use regular phone lines, was
supposed to revolutionize the Internet almost a
decade ago (along with curing male pattern
baldness and explaining UFO abductions).
Unfortunately, ISDN technology requires all
sorts of very complex and expensive hardware,
and it really isn’t as fast as all that — most
cable modem Internet access is much faster.
(Consider what happens to the first entry in just
about any technological advance . . . sigh.)
ISDN was quickly eclipsed by the other broad-
band technologies . . . therefore, its abbrevia-
tion has come to mean It Still Does Nothing, and
anyone with an option to use DSL or cable
should give ISDN a wide berth.

access. Older satellite technologies actually required you to also use a
dialup connection — and the antenna could only receive, not send —
but most ISPs that can handle satellite connections now offer satellite
systems that both send and receive through the dish.
✦A network connection: The last type of connection concerns those
Macs that are part of a local area network (LAN) either at the office or in
your home. If your Mac is connected to a LAN that already has Internet
access, you don’t need an ISP at all, and no other hardware is required:
Simply contact your network administrator, buy that important person a
steak dinner, and ask to be connected to the Internet. On the other hand,
if your network currently has no Internet access, you’re back to Square
One: You’ll need one of the previous three types of connections.
After you connect one of your computers on your network to the Internet,
you can use an Internet sharing device to allow all the computers to share
that Internet connection. Book V, Chapter 5 goes into all the details on shar-
ing an Internet connection on a network.
Setting Up Your Internet Connection
Okay, so you sign up for Internet access, and your ISP sends you a sheet of
paper covered with indecipherable stuff that looks like Egyptian hieroglyphics.
Don’t worry; those are the settings that you need to connect to your ISP. After
you get them in Mac OS X, you should be surfing the Web like an old pro.
Before you jump into this configuration, make sure that you’ve configured
the Internet settings within System Preferences, as I discuss in Book II,
Chapter 3. That way, you’ll already have entered your default e-mail and 
Web settings.
Using an internal or external modem
Follow these steps to set up your Internet connection if you’re using your
Mac’s internal modem, or an external USB modem:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock and choose Network.
2. Select Internal Modem or External modem from the Show pop-up
menu.
3. Click the TCP/IP tab and enter the settings for the type of connection
that your ISP provides:
• If your ISP tells you to use PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol): Click the
Configure IPv4 pop-up menu and choose Using PPP. If your ISP pro-
vided you with DNS Server or Search Domain addresses, type them
now in the corresponding boxes.

Setting Up Your Internet Connection
410
• If you’re using AOL: Click the Configure IPv4 pop-up menu and choose
AOL Dialup. If AOL provided you with DNS Server or Search Domain
addresses, click in the corresponding box and type them now.
• If you’re using a manual connection: Click the Configure IPv4 pop-up
menu and choose Manually. Then click in the IP Address, DNS Servers,
and Search Domains fields and enter the respective settings provided
by your ISP.
4. Click the PPP tab.
5. In their respective fields, enter the account name, password, tele-
phone number, and (optionally) the service provider name and an
alternate telephone number provided by your ISP.
6. Press Ô+Q to exit System Preferences and save your changes.
In Book V, Chapter 1, I discuss these Internet settings in depth.
Using Ethernet hardware
Follow these steps to set up your Internet connection if you’re using a net-
work, cable modem, or DSL connection:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock and choose Network.
2. Select Built-in Ethernet from the list on the left of the pane to display
the settings that you see in Figure 1-1.
3. Enter the settings for the type of connection that your ISP provides:

• If your ISP tells you to use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP):
Choose Using DHCP from the Configure pop-up menu, and your ISP
can automatically set up virtually all the TCP/IP settings for you! (No
wonder DHCP is so popular these days.)
• If you won’t be using DHCP: Choose Manually from the Configure pop-
up menu. Then enter the settings provided by your ISP in the IP
Address, Subnet Mask, Router, and DNS Servers fields.
4. If your ISP uses PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet), click
the Configure pop-up menu and choose Create PPPoE Service.
5. Type an indentifying name for the PPPoE service.
6. Click Done.
7. Enter the password for your PPPoE connection.
8. Press Ô+Q to exit System Preferences and save your changes.
If you need help entering Internet settings or you want to know more about
what you’re actually doing with your Ethernet connection, I discuss these
settings in depth in Book V, Chapter 1.
Leopard can get down-and-dirty in the configuration trenches as well! To
launch a wizard to help with the configuration process, click the Assist me
button, and then click Assistant on the wizard welcome screen.
Connecting with a Dialup ISP (The Hard Way)
Before you leave the serene confines of this chapter, I’d like to demonstrate
how to use the Internet Connect application to connect to your ISP via a
dialup modem. (As I mention earlier in this chapter, most connections made
over a network, DSL line, or cable modem won’t need to use Internet
Connect.) You can also use this application to connect if you’re using a 
DSL line with PPPoE or an AirPort connection.
Many ISPs that provide high-speed access for Macs offer PPPoE, which pro-
vides more efficient communications than the older PPP protocol that you
might have used in the past. Further, if you’re using an AirPort wireless con-
nection, you can launch Internet Connect to take advantage of an existing
Internet connection available through your wireless network.
To be honest, I always like Mac OS X to connect automatically when I’m
using a modem. I hate excess mouse movements, which usually lead to a bad
case of Rodent Elbow. To automate your connection, follow these steps:

Connecting with a Dialup ISP (The Hard Way)
412
1. Re-open the Network settings in System Preferences and choose
Internal Modem or External Modem from the list on the left of the
pane.
2. Click the Configure pop-up menu and choose Create PPP Service, then
enable the Connect Automatically When Needed check box.
3. Click OK.
4. Press Ô+Q to exit System Preferences.
You can forget about using Internet Connect!
Follow these steps to connect to the Internet manually, using the aforemen-
tioned (and perfectly useful) Internet Connect application:
1. Open your Applications folder, launch the Internet Connect applica-
tion, and click the Modem toolbar button, which displays the Modem
dialog.
2. From the Configuration pop-up menu, choose Modem Configuration,
Built-in Ethernet (for a DSL PPPoE connection), or AirPort.
3. Select the connection options for the hardware that you’re using:
• Modem connection: Type the telephone number provided by your ISP
into the Telephone Number text box and then type your password in
the Password box (if prompted). I recommend that you enable the
Show Modem Status in Menu Bar check box, too.
• PPPoE connection: Type your password in the Password text box (if
prompted).
• AirPort connection: If you have an AirPort/AirPort Extreme card
installed, click the Turn AirPort On button (if AirPort is currently
powered off) and select the network that provides your Internet
access from the Network pop-up menu.
4. Click the Connect button, sit back, and watch the fun!
You don’t have to click the Connect button if your AirPort (or AirPort
Extreme) Base Station is already connected to your ISP.

O
kay, how many of you can function without e-mail? Raise your hands.
Anyone? Anyone at all?
I suppose that I can function without my Internet e-mail, but why should I?
Mac OS X includes a very capable and reliable e-mail client, Apple Mail
(affectionately called Mail by everyone but Bill Gates).
In this chapter, I discuss the features of Apple Mail and show you how
everything hums at a perfect C pitch. However, you have to sing out, “You’ve
got mail!” yourself. Personally, I think that’s a plus, but I show you how you
can add any sound that you like.
Know Thy Mail Window
To begin our epic e-mail journey, click the Mail icon on the Dock. Figure 2-1
illustrates the Mail window. Besides the familiar toolbar, which naturally car-
ries buttons specific to Mail, you find the following:
✦Status bar: This heading bar at the top of the Mail window displays
information about the current folder — typically, how many messages it
contains, but other data can be included as well.
✦Message list: This resizable scrolling list box contains all the messages
for the folder that you’ve chosen. To resize the list larger or smaller,
drag the handle on the bar that runs across the window. You can also
resize the columns in the list by dragging the edges of the column head-
ing buttons.

Know Thy Mail Window
414
To specify which columns appear in the message list, choose View➪
Columns. From the submenu that appears, you can toggle the display 
of specific columns. You can also sort the messages in the message 
list from the View menu; by default, messages are sorted by the Date
Received. (Alternatively, use Lazy Mark’s method: Just click the column
that you want to sort by.)
✦Mailboxes: The column at the left of the main Mail window is the
Mailboxes list. You can click any of the folders to switch the display 
in the message list. The Mailbox list can be hidden or shown from the
View menu by clicking the Show Mailboxes item, or you can press the
Ô+Shift+M keyboard shortcut to hide or show it.
✦Preview box: This resizable scrolling list box displays the contents of
the selected message, including both text and any graphics or attach-
ments that Mail recognizes.
Mail uses the following folders (some of which appear only at certain times):
✦Inbox: Mail you’ve received already.
✦Outbox: Messages that Mail is waiting to send.
Figure 2-1:

Mail
window.

Book IV
Chapter 2
Using Apple Mail
Know Thy Mail Window
415
✦Drafts: Draft messages waiting to be completed.
✦Sent: Mail you’ve sent already.
✦Trash: Deleted mail. Like the Trash in the Dock, you can open this folder
and retrieve items that you realize you still need. Alternatively, you can
empty the contents of the Trash at any time by pressing the Ô+K short-
cut or by choosing Mailbox➪Erase Deleted Messages.
✦Junk: Junk mail. You can review these messages or retrieve anything
you want to keep by choosing Message➪Move To. After you’re sure
nothing of value is left, you can delete the remaining messages straight
to the Trash. (Junk mail filtering must be enabled from the Junk Mail set-
tings in Preferences before you see this box.)
✦Notes: This folder displays notes that you’ve made — I discuss how to
create a new note later in the chapter.
✦To Do: Ah, don’t forget those all-important reminders about washing the
car, paying taxes, and picking up dog food on the way home. The To Do
folder displays your To Do items, which I cover later in the chapter.
What’s a smart mailbox?
Remember the smart folders you can create in
the Finder? Well, Apple Mail provides some-
thing similar for your e-mail messages: the
smart mailbox. The contents of a smart mailbox
are actually links to messages and To Do items
in your Mail folders; these links match the
search criteria you specify, such as messages
from a specific address or those that contain
attachments. Other criteria include the date an
item is received, the subject of a message, the
mailbox a message is stored in, and so on. You
can use smart mailboxes to organize your mes-
sages and To Do items in different ways and
identify those messages that require special (or
immediate!) attention.
To set up a smart mailbox, choose Mailbox➪
New Smart Mailbox. Type a name to identify the
mailbox and then click the Contains pop-up
menu to choose either messages or To Do
items. Click the Match pop-up menu to specify
whether the search should match any one or all
of your criteria. Now you can click the pop-up
menus to specify what the search should 
find — to add a new criterion line, click the
button with the plus sign. (To delete a criterion
line that Should Not Be, click the button with
the minus sign next to the offending line.) Note
that you can also include messages from Mail’s
Trash and Sent folders. When you’re ready,
click OK, and the new smart mailbox appears in
the Mailboxes list . . . it has a cool folder icon
with a gear symbol, much like a smart folder in
a Finder window.
If you’ve set up your smart folder, it automati-
cally maintains itself when you receive, send,
and delete messages and To Do items, always
showing whatever matches your criteria. Here’s
a mind-boggler . . . imagine what Ben Franklin
could’ve been capable of if he’d been able to
use smart folders!

Setting Up Your Account
416
You can add new personal folders to the Mailbox list to further organize your
messages. Choose Mailbox➪New Mailbox and then type the name for your
new folder in the Name box. Click OK to create the new personal folder.
Messages can be dragged from the message list and dropped into the
desired folder in the Mailbox list to transfer them. Alternatively, you can
move ’em from the Message list by selecting the messages that you want to
move, choosing Message➪Move To, and then clicking the desired destina-
tion folder.
Also note that Spotlight has staked its claim with the Search box at the
upper right in the Mail toolbar.
Setting Up Your Account
By default, Mail includes one (or more) of these accounts when you first run it:
✦The account that you entered when you first installed Mac OS X: Go to
the beginning — literally, Book I, Chapter 1 — to read about the first use
wizard that I discuss at the beginning of this book. If you entered the
information for an e-mail account, it’s available.
✦Your .Mac account: If you registered for a .Mac service account, it’s
included.
✦Upgraded accounts: If you upgraded an existing Mac OS system, your
existing Mail accounts are added to the Accounts list in Mail.
Speaking of the Accounts list, choose Mail➪Preferences and click the
Accounts button to display the Accounts dialog that you see in Figure 2-2.
From here, you can add an account, edit an existing account, or remove an
account from Mail. Although most folks still have only one e-mail account,
you can use a passel of them. For example, you might use one account for
your personal e-mail and one account for your business communications. To
switch accounts, just click the account that you want to use from this list to
make it the active account.
Adding an account
To add a new account within Mail, choose File➪Add Account to open an
Accounts wizard that leads you through the process. ’Nuff said.
However, I’m a manual kind of guy — at least, that’s what I’m told — so I
should describe the process. For our demonstration, I’ll add a typical ISP
POP account from the Preferences dialog, which displays the same Accounts
wizard.

Using Apple Mail
Setting Up Your Account
417
Open the Preferences dialog by clicking Mail and choosing Preferences; then
click the Accounts button on the Preferences toolbar. Follow these steps:
1. Click the Add button at the bottom-left corner of the window, which
carries a plus sign.
2. On the General Information panel, type your full name in the Full
Name field — or, if this is to be an anonymous account, enter what-
ever you like as your identity — and then press Tab.
Messages that you send appear with this name in the From field in the
recipient’s e-mail application.
3. Type the e-mail address assigned to you by your ISP.
4. In the Password field, type the password supplied by your ISP for
login to your e-mail account.
5. Click Continue.
6. Click the Account Type pop-up menu and choose the protocol type to
use for the account.
You can select an Apple .Mac account, a Post Office Protocol (POP)
account, a Microsoft Exchange account, or an Internet Message Access

Protocol (IMAP) account. If you’re adding an account from an Internet
service provider (ISP), refer to the set-up information that you received
to determine which is right. Most ISP accounts are POP accounts.
When you select an Account Type, the fields may change on the Accounts
wizard, but they’ll still follow the same general order I give in this POP
account demonstration. (In fact, there are fewer fields to fill out for IMAP
and .Mac accounts!) Keep the account information provided by your ISP
handy because that data should include everything covered in the wizard.
7. In the Description field, name the account to identify it within Mail
and then press Tab to move to the next field.
For example, Work or Mom’s ISP are good choices.
8. In the Incoming Mail Server text box, type the incoming mail server
address supplied by your ISP.
If your ISP requires a login for security, you’ll need to enter your server
username and password.
9. Click Continue.
10. On the Incoming Mail Security sheet, click the Authentication pop-up
menu and choose the authentication scheme used by your incoming
mail server.
Unless you’re told differently by your ISP, the default choice — 
Password — is very likely correct already.
11. Click Continue.
12. On the Outgoing Mail Server sheet, type a description for the server
and press Tab.
I typically enter the ISP name.
13. In the Outcoming Mail Server text box, type the incoming mail server
address supplied by your ISP.
14. If your ISP requires your e-mail application to authenticate the con-
nection, click the Use Authentication check box to enable it and type
the username and password supplied by your ISP into the correspon-
ding fields.
15. Click Continue on the Account Summary sheet.
16. Click Done on the Conclusion sheet.
You’re done! The new account appears in the Accounts list.
You can specify advanced settings for an account. I cover those in the sec-
tion, “Fine-Tuning Your Post Office,” later in this chapter.

Editing an existing account
Need to make changes to an existing account? Choose Mail➪Preferences and
click the account that you want to change. Mail displays the same settings
that I explain in the preceding section.
Deleting an account
If you change ISPs or you decide to drop an e-mail account, you can remove
it from your Accounts list. Otherwise, Mail can annoy you with error mes-
sages when it can no longer connect to the server for that account. Display
the Mail Preferences window, select the account that you want to delete, and
then click the Remove button (which is graced by a minus sign).
Naturally, Mail requests confirmation before deleting the folders associated
with that account. Click OK to verify the deletion or click the Cancel button
to prevent accidental catastrophe.
Receiving and Reading E-Mail Wisdom
The heart and soul of Mail — well, at least the heart, anyway — is receiving
and reading stuff from your friends and family. (Later in this chapter, I show
you how to avoid the stuff you get promising free prizes, low mortgage rates,
and improved . . . um . . . performance. This is a family-oriented book so
that’s enough of that.)
After you set up an account (or select an account from the Accounts list), it’s
time to check for mail. Use any of these methods to check for new mail:
✦Click the Get Mail button on the toolbar.
✦Choose Mailbox➪Get All New Mail or press Ô+Shift+N.
✦Choose Mailbox➪Get New Mail and then choose the specific account
to check from the submenu.
This is a great way to check for new mail in another account without
going through the trouble of making it active in the Preferences window.
Mail can also check for new messages automatically — more on this in the
upcoming section, “Checking Mail automatically.”
If you do have new mail in the active account, it appears in the Message list.
As you can see in Figure 2-3, new unread messages appear marked with a
snazzy blue dot in the first column. The number of unread messages is dis-
played next to the Inbox folder icon in the Mailboxes list.

Receiving and Reading E-Mail Wisdom
420
Mail also displays the number of new messages that you’ve received on its
Dock icon. If you’ve hidden the Mail window or sent it to the Dock, you can
perform a quick visual check for new mail just by glancing at the Dock.
Reading and deleting your messages
To read any message in the message list, you can either click the desired
entry (which displays the contents of the message in the preview box) or
you can double-click the entry to open the message in a separate message
window, complete with its own toolbar controls.
To quickly scan your mail, click the first message that you want to view in
the list and then press the down-arrow key when you’re ready to move to the
next message. Mail displays the content of each message in the preview box.
To display the previous message in the list, press the up-arrow key.
Mail also allows you to read your messages grouped within threads. A thread
contains an original message and all related replies, which makes it easy to
follow the flow of an e-mail discussion (without bouncing around within your
Inbox, searching for the next message in the conversation). Choose View➪
Organize by Thread, and the replies in the current folder are all grouped
under the original messages and sorted by date. To expand a thread, click
the original message to select it; then press the right-arrow key (or choose
View➪Expand All Threads). To collapse a thread, select the original message
and press the left-arrow key (or choose View➪Collapse All Threads).

Hey, why not let Mail read you your mail? (That is, if you can drive and listen
to your MacBook speak at the same time!) Simply select one message or a
group of messages and then choose Edit➪Speech➪Start Speaking. Wowsers!
To delete a message from the message list, click the desired entry to select it
and then click the Delete button on the toolbar (or press the Del key). To
delete a message from within a message window, click the Delete button on
the toolbar.
Replying to mail
What? Aunt Harriet sent you a message because she’s forgotten where she
parked her car last night? If you happen to know where her priceless ’78
Pinto is, you can reply to her and save her the trouble of retracing her steps.
If Aunt Harriet isn’t in your Address Book yet, this is a good time to add her.
With the message entry selected in the list, choose Message➪Add Sender to
Address Book or just press the convenient Ô+Y keyboard shortcut. The
person’s name and e-mail address are added automatically to your Address
Book. To add more information in the Address Book, however, you have to
open that application separately. (Read through Book I, Chapter 6 for the
skinny on the Address Book.)
To reply to a message in Mail, follow these steps:
1. To respond to a message from the message list, click the desired mes-
sage entry and then click the Reply button on the toolbar.
To respond to a message that you’ve opened in a message window, click
the Reply button on the toolbar for the message window.
If a message was addressed not just to you but also to a number of dif-
ferent people, you can send your reply to all of them. Instead of clicking
the Reply button, click the Reply All button on the Mail window toolbar.
(This is a great way to quickly facilitate a festive gathering, if you get my
drift.)
Displaying all Mail headers
Mail actually hides the majority of the heading
lines that help identify and route an e-mail mes-
sage to its rightful destination. By default, all
you’ll see is the filtered heading, which includes
only the From, Date, To, and Subject fields. This
is great unless for some reason you need to dis-
play the entire message header in all its arcane
madness. If you do, press Ô+Shift+H. You can
toggle back to the filtered heading by pressing
the same shortcut.

You can also add carbon copies of your message to other new recipi-
ents, expanding the party exponentially; more on carbon copies later in
the section, “Raise the Little Flag: Sending E-Mail.”
Mail opens the Reply window that you see in Figure 2-4. Note that the
address has been added automatically and that the default Subject is Re:
<the original subject>. Mail automatically adds a separator line in the
message body field that reads On <day><date>at<time>, <addressee>
wrote:, followed by the text of the original message; this is done so that
the addressee can remember what the heck he or she wrote in the first
place to get you so happy/sad/angry/indifferent. The original text is
indented and prefaced by a vertical line to set it apart. If you like, you
can click in the Subject line and change the default subject line; other-
wise, the cursor is already sitting on the first line of the text box, so you
can simply start typing your reply.
To choose the text from the original message that you want to include in
a reply, select the desired text in the original message before you click
the Reply button.
2. After you complete typing your reply, you can select text in the mes-
sage body and apply different fonts or formats.
To change your reply’s formatting, click the Fonts button on the mes-
sage window toolbar. From the window that appears, you can choose
the font family, the type size, and formatting (such as italic or bold) for

the selected text. Click the Close button on the Fonts window to con-
tinue. (If you like menus, you can also choose Format from the menu and
make changes from there.)
To apply color to the selected text, click the Colors button on the mes-
sage window toolbar and then click anywhere in the color wheel that
appears to select that color. You can also vary the hue by moving the
slider bar at the right of the Colors window. After you find the color that
expresses your inner passion, click the Close button on the Colors
window to continue.
To create a bulleted list in your reply, click the Lists button in the Reply
window, and Mail thoughtfully prepares your first bullet item for you. Hit
Return to add another bullet item, or you can even click the Lists button
again to create a sub-bullet item. Click outside the bullet formatting to
complete the list.
3. To add an attachment, click the Attach button on the toolbar.
Mail displays a familiar file Open dialog. Navigate to the to-be-attached
file, select it, and click the Open button to add it to the message. (More
on attachments in the upcoming section, “Attachments on Parade.”) If
the recipient is running Windows, make sure the Send Windows-Friendly
Attachments check box is enabled — this results in a slightly larger
e-mail message size, but helps ensure that PC e-mail programs, like
Outlook and Outlook Express, can correctly open your attachments.
4. When you’re ready to send your reply, you have two options. You can
click the Send button to immediately add the message to your Out
folder or you can click the Save as Draft button to store it in your
Drafts folder for later editing.
After a message is moved to the Outbox folder, it’s sent either immedi-
ately or at the next connection time that you specify in Mail Preferences
(more on this in the section, “Checking Mail automatically,” later in the
chapter). However, saving the message to your Drafts folder doesn’t
send it. Read the following section for the skinny on how to send a mes-
sage stored in your Drafts folder.
When you reply to a message, you can also forward your reply to another
person (instead of the original sender). The new addressee receives a mes-
sage containing both the text of the original message that you received and
your reply. To forward a message, click the Forward button on the Mail tool-
bar instead of Reply or Reply to All.
If you don’t want to include the text of the original message in a reply,
choose Mail➪Preferences. Click the Composing button and disable the
Quote the Text of the Original Message check box.

Raise the Little Flag: Sending E-Mail
424
By default, Mail checks your spelling while you type and also underlines any
words that it doesn’t recognize. (Very Microsoftian.) I like this feature, but if
you find it irritating, you can turn it off or set Mail to check the spelling just
once (when you click Send). Just choose Mail➪Preferences, click Composing,
and click the Check Spelling as I Type pop-up menu to choose the desired
option.
Raise the Little Flag: Sending E-Mail
To compose and send a new message to someone else, follow these steps:
1. Click the New button on the Mail toolbar or choose File➪New Message
(or avail yourself of the handy Ô+N keyboard shortcut).
Mail opens the New Message window that you see in Figure 2-5.
Hey, what does MIME mean?
First, a note of explanation about Internet
e-mail. (Don’t worry about notes; you won’t be
tested on this stuff.) Decades back, Internet
e-mail messages were pure text, composed
only of ASCII characters — that means no
fancy fonts, colors, stationery, or text format-
ting. However, as more and more folks started
using e-mail, the clarion call rang forth across
the land for more attractive messages (as well
as attachments, which I cover in the section,
“Attachments on Parade”). Therefore, the
MIME encoding standard was developed. In
case you’re interested, MIME stands for
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions — a
rather cool (and surprisingly understandable)
acronym.
Originally, virtually all e-mail programs recog-
nized MIME, but then the Tower of Babel prin-
ciple kicked in, and now there are actually
multiple versions of MIME. Apple Mail uses the
most common variant of MIME, so most folks
who receive your e-mail can see them in all
their glory (even under Windows).
However, if one of your addressees complains
that he got a message containing unrecogniz-
able gobbledygook and a heading that men-
tions MIME, he’s using an e-mail client
application that either doesn’t support MIME or
supports a different version. (Of course, that
person could have unknowingly turned off
MIME support.) You have two possible solu-
tions: You can ask the addressee to double-
check whether MIME is enabled on his end in
the e-mail application or you can disable MIME
when sending a message to that particular
person. When you’re composing an original
message or a reply, you can use pure text by
choosing Format➪Make Plain Text. (Naturally,
this prevents you from doing anything fancy,
and files that you attach to a plain-text mes-
sage might not be delivered correctly.)

2. Enter the recipient’s (To) address by
• Typing it in directly
• Pasting it in after copying it to the Clipboard
• Dragging an e-mail address from your Address Book
or
• (My favorite) Clicking the Address button, which shows you the
scaled-down version of the Address Book (the Addresses window)
that you see in Figure 2-6
From the Addresses window, click the address that you want to use and
then click the To button. To pick multiple recipients, hold down the Ô
key while you click the multiple addresses. Click the Close button on the
Addresses window to close it and then press Tab.
If you have a huge number of entries in your Address Book, use the
Search field on the Addresses window toolbar, which operates just like
the Finder window Search box.
3. When Mail highlights the Cc field (the spot where you can send
optional carbon copies of the message to additional recipients), you
can type the addresses directly, use the contents of the Clipboard, or
display the Addresses window.
Figure 2-5:

If you use the Addresses window, select the addresses that you want to
use and click the Cc button. Then click the Close button on the
Addresses window and press Tab.
Looking for the Blind Carbon Copy (Bcc) field? To display it, choose
View➪Bcc Address Field. (A blind carbon copy is a message sent to multi-
ple recipients, just like a regular carbon copy, but the recipients aren’t
listed when the message is displayed — that way, the other recipients
don’t know who else got a copy of the message.) You can also click the
small Field Display pop-up menu at the left side of the Subject field to
toggle the display of the Bcc Address Field.
4. In the Subject field, enter the subject of the message and then 
press Tab.
Your text cursor now rests in the first line of the message text box —
type, my friend, type like the wind! It’s considered good form to keep
this line short and relatively to the point.
5. Click the Show Stationery button on the toolbar to display the
Stationary strip above the message text box (as shown in Figure 2-7),
where you can choose one of many backgrounds that Apple supplies.
Figure 2-6:

Stationery isn’t required, but it really packs a visual wallop! Double-click
a thumbnail in the strip to add it to your message; to display a different
category of stationery, like a Greeting or Invitation, click the category
buttons on the left side of the Stationery strip.
This one will really knock your socks off: If you choose a Photo sta-
tionery background for your new message, you can even drag an image
from iPhoto or a Finder window to fill the “placeholder” images on the
background. (Which, when you think about it, kind of makes sense . . .
after all, why send an e-mail from sunny Italy that has stock photos of a
strange couple at the top? Add your own travel shots instead!) Figure 2-7
illustrates a Photo stationery background.
Not all e-mail applications on other computers correctly display a mes-
sage with a stationery background — for the whole scoop, see the side-
bar titled “Hey, what does MIME mean?,” earlier in this chapter. Also,
remember that a message with a stationery background is going to be
much larger than a simple text message, especially if it contains a
number of photos. (And, as you guessed, that also means it takes longer
to send and receive, which is very important for those using a dialup
analog modem connection.)
6. After you type your message, select any of the text that you’ve entered
and use the toolbar features I describe in the earlier section, “Replying
to mail,” to apply different fonts or formatting.

Click the Fonts button in the message window toolbar to open a window
of formatting choices. (Click its Close button to continue.) If you like
menus, you can also click Format and make changes from there.
7. Add color to any selected text, if you like.
Just click the Colors button in the message window toolbar and make
choices there; when the hue is perfect, click the Close button on the
Colors window to continue.
8. To add an attachment, click the Attach button on the toolbar, navigate
to the to-be-attached file in the dialog that appears, select the file, and
then click Open to add it to the message.
9. When your new message is ready to post, either click the Send button
to immediately add the message to your Out folder or click the Save
as Draft button to store it in your Drafts folder (without actually send-
ing it).
To send a message held in your Drafts folder, click the Drafts folder in the
Drawer to display all draft messages. Double-click the message that you
want to send, which displays the message window — you can make edits at
this point, if you like — and then click the Send button on the message
window toolbar.
If you don’t have access to an Internet connection at the moment, Mail
allows you to work off-line. This way, you can read your unread messages
and compose new ones on the road to send later. After you regain your
Internet connection, you might need to choose Mailbox➪Go Online (depend-
ing on the connection type).
What? You Get Junk Mail, Too?
Spam — it’s the Crawling Crud of the Internet, and I hereby send out a life-
time of bad karma to those who spew it. However, chucking the First
Amendment is not an option, so I guess we’ll always have junk mail. (Come
to think of it, my paper mailbox is just as full of the stuff.)
Thankfully, Apple Mail has a net that you can cast to collect junk mail before
you have to read it. The two methods of handling junk mail are
✦Manually: You can mark any message in the message list as Junk Mail.
Select the unwanted flotsam in the message list and then click the Junk
button on the Mail window toolbar, which marks the message, as shown
in Figure 2-8. (Ocean-front property in Kansas . . . yeah, right.) If a mes-
sage is mistakenly marked as junk but you actually want it, display the
message in the preview box and then click the Not Junk button at the
top of the preview box.

Book IV
Chapter 2
Using Apple Mail
What? You Get Junk Mail, Too?
429
✦Automatically: Apple Mail has a sophisticated Junk Mail filter that you
actually train to better recognize what’s junk. (Keep reading to discover
how.) After you train Mail to recognize spam with a high degree of accu-
racy, turn it to full Automatic mode, and it moves all those worthless
messages to your Junk folder.
You customize and train the Junk Mail filter from the Preferences dialog
(available from your trusty Mail menu); click Junk Mail to show the settings.
I recommend that you first try Mail in Training mode, using the When Junk
Mail Arrives, Leave It in My Inbox option. Junk Mail then takes its best shot
at determining what’s junk. When you receive more mail and mark more
messages as junk (or mark them as not junk), you’re actually teaching the
Junk Mail feature how to winnow the wheat from the chaff. In Training mode,
junk messages aren’t actually moved anywhere — they’re just marked with a
particularly fitting, grungy brown color.
After you’re satisfied that the Junk Mail filter is catching just about every-
thing that it can, display the Mail preferences again and choose the Move It
to the Junk Mailbox option. Mail creates a Junk folder and prompts you for
permission to move all junk messages to this folder. After you review every-
thing in the Junk folder, you can delete what it contains and send it to the
Trash folder. To save a message from junkdom, click the Not Junk button in
Figure 2-8:
“Be gone,
sludge
demons of
Junk Mail!”

the preview window and then drag the message from the Junk folder mes-
sage list to the desired folder in the Drawer.
Finally, you can create a complete set of custom rules for your Junk Mail fil-
tering by clicking Perform Custom Actions — the Advanced button displays
your Junk Mail rule set and allows you to edit your rules. I explain rules in
more depth at the end of this chapter.
If you don’t receive a lot of spam — or you want to be absolutely sure that
nothing gets labeled as junk until you review it — click the Enable Junk Mail
Filtering check box to disable it. (And good luck.)
By default, Mail exempts certain messages from Junk Mail status based on
three criteria: if the sender is in your Address Book, if you’ve sent the sender
a message in the past, or if the message is addressed to you with your full
name. To tighten up your Junk Mail filtering to the max, you might want to
disable these check boxes as well.
To reset the Junk Mail filter and erase any training that you’ve done, visit the
Junk Mail settings in Preferences again and click Reset. Then click the Yes
button to confirm your choice.
Attachments on Parade
Attachments are a fun way to transfer files through e-mail. However, it’s
imperative that you remember these three very important caveats:
✦Attachments can contain viruses. Even a message attachment that was
actually sent by your best friend can contain a virus — either because
your friend unwittingly passed one along or because the virus actually
took control of your friend’s e-mail application and replicated itself auto-
matically. (Ugh.)
Is it a Mark’s Maxim, or is it a dire warning? (It’s both!)
Never — I mean never — send or receive attachments unless you have
an up-to-date antivirus scanning application running.™
✦Corpulent attachments don’t make it. Most corporate and ISP mail
servers have a 1–4MB limit for the total size of a message, and the
attachment counts toward that final message size. Therefore, I recom-
mend sending a file as an attachment only if it’s less than 1MB (or per-
haps 2MB) in size. If the recipient’s e-mail server sends you an automated
message saying that the message was refused because it was too big,
this is the problem.

Book IV
Chapter 2
Using Apple Mail
Fine-Tuning Your Post Office
431
✦Not all e-mail applications and firewalls accept attachments. Not all
e-mail programs support attachments in the same way, and others are
simply set for pure text messages. Some corporate firewalls even reject
messages with attachments. If the message recipient gets the message
text but not the attachment, these are the likely reasons.
With that said, it’s back to attachments as a beneficial feature. Follow these
steps to save an attachment that you receive:
1. Click the message with an attachment in your message list.
Having trouble determining which messages have attachments? Choose
View➪Columns and then click the Attachments item from the submenu
that appears to toggle it on. Now messages with attachments appear
with a tiny paper clip icon in the entry.
If Mail recognizes the attachment format, it displays or plays the attach-
ment in the body of the message; if not, the attachment is displayed as a
file icon.
2. To open an attachment that’s displayed as a file icon, click the file
icon and then choose Open Attachment from the pop-up menu that
appears.
If you know what application should be used to open the attachment,
click the Open With button and choose the correct application from the
submenu that appears.
3. To save an attachment, hold down Control, click the attachment (how-
ever it appears in the message), and then choose Save Attachment
from the pop-up menu.
In the Save dialog that appears, navigate to the location where you want
to save the file and then click Save.
Fine-Tuning Your Post Office
Like all other Apple software, Mail is easily customized to your liking. In this
section, I discuss some of the preferences that you might want to change.
Adding sound
To choose a sound that plays whenever you receive new mail, choose Mail➪
Preferences and click the General button. Either click the New Mail Sound
pop-up menu and choose one of the sounds that Apple provides or choose
Add/Remove from the pop-up menu to choose a sound file from the Sounds
folder (which, in turn, is located within your Library folder). Choose None
from the pop-up menu to disable the new mail sound altogether.

Fine-Tuning Your Post Office
432
Checking Mail automatically
By default, Mail automatically checks for new mail (and sends any mail in
your Out folder) every five minutes. To change this delay period, display the
General panel in the Preferences dialog, choose the Check for New Mail pop-
up menu, and then choose one of the time periods. To disable automatic
mail checking, choose Manually; you can click the Get Mail toolbar button to
manually check your mail any time you like. (For example, those folks using
dialup analog modem connections may not fancy Mail taking control of the
telephone line every 5 minutes.)
Automating junk mail and message deletion
If you like, Mail can be set to automatically delete sent mail and Junk 
messages (as well as permanently erase messages that you relegate to 
the Trash). To configure these settings, display the Accounts list in the
Preferences window, click the desired account, and then click the Mailboxes
Behaviors tab.
To delete Sent messages automatically, click the Delete Sent Messages When
pop-up menu and choose the delay period or action. You can choose to
delete mail after a day, a week, a month, or immediately upon quitting Mail.
Alternatively, you can leave this field set to Never, and Mail never automati-
cally deletes any messages from the Sent folder.
To delete Junk messages automatically, click the Delete Junk Messages When
pop-up menu and choose the delay period or action. (They’re the same as
the options available for Sent mail.)
To delete messages from the Trash, click the Permanently Erase Deleted
Messages When pop-up menu and choose the delay period or action —
again, the choices are the same as those for Sent messages.
Adding signatures
To add a block of text or a graphic to the bottom of your messages as your
personal signature, follow these steps:
1. Choose Mail➪Preferences and click the Signatures button.
2. From the Signatures pane that appears, click the Add Signature button
(which carries a plus sign).
3. Click the signature name to open an edit box and then type an identi-
fying name.
Press Return to save the new name.

Book IV
Chapter 2
Using Apple Mail
Automating Your Mail with Rules
433
4. Click inside the text entry box at the right to move the cursor.
5. Type the signature itself in the text entry box or copy the signature to
the Clipboard and paste it into the text entry box.
Because downloading a graphic in a signature takes long — and because
some folks still use plain-text e-mail — avoid the temptation to include
graphics in your signature.
6. If you have multiple signatures, click the Choose Signature pop-up
menu to choose which one you want to use or to use them all ran-
domly or in sequence.
If you prefer the signature to appear above the quoted text in a reply, click
the Place signature above quoted text check box to enable it.
Changing the status of an account
Sometimes you can’t reach one of your accounts. For example, maybe you’re
on the road with your laptop and you can’t access your office network.
Apple Mail allows you to enable and disable specific accounts without the
hassle of deleting an account and then having to add it again.
To disable or enable an account, open the Preferences dialog, click the
Accounts button, click the desired account, click the Advanced tab, and then
enable (or clear) the Enable This Account check box as necessary.
If you disable an account, you should also disable the Include When
Automatically Checking for New Mail check box to make sure that Mail 
doesn’t display an error message. You can always check any account for 
new mail by choosing Mailbox➪Get New Mail and then choosing the desired
account name from the submenu.
Automating Your Mail with Rules
Before I leave the beautiful shores of Mail Island — “GILLIGAN!” — I’d be
remiss if I didn’t discuss one of its most powerful features: the ability to
create rules, which are automated actions that Mail can take. With rules, you
can specify criteria that can perform actions such as
✦Transferring messages from one folder to another
✦Forwarding messages to another address
✦Highlighting or deleting messages

Automating Your Mail with Rules
434
To set up a rule, follow these steps:
1. Choose Mail➪Preferences and then click the Rules button on the 
toolbar.
Mail displays the Rules dialog.
2. To duplicate an existing rule, highlight it in the list and then click the
Duplicate button. (For this demonstration, however, create a rule from
scratch by clicking the Add Rule button.)
3. In the Description field, type a descriptive name for the new rule and
then press Tab to move to the next field.
4. Click the If pop-up menu to specify whether the rule is triggered if any
of the conditions are met or if all conditions must be met.
5. Because each rule requires at least one condition, click the target pop-
up menus to see the target for the condition.
These include whom the message is from or to, which account received
the message, whether the message is marked as junk, and whether the
message contains certain content. Select the target for the condition.
6. Click the Criteria pop-up menu to choose the rule’s criteria.
The contents of this pop-up menu change depending on the condition’s
target. For example, if you choose From as the target, the criteria include
Contains, Does Not Contain, Begins With, and so forth.
7. Click in the expression box and type the text to use for the condition.
For example, a completed condition might read
Subject Contains Ocean-Front
This particular condition is true if I get an e-mail message with a subject
that contains the string Ocean-Front.
8. Add more conditions by clicking the plus sign button at the right of
the first condition.
To remove any condition from this rule, click the minus sign button next
to it. Remember, however, that every rule needs at least one condition.
9. To specify what action is taken after the condition (or conditions) is
met, click the first Perform the Following Actions pop-up menu to see
the action that this rule should perform. Then click the second pop-up
menu and select the action for the rule.
Choices include transferring a message from one folder to another, play-
ing a sound, automatically forwarding the message, deleting it, and
marking it as read.

Book IV
Chapter 2
Using Apple Mail
Automating Your Mail with Rules
435
Each rule requires at least one action.
10. Depending on the action that you select, specify one or more criteria
for the action.
For instance, if I select Set Color as my action, I must then choose
whether to color the text or the background as well as what color to use.
Like the plus button next to the conditions, you can also click the plus
button next to the first action to perform more than one action. To
remove an action, click the minus button next to it.
11. When the rule is complete, click OK to save it.
Here’s an example of a complex rule:
If the message was sent by someone in my Address Book and the Subject
field contains the text FORWARD ME, forward the message to the e-mail
address fuadramses@mac.com.
This is a good example of an automated forwarding rule. With this rule in
place and Mail running on Mac OS X, any of my friends, family, or co-workers
can forward urgent e-mail to my .Mac account while I’m on vacation. To trig-
ger the rule, all the sender has to do is include the words FORWARD ME in the
message subject. And if the sender isn’t in my Address Book, the rule doesn’t
trigger, and I can read the message when I get home. Mondo sassy.
Each rule in the Rules dialog can be enabled or disabled by toggling the
Active check box next to the rule. You can also edit a rule by selecting it in
the Rules dialog and then clicking the Edit button. To delete a rule com-
pletely from the list, select it and then click the Remove button; Mail prompts
you for confirmation before the deed is done.
If you decide to create a custom Junk mail processing rule, the process is the
same, but you get to it from a different place. Click the Junk Mail button on
the Preferences dialog and click the Perform Custom Actions radio button to
select it. You see that the Advanced button is now enabled — click it and
you can set up the custom Junk mail rules that handle stuff from any con-
ceivable junk mail source!

T
hroughout man’s history, our drive has been toward communication —
from the earliest cave paintings, through written language, to the tele-
graph, the telephone, and the cell phone all-in-one PDA that the guy in the
SUV in front of you is using . . . and he’s arguing with someone and he’s not
paying attention and . . . (whump).
So much for the scholarly introduction — forget that silly cellular phone and
your complicated calling plan! As long as you have Mac OS X and an Internet
connection, you can instantly chat with your friends and family whether
they’re across the aisle in another cube or halfway across the world. And,
by golly, if you both have an iSight camera, Web camera, or digital video
(DV) camcorder connected to your computers, you’ll see each other in glori-
ous, full-color video! This modern marvel is iChat, and it fulfills the decades-
old promise of the video telephone quite well, thank you.
In this chapter, I show you how to gab with the following folks:
✦Others who use iChat (either on your local network or on the Internet)
✦Anyone who uses AIM — that’s short for America Online (AOL) 
Instant Messaging
✦Folks who participate in AOL chat rooms

Configuring iChat
438
Configuring iChat
When you first run iChat (by clicking the iChat icon in the Dock), you’re
prompted to create an iChat account. Type the first name (your name) that
you want to use in the First Name field, press Tab, and then type the sur-
name that you want to use. (Yes, you can even use Bullwinkle Moose — just
leave out the middle initial J.)
By default, iChat uses the .Mac account that you set up when you first
installed Mac OS X. In this case, your .Mac account name and password are
entered automatically for you, and you’re good to go. However, if you’re
already using AIM and you want to use your existing AIM account, click the
Account Type pop-up menu and choose AIM; then enter your AIM name and
password instead.
iChat will also set up Bonjour messaging automatically. Think of Bonjour as
plug-and-play for your local network. In iChat, Bonjour messaging displays a
separate window where you can see (and yak with) anyone on your local
network without having to know his iChat name. That’s because Bonjour
automatically announces all the iChat users who are available on your net-
work. If you have others using iChat or AIM on your local network, go for
this option; if you’re not connected to a local network, however, Bonjour
messaging isn’t necessary. Also, if you’re on a public AirPort/AirPort
Extreme network or if you’re connecting to the Internet with a modem
through dialup, I recommend disabling Bonjour messaging. (For all that’s
cool about AirPort and its faster sibling AirPort Extreme, see Book V,
Chapter 4.)
After you finish these configuration necessities, iChat displays the Buddy
List window (or, if you’re using Bonjour messaging, two windows) that you
see in Figure 3-1. Remember that your Bonjour window displays only those
iChat folks on your local network.
A few things to note here about the Buddy List window:
✦If you don’t like your picture, don’t panic. By default, iChat uses your
user account thumbnail image as your visual persona. However, you can
add a picture to your iChat iDentity — sorry, I couldn’t resist that — by
dragging an image to the well next to your name at the top of the Buddy
List window. If necessary, iChat asks you to position and size the image
so that it fits in the (admittedly limited) space. This picture is then sent
along with your words when you chat. In the figures for this chapter, I
borrow the smiling face of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

Click your image to display your recent thumbnails. This way, you can
even use a different thumbnail image for each of your many moods.
(Geez.) Also, you can click Edit Picture from the pop-up menu and cap-
ture a new thumbnail with your iSight camera.
✦Check out the buttons along the bottom of the Buddy List window. In
order, these buttons are
• Add a New Buddy (which I cover in the following section)
• Start a Text Chat (plain, old-fashioned chatting via the keyboard)
• Start an Audio Chat (chatting with your voice, using microphones)
• Start a Video Chat (the ultimate chat, where the parties can both see
and hear each other)
• Start Screen Sharing (where you can view — or even remotely 
control — a buddy’s computer)

Using these buttons can handle about 90 percent of the commands that
you need to give while using iChat, so use ’em! (Note that the Bonjour
window doesn’t have an Add a New Buddy button because the Buddy
List in the Bonjour window is populated automatically by other iChat
folks on your local network.)
✦Hey, look, there’s an iChat menu bar icon! When you’re running iChat,
you can choose to add a balloon menu bar icon in the upper-right corner
of your screen. Click it to display the options that you see in Figure 3-2.
You can change your online/offline status, immediately invite a Buddy for
a chat, or display the Buddy List (which I discuss later in the section, “Will
You Be My Buddy?”). The menu bar icon appears only if you enable the
Show Status in Menu Bar check box. Click iChat in the menu and choose
Preferences; then click the General button in the Preference dialog.
Changing Modes in iChat
To launch iChat, you can click its icon from the Dock or launch it from its iChat
application icon (which you find in your Applications folder). Or, you can click
its menu bar icon, which is grayed out when you’re offline. If you’re not already
familiar with the terms online and offline, here’s the scoop: When you’re online,
folks can invite you to chat and communicate with you. When you’re offline,
you’re disconnected: iChat isn’t active, you can’t be paged, and you can’t chat.
Figure 3-2:
The iChat

Book IV
Chapter 3

with iChat
Will You Be My Buddy?
441
Even when you’re offline, you can choose Available from the friendly balloon
Finder menu bar icon, which automatically switches iChat to online mode.
Or you can click a Buddy name directly, which automatically switches iChat
to online mode and opens the paging window for that Buddy. (Naturally, you
have to have the proper network or Internet connection first.)
You can use another mode, Away, whenever iChat is running and you’re still
online but not available. For example, if I’m away from my Mac for a few min-
utes, I leave iChat running but I switch myself to Away mode. My Buddies get
a message saying that I’m Away, so they won’t bother trying to contact me.
When I return to my computer, I simply move my mouse, and iChat intelli-
gently inquires as to whether I’d like to return to Available mode. You can
also use the menu bar icon to switch from Away to Available (or my other
favorite mode, Twiddling My Thumbs). Refer to Figure 3-2 to see these
choices.
iChat can even display the iTunes song you’re listening to at the moment . . .
pick Current iTunes Song from the menu and impress your friends with your
digital audio technopowers.
Speaking of modes, you, too, can create a custom mode — like Bored stiff! or
Listening to the Pointy-Haired Boss — and use it instead of the somewhat
mundane choices of Available and Away. To do this, display the Buddy List
window, click the word Available beneath your name (refer to Figure 3-2),
and a pop-up menu appears. Click Custom Available or Custom Away to
create your new mode. An edit box appears, where you can type the new
mode; press Return to automatically add the newcomer to your mode list.
You can also switch modes from this pop-up menu.
To choose an existing mode, click it; modes with a green bullet are online
modes, and red bullet modes are offline modes. (Apple provides you with
some starting choices, like Surfing the Web for Available and In a Meeting for
Away.) Notice in Figure 3-2 that I created a custom mode called Getting
Another Diet Coke . . . cAfFeInE fills my life.
Will You Be My Buddy?
I know that question sounds a little personal, but in iChat, a Buddy is anyone
whom you want to chat with, whether the topic is work related or your per-
sonal life. iChat keeps track of your Buddies in the Buddy List. You can also
add them to your Address Book or use the AIM entry in an Address Book
contact to generate a new Buddy identity.

Will You Be My Buddy?
442
To add a new Buddy, follow these steps:
1. Choose Buddies➪Add Buddy, or click the Add Buddy button at the
bottom of the iChat window and click Add Buddy from the pop-up
menu, or press Ô+Shift+A.
2. To create a Buddy entry from an Address Book contact who has an
Instant Messaging username, click the down arrow button next to the
Last Name box to display the Address Book list. Click the entry to
select it.
As a shortcut, you can also click in the First Name box and then type the
person’s first name, or click in the Account Name box and type the
person’s Instant Messaging account name.
3. To add a brand-new person who’s not already in your Address Book,
type the person’s Instant Messaging account name and click the pop-
up menu to select the proper account type (either .Mac or AIM).
4. Click Add to save the Buddy information.
Even when you add a new Buddy and that name appears in the Buddy List,
don’t be surprised if the name actually fades out after a few seconds — that
indicates that the person is offline and unavailable. You can also tell when a
person is available if her name appears with a green bullet in the Buddy List.
You can also specify a number of actions that iChat should take if a Buddy
logs in or out of Instant Messaging, or if a Buddy changes his or her status to
Available. To display these actions, click the desired Buddy’s entry in your
Buddy List and then press Ô+Shift+I. Click the Actions button and then
choose the event that should trigger the action from the Event pop-up menu.
Enable the desired check box to specify whether iChat should play the
sound that you select, run an AppleScript, and/or bounce the iChat icon on
the Dock.
Click the Address Card button on the Info dialog to enter or edit the person’s
✦Real name
✦Nickname
✦E-mail
✦Buddy icon
iChat obligingly creates an entry in your Address Book for your new Buddy.

Chat! Chat, I Say!
443
Chat! Chat, I Say!
Turn your attention to getting the attention of others — through inviting
others to chat. Good chatting etiquette implies inviting someone to a conver-
sation rather than barging in unannounced.
If you want to join an AIM chat already in progress, choose File➪Go to Chat
Room (or press Ô+Ctrl+G). Depending on the service being used, you might
have to specify both the type of chat and the specific chat room name.
At this point, it’s time to draw your attention to the green phone and video
icons next to each person in your Buddy List (as well as next to your own
name at the top of the list). If the green phone icon appears next to both
your name and your buddy’s name, you can enjoy a two-way audio (or
voice) chat. If both you and your buddy (or buddies) are lucky enough to
have iSight or DV cameras connected to your Macs, you can jump into a real-
time, two-way video chat room, complete with audio. Time for a very impor-
tant Mark’s Maxim that’s violated a surprising number of times:
Always wear a shirt while chatting with video, no matter your impressive
physique. Always.™
If your Mac has a microphone or video camera hooked up but you don’t see
these icons, click the Video menu and make sure that the Microphone
Enabled and Camera Enabled menu items are selected.
To invite someone, click the desired Buddy from the Buddy List, click
Buddies, and then choose Invite to Chat. (If your pointing thing has two but-
tons, right-click — or Control-click — the Buddy in the list and click Invite to
Chat.) You can also click directly on the phone or camera icon next to the
person’s name in your Buddy List. iChat displays the Group Chat window
that you see in Figure 3-3, which also doubles as an Invitation window.
You can invite additional Buddies to enter the chat by clicking the plus
button at the bottom left of the Participants list and choosing another
Buddy. If the Participants list isn’t visible, click the View menu and choose
Show Chat Participants.
Type your invitation text into the entry box at the bottom of the window. 
If you want to use bold or italic text, highlight the text and press Ô+B for
Bold (B) or Ô+I for Italic (I). You can also add a Smiley face to your invitation
text: Click in the desired spot in the text, click the Smiley button to the right
of the text entry field, and then choose the proper Smiley from the list. To
send the invitation text, press Return.

Chat! Chat, I Say!
444
The recipient of your chat invitation can decline or accept your chat invita-
tion. You’re notified (as delicately as possible) if the chat has been declined.
To invite a Buddy to an audio chat, select that person in the Buddy List, click
the Buddies menu, and then choose Invite to Audio Chat (or One-Way Audio
Chat, if only one of you has a microphone). A video invitation works in a sim-
ilar fashion: Click Buddies and choose either Invite to Video Chat or Invite to
One-Way Video Chat, depending on the hardware available. (Need I mention
you can just right-click or Control-click the person in your Buddy list and
choose these commands from the pop-up menu that appears.)
If the chat is accepted, iChat displays a message saying that the Buddy
whom you invited has joined the chat, and you now can begin the chat. You
don’t have to alternate sending messages back and forth between partici-
pants — everyone in a chat can compose and send messages at the same
time — but I personally like to alternate when I’m chatting one-on-one. By
the way, you might notice that AIM users are represented by the AIM
Running Dude icon (unless AOL changes it, or you assign an icon picture of
your own, as I describe in the preceding section).

Chat! Chat, I Say!
445
If someone invites you to a chat, you get the opposite side of the coin: 
A prompt dialog appears, and you can choose to accept or decline the 
invitation. (If it’s a video chat, you even get a video preview of the person
inviting you.)
You can resize the Chat window by using the handle at the bottom-right
corner, just like most other application windows in Mac OS X.
You can also change fonts and colors while composing a line of text. Simply
select the text and then choose Format➪Show Fonts or Format➪Show Colors
(or press Ô+T or Ô+Shift+C) to display the Fonts and Colors windows,
respectively. These windows can be resized and moved wherever you like.
To save the discussion in a chat, choose File➪Save a Copy As. In the dialog
that appears, type a name for the chat file, select a location where you want
to store the file, and then click Save. To automatically save transcripts of all
your chats, choose iChat➪Preferences and click Messages; then select the
Automatically Save Chat Transcripts To check box. By default, the tran-
scripts are saved in an iChat folder that’s created inside your Documents
folder in your Home folder. You can, however, click the pop-up menu to
choose another location if you like.
When the iChat window is active, a number of display choices can be made
from the View menu. Click the Messages item in the View menu to display
these options, including
✦Show as Text: Each line that you write and receive in a chat can be 
displayed in balloons, just like your favorite comic — the default — or 
as simple text. You can also choose to display text lines in the more 
traditional boxes, or as compact text (allowing more room for more
characters in the iChat window).
Sending SMS messages and e-mail within iChat
iChat doesn’t limit you to just a chat between
computers! Choose File➪Send SMS and you
can hold an SMS (Short Message Service) con-
versation with anyone using a digital mobile
phone. iChat prompts you for the mobile phone
number, and the connection is made automati-
cally. The SMS chat window looks just like the
standard iChat text chat window. (Need I warn
you that the charge for text messaging can
bankrupt an unsuspecting teenager in an
hour?)
You can also choose to ship off an e-mail mes-
sage from within iChat — click a person in the
Buddy list and click the Buddies menu; then
click Send Email to automatically launch Apple
Mail.

Sharing Screens and iChat Theater
446
✦Show Names and Pictures: Each line can be displayed with the individ-
ual’s picture, just the name, or both the name and picture.
If you’re tired of the default background for the chat window, click View and
choose the Set Chat Background menu item to choose a graphic to use for
the Chat window. To return to the original appearance, choose the Clear
Background menu item.
Click the Buddy List, and the View menu offers a different set of controls:
You can sort your Buddy List by first name, last name, or availability; and
you can also toggle the display of offline Buddies. These options are also
available from the Buddy List toolbar.
Curious about the capabilities of your Mac hardware in iChat? Choose
Video➪Connection Doctor, where you can view statistics and information
about your current chat, display the features of iChat that are supported by
your Mac, and view any error messages that are generated by iChat during
this session.
To close a chat, click the Close button on the Chat window.
Sharing Screens and iChat Theater
How often have you wanted to show someone a neat new application, or
lead your Aunt Mildred through the paces of setting up an Apple TV connec-
tion on her system? That’s the idea behind the ultimate collaboration tool,
sharing screens, where you can watch (or even remotely control) the display
on another person’s Mac — across any broadband Internet or local network
connection!
Screen sharing must be turned on for you to send or receive sharing invites.
Choose Video➪Screen Sharing Enabled — a check mark appears next to the
menu item when the feature is enabled.
If a buddy invites you to share a screen, you receive a prompt where you can
accept or decline — accept the sharing invitation, and iChat automatically
initiates an audio chat (so that you can gab away to each other while things
are happening onscreen). Suddenly, you’re seeing the Desktop and applica-
tions that your buddy is running, and you can both control the cursor and
left/right click the mouse.
Throughout the screen-sharing session, iChat maintains a semi-opaque panel
on your screen that has three buttons:
✦End the Shared Screen Session: Click this button to exit shared screen
mode.

Book IV
Chapter 3
Staying in Touch
with iChat
Sending Files with iChat
447
✦Switch Desktops: Click this button to swap between your Mac’s screen
and the remote Mac’s screen. (Those Mac owners who have enabled
Fast User Switching will recognize the cool screen swap animation.)
✦Mute Audio: Click this button to mute the audio during the screen-
sharing session.
To invite a buddy to share your screen, choose Buddies➪Share My Screen.
Okay, if sharing a screen with someone you don’t absolutely know and trust
doesn’t set off alarm bells in your cranium, it should. Remember, anyone
with shared screen access can perform most of the same actions that you
can do, just as if that person was sitting in front of your Mac — granted,
most of the truly devastating things would require you to type your admin
password, but a malicious individual could still delete files or wreak havoc
any number of ways on your system. Be careful with whom you share your
screen!
But wait . . . what if you don’t want to control Aunt Mildred’s Mac? Perhaps
you just want to share a document instead? For example, you could show off
some photos, or a movie you’ve just finished. That’s the idea behind iChat
Theater, where you can share a document or video and hold a conversation
while viewing the content! iChat Theater falls in-between Screen Sharing and
a simple file download, which I’ll cover in the next section.
To select one or more items for your Theater show, choose Video➪Share
with iChat Theater. iChat displays a standard Open dialog, where you can
select one or more items. When you’re ready to begin your Theater presenta-
tion, click Share. If you’re using a video camera, your video appears as a
thumbnail, while your content gets center stage.
iChat Theater works with anything that can be displayed in Quick Look,
including slide shows from iPhoto, a Keynote presentation, or a QuickTime
movie.
Sending Files with iChat
To send a file to a Buddy, click the desired entry in the Buddy List and then
choose Buddies➪Send a File. Alternatively, you can use the Ô+Option+F key-
board shortcut; right-click and choose Send a File; drag the file from a Finder
window to the person’s entry in the Buddy List; or even drag the file into the
text typing window. (How’s that for convenience?) A dialog appears to indi-
cate that the recipient is being offered a file transfer request. If the file
request is accepted by your Buddy, the transfer begins and is saved where
the recipient specifies on her system.

Eliminating the Riffraff
448
If a Buddy sends you a file, the Incoming File Request pane appears. You can
then either click the Decline button (to decline the file transfer) or the Save
File button (to save the incoming file to any spot on your system).
Always check any files that you receive from iChat with your antivirus scan-
ning software before you run them!
Eliminating the Riffraff
Here I need to explain something that I hope you won’t have to use — what I
like to call the Turkey Filter. (iChat is a little more subtle — you just ignore
people.)
To ignore someone in a chat group, click her name in the list and choose
Buddies➪Ignore <person>. When someone is ignored in a chat group, you
don’t see anything that she types or have to respond to any file transfer
requests from that person.
If only it were that easy to ignore someone when he’s standing close to you.
Anyway, if the person becomes a royal pain, you can also choose to block
that person entirely. That way, the offensive cur doesn’t even know that
you’re online, and he can’t reach you at all. Click the person in the list and
choose Buddies➪Block <person> — the deal is done.
Adding Visual Effects
Our esteemed Apple software developers decided to bring a little Hollywood
special effects “flash” to iChat with the introduction of Leopard’s new video
backdrops. You can also use many of the special effects filters provided by
Photo Booth to keep your video chat room laughing!
To add a video backdrop to your video feed, choose Video➪Video Preview to
display your stunning self in a live video feed, then choose Video➪Show
Video Preview. Use the scroll buttons to move to the backdrop thumbnails
toward the end of the effects library — when you click on one, iChat
prompts you to leave the frame for a few seconds, so that the plain back-
ground behind you can be correctly “masked” (just like those blockbuster
special effects used in today’s films). When your background has been cap-
tured and masked, iChat prompts you to return to your spot, and you’ll see
that your new static or animated backdrop is in place. Just plain cool!
The plainer the background behind you, the better iChat can process and
mask your background. A plain wall painted a single color works best.

Book IV
Chapter 3

449
“But Mark, I want my own movies and photos for backgrounds!” No problem —
you’ll notice that iChat provides six user-defined backdrop slots for your own
selections at the end of the Video Effects collection. (Click the right scroll
arrow in the Video Effects window until you reach the last couple of pages.) To
add your own visuals, you can:
✦Drag a video from iMovie to an empty User Backdrop well in the Video
Effects window.
✦Drag a photo from iPhoto to an empty User Backdrop well in the Video
Effects window.
✦Drag a video or photo from a Finder window to an empty User Backdrop
well in the Video Effects window.
As long as an item can be displayed in Quick Look, it can be used as a video
background. Think of the possibilities!
To try out a Photo Booth effect in iChat, choose Video➪Video Preview to dis-
play your live video feed, then chooseVideo➪Show Video Effects (or press
Ô+Shift+E). Figure 3-4 illustrates the Video Preview and Video Effects win-
dows; click a video effect thumbnail to see how it looks on you in the
Preview window! Effects range from simple Black & White to a Thermal
Camera look, an Andy Warhol–style Pop Art display, and a number of really
cool optical distortions (like Twirl and Light Tunnel).

After you find just the right video effect, close the two windows and start
chatting. If you decide you’d rather return your video persona to something
more conventional, display the Video Effects window again and click 
the Normal thumbnail (which appears in the center of the first screen of
thumbnails). 

Chapter 4: Expanding Your
Horizons with iDisk
In This Chapter
 Setting up iDisk
 Using files and folders on your iDisk
 Using public files
I
f you ask the average Mac owner what’s available on the Internet, you
likely hear benefits, such as e-mail, Web surfing, RSS feeds, Google, and
instant communication via iChat. What you probably won’t hear is,
“Convenient, trouble-free storage for my files and folders.”
You might have tried to use one of the dozens of storage sites on the
Internet that allows you to upload and download files from a personal file
area via your Web browser. Unfortunately, these Web-based storage sites are
slow in transferring files, lacking in convenience, and typically offer only a
small amount of space. As a result, most computer owners decide that the
idea of online storage is neat . . . but impractical.
In this chapter, I show you what real online storage is all about. I’m talking
about iDisk, which is the online storage feature that’s integrated into the
Mac OS X Finder. No jury-rigged Web site is necessary (although you can use
one if you’re not on a Mac running Leopard). I admit that online storage
doesn’t replace the hard drives on your Mac, but with a .Mac subscription,
you can easily make use of online storage for backups and sharing files with
your friends . . . from anywhere on the planet!
So how do you actually use iDisk? That’s the simple part! To use iDisk within
Mac OS X, just do what comes naturally — it works like any other removable
volume’s Finder window. You can copy and move files and folders to and
from your iDisk, create new subfolders (except in the Backup, Library, and
Software root folders, which are read-only), and delete whatever you don’t
need.

Grabbing Internet Storage for Your Mac
452
Grabbing Internet Storage for Your Mac
To set up iDisk on your Mac OS X system, you need a .Mac account. You did
create one during the installation of the Big X, right? These trial accounts are
limited to a maximum of 25MB of storage, and the trial account is active for
only 60 days. Therefore, if you decide that you like iDisk, subscribe to .Mac;
a subscription increases your online treasure chest to 512MB of iDisk stor-
age. To subscribe, visit www.mac.com and follow the prompts to join from
there. (At the time of this writing, the subscription fee is $100 per year.)
With a .Mac account active, iDisk is available automatically. To see how
much storage you’re using and to configure access to your Public folder,
open System Preferences, click the .Mac icon, and then click the iDisk button
to display the settings that you see in Figure 4-1. (You can also click the Buy
More button on this panel to subscribe to Apple’s .Mac service, or if you’re
already a .Mac subscriber, add additional storage space.)
The iDisk Disk Space bar graph illustrates how much of your current iDisk
territory you’re using. (Note that the account shown in Figure 4-1 is an evalu-
ation account, so it shows only a total of 25MB.)
You can specify the access privilege level for other .Mac users from this
panel as well. Select the Read Only radio button to prevent any other .Mac
user from copying files to your Public folder, or select the Read & Write radio
button to allow others to save files there.
Figure 4-1:
Your iDisk
settings are
available
from System
Preferences.

Book IV
Chapter 4
Expanding Your
Horizons with iDisk
Grabbing Internet Storage for Your Mac
453
No matter which privilege level you choose, you can also set a password
that other .Mac users must type before they’re allowed access to your Public
folder — this is the very definition of A Truly Good Idea. (More on the Public
folder in the next section.)
If you’ve already set a password, you can change it by clicking the Set
Password button and typing the new word in the Password box. Retype the
word in the Confirm box to verify it; then click OK to save the change and
return to the .Mac System Preferences panel.
Pinning down your iDisk
So where exactly are your files kept when 
you use your iDisk? In earlier versions of 
Mac OS X, your acre of storage farmland
always sat exclusively on one of Apple’s iDisk
file servers — perhaps in Cupertino, perhaps
elsewhere. These server computers are espe-
cially designed to store terabytes (TB) of infor-
mation (1TB equals 1,000GB), and they’re
connected to the Internet via high-speed trunk
lines. (And yes, they do have a firewall.) Your
Internet copy of your iDisk is still stored on an
Apple file server.
However, you can elect to keep a local copy of
your iDisk storage area — usually called a
mirror — on your Mac’s hard drive. (Because
Macs have copious hard drives, reserving
512MB or more is no problem.) Before you
scratch your head wondering why you’re dupli-
cating your iDisk files on your computer, here’s
the reason: If you do decide to keep a local
copy of your files, you can work on them even
when you’re not connected to the Internet!
Leopard automatically synchronizes any files
that you’ve updated locally with your remote
iDisk whenever you connect to the Internet. (If
you use multiple Macs at different locations,
think about being able to access the latest
copies of your files from any of them, right from
the Finder!)
This nifty mirror also greatly speeds up things
when you’re browsing the contents of your
iDisk or perhaps loading and saving an iDisk
document; that’s because you’re working with
your local copy, and Mac OS X updates any
changes that you make to the corresponding
remote file on the iDisk server. You can tell that
things are updating when that funky little yin
yang, circular doodad — the thing next to your
iDisk in the Finder window — is rotating in its
animated fashion. (And yes, I have it on good
authority . . . that’s what the Apple software
developers call it, too.)
You’re not required to use a mirror, however. To
disable the mirroring feature and return to the
remote-only operation of old, click the iDisk
Syncing Stop button on the iDisk panel in
System Preferences to turn it off. Remember,
though, that with the mirroring feature turned
off, you must have an Internet connection to
use iDisk, and things will move more slowly
because you’re accessing everything across
the Internet.

Understanding What’s on Your iDisk
454
Understanding What’s on Your iDisk
Unlike the physical hard drive in your Mac, your iDisk never needs format-
ting or defragmenting, and you never have to check it for errors. However,
the structure of an iDisk is fixed, so you can’t just go crazy creating your
own folders. In fact, you can’t create new folders at the root — the top 
level — of your iDisk at all, but you can create new folders inside most of the
root folders.
Now that you’re thoroughly rooterized, here are the folders that you find
hanging out in your iDisk:
✦Backup: This is a read-only folder that contains the backup files created
with the .Mac Backup application. You can, however, copy the files in
this folder to a removable drive on your system for an additional level of
safekeeping.
✦Documents: This folder holds any application documents that you want
to store . . . things like spreadsheets and letters. No one but you can
access these items.
✦Library: Another read-only folder. This spot contains the configuration
data and custom settings that you’ve created for other .Mac features.
✦Movies: QuickTime movies go here — again, you can add the movies
stored here to your Web pages. (I cover QuickTime like a blanket in Book
III, Chapter 8.)
✦Music: This is the repository for all your iTunes music and playlists, and
the contents can be added to your Web pages. (iTunes is the star of
Chapter 2 in Book III.) Mine is stuffed full of Mozart, Scarlatti, and that
Bach fellow.
✦Pictures: This folder is the vault for your JPEG and GIF images, including
those that you want to use with your Web pages.
✦Public: This is the spot to place files that you specifically want to share
with others, either directly through iDisk or with your Web pages. If
you’ve allowed write access, others can copy files to your Public folder
as well.
✦Sites: The Web pages that you store here can be created with the Apple
HomePage utility — which is available to all .Mac members — or you
can use iWeb, which I cover in Book III, Chapter 7. In fact, you can even
use your own Web page design application and copy the completed site
files here.
✦Software: Apple provides this read-only folder as a service to .Mac mem-
bers; it contains a selection of the latest freeware, shareware, and com-
mercial demos for you to enjoy. To try something out, open the Software
folder and copy whatever you like to your Mac OS X Desktop. Then you
can install and run the application from the local copy of the files.

Opening and Using iDisk
When you’re connected to the Internet, you can open your iDisk in one of
the following ways:
✦From the Finder menu, choose Go➪iDisk and then choose My iDisk
from the submenu or use the Ô+Shift+I keyboard shortcut.
✦Click the iDisk icon in the Finder Sidebar.
✦Add an iDisk button to your Finder window toolbar by choosing
View➪Customize Toolbar.
After you add the button, you can click it to connect to your iDisk from
anywhere in the Finder.
Your iDisk opens in a new Finder window. After you use one of these meth-
ods in a Mac OS X session, your iDisk icon appears on the Mac OS X
Desktop; Figure 4-2 shows the iDisk contents in a Finder window. The iDisk
volume icon remains until you shut down or restart your Mac. (Alternatively,
you can dismiss the iDisk volume icon from your Desktop using the same
method that you eject an external drive: Click the iDisk icon and press Ô+E
or click the Eject button next to the iDisk icon in the Finder window Sidebar.)
Figure 4-2:
The
contents 
of your 
iDisk —
pretty iNeat,
I’m thinking.

Opening and Using iDisk
456
If you’re using a remote computer with an Internet connection, you can log
in to the .Mac page at www.apple.com and use your Web browser to access
the contents of your iDisk. (Hey, sometimes this is the only choice you
have.)
However, you don’t actually need to open your iDisk in a Finder window to
use it because you can also load and save files directly to your iDisk from
within any application. Simply choose your iDisk as you would any of the
hard drives on your system when using the application’s Load, Save, or Save
As commands.
You can also open an iDisk Public folder — either yours or the Public folder
inside another person’s iDisk — as if it were an Internet file server. As I
explained earlier, if that person has set a password, you need to enter that
password to gain access to all of their iDisk folders. From the Finder menu,
choose Go➪iDisk➪Other User’s iDisk (or, to jump directly to their Public
folder, choose Go➪iDisk➪Other User’s Public Folder). If you choose the
former, Leopard prompts you for the other person’s member name and pass-
word; if you pick the latter, you need only enter the other .Mac member’s
account name.
After you enter a valid iDisk member name (and password, if required), you
see the .Mac member’s Public folder.
You can also use the server address
http://idisk.mac.com/username-Public?
to connect to an iDisk from computers running Windows and Linux. Check
the Help for your operating system to determine how to connect to a
WebDAV server (usually called a Web folder in the Windows world). When
prompted for your access username and password, use your .Mac account
name and password. If you’re using Windows XP, Apple has provided an even
easier way to open an iDisk Public folder: Use iDisk Utility for Windows,
which you can download from www.mac.com.

W
hen I was designing the Table of Contents for this book, I seriously
considered leaving this chapter out. After all, more people use a Web
browser now than any other software application. Who really needs a guide
to mowing a lawn?
But then again, I suddenly thought of all the hidden features that folks don’t
know about Apple’s Safari browser — for example, the tips and tricks that
can help you organize your online visits. It’s a little like finding out more
about the lawn mower itself: Even though you might not need tips on
mowing, many people don’t know how to remove the spark plug in the
winter or how to sharpen the blade so you can handle taller grass.
Remember, magic is nothing more than technology that someone understands.
In this chapter, I show you how to use those other controls and toolbar but-
tons in Safari — you know, the ones in addition to the Forward and Back
buttons — and you’ll discover how to keep track of where you’ve been and
where you’d like to go. (Oh, and did I mention that you’ll need an Internet
connection?)

Pretend You’ve Never Used This Thing
458
One note: Many authors have written entire books on Web browsing. As you
might guess, this chapter is far narrower in scope than those books — I’ve
got more ground to cover before dinner — and it doesn’t include every one
of Safari’s features. However, I think the coverage that you find here will
explain all that you’re likely to need for most surfing sessions.
Pretend You’ve Never Used This Thing
Figure 5-1 illustrates the Safari window. You can launch Safari directly from
the Dock, or you can click the Safari icon within your Applications folder.
Major sections of the Safari window include
✦The Address bar: You’ll find the most often used commands on this
toolbar for things like navigation, adding bookmarks, and searching
Google. Plus, here you can type or paste the address for Web sites that
you’d like to visit. The Address bar can be hidden to provide you with
more real estate in your browser window for Web content. To toggle
hidden mode, press Ô+| (the vertical bar right above the backslash) or

display of the Bookmarks bar by choosing View➪Hide/Show Bookmarks
Bar, or by pressing Ô+Shift+B.
✦The Content window: Congratulations! At last, you’ve waded through all
the pre-game show and you’ve reached the area where Web pages are
actually displayed. Like any other window, the Content window can be
scrolled; when you minimize Safari to the Dock, you get a thumbnail
(minimized) image of the Content window.
The Content window often contains underlined text and graphical icons
that transport you to other pages when you click them. These under-
lined words and icons are links, and they make it easy to move from one
area of a site to another or to a completely different site.
✦The Status bar: The status bar displays information about what the
mouse pointer is currently resting upon, like the address for a link or the
name of an image; it also updates you on what’s happening while a page
is loading. To hide or display the status bar, press Ô+/ (forward slash).
Visiting Web Sites
Here’s the stuff that virtually everyone over the age of five knows how to 
do . . . but I get paid by the word, and some folks might just not be aware of
all the myriad ways of visiting a site. You can load a Web page from any of
the following methods:
✦Type (or paste) a Web site address into the Address bar and then
press Return.
If you’re typing in an address and Safari recognizes the site as one that
you’ve visited in the past, it helps by completing the address for you. If
this is a new site, just keep typing.
✦Click a Bookmarks entry within Safari.
✦Click the Home button, which takes you to the home page that you
specify.
More on this in the section, “Setting Up Your Home Page,” later in this
chapter.
✦Click a page link in Apple Mail or another Internet-savvy application.
✦Click a page link within another Web page.
✦Use the Google box in the Address bar.

Navigating the Web
460
Click in the Google box, type the contents that you want to find, and
then press Return. Safari presents you with the search results page on
Google for the text that you entered. (In case you’ve been living under
the Internet equivalent of a rock for the last couple of years, Google.com
is the preeminent search site on the Web — people use Google to find
everything from used auto parts to ex-spouses.)
✦Click a Safari page icon on the Dock or in a Finder window.
For example, Mac OS X already has an icon in the default Dock that takes
you to the Mac OS X page on the Apple Web site. Drag a site from your
Bookmarks bar and drop it on the right side of the Dock. Clicking the
icon that you add launches Safari and automatically loads that site.
This trick only works on the side of the Dock to the right of the vertical
line.
If you minimize Safari to the Dock, you’ll see a thumbnail of the page with
the Safari logo superimposed on it. Click this thumbnail in the Dock to
restore the page to its full glory.
Navigating the Web
A typical Web surfing session is a linear experience — you bop from one
page to the next, absorbing the information that you want and discarding the
rest. However, after you visit a few sites, you might find that you need to
return to where you’ve been or head to the familiar ground of your home
page. Safari offers these navigational controls on the Address bar:
✦Back: Click the Back button (the left-facing arrow) on the toolbar to
return to the last page that you visited. Additional clicks take you to pre-
vious pages, in reverse order. The Back button is disabled if you haven’t
visited at least two sites.
✦Forward: If you’ve clicked the Back button at least once, clicking the
Forward button (the right-facing arrow) takes you to the next page 
(or through the pages) where you originally were, in forward order. 
The Forward button is disabled if you haven’t used the Back button.
✦Home: Click this button (look for the little house) to return to your
home page.
Not all these buttons and controls might appear on your Address bar. To
display or hide Address bar controls, choose View➪Customize Address
Bar. The sheet that appears works just like the Customize Toolbar sheet
within a Finder window: Drag the control you want from the sheet to
your Address bar or drag a control that you don’t want from the Address
bar to the sheet.

✦AutoFill: If you fill out a lot of forms online — when you’re shopping at
Web sites, for example — you can click the AutoFill button (which looks
like a little text box and a pen) to complete these forms for you. You can
set what information is used for AutoFill by choosing Safari➪Preferences
and clicking the AutoFill toolbar button.
To be honest, I’m not a big fan of releasing any of my personal informa-
tion to any Web site, so I don’t use AutoFill often. If you do decide to use
this feature, make sure that the connection is secure (look for the pad-
lock icon in the upper-right corner of the Safari window) and read the
site’s Privacy Agreement page first to see how your identity data will be
treated.
✦Text Size: Shrinks or expands the text on the page, offering smaller,
space-saving characters (for the shrinking crowd) or larger, easier-to-
read text (for the expanding crowd). Hence the button, which is labeled
with a small and large letter A.
✦Stop/Reload: Click Reload (which has a circular arrow) to refresh (reload)
the contents of the current page. Although most pages remain static,
some pages change their content at regular intervals or after you fill out a
form or click a button. By clicking Reload (look for the curvy arrow), you
can see what’s changed on these pages. (I use Reload every hour or so
with CNN.com, for example.) While a page is loading, the Reload button
turns into the Stop button — with a little X mark — and you can click it to
stop the loading of the content from the current page. This is a real boon
when a download takes foorrevverr, which can happen when you’re
trying to visit a very popular or very slow Web site (especially if you’re
using a dialup modem connection to the Internet). Using Stop is also
handy if a page has a number of very large graphics that are going to take
a long time to load.
✦Open in Dashboard: Click this button to create a Dashboard widget
using the contents of the currently displayed Web page. Safari prompts
you to choose which clickable section of the page to be included within
the widget’s borders (like the local radar map on your favorite weather
Web site) — click Add, and Dashboard loads automatically with your
new widget. (More on widgets in Book II, Chapter 2.)
✦Add Bookmark: Click this Address bar button (which carries a plus
sign) to add a page to your Bookmarks bar or Bookmarks menu. (More
on this in a tad.)
✦Google Search: As I mention earlier, you can click in this box and type
text that you want to find on the Web via the Google search engine —
press Return to display the results. To repeat a recent search, click the
down arrow in the Google Search box and select it from the pop-up
menu.

Setting Up Your Home Page

✦Print: Click this convenient button to print the contents of the Safari
window — dig that crazy printer icon!
✦Report Bug: A rather strange creature, the Safari Bug button makes it
easy to alert Apple when you encounter a page that doesn’t display
properly in Safari. (Software developers call such glitches bugs — hence
the name.) When you click the Bug button, you’ll see a sheet with the
settings shown in Figure 5-2; take time to enter a short description of the
problem that you’re having. (I also enable the Send Screen Shot of
Current Page and the Send Source of Current Page check boxes to give
the Apple folks more to work with while they’re debugging Safari.) Then
click the Submit button to send the bug report to Apple.
Setting Up Your Home Page
Choosing a home page is one of the easiest methods of speeding up your
Web surfing, especially if you’re using a dialup modem connection. However,
a large percentage of the Mac owners whom I’ve talked to have never set
their own home page, simply using the default home page provided by their
browser! With Safari running, take a moment to follow these steps to declare
your own freedom to choose your own home page:

1. If you want to use a specific Web page as your new home page, display
it in Safari.
I recommend electing a page with few graphics or a fast-loading popular
site.
2. Choose Safari➪Preferences or press Ô+, (comma).
3. Click the General button.
You’ll see the settings shown in Figure 5-3.
4. Click the Set to Current Page button.
5. Alternatively, click the New Windows Open With pop-up menu and
choose Empty Page if you want Safari to open a new window with a
blank page.
This is the fastest choice of all for a home page.
6. Click the Close button to exit the Preferences dialog.
Visit your home page at any time by pressing the Home button on the
Address bar.

Adding and Using Bookmarks
464
Adding and Using Bookmarks
No doubt about it: Bookmarks make the Web a friendly place. As you collect
bookmarks in Safari, you’re able to immediately jump from one site to
another with a single click of the Bookmarks menu or the buttons on the
Bookmarks bar.
To add a bookmark, first navigate to the desired page and then do any of the
following:
✦Choose Bookmarks➪Add Bookmark.
✦Press the Ô+D keyboard shortcut.
Safari displays a sheet where you can enter the name for the bookmark
and also select where it appears (on the Bookmarks bar or the
Bookmarks menu).
✦Drag the icon next to the Web address from the Address bar to the
Bookmarks bar.
You can also drag a link on the current page to the Bookmarks bar, but note
that doing this only adds a bookmark for the page corresponding to the 
link — not the current page.
Lean, fast, and mean — That’s RSS
Well, maybe not mean — after all, I don’t want
you to be afraid of RSS (RDF Site Summary)
pages! RSS Web sites display updated infor-
mation using a shortened list format, rather like
a newspaper headline, without unnecessary
graphics or silly advertisements. You can tell
when a Web site has RSS pages available
because Safari displays an RSS icon at the
right side of the Address box. (When you click
the RSS icon, the Web address switches to a
feed:// prefix — another indication that
you’re not in Kansas reading HTML pages 
anymore.)
To display more information about a news item
on an RSS page, click the item headline. Safari
opens the corresponding Web page — 
yep, once again you’re back in the world of 
HTML — and you can read the full story. To
return to the RSS feed, click the Back button on
the Address bar. Naturally, RSS feed pages can
be bookmarked. In fact, Apple gives you a
number of RSS sites that you can explore
immediately.
To customize your RSS display, choose Safari➪
Preferences and then click the RSS tab. By
default, Safari checks for updated RSS head-
lines every 30 minutes, but you can change this
to an hourly or daily check. (Of course, you can
also check for updates manually by reloading
the RSS page, just like you would any other
Web page.) New articles can be assigned any
color you like, and you can specify the amount
of time an item should remain on the RSS page
after it’s published.

Adding and Using Bookmarks
465
To jump to a bookmark
✦Choose it from the Bookmarks menu.
If the bookmark is contained in a folder, which I discuss later in this 
section, move your mouse pointer over the folder name to show its 
contents and then click the bookmark.
✦Click the bookmark on the Bookmarks bar.
If you’ve added a large number of items to the Bookmarks bar, click the
More icon on the edge of the Bookmarks bar to display the rest of the
buttons.
✦Click the Show All Bookmarks button (which looks like a small
opened book) on the Bookmarks bar and then click the desired 
bookmark.
The Bookmarks window that you see in Figure 5-4 appears, where you
can review each collection of bookmarks at leisure.
The more bookmarks that you add, the more unwieldy the Bookmarks
menu and the Bookmarks window become. To keep things organized,
choose Bookmarks➪Add Bookmark Folder and then type a name for the
new folder. With folders, you can organize your bookmarks into collec-
tions, which appear in the column at the left of the Bookmarks window
(or as separate submenus within the Bookmarks menu). You can drag
bookmarks within the new folder to help reduce the clutter.

Downloading Files
466
To delete a bookmark or a folder from the Bookmarks window, click it and
then press Delete.
Downloading Files
A huge chunk of the fun that you’ll find on the Web is the ability to download
images and files. If you’ve visited a site that offers files for downloading, typi-
cally you just click the Download button or the download file link, and Safari
takes care of the rest. You’ll see the Downloads status window, which keeps
you updated with the progress of the transfer. While the file is downloading,
feel free to continue browsing or even download additional files; the status
window helps you keep track of what’s going on and when everything will be
finished transferring. To display the Download status window from the key-
board, press Ô+Option+L.
By default, Safari saves any downloaded files to the new spiffy Downloads
folder in your Dock, which I like and use. To specify the location where
downloaded files are stored — for example, if you’d like to scan them auto-
matically with an antivirus program — follow these steps:
1. Choose Safari➪Preferences or press Ô+, (comma).
2. Click the General tab and then click the Save Downloaded Files To
pop-up menu.
3. Choose Other.
4. Navigate to the location where you want the files stored.
5. Click the Select button.
6. Click the Close button to exit Preferences.
To download a specific image that appears on a Web page, move your mouse
pointer over the image and hold down Control while you click (or right-click,
if you’ve got the button to spare). Then choose Download Image to Disk from
the pop-up menu that appears. Safari prompts you for the location where
you want to store the file.
You can choose to automatically open files that Safari considers safe —
things like movies, text files and PDF files that are very unlikely to store a
virus or a damaging macro. By default, the Open “safe” files after download-
ing check box is enabled on the General pane . . . however, if you’re inter-
ested in preventing anything you download from running until you’ve
manually checked it with your antivirus application, you can disable the
check box and breathe easy.

Tabs Are Your Browsing Friends
467
Luckily, Safari has matured to the point that it can seamlessly handle virtually
any multimedia file type that it encounters. However, if you’ve downloaded a
multimedia file and Safari doesn’t seem to be able to play or display it, try
loading the file within QuickTime. As you can read in Book III, Chapter 8,
QuickTime is the Swiss Army knife of multimedia players, and it can recog-
nize a huge number of audio, video, and image formats.
Using Subscriptions and History
To keep track of where you’ve been, you can display the History list by click-
ing the History menu. To return to a page in the list, just choose it from the
History menu. Note that Safari also arranges older history items by the date
you visited the site, so you can easily jump back a couple of days to that
page you forgot to bookmark!
In fact, Safari also searches the History list automatically, when it fills in an
address that you’re typing — that’s the feature I mention in the earlier sec-
tion “Visiting Web Sites.”
If you’re worried about security and you’d rather not keep track of where
you’ve been online, I show you how to clear the contents of the History file
in the upcoming section, “Handling ancient history.”
Tabs Are Your Browsing Friends
Safari also offers tabbed browsing, which many folks use to display (and
organize) multiple Web pages at one time. For example, if you’re doing a bit
of comparison shopping for a new piece of hardware between different
online stores, tabs are ideal.
When you hold down the Ô key and click a link or bookmark using tabs, a
tab representing the new page appears under the Bookmarks bar. Just click
the tab to switch to that page. (If you don’t hold down Ô, things revert to
business as usual, and Safari replaces the contents of the window with the
new page.) Figure 5-5 illustrates a number of pages that I’ve opened in Safari
using tabs.
To turn on tabbed browsing, choose Safari➪Preferences to display the
Preferences dialog; then click Tabs. From here, select the Ô-click opens a
link in a new tab check box to turn on tabs.
Done with a page? You can remove a tabbed page by clicking the X button
next to the tab’s title.

Saving Web Pages
468
Saving Web Pages
If you’ve encountered a page that you’d like to load later, you can save it to
disk in its entirety. (Just the text, mind you, not the images.) Follow these
steps:
1. Display the desired page.
2. Choose File➪Save As, or press Ô+S.
3. In the Save As text field, type a name for the saved page.
4. From the Where field, navigate to the location where you want to
store the file on your system.
To expand the sheet to allow navigation to any location on your system,
click the button with the downward arrow.
5. Click the Format pop-up menu to choose the format for the saved
page.
Usually, you’ll want to choose a Web Archive, which saves the entire
page and can be displayed just as you see it. However, if you want to
save just the HTML source code, choose Page Source.
6. Click Save to begin the download process.
After the Save file has been created, double-click it to load it in Safari.

A quick word about printing a page within Safari: Some combinations of
background and text colors might conspire together to render your printed
copy practically worthless. In a case like that, use your printer’s grayscale
setting (if it has one). Alternatively, you can simply click and drag to select
the text on the page, press Ô+C to copy it, and then paste the text into Word
or Pages, where you can print the page on a less offensive background
(while still keeping the text formatting largely untouched). You can also save
the contents of a page as plain text, as I just demonstrated.
If you’d rather mail the contents of a Web page to a friend — or just a link to
the page, which is faster to send over a dialup Internet connection — choose
File➪Mail Contents of this Page/Mail Link to this Page. (From the keyboard,
press Ô+I to send the contents in an e-mail message, or press Ô+Shift+I to
send a link in e-mail.) Mail loads automatically, complete with a prepared
e-mail message. Just address it to the recipients and then click Send!
Protecting Your Privacy
No chapter on Safari would be complete without a discussion of security,
both against outside intrusion from the Internet and prying eyes around
your Mac. Hence this last section, which covers protecting your privacy.
Although diminutive, the tiny padlock icon that appears in the top-right
corner of the Safari window when you’re connected to a secure Web site
means a great deal! A secure site encrypts the information that you send and
receive, making it much harder for those of unscrupulous ideals to obtain
things like credit card numbers and personal information.
Yes, there are such things as bad cookies
First, a definition of this ridiculous term: A cookie, a small file that a Web site
automatically saves on your hard drive, contains information that the site
will use on your future visits. For example, a site might save a cookie to pre-
serve your site preferences for the next time or — in the case of a site such
as Amazon.com — to identify you automatically and help customize the
offerings that you see.
In and of themselves, cookies aren’t bad things. Unlike a virus, a cookie file
isn’t going to replicate itself or wreak havoc on your system, and only the
original site can read the cookie that it creates. However, many folks don’t
appreciate acting as a gracious host for a slew of little snippets of personal
information. Also, if you do a large amount of surfing, cookies can occupy a
significant amount of your hard drive space over time. (Not to mention that
some cookies have highly suggestive names, which could lead to all sorts of
conclusions. End of story.)

Protecting Your Privacy
470
You can choose to accept all cookies — the default — or you can opt to 
disable cookies altogether. You can also set Safari to accept cookies only
from the sites you choose to visit. To change your Cookie Acceptance Plan
(or CAP, for those who absolutely crave acronyms), follow these steps:
1. Choose Safari➪Preferences.
2. Click the Security toolbar button.
Safari displays the preference settings shown in Figure 5-6.
3. Choose how to accept cookies via these radio button choices:
Never: Block cookies entirely.
Always: Accept all cookies.
Only from Sites You Navigate To: Personally, I use this default option,
which allows sites like Amazon.com to work correctly without allow-
ing a barrage of illicit cookies.
4. To view the cookies currently on your system, click the Show Cookies
button.
If a site’s cookies are blocked, you might have to take care of things man-
ually, like providing a password on the site that used to be read automat-
ically from the cookie.
5. Click the Close button to save your changes.

Cleaning your cache
Safari speeds up the loading of Web sites by storing often-used images and
multimedia files in a temporary storage, or cache, folder. Naturally, the files
in your cache folder can be displayed (hint), which could lead to assump-
tions (hint, hint) about the sites you’ve been visiting (hint, hint, hint).
(Tactful, ain’t I?)
Luckily, Safari makes it easy to dump the contents of your cache file. Just
choose Safari➪Empty Cache; then click Empty to confirm that you want to
clean up your cache.
Handling ancient history
As you might imagine, your History file leaves a very clear set of footprints
indicating where you’ve been on the Web. To delete the contents of the
History menu, choose History➪Clear History.
The latest version of Safari also allows you to specify an amount of time to
retain entries in your History file. Open the Safari Preferences dialog, click
the General tab, and then click the Remove History Items pop-up menu to
specify the desired amount of time. Items can be rolled off daily, weekly,
biweekly, monthly, or yearly.
Avoiding those @*!^%$ pop-up ads
I hate pop-up ads, and I’m sure you do, too. To block most of those pop-up
windows with advertisements for everything from low-rate mortgages to
“sure-thing” Internet casinos, click the Safari menu and verify that Block 
Pop-Up Windows is checked. (If it’s not checked, click the menu item to
toggle the menu item on.)
From time to time, you might run across a Web site that actually does some-
thing constructive with pop-up windows, like present a download or login
prompt. If you need to temporarily deactivate pop-up blocking, press
Ô+Shift+K to toggle it off. Then press Ô+Shift+K again to turn pop-up block-
ing back on after you’ve finished with the site.

Chapter 6: Staying Secure Online
In This Chapter
 Understanding the dangers of going online
 Using a firewall
 Avoiding trouble online
I
know that you’ve heard horror stories about hacking: Big corporations
and big government installations seem to be as open to hackers as a
public library. Often, you read that even entire identities are being stolen
online. When you consider that your Mac can contain very sensitive and pri-
vate information in your life — such as your Social Security number and
financial information — it’s enough to make you nervous about turning on
your computer long enough to check your eBay auctions.
But how much of that is Hollywood? How truly real is the danger, especially
to Mac owners? And how can you protect yourself? The good news is that
you can easily secure your data from all but the most determined hacker —
in fact, depending on the hardware that you’re using to connect to the
Internet, you might be well guarded right now without even knowing it.
In this chapter, I continue a quest that I’ve pursued for over a decade now —
to make my readers feel comfortable and secure in the online world by
explaining the truth about what can happen and telling you how you can
protect your system from intrusions.
One quick note: This chapter is written with the home and small business
Mac owner in mind. Macs that access the Internet through a larger corpo-
rate network are very likely already protected by that knight in shining
armor, the network system administrator. (Insert applause here.) Of course,
if you’re using Mac OS X in your office, you’re still welcome to read and
follow this material — especially if you have a laptop that could act as a car-
rier for viruses from home — however, check with your system administra-
tor before you attempt to implement any of the recommendations that I
make.

What Can Really Happen?
474
What Can Really Happen?
Before I begin, I want to offer you a moment of reassurance and a little of my
personal background to explain that I’m well qualified to be your guide
through this online minefield. (After all, you don’t want Jerry Lewis lecturing
you on how to maintain your Internet security. He’s a funny guy, though, 
convenez-vous?)
✦I’ve been running and managing all sorts of online systems since the
days of the BBS (Bulletin Board System), the text-based dinosaurs that
used to rule the online world in the late ’80s and early ’90s. (In fact, my
first book was on this very subject — and it contained a chapter on
viruses long before they were the darlings of the techno-media.)
✦As a consultant, I run Web sites and squash virus attacks for a number of
companies and organizations.
✦I run a popular Internet radio station that serves up ’70s hits in CD-qual-
ity to anyone with a high-speed DSL or cable Internet connection and a
copy of iTunes. (More on this broadcasting revolution in Book III,
Chapter 2.)
✦I keep my own office network of six computers safe from attack while
still providing readers all over the world with Web sites and the afore-
mentioned radio station and BBS.
With that understood, here’s what can happen to you online without the
right safeguards, on any computer:
✦Hackers can access shared information on your network. If you’re run-
ning an unguarded network, it’s possible for others to gain access to
your documents and applications or wreak havoc on your system.
If it smells phishy . . .
Ever heard of the word phishing? It’s a recently
coined Internet term, so you might not have
encountered it yet. Con artists and hackers
create Web sites that look just like major online
stores — including big names like eBay,
PayPal, and Amazon. These turkeys then send
out junk e-mail messages that tell you that 
you must log on to this Web site to refresh or
correct your personal information. As you’ve 
no doubt already guessed, that information is
siphoned off and sold to the highest bidder.
Your credit card, your password, and your
address. Luckily, if you follow the tips that I give
later in this chapter in the section “A Dose 
of Common Sense: Things Not to Do Online,”
you’ll avoid these phishing expeditions!

Chapter 6

What Can Really Happen?
475
✦Your system could be infected with a virus or dangerous macro. Left
to their own devices, these misbehaving programs and macro com-
mands can delete files or turn your entire hard drive into an empty
paperweight. (Although Mac viruses are few and far between as I write
this, I don’t think we’ll enjoy such luxury for long. Plus, if you dual-boot
your Intel Mac into Windows XP, you’ve suddenly entered a veritable
minefield of PC viruses and spyware. More on this in a page or two.)
✦Unsavory individuals could attempt to contact members of your
family. This kind of attack may take place through iChat AV, e-mail, or
Web discussion boards, putting your family’s safety at risk.
✦Hackers can use your system to attack others. Your computer can be
tricked into helping hackers when they attempt to knock out Web
servers and public access File Transfer Protocol (FTP) sites on the
Internet. Along the same lines, that innocent Web server that you put
online could be misused by spam-spewing, online “entrepreneurs.” (Cute
name, right?)
More of Mark’s totally unnecessary 
computer trivia
The term hacker dates far back in the annals of
the personal computer — in fact, it originally
had nothing to do with networks, the Internet,
or illegal activities at all . . . because In The
Beginning, there was no public Internet!
“Explain yourself, Chambers!” All right. The
original hackers were electronics buffs, ham
radio operators, computer hobbyists, and engi-
neers who built (or hacked) a working com-
puter out of individual components with a
soldering gun and a whole lotta guts. At the
time, you didn’t simply order a computer from
Dell or visit your local Maze o’ Wires store in
the mall to select your favorite system.
No, I’m talking about the mid-’70s, in the hal-
cyon time before IBM even introduced the 
IBM PC (and when the only folks using the
Internet, which wasn’t called that back then,
were military folks and researchers). Even the
simplest computer — really nothing more than
a glorified calculator by today’s standards —
had to be lovingly assembled by hand. These
early personal computers didn’t run software
as we know it. Instead, you programmed them
manually through a bank of switches on the
front, and they responded with codes displayed
on a bank of lights. (Think about that next time
you launch Microsoft Word.)
Today, of course, the need to assemble a com-
puter from individual transistors is nonexistent,
and the word hacker has an entirely different
connotation — but don’t be surprised if you
meet an older member of your Macintosh
user’s group who’s proud to be an old-fash-
ioned hacker! (Look for the soldering gun, usu-
ally worn in a holster like a sidearm.)

What Can Really Happen?
476
✦Criminals can attempt to con you out of your credit card or personal
information. The Internet is a prime candidate for identity theft.
To be absolutely honest, some danger is indeed present every time that you
or any user of your Macintosh connects to the Internet. However, here’s the
good news. With the right safeguards, it’s literally impossible for most of
those worst-case scenarios to happen on your Macintosh, and what remains
would be so difficult that even the most die-hard hacker would throw in the
towel long before reaching your computer or network.
And you’re using a Macintosh — hackers and virus developers (there’s a
career for you) are traditionally interested only in “having fun” with PCs 
running Windows, so the likelihood that Leopard could pick up a virus is far
less than it would be if you were using Windows XP. As I mentioned earlier, if
you boot into Windows XP using Leopard’s dual-boot feature on your Intel-
based Macintosh, you’ll need to pay heed to Windows XP security.
Because this is a book that focuses on Mac OS X Leopard, I won’t be spend-
ing much time covering Windows XP. If you’d like a comprehensive guide to
Windows XP and the PC world, however, I can heartily recommend the sister
volume to this book, PCs All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, Third
Edition, published by Wiley. Why the strong recommendation? Well, I wrote
that book as well!
Evidently, Apple just doesn’t have the numbers to attract the attention of the
Bad Guys yet . . . yet another reason to enjoy the exclusive nature of the Mac
universe! (Heck, I even know a couple of fellow Mac owners who feel they
just don’t need antivirus protection — but believe me, this is not an area
where you want to be lax and lazy, and you still need an antivirus applica-
tion! More on antivirus software later in this chapter.)
I also want to point out that virtually everyone reading this book — as well
as the guy writing it — really doesn’t have anything that’s worth a malicious
hacking campaign. Things like Quicken data files, saved games of Sims 2, and
genealogical data might be priceless to us, of course, but most dedicated
hackers are after bigger game. Unfortunately, the coverage that the media
and Hollywood give to corporate and government attacks can turn even
Aunt Harriet more than a little paranoid. Therefore, time for another of
Mark’s Maxims:
It’s not really necessary to consider the FBI or Interpol each time you
poke your Mac’s power button. A few simple precautions are all that’s
required.™

“Okay, Mark, now I know the real story on what can happen to my computer
online. So what do I do to safeguard my Macintosh?” You need but two
essential tools to protect your hardware (besides a healthy amount of
common sense, which I cover in the upcoming section “A Dose of Common
Sense: Things Not to Do Online”): a firewall and an antivirus program.
Firewall basics
First, a definition: a firewall is a piece of hardware or software that essen-
tially builds an impermeable barrier between the computers on your side of
the wall (meaning your Mac and any other computers on your network) and
all external computers on the other side of the wall (meaning the rest of the
Internet).
“But wait a second — if other computers can’t reach me and my Mac can’t
reach them, how can I use the Internet at all?” Ah, that’s the beauty of
today’s firewalls. By using a series of techniques designed to thwart attacks
from the outside, a firewall allows you to communicate safely, even monitor-
ing what you send and what you receive for later examination. Figure 6-1
illustrates the basics of a firewall.
A firewall sounds grand and incredibly complex and highly technical — and
sometimes it is — but it can also be incredibly simple. For example:
✦You can spend anywhere from $50 to thousands of dollars installing
sophisticated firewall hardware and/or software.
or
✦You can activate your firewall by disconnecting your dialup, digital 
subscriber line (DSL), or cable modem from the wall socket.
Believe it or not, both of those examples technically involve a firewall. In the
first case, the firewall is a physical, tangible presence on the network; in the
second case, the lack of a connection to the Internet actually acts as a fire-
wall. (Think of it as the Air Firewall.) I’ve spoken to a number of readers who
actually do this — however, if you’re running a Web site or downloading a
file from your company’s FTP site, yanking the connection when you head to
bed isn’t an option. Therefore, most of us will install a physical firewall
through hardware or software.

“Shields Up, Chekov!”
478
Do I already have a firewall?
In some cases, you might already be using a hardware firewall and not even
know it. For example, many Internet-sharing devices include a built-in NAT
firewall. NAT stands for Network Address Translation, and it’s the most effec-
tive and popular hardware firewall standard in use by consumer devices. If
you’re using an Internet sharing hub or router, check its manual to deter-
mine whether it offers NAT as a firewall feature — and if so, turn it on if NAT
isn’t enabled by default. (See Book V, Chapter 2 for more on Internet sharing,
routers, and firewalls.)
For instance, Figure 6-2 illustrates the configuration screen for my Internet
router. Note the options to disable port scanning and ping responses, which
are two tricks that hackers often use to detect what’s often called a hot 
computer — meaning that the computer can be identified and is accessible 
to attack. (Wireless networks are notoriously hot — for more information on
securing your wireless connections, visit Book V, Chapter 4.)
Using the internal Mac OS X firewall
Mac OS X includes a powerful internal firewall, which Leopard makes very
simple to use! (In early versions of Mac OS X, the internal firewall — actually
a UNIX application — was completely command driven from the Terminal.)
The Mac OS X firewall is configured through System Preferences — find more
information on setting up your firewall in Book V, Chapter 2.

Using a commercial software firewall
You’ll also find a number of popular alternatives to Leopard’s built-in firewall
on the market. Here are two commercial software firewall applications that
are proven to be both effective and easy-to-use:
✦Symantec, Norton Personal Firewall, $50 (www.symantec.com):
Symantec provides both antivirus and firewall protection for the PC and
Macintosh. Frequent updates and top-of-the-line technical support ensure
that your firewall stays current and that you can get help when you need it.
✦Intego, NetBarrier X4, $70 (www.intego.com): NetBarrier X comes
with a number of preset configurations that allow you to choose a basic
firewall for your network environment with a single click.
Whether you set up the internal firewall, a shareware firewall, or a commercial
firewall, visit a favorite site of mine on the Web: www.grc.com, the home 
of Gibson Research Corporation. There you’ll find the free online utility
ShieldsUP!!, which will automatically test just how tight your firewall is and
how susceptible your Mac could be to hacker attacks. Visit this site often
because this service is updated periodically to reflect new hacking techniques.

Antivirus basics
Next, consider your antivirus protection (both under Leopard and Windows
XP, if you’re running an Intel-based Mac). Viruses are typically transmitted
through applications — you run a program, and the virus is activated.
(Although not the traditional definition of a virus, both scripts and macros
can be used to take control of your system and cause trouble, as well.)
Therefore, you need to closely monitor what I call The Big Three:
✦Web downloads: Consider every file that you receive from the Internet
as a possible viral threat.
✦Removable media: Viruses can be stored on everything from CD-ROMs
and DVD-ROMs to Zip disks and even archaic floppy disks.
✦E-mail file attachments: An application sent to you as an e-mail attach-
ment is an easy doorway to your system.
Horrors! Mac OS X has no built-in antivirus support. (Then again, neither
does Windows XP.) However, a good antivirus program will take care of any
application that’s carrying a virus. Some even handle destructive macros
within documents. Make sure that the antivirus program that you choose
offers real-time scanning, which operates when you download or open a file.
Periodic scanning of your entire system is important, too, but only a real-
time scanning application like Norton AntiVirus can immediately ensure that
the StuffIt archive or the application you just received in your e-mail Inbox is
actually free from viruses. (Oh, and don’t forget that many of the Software
Updates released by Apple for Leopard will plug security holes in our
favorite operating system.)
Virus technology continues to evolve over time, just like more beneficial
application development. For example, recently a virus has been discovered
that’s actually contained in a JPEG image file! With a good antivirus applica-
tion that offers regular updates, you’ll continue to keep your system safe
from viral attack.
I heartily recommend both Norton AntiVirus from Symantec (available in
versions for Leopard and Windows XP) and Intego’s VirusBarrier X (available
for Leopard only). Both programs include automatic updates delivered while
you’re online to make sure that you’re covered against the latest viruses.
A Dose of Common Sense: Things Not to Do Online
One more powerful weapon that you can use to make sure that your Mac
stays safe from unlawful intrusion is this: Practicing common sense on the
Internet is just as important as adding a firewall and an antivirus application
to your Mac.

With this in mind, here’s a checklist of things that you should never do while
you’re online:
✦Never download a file from a site you don’t trust. And make sure that
your antivirus software is configured to check downloaded files before
you open them.
✦Never open an e-mail attachment until it’s been checked. Don’t give in
to temptation, even if the person who sent the message is someone you
trust. (Many of today’s macro viruses actually replicate themselves by
sending copies to the addresses found through the victim’s e-mail pro-
gram. Of course, this problem crops up regularly in the Windows world,
but it’s been known to happen in the Macintosh community as well.)
✦Never enter any personal information in an e-mail message unless you
know the recipient. Sure, I send my mailing address to friends and
family, but no one else. In fact, even e-mail can be intercepted by a deter-
mined hacker, so if you’re sending something truly important, use an
encryption application, like PGP Personal Desktop (www.pgp.com).
✦Never enter any personal information on a Web site provided as a link
in an e-mail message. Don’t fall prey to phishing expeditions. Some of
these e-mail message/Web site combinations look authentic enough to
fool anyone! No reputable online company or store is going to demand
or solicit your personal information through e-mail or through a linked
Web site. In fact, feel free to contact the company through its real Web
site and report the phishing attempt!
✦Never include any personal information in an Internet newsgroup
post. After all, these posts can be viewed by anyone with a newsgroup
account, so there’s no such thing as privacy in a newsgroup. (For a
glimpse of just how long a newsgroup post can linger in the great
Internet continuum, visit www.google.com, click the Groups button,
and search for your name. I can pull up newsgroup messages that I
posted back in 1995!)
✦Never buy from an online store that doesn’t offer a secure, encrypted
connection when you’re prompted for your personal information and
credit card number. If you’re using Apple’s Safari browser, the padlock
icon appears at the top-right corner of the Safari window. When the pad-
lock icon appears in the window, the connection is encrypted and
secure.
✦Never divulge personal information to others over an iChat AV 
connection.
✦Never use the same password for all your electronic business. Use dif-
ferent passwords that include both letters and numbers, change them
often, and never divulge them to anyone else.

A Dose of Common Sense: Things Not to Do Online
482
✦Never give anyone else administrative access to your Web or FTP
server.
✦Never allow any type of remote access to your Macintosh or your 
network without testing that access first. It’s very important to restrict
remote access to visitors whom you trust.

Internet hacker attacks — in Book V. I cover System Preferences that can

I
n the not-so-distant past — I’m talking 10–15 years ago — networks were
found only in huge companies that had the money and the workforce to
pay for and maintain them. But now, as technology rolls on, a home or small
office network is both very affordable and relatively easy to create. In this
chapter, I introduce you to this helpful beastie: You discover what networks
are, what you can do with them, and how to set up a small network of your
own for your home or small business.
Networks can be used for many things. Computers exchange all types of
data over a network: files that you want to send between computers or to
networked printers, streaming audio or video broadcasts, data for multi-
player computer games, or even a private company Web site (typically
called an intranet). Anything that you can imagine that would involve
moving data between multiple computers can be done by using a network.
What Do I Need to Set Up My Network?
First, let me define network. In a nutshell, a network is a combination of
hardware, cables, and software that allows computers and printers to talk to
each other. (Heck, you don’t even need cables with a wireless network, as I
show you in Chapter 4 of this mini-book.) To have a network, you need the
right hardware and software. Some of the hardware and most of the soft-
ware that you’ll need probably came with your Mac, depending on which
Mac you have. When you progress through this chapter, you’ll discover
everything that’s required to set up your network so that you can pick up
any additional parts you need. Any good-sized computer store (either the
brick-and-mortar or online variety) has everything that you need to get up
and running.

What Do I Need to Set Up My Network?
486
Now, back to the requirements: You need the right hardware and software 
to make your network sing. This section covers each component with a
description about the role that each part plays on the network and other
good stuff that you’ll want to know to get your network right the first time.
Something to network
Okay, this might be obvious, but I’m nothing if not thorough. The first thing
that you need to build a network is . . . well . . . stuff! That’s right, you need to
have devices that you want to network. Most times these are computers
(whether Macs or PCs running Windows/Linux/UNIX), printers, personal dig-
ital assistants (PDAs), cell phones, and other standalone, network-capable
devices (such as file servers and shared tape back-up drives).
Network interface card (NIC)
A network interface card, or NIC, is a hardware device that your computer
uses to talk to the rest of the network. The NIC connects to the network
cabling, and it speaks the language of electronics, sending data around the
network. Nowadays, most networks use the Ethernet networking protocol,
and most NICs are Ethernet-compatible. All current Mac models have an
Ethernet NIC built right in that, in fact, isn’t really a card at all but something
built right onto the Mac’s main system board. If you have an older Mac, say
one bought before the turn of the century, you can usually find used network
hardware on eBay.
Hub or switch
So you have an assortment of devices in your home or small office that
you’ve decided to network. How do you make them all interconnect?
Although you could connect just two computers together by using nothing
more than a single crossover cable, you need fancier hardware to connect
more than two computers: namely, a hub or a switch. The hub or the switch,
used to connect everything, is the focal point of the network. Without a hub
or switch, you wouldn’t have a network.
Hubs
A hub is a small box that has a bunch of Ethernet ports on it. A port is really
just like an Ethernet NIC on your computer, but a hub or switch has lots of
them. Inside, a hub connects all those Ethernet ports so that the talking
(sending) wires from each port connect to the listening (receiving) wires on
all other ports — therefore, when one computer talks, all others listen. As a
side effect of how hubs work, if more than one computer tries to talk at once,
a collision happens. Collisions are a Bad Thing: The data that was being sent
by the two computers is lost and has to be re-sent.

Book V
Chapter 1
Setting Up a 
Small Network
What Do I Need to Set Up My Network?
487
Although they might seem relatively harmless, collisions can really take a
toll on your Ethernet network. When data starts flying around your network,
collisions will take over and limit the amount of data that you can get
through the network. (My technical editor compares this problem with
dining in a noisy restaurant while you endeavor to listen to three conversa-
tions at once.) Typically, you can only use about 40 percent of the total
speed, or bandwidth, of the hub, which is why switches are everywhere and
hubs are rapidly disappearing to the Land of Archaic Hardware. (More on
switches in the next section.)
Setting up a hub (and therefore giving birth to your network, which sounds
more painful than it is) is usually no more difficult than connecting a power
cable to the device and then plugging in your computers with their own
Ethernet cables. You’ll see various lights on the hub — usually a power light
indicating that the hub is powered on and operational. You’ll also see lights
that correspond to each port on the hub — these lights tell you what’s going
on in the hub. For instance, you normally see the following types of lights:
Thirty-nine flavors of Ethernet . . . 
but no Rocky Road
Ethernet standards allow for operation at dif-
ferent speeds. Because the Ethernet standard
has improved over time, some older Ethernet
devices support only the older (slower) speeds.
Ethernet’s speed is rated by how much data it
can transfer in a second — usually in millions
of bits per second, or megabits per second
(Mbps). Originally, Ethernet was designed to
run at 10 Mbps. Now there are different speeds
of Ethernet: 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1000 Mbps,
and even faster.
1000 Mbps Ethernet — also called Gigabit
Ethernet or just Gigabit for short — is still a bit
on the expensive side for small home or office
networks. All consumer-level Gigabit Ethernet
NICs also support running at 10 Mbps or 100
Mbps, so you will hear them called 10/100/1000
Ethernet NICs. All current Mac models come
with a 10/100/1000 Ethernet NIC built in, including
the MacBook and Mac Mini. Although Gigabit
NICs are now priced under $100, most of the
devices that can connect Gigabit NICs still cost
significantly more than their 10/100 counterparts.
That fact, coupled with the reality that most
computer systems can’t really even handle or
dish out that much data, makes Gigabit Ethernet
a choice for only those wanting a high-end net-
work with the best performance.
NICs and other Ethernet equipment that only
handle 10 Mbps are rapidly becoming obsolete
because virtually all the modern NICs and other
Ethernet hardware support both 10 Mbps and
100 Mbps. Most times, you’ll see this labeled as
10/100 Ethernet. For your home networking, you
probably want to invest in 10/100 Mbps.
Remember: Keep your eye out for Ethernet
NICs and equipment that handle only 100 Mbps.
You won’t see it much, but be wary because it
can’t interconnect with 10 Mbps Ethernet NICs
and equipment. I advise against buying it —
stay compatible, and you’ll be a happy puppy.

✦Link light: Each port on a hub should have a link light. Link lights simply
tell you which ports have something alive connected to a given port:
That is, a device is connected and powered on. On hubs that support 
10 and 100 Mbps, the speed light is also used to indicate a link, so there
isn’t a separate link light.
✦Speed light: Each port on the hub should have a speed light. On hubs
that support both 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps, this tells you the speed of the
device at the other end. Some hubs have different lights for different
speeds, and some use a single light and make it different colors for dif-
ferent speeds.
✦Activity light: When one computer speaks, they all hear it. Typically, an
entire hub has only one activity light for the entire hub, indicating that
someone is speaking. With heavy traffic, the light could appear solid.
✦Collision light: Just like the activity light, collisions affect everything
connected to the hub, so logic dictates having only one collision light for
the entire hub. This light will flash whenever a collision occurs, which
can happen even with only two devices attached. When you add more
devices, you get more collisions; if this light stays on most of the time,
look into getting a switch. Speaking of which . . . .
Switches
A hub is a relatively simple way to connect a bunch of cables to allow com-
puters to talk. (They’re not particularly intelligent or efficient creatures.) 
A hub just receives network data on one port and sends (broadcasts) a copy
out through all the other ports. A switch, on the other hand, is a more
advanced “post office” for your network because a switch uses the informa-
tion in the network data to eliminate collisions and thus increase the effi-
ciency of your network. Although a switch looks almost exactly like a hub,
it’s far superior to the hub.
Bear with me whilst I spew techno-talk for a paragraph or two. When an
Ethernet switch receives a frame — that’s the name for a standard unit, or
packet, of network data — it reads the label on the frame to see the return
address of the computer that sent the frame. In a short amount of time (after
being turned on and watching the data move around), a switch figures out
which computer is located on which port. Then, whenever data comes into
the switch, it looks at the header (some information on the front of all
frames, much like a mailing label on a package that you send) and sees
which computer should receive the frame. The switch then sends the frame
out the port for that computer only.
This is A Good Thing. Instead of forcing all computers on the network to
listen while one Mac speaks (like a hub does) — known as half-duplex — a

Book V
Chapter 1
Setting Up a 
Small Network
What Do I Need to Set Up My Network?
489
switch can actually send the data directly to the only computer that needs
to hear it. This gets rid of the evil collisions, allowing all the computers to
speak and talk at the same time (full-duplex). Now, twice as much informa-
tion can be shoved around because a computer can now send and receive
data at the same time. This is a major breakthrough and can happen only on
a switch.
Just how much of a performance improvement do you get with a switch
compared with a hub? On average, you’ll move from a 100 Mbps hub that
can handle an average of 5 Mbps of traffic per device (assuming that eight
computers are communicating at once) to a 100 Mbps switch that can
handle 200 Mbps per device (no matter how many devices are connected).
That’s a speed increase of 4,000 percent, leading me to another inescapable
Mark’s Maxim:
Banish the hub, buy a switch for your network, and say goodbye to 
collisions!™
Cables
Cables are the ties that bind . . . literally. Cables are used to connect the NIC
card on each computer to the central hardware of the network: namely, hubs
(which you don’t really want) or switches (which you do want). With a little
experience, you’ll be a cable-wielding superhero with hundreds of feet of
cable draped across every piece of furniture in your place for your first LAN
party. (A LAN party, by the way, is when way too many techies bring their
computers into a very small space, connect them, and play games for 48
hours straight. Oh, and we eat a lot, too. Good stuff!)
Here’s the scoop on what kind of cables to use. Technically, you can run 10
Mbps Ethernet over Cat5 cable (like a super-version of the wire that you use
for your telephones). Some networks still use coaxial cable (the kind of
cable that you use to connect your TV to your cable service), but coaxial is
no longer used for home and small office networks like yours or mine. You
can run 100 Mbps Ethernet over Cat5 cable or fiber optic cable.
Although you can do 10/100 and most times 100 Mbps Ethernet over Cat5
cable, any new cables that you buy should be Cat5E or Cat6 — which I talk
about in the following section — because these types of cables are specifi-
cally meant for use with 1000 Mbps Ethernet.
I’m sure you noticed that the common denominator here is the Cat5 cable.
Although you could get by using coaxial cable, it’s pretty much gone out of
style as a network cable because it’s limited to 10 Mbps Ethernet. In fact, it’s
very hard to find a NIC with a coaxial connection any more. Fiber optic

Setting Up Your Network
490
cable, although supporting speeds of 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, and even 10 Gbps, is
much more expensive and more difficult to install.
Hey, did I mention that you can eschew cables entirely? For more informa-
tion on the lean, mean world of wireless networking, see Chapter 4 of this
mini-book.
Be sure to buy straight-through Cat5E/Cat6 cables (also called patch cables)
and not crossover cables, which are used only in certain circumstances.
Crossover cables are mainly used to connect two computers directly
together (to form a tiny, two-computer network), connect a cable/DSL
modem directly to a computer, or connect multiple switches.
Cat5 cable supports speeds of 100 Mbps. 1000 Mbps Ethernet, of course, is
designed to run ten times faster than that; luckily enough, it was engineered
to be compatible with 90 percent of Cat5 installations. Having said that,
some Cat5 cables don’t stick to the stringent specifications that 1000 Mbps
Ethernet requires. The newer version of Cat5 cable is Category 5 Enhanced,
or Cat5E for short. Cat5E is recommended for any new installation because it
can easily handle 10/100 Mbps Ethernet and yet can handle 1000 Mbps
Ethernet as well. Even if you’re using 10/100 Mbps Ethernet, you can upgrade
someday to 1000 Mbps without having to worry about upgrading your
cabling. You may also find Cat6 cabling in your network travels, which can
also easily handle 10/100/1000 Mbps speeds.
Setting Up Your Network
After you collect the hardware components I list earlier in this chapter,
you’re ready to connect things. Here’s a quick list of things to do to get your
network fired up:
1. Find the best location for placing your hub or switch.
To keep costs down, try to place the switch in a location close to a
power outlet that’s centrally located so that you can use the least
amount of cable. If cost isn’t an issue, hide the unit in a closet and just
run all the cables along the walls to the hub or switch. And if cost really
isn’t an issue, get your house fully wired with Cat5E cable.
2. Plug the hub or switch into the power socket.
Some hubs and switches come on automatically when you plug them in
and can never be turned off. Others have a power switch that you need
to turn on the first time that you plug them in.

3. Verify that the hub or switch is working by looking at the lights on the
front. Check the manual that came with the hub or switch to see what
light configuration is normal for that particular unit.
Until you have computers or printers attached to it, you might just have
a status light that shows the switch is powered on. But if the lights on
your unit don’t match up with what the manual says, you could have a
bum unit that you need to return.
4. Verify that all your devices are near enough to the hub or switch to be
connected by your cables and then turn them all on.
5. Get one of your Cat5E or Cat6 cables and connect one cable from the
Ethernet jack on your computer, usually on the side or back, to an
open port on the hub or switch.
You should see a link light or speed light come on that verifies that the
two devices sense each other. (You might also have a link light on your
NIC where you plug in the cable, but that depends on the Mac that
you’re using.)
6. Repeat Step 5 until each device is attached to the hub or switch.
Congratulations, you’re a network technician! (Don’t forget to call your
friends and brag.) The first phase of the network, the physical connection, is
complete; the next step is the configuration of Mac OS X.
Understanding the Basics of Network Configuration
Take a deep breath, there’s no need to panic — in fact, configuring your net-
work software basically involves entering a lot of numbers and other stuff in
dialogs. (In fact, most folks can just allow Leopard to take care of network
settings automatically.) But just so you’ll understand what’s involved, this
section explains what those numbers are, what they do, and why you ought
to know it. Because this is a Mac OS X book, I stick with configuring Macs
running the Big X.
TCP/IP
First things first: Protocol is just the techno-nerd word for a set of rules or a
language. A protocol is a language that computers use to communicate.
Without protocols, the computers on your network would never be able to
speak to each other even though you have NICs, cables, and a hub or a
switch. The Internet Protocol (IP) part of the TCP/IP suite is what you’re
really interested in because it’s the most important part of your network
configuration chore.

492
IP addresses
IP addresses are like street addresses for computers on a network. Each com-
puter on the network has an IP address, and it needs to be unique because
no other computer can share it. When a computer wants to communicate
with another computer, it can simply send the data on the network in a nice
package that has its address as well as the address of the computer that it’s
trying to talk to. (Remember frames? If not, take a refresher in the earlier
section, “Switches.”)
An IP address is just a number, but it’s written in a strange way. (Go figure.)
All IP addresses are written as four numbers between 0 and 255 with a dot
(period) between them: For instance, a common IP address that you might
run into is 192.168.0.1. As everyone knows, engineers can’t sleep unless they
have three or four ways to write the same thing, including IP addresses. The
form shown above — which is by far the most common — is dotted notation.
Each number, like 192, is an octet.
Don’t worry too much about this stuff: You don’t have to remember terms
like octet to create your own network. They could be helpful, however, if
something goes wrong and you need to place a call to tech support. Plus,
you can impress the computer salesperson (gleefully called a wonk by Mac
power users) at your local Maze ’o Wires store with your mastery of techno-
babble.
IP addresses at home versus on the Internet
One very important thing to keep in mind is that the Almighty IP Address
Police — Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (www.iana.org) — has
broken IP addresses into groups. The two main types of IP addresses are
public and private:
✦Public IP addresses can be used on the Internet and are unique through-
out the whole world.
✦Private IP addresses are used in homes or businesses and can’t be used
to talk to the public Internet. Private IP addresses are used over and
over by many people and most commonly take the form 192.168.x.x.
You’ll almost always get a public IP address from your Internet service
provider (ISP), whether you’re using a cable modem, digital subscriber line
(DSL), or a regular dialup modem. If you use a cable/DSL router or some-
thing like IPNetShareX to share your Internet connection among multiple
computers, you’ll be using private IP addresses on your network while using
a single public IP address to talk to the Internet (more on that in Chapter 5 of
this mini-book).

“Great! I get an IP address, put it into my Network settings in System
Preferences, and off I go. Right?” Well, you’re close, but here are a few other
pieces of information that you might need before you can go surfing around
the world:
✦Default gateway: When you send information to other networks —
whether in another building or around the world on the Internet — your
computer needs to know the IP address of the gateway that will forward
your data down the line. The default gateway is really just the IP address
of a router, which is a device that connects multiple networks. A gateway
gets its name because it really is your gateway to all other networks.
✦Subnet mask: A subnet mask is a number that helps your computer
know when it needs to send stuff through the router. It’s a group of four
octets with dots, just like an IP address, but almost always it uses 0 or
255 as the four octets. Most often, the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. If
the wrong number is entered for the subnet mask, it could keep you
from talking to the Internet or even computers on your own network.
Software applications
After you have the hardware in place and you’ve chosen and configured a
protocol to allow the computers to all talk to each other, you need software
to make use of your new network connections. Time for more good news: A
lot of the software that you need to move data on your network is included
already in Mac OS X! Here is a quick list of some of the network software and
protocols already built into Mac OS X and what they’re used for:
✦FTP: File Transfer Protocol (FTP), part of the TCP/IP protocol suite,
allows computers of any type — Mac, PC, Linux, UNIX, mainframe, or
whatever — to transfer files back and forth between them.
✦Telnet: Telnet is also part of the TCP/IP suite — you can use it to
remotely connect to a computer and execute commands on the remote
machine.
✦Samba: Samba, an open source software suite, enables Mac OS X users
to share files with people using Windows computers and also allows the
Mac user to connect to files that the Windows computers share.
✦HTTP: HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), also part of the TCP/IP suite,
is used by Web browsers to provide access to all the various pages on
the World Wide Web.

Leave it to Leopard to provide you with assistance — in this case, when you
first open the Network pane, you might be greeted with a dialog offering you
assistance on setting up the stuff I cover in this section. (Whether you get
this absolutely free offer of aid depends on whether you upgraded your Mac
from a previous version of Mac OS X, or whether you entered your network
and Internet settings within the Leopard Setup Assistant.) If you do decide to
allow the Leopard Internet/Network assistant to guide you through your net-
work setup, I’ll meet back up with you at the next section.
Using DHCP for automatic IP address assignment
Now I’d like to introduce you to a very dear friend of mine — an abbrevia-
tion that you will soon grow to love, like everyone else who’s set up a small
Mac network. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, or DHCP for short, is a
protocol that enables a computer to automatically get all the information
that I’ve talked about to this point. (Check in your Webster’s . . . this is the
very definition of the word godsend.)
You’re saying, “Mark, there’s gotta be a catch, right?” Well, here’s the bad
news: Before you can use DHCP, you have to first add a DHCP server, which
provides other computers on the network with their configuration settings.
Here’s the good news: Most Internet connection-sharing hardware devices
(and software-sharing implementations as well) provide a DHCP server as
part of the price of admission. (Internet connection sharing allows all your
networked computers to access the Internet through a single Internet con-
nection. I cover it more in Chapter 5 of this mini-book.) Most switches can
provide DHCP services these days . . . technology marches on.
If you plan to use Internet connection sharing or you know that you have a
DHCP server on your network, you can set up your Mac to automatically
obtain the required IP address and information. Open System Preferences
from the Dock or the Apple menu and choose Network. From the Network
dialog that appears, click the Show pop-up menu and select Built-in Ethernet.
Choose Using DHCP from the Configure IPv4 pop-up menu on the TCP/IP tab.
Click the Apply Now button, and Mac OS X contacts the DHCP server to
obtain an IP address, a subnet mask, a gateway router IP address, and a
Domain Name System (DNS) address. (DNS servers convert a human-friendly
address, like www.yahoo.com, to a computer-friendly IP address, like
66.218.71.86.)
A few seconds after clicking the Apply Now button, you should see the infor-
mation come up, as provided by the DHCP server. This lets you know that
the process worked, and configuration is complete. You might also notice
that the DNS Servers information is empty — fear not, Mac OS X is really
using DNS information provided by the DHCP server. Press Ô+Q to quit
System Preferences and save your settings.

If you ever make a network change that screws things up, like entering the
wrong subnet mask or an IP address that isn’t in the same range as others 
on your LAN, you can always click the Revert button to get back your old
settings.
One DHCP server on a network is princely, but two or more DHCP servers on
a single network will fight like alley cats and grind everything to a halt.
Therefore, if you’re considering adding a DHCP server to an existing net-
work, make doggone sure that you’re not treading on another server’s toes.
(Ask that network administrator person.)
Manually choosing an IP address range
You say you don’t have a DHCP server, and you need to manually assign 
IP addresses? This configuration means two things: You need to manually
configure the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
Properties. Keep in mind that for now, you’re not concerned with the
Internet — just computers on the local network.
A result of being on a local network — because it’s not connected to the
Internet, it’s also called a private network — is that you must use IP
addresses that are reserved for private network use. You can use a few dif-
ferent ranges of IP addresses, but I recommend that you choose an address
range from the 192.168.x.x networks. In the next section, I show you how.
Down to business: I recommend that you use IP addresses in the 192.168.x.x
range. What does this mean exactly? Well, here’s the scoop:
✦Use IP addresses where the first two octets are 192 and 168 (192.168).
Octet numbers are conjoined by periods.
✦For the third octet, select any number between 1 and 254.
It doesn’t matter which one you choose as long as you use this same
third number on all computers on your network.
✦For the fourth octet, select any number between 1 and 254.
Make sure that every computer on your local network has a different
fourth octet number. This is very important — your network doesn’t
work otherwise.
✦Use 255.255.255.0 as your subnet mask.
For instance, suppose that you’re using three computers on your network.
All the IP addresses that you use will start with 192.168. Next, suppose you
choose 123 for the third octet. (Remember that you can choose any number
between 1 and 254.) Finally, for the fourth octet, choose the numbers 100,

Configuring Network System Preferences
496
105, and 110 for the three computers, respectively. (Again, you can choose
any numbers between 1 and 254.) The resulting IP addresses used on the
three computers are
192.168.123.100
192.168.123.105
192.168.123.110
By the way, I should mention that there are other range possibilities for
reserved private networks — AirPort and AirPort Extreme hardware uses a
10.x.x.x network range, for example — but the 192.168.x.x range is definitely
the most popular and the most common default on Ethernet network 
hardware.
After you know the IP addresses and the subnet mask that you’re going to
use, start setting up each computer. Being a nice guy, I walk you through the
process of configuring Mac OS X with the 192.168.123.105 address as an
example.
Be sure that you have all the physical portion of your network powered up
and connected as I outline in the earlier section, “Setting Up Your Network.”
1. Select any of your Macs to start with and open System Preferences
(either from the Apple menu or from the Dock).
2. From the System Preferences dialog, choose Network.
The Network pane appears.
3. Click Built-in Ethernet in the list.
4. Click the Configure pop-up menu and choose Manually.
Figure 1-1 shows how things should look at this point.
5. Enter the IP address for this machine (192.168.123.105 in this 
example) in the IP Address text box.
6. Enter the subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 in the Subnet Mask text box.
7. Click the Apply button, and your new network settings take effect.
8. Press Ô+Q to quit System Preferences.
Repeat this same procedure with the other IP addresses for each of the
other Macs that are connected to your network.
Most ISPs also supply DNS server addresses and search domains. If your ISP
included DNS server addresses or search domains, don’t forget to type them
into the corresponding boxes on the TCP/IP panel.

Verifying Connectivity
After you have your Macs connected and your TCP/IP configuration is done,
check to make sure that everything is working. After you have at least two
computers on your network, each with a TCP/IP address, you can use a
simple little utility called ping to test the connection.
ping is a very simple, yet extremely helpful, utility that’s the first connectiv-
ity-testing tool out of the box, even for network professionals. When you use
the ping utility — referred to as pinging something — the application sends
out a small packet of data to whatever destination you’re trying to reach.
When the receiving computer hears the ping, it answers with a ping reply. If
the original computer receives the ping reply, you know that the connection
between the computers is good.
To ping a computer, you use a little application built in to Mac OS X called
Network Utility, which allows you to work various network wonders (includ-
ing checking connectivity, watching the route that your computer takes to
get to another computer, and looking up information about Internet domain
names). To use Network Utility to check network connectivity, follow these
steps:
1. Open a Finder window, click Applications, and click Utilities.
2. Double-click the Network Utility icon to launch the application.
3. Click the Ping tab (see Figure 1-2).
Figure 1-1:
Manually

settings.

Verifying Connectivity
498
4. In the Please Enter the Network Address to Ping text field, enter the
IP address of the computer that you want to ping.
5. To simply verify connectivity, select the Send Only x Pings radio
button and enter a low number, such as 5, in the text field.
Five or ten pings are plenty to see whether the connection is good.
6. Click the Ping button.
Your Mac sends ping packets to the IP address that you entered.
If the pings are successful, text appears in the text box at the bottom of the
Ping tab: one line for each ping reply received from the other computer. The
end of each line reads time= with a number at the end. That number is the
amount of time, in ƒ1⁄1000 of a second (milliseconds [ms]), that it took for the
ping packet to go from your computer to the other computer and back.
If your ping is unsuccessful, you see nothing, at least for a little bit. Each
ping that you send takes two seconds before it’s considered missing in
action. So, if you choose five pings, wait ten seconds before you see the
results. After all the pings time out — a ping times out when it doesn’t get
returned in the proper amount of time — you see a line of text appear that
reads ping: sendto: No route to host or 100% packet loss. Both error
messages mean the same thing: All the ping packets that you sent out are
now in the packet graveyard, never to be seen again. As you’ve likely
guessed already, this is not a good sign for your network connectivity. Look
ahead to the section “Troubleshooting Your New Network” in this chapter to
find out where to begin troubleshooting this problem.

If you can ping all the other computers on your network from one of the
computers, you don’t need to go to each computer and ping all the others.
You can logically assume that all the computers can communicate. For
instance, if you can ping computers B, C, and D from computer A, you don’t
need to bother with ping tests from computer B, C, or D.
After you have your computers configured and you’ve verified connectivity
between them, start doing the fun stuff that a network allows you to do, like
sharing data, printing, and (most importantly) playing games with users on
other computers.
Troubleshooting Your New Network
After a network is set up and operating, it rarely has problems — still,
Murphy sometimes takes charge, and the darn thing just won’t work right.
When you do have problems with the network, I recommend using a stan-
dard, consistent approach to finding and fixing the problem. This section
breaks down troubleshooting into two areas:
✦The hardware: The best place to start troubleshooting a network prob-
lem is with the actual equipment, such as the NICs, cables, and
hubs/switches. (See earlier sections on each equipment type.)
✦The software: The second place to check for problems is in the configu-
ration of the computers on the network, specifically the configuration on
the computer(s) having the problem that you’re troubleshooting.
Physical problems with your network
Although many things on a network can go bad or cause problems, usually
network problems are caused by faulty equipment or wiring. Sometimes it’s
something as simple as a cable not being plugged in snugly. Looking at the
physical cables, connections, and equipment is always the best place to
start looking for problems. Here is a quick list of physical things to check
while trying to fix network problems:
1. Make sure that both ends of the network cable are firmly connected.
First check the end that plugs into the computer and then check the end
that connects to the hub/switch.
2. Turn on the problematic computer to be sure that it’s connected to a
hub or switch.

Troubleshooting Your New Network
500
Check the port on the hub/switch to see whether the link/speed light is
lit. (Depending on the hub or switch that you have, you might not have a
link light. Many hubs and switches use a speed light to indicate a link.
Check the manufacturer’s manual for your model.) If your computer is
on and connected but no link/speed light is lit, try replacing the network
cable.
3. If you replace the network cable and there still isn’t light, try unplug-
ging the cable from the hub/switch and plug it into another port.
Choose one of the other computers connected to the hub/switch that
works, unplug it, and plug the broken computer into that port for test-
ing. Occasionally, a single port on a hub or switch goes bad; if that hap-
pens, just mark it as bad and don’t use it anymore. But if all computers
connected to the hub/switch stop working, it’s probably the hub or
switch that’s gone south. If the hub/switch is still under warranty, I rec-
ommend getting it fixed or replaced.
4. If you replace the cable, try a different port on the hub, and if other
computers work fine on that hub/switch, the NIC inside your com-
puter has possibly gone bad.
If you reach this determination, call your local service center to have it
looked at and repaired. If you have an older model where the NIC was
added instead of built in, you can simply replace the NIC yourself.
The key when troubleshooting physical problems is the link/speed light on
the hub or switch. If the link/speed light still doesn’t work, the problem isn’t
likely a physical problem. Start troubleshooting the network configuration
on the computer itself.
Network configuration problems
After checking the physical layer, look for problems in the network settings.
When using TCP/IP on your network, look for these specific things: the
TCP/IP configuration mode, IP address, subnet mask, and router IP address
(if you’re using a router to connect to the Internet or other networks). To
check these settings, choose AppleÍSystem PreferencesÍNetwork to bring up
the Network dialog.
1. Make sure that the Configuration pop-up menu on the TCP/IP
Properties tab is set to the appropriate option.
• Using DHCP: Select the Using DHCP option only if you’re using a
cable/DSL modem/router or other DHCP server. Otherwise, set this
to Manually.

Book V
Chapter 1
Setting Up a 
Small Network
Troubleshooting Your New Network
501
• Manually: If the configuration is set to Manually, check the IP
Address, DNS Servers, Router, and Subnet Mask fields to make sure
that they’re correct. If you’re not sure whether your Subnet Mask
field entry is correct, you can usually make it the same as other com-
puters on the same network with you. Most times, the subnet mask is
255.255.255.0.
2. To check your Internet connectivity to the rest of the Internet, try
pinging www.apple.com.
This checks the router and DNS settings.
3. If you’re set up for DHCP and your TCP/IP settings remain blank,
make sure that your DHCP server — which could be your cable/DSL
modem/router — is turned on and working properly.

H
ere’s one of those incredibly complex concepts that you always find in
these computer books: After you have your network all set up and
ready to go, you can do all kinds of things with it. (Now wasn’t that utterly
painless?) You can use your network to share files, share printers, remotely
control your Mac, or even play multi-user games, like Call of Duty 2 — my
favorite — against other friends. To keep your files safe from unwanted
snoops, you can configure the Mac OS X built-in firewall. In this chapter, I
cover the basics of file sharing, sharing printers, and using the firewall to
protect yourself from intruders.
It’s All about (File) Sharing
One of the main reasons for building a network is sharing files between com-
puters. You might even want to set up a server, which is a computer with
shared files that are always available to anyone on the network. Think of a
server as a common file storage area for the rest of the network. Really, any
computer that shares files is technically a server because it’s serving, so to
speak. But usually most people only use the word server to mean a com-
puter that’s dedicated solely to serving files, printers, and so on for the rest
of the network.
Creating an account
Sharing files on your Mac with other Mac users is a piece of cake.
Remember, however, that you need to create an account for anyone whom
you want to have access to your files. The accounts that you create can only
access two folders, as shown in Figure 2-1:

It’s All about (File) Sharing
504
✦The account’s Home folder: That specific account’s Home folder carries
a short version of the username that’s in the Users folder on your hard
drive. Figure 2-1 shows the Home folder, which is noted with an icon that
looks like a house, for the chambers account (where chambers is the
short account name for Mark Chambers). The Home folder icon always
bears the short account name for the user who’s currently logged in.
✦The Shared folder: This folder is also in the Users folder on your hard
drive. Anyone with an account on your Mac can access the Shared
folder, so it’s a great place to keep common files that everyone wants to
copy or use.
By the way, here’s a quick note about the drive names that you see in these
figures. I’ve never liked that rather mundane Macintosh HD moniker, and as 
I mention elsewhere in the book, I’m a huge (okay, really huge) fan of 
Mozart — hence the drive name Disk Wolfgang. My other drive is an external
FireWire drive where I keep all beta builds of upcoming Mac OS X versions . . .
and it’s thoughtfully named FireWire Drive. (Technology authors can be
somewhat eccentric; chalk it up to our techno-nerd beginnings. On the other
hand, we never type e-mail messages in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS. That’s con-
sidered shouting, you know.)
To create an account, you need to be logged in as an Admin user. Follow
these steps:

1. Open System Preferences from the Apple menu (Ô) or the Dock.
2. Click Accounts under the System section.
4. Click the New Account button, which carries a plus sign.
3. Fill in the appropriate information, including the name for the
account and a password.
Note that the name that appears as the short name determines the name
of that user’s Home folder.
5. Click Create Account.
6. Press Ô+Q to exit System Preferences.
I cover creating accounts in greater detail in Book II, Chapter 5, but that’s the
short version.
Enabling file sharing
When you enable file sharing, your files are exchanged over Transmission
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and/or AppleTalk, depending on
which protocols you’ve enabled. (To enable AppleTalk for compatibility with
older Macs on your network, see Chapter 3 in this mini-book.)
Regardless of which protocol you use to share your files, follow these steps
to turn on sharing:
1. Open System Preferences either from the Apple menu or from the
Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon to open the Sharing Preferences panel.
3. Select the File Sharing check box to enable it.
Connecting to a shared resource
At the top of the Sharing panel, you can see that other Macintosh users can
access your computer at afp://<ip address>, where ip address is the
IP address for your specific computer. When another Mac user wants to con-
nect to your shared files, that person can do the following:
1. Choose Go➪Connect to Server from the Finder menu.
2. After the Connect to Server dialog opens, other Mac users can type
afp://<ip address> (where ip address is the IP address of your
Macintosh) and then click the Connect button.

Sharing a Connected Printer
506
You can also browse for a shared resource on the Connect to Server dialog.
Choose Go➪Connect to Server or press Ô+K. Click Browse to locate the
shared computer. Note that you might be prompted to choose whether you
want to connect as a Guest or a Registered User. To connect to the server as
a Registered User, you must supply the right username and password. If you
connect as Guest, you don’t have to supply a password, but you will have
restricted access to only the Public folder for each account on the system
that you connect to. If you need to connect as a Registered User, ask an
Admin user who controls that Mac to supply you with the correct username
and password.
Give the username and password that you created to the person using the
other Mac, and he can now access files in that account’s Home folder as well
as any other Public folders on your computer.
The updated sidebar that appears in Finder windows offers a Shared 
heading — click the arrow next to Shared to display other shared resources
on your network, just as if you had clicked Browse from the Connect to
Server dialog. (I’m starting to think Leopard might be a synonym for 
convenience.)
Sharing a Connected Printer
Sharing your printer for others to use is one of the best reasons to have a
network. Setting up your Mac to share your printer is very easy under Mac
OS X. Here’s a quick rundown of what you need to do:
1. Open System Preferences from the Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon under the Internet & Network section to open
the Sharing Preferences dialog.
3. Click the Printer Sharing check box to enable it.
By default, when you turn on Printer Sharing, Leopard automatically
shares all the current printers connected to your Mac. To select which
printers can be used for shared printing, click the Print & Fax icon in
System Preferences. From this pane, you can enable and disable sharing
on individual printers.
After Printer Sharing is enabled, follow these steps to connect to that printer
from other computers on your network:
1. Click System Preferences on the Dock.
2. Click the Print & Fax icon.
3. Click the Add button (which carries a plus sign).

507
You might be prompted to add a printer automatically when the Printer
Setup Utility opens. Click the Add button to begin the addition. (For
more on adding a printer with the Printer Setup Utility, see Book VI,
Chapter 4.)
4. From the Browser window that opens, click the IP Printing button on
the toolbar.
5. Enter the IP address of the Macintosh that’s connected to the target
printer and then click the Add button.
Already have the Printer Browser open? Then follow the easier path: Clicking
the Default toolbar button displays all the available local shared printers.
Click the desired printer and then click Add.
You can also click the More Printers toolbar button to select a printer using
Bonjour. Click the pop-up menu at the top of the dialog and choose Bonjour to
automatically recognize printers on your local network. Shared printers just
appear in your Printer List automatically. It doesn’t get any easier than that!
Sharing Files with Windows Computers
If you’ve deigned to allow PCs running Windows on your network (a gener-
ous gesture to the lower classes), you’ll probably want to also share files
with those computers. Sharing files with a Windows PC — actually a
Windows user — is very similar to sharing files with other Mac users.
File sharing must be enabled, as I demonstrated earlier in this chapter (when
you share with other Macs, you’re also making those files available to PCs).
To allow file sharing with Windows computers, follow these steps:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon to open the Sharing Preferences pane.
3. Click the File Sharing entry.
4. Click the Advanced button.
5. Click the user account (or accounts) that will be accessible by
Windows PCs.
Leopard will growl while you try to enable SMB sharing — that’s because
you have to enable Windows access on the desired account before it can
be used. Leopard prompts you for your password, smugly informing you
that the account password will be stored “in a less secure manner.” (Take
that, Mr. Gates!) Generally, this isn’t a problem, but never enable an
account for Windows access unless trusted individuals will use it.

Accessing File Shares on Windows Computers
508
6. Click the Share files and folders using SMB check box to enable it.
7. Click Done to exit the Advanced dialog, and close the System
Preferences window to save the changes.
Accessing File Shares on Windows Computers
If you allow a Windows PC to access your files, you’ll also probably want to
putter around with files on a Windows PC. Easy!
Accessing files on Windows computers relies on the Samba component 
(a part of the UNIX foundation of Mac OS X). Follow these steps:
1. Choose Go➪Connect to Server from the Finder.
The Connect to Server dialog opens.
2. In the Address box, enter smb://<ip address>, where ip address is the
IP address of the Windows computer that you want to connect to.
3. Click the Connect button.
Depending on the type of account you have on the Windows PC, Mac OS
X might display an SMB (Server Message Block) authentication dialog in
which you can enter your username and password. (Think security for
the Windows crowd.)
4. Select the desired shared drive to mount from the pop-up menu.
5. Mount the shared drive according to the Windows version:
✦If you’re accessing a file shared on a Windows 95 or Windows 98 com-
puter: Simply click OK to mount the share.
✦If you’re accessing a file shared on a Windows NT, 2000, XP or Vista 
computer: Click the Authenticate button. Then enter your username 
and password, click OK, and then click OK again to mount the share.
After you mount the shared drive, you’ll see it appear on your Desktop, just
like a Mac volume. You can use this drive just like any other drive on your
system. To disconnect from the Windows share, you can

when you start dragging).

Using FTP to Access Files
509
Using FTP to Access Files
FTP is part of the TCP/IP protocol suite — the hoary acronym FTP stands for
File Transfer Protocol. FTP is one of the oldest methods for sharing files
between computers; however, because it’s part of the TCP/IP protocol suite,
it can be used on many different kinds of computers, including those running
just about any type of strange and arcane operating system. You can still
manage to exchange files regardless of whether you’re using Mac OS X,
Windows, Linux, or UNIX. (Heck, even dinosaurs like DOS can join the party.)
FTP is a client/server application. In plain English, this means that two pieces
make things tick: the server (which hosts the connection, rather like a file
server) and the client (which connects to the server). Mac OS X, thanks to
its UNIX foundation, has both an FTP server and client built in. To use FTP,
you need a computer running the FTP server software to give others access
to files; then the other computer, or client, can connect to the FTP server.
After the connection is made, the client can either send files to the server
(uploading) or get files from the server (downloading). In this section, I
cover how to use FTP to give others access to your files as well as talk about
the FTP applications that come with Mac OS X.
Using the Mac OS X built-in FTP to share files
One way to give others access to your files is to run an FTP server on your
Mac. Mac OS X comes with an FTP server built in, so you just have to acti-
vate it. You might wonder why you’d use FTP to share files when you can use
Personal File Sharing or Windows File Sharing. The main advantage to FTP is
compatibility: Not only can people on your LAN access files, but anyone on
the Internet can also access your files, regardless of the type of machine that
they’re using.
Using FTP on the Internet
Because File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a part
of the TCP/IP suite, it works on virtually every
type of computer (over both the Internet and
your local area network). So, assuming that you
have your computer connected to the Internet
through a modem or a local area network (LAN)
connection, everything that I discuss about FTP
and how to use it applies to connecting to FTP
servers on the Internet as well. When you con-
nect to FTP servers on the Internet, you can use
the Fully Qualified Domain Name (or FQDN for
short), like ftp.apple.com instead of an
actual IP address. You can also use the FTP
server in Mac OS X to make files available to
friends on the Internet just as you would to
make them available on a LAN.

Using FTP to Access Files
510
Just like with the other file-sharing methods, you need to create a user
account on your computer before someone can connect to and get files from
your Mac. After you have accounts created for the users, you can enable FTP
sharing like this:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon to open the Sharing Preferences pane.
3. Click the File Sharing entry.
4. Click the Advanced button.
5. Click the Share files and folders using FTP check box to enable it.
Always helpful, Leopard reminds you on the Advanced sheet that people
can use ftp://<ip address>, where ip address is the IP address of
your Mac.
6. Click Done to exit the Advanced dialog, and close the System
Preferences window to save the changes.
If you’re using an AirPort/AirPort Extreme Base Station or other cable/
digital subscriber line (DSL) router to share your Internet connection, 
place the Mac that you want people on the Internet to access in a DMZ, or
demilitarized zone. Check your cable/DSL router documentation for more
information.
Using FTP from Terminal to transfer files
You can use FTP to transfer files with an FTP server by using the command
line interface (CLI); to use the CLI, open a Terminal, or shell, session. To use
a Terminal session, click the Terminal icon in the Utilities folder inside the
Applications folder. When you open a Terminal session, you’re presented
with a window that accepts text commands. You’ll see a prompt that con-
sists of your computer’s name and the folder that you’re currently in, 
followed by your user ID. It’s at this prompt where you type various FTP
commands.
After you’re in the Terminal session, you’ll use a series of commands to 
connect to another computer, move in and out of folders, and transfer files.
Following is a list of the basic commands that you need to use FTP as well as
a brief description of what each command does.
✦ftp: This command starts the FTP command line interface session. You
can tell that you’re in the FTP client application when you see ftp> as
your command prompt. This is where you type all other FTP commands
to do things.

Book V
Chapter 2
Using Your Network
Using FTP to Access Files
511
✦open: This command is used to start your connection to another 
computer. Type this command followed by the IP address of the FTP
server that you want to connect to.
✦ls: Use this command to see a listing of all files and folders in the 
current folder on the FTP server.
✦cd: This command allows you to change the folder that you’re in. Type
cd <folder> (where folder is a specific folder name) to move into a
subfolder on the FTP server. Type cd .. (that’s c, d, space, and two peri-
ods) to go back out a folder level.
✦lcd: This command acts exactly like cd except that it changes the folder
that you’re currently in on your local system, not the FTP server. Use
this command to put yourself in the folder on the local drive that you
want to transfer files to and from.
✦bin: Type this command to get in binary mode to transfer files that
aren’t plain-text files. (Always use binary mode unless you’re specifically
transferring plain-text files.)
✦ascii: This command puts you in ASCII mode for transferring text files.
✦get or mget: To retrieve a single file, use the get command followed by
the filename of the file that you want to retrieve. If you want to get multi-
ple files at once, use the mget command followed by a filename contain-
ing * and/or ? as wildcards.
✦put or mput: To send a single file, use the put command followed by 
the filename to send a file to the FTP server. To send multiple files, use
the mput command followed by a filename containing * and/or ? as
wildcards.
✦quit: Use the quit command to end your FTP session.
To end a Terminal session and exit Terminal at any time, press Ô+Q.
Terminal prompts you for confirmation if necessary.
Many FTP servers will only let you send files to certain folders. Most times
this folder is named Upload, Uploads, or something similar.
Using these commands will enable you to exchange files with an FTP server.
Here’s an example of how to use these commands within the Terminal
window:
1. Type ftp to get into FTP mode.
2. Type open <ip address> to open your connection to the FTP server.

Using the Built-in Firewall
512
3. At this point, you’re asked for a username and password.
For many FTP servers, using the username anonymous and your e-mail
address as the password is enough to get you logged in. Some sites even
allow you to log in without any username or password at all. On secure
sites, however, you must use an assigned username and password pro-
vided by the administrator of that particular server.
4. Use the lcd <folder> (where folder is a specific folder name) com-
mand to change into the folder on your local drive that you want files
to come to/from.
5. Use the ls and cd commands to place yourself into the desired folder
on the FTP server.
6. Use the ascii or bin commands to set your file transfer mode to
ASCII or binary, respectively.
This is important because choosing the wrong type will likely cause the
transfer to fail. Unless it’s a plain-text file, always use binary mode.
7. Use the get/mget/put/mput commands to send or receive the
desired files.
8. Use the quit command to close the connection and exit the FTP 
session.
Using the Built-in Firewall
A firewall watches all the network communications coming into your Mac —
it automatically plays the role of security guard, blocking or denying certain
network traffic that you want to avoid from reaching your Mac. It acts as
another layer of security to help keep you safe from unwanted attacks.
That’s all well and good, but you must be careful to set up your firewall cor-
rectly before you turn it on: A configuration mistake could make your Mac
inaccessible from the network.
For instance, if you want to enable FTP access on your Mac but you also
want to keep all other traffic from coming into your Mac, you can tell the
built-in firewall to only allow FTP traffic. The firewall on the Mac will only
block or allow TCP/IP traffic — not AppleTalk — so AppleTalk traffic (which
is always from your local network and not the Internet anyway) can always
get in.
When enabled, the firewall blocks all traffic that comes into your Mac. By
default, however, the firewall is turned off. So, your first job is to enable the
firewall, by following these steps:

Book V

513
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
2. Click the Security icon.
3. Click the Firewall tab to show the settings that you see in Figure 2-2.
4. Click the Limit Incoming Connections to Specific Services and
Applications radio button to enable it.
This enables the firewall. And, by default, all incoming TCP/IP traffic is
blocked. You must enable each sharing method that you want to be able to
use. When you enable different sharing methods from the Sharing pane in
System Preferences (such as Personal File Sharing or FTP Access), you’ll
notice that those types of traffic now appear in the Firewall list. (In other
words, when you turn on a sharing method, the firewall automatically 
allows traffic for that sharing method, which Leopard calls a service. 
Most excellent.)
Click the up/down arrow icon to the right of any service to specify whether
the firewall should allow all connections, or just connections from others on
your local network.
Sometimes, you might want to allow other traffic through your firewall that
isn’t on the firewall list of recognized services and applications. At that
point, you can click the Add button to specify the application that your fire-
wall should allow . . . Leopard presents you with the familiar Add dialog, and
you can choose the application that needs access.

Remote Control of Your Mac
514
Remote Control of Your Mac
Forgive me whilst I wax techno-nerd here: One of the coolest advantages to a
network is the ability to take control of one computer from another com-
puter. For example, sometimes you might need to access files on your Mac
while you’re on a trip, but you don’t have File Sharing enabled. What can you
do? You can remotely connect into your Mac and then — just as if you were
sitting in front of it — enable File Sharing (as I demonstrate earlier in the
chapter). Perhaps you have a file on your computer with someone’s phone
number that you suddenly need on the road — with remote control, it’s at
your fingertips! (Sigh . . . ah, technology.)
Using Screen Sharing
Leopard’s new Screen Sharing feature, which is available from iChat, can be
turned on for individual users from the Sharing pane in System Preferences.
You can allow access for all user accounts on your Mac, or limit remote
access to only selected users. Screen Sharing is Apple’s implementation of
VNC technology.
To set up Screen Sharing, follow these steps:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon to open the Sharing Preferences pane.
3. Click the Screen Sharing check box to enable it.
4. To limit remote access for specific accounts, click the Only these users
radio button, and click the Add button (which bears a plus sign) to
select a user.
5. Close the System Preferences window to save the change.
Once you’ve enabled screen sharing, you can use the Buddies ➪Share My
Screen menu item in iChat to share your screen with another person. To
view another person’s screen, use the Buddies ➪Share Remote Screen menu
item. (For the details on iChat and Screen Sharing, see Book IV, Chapter 3.)
Remotely control your Mac (for free, no less!)
Virtual Network Computer (or VNC, available for many platforms at
www.realvnc.com) is a very nice application that enables you to remotely
control a computer from pretty much anywhere that has an Internet connec-
tion. VNC is easy to install and configure, but the best feature is that it’s free.
VNC can run on many different platforms, ranging from Windows XP and

Book V
Chapter 2
Using Your Network
Remote Control of Your Mac
515
UNIX on desktop computers and servers to Palm OS and Windows CE on 
personal digital assistants (PDAs). Wrap your mind around this: You could
be at a friend’s house on her wireless network and use your PDA to remotely
control your Mac at home over the Internet. Pure, undiluted sassy!
Some networks have proxies and firewalls that might interfere with VNC’s
operation. You can remotely control a computer that’s behind a firewall or
cable/DSL router, but the firewall/router needs to be configured properly.
Because the process varies from one manufacturer to the next, check your
cable/DSL router manual for instructions on how to do this.
How VNC works
In a nutshell, VNC takes the graphical interface on your monitor, turns it into
data, and sends it to the computer that you’re using to remotely control it.
The computer that you’re using sends keyboard presses, mouse movements,
and clicks to it, acting just the same way it would if you were sitting right in
front of it.
As I mentioned earlier, you can use Leopard’s new Screen Sharing feature in
iChat to make a remote connection from another Mac to your Mac. However,
you’re not limited to using just another Mac using Leopard and Screen
Sharing in iChat — you can control your Mac from a Windows PC, or from an
older version of Mac OS X as well! If you’ve already enabled Screen Sharing
(as I demonstrated earlier), follow these steps to enable any VNC connection:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon to open the Sharing Preferences pane.
3. Click the Screen Sharing entry.
4. Click the Computer Settings button.
5. Click the VNC viewers may control screen with password check box to
enable it.
6. Click within the password text box and enter a password for VNC
applications.
7. Click OK to exit the Computer Settings sheet, and close the System
Preferences window to save the changes.
Macs running Panther or Tiger can use the version of VNC called Share My
Desktop (SMD), which is available for download at
www.bombich.com/software/smd.html

Remote Control of Your Mac
516
There you’ll find instructions on how to install and set up SMD. Figure 2-3
shows a screenshot of a Mac running SMD under Mac OS X Tiger being
remotely controlled from a computer running Windows 98. (Yes, I know, it’s a
travesty, but then again sometimes you’ve just gotta use what you’ve got.)
Mr. Paranoia speaks again: Make doggone sure that you set up the pass-
word access correctly for SMD or don’t run it! I can’t stress enough how
much fun a hacker would have with free remote control over your Mac OS X
Desktop.
Remote control of another computer from your Mac
A few different VNC viewers exist for Mac OS X. A VNC viewer is just an appli-
cation you use to remotely control your computer running VNC. You can
download them at www.realvnc.com/download.html. If you find yourself
on a computer without a VNC viewer — heaven forbid — VNC server actu-
ally runs over the Web as well! As long as the computer that you’re using 
has a Web browser that supports Java — which Safari and Internet Explorer
do — you can still remotely control your computer.

When you connect to the computer running VNC using a Web browser, the
Web server sends a default page that contains a Java applet. That Java
applet asks you for the password to connect; upon entering the correct 
password, it brings up the remote control session right in the Web browser.
Good golly, Molly!

Need AppleTalk
In This Chapter
 Connecting to a legacy AppleTalk network
 Configuring the AppleTalk network preferences
 Using Mac OS X to access AppleTalk resources
W
hen emoting concerning networking and Macs, I’d be terribly remiss
for not discussing AppleTalk, which is the so-called “archaic” com-
munications protocol created years ago by Apple. AppleTalk allows a net-
work of Macs to share files and printers; before the arrival of an Ethernet
port, AppleTalk was the cat’s meow for connecting Macs. AppleTalk is still
used in environments like offices and college campuses. However, AppleTalk
is now disappearing from the corporate world because it simply cannot
scale (that’s administrator-speak for grow) to handle large networks like
standard Ethernet and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
(TCP/IP) can.
Although Apple finally made the move to TCP/IP as its primary network 
protocol — like the rest of the civilized world — Apple still includes support
for AppleTalk in Mac OS X Leopard, but it’s disabled by default. About the
only time when you might need to use AppleTalk is if you find yourself trying
to access an existing AppleTalk network (which is practically the definition
of the phrase rare occurrence) . . . but hey, I like to cover everything in a
desktop reference. Therefore, in this chapter, I show you how to enable the
AppleTalk protocol on your Mac as well as how to access files and printers
on a network that’s running AppleTalk.
Setting Up AppleTalk
Just like most network configuration tasks under the Big X, configuring your
Mac to use AppleTalk and play well with others in an AppleTalk network
isn’t very difficult. In this section, I talk about how to configure the settings
in the Network pane of System Preferences so that you can join the file 
sharing and network printing party.

Setting Up AppleTalk
520
You can configure AppleTalk on Mac OS X in two ways: manually or automat-
ically. I’ll bet you could see this Mark’s Maxim coming from a mile away:
Automatic is always good.™
Unless you’re given specific AppleTalk settings by a network administrator, I
highly recommend using the automatic AppleTalk configuration. However, I
cover both methods in this chapter just to be on the safe side. (That’s just
the kind of guy I am.)
Automatically configuring AppleTalk
To automatically configure AppleTalk, follow these steps.
1. Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu (Ú) or the Dock.
2. From the System Preferences window, click Network to open the
Network Preferences pane.
3. Click the Built-in Ethernet entry (or the connection you’re currently
using) from the list at the left side of the pane.
A word about Zones
Did you notice the AppleTalk Zone pop-up
menu on the AppleTalk settings page? (Stick
with me here, things are going to get techni-
cally flamboyant for a few sentences, but it
can’t be helped.) Zones are logical groupings of
computers that an AppleTalk network adminis-
trator creates for ease of use. For example,
consider a large company that employs many
graphic artists: This company has many build-
ings, but because of how the business has
grown, the graphic artists are spread between
several different locations in different buildings.
An AppleTalk network administrator would likely
have created a Graphics Zone that contains all
the Macs and servers and printers that make
up the graphics department; this way, the
artists can get to files on servers or print to
printers that are meant for them simply by put-
ting themselves in the Graphics Zone. This
works as a handy way to keep people who are
physically separate logically grouped into a
common area, or Zone. (Think of Zones as a
convenience thing — they don’t help your
system performance.)
When you configure AppleTalk, you might or
might not need to set the AppleTalk Zone. If
you’re on a network in which the administrator
has configured AppleTalk Zones, you’ll see a
list of all the Zones by clicking the AppleTalk
Zone pop-up menu; from there, simply select
the name of the Zone that you want to partici-
pate in. If you’re on a network in which no
Zones are configured, the AppleTalk Zone pop-
up menu will be grayed out and unavailable —
and if you can’t choose a Zone anyway, don’t
worry about it. (In other words, don’t let your
lack of AppleTalk Zones spoil that upcoming trip
to Vegas.)

4. Click the Advanced button.
5. Click the AppleTalk tab to display the AppleTalk settings page.
6. Enable the Make AppleTalk Active check box and then click the OK
button.
7. Click the Apply button.
Mac OS X defaults to using the automatic AppleTalk configuration mode.
Now, I know this is going to be hard to believe, but you’re done!
Now your Mac is configured to use the AppleTalk protocol to share and
access files and printers. AppleTalk is ready to go as soon as you click the
Apply button, but you won’t notice anything special when you turn on
AppleTalk. (Like TCP/IP, AppleTalk is invisible in Mac OS X until you use it.)
Check the “Accessing Files and Printers with AppleTalk” section later in this
chapter to actually start using AppleTalk to do stuff.
Manually configuring AppleTalk
Although not as simple as using the automatic configuration, manually con-
figuring AppleTalk is quite easy as well. To manually configure AppleTalk,
follow these steps:
1. Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu or the Dock.
2. From the System Preferences window that appears, click Network to
open the Network Preferences pane.
3. Click the Built-in Ethernet entry (or the connection you’re currently
using) from the list at the left side of the pane.
4. Click the Advanced button.
5. Click the AppleTalk tab to display the AppleTalk settings page.
6. From the Configure pop-up menu, choose Manually.
When you do, two more text boxes appear where you can enter informa-
tion, as Figure 3-1 illustrates: Node ID and Network ID. Unless you’re the
network administrator — check to see whether you’re surrounded by a
glowing aura of authority and wisdom — you must obtain these two ID
numbers from that glowing individual who is administering your network.
Use manual configuration only if you’re designing an AppleTalk network
or you have information from a network administrator on the correct
settings to use. If you enter the wrong settings, you won’t be able to
communicate with other Macs on your network, but at least you don’t
need to worry about blowing something up or watching your Mac melt.

Accessing Files and Printers with AppleTalk
522
7. After you enter the appropriate Node ID and Network ID, click the OK
button.
8. Click the Apply button to save those settings.
Accessing Files and Printers with AppleTalk
After you have AppleTalk configured and ready to go, you can share files and
printers from your Mac. If you’re wondering what to do after AppleTalk is
enabled, the following sections show you how to share your files and print-
ers as well as how to access files and printers that others have shared on the
network.
Accessing AppleTalk share points
Accessing share points — a collection of files that are shared to the network —
by using AppleTalk is much like accessing other shared files with Internet
Protocol (IP). In this section, I talk about finding AppleTalk servers, connect-
ing to AppleTalk share points, and how to disconnect when you’re done.
Follow these steps each time when you start your computer or if you get dis-
connected for any reason.
Even though a server version of Mac OS X exists that is meant to run on cor-
porate servers that do nothing but serve up files and printers to people, in
this entire section I use the word server to simply mean any Mac or other
computer that has AppleTalk running and is sharing files or printers.

Choosing an AppleTalk server
To choose an AppleTalk server, perform the following steps:
1. From the Finder, choose Go➪Connect to Server or press Ô+K on the
keyboard.
This brings up the Connect to Server dialog.
2. From this dialog, click the Browse button.
Your Mac searches the local network for any AppleTalk servers and dis-
plays a Finder window listing all the available servers.
3. Double-click the icon representing the appropriate AppleTalk server
that contains the share point that you want to access.
4. After you choose the AppleTalk server, click the Connect button.
To help cut down on the time that it takes to connect to this same server in
the future, just click the Add button (which proudly bears a plus sign), and
the server’s path is added to the Favorite Servers list. The next time that you
need to connect to that server, you need only double-click the server entry
in the Favorite Servers list. (This works for all servers, not just the AppleTalk
variety.) Ain’t life grand?
Leopard also maintains a list of the servers that you’ve connected to
recently, even if they don’t appear in the Favorite Servers list. Click the
Recent Servers button (which carries a clock icon) and then click the
desired server from the menu. You can also click Recent Items under the
Apple menu to show the same servers.
Connecting to the AppleTalk server
Each time you want to access files or printers via AppleTalk, you must con-
nect to the server. To connect to an AppleTalk server, you need to connect
as a Guest or, if you have a username and password for that server, as a
Registered User. After clicking the Connect button of the Connect to Server
dialog, you’ll be prompted to choose whether you want to connect as a
Guest or a Registered User.
If you’re connecting to the server as a Registered User, you must supply the
right username and password. If you connect as a Guest, you don’t have to
supply a password, but (depending on the access rights that have been con-
figured) you might have restricted access only to the Shared folder that
appears in the Users folder on each system that you connect to. If you con-
nect as a Registered User, you need to get the correct username and pass-
word from the person who is in control of user accounts on a given Mac.

Accessing Files and Printers with AppleTalk
524
Before you click the Connect button to complete the connection, consider
whether you’d like to automate things in the future. If so, enable the Remember
Password (Add to Keychain) check box. Enabling this check box saves the
username and password for this connection so that you don’t have to manu-
ally type it in each time that you reconnect to this particular share point
(particularly handy if you connect to a share point every time that you use
your Mac). However, use this option only if your Mac is in a secure location,
or if you can be sure that others won’t use this connection.
Choosing a share point from the AppleTalk server
Whether or not you chose to play with the connection options, finalize the
connection by clicking the Connect button after choosing to log in as a Guest
or a Registered User. After you click Connect, you see a list of share points
on the AppleTalk server.
Double-click the icon for the share point that you want. You see a network
drive appear on your Desktop, which you can treat as you would any other
attached drive.
Disconnecting from the share point
When you’re done using the share point, you can disconnect from the share
point in a few different ways:
✦Control+click the network drive Desktop icon and choose Eject from the
contextual menu that appears.
✦Click the network drive Desktop icon to highlight it and then choose
Eject from the File menu.
✦Click the network drive Desktop icon to highlight it and then press Ô+E.
✦Click the network drive icon in a Finder window sidebar and click the
Eject button next to it.
✦Click and drag the network drive Desktop icon to the Trash on the Dock.
The Trash changes into an Eject icon when dragging a network drive.
Simple but sassy.
Accessing AppleTalk printers
The other major thing (besides file sharing) that you can do with AppleTalk
is to connect to and use AppleTalk network printers. Again, like most things
under Mac OS X, it’s pretty straightforward and easy.

Adding an AppleTalk printer
Before you can print to an AppleTalk printer, you first need to add that
printer to your setup. Follow these steps to add a printer:
1. Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu or the Dock.
2. From the System Preferences window that appears, click Print & Fax
to open the Print & Fax Preferences pane.
3. Click the Add button (which carries a plus sign).
4. Click the AppleTalk button in the Browser toolbar.
You see a list of all the AppleTalk shared printers that your Mac sees on
the network.
If you’re on a network with more than just the local Zone, you might
need to select the appropriate Zone from the list on the left before you
see the desired printer.
5. Click the desired printer to select it in the list.
6. Click the Add button to complete the process.
You can now treat this as any other printer that could be connected
directly to your machine. You can view the print queue and hold,
resume, and delete print jobs from the Queue menu.
Removing an AppleTalk printer
Removing an AppleTalk printer that you’ve connected to is very simple.
Open the Print & Fax Preferences pane in System Preferences, click the
printer to select it and click once on the Delete button, which carries a
minus sign. The offending printer disappears from the list, and you can 
close System Preferences. Job done!

owadays, wireless connectivity is king. For example, cellphones have
gone from being a toy of the technological elite to a permanent fixture
on the hip of the common man. The shorts that I’m wearing right now have
a special pocket just for a cellphone to ride in; when I’m without my phone,
it usually carries a 5th Avenue candy bar. (Perhaps that was too personal . . .
sorry.)
Because people have become accustomed to being able to keep in touch
wherever they are, they also want to be able to have access to their net-
work, at least within their house or workplace, without the hassle of cables.
(Which, by the way, are magnets for pets that enjoy a good chew toy.) This
desire for convenience and the advances in wireless technology have com-
bined to bring you the concept of the wireless network — as well as wireless
coffee shops, wireless access providers, and even wireless gaming centers.
(In fact, Apple’s iPhone is a wireless Internet marvel, with instant connectiv-
ity to any Bluetooth-enabled Mac and full-featured e-mail and browsing
that’ll knock your socks off.)
Now you can be connected to your home local area network (LAN) and your
shared Internet connection (which I cover in Book V, Chapter 5) from your
balcony, deck, lounge chair in the yard, or even your bedroom. In this chap-
ter, I talk about how wireless networks work and then I give you a lot of
information to help you get the right pieces to free yourself — securely, 
mind you — from the world of the wired.
Speaking the Wireless Lingo
Wireless networks aren’t all that different from their wired siblings. In this
chapter, I discuss some of the features and limitations of wireless network-
ing, but you must first be familiar with a foundation of information.

Speaking the Wireless Lingo
528
Because of the technology involved in wireless networks and how things 
are changing rapidly in this area, you’ll find yourself swimming in a sea of
acronyms and other techno-babble. Although you don’t need to know every
little detail to be able to set up your own wireless network, you should know
some of these terms so that you can avoid getting stung by hackers or stuck
with equipment that’s on the verge of obsolescence. 
Here’s a quick list of terms that you’ll see on your road to becoming a wire-
less network guru:
✦WLAN: WLAN stands for Wireless LAN. If you’ve already read previous
chapters in this mini-book, a LAN (local area network) is just a bunch of
computers and other devices connected together.
✦IEEE: This stands for Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,
which is an organization that approves standards that allow computers,
network equipment, and just about anything else electronic to play
nicely together. Sometimes IEEE helps create these standards before
approving them, and sometimes it just approves standards that others
have produced.
✦802.11: This is the part of the IEEE standards that deals specifically with
wireless networking. 
Although wireless is usually generically referred to as wireless networks
(or sometimes even Wi-Fi), it’s all really a wireless form of Ethernet.
✦Wireless access point: A wireless access point, or WAP, is a device that
allows wireless network devices to connect to a wired Ethernet network.
✦Service Set Identifier: The Service Set Identifier, or SSID, is used to tell
your computer the name of the wireless network that you want to use.
✦Wired Equivalency Protocol: Wired Equivalency Protocol, or WEP, is an
encryption that wireless networks can use to keep your wireless net-
work more secure from snoopers and hackers.
✦Ad Hoc mode: An Ad Hoc wireless network is one where each wireless
device talks directly with all other wireless devices. 
Apple calls Ad Hoc mode a computer-to-computer network.
✦Infrastructure mode: This is where all wireless devices talk to a WAP,
and the WAP then talks to other wireless devices and the wired network.
As I cover the different parts of wireless networking and how to set it up,
you’ll find yourself using these terms over and over. Before you know it,
you’ll be spouting these wireless-related acronyms like a pro. (No, really. I’m
not kidding.)

Figuring Out the Different Flavors of Wireless Ethernet
One of the first things that you might notice when you start looking into
wireless networking is the different wireless standards. You should at least
be aware that these different standards exist: That way, you can be sure to
get wireless network components that will work together because some of
the different wireless standards are not compatible. (Feel free to photocopy
this list and stick it on your fridge door.)
Basic Wi-Fi: 802.11b
IEEE 802.11b has another name that you’ll likely see on product advertise-
ments, literature, or boxes in stores: Wi-Fi, which stands for Wireless Fidelity.
(Kinda like that cutting-edge Hi-Fi stereo from the ’60s and ’70s, where Hi-Fi
stands for High Fidelity.) Most folks proclaim Wi-Fi as only 802.11b. Wi-Fi is
the first version of wireless Ethernet. This version of wireless runs at speeds
up to 11 million bits per second, or 11 Mbps. The reason why I say that it
runs at speeds up to 11Mbps is because the actual speed that the data is
transferred depends on things like signal strength and quality. When the con-
ditions are such that your signal strength or quality is decreased — such as
an inconvenient concrete wall between you and your AirPort Base Station —
you might find that your wireless connection changes down to 5.5 Mbps, 2
Mbps, or even as slow as 1 Mbps.
802.11b has been largely supplanted in current wireless networking, and
almost all the equipment you can buy today is either 802.11g or 802.11n
(both of which I’ll cover in a moment). However, if you’re working with older
computers and existing 802.11b hardware, any networking equipment you
buy should be backward-compatible with 802.11b.
Apple’s AirPort network cards and standard-issue AirPort Base Station used
802.11b. In fact, it’s time for Mac owners to swell with pride yet again: Apple
was the first computer company to ship 802.11b hardware. (Back then, in
1999, it was the original AirPort Base Station.) Now, of course, Apple has
raised the bar with AirPort Extreme, which I discuss later in this chapter,
and the AirPort Express mobile Base Station.
In theory, Wi-Fi network cards have the ability to communicate with other
Wi-Fi devices and WAPs that are up to 1,000 feet away. Having said that, real-
ize that 1,000 feet is a generous estimate when outdoors on a clear day with
no wind blowing — you see what I’m getting at. In reality, when you set up
your wireless network, things such as walls — especially concrete walls, like
in basements — decrease the distance that you can cover. If you use a WAP,
plan on no more than 150 feet between wireless computers and the WAP.
However, your mileage might vary.

Figuring Out the Different Flavors of Wireless Internet
530
Wireless Ethernet networks operate just like wired Ethernet networks that
use a hub. (See Book V, Chapter 1 for more info on hubs.) Therefore, the 11
Mbps bandwidth is shared between all computers using it. Collisions can
also occur if more than one computer tries to communicate at the same
time. If you have a lot of people on your wireless network, the network will
get noticeably slower because of increased collisions. Remember that the
total bandwidth is shared between the computers on the wireless network.
This applies not only to Wi-Fi but also to the 802.11a (which I cover in the
next section) and the 802.11g standards.
One last thing about 802.11b networking: Wi-Fi uses the 2.4 GHz frequency
range. It actually uses 11 different channels, but they’re all around the 2.4 GHz
range. If you’re using a 2.4 GHz cordless phone or even a microwave, using
either device can definitely interfere with or even shut down your wireless
network. Keep this in mind when you buy your next phone or wonder why
your file transfers stop when you’re communing with Orville Redenbacher in
the microwave.
Let’s get Extreme: 802.11g
Although some hardware manufacturers have designed equipment that will
handle both Wi-Fi and 802.11a, Apple’s release of AirPort Extreme provides
802.11a networks
802.11a is a newer version of wireless Ethernet
than 802.11b. 802.11b came out first, and 802.11a
came out next. (I guess someone ran into a
doorframe.) 802.11a doesn’t have a generally
recognized handy nickname like Wi-Fi, so just
call it 802.11a.
802.11a equipment isn’t compatible with Wi-Fi
or any of the AirPort Base Stations, so don’t
make the mistake of buying both 802.11b and
802.11a network equipment. Instead, I strongly
recommend that you follow the AirPort Extreme
course charted by Apple and use the 802.11g
standard (which is backward-compatible with
Wi-Fi).
802.11a can run at speeds up to 54 Mbps —
almost five times faster than Wi-Fi. This is
because 802.11a uses the 5 GHz frequency
range instead of the cluttered 2.4 GHz range
that Wi-Fi uses. The powers that be set aside
the 5 GHz range just for wireless networking, so
cordless phones and microwaves (or any other
wireless devices for that matter) can’t interfere
with the network. The downside to using the
higher 5 GHz range, though, is that the dis-
tances that can be covered are even less than
that of Wi-Fi — no more than about 60 feet to
maintain the highest speeds.
Because of the incompatibilities with 802.11b
and the arrival of 802.11g, 802.11a, equipment
has all but disappeared, and you should steer
clear of it with a wide berth. (In fact, good luck
finding 802.11a hardware anywhere but eBay.)

Book V
Chapter 4
Going Wireless
Figuring Out the Different Flavors of Wireless Internet
531
both the speed of 802.11a and the compatibility with Wi-Fi. That’s because it
uses the 802.11g standard, which operates at speeds up to 54 Mbps (like
802.11a) but will also operate at the same frequency ranges and play nicely
with existing 802.11b equipment. (Notice that we’re heading in the right
direction again when it comes to naming conventions. Go figure.)
Apple is once again the first company to offer 802.11g hardware as standard
equipment. Feel free to enjoy the Superiority Dance yet again as you use
AirPort Extreme.
Naturally, there’s a downside: 802.11g returns to that pesky 2.4 GHz range, so
your cordless phone and microwave can also wreak the same havoc that
they did with your original AirPort equipment.
The guy with the turquoise teeth
I should also mention Bluetooth — a strange name for a wireless standard, I
admit, but it works like a charm. Bluetooth devices use 2.4 GHz as well, but
they’re designed only for very short distances . . . only about 30 feet. Blue-
tooth is the future for linking mobile devices (like personal digital assistants
and cellphones) and external peripherals (like wireless keyboards and mice)
to your Mac. In fact, Bluetooth is built-in to all current Macs, which can turn
your iMac or Mac Pro into a completely cordless machine — except for the
power cord, of course. Leopard provides built-in support for Bluetooth
through the iSync application.
Raising the bar to 802.11n
I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the new
wireless standard from IEEE: 802.11n. Most
third-party manufacturers (including Apple)
have already introduced 802.11n wireless equip-
ment. Apple’s 802.11n offerings include a new
AirPort Extreme base station, new AirPort
Extreme hardware in most of the Macintosh
computer line, and the spiffy Apple TV.
Why the hubbub? Oh, I forgot to mention that
802.11n can deliver throughput in excess of 100
Mbps! Don’t bet your house that you’ll get that
kind of speed, though — like the other mem-
bers of the 802.11 family, that’s likely to be a the-
oretical maximum speed.
You can’t go wrong with the 802.11n standard
when it arrives: think superfast wireless 
connections in your household or office. Ahh,
technology . . . .

Keeping Your Wireless Network Secure
532
Keeping Your Wireless Network Secure
Are you worried about the security of your AirPort wireless network? You
should be, bunkie. Imagine someone in the next apartment or house — or
standing right in your street — intercepting and monitoring your data from
your wireless network.
But before you decide to toss the idea of a wireless network, keep this in mind:
Even though it is technically possible that someone might camp out on your
doorstep in order to gain access to your wireless network, for most home
networks, this possibility isn’t very probable. Even if someone tries to gain
access to your wireless network and perhaps even sniff your network — a
techno-nerd term meaning to record all the data flying around a network —
there isn’t a whole lot someone can do with that information.
If a friend invites you for an evening of war driving, think “recreational
mobile hacking.” War driving is the act of driving through neighborhoods in 
a car equipped with a laptop computer and a wireless network card. The
payoff? If the hacker is lucky enough to locate a house with an open wireless
network, we’re talking free wireless Internet access . . . from the comfort of
his car! (Not to mention any shared files or information that’s available on
that network.) Again, keep security in mind when installing wireless hard-
ware, and these bozos will get nothing from your network.
You might say, “But I use my credit card on the Internet to buy stuff.” Sure,
this is a valid concern — however, if you purchase things on the Internet
with your credit card, you should already be using a secure connection pro-
vided by the Web site for your personal information so that the data you’re
sending across your wireless network is already encrypted and relatively
safe from thieves. (You’ll find more on this when I discuss Safari in detail in
Book IV, Chapter 5.)
“I have shared my files on my computer. Can the Bad Guys access those
shared files?” Another good question, but if you read Book V, Chapter 2, you
have to create an account for those whom you want to access your files.
Unless the would-be hacker is very good at guessing usernames and pass-
words, your files are pretty safe, too.
This is not to say that you bear absolutely no risk of being hacked. If a legiti-
mate user on your wireless network connects to your computer and starts
transferring a file, a would-be hacker could potentially record all the traffic
and then reconstruct the file that was sent from the data that was recorded.
In other words, a hacker could grab that user’s username and password.
That’s where WEP comes in.

Book V
Chapter 4
Going Wireless
Keeping Your Wireless Network Secure
533
WEP
Wired Equivalency Protocol, or WEP, is A Good Thing (even if it makes for a
silly-sounding acronym). It’s an encryption scheme that can be used on your
wireless network. WEP is a part of all 802.11 standards, so all your Wi-Fi
equipment supports WEP. Apple’s implementation of WEP comes in two 
varieties: 40-bit and 128-bit. The more bits used in the encryption, the more
secure (and the better) it is.
To use WEP, you need to select a WEP key, which is really just a code word:
✦The longer the key, the better. 
✦When making a key, use something like ab8sher7234ksief87 (something
that’s random with letters and numbers) as opposed to something, like
mykey, that’s easily guessed. 
If you’re using an Ad Hoc wireless network, all the computers need to have
their wireless network card configured with the same WEP key in order to
communicate. If you’re using a WAP to connect to the rest of the network,
you need to use the same key on your computers that you’ve configured on
your WAP.
One thing to note about WEP is that it’s been broken, meaning that someone
has figured out how to undo the encryption that WEP provides. For businesses,
especially those with sensitive data, WEP isn’t a good security solution.
However, for home users, WEP works well as a deterrent to keep people out.
In order for someone to crack your WEP key, that person needs to record
somewhere around 1 million encrypted packets or more. For a business, that
might only be an hour or so of monitoring for a hacker, but for most home
networks, this could take much longer. Remember that a typical home net-
work carries much less traffic than a business network. So, not only would
someone need to pitch a tent outside on your porch, he would need to be
able to record at least a million of the packets going over your network and
then have the knowledge to crack your encryption key. Although WEP isn’t
going to ward off the spies at the National Security Agency, it’s good enough
to protect home networks.
The LEAP security standard
Although all Wi-Fi network equipment supports WEP, some also offer the
LEAP standard for superior security.
Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP) is a protocol developed
by Cisco Systems. To use LEAP, you need to have a server that’s set up to
enable users to log in to gain permission to the wireless network. After you

Setting Up Your Wireless Network
534
initially log in (authenticate) to your network, LEAP changes encryption keys
on-the-fly at a time interval that you determine. You could set it so that every
15 minutes, your encryption key is changed: Even if someone is in that hypo-
thetical tent on your front lawn, he could never record enough packets to
figure out your key because it changes so often.
Setting up a server so that you can use LEAP isn’t something for the novice
to attempt. I would encourage you to read up on LEAP only if you’re very
serious about airtight security on your WLAN. The Cisco Web site (www.
cisco.com) is a good place to read about LEAP.
All the Apple AirPort 2.0 (and above) and AirPort Extreme wireless network
cards and Base Stations are compatible with the Cisco LEAP for higher 
security.
Setting Up Your Wireless Network
On to the good stuff. This section describes installing an AirPort Extreme
card as well as how to set up an Ad Hoc or infrastructure-based WLAN (wire-
less LAN).
Installing an AirPort Extreme network card
All of today’s Macs come with an AirPort Extreme (802.11g and 802.11n) card
built in. However, if your older Mac doesn’t have either type of AirPort card
installed, you can usually add one yourself. Naturally, older Macs don’t have
a slot or antenna for an AirPort card, such as the Indigo iMac with a 350 MHz
CPU. However, most Mac models made in the past two or three years with-
out built-in wireless still have a slot for an AirPort or AirPort Extreme card.
You just need to check www.info.apple.com/applespec to see whether
your particular Mac can use an AirPort card.
In case you have any issues using AirPort or need more information about
anything related to AirPort, check this page at the Apple Web site: www.
apple.com/support/airport.
You should be able to use any standard 802.11b Wi-Fi, 802.11g or 802.11n
card, but you might run into some issues with drivers and such. Be sure that
any non-AirPort/AirPort Extreme card that you might buy is backed up with
Mac OS X drivers.
A variety of 802.11g/n wireless network devices are available, many of 
which come with drivers for the Mac. Some of these devices connect via a
Universal Serial Bus (USB), which could be handy if you want to be able to

Book V
Chapter 4
Going Wireless
Setting Up Your Wireless Network
535
move it between a Desktop Mac Pro or iMac to a MacBook and back (without
the hassle of opening the case each time). Before you can set up your wire-
less network, you have to connect your wireless hardware. Because of the
differences between manufacturers, check the installation instructions that
come with whichever device that you choose.
After you have your AirPort, AirPort Extreme, or other 802.11b/g/n wireless
network card or device installed, you’re ready to connect.
Setting up an Ad Hoc wireless network
Using an Ad Hoc network — also called a computer-to-computer network — is
a fairly easy thing to accomplish in Mac OS X. Plus, you’re not limited to just
Macs: With an Ad Hoc network, you can also swap niceties with PCs and
PDAs that have 802.11b/g network interface cards (NICs) installed. This Ad
Hoc network is great for setting up an impromptu network in a classroom,
exchanging recipes and pictures at a family reunion in a park, or blowing
your friend up while gaming across the aisle of a Greyhound bus at 70 mph.
To set up an Ad Hoc network, you first have to create the computer-to-
computer network on one of your Macs. This takes advantage of the AirPort
Software Base Station that’s built into Mac OS X. 
Using non-Apple wireless equipment 
with AirPort Extreme equipment
Because of Apple’s implementation of wireless
standards within the AirPort Extreme product
line, keep in mind some things when trying to
mix Apple wireless equipment with other ven-
dors’ 802.11b or 802.11g equipment. As you dis-
cover elsewhere in this chapter, using AirPort
wireless networks can require a password,
which corresponds to the 802.11b/g WEP key
for encryption. However, the password that you
enter for AirPort networks isn’t exactly the
same as the WEP key for that same network. If
you’re using an AirPort network card and are
trying to connect to a non-Apple 802.11b WAP,
you need to follow a specific procedure. You
can find this procedure by going to http://
search.info.apple.com and searching
on the words 802.11b Compatibility . . . you’ll
also find helpful information at this same spot if
you’re using a non-Apple 802.11b network card
and are trying to connect to an Apple AirPort
Base Station.
You want my opinion? Because of the issues of
using non-AirPort 802.11b/g/n hardware with
The Real Thing (AirPort/AirPort Extreme stuff),
I recommend that you stick with Apple equip-
ment if possible.

Setting Up Your Wireless Network
536
To create a computer-to-computer network, follow these steps:
1. Click the AirPort status icon on the menu bar.
If you haven’t set Leopard to display your AirPort status in the Finder
menu bar, follow these steps:
a. Open the Network pane in System Preferences and choose the AirPort
entry in the list at the left of the pane. 
b. Enable the Show AirPort Status in menu bar check box.
c. Close the System Preferences window to save your changes.
2. Click Create Network to display the dialog that you see in Figure 4-1.
3. Enter a name for your network.
4. Mark the Require Password check box to turn on WEP encryption.
5. Enter a password for your network and then enter it again to confirm it.
Although you can leave encryption disabled, I highly recommend that
you turn it on and choose a password for that extra bit of security. (Just
call me Security Man.) Note that the password must be an exact length
(which is determined by whether you choose a 40-bit [5-character] key
or a 128-bit [13-character] key).
Out of the 11 channels available for 802.11b networks, channels 1, 6, 
and 11 are the only ones that don’t overlap other channels — and are

therefore the best choices to use. If you’re close to other WAPs, AirPort
Base Stations, or other Ad Hoc networks, try to find a channel that’s not
being used, or performance can be degraded. (If you have only one access
point, it doesn’t matter which channel you select — just allow Leopard
to automatically select a channel, which is typically Channel 11.)
6. Click OK.
Creating a computer-to-computer network gives the illusion of having an
AirPort Base Station. So for people to join your network, they would follow
the same steps that they would to join any other AirPort network, as I cover
in the next section.
Setting up wireless networks with 
an AirPort Base Station
After one computer is running a computer-to-computer network or you’ve
set up and configured an AirPort/AirPort Extreme Base Station, you’re ready
to invite other computers with wireless hardware to the party.
Joining in an existing AirPort network
After you have a network set up on one of your wireless-enabled computers,
you just need to have the other wireless-enabled computers join that net-
work. You can use the same process, as I describe here, to join any wireless
network:
1. Click the AirPort status icon on the menu bar.
A list of existing network connections appears in the AirPort menu.
2. Select an existing network connection that you’d like to join.
If you want to join a network whose name doesn’t appear in the list —
also called a closed network 
a. Select Other from the AirPort status menu.
b. Enter the name of the network that you want to join and the password
(if any is required). 
A closed network is another added measure of security — one that’s
good enough for most people because it’s very unlikely that a hacker is
going to try to hack a hidden network.
Disconnecting from an AirPort network
To disconnect from an AirPort/AirPort Extreme network, you can turn off
your AirPort card altogether, which I cover in the next section. (Simplicity,

Setting Up Your Wireless Network
538
they say, is an art.) Another way is to simply connect to another AirPort 
network — but this option is really only useful if you actually want to con-
nect to another network.
Turning your AirPort hardware on or off
Being able to turn your AirPort/AirPort Extreme hardware on and off actually
has its uses:
✦You might want to use your Mac, usually your laptop, in a place where
your wireless card shouldn’t be used, like 
• An airplane (when they tell you to turn off all cellphones) 
• A hospital area that doesn’t allow cellphones or other wireless
devices
✦Turning off your AirPort/AirPort Extreme hardware conserves your note-
book’s battery life. 
To turn your AirPort equipment on or off via the AirPort status icon on the
menu bar, give it a click and choose Turn AirPort On/Off from the resulting
menu.

Precious Internet Thing
In This Chapter
 Finding out how Internet sharing works
 Choosing between hardware and software Internet sharing
 Connecting your Macs to a cable/DSL router
 Adding wireless support to a shared Internet connection
A
lthough I discuss lots of fun stuff that you can do with your network in
previous chapters, this has to be my favorite: sharing a single Internet
connection between all the computers on your network. If you have more
than one computer, I’m sure that you’ve had to deal with the dilemma that
pops up whenever more than one person wants or needs to access the
Internet at the same time.
Luckily, because small home and office local area networks (LANs) use our
old friend TCP/IP for network communications, connecting an entire net-
work to the Internet isn’t as troublesome a task as you might think. In this
chapter, I talk about different hardware and software options for sharing
your Internet connection as well as how to include your wireless devices.
Sharing the Internet
Sharing a single Internet connection between all your computers can be a
boon simply because of the reduced chances of random acts of violence.
(Internet deprivation can be an ugly thing, you know.) Although I won’t
claim that Internet sharing will save lives, it can indeed save you from
headaches and arguments when more than one person wants to use the
Internet at once.
Throughout this chapter, I talk a lot about cable modems and Asynchronous
Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) modems. Both of these are high-speed
Internet connections — both are relatively inexpensive — that are offered
by your local cable company and your local phone company, respectively.
The phone company offers different kinds of digital subscriber line (DSL)

Using Network Address Translation

connections, the most common of which is ADSL. However, because differ-
ent kinds of DSL connections exist, in this chapter, I refer to them all generi-
cally as DSL.
To share your Internet connection, you need a few things, so here’s a quick
checklist:
✦An Internet connection: This could be a dialup Internet connection
that’s accessed via a standard v.90/v.92 analog telephone modem, or it
could be a cable or DSL modem connection.
✦A LAN: You need a standard LAN (which is connected with cables) or a
wireless LAN. See Book V, Chapter 1 for more information about setting
up a LAN and Book V, Chapter 4 for more on setting up a Wireless LAN
(WLAN).
✦An Internet-sharing device: I use the word device because the method
that you use to share your Internet connection could be software that
you run on one of your computers or hardware that is standalone,
depending on how you connect to the Internet and what fits your 
needs best.
When you have these three things ready to go, you can share your Internet
connection. However, you need to know some background information to
help you choose the right components and get everything up and running.
Using Network Address Translation
You must determine one thing before you start your Internet sharing quest:
the set of network Internet Protocol (IP) addresses that you’ll use. If you
used Book V, Chapter 1 to set up and configure your LAN, you might recall
that I suggest a specific range of IP addresses to use on your LAN. In case
you missed out on Chapter 1 of this mini-book, I briefly cover this important
topic again so that you can share your Internet connection smoothly.
(Forgive me if I wax technical, but ’tis only for the moment.)
When talking about IP addresses, the ruling body that tracks IP addresses
and where they’re used has broken all IP addresses up into two parts:
✦Public IP addresses: Public IP addresses are used to communicate on
the Internet, and only one device in the entire world can use a given
public IP address at any given time.
✦Private IP addresses: Private addresses, on the other hand, are sup-
posed to be used only on networks (like your home LAN) and do not
connect directly to the Internet. Lots of people can use the same private

541
address because their networks never go public: That is, they never
access the Internet, so their IP addresses never conflict.
Typically, you’ll use addresses in the form of 192.168.x.x on your LAN. See
Book V, Chapter 1 for an overview of IP addresses and how they work.
You might be wondering to yourself thusly: “If I use private IP addresses on
my LAN at home or in the office and I have to use a public IP address to com-
municate on the Internet, how can my private IP addresses on my LAN com-
municate with public IP addresses on the Internet?” That is an excellent
question, and the answer is Network Address Translation (or NAT for short).
NAT acts as a gatekeeper between your private IP addresses on your LAN
and the public IP addresses on the Internet. When you connect to the
Internet, your Internet service provider (ISP) gives you one — and usually
only one — public IP address that can be used on the Internet. Instead of
one of your computers using that public IP address and depriving all the
other computers on the LAN, the hardware or software that you use to share
the Internet will take control of that public IP address. Then, when any com-
puter on your LAN tries to communicate on the Internet, your NAT software/
hardware intercepts your communications and readdresses the traffic so
that it appears to be coming from your allotted public IP address. (Think of a
funnel that collects water from several different sources and then directs all
the water into a single stream.)
When the Web site, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server, or whatever strange
Internet intelligence you’re using on the Internet replies, it replies to your
NAT device. The NAT device remembers which private IP address it should
go to on the LAN and sends the information to that computer. See NAT at
work in Figure 5-1.
Ways to Share Your Internet Connection
After you have an Internet connection and your LAN is set up, you need
something to make this NAT thing work. You have two different options to
take care of NAT for your shared Internet connection: hardware or software.
(Go figure.) Each has pros and cons, so take a look at each option individually.
If you read Chapter 4 of this mini-book, you know that Leopard has AirPort
software built in. So, if you have an AirPort or AirPort Extreme wireless net-
work card in your Mac and you’re using Leopard, you can have your Mac act
like an AirPort Base Station for all the wireless computers on your network,
which in turn can use a software NAT.

Ways to Share Your Internet Connection

Using hardware for sharing an Internet connection
Probably the most popular way to share an Internet connection is to buy a
hardware device that connects to your Internet connection, which then con-
nects to your LAN. These devices are referred to as cable/DSL routers. The
main downside to a hardware Internet connection-sharing device is that it
costs more than a software solution.
Don’t let the name throw you: Although these devices are usually used to
share cable/DSL connections, many have the ability to use an external
analog telephone modem to connect to a standard dialup Internet account.
Cable/DSL routers are nice because they’re easy to set up and configure.
Too, you can leave them on, which means constant Internet access for those
on your LAN. You don’t have to worry about turning on another computer to
connect to the Internet like you do with a software solution. Sounds like a
good spot for a Mark’s Maxim:

Internet Thing
Ways to Share Your Internet Connection
543
Hardware routers are the best choice for sharing your Internet connec-
tion, so if you can afford one, you should get one!™
Apple’s AirPort and AirPort Extreme Base Stations are not only Wireless
Access Points (WAPs) for your network, as I discuss in Chapter 4 of this mini-
book, but they also act as Internet connection-sharing devices. (The AirPort
Express can’t share an Internet connection . . . sorry.) Some flavors of Air-
Port Base Station even have a built-in v.90 modem for sharing a single 56
Kbps connection using a dialup account! A base station typically has two
Ethernet connections for sharing a high-speed Internet connection: one to
connect to a cable/DSL router and one to connect to the LAN.
If you think that a cable/DSL router or an AirPort Extreme Base Station could
be the karma pathway for you to achieve your goal of sharing your Internet
connection, here are some things to consider when deciding which device to
buy for your LAN:
✦Do you need a switch? Most cable/DSL routers have a small 3-, 4-, or 
5-port switch built in. See Chapter 1 of this mini-book to discover more
about hubs and switches. This multiport capability is nice because the
same cable/DSL router that shares your Internet connection is also the
centerpiece of your LAN where all your connections meet, thus saving
you from having to buy a hub or switch on top of the cost of the cable/
DSL router.
Some cable/DSL routers, however, have only a single Ethernet connec-
tion to connect to your LAN. So keep in mind that if you choose a device
with a single LAN connection, you must supply your own switch that
would then connect the cable/DSL router to the rest of your LAN.
✦Got modem? If your only Internet connection is through a dialup
modem account, look for a built-in analog telephone modem on your
cable/DSL router. You must have this feature if you want to use a hard-
ware device to share your Internet connection. AirPort Extreme is great
for this because the modem is built in. Even if you have cable/DSL serv-
ice, most ISPs also include a dialup account with your broadband access.
With such a bountiful selection of connections, you can plug in both
your cable or DSL service to the cable/DSL router as well as use the
dialup account as a backup in case your main service has problems.
✦Want a printer with that? Some cable/DSL routers also have a port for
connecting a printer — a great feature to have because it allows you to
leave the printer connected and turned on so that anyone on the net-
work can print to it anytime. (This is much better than connecting the
printer to a computer and sharing it because then the computer doing
the sharing must always be on in order to make the printer available.)
Mac OS X can send a print job to a printer by using Bonjour or TCP/IP,

Ways to Share Your Internet Connection
544
so just make sure that your printer is compatible with TCP/IP printing,
also called LPR (Line Printer Remote).
Using software for sharing an Internet connection
As I mention earlier, if you’re using Mac OS X Leopard and have an AirPort or
AirPort Extreme wireless network card installed, your Mac can act like an
AirPort/AirPort Extreme Base Station, providing both wireless Ethernet con-
nectivity for other computers on the LAN and a shared Internet connection.
Leopard also has built-in software that allows a single computer on your net-
work to share its Internet connection with others on the LAN. To share your
Internet connection, follow these quick steps:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
2. Click the Sharing icon.
3. Click the Internet Sharing entry at the list on the left side of the pane.
This brings up the settings, as shown in Figure 5-2.
4. Click the Share Your Connection From pop-up menu and choose Built-
In Ethernet.
5. Select the Built-In Ethernet check box (in the To Computers Using list)
to enable it.

When you do, you’re issued a warning that enabling this could affect
your ISP or violate your agreement with your ISP. In my experiences, this
step has never caused any networking problems. However, if you have
any doubts, contact your ISP and verify this.
6. Click OK in the warning dialog to continue.
You go back to the Sharing dialog, where you’ll notice that the Internet
Sharing check box is conveniently ready for you to enable it — feel free
to click it now.
If you’re using a dialup modem to access the Internet, you need to also make
sure that the computer that has the modem also has an Ethernet or wireless
LAN connection. Unfortunately, most of the latest Mac models no longer
have a built-in modem, but if you buy an external USB modem from Apple 
(or a third-party vendor), you can still use this feature.
If you’re using a cable or DSL modem for your Internet connection, the Mac
that you want to run the sharing software on should have two Ethernet con-
nections: one to connect to the cable/DSL modem and one to connect to the
rest of the LAN.
The main disadvantage to using a software solution for Internet connection
sharing is that the computer that connects to the Internet must be turned on
and ready to go all the time so that others on the network can get to the
Internet. And although the sharing software operates in the background on
the machine it’s running on, it still chews up some of that Mac’s processing
power and memory, so it could slow down other applications that you’re
running on that computer.
Connecting Everything
After you decide whether to use a software or hardware solution, it’s time 
to get your hands dirty: All the pieces of the puzzle must be set up and con-
nected. In this section, I tell you how to connect things for either the soft-
ware or hardware method of sharing the Internet connection.
Using the software method
When you use the software method to share your Internet connection, one 
of the computers on your network has both the connection to the Internet
and a connection to the LAN. Figure 5-3 shows a typical setup for software
Internet sharing, whether you’re using a dialup modem account or a cable/
DSL modem for your Internet connection.

Connecting Everything
546
Keep in mind, though, that when using a cable/DSL modem for your Internet
connection, the computer running the sharing software must have two
Ethernet connections. If you’re using a standard dialup modem for Internet
access, chances are that it’s built into the computer used for sharing the
Internet connection.
Using the hardware method
Not only does using a dedicated piece of hardware free one of the Macs on
your network from the onerous job of hosting the shared connection, but it

also keeps you from having to have more than one Ethernet connection on a
single computer if you’re using a cable/DSL modem for your Internet access.
Figure 5-4 shows how you would connect your devices for hardware Internet
sharing by using either a cable/DSL router with a built-in Ethernet switch or
a cable/DSL router with a standalone Ethernet hub or switch, like you would
need to use AirPort or AirPort Extreme.

Adding Wireless Support
548
If you choose to buy a cable/DSL router that has a built-in Ethernet switch,
you can simply connect all your computers on the LAN to the built-in switch.
However, if you buy a cable/DSL router that has only a single LAN connec-
tion, like AirPort/AirPort Extreme, you must connect that single LAN connec-
tion to an external hub or switch in order to get all the computers on the
same network.
Regardless of whether you use the hardware or software method to share
your Internet connection, all the computers on your LAN — except the one
that’s doing the sharing if you’re using software sharing — should be config-
ured to obtain its IP address automatically through our old friend, Dynamic
Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). (See Chapter 1 of this mini-book for
detailed instructions on how to do this in Leopard.) Although it’s not a
requirement that you set up your other devices with DHCP, it’s recom-
mended unless you understand the IP addressing scheme required by your
cable/DSL router and you’re willing to set up the addresses manually. You
need to follow the instructions that come with the cable/DSL router or soft-
ware that you purchase for detailed information on how to configure that.
Adding Wireless Support
You might have noticed that I mention wireless here and there in this chap-
ter. This section covers in a bit more detail how you can add wireless capa-
bilities to your shared Internet party. To discover more about how wireless
networks work and how to set up one, see Book V, Chapter 4.
Basically, you’ll encounter a couple of situations when trying to add wireless
capabilities into the mix. Either you already have an Internet connection-
sharing mechanism in place (either hardware or software), or you don’t yet
have your Internet connection shared.
If you already have a cable/DSL router 
or are using software Internet sharing
If you already have a cable/DSL router or if you’re using software Internet
sharing, like that built into Leopard, you can simply buy a WAP and connect
it to your LAN. Adding a WAP enables anyone using wireless Ethernet access
to your network and thus to your shared Internet connection. There are many
WAPs that you can buy to add wireless to your network. AirPort Extreme is a
good example; however, because AirPort Extreme also can do Internet shar-
ing, make sure that you don’t enable the Internet sharing on the AirPort card!
(In this case, you don’t want or need this feature because it can conflict with
your cable/DSL router operation.)

Book V

Adding Wireless Support
549
If you do not have a cable/DSL router or 
an AirPort/AirPort Extreme Base Station
If you don’t have a cable/DSL router or an AirPort/AirPort Extreme Base
Station for Internet sharing, you have a few options. Each option has an
upside and a downside.
One option is to get an AirPort Extreme Base Station, which provides both
wireless access for AirPort-enabled wireless computers and Internet sharing
for the entire network. If your Base Station has only a single LAN Ethernet
connection and you have more than one computer using wired Ethernet, you
must buy an additional hub or switch to connect them.
The other option is to buy a combination cable/DSL router, which has a
built-in WAP. Most cable/DSL routers — including the ones that have wireless
built in — also have multiple Ethernet ports on them, so connecting comput-
ers by using wired Ethernet can be done without buying an external hub or
switch.
The final option is that you can use the AirPort software built into Leopard
to turn your Mac into an Airport/AirPort Extreme Base Station — that is, if
you have an AirPort wireless card on that particular Mac. This is a great,
low-cost way to add wireless and Internet sharing to your network. However,
many older Macs don’t come with an AirPort wireless card built in, and you
still can eat up processor time and memory by running the AirPort software.

ardware. We love it. To a Mac power user, new hardware holds all the
promise of Christmas morning, whether your new toys are used for
business or for pleasure. We pore over magazines and visit our favorite Mac
Web sites like clockwork to check on new technology.
These hardware devices don’t come cheap, however, forcing you to make
the painful decision of deciding which new hardware you really need in
order to accomplish what you want and which hardware is a luxury. Also, if
you’re a new Mac owner, you might not know what’s available. For example,
I constantly get e-mail from readers, asking, “What can I connect to my new
computer?” I guess I could reply, “Why, the kitchen sink!” To that end, I
decided to add this chapter to the book to let you know how you can
expand the hardware for your Mac OS X Leopard powerhouse.
Each section in this chapter provides a description of what a particular device
does, approximately how much it costs, and a set of general guidelines that
you can use when shopping. Although this isn’t in-depth coverage — after
all, the book is supposed to be about Leopard — it will serve to get you
started if you’ve just become a Mac owner. If you’re especially interested in
a specific piece of hardware, I recommend other books that you can read for
the exhaustive details.
Ready? To quote a great line from the first Batman film: “Alfred, let’s go
shopping!”

Parading Pixels: Digital Cameras, DV Camcorders, and Scanners
554
Parading Pixels: Digital Cameras, 
DV Camcorders, and Scanners
The first category of hardware toys revolves around images — hardware for
creating original images, capturing images in real time, and reading images
from hard copy.
Digital cameras
A digital camera shares most of the characteristics of a traditional film
camera. It looks the same, and you use the same techniques while shooting
photographs. The difference is in the end result. With a digital camera,
instead of a roll of film that has to be developed, you have an image in JPEG
or TIFF format that’s stored on a memory card. The contents of the memory
card can be downloaded to your Mac from within iPhoto (which I discuss
with great pleasure in Book III, Chapter 3), and then the real fun begins. Here
are some things that you can do with a digital photograph:
✦Edit it with an image editor such as Adobe Photoshop Elements
✦Print it with an inkjet, dye-sublimation, or color laser printer
✦Record it to a CD or DVD
✦Add it to a Web page
✦Print several of them in a coffee-table book (using iPhoto)
✦Mail it to friends and family
What they cost
Consumer-level digital cameras typically sell for anywhere from $200 (for a 
5-megapixel [MP] model) to $500 (for a 8MP camera). Megapixel is a general
reference to the resolution (the size of the image, measured in individual
dots called pixels) and detail delivered by the camera. Such digital cameras
can produce photographs that are well suited for just about any casual shut-
terbug. Professional digital cameras, which capture far more detail and offer
designs that more closely resemble the best SLR film camera, can set you
back $800 or $1,000. Because of their cost and complexity, I wouldn’t recom-
mend them to someone who’s just discovered digital photography.
What to look for
Here are some general guidelines that I recommend when selecting a digital
camera:

Book VI
Chapter 1
Hardware That Will
Make You Giddy
Parading Pixels: Digital Cameras, DV Camcorders, and Scanners
555
✦At least a 5MP camera: As a general rule, the higher the megapixel
value, the better the camera.
✦At least a 128MB memory card: The memory card stores the images
that you capture.
✦A Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection to your Macintosh: USB is cov-
ered in all its glory in Chapter 3 of this mini-book. USB 2.0 is definitely a
better choice than a slower USB 1.1 connection.
✦An optical zoom feature: Optical zoom allows you to draw closer to sub-
jects that are farther away.
Note that I recommended optical zoom there and not digital zoom.
Essentially, digital zoom is a silly feature that simply resizes a portion of
your image, providing a blocky close-up. In fact, an image editor like
Photoshop Elements can produce exactly the same result as a camera
with digital zoom . . . and it looks as bad. Only an optical zoom results in
a sharper magnification of the subject.
✦A self-timer: With a self-timer, your camera can snap a photo automati-
cally, allowing you to finally be seen in your own pictures!
✦A manual flash setting: Although automatic flash is a good thing most 
of the time, a manual setting allows you to disable your camera’s flash
for artistic shots (or just to prevent the glare on subjects with polished
surfaces).
For a full (even exhaustive) exposé of everything in digital photography,
check out Digital Photos, Movies, & Music Gigabook For Dummies, edited by
some guy named Mark L. Chambers (Wiley). Believe me, if it’s got anything
to do with digital photography, it’s in there!
DV camcorders
Like digital cameras, digital video (DV) camcorders are the counterpart to
the familiar video camcorder. A DV camcorder looks and operates like an
analog VHS camcorder, but you can connect it to your Macintosh via a
FireWire cable and download your video clips directly into iMovie. Today’s
crop of DV camcorders can also record in High Definition (HD for short) for
your widescreen TV or monitor. (Chapter 4 of Book III explains all about
iMovie, and FireWire is tackled in Chapter 3 of this mini-book.)
Besides the higher quality of digital video, it has a number of other real
advantages over analog video:
✦Digital video can be edited with applications such as iMovie or Final Cut
Express.

Parading Pixels: Digital Cameras, DV Camcorders, and Scanners
556
✦Digital video can be recorded to a CD or DVD.
✦Digital video can be posted for downloading on a Web page.
What they cost
A typical DV camcorder starts at about $300, with camcorders that record
directly to a blank DVD or record in HD selling for around $800.
If a DV camcorder is too costly of an investment, you can always convert
analog video — video from your current VHS camcorder or VCR — into 
digital video by using an inexpensive device called an AV converter.
What to look for
I recommend the following when shopping for a DV camcorder:
✦The highest optical zoom in your price range: Again, like a digital
camera, it’s important to be able to capture subjects and action when
you can’t get any closer — think the lion exhibit at the zoo.
✦Image stabilization: This helps steady the picture when you’re holding
the camcorder without a tripod.
✦Onboard effects: These effects generally include some snazzy things
like black and white footage, fades, and wipes.
✦AV connectors: Use these to display your video by connecting the cam-
corder directly to your TV.
✦Support for FireWire (IEEE 1394) connectivity: For more details on
FireWire, see Chapter 3 of this mini-book.
✦Digital still mode: This enables you to take still photographs if your digi-
tal camera isn’t handy; however, the image quality isn’t as good as a
bona fide digital camera.
For an in-depth look at digital video, check out Digital Video For Dummies,
4th Edition, by Keith Underdahl (Wiley).
Scanners
Figure 1-1 illustrates a typical flatbed scanner, which is the tool of choice for
those Macintosh owners who want to digitize images and text from printed
materials. Although you can also connect a sheet-fed scanner, flatbed
models are much more versatile and produce better-quality scans.

Book VI
Chapter 1
Hardware That Will
Make You Giddy
Parading Pixels: Digital Cameras, DV Camcorders, and Scanners
557
Images produced by a scanner can be edited, mailed, displayed on the Web,
or added to your own documents, just like the images from a digital camera.
What they cost
A good-quality scanner should cost anywhere from $100–$300, with the best
models — featuring the fastest scanning speeds, best color depth, and high-
est resolutions, or those meant for scanning film negatives — going for any-
where from $500 to $1,000.
What to look for
Try to get the following features in a scanner:
✦The highest color depth that you can afford: Get a minimum of 48-bit.
✦The highest resolution that you can afford: Get a minimum of 2400 dots
per inch (dpi) (optical).
✦Single-pass scanning: This feature results in a faster scan with less
chance of error.
✦Transparency adapter for scanning film negatives: If you’re a tradi-
tional film photographer, you’ll find that a transparency adapter turns a
standard flatbed scanner into an acceptable negative scanner.
✦One-touch buttons for e-mailing your scanned images or uploading
them to the Web: These are controls of convenience — pressing one of
these buttons automatically scans the item and prepares the image to be
e-mailed or uploaded to a Web site.
✦USB 2.0 or FireWire connection: I cover the advantages of both in
Chapter 3 of this mini-book.
Another shameless (but good-natured) plug. My best-selling book Scanners
For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley) offers comprehensive coverage of all types
of scanners, as well as chapters devoted to advanced features, image editing,
and step-by-step projects.

Although your Mac is already equipped with a keyboard and a mouse, you
can replace them with enhanced hardware that will add functionality and
precision to your work. (Or, you can buy a joystick and spend your days
wreaking havoc on your enemies.)
Keyboards
If you’re using the latest Intel iMac or Mac Pro tower model, you don’t really
need to upgrade your keyboard. These new machines come with excellent
keyboards already, replete with volume controls and a Media Eject key.
However, if you’re using an older Macintosh — or you have a MacBook or
MacBook Pro and you want to add an external keyboard — you can take
advantage of the convenience of a USB keyboard like the one in Figure 1-2.
What they cost
Aftermarket (nonstandard-issue) keyboards generally cost anywhere from
$30 to $100.
What to look for
Look for the following keyboard features when shopping for a keyboard:

✦Ergonomic wrist pad: Use these to help prevent wrist strain and repeti-
tive joint injuries.
Trackballs
Some folks prefer using a trackball, like the one shown in Figure 1-3, over a
mouse any day . . . even the Mighty Mouse now included with new Mac desk-
tops. Graphic artists find that trackballs are more precise and offer better
control, usually including a secondary button to display contextual menus.
(One model on the market has eight buttons. Who needs a keyboard?)

What they cost
Trackballs range in price from $20 to $90. Most are optical (see the following
section), so they need little cleaning, and they’ll last for many years of pre-
cise pointing at things.
What to look for
Look for the following features when shopping for a trackball:
✦More programmable buttons: Opt for at least two buttons!
✦Optical tracking: An optical trackball — one that doesn’t use rollers,
instead using a photosensitive sensor to record the movement of 
the ball — is more precise and easier to keep clean.
✦A scroll wheel: Use this gizmo to scroll documents up and down.
✦Ergonomic design: Look for a wrist pad or slanted buttons.
Joysticks
Game players, unite! For arcade and sports games, using a joystick results 
in increased maneuverability, more realistic action, higher scores, less wear
and tear on your keyboard . . . and just plain more fun. Joysticks range from
the traditional USB aircraft controller, as shown in Figure 1-4, to USB con-
trollers and gamepads that rival anything offered on today’s console game
machines.

What they cost
Joysticks vary in price from $30 to $120. At the low end, you’ll usually find 
the gamepad-type controllers, and aircraft controllers carry the highest
price tag.
What to look for
Get the following features in a joystick:
✦Yet even more programmable buttons.
✦Pitch and yaw controls. These are for the flight simulator crowd.
✦Force feedback. A force feedback joystick or gamepad rumbles and
moves in tandem with the action in the game, providing an extra feeling
of realism.
Drawing tablets
A drawing tablet like the one you see in Figure 1-5 might be pricey, but if
you’re a graphic artist or a designer, using a tablet will revolutionize the way
that you work with your Mac — especially with the Inkwell technology built
into Mac OS X. Rather than use a mouse or trackball to sketch, you can draw
on the tablet freehand, just like you would draw on paper or canvas. Tablets
can recognize different levels of pressure, allowing applications, such as
Photoshop and Painter, to re-create all sorts of photo-realistic brush effects.

Sublime Storage: CD/DVD Recorders
562
What they cost
Depending on the size of the tablet and the pressure levels that you need,
you’ll pay anywhere from around $100 to a whopping $500.
What to look for
I recommend the following tablet features:
✦Programmable buttons: See a trend here?
✦Accessory mouse: Some high-end tablets include a mouse that you can
use along with the tablet.
✦A cordless stylus: Make sure that it doesn’t require batteries.
✦The highest number of pressure levels possible: The more levels that
the tablet offers, the more subtle and precise your control is over paint-
ing effects.
Sublime Storage: CD/DVD Recorders
I don’t include Zip drives in this category because the arrival of cheap, reli-
able optical storage has rendered a 750MB Zip cartridge obsolete. 750MB
seems a little insignificant next to a rewriteable DVD-RW drive, which can
store 4.7GB on a single disc, or the latest dual-layer drives, which can store
8.5GB! (And don’t even get me started on the next generation of optical 
technology — the Blu-ray and HD-DVD recorders — they can store 50GB on 
a single disc!)
If you’d like to trade data with another Mac or a PC via floppy disks, you can
get an external USB floppy drive for under $50 — however, I personally
eschew floppy disks, which are very unreliable and carry a mere 1.44MB of
data. Pick up a USB Flash drive instead.
All recent Mac models include a rewriteable optical drive — either a CD-RW
or the DVD-RW SuperDrive — but if your computer is older and didn’t come
equipped with a recorder (or you want the latest Blu-ray storage capacity),
you can always add an external model.
What they cost
A FireWire DVD-RW drive averages about $150.

What to look for
Get the following features in an external DVD recorder:
✦An internal buffer of at least 8MB: The larger the buffer, the less
chance that you’ll encounter recording errors and the faster your drive
will burn.
✦At least 16X DVD recording speed: A no-brainer here. The faster the
recording speed, the less time you’ll wait for the finished disc.
✦AC power through the USB 2.0 or FireWire cable: This eliminates the
need for a separate AC power supply.
✦Burn-proof technology: This virtually eliminates recording errors
because of multitasking so that you can continue to work on other appli-
cations while you record.
Okay, just one more. I’m very proud of another of my books in the For
Dummies series, CD & DVD Recording For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley). It
covers everything that you need to know about producing all sorts of discs —
everything from basic data and audio CDs to DVDs and more exotic formats
such as CD Extra. Mac owners will be happy to know that this book covers
the Mac like a blanket, too.

Although virtually all Macs ship with speakers, I’ll be honest — the “stock”
speakers don’t measure up to the standards of a true audiophile. For those
who really enjoy their music and their game audio, this last section covers
the world of Macintosh aftermarket sonic enjoyment.
Subwoofer speaker systems
The ever-popular USB port again comes to your rescue. This time, it enables
you to connect a more powerful speaker system with a subwoofer. If you’ve
never heard a subwoofer — think chest-rattling thump, thump, thump — they
provide the basement-level bass that can add power and punch to both your
music and your games. Being hit by an asteroid is a rather flat, tinny expe-
rience with a pair of battery-powered speakers that you salvaged from your
Walkman years ago. With a new set of speakers and a subwoofer, you’ll swear
that Han Solo is sitting in the cockpit chair next to you!

With the growing importance of the computer as a replacement for your home
entertainment center, investing in a more powerful set of speakers will help
you enjoy all those audio CDs and MP3s that you’ve added to your iTunes
Playlists. (Read all about iTunes in Book III, Chapter 2.)
What they cost
Most USB-powered speakers with a subwoofer are priced below $100, but
true audiophiles looking for surround sound can spring for a $500 system
that includes five satellite speakers and a subwoofer.
What to look for
Get these features in a subwoofer:
✦At least 30 watts of power: The higher the wattage rating, the more
powerful the speakers (and the louder your music can be).
✦Additional headphone jacks and stereo mini-plug input jacks: Use
these for connecting your iPod or MP3 player directly to your speaker
system. (Read all about iPods in the next section.)
✦Magnetic shielding: This helps prevent your speakers from distorting
your monitor display.
MP3 players (well, actually, just the iPod)
I’ve lusted after Apple’s iPod MP3 player ever since it arrived on campus.
Depending on which model you get, this incredible device can hold up to
80GB of MP3 digital audio — that’s over 20,000 songs — as well as digital
photographs and full-length movies! Plus, the iPod also acts as your personal
data butler by carrying your files; it’s an honest-to-goodness external USB 2.0
hard drive. In fact, if you pick up an iPod Shuffle, it acts as a USB Flash drive.
You can download your contacts and appointments from Mac OS X and view
them wherever you go. Just think: Carry your files to and from your office
and carry Devo and the Dead Kennedys and watch a movie you downloaded
as well! Oh, and did I mention that you can play games with the iPod and
iPod nano models?
All this fits into a beautiful, stylish package about the size of a pack of ciga-
rettes, with up to a 20-hour lithium rechargeable battery, high-quality earbud
headphones, and automatic synchronization with your iTunes MP3 library.
(The iPod Shuffle is the smallest member of the iPod family — it’s less than 
2 inches square.) Life just doesn’t get any better for a technoid like me. If
you think that your Mac is a well-designed piece of equipment, you’ll under-
stand why this little box is so alluring. (And why I have one now.)

Sure, other MP3 players are out there, but many of them share the same fol-
lowing problems:
✦They use digital memory cards, which offer far less capacity than the
iPod.
✦They use standard batteries, or you have to furnish rechargeable batter-
ies (which don’t last 20 hours).
✦They don’t operate as an external hard drive, photo slideshow reposi-
tory, movie theater, or contacts/appointment database.
I say forget ’em. The iPod is worth every cent that you’ll pay.
The 1GB iPod Shuffle is less than $80 at the time of this writing, while the

ost Macintosh owners will make two upgrades — adding more
memory (RAM) and additional hard drive space — during the lifetime
of their computers. These two improvements have the greatest effect on the
overall performance of Mac OS X. By adding RAM and additional hard drive
space, you not only make more elbow room for your applications and docu-
ments, but everything runs faster: Think of the Six Million Dollar Man, only a
heck of a lot cheaper to operate (and no strange noises accompanying your
every move).
In this chapter, I steer you around the hidden potholes along the way for
those who aren’t well versed in selecting memory modules or weighing the
advantages of different types of hard drives. However, if you buy the wrong
piece of hardware, remember that using a hammer to make it fit is not a
workable option.
Adding Memory: Reasons for More RAM
Of all the possible upgrades that you can make to your Macintosh, adding
more random access memory (RAM) is the single most cost-effective
method of increasing the performance of Mac OS X. (In fact, your machine
will likely run faster with more memory than a reasonably faster processor!)
Here is exactly what Mac OS X uses available RAM for:

Adding Memory: Reasons for More RAM
568
✦Applications: Naturally, Mac OS X needs system RAM to run the applica-
tions that you launch. The more memory in your machine, the larger the
applications that you can open and the faster they’ll run.
✦Overhead: This includes the operating system itself, as well as various
and sundry buffers and memory areas devoted for temporary work. 
As you would guess, the more memory here, the merrier. (For more
information on the settings that control Classic mode, see Book II,
Chapter 3.)
✦Virtual memory: A ha! Now here’s something that I mention lightly and
politely in Book I but didn’t really amount to a hill of beans until this
moment. (Can you tell I’m a big fan of Bing Crosby?) Virtual memory
allows Mac OS X to use empty hard drive space as temporary system
memory, as shown in Figure 2-1. Data is written to your hard drive
instead of being stored in RAM, and then it’s erased when it’s no longer
needed. This is a neat trick that’s also used by Windows, Linux, and dear
old Mac OS 9 (just nowhere near as well as Mac OS X). Virtual memory
works automatically within Mac OS X, so you don’t have to enable it
manually as you did in Mac OS 9.
At first, virtual memory sounds like absolute bliss, and it does indeed allow
your Macintosh to do things that would otherwise be impossible, like run-
ning an application that requires 300MB of RAM in just 128MB of actual phys-
ical RAM. However, here come the caveats:
✦Virtual memory is slow as molasses in December. Even today’s fastest
hard drive is many, many times slower than real silicon, so any use of
virtual memory instead of RAM slows down Mac OS X significantly.
✦Virtual memory abuses your hard drive. If you’ve ever run Photoshop 
on a Windows PC with 64MB of RAM, you’re having flashbacks right

now — whenever your Macintosh is using virtual memory, your hard
drive remains almost constantly active. (Hardware types, like myself,
call this phenomenon thrashing because we know what’s happening
inside that poor hard drive.) Over time, running any computer with
insufficient RAM and behemoth applications will result in a significant
increase in hard drive wear and tear.
✦Virtual memory costs you processing power. With sufficient RAM, Mac
OS X gleefully runs as efficiently as it can — when virtual memory kicks
in, however, your Mac has to spend part of its quality time shuttling data
to and from the hard drive, which robs your computer of processing
power.
The moral of the story is very simple, so it’s time for another of Mark’s
Maxims:
The less that Mac OS X needs to use virtual memory, the better.™
To put it another way, physical memory (meaning memory modules) is
always a better choice than virtual memory. This is why power users and
techno-types crave as much system memory as possible.
A mere two years ago, 128MB of RAM was a quite comfortable figure for
most folks, but most of today’s Macs can accept at least a whopping 3GB
(that’s short for gigabyte, or 1,024 megabytes) of system RAM. (At the
extreme end of the scale, the King Kahuna — Apple’s latest Mac Pro — can
now accommodate an unbelievable 16 gigabytes of RAM!)
If you’ll be keeping your current Macintosh for a few years more, install as
much memory as you can afford — you’ll thank me every time that Mac OS X
Leopard boots.
Shopping for a RAM Upgrade
Before you click some online computer store’s Buy button, you need to
determine two things that will help you determine which memory module to
buy: how much RAM you’ve already got and how much more your system
can handle.
Finding out the current memory in your Mac
Memory modules are made in standard sizes, so you need to determine how
much memory you already have and which of your memory slots are filled.
To do this, open an old friend you might have used in Mac OS 9, the Apple

Shopping for a RAM Upgrade
570
System Profiler. Here, open System Profiler by clicking the Apple menu,
choosing About This Mac, and then clicking the More Info button.
After you launch this application, it takes a few seconds to scan your
Macintosh and display all sorts of identifying information about the hardware
and software that you’re using. Check out the Memory item in the Hardware
section. Here you can see exactly how many memory modules you have,
what type they are, and how much memory each provides. For example, in
Figure 2-2, my MacBook Pro has two memory slots — labeled Bank0/DIMM0
and Bank1/DIMM1. Both those slots are filled to the brim with a 1GB module
each, giving me a total physical memory of 2048MB, or 2GB. Jot down the
name and contents of each slot on a piece of paper — or, if you’re a real Mac
OS X power user, add a Sticky to your Desktop with this information.
(Stickies are covered in Book II, Chapter 2.)
However, on some machines, only one memory module can be upgraded by
a mere mortal. For example, on many older iMac G4 models, DIMM0 is an
internal module and can be upgraded only by an Apple technician. (Insert
sound of harps playing here.)
Unfortunately, this arrangement differs on just about every model of
Macintosh ever made — some have more memory slots, and others allow
you to upgrade all the system memory instead of just one module. The only
way to determine which modules are accessible on your Mac is to identify
the exact model of your computer.

The Tao of Hard Drive Territory
571
Determining the exact model of your computer
Most folks know the type and model of their computers, but there’s a catch
here, too: Sometimes the memory that you need varies by the processor in
your Macintosh. For instance, many different versions of iMacs have been
made since the Bondi Blue Beast debuted, and over the course of those
years, Apple has made a slew of changes inside. Your eye should be on the
actual processor speed and bus speed — the transfer speed that data
reaches whilst speeding across your motherboard — because they’re the
identifying factors here. An older iMac with a 333 MHz G3 processor, for
example, will use a different type of memory from the latest iMac with a 2.33
GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor.
Again, your salvation turns out to be Apple System Profiler. Just click the
Hardware section to display both the machine speed (or processor speed)
and the bus speed. (For example, my machine has a 1.83 GHz Intel Core Duo
CPU running at 677 MHz bus speed.) Grab that same piece of paper (or open
that same Sticky) and add these two figures to your list.
Now you’re armed with the information that you need to go online and buy
the right memory — or, if you’d rather work directly with a human being,
you can visit your local Apple dealer, present that most august personage
with the list, and have the memory upgrade ordered for you.
Buying memory online is much cheaper. I recommend the following online
stores:
✦MacMall: www.macmall.com
✦MacWarehouse: www.cdw.com
✦MacConnection: www.macconnection.com
The Tao of Hard Drive Territory
Next, turn your attention to the other popular Mac upgrade — adding extra
hard drive space. With today’s cutting-edge, 3-D games using a gigabyte of
space each and Photoshop CS3 expanding to a minimum of 750MB, IDC
(short for Insidious Data Creep) is a growing problem. (Bad pun most cer-
tainly intended.)
You can save space by deleting those files and folders you don’t need, but
what fun is that? To reduce your Mac’s waistline before you consider 
adding more room, I recommend using Spring Cleaning from Smith Micro
Software, which you can find at www.allume.com. It’s a great tool for

locating duplicates, removing empty folders, and uninstalling old programs
that you no longer use.
To determine how much free space remains on a hard drive, click the drive’s
icon on your Desktop and press Ô+I to display its information, as shown in
Figure 2-3. (I’m a major-league Mozart fan-boy, hence the name of my hard
drive.)
As a general rule, the following factors indicate that you’re ready to upgrade
your hard drive territory:
✦You have less than 2GB of space on your current hard drive.
✦You’ve cleaned all unnecessary files, and your Mac is still lagging behind
in storage.
✦You need to share a large amount of data between computers that aren’t
on the same network. (Read on to discover why.)

Internal versus External Storage
573
Internal versus External Storage
Just about everyone who upgrades their existing hard drive does so because
they need extra space; however, you might also need to add a hard drive 
to your system that can go mobile whenever necessary. Unlike an internal
drive — which resides hidden inside your Mac’s case — an external drive is
a lean, mean, self-contained traveling storage machine that’s perfect for road
warriors.
External drives
External removable cartridge drives, such as a Zip drive, are fine for folks
who have to send cartridges to other locations. Unfortunately, however, 
the capacities of these drives are rapidly falling behind conventional, 
non-removable external hard drives. Also, all modern Macs now have either
a CD-RW or DVD-R drive, which basically render Zip technology obsolete.
Therefore, if you’re considering an external unit, go with the most popular
pick — a high-capacity non-removable hard drive, which offers the most
storage for your dollar.
Most external drives are shock-mounted (meaning that they can take more
abuse than an internal hard drive), and they carry their own power supply.
In fact, some external drives actually don’t need a separate power supply
because they draw their power through your Mac’s Universal Serial Bus
(USB) or FireWire port. (The next chapter in this mini-book tells all about
USB and FireWire.) You can also use a superfast external SATA drive with a
MacBook or MacBook Pro if you invest in a SATA card adapter for your
laptop’s card slot.
External drives also have a number of other advantages:
✦No installation hassle: You can easily install a USB or FireWire drive in
seconds. Simply plug in the drive to the proper connector on the side or
back of your Mac, connect the power supply (if necessary), and turn it
on. (No software installation necessary. As the folks in Cupertino are
fond of saying, “Look, Ma — no drivers!”)
✦No extra space needed: Many Macs simply don’t have the internal 
space for another drive — laptops, iMacs, and the Mac Mini are good
examples. Therefore, if you want to keep your existing internal drive 
as-is while you’re adding more storage, an external drive is your only
choice.

Internal versus External Storage
574
✦File sharing with ease: With an external drive, you can share your data
between multiple computers or bring your files with you on your next trip.
✦Safe from prying eyes: Unlike an internal drive, external drives are easy
to secure. Take your sensitive information home with you or lock it in 
a safe.
After you plug in an external drive, Mac OS X displays it just like any other
hard drive volume. Figure 2-4 illustrates my 30GB FireWire drive in action.
(Any Mac can boot from an external FireWire drive, but only Intel-based
Macs can boot from an external USB drive.)
Internal drives
Your other alternative is to upgrade your internal drive, which can be a
hassle. Like a memory upgrade, adding or swapping an internal drive
involves opening your Mac’s case. In fact, it’s a somewhat more complex pro-
cedure than adding memory.
I usually recommend that folks add a second drive rather than swap out
their existing drive. You’ll avoid the hassle of backing up and restoring your
system on a new drive or (even worse) reinstalling Mac OS X and then rein-
stalling all the applications that you use. (Swapping a hard drive should be
the definition of the word hassle.) Instead, add a second drive and leave your
current hard drive as-is.

Determining How Much Space You Need
575
However, here are a number of very important reasons why many Mac
owners choose updating internal drives, even with the hassle of swapping:
✦They’re cheaper. You’ll spend significantly less on an internal drive
because it doesn’t need the case and additional electronics required by
an external drive.
✦They’re faster. Even a FireWire or USB 2.0 drive isn’t as fast as an inter-
nal drive.
✦They take up less space in your work area. An internal drive eliminates
the space taken by an external drive, which can range anywhere from
the size of a paperback to the size of a hardback book.
After you establish that you are in fact ready for more space — and you’ve
decided whether you want to add an internal drive, an external drive, or (if
you enjoy punishment) upgrade your existing internal drive — you’re ready
to consider how big of a drive you need.
Determining How Much Space You Need
Your next step is to decide just how much hard drive space is enough. I sup-
pose that if your last name is Gates and you live in Redmond, you can proba-
bly pick just about any drive on the market. However, I have a family, a
mortgage, a car payment, and lust in my heart for the latest computer
games; therefore, I must be a little more selective.
I have two hard-and-fast rules that I follow when I’m determining the capac-
ity of a new drive:
1. If you’re buying a replacement for your existing drive, shop for a drive
with at least twice the capacity of the existing drive (if possible).
2. If you’re buying an external drive, shop for a drive with at least half the
capacity of your existing internal drive (if possible).
Those rules seem to work pretty doggone well in most circumstances with
these two exceptions: gamers and digital video gurus. These folks need to
shoehorn as much space as they possibly can into their systems. If you’re 
a hardcore gamer or if you work primarily with digital video, you need a
wheelbarrow’s worth of hard drive capacity. Trust me: Buy the biggest hard
drive that you can afford.

Shopping for a Hard Drive
576
Shopping for a Hard Drive
Ready to brave the local Wireless Shed superstore (or perhaps its Web site)?
Here’s a list of guidelines to keep handy while you’re shopping for a new
internal or external hard drive:
✦Faster is indeed better. You’ll pay more for a 10,000 revolutions per
minute (rpm) drive than a slower 5,400 or 7,200 rpm drive, but the extra
cash is worth it. Faster drives can transfer more data to your Mac in 
less time.
Faster drives are especially important for storing digital video.
✦Serial ATA and EIDE drives are different. If you’re replacing your inter-
nal drive, you have to get the same type of drive that you already have:
EIDE or Serial ATA. (EIDE is a common parallel ATA standard hard drive
used in PCs.) Again, System Profiler can tell you which type of drive
your Mac is currently using.
If you’re buying a EIDE drive larger than 128GB, look for an ATA-133 drive
so you can use the full capacity. If an EIDE drive is an ATA-100 drive,
Macs only recognize a maximum size of 128GB.
✦Avoid used or refurbished drives. Hard drives are one of the few 
components in your computer that still have a large number of moving
parts. Therefore, buying a used drive isn’t a good idea unless it’s priced
very low.
Because the prices on new hard drives are constantly dropping, make
sure that you check on the price for a new, faster drive of the same
capacity before you buy that bargain used drive.
✦Pick FireWire over USB 1.x every time. Compared with a FireWire con-
nection, a USB 1.x external hard drive is simply a joke when it comes to
performance. Because most Macs with USB ports also have FireWire
ports, make very sure that you buy a FireWire drive! (If your Mac has
USB 2.0 ports, which will show up in System Profiler as well, you can 
buy a USB 2.0 drive without being embarrassed — remember, however,
that FireWire drives are still more efficient and faster overall compared
to USB 2.0. Or, invest in a drive that has both FireWire and USB 2.0 
connectors!)
✦Watch the size of the drive when buying internal drives. Most SATA
(Serial ATA) and EIDE (Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics) drives are
standard half-height 3.5” units, but check to make sure that you’re not
investing in a laptop drive — unless, of course, you’re upgrading a
laptop.

Installing Your New Stuff
577
Installing Your New Stuff
After you get your memory modules or hard drive, pick from one of two
methods of installing them: easy and hard. Guess which method will cost
you money?
The easy way
Your Apple dealer can perform either type of hardware installation for you.
You can rest easy knowing that the job will be done right, but money will def-
initely change hands.
Personally, I always recommend that owners of MacBook and MacBook Pro
laptops allow their dealers to install hard drives because these laptops are
much more complex than a desktop, and they’re much easier to damage.
The hard way
If you’re familiar with the inside of your Macintosh, you can install your own
upgrade and save that cash. A memory upgrade is one of the simpler chores
to perform, but that doesn’t mean that everyone feels comfortable taking 
the cover off and jumping inside a computer; hard drives are a tad more
complex.
If you have a knowledgeable friend or family member who can help you
install your hardware, buy him the proverbial NSD (short for Nice Steak
Dinner) and enlist him in your cause. Even if you still do the work yourself,
it’s always better to have a second pair of experienced eyes watching, espe-
cially if you’re a little nervous.
Because the installation procedures for both memory modules and hard
drives are different for every model of Mac — heck, even removing the cover
on each model of Macintosh involves a different challenge — I can’t provide
you with any step-by-step procedures in this chapter. Many online stores
include installation instructions with their hardware. Other sources for
installation instructions include the Apple Web site (www.apple.com) or
your Apple dealer. You can use Safari’s Google search feature to scan the
Internet for installation information for your particular model. However, here
are guidelines to follow during the installation:
✦Watch out for static electricity. When opening your Macintosh and 
handling hardware, make certain that you’ve touched a metal surface
beforehand to discharge any static electricity on your body. (You can

Installing Your New Stuff
578
also buy a static wrist strap that you can wear while working within the
bowels of your Mac.)
✦Check the notches on memory modules. Most types of memory mod-
ules have notches cut into the connector. These notches make sure that
you can install the module only one way, so make certain that they align
properly with the slot.
✦Make sure you’re using the right memory slot. As I mention earlier in
this chapter, most Macs have multiple memory slots, so check the label
on the circuit board to make sure that you’re adding the memory to the
correct slot. (Naturally, this won’t be a problem if you’re installing a
module into an unoccupied slot.)
✦Take good care of older hardware. If you replace an existing memory
module or hard drive with a new one, put the old hardware in the left-
over anti-static bag from your new hardware and immediately start
thinking of how you’ll word your eBay auction . . . Used 128MB Memory
Module for iMac G5, for example.
✦Check your hard drive jumper settings. If your Mac uses EIDE hard
drives, you must set the Master and Slave jumpers correctly on the back
(or underside) of the new drive. A jumper is simply a tiny metal-and-
plastic connector that is used to change the configuration on a hard
drive. Setting jumpers indicates to your Mac which drive is the primary
drive and which is the secondary drive. (I don’t know how engineers got
into the whole Master/Slave thing . . . they’re normally not quite so
exotic when naming things.)
If you’re adding a second drive to a G4 tower with an EIDE drive, you’ll
probably have to change the jumper settings on the original drive as
well. (If you’re replacing the existing drive, you’re in luck; simply dupli-
cate the jumper settings from the old drive and use them on the new
drive.) Because the configuration settings are different for each hard
drive model, check the drive’s documentation for the correct jumper
position.
✦Leave the cover off while testing. After you install the upgrade, leave
the cover off your Mac (if possible) while you boot the computer and
test to see how well you did. That way, if you have to replace the origi-
nal hardware for some reason, you won’t have to remove the cover a
second time.
To determine whether a memory upgrade was successful, you can again 
turn to the Apple System Profiler. Open the Profiler again and compare the
memory overview specifications with the original list that you made earlier.
If the total amount of memory has increased and the memory module is rec-
ognized, you’ve done your job well. If not, switch off the Mac and check the
module to make sure it’s completely seated in the slot.

A
pple’s list of successes continues to grow over the years — hardware,
applications, and (of course) Mac OS X — but the FireWire standard
for connecting computers to all sorts of different devices is in a class by
itself. That’s because FireWire has been universally accepted all over the
world as the port of choice for all sorts of digital devices that need a high-
speed connection. Even Windows owners have grudgingly admitted that
FireWire just plain rocks. Ya gotta love it.
In this chapter, I discuss the importance of FireWire to the digital hub that I
discuss in Book III, and I compare it with both version 1.1 and version 2.0 of
Intel’s Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection technology. I also talk trouble-
shooting and expansion using a hub.
Appreciating the Advantage of a FireWire Connection
So what’s so special about FireWire, anyway? Why does Apple stuff at least
one (and usually two) FireWire ports in all its current Macintosh models?
Heck, even the iPod (Apple’s MP3 player, which you can read more about in
Book III, Chapter 2) originally used only a FireWire connection. (Its official
name is IEEE 1394, but even the Cupertino crew doesn’t call it that — at
least very often.)
First things first. As countless racing fans will tell you, it’s all about the speed,
my friend. The original FireWire 400 port delivers a blazing fast 400 Mbps
(megabits per second), which is fast enough for all sorts of peripherals to

communicate with your Macintosh. The following list includes a number of
hardware toys that are well known for transferring prodigious file sizes:
✦Digital video (DV) camcorders
✦High-resolution digital cameras
✦Scanners and some printers
✦External hard drives and CD/DVD recorders
✦Networking between computers
For example, consider the sheer size of a typical digital video clip captured
by one of today’s DV camcorders. DV buffs commonly transfer several hun-
dred megabytes of footage to their computers at one time. Check out the rel-

Ouch! Not too hard to figure that one out. Here are three other important
benefits to FireWire:
✦Control over connection: This is a ten-cent term that engineers use,
meaning that you can control whatever gadget that you’ve connected
using FireWire from your computer. This is pretty neat when you think
about it; for example, you can control your DV camcorder from the com-
fort of your computer keyboard, just as if you were pressing the buttons
on the camcorder.
✦Hot-swapped: You don’t have to reboot your Mac or restart Mac OS X
every time that you plug (or unplug) a FireWire device. Instead, the
FireWire peripheral is automatically recognized (as long as the operat-
ing system has the correct driver) and ready to transfer.

USB and FireWire
Understanding USB and the Tale of Two Point Oh
581
✦Power through the port: FireWire can provide power to a device
through the same wire — typically, there’s enough power available for
an external drive or recorder — so you don’t need an external AC power
cord for some FireWire devices. (Apologies to owners of DV camcorders,
but those things eat power like a pig eats slop.)
However, FireWire isn’t finished evolving yet — the cleverly named IEEE 
1394 B (called FireWire 800 by anyone with any sense, including the folks at
Apple) delivers a whopping 800 Mbps. That, dear reader, oughta be fast
enough for both you and your loved ones. These ports only appear on the
top-of-the-line Apple desktop and laptop models at the time of this writing,
but if you can afford the best, you’ll have to wear racing goggles to use ’em.
Oh, and as you would expect from Apple, the new ports will be backward-
compatible with older FireWire hardware. However, the ports aren’t exactly
the same, so you’ll need a plastic port converter to connect FireWire 400
devices to a FireWire 800 port. (Such important little conversion fixtures are
commonly called dongles. No, I’m not making that up. Ask your favorite
techno-wizard.)
Understanding USB and the Tale of Two Point Oh
The other resident port on today’s Apple computers is the ubiquitous USB,
which is short for Universal Serial Bus. (By the way, ubiquitous means ever-
present or universal, which I quickly looked up by using my Dictionary
widget — read all about this super sleuth in Book I, Chapter 5.) Although 
version 1.1 of the USB standard is nowhere near as fast as FireWire, USB has
taken the world by storm. It’s used for everything from mice to keyboards,
speakers, digital cameras, and even external drives and CD recorders. (A
friend of mine never misses the chance to point out that USB — which was
originally developed by Intel, the makers of the Pentium 4 processor — was
given its first widespread implementation on the original iMac. You’re wel-
come, Intel.)
Unfortunately, those last two are somewhat problematical: Technically, you
can add a USB 1.1 external hard drive, but don’t expect response times any-
where near what you’d enjoy with an internal hard drive (think more along
the lines of a floppy drive). Ditto for a CD recorder — 4X is about the limit
for the recording speed with a USB 1.1 connection. (Don’t even think about
recording DVDs over a USB 1.1 connection.) Now, compare this performance
with that of similar equipment using a FireWire connection, which provides
nearly the speed of an internal hard drive and CD and DVD recording at the
fastest pace possible.

Hey, You Need a Hub!
582
Like FireWire, USB 1.1 connections are hot-swappable and provide power
over the connection. A USB 1.1 port also offers a more limited version of
Control over Connection as well, making it a good choice for virtually all digi-
tal cameras.
Not to be outdone, a new USB 2.0 specification arrived several years ago 
that delivers performance comparable to the original FireWire standard —
USB 2.0 can transfer 480 Mbps, although far less efficiently than FireWire, 
so the FireWire connection is still faster overall. These ports are backward-
compatible — meaning they work with the original USB 1.1 ports as well.
(Don’t call Apple a snob . . . at the time of this writing, all the Mac models in
Apple’s current stable have USB 2.0 ports.)
If you have an expandable tower G4 or G5 machine without USB 2.0 ports,
you can use an empty Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) slot to 
add those uber ports to your Mac. For example, Orange Micro sells the
OrangeUSB 2.0 Hi-Speed PCI card for about $50 (www.orangemicro.com);
you can add a USB 2.0 port to many older laptops by using a PC Card.
Hey, You Need a Hub!
Suppose that you’ve embraced FireWire and USB and you now have two USB
2.0 drives hanging off the rear end of your Mac — and suddenly you buy an
iPod. (Or you get another USB device that’s as much fun as an iPod, if that’s
actually possible.) Now you’re faced with too many devices for too few
ports. You could eject a drive and unhook it each time that you want to con-
nect your iPod, but there must be a more elegant way to connect. Help!
Enter the hub. Both the FireWire and USB specifications allow you to con-
nect a device called a hub, which is really nothing more than a glorified split-
ter adapter that provides you with additional ports. Note that this device
has nothing — repeat, absolutely nothing — to do with the network hubs that
I discuss in Book V. With a FireWire or USB hub at work, you do lose a port;
however, most hubs multiply that port into four or eight ports. Again, all this
is transparent, and you don’t need to hide anything up your sleeve. Adding a
hub is just as plug-and-play easy as adding a regular FireWire/USB device.
I should also mention that FireWire supports daisy-chaining — a word that
stretches all the way back to the days of the Atari and Commodore comput-
ers, when devices had extra ports in the back so that additional stuff could
be plugged in. However, not every FireWire drive has a daisy-chain port (also
called a passthru port). With daisy-chaining, you can theoretically add 63
FireWire devices to your Mac — talk about impressing them at your next
Mac user group meeting!

Port-o-rama: Using 
USB and FireWire
Uh, It’s Just Sitting There
583
Uh, It’s Just Sitting There
Man, I hate it when FireWire and USB devices act like boat anchors. FireWire
and USB peripherals are so doggone simple that when something goes wrong,
it really aggravates you. Fortunately, I’ve been down those roads many a
time before, so in this section, I’ll unleash my experience. (That sounds a
little frightening, but it’s a good thing. Really.)
Common FireWire and USB headaches
Because FireWire and USB are so alike in so many ways, I can handle possi-
ble troubleshooting solutions for both types of hardware at once:
✦Problem: Every time I turn off or unplug my external peripheral, Mac
OS X gets irritated and displays a nasty message saying that I haven’t
properly disconnected the device.
Solution: This happens because you haven’t ejected the peripheral. I
know that sounds a little strange for a device like an external hard drive
or a digital camera, but it’s essentially the same reasoning as ejecting a
CD or DVD from your Desktop. When you click your USB or FireWire
device and hold the mouse button down, you’ll see that the Trash icon
turns into an Eject icon; drag the device icon to the Eject icon and drop
it, and the external device disappears from your Desktop. (You can also
click the device icon to select it and press Ô+E. And don’t forget the
right-click menu if you have a two-button pointing thing . . . right-click
and choose Eject.) At that point, you’re safe to turn it off or unplug the
FireWire/USB cable.
If Leopard recognizes the device as an external drive, which is usually
the case with a digital camera, external hard drive, or external CD/DVD
recorder, you can simply click the Eject button next to the device icon in
the Finder window’s sidebar.
✦Problem: The device doesn’t show a power light.
Solution: Check to make sure that the power cable is connected —
unless, of course, you’ve got a device that’s powered through the con-
nection itself. This can sometimes pose its own share of problems, how-
ever, when using USB devices. Not all USB ports provide power because
some are designed only for connecting mice, keyboards, and joysticks.
To check whether an unpowered USB port is your problem, either con-
nect the device to a USB port on the back of your Mac or connect it to a
hub or another computer. If the device works when it’s connected to
another port, you’ve found the culprit.

Uh, It’s Just Sitting There
584
✦Problem: The device shows a power light but just doesn’t work.
Solution: This can be because of problems with your cable or your hub.
To check, borrow a friend’s cables and test to see whether the device
works. If you’re testing the hub, try connecting the device directly to
your Mac using the same cable to see whether it works without the hub.
If you’re attempting to connect a FireWire device through another
FireWire device, try connecting it directly to see whether it works. If so,
the middleman device either needs to be switched on to pass the data
through or it doesn’t support daisy-chaining at all — in which case,
you’ll have to connect both devices directly to your Macintosh.
✦Problem: Mac OS X reports that I have a missing driver.
Solution: Check the manufacturer’s Web site and download a new copy
of the USB or FireWire drivers for your device because they’ve been cor-
rupted, overwritten, or erased entirely. Because Mac OS X loads the
driver for a USB or FireWire device when it’s connected, sometimes just
unplugging and reconnecting a peripheral will do the trick.
Check those drivers
Speaking of drivers . . . old and worn-out drivers are a sore spot with me.
Drivers are simply programs that tell Mac OS X how to communicate with
your external device. Each new version of Mac OS X contains updated driv-
ers, but make certain that you check for new updates on a regular basis.
That means using both the Software Update feature in Mac OS X (which I
cover in Book II, Chapter 3) and going to the Web sites provided by your 
USB and FireWire hardware manufacturers.

O
f all the improvements made in Mac OS X over Mac OS 9, one of the
most important is the simplified printing process — no Chooser, no
strange printer ports . . . just a heap of Universal Serial Bus (USB) and net-
work printing goodness. As I discuss in Book I, Chapter 3, if your USB printer
is recognized by Leopard, you can print within seconds of plugging it in,
with no muss or fuss. A USB printer is connected physically to your Mac,
but you can also send print jobs over the network to a network printer 
or even to a wireless printer. (Unfortunately, if that network printer is in
another room, you do have to get out of your comfortable chair to retrieve
your printed document . . . not even Leopard is that powerful.)
But what if you want to print to an AppleTalk printer or perhaps send docu-
ments to a printer over TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol)? To take care of tasks like that, you need to dig a little further —
and I do so in this chapter. You also discover here how to use the features of
the System Preferences Print & Fax pane and how to juggle print jobs like a
circus performer.
Meet the Printer Browser
The Printer Browser runs automatically whenever it’s needed by Leopard,
but you can always summon it at any time by clicking the plus sign (or Add)
button on the Print & Fax pane within System Preferences.

Meet the Printer Browser
586
If your USB printer is already natively supported (has a preloaded driver in
Leopard), you might not need to go through the trouble of clicking the Add
button on the Print & Fax pane. Mac OS X can add a new USB printer auto-
matically, so don’t be surprised if your Mac swoops in and does it for you as
soon as you plug in a new printer. Also, the manufacturer’s installation pro-
gram for your printer might add the printer for you in a behind-the-scenes
way, even if Mac OS X lies dormant.
Although the Printer Browser doesn’t look like much (as shown in Figure
4-1), power lurks underneath.
Along the top of the Printer Browser, you’ll find seven default toolbar icons
that will display the different types of printer connections possible in
Leopard. From the Browser, you can add these printers to your system. The
seven buttons are
✦Default: Click this button to add or display the entry for the default
printer, which always appears in bold type.
To choose your default printer that you’ve already added, click the
Selected printer in Print Dialog pop-up menu in the Print & Fax list and
choose that printer. You can also choose the Last Printer Used option,
which automatically makes the default printer the last printer you used.
✦Fax: Click this button to add a fax connection as a printer selection. If
you don’t want to use Leopard’s built-in faxing system, you can print
directly to a third-party fax program, such as FAXstf X Pro (www.smith

micro.com), which then dials, connects, and sends the document to a
fax machine
✦IP Printer: Click this button to add a remote printer to your Mac
through an Internet connection or a local network connection. Sending 
a job to an Internet Protocol (IP) printer actually shoots the document
across a network or Internet connection by using a target IP address or
domain name. Generally, it’s best to have a static (unchanging) IP address
for a network printer; if the IP address changes often, for example, you’d
have to reconfigure your connection to your IP printer each time that it
changed
✦Windows: Click this button to add a shared printer that’s connected to a
PC on your local network. “Hey, I get to use the enemy’s printers, too?”
That’s right, as long as a Windows user on your network has shared his
printer (via the ubiquitous Windows File and Printer Sharing feature).
Sweet.
✦Bluetooth: Click this button to add a printer to your local Mac with a
Bluetooth wireless connection. (Naturally, the printer must be turned on
and must be within Bluetooth broadcast range, which is typically 30 feet
or less.)
✦AppleTalk: Click this button to add a printer running on your local
AppleTalk network. If you’re sharing a printer on another Mac by using
AppleTalk (or if you have an older printer that supports AppleTalk), you
can print to that device. For more on AppleTalk, read Book V, Chapter 3
✦More Printers: Click this button to add printers from other sources,
including Open Directory (using Mac OS X Directory Services) and spe-
cialized third-party printer drivers.
PDF printing for your big cat
Speaking of third-party Mac OS X printer driv-
ers, the most popular example of same is the
Adobe Acrobat printer driver, which is installed
by Adobe Acrobat and used to create elec-
tronic PDF documents. Although you certainly
can install Adobe Acrobat under Leopard, I’d
be remiss if I didn’t mention that you don’t have
to! That’s because the operating system pro-
vides built-in support for printing documents in
Adobe’s PDF format (which can then be viewed
and printed on any other computer with the
Acrobat Reader, or added to your Web site for
downloading).
In fact, you don’t even have to install a PDF print
driver or display the Printer Browser! To print a
document as a file in PDF format, click the PDF
drop-down button in the application’s Print
dialog, click Save as PDF from the menu, navi-
gate to the desired folder and enter a filename,
and then click Save.

Adding a Funky Printer
588
Oh, and there’s one additional important control on the toolbar that isn’t
actually a button: You can click in the Search field and type text to locate a
particular printer in any of these dialog lists. (Personally, I don’t have that
many printers on my network, but in a larger company, this field can save
you the trouble of scrolling through several pages of shared printers.)
Adding a Funky Printer
“And what,” you might ask, “is a funky printer?” Well, you have a number of
possibilities, but they all add up to a non-USB connection. (Remember, I said
that USB connections to a printer are generally automatic, or at least han-
dled by the printer’s installation software.) Some of the non-USB connections
I mention in the previous section include Windows shared printers, IP print-
ers, and Bluetooth printers.
No matter which type of funky printer you add, it needs a driver installed in
the Printers folder, which resides inside your Library folder. (A driver is a
software program provided by the printer manufacturer that tells Mac OS X
how to communicate with your printer.) Also, if the printer is PostScript-
compatible, it needs a Postscript Printer Description (PPD) file installed in
your PPD folder, which also appears in the Printers folder. Luckily, Leopard
comes complete with a long list of drivers and PPD files already installed and
available — bravo, Apple dudes and dudettes!
To add a funky printer, follow these steps:
1. Launch the manufacturer’s installation application, which should copy
the driver and PPD files for you.
If you have to do things the hard way, manually copy the driver file into
the Library/Printers folder and then copy the PPD file (if required) into
the Library/Printers/PPD folder.
2. If you’re adding a physical printer — instead of an application printer
driver — verify that the printer is turned on and accessible.
If you’re printing to a shared printer connected to another Mac or PC,
that computer has to be on. Luckily, most network printers (and their
computer hosts) remain on all the time.
3. Display the Print & Fax panel within System Preferences and click the
Add button (with the plus sign) on the Printing pane.
You’ll see the familiar Printer Browser. Shared printers using Bonjour
network technology should show up on the default list so you can click
the printer to select it.

4. To add an IP printer, click the IP Printer button on the browser 
toolbar.
Click the Protocol pop-up menu to choose the IP printing protocol (typi-
cally either IPP or the manufacturer-specific socket protocol). If you
have a choice, it’s always a good idea to use the manufacturer-specific
socket.
Click in the Address box and type the printer’s IP address or Domain
Name System (DNS) name, which should be provided by your network
administrator or the person running the print server. You can use the
default queue on the server — which I recommend — or select the Queue
text box and type a valid queue name for the server.
If you don’t know a valid queue name, you’re up a creek — hence, my
recommendation to use the default queue.
If you like, you can type a name and location for the remote printer —
this is purely for identification purposes. Finally, click the Print Using
pop-up menu, choose the brand and model of the remote printer, and
then click Add.
5. To add an AppleTalk, Bluetooth, or Windows printer, click the appro-
priate button on the Printer Browser toolbar. The settings that appear
depend on the connection type you choose. If you don’t know the cor-
rect choice, huddle with your network administrator.
• AppleTalk: If you choose AppleTalk, click the correct AppleTalk Zone
from the list on the left. After a scan of the specified Zone, Printer
Browser displays the list of printers that it can access from that Zone.
• Bluetooth: Choose Bluetooth to display a list of Bluetooth printers
that your Mac can recognize. (Remember, Bluetooth devices have a
practical range of only 20–30 feet.)
• Windows Printing: If you choose Windows Printing, click the correct
Windows workgroup that includes the printer(s) that you want to
use in the left column. After a scan of the specified workgroup,
Printer Browser displays the list of printers that it can access. (Don’t
forget to thank His Billness later.)
6. After everything is tuned correctly, click the Print Using pop-up menu
and choose the brand and model of the remote printer.
7. Click Add to complete the process and admire your new printer on
the Print & Fax panel in System Preferences.
You’ll also find the handy Printer Setup button in the Print & Fax panel —
when you click a printer that you’ve added to your list and click this button,
Leopard displays the model-specific configuration settings and features (if
any) that are available for the selected printer. Of course, these settings vary

for every printer produced by the hand of Man — they’re actually deter-
mined by the manufacturer’s printer driver — but they usually include actions
(such as cleaning and alignment) and settings (such as print quality).
Heck, Leopard even allows you to order supplies for your printer from the
comfort of System Preferences! Sure, you’ll pay a premium price, but think 
of the techno-nerd bragging rights you’ll enjoy at your next Mac user group
meeting! Click a printer in the Print & Fax panel and click the Supplies
button, and System Preferences automatically launches Safari with the
proper Web page from the Apple Store.
Managing Your Printing Jobs
You can also exercise some control over the documents — or, in technoid,
print jobs — that you send to your printer. To display the jobs that are active
(in line and preparing to print), open the Print & Fax pane in System Prefer-
ences and click the Print Queue button.
The actions that you can perform from the printer proxy window (as shown
in Figure 4-2) are
✦Delete: When you click a print job in the list and then click the Delete
icon, the print job is removed from the queue. You might need to delete
a print job if you discover a mistake in the document while printing.

If the job is currently printing, several additional pages might be printed
before the job is finally cancelled. In other words, information already
sent to the printer might have to be printed before the cancel request
can be processed.
✦Hold: Click the Hold toolbar icon to pause printing of the current print
job. The status of the print job changes to Hold.
✦Resume: Click a print job in Hold status in the list and then click the
Resume icon to resume printing.
✦Pause Printer: Click this icon to stop all printing to this printer. Note,
however, that unlike using the Delete command, Pause Printer doesn’t

Where’s the chapter on faxing?
Good question, and here’s the answer: Leopard
handles faxing so seamlessly that you don’t
need a chapter’s worth of instruction! As long
as your Mac has either an internal or external
analog (dialup) modem connected to a phone
line, you’re a lean faxing machine.
To fax any open document within an active
application, just choose File➪Print or press
Ô+P. Click the PDF button at the bottom of the
Print dialog and click Fax PDF. Either type a
telephone number directly in the To field, or
click the suave-looking button with the profile
next to the field and choose a contact with a
telephone number from your Address Book.
Next, type a dialing prefix if one is necessary to
reach an outside line.
If you need a spiffy-looking cover page, select
the Cover Page check box. Click in the Com-
ment box directly below it and type whatever
you like. You can optionally type a subject as
well. When all is ready, you can either click the
Preview button to see the fax before you send
it, or throw caution utterly to the wind and click
the Fax button. The Printer Browser treats a fax
just like any other printed document, so you can
cancel it or monitor its progress, as I discuss in
the section, “Managing Your Printing Jobs.”
Your Mac can also receive faxes. To enable this
feature, open System Preferences and click the
Print & Fax icon. On the Faxing tab, select the
Receive Faxes on This Computer check box.
Make sure that you type your fax number into
the My Fax Number field and then set the
number of rings Leopard should wait before
answering the call. You can save your incom-
ing faxes as files within a folder you specify, or
e-mail the contents automatically to any e-mail
address you like. (Perfect for vacations!) If you
like, you can even take the mundane route and
print them on your system printer.
If you’re going to use your Mac as a fax
machine often, I would definitely recommend
enabling the Show Fax Status in Menu Bar
check box. That way, you can monitor what’s
happening as your Mac sends and receives
throughout the day.

Sharing a Printer across That There Network

Printer icon morphs into Resume Printer — click it to restart all jobs in
the queue list.
This is a good feature to use when your printer is about to run out of
paper.
✦Utility: Click this icon to display any model-specific configuration set-
tings and features (if any) that are available for the printer assigned to
the selected queue.
✦Supply Levels: If your printer supports remote supply monitoring, you
can click this icon to display the current levels of ink and paper in your
printer. (Thus saving your feet from the wear and tear of walking.)
Sharing a Printer across That There Network
Before we leave the Island of Big X Printing, I’d like to show you how to share
a printer with others on your local network, using Leopard’s super-easy
Bonjour network sharing feature. (Earlier in this chapter, I showed you how
to connect to other shared printers around you. Here, you’re going to share
a printer that’s connected directly to your Mac.)
If you decide to share your printers, don’t be surprised if Mac OS X seems to
slow down slightly from time to time. This is because of the processing time
necessary for your Mac to store queued documents from other computers.
The hard drive activity on your Mac is likely to significantly increase as well.
Once again, turn to System Preferences! Click the Sharing icon, and click the
Printer Sharing check box to enable it. (When it comes to printing, Leopard
gives you more than one way to skin a . . . well, you get the idea, even with-
out the bad pun.) To share a printer, click the Sharing tab (as shown in
Figure 4-3) and select the desired printer in the list at the left to select it.
Enable the Share this printer check box. Voilà! You’re the guru!
“Hey, what about my firewall?” Perhaps you would if you were using that
Other Operating System — which shall remain nameless here — but you’re
using Leopard, and everything is set automatically for you the moment you
click the Printer Sharing check box! Leopard automatically opens the correct
port in your firewall to allow printer sharing (And yes, if you decide not to
share your printers and you disable the Printer Sharing check box later,
Leopard cleans up after you. It closes the port in your firewall for you.)
Super-flippin’ sweet.
The printers that you specify are available to other computers within the
same IP subnet. In other words, someone in your local network can use your
printers, but no one outside your network has access.

If you haven’t already assigned a printer a descriptive name, click the

appears and enter a descriptive name in the Name text field. You can also
identify that printer’s location in the Location text field. For example, in an

n Chapter 1 of this mini-book, I present you with an overview of the most
popular hardware that you can add to your Mac — and where there’s
hardware, software can’t be far behind. (Somebody famous said that — I
think it was either Bill Gates or Dennis Miller. I consider both of them famous
comedians.)
Anyway, Mac OS X comes with a full suite of software tools right out the box.
You get Internet connectivity, disk repair, a digital audio and video player,
basic image editing and cataloging, digital video editing, and — depending
on the price that you paid or the Mac model that you bought — even games,
and a complete set of productivity applications. However, if you’re willing to
pay for additional features and a manual (at least what passes for a manual
in the manufacturer’s opinion), you can make all these tasks easier and
accomplish them in even shorter time.
Read on for an overview to the most popular third-party software applica-
tions for Mac OS X: what everyone’s using, how much they cost, and why
they’re (usually) better. But before you drop a wad of cash on a fancy new
application, though, remember yet another of Mark’s Maxims:
If a program you already have does everything you really need — and
you like the way it works — you don’t have to upgrade. Honest and truly.™

The Trundling Microsoft Mammoth
Yes, I know I’ve been poking fun at His Gateness for much of this book — you
have to admit, he makes a pretty good target — but he did pull PC owners out
of the character-based world of DOS, and I’ll be the first to say that he does
get things right from time to time. (Witness my bestselling book PCs All-in-One
Desk Reference For Dummies [Wiley], soon to be revised for a 4th edition!)
For example, I’ve always been more impressed with Microsoft Office than
I’ve been with Microsoft Windows. (At least Windows XP Professional and
Windows Vista are steps in the right direction, but they still have a long way
to go to match Mac OS X.) Office has long been the productivity suite of
choice in the Windows world, and it’s also been a popular favorite in years
past on the Macintosh side.
A lot of hard work was put into the latest version of Microsoft Office, and it
shows. Office 2004 was designed specifically for Mac OS X, using the rules that
Apple recommends for the Aqua user interface. As you can see in Figure 5-1, it
looks as much like a native Mac OS X application as iWork, which is Apple’s
competing office productivity suite.

The Trundling Microsoft Mammoth

However, like Mac OS X itself, Office 2004 isn’t just an attractive exterior.
Consider some of the advantages of Office 2004:
✦Perfect document compatibility with the Windows version of Office:
You can both read and write documents with transparent ease, no
matter which platform gets the file. Documents can be shared between
platforms on the same network.
✦Mirrored commands: Office 2003 and Mac OS X Office 2004 share virtu-
ally identical menu items, dialogs, and settings, thus making Mac OS X
instantly familiar to anyone who’s used Office on a Windows PC. (Office
2007, however, is a different kettle of fish and bears little resemblance to
Office 2004 on the Mac.)
✦Support for native Aqua features: This includes transparent graphics
within your documents, input and confirmation sheets, and palettes for
formatting.
✦Tons of templates, samples, and support files: Microsoft doesn’t scrimp
on ready-to-use documents and templates, as well as additional fonts,
clip art, and Web samples.
✦Entourage: Entourage is the Macintosh counterpart to Windows Outlook.
It combines most of the same features that you’ll find in the Apple Mail,
iCal, and Address Book applications. (Read about Apple Mail in Book IV,
What about iWork?
If you’re already using iWork, you might have
noticed that the Office applications Publisher,
Word, and PowerPoint provide roughly the
same features. Therefore, you might wonder
whether you should scrap iWork.
Remember my maxim — if the iWork suite that
you’re familiar with is doing the job, I recom-
mend that you keep it. After all, iWork is a pow-
erful productivity suite on its own, capable of
producing results that are easily as good as or
better than Office 2004. Also, Apple provides
conversion filters that can allow you to open
and save Office documents so you’re not iso-
lated from the Office crowd.
On the other side of the coin, I would recom-
mend that you buy Office if
 You prefer the Office 2004 menu design and
features.
 You need applications like Excel and
Access. (The current version of iWork
doesn’t include spreadsheet or database
functionality.)
 You’d like to keep most of the same com-
mands replicated in the same places as the
Windows version of Office.
 You want to seamlessly share documents
with co-workers who use Windows Office
on your network or through e-mail.

Your Mac OS X Toolbox: TechTool Pro

Chapter 2; read about the Address Book in Book I, Chapter 6.) Use
Entourage to participate in Internet newsgroups; it also includes a
Mailing List Manager to help you keep track of the deluge of list mes-
sages that you receive every day.
Besides Entourage, Office 2004 on the Mac includes three other applications:
✦Word: The word processing application that rules the planet
✦Excel: The leading spreadsheet application
✦PowerPoint: A favorite presentation development application
The Office 2004 for Mac Professional Edition suite costs about $500 at the
time of this writing. You might save a few dollars if you buy it online from a
Web store like Mac Warehouse (www.cdw.com).
Your Mac OS X Toolbox: TechTool Pro
My favorite native Mac OS X disk repair application is TechTool Pro from
Micromat (www.micromat.com).
More than just about any other type of application, it’s important for a disk
maintenance program to be built “from the ground up” for Mac OS X. Never
attempt to repair a Mac OS X disk in Classic mode, nor should you try to use
an older repair utility that was written for use under Mac OS 9.
With TechTool Pro 4 (as shown in Figure 5-2), you can thoroughly check a
hard drive for both physical errors (such as faulty electronics or a bad sector
on the disk surface) and logical errors (incorrect folder data and glitches in
the file structure). The Disk Utility that’s included with Mac OS X does a fine
job of checking the latter, but it doesn’t perform the physical testing — and
TechTool Pro does both.
I should note, however, that TechTool Pro doesn’t take care of viruses. Pick
up a copy of VirusBarrier X4 (www.intego.com) to protect yourself against
viral attack.
TechTool Pro also takes care of disk optimization, which is a feature that’s
been conspicuously absent from Mac OS X ever since the beginning. As I
explain in Book I, Chapter 7, defragmenting your disk will result in better
performance and a faster system overall.
TechTool Pro 4, which will set you back about $100, comes on a self-booting
CD-ROM so you can easily fix your startup volume by booting your system
from the installation disc.

Image Editing for the Masses

Image Editing for the Masses
The only one true King of the Retouching Hill in Mac OS X, Adobe Photoshop
(www.adobe.com/products/photoshop) has been the digital-image edit-
ing favorite of Mac owners for many years now. Like Office 2004, the newest
version of Photoshop (CS3) also takes full advantage of the Aqua standard.
You can find more three-pound Photoshop books on the shelf than politi-
cians in trouble, so it’s no surprise that I can’t provide you with a sweeping
list of its features in this section. However, here’s a summary of what you
can expect from Adobe’s crown jewel:
✦Superior editing: The most sophisticated image editing possible for a
digital photograph. If you can accomplish an image-editing task in soft-
ware, it’s very likely that Photoshop can do it. You can even combine
and splice parts of different images to produce a new work of art or 
perhaps distort and liquefy an image to produce a new look.
✦Image retouching tools: These help you rescue images with problems,
such as overexposure and color imbalance. (You can also use tools like
the new Healing brush to erase imperfections in the photograph’s subject.)
✦Plug-ins: Photoshop has been a standard for plug-in functionality since it
first appeared. If you need features that aren’t in the application out of
the box, you can add them through third-party plug-ins.
✦Web posting: Prepare images for use on the Web.
✦Painting tools: Use these gems to simulate different types of inks,
paints, and brushes on different types of media.
Figure 5-2:

The Morass of Digital Video
600
Although Photoshop is a hefty $650 for the full package, Adobe has also cre-
ated a kid brother, Photoshop Elements, which sells for a mere $80. Designed
for the novice or intermediate level photographer, Elements has most of the
functionality of the full package that you’re likely to need. Elements also pro-
vides a number of very helpful wizards to help automate the most common
image-editing tasks, as well as one of the most comprehensive Help systems
that I’ve ever used.
The Morass of Digital Video
Two types of applications make up the DV market: digital video editing (in
which you create a movie) and DVD mastering (in which you take that movie
and create a DVD movie). You can find a number of great applications on the
market in both these categories, all at different price points and different
levels of complexity. They include
✦iMovie: I cover this easy-to-use video editing iApp in Book III, Chapter 4.
A good choice for any novice, it’s usually bundled for free with today’s
new Mac models, and you get it as part of the iLife suite. You might also
receive it with Mac OS X.
✦iDVD: This is the DVD mastering counterpart to iMovie. Although it’s a
snap to use, it doesn’t offer a lot of advanced features. (Book III, Chapter
5 explains iDVD in detail.) Again, you’ll receive it free with your Mac if
you bought a model with a SuperDrive.
✦DVD Studio Pro: Apple’s entry into the ranks of DVD mastering can pro-
duce a commercial-quality DVD movie disc, but don’t expect any hand-
holding or assistants with this application. This is a serious tool for
professionals, and as part of Apple’s Final Cut Studio, it’ll set you back
$1,300. With DVD Studio Pro 4 (www.apple.com/finalcutstudio/
dvdstudiopro), you can add interactive, animated menus, subtitles,
multiple audio tracks, and Web interactivity to your DVD projects.
✦Final Cut Pro 5: As another part of that uber $1,300 Final Cut Studio pack-
age, you’d assume Final Cut Pro (www.apple.com/finalcutstudio/
finalcutpro) to be the best DV editing package on the market for Mac
OS X . . . and you won’t get any argument from me. It offers real-time
playback with RT Extreme HD — no waiting for rendering, like you have
to within iMovie — and high-definition support over a FireWire connec-
tion. Sassy.
Yes, It’s Really Called “Toast”
Time to turn your attention to a subject near and dear to my heart: record-
ing data CDs, audio CDs, and DVDs on the Macintosh (which I cover in detail

in another of my For Dummies books, CD & DVD Recording For Dummies, 2nd
Edition (Wiley). Of course, Mac OS X can burn basic data CDs that you can
share with your Windows and UNIX friends without any add-on software. If
you have a Mac equipped with a SuperDrive, you can also create standard,
cross-platform data DVDs, too. But what if you need an exotic format, like CD
Extra, where data and digital audio tracks can co-exist peacefully on one
disc? Or perhaps you need a self-booting disc?
There’s one clear choice: When you’re ready to seriously burn, you’re ready
for Roxio Toast Titanium (www.roxio.com), the CD and DVD recording
choice for millions of Mac owners. (No snickering about the name, please.)
Figure 5-3 illustrates this powerhouse of an application, which is an elegant
design that’s both simple to use and perfectly Aqua. Files, folders, and digital
audio tracks that you want to record are simply dropped into the application
window.
As for exotic formats, here’s a list of what types of discs you can record with
Toast:
✦Standard data CDs and DVDs
✦Standard audio CDs
✦Video CDs
Figure 5-3:
Toast is the
classic Mac

✦MP3 discs (which store MP3 audio tracks)
✦Discs recorded from an image file
✦Mac volumes
✦Hybrid PC/Mac discs
✦ISO 9660 discs
✦Multisession discs
✦CD Extra discs
Toast works with both internal and external CD and DVD recorders, taking
advantage of the latest features on today’s drives — in particular, burn-proof
recording, which can practically eliminate recording errors. You can also
copy existing discs, using one or multiple drives.
Toast is quite affordable at $80. You can buy it directly from the Roxio online
store at www.roxio.com.
If You Positively Have to Run Windows . . .
Here’s where Mac power users usually start grinning from ear to ear like Santa’s
elves on the day after Christmas, because — get this — many of the great
Unwashed Windows Horde still actually think that you can’t run Windows on
a Macintosh! Can you believe that? Obviously, they haven’t heard of Boot
Camp, which is built into Leopard . . . but what if you don’t want to reboot to
switch operating systems? What if you need to share data between both Mac
and PC applications running simultaneously? Well, that’s where Parallels
Desktop from Parallels (www.parallels.com) comes in, which without a
doubt is one of the coolest applications ever written for the Mac.
No, my friend, your eyes aren’t deceiving you — you’re indeed looking at
Windows 2000 running on my MacBook in Figure 5-4. Parallels Desktop
(which requires Mac OS X) provides a near-perfect PC environment for any
version of Windows from 95 all the way up to XP; literally, Windows has no
idea that it’s not running on a typical piece of PC iron.
Parallels Desktop simulates everything necessary for you to get the full func-
tionality out of Windows. For example, this jewel automatically (and trans-
parently) handles your Windows Internet connection, network tasks, and CD
and DVD access. Heck, it even allows you to use your single-button mouse as
a two-button PC mouse (by holding down the Control key while you click).
You can run full-screen or run Windows in a window. (Pun joyfully intended.)

If that wasn’t enough, you can also run multiple operating systems. So, if you
need Linux or Windows 2000 along with your XP system, no problem — all it
takes is the install disc for those operating systems and the hard drive space
to hold ’em. Outstanding!
Naturally, performance is an issue — and, to be honest, Parallels Desktop
isn’t for the PC gamer, even with the newest Macs and their super-duper
GeForce and Radeon video cards. Because today’s PC games push an actual
PC to the limit, they just run too sluggishly on a Mac emulating a PC — they
do run, just slowly. (Also, virtually all of today’s blockbuster PC games are
also being ported to Mac OS X, so why not just run the Mac version?)
However, when it comes to just about any other type of application, Parallels
Desktop running on a late-model Intel-based Mac can deliver performance
equal to a Pentium 4 PC. The more memory that your Mac has, the more you
can give your virtual PC, so it also pays to have 512MB or more of RAM. (And
naturally, a dual-processor Mac runs Parallels Desktop much faster.) I use
this application with niche Windows programs that have never appeared on

the Mac as well as native Mac versions of all other applications. Again, you
don’t need to use Mac to run the Windows version of Photoshop CS3 because
Photoshop CS3 is also available for the Mac.
If you’re tired of the undeserved taunts from your clueless Windows friends —
you know, the ones who say that you can’t run both Mac and Windows pro-
grams at the same time — head to your browser and order a copy of Parallels
Desktop. The program is a very affordable $80 — don’t forget, you’ll have to
supply your own copy of Windows.
All Hail FileMaker Pro
If databases are the name of your game, you’ve already been using FileMaker
Pro for years (on both Mac and Windows, more than likely). For the uniniti-
ated, FileMaker Pro (www.filemakerpro.com) is the premier database cre-
ation, editing, and maintenance application for Mac OS X. It comes with
dozens of ready-made database templates for business, home, and education
use, or you can construct your own database in surprisingly short order.
Right out of the box, FileMaker Pro can create
✦Business databases and forms for inventory, personnel, purchase
orders, and product catalogs
✦Home databases for budgeting, recipes, music CDs, DVD movies, family
medical records, and event planning
✦Education databases for student records, expense reports, field trip
planning, book and multimedia libraries, and class scheduling
FileMaker Pro 8.5 can add images and multimedia to your database, and you
can quickly and easily publish your databases on your Web site by using one
of the built-in theme designs. (In fact, visitors to your Web site can update
your database online, if you like.) FileMaker Pro can also allow multiple
users to share data across your network, no matter whether they’re running
the Mac or Windows version.
At $299, FileMaker Pro 8.5 is one of the least expensive — and most powerful —
applications that you can buy for the Big X.
Utilities That Rock
The next stop on this Cavalcade of Software is an assortment of the absolute
best you’ve-got-to-get-this utility applications. Sooner or later, you’re likely
going to buy (or register) these utilities because you’ll use them every day.

StuffIt
In the Windows world, the Zip archive is the king of archiving formats. An
archive contains one or more compressed files that you can uncompress
whenever you need them. Folks store files in archives to save space on their
hard drives; archiving is also a neat way to package an entire folder’s worth
of files in a single convenient file, which you can attach to an e-mail message
or send via File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
On Planet Macintosh, the archiving format of choice is StuffIt. Manage your
archives with StuffIt Deluxe, from Allume Systems (www.allume.com).
StuffIt Deluxe can both archive and unarchive .sit files (the common name
for StuffIt archives) as well as Zip archives from your Windows friends. You
can also encrypt the contents of a StuffIt archive for those “sensitive” trans-
fers. The application runs $80 at the Allume Systems online Web store.
QuicKeys X3
QuicKeys X3, from Startly Technologies (www.startly.com), is another
example of someone’s thinking properly. This time, the idea is to automate
repetitive tasks by allowing Mac OS X to memorize what you do. Think of
QuicKeys X3 as a system-wide, macro playback application. Unlike AppleScript,
however, QuicKeys X3 works within any application and can play back mouse
movement and clicks/double-clicks. (And unlike Automator, you can perform
any action that you could normally perform within an application by typing.)
I’ve used QuicKeys X3 for a number of different tasks, including
✦Typing a commonly used block of text (like my address) into applica-
tions that don’t support macros
✦Launching applications at specific times and dates
✦Operating menus within programs to automate complex tasks
✦Launching Classic or choosing a specific startup disk with a single key
sequence
QuicKeys X3 sells for $80 on the Startly Technologies Web site.
BBEdit
Although we all know and love Mac OS X as a graphical operating system,
folks still need a powerful text editor for creating and modifying text files.
For example, software developers and Webmasters still use text editors 
daily to write applications or apply a quick fix to the HyperText Markup
Language (HTML) that makes up a Web page. (I use a text editor to make

606
minor changes to my Web site, MLC Books Online, without firing up a hor-
rendous Web design application. Talk about overkill!)
At first, you might think of TextEdit, which is the free application that ships
with Mac OS X. It’s not a bad editor, either, with features that are very similar
to Notepad in the Windows environment. However, serious text and code
editing requires a more powerful tool, and the text editor of choice for Mac
owners is universally considered to be BBEdit, from Bare Bones Software
(www.barebones.com). Figure 5-5 shows a document open within BBEdit 8.
Bare Bones Software pulls no punches in describing BBEdit — its advertising
still proclaims, “It doesn’t suck.” Gotta give Bare Bones credit; this incredibly
popular editor includes features like
✦Support for DOS/Windows, Mac, and UNIX text files: Yes, differences
do exist between the platforms, even with a so-called pure text file.
✦Works with text files over 2GB in size: Try that with TextEdit. Hmm . . .
on second thought, please don’t.

✦HTML tools for Web design: These tools include syntax checking and

✦grep pattern-based, multifile search and replace: In non-programmer/
non-UNIX English, that means a very sophisticated search-and-replace
function that can span more than one text file.
✦Syntax coloring: Use this to help you quickly locate commands and
qualifiers in programming languages.
✦Built-in FTP transfer commands: No need to launch a separate FTP
application: You can send your files right from within BBEdit.
You can even expand the functionality of BBEdit with plug-ins, many of
which are free extensions written by programmers and developers specifi-
cally for languages like C/C++, Java/JavaScript, Perl, and Pascal.
BBEdit 8.5 is available from the Bare Bones Software site for $125.
REALbasic
The final application that I want to mention really isn’t a utility as such; 
however, you can use it to write your own software, so I guess that it should
qualify. As an ex-COBOL programmer, reluctant Visual Basic shareware
developer, and recalcitrant dBASE coder, I can tell you that REALbasic (from
REAL Software) is definitely the easiest visual drag-and-drop programming
environment that I’ve ever used on a personal computer. If you want to
develop your own productivity applications, Mac OS X utilities, or — dare I
say it? your own game! — award-winning REALbasic 2006 is the way to go.
Development in REALbasic is as simple as designing the application window
by first simply adding controls, text, and multimedia wherever you like. Then
just fill in the blanks, like setting variables and specifying what happens
when the controls are triggered, by using a new implementation of the 
tried-and-true BASIC language. Of course, some programming knowledge is
required but far less than you’d need with Visual Basic. And the results look
as good as anything you can accomplish in those so-called real programming
languages.
Check out these features:
✦Cross-platform support so that you can write your program once and
compile it for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. Code it once; then
release three versions with no extra work — this is a very superb thing.
✦Support for all sorts of multimedia, including QuickTime.
✦Ability to animate and rotate text and objects, or tap the 3-D power of
QuickDraw3D and OpenGL graphics.

608
✦Capability to allow printing, network, and Internet communications
within your application.
✦Automation of Microsoft Office applications and connection of your
REALbasic application to business databases (like FileMaker Pro).
✦Completely royalty-free applications, so you can give them away or
release them as shareware.
REALbasic has been such a popular development tool on the Macintosh for
so many years that dozens of user-supported Web sites and mailing lists
have sprung up, offering all sorts of REALbasic plug-ins, tutorials, and
sample code for you to use in your own projects.
REALbasic 2006 comes in two versions — the Standard Edition ($99) and 
the Professional Edition ($500). You can order either version from the REAL
Software site at www.realsoftware.com.
At Least One Game
To be completely accurate, Mac OS X already comes with at least one game —
a very good version of chess, which I cover in the next section — but the
Macintosh has never been considered a true gaming platform by most com-
puter owners. Until recently, many popular Windows games were never
ported (or converted) for the Mac, and only the most expensive Mac models
had the one important component that determines the quality of today’s
games: a first-rate, 3-D video card.
However, within the last two years or so, all that has changed dramatically.
All of today’s Mac models feature muscle-car-quality video cards that use 
the NVIDIA GeForce or ATI Radeon chipsets; they can handle the most com-
plex 3-D graphics with ease. Match that with the renewed popularity of the
Macintosh as a home computer and the performance of the current crop of
Intel-based processors, and — wham! Suddenly you’ve got the best game
developers in the business — id Software (www.idsoftware.com) and
Blizzard (www.blizzard.com), to name two — releasing Macintosh ver-
sions of their newest games concurrently with the Windows version.
For the gamer in you, allow me to take you on a tour of the best of the new
generation of entertainment.
Mac OS X Chess
No mercenaries, no rail guns, and no cities to raze — but chess is still the
world’s most popular game, and Mac OS X even includes a little 3-D as well.
Figure 5-6 illustrates the Chess application at play; you’ll find it in your
Applications folder.

The game features speech recognition, move hints, take back (or undo) for
your last move, and a 2-D or 3-D board. You can also list your games in text
form and print them or save games in progress. Maybe it’s not a complete
set of bells and whistles like commercial chess games, but the price is right,
and the play can be quite challenging when you set it at the higher skill
levels.
World of WarCraft
I’ll end this chapter with Blizzard’s best: the online megahit that is World of
WarCraft. This MMORPG (short for massive multiplayer online role-playing
game) is yet another wrinkle in the popular WarCraft game series. World of
WarCraft puts the character you create in the boots of human princes, Orc
battle generals, undead champions, trolls, gnomes and elfin lords — in fact,
you can create multiple characters and play them as you choose. My recom-
mendation: Stick with the Undead, my friend.

Combat, however, is only half the job. By finishing quests and killing various
nasties, you earn experience, upgrade your armor and weapons, and build
reputation with various groups throughout the land. You can take to the air,
buy goods from mercenaries, or even discover a trade like leatherworking or
enchanting. Spells abound, and you can join a guild and chat with the new
friends you make online . . . I’ve played for over a year now, and I’m still
excited by this incredible game.
Control is by both keyboard and mouse; the game is easy to understand, but
you’ll always find someone to kick your posterior in battlegrounds or dun-
geons over the Internet.
You’ll pay about $50 online for World of WarCraft and then you’ll be charged
a set fee for each month’s subscription . . . and it’ll be worth every single
penny you spend. (Remember, this is a program you’d buy on your own; it
doesn’t come with your Mac or with Leopard.) For all the details and some

Chapter 1: . . . And UNIX 
Lurks Beneath
In This Chapter
 Why use UNIX?
 Doing things with the keyboard
 Introducing UNIX commands
 Creating text files
 Exploring deep inside Mac OS X
A
s I mention in the first chapter of the book — at the beginning of our
Leopard odyssey — UNIX lurks deep beneath the shiny Aqua exterior
of Mac OS X. UNIX is a tried-and-true operating system that’s been around
for decades, since the days when mainframe computers were king. If you
don’t believe that it’s a powerful (and popular) operating system, consider
that over half of all Web servers on the Internet use some variety of UNIX as
their operating system of choice.
Besides being battle-tested and having a long history, UNIX also offers some
fantastic features. Unlike the graphical world of Mac OS X, the keyboard
plays an integral role while you’re using a UNIX-based operating system.
Because UNIX is text-based, you’ll find that it’s evolved a large set of useful
keyboard-driven commands that can perform powerful feats that a mouse
user just can’t easily equal. This chapter examines the role of the keyboard
in UNIX operating systems and describes how to execute standard file
system commands. You also discover how to use Apple’s additional set of
commands and install your own commands (and simple programs) from the
Internet.
Why Use the Keyboard?
To begin benefiting from the UNIX underpinnings of Mac OS X, get used to
doing things with the keyboard. Although mouse skills can be applied to
UNIX, you’ll generally find performing UNIX functions faster and easier with
the keyboard.

Why Use the Keyboard?
614
UNIX keyboarding is fast
Why on Earth would any red-blooded Macintosh owner want to leave the
comfort of the mouse to use a keyboard? After all, the graphical user inter-
face is what made the Macintosh great in the first place. With the Finder, you
can navigate and manage the various files on your hard drive with a few
clicks. This sounds simple enough, but for some tasks, using the keyboard
can be just as fast, if not faster.
Suppose, for example, that you need to copy a file from somewhere on your
hard drive to somewhere else on that same drive. To do so with the Finder,
you must first open a Finder window (by clicking the Finder icon on the
Dock or by double-clicking a drive icon on your Desktop). Then, by using a
succession of mouse clicks, you navigate to where the file that you wish to
copy resides. Next, you might open another Finder window and navigate to
the folder where you wish to copy the file. (Note that opening the second
Finder window requires pressing Ô+N; clicking the Finder icon on the Dock
doesn’t open a second Finder window.) Finally, you duplicate the original file
and drag that copy to its intended destination.
Comparatively, by using the keyboard and the power of UNIX, you can
accomplish the same task with a one-line command. For some tasks, the
mouse is definitely the way to go, but you can perform some tasks just as
quickly, if not faster, with the keyboard. For the skinny on one-line com-
mands, skip down to the upcoming section “Uncovering the Terminal.”
The UNIX keyboard is a powerful beast
So maybe you’re not an expert typist, and using the mouse still sounds invit-
ing. For many scenarios, you’d be correct in assuming that a mouse can
handle the job just as quickly and easily as a bunch of commands that you
have to memorize. Using the keyboard, however, offers some other distinct
advantages over the mouse. To allow you to control your computer from the
keyboard, all UNIX operating systems offer the command line tool. With this
tool, you can enter commands one line at a time: hence, its name. Mac OS X
ships with the command line application, Terminal. You can find it here:
/Applications/Utilities/Terminal
One shining feature of the command line is its efficiency. To wit: When you
use a mouse, one mouse click is equal to one command. When you use the
command line, on the other hand, you aren’t limited to entering one com-
mand at a time; rather, you can combine commands into a kind of super-
command (minus the silly cape, but with bulging muscles intact), with each
command performing some action of the combined whole. By using the com-
mand line, you can string together a whole bunch of commands to do a very
complex task.

Why Use the Keyboard?

For example, consider how many times you’d have to click a mouse in the
Finder to do the following:
1. Find all files that begin with the letters MyDocument.
2. From this list of files, add a number to the beginning of the filename,
indicating its size in kilobytes.
3. Save the names of all altered files to a text file.
By using the command line, you could accomplish all these tasks by typing
only one super-command: that is, a collection of three simple commands
combined to form one instruction. The built-in Terminal program that ships
with Mac OS X Leopard gives you everything that you need to start using the
command line. I show you how in the section “Uncovering the Terminal,”
later in this chapter.
Delving further into super-commands isn’t for the faint-hearted; things get
pretty ugly pretty quickly, and this chapter can only show you the very
beginning of the UNIX Yellow Brick Road. Therefore, if your thirst for UNIX
dominance so compels you, I invite you to do a little independent study to
bone up on the operating system. Pick up a copy of the great book of lore
entitled UNIX For Dummies, 5th Edition, written by John R. Levine and
Margaret Levine Young (Wiley).
Go where no mouse has gone before
The Finder is generally a helpful thing, but it makes many assumptions 
about how you work. One of these assumptions is that you don’t have any
need to handle some of the files on your hard drive. As I mention in Book II,
Chapter 6, Mac OS X ships with its system files marked Off Limits, and I gen-
erally agree with that policy (which keeps anyone from screwing up the deli-
cate innards of Mac OS X). To secure your system files, Apple purposely
hides some files from view.
But what road do you take if you actually need to view or modify those
system files? Yep, you guessed it: The command line comes to the rescue!
You can use the command line to peer inside every nook and cranny of your
Mac’s vast directory structure on your hard drive. It also has the power to
edit files that aren’t normally accessible to you. With the command line, you
can pretend to be other users — even users with more permissions. By tem-
porarily acting as another more powerful user, you can perform actions with
the command line that would be impossible in the Finder. (Just remember to
make sure that you know exactly what you’re doing, or you’re working with
an Apple technical support person — a wrong move, and it’ll be time for an
Ominous Chord.)

Automate to elevate
If all these benefits are beginning to excite you, hold on to your socks! Not
only can you perform complex commands with the command line, you can
go even one step further: automation. If you find yourself using the same set
of commands more than once, you’re a likely candidate for using automation
to save time. Instead of typing the list of commands each time, you can save
them to a text file and execute the entire file with only one command. Now
that’s power!
Of course, you probably don’t like doing housekeeping tasks while you’re
busy on other things, so schedule that list of commands to run in the middle
of the night while you’re fast asleep. The command line lets you do that, too.
Note that automation of UNIX commands is totally separate from automation
of Mac OS X applications with AppleScript and Automator, which I cover in
Book VII, Chapter 2.
Remote control
“So, Mark, the command line is the cat’s meow for efficiently accessing and
working with files on my Mac, and I can use it to automate many operations.
Anything else?” I’m glad you asked! By using the command line, you can also
send commands to another computer anywhere in the world (as long as you
know the right login and password). After you log into another computer,
you can use the same commands for the remote computer.
UNIX was created with multiple users in mind. Because computers used to
be expensive (and honking huge machines to boot), UNIX was designed so
that multiple users could remotely use the same machine simultaneously. In
fact, if Mac OS X is your first encounter with UNIX, you might be surprised to
know that many UNIX beginners of the past weren’t even in the same room,
building, state, or even country as the computer that they were using.
Not only can you work with a computer that’s in a different physical loca-
tion, but it’s also very fast to do so. Instead of the bandwidth hog that is the
Internet, the command line is lean and mean. This permits you to use a
remote computer nearly as fast as if it were sitting on the desk in front of
you. (This is a great advantage for road warriors who need to tweak a Web,
an e-mail, or an FTP server from a continent away.)
Uncovering the Terminal
The best way to find out how to use command line is to jump right in. Mac
OS X comes stocked with an application named Terminal. The Terminal

Book VII
Chapter 1
. . . And UNIX Lurks

Uncovering the Terminal
617
application is where you enter commands in the command line. It’s located
in the Utilities folder within the Applications folder on your hard drive —
choose Applications➪Utilities.
Double-click the icon, as shown in Figure 1-1, to launch Terminal.
By the way, feel free to make Terminal more accessible by dragging its icon
to the Dock or the toolbar. That way, you won’t have to dive this deep into
the Applications folder in the future.
What’s a prompt?
Upon launch of the Terminal application, you’ll immediately notice some
text in the window that appears onscreen.
Last login: Sun Jun 23 17:51:14 on console
WHITEDRAGON:~ markchambers$
As you might guess, this text details the last time that you logged into the
Terminal. The last line, however, is the more important one. It’s called the
prompt.
The prompt serves some important functions. First, it lists the current direc-
tory, which is listed as ~. A tilde character (~) denotes a user’s Home direc-
tory. By default, you’re always in your Home folder each time that you begin
a new session on the Terminal. After the current directory, the Terminal dis-
plays the name of the current user, which is markchambers in this example.
Figure 1-1:
Find the
Terminal
application
in your
Utilities
folder.

Uncovering the Terminal
618
The final character of the prompt is a $. Consider this your cue because
immediately after this character is where you enter any command that you
wish to execute. Go ahead; don’t be shy. Try out your first command by
typing uptime in the Terminal application. (It’s a good idea to type UNIX
commands in lowercase.) Your text appears at the location of the cursor,
denoted by a small square. If you make a mistake while entering the com-
mand, press the Delete key to back up and then type the characters again. (If
the typing error is stuck deep in a longer command, press the left- or right-
arrow key to move the cursor immediately after the incorrect character and
press Delete to back up; then type the correct characters.) After you type
the command, press Return to execute it.
WHITEDRAGON:~ markchambers$ uptime
6:24PM  up  2:42, 4 users, load averages: 2.44, 2.38, 1.90
WHITEDRAGON:~ markchambers$
If all goes well, you should see a listing of how long your Mac has been run-
ning since the last reboot or login. In the example listing, the computer has
been running for 2 hours and 42 minutes (2:42 in line 2). Simple, eh?
Immediately following the listing of the uptime command, the Terminal dis-
plays another prompt for you to enter more commands. I examine many
more commands later in this chapter.
Click the toolbar button at the upper right of the Terminal window, and you
can choose the color combinations for the Terminal window background and
text. To hide the toolbar, click the toolbar button again.
A few commands to get started
Using the command line is simply a matter of entering simple instructions —
or commands — into the Terminal application and pressing Return to exe-
cute them. It’s easy to use the command line to navigate through the various
folders on your hard drive. You’ll become accustomed to using two vital
commands: ls and cd. The ls command is shorthand for list, and it does
just that: It lists the contents of the current directory. Enter ls at your prompt,
and you should see a listing of your Home folder.
The complementary cd command (lowercase) — which incidentally stands
for change directory — opens any folder that you specify. It works much the
same as double-clicking a folder in the Finder: The difference is that follow-
ing the cd command, you don’t immediately see all the folder’s content.
However, the cd command requires a parameter (extra options or informa-
tion that appear after the command) so that your Mac knows which folder to
open.

Book VII
Chapter 1
. . . And UNIX Lurks
Beneath
Uncovering the Terminal
619
For example, to open the Documents folder that resides in your Home direc-
tory, type cd Documents and press Return. When you do, you might be sur-
prised to see another prompt displayed immediately. So where are all the
files in the Documents folder? You must enter another command to see what
items are in the folder that you just opened. Type ls again to see the con-
tents of the Documents folder.
If you try to open a folder that has a space in its name, make sure to enclose
the folder’s name in quotes, like this:
cd “My Picture Folder”
Read more about using quotes in your commands in the upcoming section,
“Command line gotchas.”
To return to your Home folder, enter a modified version of the cd command:
cd ..
This causes your Mac to move back up the folder hierarchy one folder to
your Home directory. By using these three simple commands — ls, cd
foldername, and cd .. — you can traverse your entire hard drive.
After you successfully enter a command, you can recall it by pressing the up-
arrow key. Press the up-arrow key again to see the command prior to that, and
so forth. This is an extremely useful trick for retyping extra long file paths.
Using the skills you already have
Just because the Terminal is text-based doesn’t mean that it doesn’t act 
like a good Macintosh citizen. All the usual Mac features that you know and
love are there for you to use. Copy and Paste functions work as you might
expect — but only at the prompt position.
Drag-and-drop is also at your disposal. After you play around with the
Terminal for a while, you’ll find yourself bored to tears typing the long paths
that represent the files on your hard drive. To automatically enter the path
of a file or folder to a command, simply drag it to the active Terminal
window, as shown in Figure 1-2. The file’s full path instantly appears at the
location of your cursor. (Thanks, Apple!)
You can even use the mouse while entering commands in the Terminal. Click
and drag your mouse over text to select it. From there, you can copy to the
Clipboard as you might expect with any other application.

UNIX Commands 101
To use the command line effectively, familiarize yourself with the commands
that are available to you. After all, how can you use a tool without knowing
what it can do? Despite having to memorize a few commands, UNIX usually
makes it easy on you by abbreviating commands, by following a standard
grammar (so to speak), and by providing you with extensive documentation
for each command.
Anatomy of a UNIX command
UNIX commands can perform many amazing feats. Despite their vast abili-
ties, all commands follow a similar structure:
command <optional flag(s)> <optional operand(s)>
The simplest form of a UNIX command is the command itself. (For a basic
discussion on UNIX commands such as ls, see the earlier section, “A few
commands to get started.”) You can expand your use of the ls command by
appending various flags, which are settings that enable or disable optional
features for the command. Flags are preceded by a dash (-) and always
follow the command. For instance, you can display the contents of a direc-
tory as a column of names by tacking on an -l flag to the ls command.
ls –l
Besides flags, UNIX commands sometimes also have operands. An operand is
something that is acted upon. For example, instead of just entering the ls
Figure 1-2:

Finder
window into
Terminal to
display its
path.

Book VII
Chapter 1
. . . And UNIX Lurks
Beneath
UNIX Commands 101
621
command, which lists the current directory, you can add an operand to list a
specific directory:
ls ~/Documents/myProject/
The tilde (~) denotes the user’s Home directory.
Sometimes a command can take multiple operands, as is the case when you
copy a file. The two operands represent the source file and the destination of
the file that you want to copy, separated by a space. The following example
copies a text file from the Documents folder to the Desktop folder by using
the cp command (short for copy).
cp ~/Documents/MyDocument ~/Desktop/MyDocument
You can also combine flags and operands in the same command. This exam-
ple displays the contents of a specific folder in list format:
ls –l ~/Documents/myProject/
Command line gotchas
In earlier sections, I describe a few simple command line functions. All these
commands have something in common: You might not have noticed, but
every example thus far involved folder names and filenames that contained
only alphanumeric characters. Remember what happens if you have a folder
name that has a space in it? Try the following example, but don’t worry
when it won’t work.
The cd command stands for change directory.
cd /Desktop Folder
The result is an error message:
-bash: cd: /Desktop: No such file or directory
The problem is that a space character isn’t allowed in a path. To get around
this problem, simply enclose the path in double quotation marks, like this:
cd “/Desktop Folder”
Mac OS X lets you use either double or single quotation marks to enclose a
path with spaces in it. Standard UNIX operating systems, however, use
double quotation marks for this purpose.

UNIX Commands 101
622
In a similar vein, you can get the space character to be accepted by a com-
mand by adding an escape character. To escape a character, add a backslash
(\) immediately prior to the character in question. To illustrate, try the last
command with an escape character instead. Note that this time, no quota-
tion marks are necessary.
cd /Desktop\ Folder
You can use either quotes or escape characters because they’re 
interchangeable.
Help is on the way!
By now, you might be wondering how a computer techno-wizard is supposed
to keep all these commands straight. Fortunately, you can find generous doc-
umentation for nearly every command available to you. To access this built-
in help, use the man command. Using the man command (shorthand for
manual) will display a help file for any command that it knows about. For
example, to read the available help information for the ls command, simply
type man ls at the prompt. Figure 1-3 illustrates the result.
Autocompletion
To speed things along, the bash shell can automagically complete your
input for you while you type. Although the Terminal permits you to enter
Figure 1-3:
Use the
man
command to
display help
information.

Book VII
Chapter 1
. . . And UNIX Lurks
Beneath
Working with Files
623
commands via the keyboard, it is the shell that interprets those commands.
Many kinds of shells are available to UNIX users. The shell that Leopard uses
by default is bash — another common shell is tcsh. Use the autocomple-
tion features of bash to autocomplete both commands and filenames. To
demonstrate, begin by typing the following:
cd ~/De
Then press the Tab key. The result is that the shell predicts that you will
want to type
cd ~/Desktop/
Of course, if you have another folder that begins with the letters De in the
same folder, you might need to type a few additional characters. This gives
the autocompletion feature more information to help it decide which charac-
ters you want to type. In other words, if you don’t type enough characters,
autocompletion ends up like a detective without enough clues to figure
things out.
Working with Files
If you’ve used a computer for any time at all, you’re no doubt familiar with
the idea of files. Even before the first floppy drive appeared in personal com-
puters, operating systems have stored data in files . . . they date back to the
days when a mainframe computer occupied an entire floor of an office build-
ing. Mac OS X is no exception, and it’s important to understand how Mac 
OS X arranges them into folders and how you go about accessing them via
the command line. This section describes the basic file and folder informa-
tion that you need to know to tame the beast that is UNIX.
Paths
Before you dive into UNIX commands, you should first know a few facts . . .
nasty things, facts, but you can’t earn your pair of techno-wizard suspenders
without ’em. For starters, as a Mac user, you might not be familiar with how
paths work in UNIX. A path is simply a textual representation of a folder or
file. The simplest path is your Home directory, which is denoted by a tilde
character (~) — the tilde character acts as the equivalent of /Users/<your
short account name> (in my case, /Users/markchambers). Any folder
within the Home directory is represented by the folder’s name preceded by a
forward slash (/). For example, a document entitled myDoc that resides in
the current user’s Documents folder would have a path like this:
~/Documents/myDoc

Working with Files
624
Similarly, a folder named myFolder that resides in the current user’s
Documents folder would have a path like this:
~/Documents/myFolder/
As you’ve probably surmised, a folder and a directory are two different names
for the same thing. Folder is the name with which most Mac users are famil-
iar, and directory is a term that UNIX power users prefer. I use the terms
interchangeably throughout the remainder of the chapter.
Because Mac OS X is a multi-user environment, you might sometimes want
to work with folders or files somewhere other than in your Home folder.
Starting from your Home folder, enter the following command:
cd ..
This moves you to the folder right above your Home folder, which happens
to be the Users folder. Using another quick ls command will show you all
users who are permitted to use the machine. (By the way, Shared isn’t a 
user — it’s a folder with privileges set so that any user can access its 
contents.)
Enter cd .. once again, and you find yourself at the root of your main hard
drive. The root directory is what you see in the Finder when you double-click
your hard drive icon on the Desktop. A user’s Home directory is represented
by a tilde character (~), and the root of the hard drive is denoted by a for-
ward slash (/), as displayed by the prompt:
WHITEDRAGON:/ markchambers$
It’s easy to return to your Home directory by following this sequence:
WHITEDRAGON:/ markchambers$ cd Users
WHITEDRAGON:/Users markchambers$ cd markchambers
WHITEDRAGON:~ markchambers$
Here’s a faster way. Instead of moving through each successive folder until
you reach your intended destination, you can specify the path by using just
one cd command:
WHITEDRAGON:/ markchambers$ cd /Users/markchambers
WHITEDRAGON:~ markchambers$
Of course, the Home directory is a special folder in that you can also navi-
gate there by simply entering cd ~, but the main point here is that you can
navigate directly to specific folders by using that folder’s path in conjunction
with the cd command.

Book VII
Chapter 1
. . . And UNIX Lurks
Beneath
Working with Files
625
Furthermore, when you navigate your hard drive by using paths, you can
jump directly to your desired destination from any place. When you enter 
cd .., it is in relation to your current position, whereas entering
cd /Users/markchambers
will always take you to the same directory, regardless of your starting point.
Copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files
After you’re comfortable with moving around the hierarchy of your hard
drive, it’s a cinch to copy, move, and rename files and folders.
To copy files from the command line, use the cp command. Because using
the cp command will copy a file from one place to another, it requires two
operands: first the source and then the destination. For instance, to copy a
file from your Home folder to your Documents folder, use the cp command
like this:
cp ~/MyDocument ~/Desktop/MyDocument
Keep in mind that when you copy files, you must have proper permissions
to do so! Here’s what happens when I try to copy a file from my Desktop to
another user’s Desktop (strangely named fuadramses):
WHITEDRAGON:~ markchambers$ cp ~/Desktop/MyDocument/Users/fuadramses/Desktop/
MyDocument
Denied! Thwarted! Refused!
cp: /Users/fuadramses/Desktop/MyDocument: Permission denied
If you can’t copy to the destination that you desire, you will need to precede
the cp command with sudo. Using the sudo command allows you to per-
form functions as another user. The idea here is that the other user whom
you’re “emulating” has the necessary privileges to execute the desired copy
operation. When you execute the command, the command line asks you for
a password. If you don’t know what the password is, you probably shouldn’t
be using sudo. Your computer’s administrator should have given you an
appropriate password to use. After you enter the correct password, the com-
mand executes as desired.
In case you’re curious, sudo stands for set user and do. It sets the user to the
one that you specify and performs the command that follows the username.
sudo cp ~/Desktop/MyDocument /Users/fuadramses/Desktop/MyDocument
Password:

Working with Files
626
A close cousin to the cp (copy) command is the mv (move) command. As
you can probably guess, the mv command moves a folder or file from one
location to another. (I told you that all this character-based stuff would start
to make sense, didn’t I?) To demonstrate, this command moves MyDocument
from the Desktop folder to the current user’s Home folder:
mv ~/Desktop/MyDocument ~/MyDocument
Ah, but here’s the hidden surprise: The mv command also functions as a
rename command. For instance, to rename a file MyDocument on the
Desktop to MyNewDocument, do this:
mv ~/Desktop/MyDocument ~/Desktop/MyNewDocument
In this case, you can see that the mv command is really copying the original
file to the destination and then deleting the original. Because both folders in
this example reside in the same folder (~/Desktop/), it appears as though
the mv command has renamed the file.
Again, like the cp command, the mv command requires that you have proper
permissions for the action that you wish to perform. Use the sudo command
to perform any commands that your current user (as displayed in the prompt)
isn’t allowed to execute. On UNIX systems, not all users are necessarily
equal. Some users can perform functions that others can’t. This is handy for
keeping your child’s mitts out of important files on your computer. It also
creates a hurdle should you choose to work on files while using your child’s
restricted user account. The sudo command lets you temporarily become
another user — presumably one that has permission to perform some func-
tion that the current user can’t.
What would file manipulation be without the ability to delete files? Never
fear; UNIX can delete anything that you throw at it. Use the rm (short for
remove) or rmdir (short for remove directory) command to delete a folder
or file. For example, to delete MyNewDocument from the Desktop folder, exe-
cute the rm command like this:
rm ~/Desktop/MyNewDocument
Once again, deleting files and folders requires that you have permission to
do so. In other words, any time that you manipulate files with the command
line, you’re required to have the proper permission. If your current user
lacks these permissions, using sudo helps.

Useful Commands
627
Opening documents and launching applications
Launching applications and opening documents is child’s play for a UNIX pro
like you. The open command does it all. For example, to bring the Finder to
the foreground without touching the mouse, use
open /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app
To open a document from the command line, follow a similar scheme. For
example, to view an image named myImage.tif that’s stored in your
Documents folder using Preview, try this:
open ~/Documents/myImage.tif
Useful Commands
Manipulating files and viewing folder content is fun, but the command line is
capable of so much more! Now I focus your attention on some of the other
useful tasks that you can perform with the command line.
Mac OS X comes stocked with a full set of useful commands. You can dis-
cover what commands are installed by viewing the files in /usr/bin. Type
cd /usr/bin to navigate there.
Calendar
One of my favorite command line functions is the cal command, which dis-
plays a calendar in text form. Simply entering cal at the prompt displays a
calendar for the current month, as shown in Figure 1-4.
Figure 1-4:
Type cal
to view a
calendar for
the current
month.

Useful Commands
628
Append a number to the cal command to display a 12-month calendar for
that year. The number that follows the cal command is the year for which
you’d like to see a calendar. For example, to view a calendar for 1970, type
cal 1970. The result appears in Figure 1-5.
Append a month number and a year number to display the calendar for that
month. For example, to view a calendar for April 2007, type cal 04 2007.
Another useful command that’s related to the cal command is date. Type
date at the command line to display the day, date, time, and year based on
your computer’s settings.

Processes
Have you ever been curious as to why your hard drive seems to spin and
grind on occasion while your system is seemingly inactive? Mac OS X some-
times has a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes. To discover just what
your computer is busy doing at any time, use the top command to display
all the actions that your computer is currently performing, as shown in
Figure 1-6. These activities are called processes; some are created when you
launch applications, and others are simply tasks that Mac OS X has to take
care of to keep things running smoothly.

Useful Commands
629
Besides listing the names of the various processes currently in use, top also
tells you how much of your CPU is being devoted to each process. This lets
you know what process is currently hogging all your computing power.
Sometimes a process stalls, effectively freezing that action. By using the top
command to find the Process ID (PID) of the offending process, you can halt
the process. Simply use the kill command followed by the PID of the
process that you want to stop.
Do not go killing processes with a cavalier attitude! Although Mac OS X 
is extremely stable, removing the wrong process — such as init or
mach_init — is rather like removing a leg from one of those deep-sea
drilling platforms: the very definition of Not Good. You could lock up your
system and lose whatever you’re doing in other applications. If you simply
want to shut down a misbehaving program, go graphical again (at least for a
moment) and use the Force Quit menu command from the Finder menu.
Like top, another handy command for examining process info is ps (short
for process). Most often, you’ll want to append a few flags to the ps com-
mand to get the information that you desire. For example, try the following
command:
ps –aux
Figure 1-6:

The man page for ps explains what each flag means. (Read more about using

UNIX Cadillac Commands
Besides working with files and processes, the command line has all kinds of
sophisticated commands. For example, with the command line, you have
instant access to a variety of tools for finding files or even stringing together
commands.
Finding files
The command line also gives you a number of ways to search for files on
your hard drive. The two most commonly used commands are find and
locate.
To use find, specify a starting point for the search followed by the name of
the file or folder that you wish to find. For example, to find the Fonts folder
that belongs to your user, enter the command like this:
find ~/ -name “Fonts”
You should see at least one result of the find command.
/Users/markchambers//Library/Fonts
One great feature of the find command is that you can look for a file or
folder in more than one location. Suppose you want to find a file named
MyDocument that you know resides either in your Documents folder or on
your Desktop. For this kind of search, use the find command like this:
find ~/Documents ~/Desktop\ Folder -name “MyDocument”
In this example, you are telling the find command which folders it should
search when looking for the file named MyDocument.
Using pipes
Nearly all UNIX commands can take on greater abilities by using a construct
called the pipe. A pipe (|) is represented by that funny little vertical line that
shows up when you press Shift+\. The pipe routes data from one command
to another one that follows — for example, many UNIX commands produce
large amounts of information that can’t all fit on one page. (You might have
noticed this behavior when you used the locate command.) Joining two
commands or functions together with the pipe command is piping. To tame

631
the screens full of text, pipe the find function to the less command. The
less command provides data one page at a time.
find ~/ -name “Fonts” | less
When the results fill up one page, the data stops and waits for you to press
any key (except the Q key) to continue. When you reach the end of the
results, press Q to quit and return to a command line prompt.
UNIX Programs That Come in Handy
As a Macintosh user, you might be surprised to know that many applications
on your hard drive don’t reside in one of the typical Applications folders of
Mac OS X. These applications, in fact, don’t have any graphical user inter-
face like you’re accustomed to. They’re accessible only from the command
line. The remainder of this chapter covers some of these applications.
Text editors
UNIX has many text-editing applications for use at the command line. Some
of the more popular ones include pico, vi, and emacs. Each of these text
editors has its pros and cons — and thanks to the thorough folks at Apple,
because all three are included with Leopard! For my examples here, how-
ever, I use pico because it’s simple to use and sufficient for our needs.
Creating a new document
To create a text file by using pico, simply type pico at the command line.
The result looks like Figure 1-7.
This is the rough and tumble world of UNIX, which preceded the Macintosh
by many years. Perhaps this will also help you to appreciate why the Macin-
tosh was so revolutionary when it was introduced. (You can just hear the
designers crowing, “We’ll call this a menu! Yeah, that’s the ticket!” The only
graphics that you’d see on your monitor were the comics and sticky notes
that you stuck to the bottom.)
At the bottom of the screen is a menu of common commands. Above the
menu is a large, empty space where you can enter text, much like the word
processors that you already know and love. (For those of us that remember
the halcyon character-based days of DOS, think older versions of Word and
WordPerfect . . . or, if you’re a real computing dinosaur like I am, consider
the original WordStar.) Type some text in that area. Anything will do . . . a
letter to a friend, a grocery list, or your school homework.

632
When you’re finished entering your desired text, save the document with the
WriteOut command in the pico menu. Directly next to each command in
the pico menu is a keyboard sequence used to perform that command.
(Refer to the bottom of Figure 1-7.) The ^ character is shorthand for the
Control key on your keyboard. Thus, to save a file, press Control+O. This
flies in the face of standard Mac keyboard conventions, where the letter O is
traditionally used to mean Open.
After pressing the Control+O sequence, pico prompts you for a filename.
Like most UNIX files, you’re permitted to enter a simple filename here or a
full path to a file. For this example, save the file to your Documents folder,
naming it MyPicoDocument.
After you’ve completed and saved the document, pressing Control+X will
transport you away from Planet Pico and back to the command line.
Networking with the Terminal
Because UNIX isn’t a new phenomenon, it has many useful networking abili-
ties built into it. In fact, UNIX was instrumental in creating much of what we
now take for granted: e-mail, the Internet, and the World Wide Web. Thus,
you’ll be happy to know that you can communicate over networks with the
Terminal in practically any manner that you can dream of . . . and then some!

WWW and FTP
If you’ve used the Internet for any time, you’re probably familiar with the
various means to transport data over a network. From FTP (short for File
Transfer Protocol) and Telnet to e-mail and the Web, UNIX can handle it all. In
fact, UNIX has a command for each of these functions (and many more that
have passed into historical obscurity). Rather than use each individual com-
mand to send and retrieve data with the Terminal, Apple has conveniently
provided a command that can handle them all: curl. The curl command is
competent at all the standard network protocols. To see it in action, pass a
Web address (or URL, to The Enlightened) to the curl command:
curl http://www.mlcbooks.com
The result is that you see the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) page
that’s located at www.mlcbooks.com. Because this isn’t particularly useful
for most people (it’s not very easy to read), you need to add the letter o as a
flag. This specifies where you would like to save this file upon download. To
save the HTML page to your Home directory, add the -o flag and a path to
the destination file.
Don’t forget to precede all flags with a hyphen. For this example, it would be -o.
curl -o ~/mlcbooks.html http://www.mlcbooks.com
If you now perform an ls command, you see that curl has, in fact, down-
loaded the HTML found at www.mlcbooks.com and saved it to a file named
mlcbooks.html in your Home directory.
The beauty of curl is that it does much more than just retrieve Web pages:
It’s equally comfortable with FTP transfers. FTP is used to download (or
receive) files from a server as well as upload (or send) them. Like the previ-
ous HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) examples, you only have to provide
an FTP address in Uniform Resource Locator (URL) format, and curl will
take care of the rest. Of course, most people want to save any files that they
download via FTP — not view them in the Terminal like I did the HTML file.
Therefore, like the previous example, you should add the -o flag and a path
to the destination of your download. This time, I download a README file
about curl directly from the makers of curl.
curl -o ~/Desktop/README.curl ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/www/utilities/curl/
README.curl
If you’re familiar with FTP, you might be wondering whether curl can
upload, too. Yes, indeed! Instead of using the -o flag, you need to use two
flags: -T and -u. The -T flag denotes which file you wish to upload. The -u
flag denotes the username and password. Then, specify the FTP destination

UNIX Programs That Come in Handy
634
address of where you want to upload it. Because this example deals with an
upload, the remainder of this example is for an imaginary FTP server. In real
life, you’d use the appropriate FTP address, username, and password for an
FTP server where you are allowed to upload.
curl -T /Desktop/README.curl -u username:passwd ftp://ftp.yoursitehere.com
/myfiles/README.curl
This example uploads the README.curl file from the Desktop folder that I
downloaded earlier to an imaginary FTP server.
How do you spell success? C-u-r-l!
Sure, HTTP and FTP are handy, but did you know that there are many other
protocols for network communications? One of the niftier ones is the
Dictionary protocol. With it, you can look up words from any server that
understands the protocol. Suppose, for example, that you would like to know
the meaning of the term DVD. Enter the following command to find out:
curl dict://dict.org/d:DVD
With curl, Dictionary, and your Dictionary Dashboard widget on the same
Macintosh, you might never use a “real” paper dictionary again!

U
sing a Macintosh is supposed to make your life easier — and in many
ways, it does. But there’s a limit to how much your Mac can do by
itself, right? After all, you still have to move the mouse, press keys on the
keyboard, and read information on the screen to get things done . . . or do
you? Why not let your computer do the dull chores — such as renaming a
thousand digital photographs from your family vacation and organizing
them into folders based on the subject of each photo — for you? Although
most people are familiar with controlling their Macs with the mouse and
keyboard, few realize that they can operate their machines without touching
a key, a mouse button, or even glancing at the screen.
What’s So Great about AppleScript?
If one word could describe what AppleScript is all about, it’d be automation.
AppleScript is a technology for automating practically any action that you
perform with your Macintosh, including both common tasks in the Finder
and those that you perform in other applications.
Automate common tasks in the Finder
If you’ve ever found yourself repeating some task more than once, you’re 
an ideal candidate for becoming an AppleScript techno-wizard. AppleScript
is particularly good at taking the boredom and tedium out of using your
Macintosh by performing all sorts of tasks automatically. To illustrate, con-
sider a few jobs that would take a fair amount of time to do by hand but are
a snap with AppleScript:

What’s So Great about AppleScript?
636
✦While writing your next best-selling Great American Novel — or For
Dummies book on Mac OS X — you make a mistake and misnumber the
chapters. All the chapters have a filename bearing the chapter number,
but they’re all off by one. Sure, you could rename each file by hand, but
your book is a large tome and renumbering 42 chapters manually doesn’t
sound like much fun. (Take my word for it. Please.) It’ll require several
minutes and lots of tedious attention on your part, not to mention intro-
duce the likelihood of human error. But wait, there’s another way! When
using a simple AppleScript of only a few lines of code, you can rename
the chapters in seconds whilst you go grab another Diet Coke.
✦You’re a neat individual and think that your Mac should reflect your pen-
chant for order — in fact, you like your Desktop icons to be placed just
so. Being left-handed, you prefer the icons over on the left side of the
Desktop, like some of those inferior operating systems. In this situation,
an AppleScript can help you do things that aren’t humanly possible; not
only can you rapidly rearrange the icons on your Desktop, but you can
do so with pixel-point accuracy. Without AppleScript, it’d be nearly
impossible to precisely align dozens of icons. And if you could, it would
take a long time and probably cause you to go blind.
✦After a font-download binge, you find yourself with hundreds of fonts.
You really want to organize them into separate folders based on the date
that you downloaded them. AppleScript comes to the rescue again! With
a brief script, you could knock out this challenge without ever looking at
a single date. Add a couple more lines of code to the script, and Apple-
Script will take care of creating the folders, too. Right, you know the
word: sassy.
Automate tasks in other applications
By using AppleScript, you can also often automate your work from beginning
to end, despite the fact that you need multiple applications to do so. Look at
a few scenarios, and you’ll begin to appreciate why AppleScript is such a
powerful technology:
✦You’ve just completed creating the ultimate library of bagpipe songs in
iTunes — no, really! — and you want to share the list with your friends
at the next Bagpipers Anonymous meeting. You could easily send every-
one in the group an iTunes Playlist, but not everyone in the club has a
Macintosh, let alone a computer. This is going to require creating a hard
copy for those members without a computer. Because your bagpipe song
list contains thousands of songs, you don’t want to retype the name of
each song. AppleScript can save the day by extracting the song titles for
you and compiling them into a list just in time for your meeting.

✦AppleScript can take care of your computer-owning bagpipe friends, too.
With a few extra steps, you can e-mail all of them the list as well.
✦Being so doggone fond of bagpipes, you want to send your bagpiping
friends a special note during the holidays. To help manage your holiday
greeting cards, you can create a record in FileMaker Pro or some other
database listing the name and address of each person who should
receive a card. If you’ve entered their street addresses in the Contacts
section of your e-mail application, AppleScript can aid in transferring the
addresses from your e-mail application to the database. Never again will
your bagpiping friends miss a holiday greeting . . . and the world is a
much better place.
As you can imagine, there are literally thousands of ways that you can use
AppleScript to automate your workflow.
Running a Script
The easiest way to get started with AppleScript is to use some scripts that
others have written already. Scripts are small files that contain a list of com-
mands; this list of commands tells your Mac what function to perform and
when to perform it. Fortunately, Apple is kind enough to provide you with
several completed scripts with your installation of Leopard. You can find a
large cache of scripts in the scripts folder, found in the Library folder, under
Scripts.
Many scripts (but not all) end with the extension .scpt. Before you get
started running scripts, however, you should know a few things first.
Identifying scripts in the field
Each script that you encounter will be in one of these three formats:
✦Script application: Some AppleScripts act much like an application. To
use one, simply double-click it in the Finder, and off it goes to perform
whatever tasks it was meant to do. Depending on an internal setting of
the script, it might quit when it’s finished doing its thing. Most often, the
script completes its mission and quits. Scripts are typically identified by
the icon that you see in Figure 2-1.
✦Compiled script: You might also encounter AppleScripts that won’t run
without the aid of another application. Apple calls these compiled
scripts. Although they can’t execute on their own, they do have the abili-
ties of a script built in. They just require a host application to use them.

Running a Script
638
✦Text file: In addition to compiled scripts and those that act like applica-
tions, a third category of AppleScript that you might encounter is a
script stored in a text file. Scripts that are stored in a text file also need a
host application before they’ll do anything. The main difference between
a text file script and a compiled script is that you can read a text file
script with any application that can open a text file.
The Script Editor application
Two of the three possible script types (compiled scripts and text files)
require some sort of host application before they’ll perform any action.
Luckily, Leopard provides you with just such a host: the AppleScript Script
Editor application, which comes with Mac OS X and can execute any
AppleScript with ease. With the Script Editor, you can also do much more,
including
✦View or modify an AppleScript
✦Create a new AppleScript
✦Check an AppleScript for errors
✦Save scripts in one of the three possible formats
To launch the Script Editor application, navigate to the AppleScript folder
(open your Applications folder, then open the AppleScript folder) and
double-click the Script Editor icon. The Script Editor application displays an
empty, script-editing window, as shown in Figure 2-2.

Executing a script
After you have the Script Editor application running, you can run any
AppleScript that you can find. To get you started, Apple has conveniently
provided a handful of useful scripts. Navigate to the Scripts folder, which is
located in the Library folder.
The scripts are divided into folders based on functionality, such as fonts,
mail, color, and navigation. For example, open the Internet Services folder,
where you’ll find a script named Current Temperature by Zipcode.
scpt. You need an active Internet connection to test this script.
Double-click the script to open it. Because it’s a compiled script and not 
an application script, the Script Editor automatically loads the script and
comes to the foreground (see Figure 2-3). This particular script prompts
users for their ZIP code and then displays the current temperature, which it
retrieves from a Web site. To see the script in action, click the Run button or
press Ô+R.

Writing Your Own Simple Scripts
Using someone else’s scripts is fun and all, but the real joy of AppleScript
comes when you create your own. Not only can you customize a script to
your own needs and desires, but saving all those keystrokes can really pro-
duce a feeling of euphoria. (Okay, perhaps just Leopard power users will
actually experience a heightened sense of existence . . . you’ll be there soon.)
Create a script without touching a key
You needn’t wear a pocket protector or tape the bridge of your glasses to
become proficient with AppleScript. In fact, the Script Editor can get you up
and running with AppleScript in no time at all. The secret weapon of the
AppleScript author is the Record function of the Script Editor. You click the
Record button, perform one or more actions in a recordable application, and
then return to the Script Editor where you click the Stop button. The Script
Editor stores each of your actions and compiles the whole list into an
AppleScript.

In theory, this is how it should all work, but in reality, finding recordable
Macintosh applications isn’t always so easy. The Finder is, perhaps, the most
recordable application on the Mac. Although some other applications sup-
port recording, so few do that the Finder could be the only recordable appli-
cation most Mac users ever see.
To try it yourself, do the following steps to automate actions in the Finder:
1. Bring Script Editor to the foreground.
If Script Editor isn’t currently running, double-click its icon in the Finder.
If it is running, click its icon on the Dock.
2. Create a new script by pressing Ô+N.
3. Click the Record button.
The Record button is one of four buttons positioned near the top left of
a new script window. Refer to Figure 2-3.
4. Switch to the Finder and perform the actions that you want to 
automate.
When the Finder is active, you can select some icons on the Desktop and
move them around, resize any open Finder windows, or navigate to your
home directory. Any action that you perform in the Finder should be
acceptable fodder for the Script Editor. When you perform tasks in the
Finder, the Script Editor automatically generates a script that replicates
your actions.
5. Return to the Script Editor and click the Stop button.
To reactivate the Script Editor, click its icon on the Dock. Click the Stop
button to cease the recording of your script.
When you’re finished, you should be looking at a complete AppleScript. To
test your work, return to the Finder and revert any icons or windows that
you might have moved or repositioned. (You don’t want to run a script that
doesn’t appear to have any effect.) Then return to the Script Editor and click
the Run button to watch your automated Finder tasks being performed.
Building your own scripts
An AppleScript novice can perform all kinds of amazing feats with the
recording features of the Script Editor. Because AppleScript uses a kind of
pseudo-English language, it’s usually pretty easy to figure out what’s going
on behind the scenes. Consider the following script for an example:

One Step Beyond: AppleScript Programming
642
tell app “Finder”
activate
set windowList to every window --save list of open windows
repeat with theWindow in windowList
tell theWindow
if collapsed is true then
--do nothing, because the window is collapsed
else
set collapsed to true
end if
end tell
end repeat
end tell
(By the way, in the preceding code, I bolded and italicized the commands
you’ll be working with, but they don’t have to be bolded for the script to
work.) Anyway, the first thing that you might notice about this script is the
first line: the tell command, which indicates that this script relates to the
Finder. This script activates the Finder, creates a list of open windows, and
then examines the state of each window: Is it collapsed or not collapsed? (In
Leopard, a collapsed, or minimized, window appears on the Dock.)
One of two possible results occurs:
✦If the window is already minimized and on the Dock, nothing happens
and the script continues through the list of windows.
✦If the window isn’t minimized, the script collapses it.
This continues until the script has examined all open windows. The end
result? All open windows end up minimized on the Dock.
Another thing to note about this script is that it has two comments in it
(save list and do nothing). Comments can help you remember what you
were thinking months later when you open the script again. Although com-
ments help us humans know what’s happening, they don’t really have any
other function. An AppleScript comment begins with two dashes (- -).
Here’s a big-time Mark’s Maxim that every script author should remember:
Comments are your friend!™

needn’t be a software developer to take advantage of AppleScripts. Apple
provides a lot of help to get you started along the AppleScript trail.
Grab the Dictionary
Perhaps the greatest resource for AppleScript novices and experts alike 
is the AppleScript Dictionary. Although many applications are scriptable, 
not all are. To be scriptable, an application must contain an AppleScript
Dictionary. An AppleScript Dictionary details the various commands and
objects of an application that you can access via AppleScript.
The Script Editor application allows you to peer inside an application and
view its AppleScript Dictionary. To open an application’s Dictionary, choose
File➪Open Dictionary. Mac OS X searches through your installed applications
and presents you with the Open Dictionary dialog, as shown in Figure 2-4,
which lists all applications that have a dictionary and are therefore scriptable.
If you don’t see your favorite application in the list, alas, it’s probably not
scriptable. To make certain, click the Browse button and select the applica-
tion in question.
After you select an application, the Script Editor displays that application’s
AppleScript Dictionary. An application’s dictionary lists all the features of
that application that are scriptable.
Figure 2-4:
Viewing the
AppleScript
Dictionary

One Step Beyond: AppleScript Programming
644
Scriptable features are divided into categories, called Suites, which you can
see on the left side of the AppleScript Dictionary. Every Mac application is
supposed to support the Standard Suite, which lists common terms that
most applications should support.
Click an item in the Suite on the left side of the Dictionary to view detailed
information about its capabilities, as shown in Figure 2-5.
By surveying the various Suites of an application, you begin to see what
tasks you can automate. The Finder, with its huge AppleScript Dictionary, is
perhaps the most scriptable of all applications.
Anatomy of a simple script
Although a full discussion of AppleScript programming is beyond the scope
of this book — after all, we have other things to talk about, too — that doesn’t
mean that you can’t produce some quick and useful scripts. Most Apple-
Scripts begin with a command that addresses the application that you want
to automate. Enter this command into a new AppleScript document, which
you create by pressing Ô+N.
tell application “Finder”
This is like saying, “Hey, Finder, listen up! I’m going to send commands your
way!” The double quotes surround the application name that you’re address-
ing in the command.

Similarly, after you finish instructing the Finder what tasks you want per-
formed, you must also tell it to stop listening. As such, typical scripts end
with
end tell
With the shell of a script in place, all you have to do is add commands in
between the tell and end tell commands of the script. If you want your
script to force an application to the foreground, an activate command is
usually the first line within the shell of your script.
tell application “Finder”
activate
end tell
Believe it or not, this is technically a complete and valid script! It doesn’t do
much, though, so add some more functionality to make it accomplish some-
thing worthwhile. For example, suppose you want to perform some house-
keeping chores each time you log in to your Macintosh. Some desirable tasks
might include
✦Emptying the Trash
✦Having your Mac say, “Hello!” to you
(Okay, I’ll grant that hearing your Mac say, “Hello!” isn’t a housekeeping
chore, but it makes the whole script that much more fun — and really
impresses your visitors, too. No one ever said programming had to be
boring!)
To add these functions, you can do so by using a language you already know:
English. As I mention earlier, Apple tries (and sometimes succeeds) to make
AppleScript as English-like as possible. That way, you don’t have to know
some silly computer language; just use your native tongue. For example, to
empty the Trash, tell the Finder to do so.
empty trash
The trickiest line of code might be the speech, and that’s only because you
need to remember to add quotes. AppleScript thinks that anything without
quotes is an AppleScript command.
say “Hello!”
The result is a super-simple script that anyone can read but that performs
two powerful functions. The completed script looks like this:

646
tell app “Finder”
activate
empty trash
say “Hello!”
end tell
After you complete the script, choose File➪Save to save your script. Because
you want the script to execute and then quit, use the File Format field to
save it as an application. Also, make sure that the Stay Open check box and
the Startup Screen check box is disabled. And don’t forget to name your
script in the Save As text field.
To have the script automatically run each time you log in to your Mac, save
the script anywhere that you wish. (Assign its location in the Where field of
the Save window.) Open System Preferences by clicking its icon on the Dock
and then click the Accounts icon. Make sure that your account is selected
and then click Login Items. Click the Add button (which proudly bears a plus
sign) and navigate to your script in the Open dialog that appears. After you
click the Add button of the Open dialog, you see the script in the Login Items
window.
I Summon Automator — the Silicon Programmer!
Okay, perhaps I’ve watched too much Iron Chef over the years. Anyway,
Leopard features Automator (as shown in Figure 2-6) — he’s your own per-
sonal robotic AppleScript coder. In fact, Automator can create custom appli-
cations that can handle your repetitive tasks. You can even create workflows,
which are sequential (and repeatable) operations that are performed on the
same files or data, and your Automator application can automatically launch
whatever applications are necessary to get the job done.
Here’s a great example: You work with a service bureau that sends you a CD
every week with new product shots for your company’s Marketing depart-
ment. Unfortunately, these images are flat-out huge — taken with a 12-
megapixel camera — and they’re always in the wrong orientation. Before you
move them to the Marketing folder on your server, you have to laboriously
resize each image and rotate it, and then save the smaller version.
With Automator’s help, you can build a custom application that automati-
cally reads each image in the folder, resizes it, rotates it, and even generates
a thumbnail image or prints the image, and then moves the massaged images
to the proper folder. You’d normally have to manually launch Preview to per-
form the image operations and then use a Finder window to move the new
files to the right location. But now, with Automator, a single double-click of
your custom application icon does the trick.

You’ll find Automator in your Applications folder. Currently, Automator can
handle specific tasks within about 30 or 40 applications (including the
Finder), but both Apple and third-party developers are busy adding new
Automator task support to all sorts of new and existing applications.
To create a simple application using Automator, follow these steps:
1. Select Custom and click Choose.
2. Click the desired application in the Library list.
Automator displays the actions available within that application.
3. Drag the desired action from the Library window to the workflow
window.
4. Modify any specific settings provided for the action you chose.
5. Repeat Steps 1–3 to complete the workflow.
6. Click Run (upper right) to test your script.
Use sample files while you’re fine-tuning your application lest you acci-
dentally do something deleterious to an original (and irreplaceable) file!

them to the Pictures folder.

AppleScript on the Web
In addition to the built-in AppleScript help in the Finder, the Internet has
much to offer in the way of AppleScript training and examples. Like so many
other excellent Web resources, AppleScripts are free!
Not all AppleScripts are created equal: When downloading scripts from the
Internet, make sure that they’re compatible with Leopard (Mac OS X v. 10.5).
Although the majority of scripts made for Mac OS 9 also work with Mac OS X,
some simply won’t. The converse is also true: Sometimes a script is meant
solely for use with Mac OS X.

The first place on the Web that you should visit for AppleScript help is the
Source of All That Is Good, also called the Mother Ship: Apple Computer.
Although the built-in OS X help offers a lot, the Apple Web site offers even
more scripts, tutorials, and general AppleScript goodness. You can even find
a list of all known scriptable applications, which can save you from search-
ing for them with Script Editor. Furthermore, the site maintains an extensive
list of links to other useful AppleScript sites.

f you’re a hunt-and-peck typist — leaving you certain that there must 
be some better way to get information into your computer — you’ll be
happy to know that Apple has you in mind. Since the very first Mac rolled
off the assembly line, Apple has had a keen interest in alternative modes of
interaction between human and machine. Mac OS X continues in this tradi-
tion of alternative computer controls, offering two options for controlling
Mac OS X without the keyboard: handwriting and speech.
✦Handwriting: By using a pen and computer tablet, you can enter text
into your Mac by simply writing as you would on a sheet of paper.
✦Speech: Talk to your Mac to make it listen and obey your commands. It
even talks back!
This chapter guides you through the various options that you have for con-
trolling your Macintosh without using the keyboard. First, I cover the Mac
OS X Ink feature, which you use to write on a tablet to enter data into your
computer. (Although it sounds a bit ironic, think of Ink as your “digital
paper” for the new millennium.) Whatever you write on the tablet appears
on the screen as text.
I also take a look at the more space-age speech capabilities available to you
in Mac OS X. With your voice, you can command a Macintosh to perform all
sorts of interesting feats. And just so you don’t get lonely, the Mac even
talks back to you. (Now you can control your computer just like Spock from
Star Trek!) And Leopard’s VoiceOver feature makes it easy for your Mac to
read aloud all sorts of text, including Web pages, Mail messages, and word
processing documents.

Using Ink with a Tablet
652
So, scoot away from your computer, lean that chair back, and let your Mac
take care of the rest.
Using Ink with a Tablet
Typing on a keyboard can be a tedious and error-prone experience for even
the best typists. To help out, Apple added some useful handwriting features
to Mac OS X. Based in part on some of Apple’s handheld software for the
Newton (one of the first personal digital assistants [PDAs], and a product
released before its time), the handwriting recognition in Mac OS X gives 
you the ability to write text on a compatible tablet for use in your favorite
applications.
The basic process of working with handwriting on Mac OS X goes like this:
1. Attach a tablet to your Mac.
Most tablets use a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, so connecting
one to your computer is as simple as plugging in the cable from your
tablet to the USB port on your Mac.
2. Write on the tablet with the stylus that accompanies it.
A stylus is the name given the fake “pen” that accompanies most tablets.
A stylus doesn’t have any ink in it: It’s just a pen-shaped tool with a plas-
tic tip meant for writing on a tablet.
3. Your Mac interprets your handwriting.
After your Mac recognizes the handwriting, it sends that text to the fore-
most application at the cursor location where you would normally type
with the keyboard. You’re spared the whole training bit, too.
You aren’t restricted to writing just text on the tablet, naturally. You can use
it to control the interface of your Mac as you would a mouse. A tablet also
works great for graphics applications, like procreate Painter and Adobe
Photoshop. Many artists are frustrated when drawing with a mouse; but
when you use a tablet, you can feel right at home with the natural pen or
brush movements that you’ve always used.
Although Leopard takes care of handwriting recognition, it does offer you a
few settings in the Ink panel within System Preferences. To view the System
Preferences, click the System Preferences icon on the Dock. From there, click
the Ink icon to adjust settings for your tablet.
If you don’t have a tablet connected to your Macintosh, you can’t view the
System Preferences pane for Ink. Mac OS X is smart enough to show you
only the settings for your current hardware setup.

Computer, Can You Hear Me?
Remember that classic scene from the movie Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home
where Scotty picks up the mouse on a Macintosh and tries to talk directly to
the computer? Since the very early days of the Mac OS, Apple has included
some form of speech recognition in their computers. Leopard continues to
improve on speech recognition by offering a host of tools that let you get
more work done in a shorter amount of time. (We’re not to that point yet,
Scotty, but we’re working on it.)
The Speech Recognition features of Mac OS X let you speak a word, phrase,
or sentence. After you’ve spoken, your Mac goes to work translating what
you said — and if it understands the phrase, it then performs an action asso-
ciated with that phrase. The great part about this system is that you can say
any phrase in continuous speech and have your Mac perform any sort of
action that you can imagine. In fact, you aren’t limited to just one action: You
could perform dozens of actions upon speaking a particular phrase.
Before you get started using Speech Recognition, you need a microphone to
get sound into your Mac. Virtually all current Macintosh models have a built-
in microphone; for example, if you use an Intel iMac, your microphone is
built into the monitor. MacBooks have a similar microphone built into the
screen. If your Mac doesn’t have a microphone, connect one to the rear of
your Macintosh by plugging it into the microphone jack.
If you’re looking for the best quality audio input from your microphone for
use with iChat, check out a microphone with a USB connection. You’ll get far
better sound quality than a microphone that connects to your analog jack.
The Speech Recognition tab
To get started with Speech Recognition in Mac OS X, open the System
Preferences window by clicking its icon on the Dock and then clicking the
Speech icon. This brings up the Speech panel, as shown in Figure 3-1.
You’ll find that two tabs comprise the speech settings of Mac OS X:
✦Speech Recognition
✦Text to Speech
In this section, I’m concerned only with the Speech Recognition tab. Later, in
the section, “Your Mac Talks Back!,” I explore the Text to Speech tab.

Computer, Can You Hear Me?
654
The Speech Recognition tab consists of two sub-tabs:
✦Settings: The Settings tab provides a number of settings that control
how your Mac listens to Its Master’s Voice. (Meaning you, friend reader.)
From here, you can set the sound input, adjust the key on the keyboard
that toggles speech recognition on and off, change microphone settings,
and name your computer with a keyword. (You do want to call your com-
puter by name like any techno-wizard, don’t you?)
✦Commands: When Speech Recognition is active, your Mac can under-
stand any number of commands. From the Commands tab, you tell the
Mac what type of command it should expect you to give. You can also
specify whether you’ll be giving the commands word-for-word or whether
your Mac should be prepared to interpret paraphrasing. A number of
specific applications and menus can be configured with speakable items,
like contact names within Leopard’s Address Book.
Crowning the Speech Recognition panel are the Speakable Items On and Off
radio buttons. You’ve probably already guessed how to use ’em to switch
Speech Recognition features on and off.
When you select the On radio button, the small circular Speech Recognition
Feedback window appears on your screen, floating above all other windows.
Know this face well because the Feedback window (also shown in Figure 3-1)
is your friend and partner. If you use Speech Recognition often, it’ll become a
constant companion on your Desktop. (More on it in the next section.)

The Settings panel
At the bottom of the Settings panel is the Upon Recognition section. When
your Mac comprehends one of your stentorian commands, you can set it to
respond by playing a sound, speaking a confirmation, or both. This is helpful
when you’re not sure whether your Mac understands you. One hundred per-
cent recognition isn’t a reality on any computer at this point, so sometimes
it helps to have any feedback that you can get. Otherwise, you might feel
silly shouting at your machine while it sits there doing nothing. (Or perhaps
not, if you’re into really inexpensive anger management.)
You can choose between two styles of listening with the Listening Method
options:
✦Listen Only While Key Is Pressed: Speech Recognition works only while
the designated key is held down.
✦Listen Continuously with Keyword: When you speak the keyword, lis-
tening turns on and remains on.
To change what key must be toggled or held down, click the Change Key
button.
Why change the keyword? Instead of saying, “Computer, empty the Trash!”
you might prefer, “Elrond, empty the Trash!” This adds a little bit of person-
ality to the interaction and also gives your computer a slightly longer time to
react to your command. (As a general rule, the longer the spoken phrase, the
more likely your Mac will understand it.) If you select the Listen Continuously
with Keyword feature, you can change your computer’s name via the Keyword
text box.
Finally, you can select the microphone that you want to use from the Micro-
phone pop-up menu on the Settings panel — a great feature if you have more
than one microphone connected to your Mac. Click the Calibrate key to
adjust the sound volume for better recognition.
The Commands panel
When Speech Recognition is active, your Mac listens for whatever phrases
appear in your Speakable Items folder (a directory on your hard drive that
holds a number of scripts). The Commands tab (as shown in Figure 3-2)
allows you to view the contents of this folder. When you speak a phrase that
matches one of these filenames, your Mac automatically executes that
script. The script can perform any number of actions, which is what makes
Speech Recognition so powerful. Apple includes a large number of scripts
with Mac OS X, but you’re free to create your own, too.

Computer, Can You Hear Me?
656
To make something speakable, select the item and then speak the command,
“Make this speakable.” The new speakable command is based upon the
item’s name.
To view the contents of the Speakable Items folder, click the Open Speakable
Items Folder button on the Commands panel. The Finder comes to the fore-
ground and navigates to the folder that holds the scripts. This is handy
because each item in the Speakable Items folder is speakable.
To the right of the Open Speakable Items Folder button is another button:
Helpful Tips. Click it to get some pointers on how to get the best perform-
ance from your microphone.
As I mention in the preceding section, the Speech Recognition features of
Mac OS X aren’t restricted to items in the Speakable Items folder. Any appli-
cation that supports Speech Recognition is also fair game for your verbal
manipulation. To control commands within other applications, use the
Commands tab (refer to Figure 3-2). Here you can enable the following check
boxes:
✦Address Book
✦Global Speakable Items
✦Application Specific Items
✦Application Switching

✦Front Window (requires that you activate assistive devices in the
Universal Access panel within System Preferences)
✦Menu Bar (requires that you activate assistive devices in the Universal
Access panel within System Preferences)
Mark any one of these options to allow your Mac to listen to those kinds of
commands.
The Feedback window
After you activate Speech Recognition, you instantly see the Feedback
window. You can click and drag the edge of the window to position it any-
where on your Desktop.
The Feedback window includes controls and displays of its own:
✦Microphone Level Meter: The Feedback window displays indicators to
let you know how loud the input to your microphone is.
✦Visual Indicator: The Feedback window displays visual feedback to let
you know what mode it is in: idle, listening, or hearing a command.
When the microphone isn’t grayed out but there are no arrows on either
side of the microphone, you’re in listening mode. When the microphone
is flanked by animated arrows, your computer is hearing a command
spoken. When Speech Recognition is idle, no arrows are present, and the
microphone is grayed out.
✦Quick-Access Menu: You can quickly access the Speech preferences 
for the System or view the Speech Commands window. Just click the
downward-pointing arrow at the bottom of the Feedback window, and a
menu appears giving you one-click access to both.
As soon as you disable speech recognition in the System Preferences, the
Feedback window disappears.
The Speech Command window
Because Speech Recognition might be listening for different sets of com-
mands from the Finder or many other applications, Mac OS X provides you
with a single listing of all commands that you might speak at any given time:
the Speech Commands window. To open the Speech Commands window,
click the triangle at the bottom of the Feedback window and choose Open
Speech Commands Window from the menu that appears.
The Speech Commands window is a simple one, but it serves an important
purpose: to let you know what commands Mac OS X understands. The

Your Mac Talks Back!
658
Speech Commands pane, as shown in Figure 3-3, organizes commands into
categories that match the settings in the Speech pane of the System
Preferences.
If you launch another application that supports Speech Recognition, Mac OS
X adds that application’s commands to the Speech Commands window.
Speak any of these commands to make your Mac execute that function. For
example, Mac OS X ships with speech commands for Address Book, such as
Mail To and Video Chat With.
Apple might be a big, serious, computer company — yeah, right — but it
isn’t without a humorous side! With Speech Recognition enabled, say the
phrase, “Tell me a joke.” Your Mac replies with a random joke. Say it again,
and your Mac tells you another joke. (Brace yourself, these jokes were likely
written by Windows users . . . they’re really, really bad.) Oh, and if you get a
“Knock, Knock” joke, remember that you have to actually say, “Who’s there?”
Your Mac Talks Back!
Mac OS X is great at listening to your speech, but the fun doesn’t stop 
there . . . your Mac can talk to you, too! By using one of the many available
voices — including the latest Leopard addition, Alex — you can make your
computer talk or even sing. (Not as well as Sinatra, but better than Bob

Dylan.) And although Speech Recognition lets you speak to your Macintosh,
the VoiceOver feature gives your Mac the ability to speak text. This is an
especially useful feature because it lets you listen to your e-mails, Web
pages, or even your homework — sometimes the eyes need a break. Text-to-
speech gives you the opportunity to lean back in your chair or even get up
and walk around while still using your Macintosh.
Text-to-speech settings appear in three places within System Preferences:
our old friend, the Speech pane; the Date & Time pane; and the VoiceOver
settings within the Universal Access pane.
The Text to Speech panel
The text-to-speech engine that comes with Leopard has a collection of many
different voices from which to choose; some voices are male, some are female,
and some aren’t human at all. To select your Mac’s voice in Mac OS X, follow
these steps:
1. Click the System Preferences icon on the Dock.
2. Click the Speech icon.
3. Click the Text to Speech tab, as shown in Figure 3-4.
Click the System Voice pop-up menu to choose a voice for your Mac. To hear
the voice, click Play; Leopard speaks a sentence as a demonstration. To the
Figure 3-4:

panel.

left of the Play button is a slider for adjusting the speed of the speech. Move
the slider to the right to increase the speed at which your Mac speaks and to
the left to slow it down.
Naturally, Alex receives the most attention these days, because he debuts
with Leopard . . . and Alex definitely provides the most natural sounding
tone and best pacing of the bunch. However, I also think that the old school
voices, like Bruce and Vicki, are still quite intelligible. (I’m a Vicki kinda guy
myself.)
Talking alerts
After you select a voice, you have a variety of ways to make your Macintosh
speak automatically to you, based on some simple rules. For example, every
Mac owner has run into an Alert dialog. (Alert dialogs are typically accompa-
nied by a select group of words — better left unspoken — from the human
behind the keyboard.) An Alert dialog usually displays some kind of icon
from the following list:
✦Stop sign: Indicates that something particularly important requires your
attention — usually an error or a dire warning.
✦Yield sign: Signals that you should proceed cautiously; not as severe as
the Stop sign, but important nonetheless.
✦Notification: Looks like the profile of a person speaking; displays an
informative message, but not a warning. You could use this feature, for
example, to have a calendar application alert you when you have a meet-
ing or a deadline.
From the Text to Speech panel, you can choose to have your Mac speak a
specific phrase or the contents of the Alert dialog by selecting one of the
check boxes at the middle of the panel. If you enable the Announce When
Alerts Are Displayed check box, click the Set Alert Options button to set
alert-specific options:
✦Voice: Choose the voice that should speak alerts. (By default, it’s the
voice you choose earlier.)
✦Phrase: Click this pop-up menu to choose a “prefix” phrase that’s
spoken before the actual alert text. By default, Leopard speaks the name
of the application that displayed the alert, but you can also choose a
phrase from the list or choose to mix up the phrases for a little variety.
To add or remove phrases, click the Edit Phrases item.
✦Delay: Drag this slider to control the increment of time that Leopard
allows to pass before it speaks.

Book VII
Chapter 3
Talking and Writing
to Your Macintosh
Your Mac Talks Back!
661
To hear what your spoken alert settings sound like in use, click the Play
button.
If you click the Play button on the Set Alert Options sheet and don’t hear
anything right away, remember that it doesn’t begin speaking until the time
has elapsed that you set with the Delay slider. To hear the spoken alerts
speak as soon as you click the Play button, move the slider to 0 (zero).
Other spoken items
In addition to spoken alerts, you can allow your Mac to speak when other
actions occur. Again, these settings are found on the Text to Speech panel.
Your Mac can speak in the following circumstances:
✦Announce when an application requires your attention: In case you
have your Dock hidden from view, it’s not always clear when an applica-
tion needs your attention. In these instances, Mac OS X grabs your atten-
tion via speech.
✦Read a selection of text when you press a particular key: If you have a
child who’s learning to read, the Mac can help them by reading a selec-
tion of text. Kids can figure out how to drag and select text often more
quickly than they can read that text.
✦Announce the time: Are you like me, constantly getting lost in time
while immersed in your work? (Not to mention your favorite game.) I’ve
set my MacBook Pro to announce the hour, which always keeps my time
sense firmly planted.
The Date & Time panel
There you are, deep in concentration as you finish up the final chapter of
your Great American Novel, when you glance at the clock in the Finder menu
bar and realize that you were supposed to pick up your kids at soccer prac-
tice a full hour ago!
You can avoid this shameful lapse of parental responsibility by turning on
Leopard’s automatic spoken time feature, which is controlled from the Date
& Time pane within System Preferences (and is much more effective than a
mechanical cuckoo clock). But why go to all the trouble of clicking Show All
when you can just click the Open Date & Time Preferences button on the
Text to Speech panel? Leopard immediately switches to display the Date &
Time panel. You can even click the Clock on the Finder menu bar and click
Open Date & Time. (Again, it’s all about the convenience when it comes to
the geniuses at Apple.)

Your Mac Talks Back!
662
Mark the Announce the Time check box to enable your Mac to speak the
time; then use the Period pop-up menu to choose spoken time at the quarter,
half, or full hour. You can also customize the voice for spoken time as well.
After you’re done, zip back to the Speech pane by clicking the Back button at
the top-left corner of the System Preferences window.
Configuring VoiceOver within 
the Universal Access panel
With Leopard’s VoiceOver utility, your Mac can provide you with all sorts of
verbal feedback, creating a spoken English interface with Leopard — a valu-
able addition to the operating system for the physically impaired. The feed-
back includes
✦Announcing when certain keys are pressed: Leopard can tell you when
a modifier key (like Control, Option, or Command) is pressed or when
the Caps Lock key is pressed.
✦Announcing cursor movements: You hear an audible alert when your
mouse cursor switches between windows or when you’ve clicked on a
menu.
✦Announcing the position of the VoiceOver cursor: VoiceOver can audi-
bly identify all operating system controls (like buttons, sliders, and list
boxes) by using a special onscreen cursor.
✦Reading documents, Web pages, and Mail messages: VoiceOver can read
aloud the contents of all sorts of documents and application windows.
✦Speaking the characters you type: You can set VoiceOver to speak
every character or each word you type.
Here is how to enable VoiceOver (or to launch the VoiceOver utility, as
shown in Figure 3-5):

1. Click the Open Universal Access Preferences button on the Text to
Speech panel.
2. Select the On radio button (or press Ô+F5) to enable VoiceOver. (If
you’re using a MacBook or MacBook Pro, press Ô+Fn+F5 instead.)
To customize how VoiceOver operates, click the Open VoiceOver Utility
button.
Speaking text through applications
Although VoiceOver provides a comprehensive text-to-speech interface for
Mac OS X, it might be more than you need. If you simply want to hear text
spoken within your applications, a number of alternative methods are
included in Leopard that doesn’t require VoiceOver.
One of the simplest ways to hear spoken text in Mac OS X is by using the
TextEdit application. TextEdit is a simple text processor that accompanies
every copy of Mac OS X. Besides its handy word processing features,
TextEdit can also speak text. This is good for reviewing a document after
you’ve written it by listening to it. To hear spoken text with TextEdit, follow
these steps:
1. Launch TextEdit from the Applications folder.
To open the Applications folder, choose Go➪Applications from the Finder.
In the window that appears, double-click the TextEdit application.
This launches the TextEdit application and opens a new document.
2. Enter some text.
Either type some text on the keyboard or paste some into the document
from the Clipboard. Here’s an example:
Billy Gates has lots of cash
Lots of cash
Lots of cash
Billy Gates has lots of cash
I’d like $10 please!
3. Choose Edit➪Speech➪Start Speaking.
Your Mac begins speaking the text from the document. The speech
engine has some intelligence, so you can enter dollar amounts (such as
$25,423.12) or Roman numerals (such as Chapter XIV), and the speech
engine reads them back in plain English. The result of these two strings
would be “twenty-five thousand, four-hundred twenty-three dollars, and
twelve cents” and “chapter fourteen.”
4. Choose Edit➪Speech➪Stop Speaking.

Your Mac Talks Back!
664
You Mac stops speaking. It also stops speaking when it reaches the end
of the text.
Speaking text through services
You can also speak text within most applications by using the Services
menu, located under the application’s named menu. To speak text from an
application, first select that text. Then, choose Application➪Services➪
Speech➪Start Speaking to speak text from many applications (where
Application is the name of the currently running application). If you don’t
want to use VoiceOver, this works great for doing things like
✦Speaking a Web page aloud
✦Reading your e-mail
✦Listening to a speech you’ve written in Pages
As you might expect, choosing Application➪Services➪Speech➪Stop
Speaking ceases the banter emanating from your Mac’s speaker.
Alas, not all applications are created equal. Some applications can’t access
the Services offered in the Services menu — if you don’t see Speech in the
list of services, you’re out of luck.

n a little more than a decade, surfing the Internet has gone from a nerd’s
hobby to a fun activity enjoyed by the whole family. For children and
grandparents alike, Web surfing has become one of the world’s most popu-
lar spectator sports — and at some point, you’ll probably get the itch to
become more involved. Everyone else has a Web site, so why not you?
Creating and hosting your own Web site can be a rewarding experience, and
with some help from Apple and Mac OS X, it’s a cinch to do. I devote Book
III, Chapter 7 to iWeb, the Web page creation application that’s part of iLife,
but that’s not the only way to get your message on the Web! Whether you
want to share your favorite eggplant recipes, display pictures of your auber-
gine Auburn, or just post a purple résumé, Mac OS X has you covered in
more ways than one.
So put on your seat belts — you’re now entering a strange world of servers,
mysterious codes, and things that go bump in the Net. No need for alarm,
though . . . Apple has made the topic so simple that even a politician can 
do it.
Building a Site with .Mac
To get you up and running on the Web quickly, Apple offers a suite of online
Web-publishing tools. The toolbox, collectively known as .Mac, gives you
easy and fast access to a variety of Internet functions, including e-mail, your
iDisk online storage, and HomePage, which allows you to build and edit your
own Web site from any computer with an Internet connection. A .Mac mem-
bership costs $99.95 per year.

Registering as a .Mac user
You can visit Apple’s home on the Internet to register as a .Mac user:
www.mac.com
To register for your free 60-day trial, you must create a username and pass-
word. The username that you select is an important part of the .Mac experi-
ence, so choose it carefully. Your username plays a part in your e-mail
address, your Web address, your login name, and even the bar code on your
forehead. (Okay, the bar code is a joke — for now, anyway — but the rest
aren’t.) Take a few minutes to carefully plan your .Mac username. Your user-
name saves you some typing, is easier for your friends to remember, and
(like a customized license plate for your car) can convey a certain personal-
ity to others on the Web.
Setting up your site with HomePage
After you successfully register as a .Mac user, log in to the Mac section of the
Apple Web site. You can find it on the toolbar at the top of the Web page.
Click the HomePage icon that appears at the left side (or top) of the page.
This takes you to the login screen (see Figure 4-1). Enter your username and
password that you enter upon registration and click the Enter button.

HomePage is a complete publishing tool for building Web pages that’s actu-
ally a Web site itself. HomePage lets you choose from a variety of styles that
you can then apply to your Web site within a matter of seconds; because it’s
template driven, even non-techies can produce impressive-looking Web sites.
After you finish designing your Web pages by selecting one of the premade
templates, HomePage automatically posts them to your .Mac Web site.
The HomePage interface includes two sections: the Pages section and the
Create a Page section. The Pages section (as shown at the top of Figure 4-2)
is where you manage the various pages of your site; here you can view a list
of all pages on your site as well as password-protect any pages on your site.
After you complete your site, you can get spiffy and formal by sending an
announcement (click the Announce Site button) to all your friends from the
Site section.
Scroll down to the Create a Page section, as shown in Figure 4-3, from which
you can directly add a page to your site based on a variety of premade Web
page templates. Apple offers a multitude of styles to suit your needs. Click
any one of these styles to add it to your Web site. When you do, .Mac walks
you through a series of questions that indicate what specific information,
graphics, or movies you want on that Web page.
✦Photo Album: Display your favorite photos and images for your friends
and family.
✦File Sharing: With HomePage, you can quickly post your favorite files

✦Writing: Want to update all those close (and not-so-close) relatives on
your family’s doings? Put out a newspaper or post an online diary.
✦Resume: Looking for a job? A Web-based résumé is a handy tool for
impressing prospective employers.
✦Baby: When your bundle of joy arrives, it’s a cinch to post photos of the
new baby to your HomePage site. This works great for long-distance rel-
atives because they can cyber-visit the hospital without leaving home. It
also works well for keeping those curious aunts and uncles out of the
delivery room.
✦Education: Schools are depending more and more on the Internet. To
help the student and the teacher, Apple provides several useful educa-
tion-related pages for you to use, including event calendars, homework
pages, and an online school newspaper.
✦Invite: The Web makes for a great tool when it comes to delivering invi-
tations. Gone are the hassles of standing in line at the post office, licking
300 stamps, and having cards lost in the mail. Send your guests a Web-
based invitation. Your guests will thank you. The trees that you save will
thank you. Moreover, your tongue will thank you. The post office, how-

Creating a Home Page with HTML and iDisk
669
✦Advanced: Click this tab to add pages you’ve created with an external
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) editor. (Read more about these
editors in the upcoming sections “Creating a Home Page with HTML and
iDisk” and “Serving static information.”)
Keep adding pages to your site as you see fit. Each type of page has a differ-
ent layout. If a page requires media, like images or movies, for example,
HomePage automatically lists all media available on your iDisk. You simply
select the desired media file, and HomePage adds them to the current page.
The following section elaborates more on iDisk.
After you complete your Web site, you access it by using a URL like this
(with your_username replaced with your actual username):
http://homepage.mac.com/your_username
Adding files with iDisk
If you create a Web page with HomePage that requires images or movies, add
them to your site by using iDisk. iDisk is a space on the Apple servers desig-
nated just for you, where HomePage stores the elements of your site when
you add or change Web pages.
You aren’t limited to iDisk access via HomePage: Simply choose the iDisk menu
from the Finder’s Go menu to mount your iDisk. (No need for a saddle — I
explain more about mounting volumes in Book I.) When you mount an iDisk,
it shows up as an icon on your Desktop, just like you might see when you
insert a CD into your Mac. The icon for your iDisk, however, looks like a hard
drive with a blue globe on top of it.
With your iDisk mounted, double-click its icon to view its contents. Apple
organizes iDisk with a handful of folders that correspond to the page types in
HomePage; you can’t delete or rename these folders, however. If you need an
image for your photo album page, stick it in the Pictures folder. If you need a
movie for your Web page, copy it to the Movies folder. When you return to
HomePage, your files now appear in the list of items that you can use in a
Web page.
Creating a Home Page with HTML and iDisk
For those folks who like driving a car without knowing what goes on under
the hood, HomePage is perfect: You just use it to create and post Web pages
without knowing what makes it all work. On the other hand, some folks are
born mechanics and like to get under the hood. If you’re itching to see what
goes on behind the scenes, Apple gives you a chance to get your hands dirty.

Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
670
Of course, you don’t have to use HomePage to work on your Web site. If
you’re well versed in HTML, you can edit your Web page files on your iDisk
just like you would any file on your hard drive.
Within your iDisk, open the Sites folder to see the various files that compose
your Web page. If you’re an old pro at HTML, you can add your own pages to
your iDisk with your favorite text editor. In other words, the iDisk acts much
like any other disk that you’re accustomed to using. (For all the inside infor-
mation on iDisk, see Chapter 4 of Book IV.)
As I mention earlier, you can also click the Advanced tab in the Create a Page
section to have HomePage assist you in uploading your own pages.
Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
With .Mac, Apple takes care of the Web server for you, but you aren’t limited
to just iWeb, HomePage, and .Mac: You have other options when it comes 
to posting Web pages. Mac OS X comes stocked with its own high-powered
Web server, so you can run things without .Mac. Consider the advantages,
won’t you?
✦Privacy: Everyone in the house wants access to the family phone book.
You want all computers on your home network to see the telephone list
but not the whole world. Posting it on the home network keeps it secure
from prying eyes outside your home.
✦Your own domain: Want a name like www.size14feetphotos.com?
(Don’t even think about it, I’ve already taken it.) Anyway, if you run your
own Web server, you can arrange for your own domain name.
✦Speed: Your friend needs a copy of your iMovie masterpiece for a class
project. Rather than wait for you to post the file to your iDisk, he
decides to download it directly from your computer.
✦Coolness factor: It’s fun, easy to do, and your mother will truly be proud.
Seriously, it’s fun and easy to run your own Web server. (And although
your mother might not actually give a hoot, companies appreciate employ-
ees who know useful skills; therefore, Web server stuff is good to know.)
I love Apache: Confessions of a UNIX Webmaster
Deep in the guts of Mac OS X lies one of the most popular Web servers around:
Apache, which turns your Macintosh into a full-featured Web server. The
Apache Web server is well known around the world and comprises about
half of all personal and commercial Web servers in use today. Yes, that’s
right! You have one of the world’s most-used Web servers installed already
on your Mac!

Book VII
Chapter 4
Hosting a Web Site

Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
671
Apache’s first appealing feature is its price — absolutely free. Free is sassy!
Free isn’t any good without quality, though. Fortunately, Apache is extremely
reliable — and combined with the crash-proof Mac OS X, you can be almost
certain that your Web server is always available. Besides being rock-solid
and free, Apache sports all the features you’d expect from a top-notch Web
server, such as techno-wizard integration with databases and scripting lan-
guages. Believe me, it can serve anything you throw at it.
Configuring and running Apache
In addition to all its great qualities, Apache is dead simple to operate in Mac
OS X. Open System Preferences and click the Sharing icon; then mark the
check box next to Web Sharing to launch Apache. That’s it! It doesn’t get any
easier . . . at least, when it comes to turning on Apache. (See Figure 4-4.)
To begin using your Web server, open a Finder window and navigate to the
Sites folder that resides in your Home folder; this is the root of your per-
sonal space on the Web server. Any files that you add to this folder are
accessible via your Web server.
You might find a file named index.html installed already in the Sites folder.
This is the default file for your Web site. To view it, open your favorite Web
browser and load this URL, replacing ~username with the username that
you’re currently using:
http://127.0.0.1/~username/
Figure 4-4:
Turning on
Apache is 
a cinch.

Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
672
The 127.0.0.1 address is a generic Internet Protocol (IP) address, which
means self. (In other words, your Mac is connecting to itself. Faintly unset-
tling, but absolutely legal.) You can also use your real IP address, which
appears at the bottom of the Sharing panel in the System Preferences when
you turn on Web Sharing.
To see the Web page from another computer, you must use the real IP
address. The 127.0.0.1 address is merely a convenience for use when you’re
using the actual machine that runs the Web server.
Because Mac OS X is a multi-user environment, each user can host a Web
site. The key is the username found at the end of the URL; replace it with the
appropriate username, and you’re ready to go. If everything goes smoothly,
you should be viewing the default Mac OS X Web page, as shown in Figure 4-5.
The default page displays a welcome message and some important informa-
tion for Web-sharing beginners. Make sure that you read the information
carefully.
In addition to a main page for any individual that logs in, the Web server also
has a global default page. To find the global default page, follow these steps:
1. Open a new Finder window.
2. Double-click the drive that contains your Mac OS X installation.
3. Choose Library➪WebServer➪Documents.

Here you find dozens of HTML files. These files are the default global home
pages for many different languages. For English versions of the Mac OS, this
means that the file named index.html.en serves as the default home page
for the server. To view this file in your browser, try this URL:
http://127.0.0.1/
Serving static information
To change the default Web page, simply open it in iWeb . . . or use your
favorite HTML editor and start editing. An HTML editor is an application that
lets you lay out your Web page with what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG)
ease. If you’re familiar with a word processor, you’re well on your way to
using an HTML editor. Of the many HTML editors available, VersionTracker
(www.versiontracker.com) gives you a good head start on finding some
of the most popular ones.
You aren’t limited only to HTML editors, of course. Many word processors
support HTML export — I particularly like Microsoft Word — so it’s trés easy
to create Web pages with them by simply choosing File➪Save As.
If you already know HTML (Webmasters might say, “If you can bang out raw
HTML code”), you can edit your Web pages by hand. Open the existing
index.html file with a text editor, like TextEdit or BBEdit (www.bare
bones.com), by choosing File➪Open and change it to suit your needs. For
example, a simple Web page might read like this:
<html>
<head><title>My First Web Page</title></head>
<body>
Welcome to my Web site!
</body>
</html>
Plain-old HTML pages are handy for displaying the same information repeat-
edly. Computer Web-wizards call this type of information static. (That is, it
doesn’t change. Like a fully grown Chia Pet, you can set it once and forget
about it.)
Serving information dynamically
Although static displays are good for things like your copy of the Magna
Carta or sports stats from the past 20 years, they’re not so great for data
that changes a lot (usually referred to as dynamic, if you hadn’t guessed
already). Some good examples of dynamic information are the date, the time,
your age, or the weather. If you were to display your age on a Web page by

Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
674
using only HTML, you’d have to change it only once every year. This isn’t so
bad, but consider what happens if you want to post the date on a Web page:
Now you have to update the Web page once per day. Add the time, and now
you’re down to HTML changes every hour, minute, or second, depending on
how reliable you want to make the clock. Clearly, you need something
besides static HTML for dynamic information.
The Apache Web server allows you to use a variety of tools to produce
dynamic Web pages. The most basic tool for serving dynamic data is the
Server Side Include. The Web server executes a small piece of code in your
HTML; then the Web server replaces that code with some text and sends the
page to whoever requested it. The result is dynamic text in your Web page.
Adding Server Side Includes requires that you perform a few preparatory
steps beforehand. To alter Apache settings, you must change text in its set-
tings file. The file is named httpd.conf and is located here:
/etc/apache2/httpd.conf 
You probably can’t find this file if you go searching for it in the Finder
because it’s a hidden file. Some text editors, like BBEdit, can open hidden
files, but you might not have that on hand. You do have the Terminal applica-
tion, though. Launch the Terminal by double-clicking its icon. (You can find
it in the Utility folder that resides in your Applications folder.) Book VII,
Chapter 1 has more information about the Terminal in case you need a
refresher. At the prompt that appears, enter this command:
sudo pico /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
You are then nudged to provide a password at the following prompt:
Password:
When prompted for a password, use an administrator account password on
your machine. If you’re the only user, this might be the password of the user
that you’re currently signed in as. Press Return and you’re looking at the
innards of the Apache setup file. There’s a lot of what I call Programmer Pig
Latin in this file, but don’t be discouraged. Scroll down through the file (use
the arcane UNIX Control+V key sequence) and look for this chunk of text:
# Note that “MultiViews” must be named *explicitly* --- “Options All”
# doesn’t give it to you.
# 
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews 
If you don’t feel like scrolling through a bunch of text, you can jump to the
text by pressing Control+W (shorthand for where), entering the text that you

Book VII
Chapter 4
Hosting a Web Site
with Mac OS X
Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
675
want to find (for example: Options Indexes FollowSymLinks), and then
pressing Return.
Whenever you find the desired text in the file, add the word Includes to the
end of the last line of this text.
# Note that “MultiViews” must be named *explicitly* --- “Options All”
# doesn’t give it to you.
# 
Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews Includes
Notice the many pound (#) characters. A pound character denotes a com-
ment: Think of comments as notes to yourself that help you remember what
the heck you were doing at this point in the file. Techno-wizard coders would
say it this way: When a comment character (#) precedes a line, that line of
text performs no function. You can use this to your advantage to turn set-
tings on and off for the server. Add a pound character to the beginning of a
line, and that function stops working. Remove the character, and the func-
tion works again. Continue scrolling through the httpd.conf file by using
the arrow keys or the Control+W search trick, looking for the following:
# To use server-parsed HTML files
#
AddType text/html .shtml
AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
Make sure that no # characters precede the AddType and AddHandler
lines. After you finish, press Control+O, press Return to save the file, and
then press Control+X to exit the pico text editor. After you finish editing
Apache’s settings, you have to restart it for the changes to take effect. Open
the System Preferences and click the Internet tab. Deactivate Web Sharing
and then reactivate it again.
Open your favorite text editor and add some text to a new file:
<html>
<head><title>My First Web Page</title></head>
<body>
Welcome to my Web site!<br>
Today’s date: <!--#echo var=”DATE_LOCAL” -->
</body>
</html>
The <!--#echo var=”DATE_LOCAL” --> part is a Server Side Include. The
server understands the “DATE_LOCAL” message, and in its place, adds text
that displays today’s date. Save the text file and give it the name index.
shtml.

Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
676
Make sure that you include the .shtml extension. It’s important for making
the Server Side Includes work properly.
Save the file in your global Web folder, located here:
/Library/WebServer/documents/index.shtml
Finally, it’s time to check out your handiwork and rest your fingers from all
this typing. Open a Web browser and navigate to the URL of your global Web
folder:
http://127.0.0.1/index.shtml
The result should be a Web page that displays today’s date. (I know, it’s not
particularly material for the Louvre at this point, but I think you can appreci-
ate the possibilities.)
If you’re not content with appending .shtml to your files to take advantage
of Server Side Includes, you need to perform another step. When you view
your Web site with a Web browser, it’s customary to use default pages for a
particular directory. For example, when loading the following URL
http://127.0.0.1/
the server looks for a default page to load on the server because you didn’t
specify one. This is normally a file named index.html, which causes prob-
lems for Server Side Includes because they require a filename ending with
.shtml. The easiest way to fix this is to tell the server that index.shtml
can also be a default page. To fix this discrepancy, reload the Apache config-
uration file by using this command line:
sudo pico /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
If you perform this step within 15 minutes of your last sudo command, you
don’t have to re-enter a password. If it’s been longer, you might have to enter
the password — I tell you in Chapter 1 of this mini-book that UNIX has
sophisticated security. Then scroll down through the httpd.conf file and
find this bit of text:
# DirectoryIndex: Name of the file or files to use as a pre-written HTML
# directory index.  Separate multiple entries with spaces.
#    
<IfModule mod_dir.c>
DirectoryIndex index.html
</IfModule>

Book VII
Chapter 4
Hosting a Web Site
with Mac OS X
Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
677
Change it by adding index.shtml to it:
# DirectoryIndex: Name of the file or files to use as a pre-written HTML
# directory index.  Separate multiple entries with spaces.
#    
<IfModule mod_dir.c>
DirectoryIndex index.shtml index.html
</IfModule>
Notice that index.shtml precedes index.html. This line indicates which
filenames you can use for the default filename of any folder on the Web
server. In this case, I’m forcing index.shtml as the default filename before
index.html. This means that when you load a Web page from your server
without specifying a specific file, Apache looks for a file named index.
shtml in that folder first. If it can’t find one, it looks for a file named index.
html. With that change in place, press Control+O to write the file to disk and
then press Control+X to quit the pico text editor. To see your work in action,
stop and restart Personal Web Sharing on the Sharing pane in System
Preferences; then load this URL with your Web browser:
http://127.0.0.1/
The result should be that your index.shtml page loads with Server Side
Includes intact.
Server Side Includes can perform a few other simple functions besides the
date, including
✦DATE_GMT: Today’s date in Greenwich Mean Time
✦DATE_LOCAL: Today’s date in your local time zone (You’re already an
expert with this one.)
✦DOCUMENT_NAME: The name of document
✦LAST_MODIFIED: The date when this document was last modified
To see them all in action, alter your index.shtml file to read like this:
<html>
<head><title>My First Web Page</title></head>
<body>
Welcome to my Web site! <br><br>
GMT date: <!--#echo var=”DATE_GMT” --> <br>
Today’s date: <!--#echo var=”DATE_LOCAL” --><br>
Name of this document: <!--#echo var=”DOCUMENT_NAME” --><br>
Last Modified: <!--#echo var=”LAST_MODIFIED” --><br>
</body>
</html>
Reload your Web server’s main page to see the results.

Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
678
Fancier dynamic stuff
Another common use of Server Side Includes gives you a chance to remove
whole chunks of your HTML files and put them into another file. (Sounds
messy, doesn’t it?) You might want to do this for HTML that appears on each
page of your Web site: For example, you might like today’s date and the
page’s last modified date to appear at the bottom of any page of your whole
Web site. Webmasters, being the sedentary, nerd-beast crowd that they are,
don’t want to type this information repeatedly for each HTML page that they
create. Furthermore, they don’t want to have to retype all that information
for every file if it should change. What’s a lazy techno-wizard to do? Server
Side Includes come to the rescue!
The first step is to modify your main page: in this case, index.shtml:
<html>
<head><title>My First Web Page</title></head>
<body>
Welcome to my Web site!<br>
<!--#include virtual=”footer.shtml”-->
</body>
</html>
You might notice that I removed all the Server Side Includes from before and
added a new one. The new line
<!--#include virtual=”footer.shtml”-->
tells the Web server to load the file named footer.shtml and dump its
contents into index.shtml in place of this Server Side Include. Save this
file.
Create a new text file. To the new file, add this code:
<center>
<hr width=”50%”>
Today’s date: <!--#echo var=”DATE_LOCAL” --><br>
Last Modified: <!--#echo var=”LAST_MODIFIED” --><br><br>
</center>
If you’re familiar with HTML, the first thing that might strike you is that this
file doesn’t follow proper HTML formatting. Because this file is just a chunk
of HTML that’s going to be part of a fully formed HTML file, it doesn’t need
the full treatment. Otherwise, this code is standard HTML with a few Server
Side Includes tossed in for good measure. Just to spruce things up a bit, the
text is centered with a small horizontal line above it. Save this file, giving it
the name footer.shtml.

Book VII
Chapter 4
Hosting a Web Site
with Mac OS X
Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
679
Now, whenever you want this footer to be at the bottom of any Web page on
the server, add the <!--#include virtual=”footer.shtml”--> line
from before. Besides saving you time from reconstructing the footer each
time in an HTML file, you only have to add one line of code, and Server Side
Includes take care of the rest. Even better, you can alter the footer file when-
ever you want, and the changes appear in the HTML of every page that con-
tains the footer.
When bad things happen to good Webmasters
If you’ve browsed the Web for any time at all, you’ve no doubt stumbled
across a dead link. This phenomenon occurs when you attempt to load a
Web page that no longer exists on a particular server. If you were lucky and
the server still existed, you probably saw a boring error message telling you
that the page no longer exists. Apache provides default error messages like
this for you, but that doesn’t mean you can’t improve the messages that your
visitors see — a true power user eschews defaults when creativity kicks in!
Open your httpd.conf file for editing with pico like before.
sudo pico /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
Scroll through the file until you find the ErrorDocument directives.
#    2) local redirects
#ErrorDocument 404 /missing.html
#  to redirect to local URL /missing.html
Whenever a server can’t find a page, it produces a 404 error — also well
known as “That Blankety-Blank Screen” to Web surfers around the world.
(Please excuse my clarity there.) In fact, the number 404 has entered popu-
lar slang, meaning dead or broken. Normally, Apache directs itself to a
default error message, but by removing one comment (note the now-absent
pound character at the beginning of the second line), you can specify which
file you want to display (in the form of a page for the viewer) in the case of a
404 error.
#    2) local redirects
ErrorDocument 404 /missing.html
#  to redirect to local URL /missing.html
Press Control+O to save the httpd.conf file and then press Control+X to
exit pico. Now whenever someone comes across a missing Web page on your
site, your server redirects him to a file named missing.html. Of course,
you also need to create this missing.html file. Use your favorite text
editor to create a new HTML file. To your file, add this code:

Using Mac OS X Web Sharing
680
<html>
<head><title>Uh-oh!</title></head>
<body>
Holy Toledo! <br><br>
We can’t find the page you requested. <br>
Would you like to <a href=”index.shtml”>return to the main page</a>?
<!--#include virtual=”footer.shtml”-->
</body>
</html>
Save this file, giving it the name missing.html. Save it in your Web server’s
root directory.
/Library/WebServer/Documents/missing.html
Return to the System Preferences Sharing panel, click the Internet tab, and
toggle Web Sharing off and on again. This forces your Web server to read in
the changes to the httpd.conf file.
To test it out, load a URL that you know doesn’t exist. Anything will do.
http://1270.0.0.1/some_missing_page_I_forgot_to_add.html
If you’ve configured things properly, you see a personalized Web error 
page — this way, perhaps your visitor will chuckle instead of curse when 
a dead link is encountered.
