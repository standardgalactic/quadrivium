A Preview of Calculus

The Area Problem
The origins of calculus go back at least 2500 years to the ancient Greeks, who found
areas using the “method of exhaustion.” They knew how to ﬁnd the area 
of any poly-
gon by dividing it into triangles as in Figure 1 and adding the areas of these triangles.
It is a much more difﬁcult problem to ﬁnd the area of a curved ﬁgure. The Greek
method of exhaustion was to inscribe polygons in the ﬁgure and circumscribe poly-
gons about the ﬁgure and then let the number of sides of the polygons increase. 
Figure 2 illustrates this process for the special case of a circle with inscribed regular 
polygons.
Let 
be the area of the inscribed polygon with sides. As increases, it appears
that 
becomes closer and closer to the area of the circle. We say that the area of the
circle is the limit of the areas of the inscribed polygons, and we write
The Greeks themselves did not use limits explicitly. However, by indirect reasoning,
Eudoxus (ﬁfth century B.C.) used exhaustion to prove the familiar formula for the area
of a circle:
We will use a similar idea in Chapter 5 to ﬁnd areas of regions of the type shown
in Figure 3. We will approximate the desired area 
by areas of rectangles (as in
Figure 4), let the width of the rectangles decrease, and then calculate 
as the limit of
these sums of areas of rectangles.

Calculus is fundamentally different from the mathe-
matics that you have studied previously. Calculus is
less static and more dynamic. It is concerned with
change and motion; it deals with quantities that
approach other quantities. For that reason it may be
useful to have an overview of the subject before 
beginning its intensive study. Here we give a glimpse
of some of the main ideas of calculus by showing 
how the concept of a limit arises when we attempt to
solve a variety of problems.

The Preview Module is a numeri-
cal and pictorial investigation of
the approximation of the area of a circle
by inscribed and circumscribed polygons.

The area problem is the central problem in the branch of calculus called integral
calculus. The techniques that we will develop in Chapter 5 for ﬁnding areas will also
enable us to compute the volume of a solid, the length of a curve, the force of water
against a dam, the mass and center of gravity of a rod, and the work done in pumping
water out of a tank.
The Tangent Problem
Consider the problem of trying to ﬁnd an equation of the tangent line to a curve with
equation 
at a given point . (We will give a precise deﬁnition of a tangent
line in Chapter 2. For now you can think of it as a line that touches the curve at 
as
in Figure 5.) Since we know that the point 
lies on the tangent line, we can ﬁnd the
equation of if we know its slope . The problem is that we need two points to com-
pute the slope and we know only one point,
, on To get around the problem we ﬁrst
ﬁnd an approximation to 
by taking a nearby point 
on the curve and computing
the slope 
of the secant line 
. From Figure 6 we see that
Now imagine that 
moves along the curve toward 
as in Figure 7. You can see
that the secant line rotates and approaches the tangent line as its limiting position. This
means that the slope 
of the secant line becomes closer and closer to the slope 
of the tangent line. We write
and we say that
is the limit of
as
approaches
along the curve. Since
approaches 
as 
approaches , we could also use Equation 1 to write
Speciﬁc examples of this procedure will be given in Chapter 2.
The tangent problem has given rise to the branch of calculus called differential cal-
culus, which was not invented until more than 2000 years after integral calculus. The
main ideas behind differential calculus are due to the French mathematician Pierre
Fermat (1601–1665) and were developed by the English mathematicians John Wallis
(1616–1703), Isaac Barrow (1630–1677), and Isaac Newton (1642–1727) and the
German mathematician Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716).
The two branches of calculus and their chief problems, the area problem and the
tangent problem, appear to be very different, but it turns out that there is a very close
connection between them. The tangent problem and the area problem are inverse
problems in a sense that will be described in Chapter 5.
Velocity
When we look at the speedometer of a car and read that the car is traveling at 48 mih,
what does that information indicate to us? We know that if the velocity remains con-
stant, then after an hour we will have traveled 48 mi. But if the velocity of the car
varies, what does it mean to say that the velocity at a given instant is 48 mih?

In order to analyze this question, let’s examine the motion of a car that travels along
a straight road and assume that we can measure the distance traveled by the car (in
feet) at l-second intervals as in the following chart:
As a ﬁrst step toward ﬁnding the velocity after 2 seconds have elapsed, we ﬁnd the
average velocity during the time interval 
:
Similarly, the average velocity in the time interval 
is
We have the feeling that the velocity at the instant  2 can’t be much different from
the average velocity during a short time interval starting at 
. So let’s imagine that
the distance traveled has been measured at 0.l-second time intervals as in the follow-
ing chart:
Then we can compute, for instance, the average velocity over the time interval 
:
The results of such calculations are shown in the following chart:
The average velocities over successively smaller intervals appear to be getting
closer to a number near 10, and so we expect that the velocity at exactly 
is about
10 fts. In Chapter 2 we will deﬁne the instantaneous velocity of a moving object as
the limiting value of the average velocities over smaller and smaller time intervals.
In Figure 8 we show a graphical representation of the motion of the car by plotting
the distance traveled as a function of time. If we write 
, then 
is the num-
ber of feet traveled after seconds. The average velocity in the time interval 
is

which is the same as the slope of the secant line 
in Figure 8. The velocity when
is the limiting value of this average velocity as approaches 2; that is,
and we recognize from Equation 2 that this is the same as the slope of the tangent line
to the curve at .
Thus, when we solve the tangent problem in differential calculus, we are also solv-
ing problems concerning velocities. The same techniques also enable us to solve prob-
lems involving rates of change in all of the natural and social sciences.
The Limit of a Sequence
In the ﬁfth century B.C. the Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea posed four problems, now
known as Zeno’s paradoxes, that were intended to challenge some of the ideas con-
cerning space and time that were held in his day. Zeno’s second paradox concerns a
race between the Greek hero Achilles and a tortoise that has been given a head start.
Zeno argued, as follows, that Achilles could never pass the tortoise: Suppose that
Achilles starts at position 
and the tortoise starts at position 
(see Figure 9). When
Achilles reaches the point 
, the tortoise is farther ahead at position . When
Achilles reaches 
, the tortoise is at . This process continues indeﬁnitely and
so it appears that the tortoise will always be ahead! But this deﬁes common sense.
One way of explaining this paradox is with the idea of a sequence. The succes-
sive positions of Achilles 
or the successive positions of the tortoise
form what is known as a sequence.
In general, a sequence 
is a set of numbers written in a deﬁnite order. For
instance, the sequence
can be described by giving the following formula for the th term:
We can visualize this sequence by plotting its terms on a number line as in Fig-
ure 10(a) or by drawing its graph as in Figure 10(b). Observe from either picture that
the terms of the sequence 
are becoming closer and closer to 0 as increases.
In fact we can ﬁnd terms as small as we please by making large enough. We say that
the limit of the sequence is 0, and we indicate this by writing

is used if the terms 
approach the number 
as becomes large. This means that the
numbers 
can be made as close as we like to the number 
by taking 
sufﬁciently
large.
The concept of the limit of a sequence occurs whenever we use the decimal repre-
sentation of a real number. For instance, if
then
The terms in this sequence are rational approximations to .
Let’s return to Zeno’s paradox. The successive positions of Achilles and the tor-
toise form sequences 
and 
, where 
for all . It can be shown that both
sequences have the same limit:
It is precisely at this point 
that Achilles overtakes the tortoise.
The Sum of a Series
Another of Zeno’s paradoxes, as passed on to us by Aristotle, is the following: “A man
standing in a room cannot walk to the wall. In order to do so, he would ﬁrst have 
to go half the distance, then half the remaining distance, and then again half of what
still remains. This process can always be continued and can never be ended.” (See
Figure 11.)
Of course, we know that the man can actually reach the wall, so this suggests that
perhaps the total distance can be expressed as the sum of inﬁnitely many smaller dis-
tances as follows:

Zeno was arguing that it doesn’t make sense to add inﬁnitely many numbers together.
But there are other situations in which we implicitly use inﬁnite sums. For instance,
in decimal notation, the symbol 
means
and so, in some sense, it must be true that
More generally, if 
denotes the nth digit in the decimal representation of a number,
then
Therefore, some inﬁnite sums, or inﬁnite series as they are called, have a meaning. But
we must deﬁne carefully what the sum of an inﬁnite series is.
Returning to the series in Equation 3, we denote by 
the sum of the ﬁrst 
terms
of the series. Thus
Observe that as we add more and more terms, the partial sums become closer and
closer to 1. In fact, it can be shown that by taking 
large enough (that is, by adding
sufﬁciently many terms of the series), we can make the partial sum 
as close as we
please to the number 1. It therefore seems reasonable to say that the sum of the inﬁ-
nite series is 1 and to write

In other words, the reason the sum of the series is 1 is that
In Chapter 8 we will discuss these ideas further. We will then use Newton’s idea of
combining inﬁnite series with differential and integral calculus.
Summary
We have seen that the concept of a limit arises in trying to ﬁnd the area of a region,
the slope of a tangent to a curve, the velocity of a car, or the sum of an inﬁnite series.
In each case the common theme is the calculation of a quantity as the limit of other,
easily calculated quantities. It is this basic idea of a limit that sets calculus apart from
other areas of mathematics. In fact, we could deﬁne calculus as the part of mathe-
matics that deals with limits.
Sir Isaac Newton invented his version of calculus in order to explain the motion of
the planets around the Sun. Today calculus is used in calculating the orbits of satel-
lites and spacecraft, in predicting population sizes, in estimating how fast coffee prices
rise, in forecasting weather, in measuring the cardiac output of the heart, in calcu-
lating life insurance premiums, and in a great variety of other areas. We will explore
some of these uses of calculus in this book.
In order to convey a sense of the power of the subject, we end this preview with a
list of some of the questions that you will be able to answer using calculus:
1. How can we explain the fact, illustrated in Figure 12, that the angle of eleva-
tion from an observer up to the highest point in a rainbow is 42°? (See
page 279.)
2. How can we explain the shapes of cans on supermarket shelves? (See
page 318.)
3. Where is the best place to sit in a movie theater? (See page 476.)
4. How far away from an airport should a pilot start descent? (See page 237.)
5. How can we ﬁt curves together to design shapes to represent letters on a laser
printer? (See page 236.)
6. Where should an inﬁelder position himself to catch a baseball thrown by an
outﬁelder and relay it to home plate? (See page 540.)
7. Does a ball thrown upward take longer to reach its maximum height or to fall
back to its original height? (See page 530.)
8. How can we explain the fact that planets and satellites move in elliptical
orbits? (See page 735.)
9. How can we distribute water ﬂow among turbines at a hydroelectric station so
as to maximize the total energy production? (See page 830.)
10. If a marble, a squash ball, a steel bar, and a lead pipe roll down a slope,
which of them reaches the bottom ﬁrst? (See page 900.)

Functions arise whenever one quantity depends on another. Consider the following
four situations.
A. The area 
of a circle depends on the radius of the circle. The rule that con-
nects and 
is given by the equation 
. With each positive number 
there is associated one value of , and we say that 
is a function of .
B. The human population of the world 
depends on the time . The table gives esti-
mates of the world population 
at time 
for certain years. For instance,
But for each value of the time there is a corresponding value of 
and we say
that 
is a function of .
C. The cost 
of mailing a ﬁrst-class letter depends on the weight 
of the letter.
Although there is no simple formula that connects 
and , the post ofﬁce has a
rule for determining 
when 
is known.
D. The vertical acceleration 
of the ground as measured by a seismograph during
an earthquake is a function of the elapsed time 
Figure 1 shows a graph gener-
ated by seismic activity during the Northridge earthquake that shook Los Angeles
in 1994. For a given value of 
the graph provides a corresponding value of .
Each of these examples describes a rule whereby, given a number ( , ,
, or ),
another number ( ,
,
, or ) is assigned. In each case we say that the second num-
ber is a function of the ﬁrst number.

The fundamental objects that we deal with in calculus
are functions. This chapter prepares the way for calcu-
lus by discussing the basic ideas concerning functions,
their graphs, and ways of transforming and combining
them. We stress that a function can be represented in
different ways: by an equation, in a table, by a graph,
or in words. We look at the main types of functions
that occur in calculus and describe the process of
using these functions as mathematical models of real-
world phenomena. We also discuss the use of graph-
ing calculators and graphing software for computers
and see that parametric equations provide the best
method for graphing certain types of curves.

A function
is a rule that assigns to each element in a set 
exactly one
element, called 
, in a set .
We usually consider functions for which the sets 
and 
are sets of real numbers.
The set 
is called the domain of the function. The number 
is the value of 
at
and is read “
of .” The range of 
is the set of all possible values of 
as 
varies throughout the domain. A symbol that represents an arbitrary number in the
domain of a function 
is called an independent variable. A symbol that represents
a number in the range of 
is called a dependent variable. In Example A, for
instance, r is the independent variable and A is the dependent variable.
It’s helpful to think of a function as a machine (see Figure 2). If is in the domain
of the function 
then when 
enters the machine, it’s accepted as an input and the
machine produces an output 
according to the rule of the function. Thus, we can
think of the domain as the set of all possible inputs and the range as the set of all pos-
sible outputs.
The preprogrammed functions in a calculator are good examples of a function as a
machine. For example, the square root key on your calculator is such a function. You
press the key labeled 
(or 
) and enter the input x. If 
, then 
is not in the
domain of this function; that is,
is not an acceptable input, and the calculator will
indicate an error. If 
, then an approximation to 
will appear in the display.
Thus, the 
key on your calculator is not quite the same as the exact mathematical
function 
deﬁned by 
.
Another way to picture a function is by an arrow diagram as in Figure 3. Each
arrow connects an element of 
to an element of . The arrow indicates that 
is
associated with 
is associated with , and so on.
The most common method for visualizing a function is its graph. If 
is a function
with domain , then its graph is the set of ordered pairs
(Notice that these are input-output pairs.) In other words, the graph of consists of all
points 
in the coordinate plane such that 
and is in the domain of .
The graph of a function 
gives us a useful picture of the behavior or “life history”
of a function. Since the -coordinate of any point 
on the graph is 
, we
can read the value of 
from the graph as being the height of the graph above the
point (see Figure 4). The graph of 
also allows us to picture the domain of 
on the 
-axis and its range on the -axis as in Figure 5.

EXAMPLE 1 The graph of a function 
is shown in Figure 6.

(b) What are the domain and range of ?
SOLUTION
(a) We see from Figure 6 that the point 
lies on the graph of , so the value of
at 1 is 
. (In other words, the point on the graph that lies above x  1 is
three units above the x-axis.)
When x  5, the graph lies about 0.7 unit below the x-axis, so we estimate that
.
(b) We see that 
is deﬁned when 
, so the domain of 
is the closed
interval 
. Notice that 
takes on all values from 2 to 4, so the range of 
is
EXAMPLE 2 Sketch the graph and ﬁnd the domain and range of each function.
(a)
(b)
SOLUTION
(a) The equation of the graph is 
, and we recognize this as being the
equation of a line with slope 2 and y-intercept 1. (Recall the slope-intercept form
of the equation of a line:
. See Appendix B.) This enables us to sketch
the graph of 
in Figure 7. The expression 
is deﬁned for all real numbers, so
the domain of 
is the set of all real numbers, which we denote by . The graph
shows that the range is also .
(b) Since 
and 
, we could plot the points 
and 
, together with a few other points on the graph, and join them to produce
the graph (Figure 8). The equation of the graph is 
, which represents a
parabola (see Appendix B). The domain of t is . The range of t consists of all
values of 
, that is, all numbers of the form 
. But 
for all numbers x and
any positive number y is a square. So the range of t is 
. This can
also be seen from Figure 8.

Representations of Functions
There are four possible ways to represent a function:
I verbally
(by a description in words)
I numerically
(by a table of values)
I visually
(by a graph)
I algebraically
(by an explicit formula)
If a single function can be represented in all four ways, it is often useful to go from
one representation to another to gain additional insight into the function. (In Example
2, for instance, we started with algebraic formulas and then obtained the graphs.) But
certain functions are described more naturally by one method than by another. With
this in mind, let’s reexamine the four situations that we considered at the beginning of
this section.
A. The most useful representation of the area of a circle as a function of its radius
is probably the algebraic formula 
, though it is possible to compile
a table of values or to sketch a graph (half a parabola). Because a circle has 
to have a positive radius, the domain is 
, and the range is
also 
.
B. We are given a description of the function in words:
is the human popula-
tion of the world at time t. The table of values of world population on page 11
provides a convenient representation of this function. If we plot these values,
we get the graph (called a scatter plot) in Figure 9. It too is a useful represen-
tation; the graph allows us to absorb all the data at once. What about a for-
mula? Of course, it’s impossible to devise an explicit formula that gives the
exact human population 
at any time t. But it is possible to ﬁnd an expres-
sion for a function that approximates 
. In fact, using methods explained in
Section 1.5, we obtain the approximation
and Figure 10 shows that it is a reasonably good “ﬁt.” The function 
is called
a mathematical model for population growth. In other words, it is a function
with an explicit formula that approximates the behavior of our given function.
We will see, however, that the ideas of calculus can be applied to a table of
values; an explicit formula is not necessary.

CHAPTER 1 FUNCTIONS AND MODELS

The function P is typical of the functions that arise whenever we attempt to
apply calculus to the real world. We start with a verbal description of a func-
tion. Then we may be able to construct a table of values of the function, per-
haps from instrument readings in a scientiﬁc experiment. Even though we
don’t have complete knowledge of the values of the function, we will see
throughout the book that it is still possible to perform the operations of calcu-
lus on such a function.
C. Again the function is described in words:
is the cost of mailing a ﬁrst-
class letter with weight . The rule that the U.S. Postal Service used as of 2001
is as follows: The cost is 34 cents for up to one ounce, plus 22 cents for each
successive ounce up to 11 ounces. The table of values shown in the margin is
the most convenient representation for this function, though it is possible to
sketch a graph (see Example 10).
D. The graph shown in Figure 1 is the most natural representation of the vertical
acceleration function 
. It’s true that a table of values could be compiled,
and it is even possible to devise an approximate formula. But everything a
geologist needs to know—amplitudes and patterns—can be seen easily from
the graph. (The same is true for the patterns seen in electrocardiograms of
heart patients and polygraphs for lie-detection.) Figures 11 and 12 show the
graphs of the north-south and east-west accelerations for the Northridge earth-
quake; when used in conjunction with Figure 1, they provide a great deal of
information about the earthquake.
In the next example we sketch the graph of a function that is deﬁned verbally.
EXAMPLE 3 When you turn on a hot-water faucet, the temperature 
of the water
depends on how long the water has been running. Draw a rough graph of 
as a
function of the time that has elapsed since the faucet was turned on.
SOLUTION The initial temperature of the running water is close to room temperature
because of the water that has been sitting in the pipes. When the water from the hot
water tank starts coming out,
increases quickly. In the next phase,
is constant
at the temperature of the heated water in the tank. When the tank is drained,
decreases to the temperature of the water supply. This enables us to make the rough
sketch of 
as a function of in Figure 13.

L A function deﬁned by a table of 
values is called a tabular function.

A more accurate graph of the function in Example 3 could be obtained by using a
thermometer to measure the temperature of the water at 10-second intervals. In gen-
eral, scientists collect experimental data and use them to sketch the graphs of func-
tions, as the next example illustrates.
EXAMPLE 4 The data shown in the margin come from an experiment on the lactoni-
zation of hydroxyvaleric acid at 25 C. They give the concentration 
of this acid
(in moles per liter) after minutes. Use these data to draw an approximation to the
graph of the concentration function. Then use this graph to estimate the concentra-
tion after 5 minutes.
SOLUTION We plot the ﬁve points corresponding to the data from the table in Fig-
ure 14. The curve-ﬁtting methods of Section 1.2 could be used to choose a model
and graph it. But the data points in Figure 14 look quite well behaved, so we simply
draw a smooth curve through them by hand as in Figure 15.
Then we use the graph to estimate that the concentration after 5 minutes is
mole	liter
In the following example we start with a verbal description of a function in a phys-
ical situation and obtain an explicit algebraic formula. The ability to do this is a use-
ful skill in solving calculus problems that ask for the maximum or minimum values of
quantities.
EXAMPLE 5 A rectangular storage container with an open top has a volume of 10 m .
The length of its base is twice its width. Material for the base costs $10 per square
meter; material for the sides costs $6 per square meter. Express the cost of materials
as a function of the width of the base.
SOLUTION We draw a diagram as in Figure 16 and introduce notation by letting
and
be the width and length of the base, respectively, and 
be the height.
The area of the base is 
, so the cost, in dollars, of the material for
the base is 
. Two of the sides have area 
and the other two have area 
, so the cost of the material for the sides is 
. The total cost is
therefore
To express 
as a function of 
alone, we need to eliminate 
and we do so by using
the fact that the volume is 10 m . Thus

Substituting this into the expression for , we have

EXAMPLE 6 Find the domain of each function.

(b)
SOLUTION
(a) Because the square root of a negative number is not deﬁned (as a real number),
the domain of

. This is equivalent to
, so the domain is the interval 
.
(b) Since

which could also be written in interval notation as
The graph of a function is a curve in the 
-plane. But the question arises: Which
curves in the 
-plane are graphs of functions? This is answered by the following test.
The Vertical Line Test A curve in the 
-plane is the graph of a function of if
and only if no vertical line intersects the curve more than once.
The reason for the truth of the Vertical Line Test can be seen in Figure 17. If each
vertical line 
intersects a curve only once, at 
, then exactly one functional
value is deﬁned by 
. But if a line 
intersects the curve twice, at 
and 
, then the curve can’t represent a function because a function can’t assign
two different values to .

I In setting up applied functions as in
Example 5, it may be useful to review
the principles of problem solving as dis-
cussed on page 88, particularly Step 1:
Understand the Problem.
L If a function is given by a formula
and the domain is not stated explicitly,
the convention is that the domain is the
set of all numbers for which the formula
makes sense and deﬁnes a real number.

For example, the parabola 
shown in Figure 18(a) is not the graph of a
function of because, as you can see, there are vertical lines that intersect the parabola
twice. The parabola, however, does contain the graphs of two functions of . Notice
that 
implies 
, so 
. So the upper and lower
halves of the parabola are the graphs of the functions 
[from Example
6(a)] and 
. [See Figures 18(b) and (c).] We observe that if we reverse
the roles of and , then the equation 
does deﬁne as a function
of 
(with 
as the independent variable and 
as the dependent variable) and the
parabola now appears as the graph of the function .
Piecewise Defined Functions
The functions in the following four examples are deﬁned by different formulas in dif-
ferent parts of their domains.
EXAMPLE 7 A function 
is deﬁned by
Evaluate

and sketch the graph.
SOLUTION Remember that a function is a rule. For this particular function the rule is
the following: First look at the value of the input . If it happens that 
, then the
value of

How do we draw the graph of ? We observe that if

,
so the part of the graph of

must coin-
cide with the line 
, which has slope 
and -intercept 1. If 
, then
, so the part of the graph of 
that lies to the right of the line 
must
coincide with the graph of 
, which is a parabola. This enables us to sketch the
graph in Figure l9. The solid dot indicates that the point 
is included on the
graph; the open dot indicates that the point 
is excluded from the graph.

The next example of a piecewise deﬁned function is the absolute value function.
Recall that the absolute value of a number , denoted by 
, is the distance from 
to 
on the real number line. Distances are always positive or , so we have
for every number 
For example,
In general, we have
(Remember that if is negative, then 
is positive.)
EXAMPLE 8 Sketch the graph of the absolute value function 
.
SOLUTION From the preceding discussion we know that
Using the same method as in Example 7, we see that the graph of 
coincides with
the line 
to the right of the -axis and coincides with the line
to the
left of the -axis (see Figure 20).
EXAMPLE 9 Find a formula for the function 
graphed in Figure 21.
SOLUTION The line through

its equation is

We also see that the graph of

information together, we have the following three-piece formula for :
EXAMPLE 10 In Example C at the beginning of this section we considered the cost
of mailing a ﬁrst-class letter with weight . In effect, this is a piecewise
deﬁned function because, from the table of values, we have
The graph is shown in Figure 22. You can see why functions similar to this one are
called step functions—they jump from one value to the next. Such functions will be
studied in Chapter 2.
Symmetry
If a function 
satisﬁes 
for every number 
in its domain, then 
is
called an even function. For instance, the function 
is even because
The geometric signiﬁcance of an even function is that its graph is symmetric with
respect to the -axis (see Figure 23). This means that if we have plotted the graph of
for 
, we obtain the entire graph simply by reﬂecting about the -axis. 
If 
satisﬁes 
for every number in its domain, then 
is called an
odd function. For example, the function 
is odd because
The graph of an odd function is symmetric about the origin (see Figure 24). If we
already have the graph of 
for 
, we can obtain the entire graph by rotating
through 
about the origin.

neither even nor odd.

graph of h is symmetric neither about the y-axis nor about the origin.
Increasing and Decreasing Functions
The graph shown in Figure 26 rises from 
to , falls from 
to , and rises again
from 
to . The function 
is said to be increasing on the interval 
, decreasing
on

between

. We use this as the deﬁning prop-
erty of an increasing function.
A function 
is called increasing on an interval if
It is called decreasing on if
In the deﬁnition of an increasing function it is important to realize that the inequal-
ity 
must be satisﬁed for every pair of numbers 
and 
in

A mathematical model is a mathematical description (often by means of a function
or an equation) of a real-world phenomenon such as the size of a population, the
demand for a product, the speed of a falling object, the concentration of a product in
1.2

a chemical reaction, the life expectancy of a person at birth, or the cost of emission
reductions. The purpose of the model is to understand the phenomenon and perhaps
to make predictions about future behavior.
Figure 1 illustrates the process of mathematical modeling. Given a real-world prob-
lem, our ﬁrst task is to formulate a mathematical model by identifying and naming the
independent and dependent variables and making assumptions that simplify the phe-
nomenon enough to make it mathematically tractable. We use our knowledge of the
physical situation and our mathematical skills to obtain equations that relate the vari-
ables. In situations where there is no physical law to guide us, we may need to collect
data (either from a library or the Internet or by conducting our own experiments) and
examine the data in the form of a table in order to discern patterns. From this numeri-
cal representation of a function we may wish to obtain a graphical representation by
plotting the data. The graph might even suggest a suitable algebraic formula in some
cases.
The second stage is to apply the mathematics that we know (such as the calculus
that will be developed throughout this book) to the mathematical model that we have
formulated in order to derive mathematical conclusions. Then, in the third stage, we
take those mathematical conclusions and interpret them as information about the orig-
inal real-world phenomenon by way of offering explanations or making predictions.
The ﬁnal step is to test our predictions by checking against new real data. If the pre-
dictions don’t compare well with reality, we need to reﬁne our model or to formulate
a new model and start the cycle again.
A mathematical model is never a completely accurate representation of a physical
situation—it is an idealization. A good model simpliﬁes reality enough to permit
mathematical calculations but is accurate enough to provide valuable conclusions. It
is important to realize the limitations of the model. In the end, Mother Nature has the
ﬁnal say.
There are many different types of functions that can be used to model relationships
observed in the real world. In what follows, we discuss the behavior and graphs 
of these functions and give examples of situations appropriately modeled by such
functions.
Linear Models
When we say that y is a linear function of x, we mean that the graph of the function
is a line, so we can use the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line to write a for-
mula for the function as
where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept.

A characteristic feature of linear functions is that they grow at a constant rate. For
instance, Figure 2 shows a graph of the linear function 
and a table of
sample values. Notice that whenever x increases by 0.1, the value of 
increases by
0.3. So 
increases three times as fast as x. Thus, the slope of the graph 
,
namely 3, can be interpreted as the rate of change of y with respect to x.
EXAMPLE 1
(a) As dry air moves upward, it expands and cools. If the ground temperature is
and the temperature at a height of 1 km is 
, express the temperature T
(in °C) as a function of the height h (in kilometers), assuming that a linear model is
appropriate.
(b) Draw the graph of the function in part (a). What does the slope represent?
(c) What is the temperature at a height of 2.5 km?
SOLUTION
(a) Because we are assuming that T is a linear function of h, we can write
We are given that 
when 
, so
In other words, the y-intercept is 
.
We are also given that 
when 
, so
The slope of the line is therefore
and the required linear func-
tion is
(b) The graph is sketched in Figure 3. The slope is 
, and this repre-
sents the rate of change of temperature with respect to height.
(c) At a height of 
, the temperature is
If there is no physical law or principle to help us formulate a model, we construct
an empirical model, which is based entirely on collected data. We seek a curve that
“ﬁts” the data in the sense that it captures the basic trend of the data points.

EXAMPLE 2 Table 1 lists the average carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere, meas-
ured in parts per million at Mauna Loa Observatory from 1980 to 1998. Use the data
in Table 1 to ﬁnd a model for the carbon dioxide level.
SOLUTION We use the data in Table 1 to make the scatter plot in Figure 4, where t
represents time (in years) and C represents the 
level (in parts per million, ppm).
Notice that the data points appear to lie close to a straight line, so it’s natural to
choose a linear model in this case. But there are many possible lines that approxi-
mate these data points, so which one should we use? From the graph, it appears that
one possibility is the line that passes through the ﬁrst and last data points. The slope
of this line is
and its equation is
or
Equation 1 gives one possible linear model for the carbon dioxide level; it is
graphed in Figure 5.
Although our model ﬁts the data reasonably well, it gives values higher than most
of the actual 
levels. A better linear model is obtained by a procedure from

statistics called linear regression. If we use a graphing calculator, we enter the data
from Table 1 into the data editor and choose the linear regression command. (With
Maple we use the ﬁt[leastsquare] command in the stats package; with Mathematica
we use the Fit command.) The machine gives the slope and y-intercept of the regres-
sion line as
So our least squares model for the 
level is
In Figure 6 we graph the regression line as well as the data points. Comparing
with Figure 5, we see that it gives a better ﬁt than our previous linear model.
EXAMPLE 3 Use the linear model given by Equation 2 to estimate the average 
level for 1987 and to predict the level for the year 2010. According to this model,
when will the 
level exceed 400 parts per million?
SOLUTION Using Equation 2 with t  1987, we estimate that the average 
level in
1987 was
This is an example of interpolation because we have estimated a value between
observed values. (In fact, the Mauna Loa Observatory reported that the average 
level in 1987 was 348.8 ppm, so our estimate is quite accurate.)
With 
, we get
So we predict that the average 
level in the year 2010 will be 384.5 ppm. This 
is an example of extrapolation because we have predicted a value outside the region
of observations. Consequently, we are far less certain about the accuracy of our
prediction.
Using Equation 2, we see that the 
level exceeds 400 ppm when
Solving this inequality, we get

CHAPTER 1 FUNCTIONS AND MODELS
L A computer or graphing calculator
ﬁnds the regression line by the method
of least squares, which is to minimize
the sum of the squares of the vertical 
distances between the data points and
the line. The details are explained in
Section 11.7.

We therefore predict that the 
level will exceed 400 ppm by the year 2020. 
This prediction is somewhat risky because it involves a time quite remote from our
observations.
Polynomials
A function 
is called a polynomial if
where 
is a nonnegative integer and the numbers 
are constants,
which are called the coefﬁcients of the polynomial. The domain of any polynomial is
If the leading coefﬁcient 
, then the degree of the polynomial 
is . For example, the function
is a polynomial of degree 6.
A polynomial of degree 1 is of the form 
and so it is a linear func-
tion. A polynomial of degree 2 is of the form 
and is called a
quadratic function. The graph of P is always a parabola obtained by shifting the
parabola 
, as we will see in the next section. The parabola opens upward if
and downward if 
. (See Figure 7.)
A polynomial of degree 3 is of the form
and is called a cubic function. Figure 8 shows the graph of a cubic function in part
(a) and graphs of polynomials of degrees 4 and 5 in parts (b) and (c). We will see later
why the graphs have these shapes.

Polynomials are commonly used to model various quantities that occur in the nat-
ural and social sciences. For instance, in Section 3.3 we will explain why economists
often use a polynomial 
to represent the cost of producing 
units of a commod-
ity. In the following example we use a quadratic function to model the fall of a ball.
EXAMPLE 4 A ball is dropped from the upper observation deck of the CN Tower,
450 m above the ground, and its height h above the ground is recorded at 1-second
intervals in Table 2. Find a model to ﬁt the data and use the model to predict the
time at which the ball hits the ground.
SOLUTION We draw a scatter plot of the data in Figure 9 and observe that a linear
model is inappropriate. But it looks as if the data points might lie on a parabola, so
we try a quadratic model instead. Using a graphing calculator or computer algebra
system (which uses the least squares method), we obtain the following quadratic
model:
In Figure 10 we plot the graph of Equation 3 together with the data points and
see that the quadratic model gives a very good ﬁt.
The ball hits the ground when 
, so we solve the quadratic equation
The quadratic formula gives
The positive root is 
, so we predict that the ball will hit the ground after
about 9.7 seconds.
Power Functions
A function of the form 
, where 
is a constant, is called a power function.
We consider several cases.

The graphs of

polynomials with only one term.) We already know the shape of the graphs of

[a parabola, see Example 2(b) in
Section 1.1].

The general shape of the graph of 
depends on whether 
is even or
odd. If 
is even, then 
is an even function and its graph is similar to the
parabola 
. If 
is odd, then 
is an odd function and its graph is simi-
lar to that of 
. Notice from Figure 12, however, that as 
increases, the graph
of

is
smaller,
is even smaller,
is smaller still, and so on.)

. For 
we have the cube root function
whose domain is 
(recall that every real number has a cube root) and
whose graph is shown in Figure 13(b). The graph of

The graph of the reciprocal function
is shown in Figure 14. Its
graph has the equation 
, or 
, and is a hyperbola with the coordinate
axes as its asymptotes.
This function arises in physics and chemistry in connection with Boyle’s Law,
which says that, when the temperature is constant, the volume of a gas is inversely
proportional to the pressure:
where C is a constant. Thus, the graph of V as a function of P (see Figure 15) has
the same general shape as the right half of Figure 14.
Another instance in which a power function is used to model a physical phenom-
enon is discussed in Exercise 20.
Rational Functions
A rational function
is a ratio of two polynomials:
where
and
are polynomials. The domain consists of all values of
such that
. A simple example of a rational function is the function 
, whose
domain is 
; this is the reciprocal function graphed in Figure 14. The function
is a rational function with domain 
. Its graph is shown in Figure 16.
Algebraic Functions
A function 
is called an algebraic function if it can be constructed using algebraic
operations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and taking roots)
starting with polynomials. Any rational function is automatically an algebraic func-
tion. Here are two more examples:

When we sketch algebraic functions in Chapter 4 we will see that their graphs can
assume a variety of shapes. Figure 17 illustrates some of the possibilities.
An example of an algebraic function occurs in the theory of relativity. The mass of
a particle with velocity is
where 
is the rest mass of the particle and 
km	s is the speed of light
in a vacuum.
Trigonometric Functions
Trigonometry and the trigonometric functions are reviewed on Reference Page 2 and
also in Appendix C. In calculus the convention is that radian measure is always 
used (except when otherwise indicated). For example, when we use the function
, it is understood that 
means the sine of the angle whose radian
measure is . Thus, the graphs of the sine and cosine functions are as shown in Fig-
ure 18.
Notice that for both the sine and cosine functions the domain is 
and the
range is the closed interval 
. Thus, for all values of we have

Also, the zeros of the sine function occur at the integer multiples of ; that is,
An important property of the sine and cosine functions is that they are periodic
functions and have period 
. This means that, for all values of ,
The periodic nature of these functions makes them suitable for modeling repetitive
phenomena such as tides, vibrating springs, and sound waves. For instance, in
Example 4 in Section 1.3 we will see that a reasonable model for the number of hours
of daylight in Philadelphia t days after January 1 is given by the function
The tangent function is related to the sine and cosine functions by the equation
and its graph is shown in Figure 19. It is undeﬁned when 
, that is, when
,
Its range is
. Notice that the tangent function has per-

The remaining three trigonometric functions (cosecant, secant, and cotangent) are 
the reciprocals of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions. Their graphs are shown in
Appendix C.
Exponential Functions
These are the functions of the form 
, where the base is a positive constant.
The graphs of 
and 
are shown in Figure 20. In both cases the domain
is 
and the range is 
.
Exponential functions will be studied in detail in Section 1.5 and we will see that
they are useful for modeling many natural phenomena, such as population growth (if
) and radioactive decay (if a  1.

Logarithmic Functions
These are the functions 
, where the base 
is a positive constant. They
are the inverse functions of the exponential functions and will be studied in Sec-
tion 1.6. Figure 21 shows the graphs of four logarithmic functions with various bases.
In each case the domain is 
, the range is 
, and the function increases
slowly when 
.
Transcendental Functions
These are functions that are not algebraic. The set of transcendental functions includes
the trigonometric, inverse trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions, but
it also includes a vast number of other functions that have never been named. In
Chapter 8 we will study transcendental functions that are deﬁned as sums of inﬁnite
series.

In this section we start with the basic functions we discussed in Section 1.2 and obtain
new functions by shifting, stretching, and reﬂecting their graphs. We also show how to
combine pairs of functions by the standard arithmetic operations and by composition.
Transformations of Functions
By applying certain transformations to the graph of a given function we can obtain the
graphs of certain related functions. This will give us the ability to sketch the graphs of
many functions quickly by hand. It will also enable us to write equations for given
graphs. Let’s ﬁrst consider translations. If c is a positive number, then the graph of
is just the graph of 
shifted upward a distance of c units
(because each y-coordinate is increased by the same number c). Likewise, if
, where 
, then the value of at x is the same as the value of 
at
(c units to the left of x). Therefore, the graph of 
is just the graph
of

SOLUTION The graph of the square root function 
, obtained from Figure 13 
in Section 1.2, is shown in Figure 4(a). In the other parts of the ﬁgure we sketch
by shifting 2 units downward,
by shifting 2 units to the
right,
by reﬂecting about the -axis,
by stretching vertically by a
factor of 2, and 
by reﬂecting about the -axis.
EXAMPLE 2 Sketch the graph of the function 
SOLUTION Completing the square, we write the equation of the graph as
This means we obtain the desired graph by starting with the parabola 
and
shifting 3 units to the left and then 1 unit upward (see Figure 5).

get 
(See Figure 8.)
EXAMPLE 4 Figure 9 shows graphs of the number of hours of daylight as functions 
of the time of the year at several latitudes. Given that Philadelphia is located at
approximately 
latitude, ﬁnd a function that models the length of daylight at
Philadelphia.
SOLUTION Notice that each curve resembles a shifted and stretched sine function. By
looking at the blue curve we see that, at the latitude of Philadelphia, daylight lasts
about 14.8 hours on June 21 and 9.2 hours on December 21, so the amplitude of 
the curve (the factor by which we have to stretch the sine curve vertically) is
.
By what factor do we need to stretch the sine curve horizontally if we measure
the time t in days? Because there are about 365 days in a year, the period of our
model should be 365. But the period of 
is 
, so the horizontal stretching
factor is 
.
We also notice that the curve begins its cycle on March 21, the 80th day of the
year, so we have to shift the curve 80 units to the right. In addition, we shift it
12 units upward. Therefore, we model the length of daylight in Philadelphia on the
tth day of the year by the function
Another transformation of some interest is taking the absolute value of a function.

: The part of the graph that lies above the -axis
remains the same; the part that lies below the -axis is reﬂected about the -axis.
EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the graph of the function

SOLUTION We ﬁrst graph the parabola 
in Figure 10(a) by shifting the
parabola 
downward 1 unit. We see that the graph lies below the x-axis when
, so we reﬂect that part of the graph about the x-axis to obtain the graph
of 
in Figure 10(b).
Combinations of Functions
Two functions 
and can be combined to form new functions 
,
,
, and
in a manner similar to the way we add, subtract, multiply, and divide real numbers.
If we deﬁne the sum 
by the equation
then the right side of Equation 1 makes sense if both 
and 
are deﬁned, that is,
if x belongs to the domain of 
and also to the domain of . If the domain of 
is A
and the domain of 
is B, then the domain of 
is the intersection of these
domains, that is,
.
Notice that the 
sign on the left side of Equation 1 stands for the operation of
addition of functions, but the 
sign on the right side of the equation stands for addi-
tion of the numbers
and 
.
Similarly, we can deﬁne the difference 
and the product 
, and their domains
are also 
. But in deﬁning the quotient 
we must remember not to divide by 0.

Suppose that we don’t have explicit formulas for f and t but we do have tables of

lowing example shows.

In a similar way we estimate the values of h in the following table:
We use these values to graph the composite function h in Figure 16. If we want a
more accurate graph, we could apply this procedure to more values of x.
It is possible to take the composition of three or more functions. For instance, the

In this section we assume that you have access to a graphing calculator or a computer
with graphing software. We will see that the use of such a device enables us to graph
more complicated functions and to solve more complex problems than would other-
wise be possible. We also point out some of the pitfalls that can occur with these
machines.

Graphing calculators and computers can give very accurate graphs of functions.
But we will see in Chapter 4 that only through the use of calculus can we be sure that
we have uncovered all the interesting aspects of a graph.
A graphing calculator or computer displays a rectangular portion of the graph of a
function in a display window or viewing screen, which we refer to as a viewing rect-
angle. The default screen often gives an incomplete or misleading picture, so it is
important to choose the viewing rectangle with care. If we choose the -values to
range from a minimum value of 
to a maximum value of 
and the
-values to range from a minimum of 
to a maximum of 
, then the
visible portion of the graph lies in the rectangle
shown in Figure 1. We refer to this rectangle as the
by 
viewing rectangle.
The machine draws the graph of a function 
much as you would. It plots points of
the form 
for a certain number of equally spaced values of between and .
If an -value is not in the domain of , or if 
lies outside the viewing rectangle,
it moves on to the next -value. The machine connects each point to the preceding
plotted point to form a representation of the graph of .
EXAMPLE 1 Draw the graph of the function 
in each of the following
viewing rectangles.
(a)

(b)

(c)

SOLUTION For part (a) we select the range by setting min
,
max
,
min
, and max
. The resulting graph is shown in Figure 2(a). The 
display window is blank! A moment’s thought provides the explanation: Notice 
that 
for all , so 
for all . Thus, the range of the function
is 
. This means that the graph of 
lies entirely outside the
viewing rectangle 
by 
.
The graphs for the viewing rectangles in parts (b), (c), and (d) are also shown in
Figure 2. Observe that we get a more complete picture in parts (c) and (d), but in
part (d) it is not clear that the -intercept is 3.
We see from Example 1 that the choice of a viewing rectangle can make a big dif-
ference in the appearance of a graph. Sometimes it’s necessary to change to a larger
viewing rectangle to obtain a more complete picture, a more global view, of the graph.
In the next example we see that knowledge of the domain and range of a function
sometimes provides us with enough information to select a good viewing rectangle.

EXAMPLE 2 Determine an appropriate viewing rectangle for the function
and use it to graph .
SOLUTION The expression for 
is deﬁned when
Therefore, the domain of 
is the interval 
. Also,
so the range of 
is the interval 
.
We choose the viewing rectangle so that the -interval is somewhat larger than
the domain and the -interval is larger than the range. Taking the viewing rectangle
to be 
by 
, we get the graph shown in Figure 3.
EXAMPLE 3 Graph the function 
.
SOLUTION Here the domain is , the set of all real numbers. That doesn’t help us
choose a viewing rectangle. Let’s experiment. If we start with the viewing rectangle
by 
, we get the graph in Figure 4. It appears blank, but actually the
graph is so nearly vertical that it blends in with the -axis.
If we change the viewing rectangle to 
by 
, we get the picture
shown in Figure 5(a). The graph appears to consist of vertical lines, but we know
that can’t be correct. If we look carefully while the graph is being drawn, we see
that the graph leaves the screen and reappears during the graphing process. This
indicates that we need to see more in the vertical direction, so we change the view-
ing rectangle to 
by 
. The resulting graph is shown in Fig-
ure 5(b). It still doesn’t quite reveal all the main features of the function, so we try
by 
in Figure 5(c). Now we are more conﬁdent that we
have arrived at an appropriate viewing rectangle. In Chapter 4 we will be able to see
that the graph shown in Figure 5(c) does indeed reveal all the main features of the
function.
EXAMPLE 4 Graph the function 
in an appropriate viewing rectangle.
SOLUTION Figure 6(a) shows the graph of 
produced by a graphing calculator using
the viewing rectangle 
by 
. At ﬁrst glance the graph appears to
be reasonable. But if we change the viewing rectangle to the ones shown in the

following parts of Figure 6, the graphs look very different. Something strange is
happening.
In order to explain the big differences in appearance of these graphs and to 
ﬁnd an appropriate viewing rectangle, we need to ﬁnd the period of the function
We know that the function 
has period 
and the graph 
of 
is compressed horizontally by a factor of 50, so the period of
is
This suggests that we should deal only with small values of in order to show just 
a few oscillations of the graph. If we choose the viewing rectangle
by
, we get the graph shown in Figure 7.
Now we see what went wrong in Figure 6. The oscillations of
are so
rapid that when the calculator plots points and joins them, it misses most of the
maximum and minimum points and therefore gives a very misleading impression of
the graph.
We have seen that the use of an inappropriate viewing rectangle can give a mis-
leading impression of the graph of a function. In Examples 1 and 3 we solved the
problem by changing to a larger viewing rectangle. In Example 4 we had to make the
viewing rectangle smaller. In the next example we look at a function for which there
is no single viewing rectangle that reveals the true shape of the graph.
EXAMPLE 5 Graph the function 
.
SOLUTION Figure 8 shows the graph of 
produced by a graphing calculator with view-
ing rectangle 
by 
. It looks much like the graph of 
,
but perhaps with some bumps attached. If we zoom in to the viewing rectangle
by 
, we can see much more clearly the shape of these bumps
in Figure 9. The reason for this behavior is that the second term,
, is very

SOLUTION Figure 10(a) shows the graph produced by a graphing calculator with

the calculator produced a steep line segment from the top to the bottom of the

. We can eliminate the extraneous near-
vertical line by experimenting with a change of scale. When we change to the
smaller viewing rectangle 
by 
on this particular calculator, we
obtain the much better graph in Figure 10(b).
EXAMPLE 7 Graph the function 
.
SOLUTION Some graphing devices display the graph shown in Figure 11, whereas
others produce a graph like that in Figure 12. We know from Section 1.2 (Figure 13)
that the graph in Figure 12 is correct, so what happened in Figure 11? The explana-
tion is that some machines compute the cube root of using a logarithm, which is
not deﬁned if is negative, so only the right half of the graph is produced.

L Another way to avoid the extraneous
line is to change the graphing mode on
the calculator so that the dots are not
connected. Alternatively, we could zoom
in using the Zoom Decimal mode.

You should experiment with your own machine to see which of these two graphs
is produced. If you get the graph in Figure 11, you can obtain the correct picture by
graphing the function 
Notice that this function is equal to 
(except when 
).
To understand how the expression for a function relates to its graph, it’s helpful to
graph a family of functions, that is, a collection of functions whose equations are
related. In the next example we graph members of a family of cubic polynomials.
EXAMPLE 8 Graph the function 
for various values of the number . How
does the graph change when is changed?
SOLUTION Figure 13 shows the graphs of 
for 
, , ,
, and 
.
We see that, for positive values of , the graph increases from left to right with no
maximum or minimum points (peaks or valleys). When 
, the curve is ﬂat at
the origin. When is negative, the curve has a maximum point and a minimum
point. As decreases, the maximum point becomes higher and the minimum point
lower.
EXAMPLE 9 Find the solution of the equation 
correct to two decimal
places.
SOLUTION The solutions of the equation 
are the -coordinates of the points
of intersection of the curves 
and 
. From Figure 14(a) we see that
there is only one solution and it lies between 0 and 1. Zooming in to the viewing
rectangle 
by 
, we see from Figure 14(b) that the root lies between 0.7
and 0.8. So we zoom in further to the viewing rectangle 
by 
in
Figure 14(c). By moving the cursor to the intersection point of the two curves, or by
inspection and the fact that the -scale is 0.01, we see that the root of the equation is
about 0.74. (Many calculators have a built-in intersection feature.)

The function 
is called an exponential function because the variable, x, is the
exponent. It should not be confused with the power function 
, in which the
variable is the base.
In general, an exponential function is a function of the form
where 
is a positive constant. Let’s recall what this means.
If 
, a positive integer, then
n factors
If 
, and if 
, where 
is a positive integer, then
If is a rational number,
, where 
and 
are integers and 
, then
But what is the meaning of 
if x is an irrational number? For instance, what is meant
by 
or

To help us answer this question we ﬁrst look at the graph of the function 
,
where x is rational. A representation of this graph is shown in Figure 1. We want to
enlarge the domain of 
to include both rational and irrational numbers.
There are holes in the graph in Figure 1 corresponding to irrational values of x. We
want to ﬁll in the holes by deﬁning 
, where 
, so that 
is an increasing
function. In particular, since the irrational number 
satisﬁes
we must have
and we know what 
and 
mean because 1.7 and 1.8 are rational numbers.
Similarly, if we use better approximations for 
, we obtain better approximations 
for 
:

It can be shown that there is exactly one number that is greater than all of the 
numbers
. . .
and less than all of the numbers
. . .
We deﬁne 
to be this number. Using the preceding approximation process we can
compute it correct to six decimal places:
Similarly, we can deﬁne 
(or 
, if 
) where x is any irrational number.
Figure 2 shows how all the holes in Figure 1 have been ﬁlled to complete the graph of
the function

The graphs of members of the family of functions 
are shown in Figure 3 for
various values of the base a. Notice that all of these graphs pass through the same
point 
because 
for 
. Notice also that as the base a gets larger, the
exponential function grows more rapidly (for 
).
You can see from Figure 3 that there are basically three kinds of exponential func-
tions 
. If 
, the exponential function decreases; if 
, it is a con-
stant; and if 
, it increases. These three cases are illustrated in Figure 4. Observe
that if 
, then the exponential function 
has domain  and range 
.
Notice also that, since 
, the graph of 
is just the reﬂec-
tion of the graph of 
about the -axis.
One reason for the importance of the exponential function lies in the following
properties. If x and y are rational numbers, then these laws are well known from ele-
mentary algebra. It can be proved that they remain true for arbitrary real numbers 
x and y.
Laws of Exponents If a and b are positive numbers and x and y are any real num-
bers, then

EXAMPLE 1 Sketch the graph of the function 
and determine its domain
and range.
SOLUTION First we reﬂect the graph of 
(shown in Figure 2) about the x-axis 
to get the graph of 
in Figure 5(b). Then we shift the graph of 
upward three units to obtain the graph of 
in Figure 5(c). The domain is

EXAMPLE 2 Use a graphing device to compare the exponential function 
and the power function 
. Which function grows more quickly when x is
large?
SOLUTION Figure 6 shows both functions graphed in the viewing rectangle 
by 
. We see that the graphs intersect three times, but for 
, the graph of
stays above the graph of

shows that for large values of x, the exponential function 
grows far more
rapidly than the power function 
.
Applications of Exponential Functions
The exponential function occurs very frequently in mathematical models of nature and
society. Here we indicate brieﬂy how it arises in the description of population growth 
and radioactive decay. In later chapters we will pursue these and other applications in
greater detail.
First we consider a population of bacteria in a homogeneous nutrient medium.
Suppose that by sampling the population at certain intervals it is determined that the
population doubles every hour. If the number of bacteria at time t is 
, where t is

L For a review of reﬂecting and

L Example 2 shows that 
increases more quickly than 
. 
To demonstrate just how quickly
increases, let’s perform 
the following thought experiment.
Suppose we start with a piece of paper
a thousandth of an inch thick and we
fold it in half 50 times. Each time we
fold the paper in half, the thickness of
the paper doubles, so the thickness of 
the resulting paper would be 
inches. How thick do you think that is?
It works out to be more than 17 million
miles!

measured in hours, and the initial population is 
, then we have
It seems from this pattern that, in general,
This population function is a constant multiple of the exponential function 
, so
it exhibits the rapid growth that we observed in Figures 2 and 7. Under ideal con-
ditions (unlimited space and nutrition and freedom from disease) this exponential
growth is typical of what actually occurs in nature.
What about the human population? Table 1 shows data for the population of the
world in the 20th century and Figure 8 shows the corresponding scatter plot.
The pattern of the data points in Figure 8 suggests exponential growth, so we use
a graphing calculator with exponential regression capability to apply the method of
least squares and obtain the exponential model
Figure 9 shows the graph of this exponential function together with the original data
points. We see that the exponential curve ﬁts the data reasonably well. The period of
relatively slow population growth is explained by the two world wars and the depres-
sion of the 1930s.

(c) Use a graphing device to graph 
and use the graph to estimate the time
required for the mass to be reduced to 5 mg.
SOLUTION
(a) The mass is initially 24 mg and is halved during each 25-year period, so
From this pattern, it appears that the mass remaining after t years is
This is an exponential function with base 
.
(b) The mass that remains after 40 years is
(c) We use a graphing calculator or computer to graph the function
in Figure 10. We also graph the line 
and use the cursor to
estimate that 
when 
. So the mass of the sample will be reduced to
5 mg after about 57 years.
The Number e
Of all possible bases for an exponential function, there is one that is most convenient
for the purposes of calculus. The choice of a base a is inﬂuenced by the way the graph
of 
crosses the y-axis. Figures 11 and 12 show the tangent lines to the graphs

. (Tangent lines will be deﬁned precisely in
Section 2.6. For present purposes, you can think of the tangent line to an exponential
graph at a point as the line that touches the graph only at that point.) If we measure
the slopes of these tangent lines, we ﬁnd that 
for 
and 
for
.
It turns out, as we will see in Chapter 3, that some of the formulas of calculus will
be greatly simpliﬁed if we choose the base a so that the slope of the tangent line to
at 
is exactly 1 (see Figure 13). In fact, there is such a number and it is
denoted by the letter e. (This notation was chosen by the Swiss mathematician Leon-
hard Euler in 1727, probably because it is the ﬁrst letter of the word exponential.) In
view of Figures 11 and 12, it comes as no surprise that the number e lies between 2
and 3 and the graph of 
lies between the graphs of 
and 
(see Fig-
ure 14). In Chapter 3 we will see that the value of e, correct to ﬁve decimal places, is
EXAMPLE 4 Graph the function 
and state the domain and range.
SOLUTION We start with the graph of 
from Figures 13 and 15(a) and reﬂect
about the y-axis to get the graph of 
in Figure 15(b). (Notice that the graph
crosses the y-axis with a slope of 1). Then we compress the graph vertically by a
factor of 2 to obtain the graph of 
in Figure 15(c). Finally, we shift the
graph downward one unit to get the desired graph in Figure 15(d). The domain is 
and the range is 
.
How far to the right do you think we would have to go for the height of the graph
of 
to exceed a million? The next example demonstrates the rapid growth of this
function by providing an answer that might surprise you.

Table 1 gives data from an experiment in which a bacteria culture started with 100
bacteria in a limited nutrient medium; the size of the bacteria population was recorded
at hourly intervals. The number of bacteria N is a function of the time t:
.
Suppose, however, that the biologist changes her point of view and becomes inter-
ested in the time required for the population to reach various levels. In other words,
she is thinking of t as a function of N. This function is called the inverse function of f,
denoted by
, and read “f inverse.” Thus,
is the time required for the
population level to reach N. The values of

(any two inputs in 
have different outputs), whereas 
does take on the same value
twice (both 2 and 3 have the same output, 4). In symbols,
but
Functions that have this latter property are called one-to-one functions.
Definition A function 
is called a one-to-one function if it never takes on
the same value twice; that is,
If a horizontal line intersects the graph of 
in more than one point, then we see
from Figure 2 that there are numbers 
and 
such that 
. This means
that is not one-to-one. Therefore, we have the following geometric method for deter-
mining whether a function is one-to-one.
Horizontal Line Test
A function is one-to-one if and only if no horizontal line
intersects its graph more than once.
EXAMPLE 1 Is the function 
one-to-one?
SOLUTION 1 If 
, then 
(two different numbers can’t have the same
cube). Therefore, by Deﬁnition 1,
is one-to-one.
SOLUTION 2 From Figure 3 we see that no horizontal line intersects the graph of
more than once. Therefore, by the Horizontal Line Test,
is one-to-one.
EXAMPLE 2 Is the function 
one-to-one?
SOLUTION 1 This function is not one-to-one because, for instance,
and so 1 and 
have the same output.
SOLUTION 2 From Figure 4 we see that there are horizontal lines that intersect the
graph of more than once. Therefore, by the Horizontal Line Test,
is not one-to-
one.
One-to-one functions are important because they are precisely the functions that
possess inverse functions according to the following deﬁnition.
Definition Let 
be a one-to-one function with domain 
and range .
Then its inverse function
has domain 
and range 
and is deﬁned by
for any in .

The ﬁrst cancellation equation says that if we start with , apply , and then apply 
we arrive back at , where we started (see the machine diagram in Figure 7). Thus,
undoes what 
does. The second equation says that 
undoes what 
does.
For example, if 
, then 
and so the cancellation equations
become
These equations simply say that the cube function and the cube root function cancel
each other when applied in succession.
Now let’s see how to compute inverse functions. If we have a function 
and
are able to solve this equation for 
in terms of , then according to Deﬁnition 2 we
must have 
. If we want to call the independent variable x, we then inter-
change and and arrive at the equation

Then we solve this equation for :
Finally, we interchange and :
Therefore, the inverse function is

is on the graph of 
if and only if the point 
is on
the graph of

from 
by reﬂecting about the line
. (See Figure 8.)
Therefore, as illustrated by Figure 9:
The graph of 
is obtained by reﬂecting the graph of 
about the line

EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the graphs of

same coordinate axes.
SOLUTION First we sketch the curve 
(the top half of the parabola
, or 
) and then we reﬂect about the line 
to get the 
graph of 
. (See Figure 10.) As a check on our graph, notice that the expression
for

parabola 
and this seems reasonable from Figure 10.
Logarithmic Functions
If 
and 
, the exponential function 
is either increasing or
decreasing and so it is one-to-one by the Horizontal Line Test. It therefore has an
inverse function 
, which is called the logarithmic function with base a and is
denoted by 
. If we use the formulation of an inverse function given by (3),
then we have 
Thus, if 
, then 
is the exponent to which the base 
must be raised to give
. For example,
because

Natural Logarithms
Of all possible bases for logarithms, we will see in Chapter 3 that the most conven-
ient choice of a base is the number , which was deﬁned in Section 1.5. The logarithm
with base is called the natural logarithm and has a special notation:
If we put 
and replace 
with ln in (6) and (7), then the deﬁning properties
of the natural logarithm function become
In particular, if we set

L Notation for Logarithms
Most textbooks in calculus and the 
sciences, as well as calculators, use the
notation 
for the natural logarithm
and 
for the “common logarithm,”
. In the more advanced mathe-
matical and scientiﬁc literature and in
computer languages, however, the 
notation 
usually denotes the natural
logarithm.

EXAMPLE 7 Find if 
.
SOLUTION 1 From (8) we see that
Therefore,
.
(If you have trouble working with the “ln” notation, just replace it by 
. Then
the equation becomes 
; so, by the deﬁnition of logarithm,
.)
SOLUTION 2 Start with the equation
and apply the exponential function to both sides of the equation:
But the second cancellation equation in (9) says that 
. Therefore,
.
EXAMPLE 8 Solve the equation 
.
SOLUTION We take natural logarithms of both sides of the equation and use (9):
Since the natural logarithm is found on scientiﬁc calculators, we can approximate
the solution to four decimal places:
.
EXAMPLE 9 Express 
as a single logarithm.
SOLUTION Using Laws 3 and 1 of logarithms, we have
The following formula shows that logarithms with any base can be expressed in
terms of the natural logarithm.

Proof Let 
. Then, from (6), we have 
. Taking natural logarithms of
both sides of this equation, we get 
. Therefore
Scientiﬁc calculators have a key for natural logarithms, so Formula 10 enables 
us to use a calculator to compute a logarithm with any base (as shown in the next
example). Similarly, Formula 10 allows us to graph any logarithmic function on a
graphing calculator or computer (see Exercises 43 and 44).
EXAMPLE 10 Evaluate 
correct to six decimal places.
SOLUTION Formula 10 gives
EXAMPLE 11 In Example 3 in Section 1.5 we showed that the mass of 
that
remains from a 24-mg sample after t years is 
. Find the
inverse of this function and interpret it.
SOLUTION We need to solve the equation 
for t. We start by isolating
the exponential and taking natural logarithms of both sides:
So the inverse function is
This function gives the time required for the mass to decay to m milligrams. In par-
ticular, the time required for the mass to be reduced to 5 mg is
This answer agrees with the graphical estimate that we made in Example 3 in Sec-
tion 1.5.
The graphs of the exponential function 
and its inverse function, the natural
logarithm function, are shown in Figure 13. Because the curve 
crosses the
y-axis with a slope of 1, it follows that the reﬂected curve 
crosses the x-axis
with a slope of 1.

FIGURE 13

In common with all other logarithmic functions with base greater than 1, the natu-
ral logarithm is an increasing function deﬁned on 
and the y-axis is a vertical
asymptote. (This means that the values of 
become very large negative as 
approaches 0.)
EXAMPLE 12 Sketch the graph of the function 
.
SOLUTION We start with the graph of 
as given in Figure 13. Using the 
transformations of Section 1.3, we shift it two units to the right to get the graph 
of 
and then we shift it one unit downward to get the graph of
. (See Figure 14.)
Although 
is an increasing function, it grows very slowly when 
. In fact,
grows more slowly than any positive power of . To illustrate this fact, we 
compare approximate values of the functions 
and 
in the 
following table and we graph them in Figures 15 and 16. You can see that initially the
graphs of 
and 
grow at comparable rates, but eventually the root func-
tion far surpasses the logarithm.

Imagine that a particle moves along the curve C shown in Figure 1. It is impossible to
describe C by an equation of the form 
because C fails the Vertical Line Test.
But the x- and y-coordinates of the particle are functions of time and so we can write
and 
. Such a pair of equations is often a convenient way of describ-
ing a curve and gives rise to the following deﬁnition.
Suppose that 
and 
are both given as functions of a third variable 
(called a
parameter) by the equations
(called parametric equations). Each value of determines a point 
, which we
can plot in a coordinate plane. As varies, the point 
varies and
traces out a curve , which we call a parametric curve. The parameter t does not nec-
essarily represent time and, in fact, we could use a letter other than t for the parame-
ter. But in many applications of parametric curves, t does denote time and therefore
we can interpret 
as the position of a particle at time t.
EXAMPLE 1 Sketch and identify the curve deﬁned by the parametric equations
SOLUTION Each value of gives a point on the curve, as shown in the table. For
instance, if 
, then 
,
and so the corresponding point is 
. In
Figure 2 we plot the points 
determined by several values of the parameter and
we join them to produce a curve.

FIGURE 1

A particle whose position is given by the parametric equations moves along the
curve in the direction of the arrows as increases. Notice that the consecutive points
marked on the curve appear at equal time intervals but not at equal distances. That is
because the particle slows down and then speeds up as increases.
It appears from Figure 2 that the curve traced out by the particle may be a parab-
ola. This can be conﬁrmed by eliminating the parameter as follows. We obtain
from the second equation and substitute into the ﬁrst equation. This gives
and so the curve represented by the given parametric equations is the parabola
.
No restriction was placed on the parameter in Example 1, so we assumed that t
could be any real number. But sometimes we restrict t to lie in a ﬁnite interval. For
instance, the parametric curve
shown in Figure 3 is the part of the parabola in Example 1 that starts at the point 
and ends at the point 
. The arrowhead indicates the direction in which the curve
is traced as increases from 0 to 4.
In general, the curve with parametric equations
has initial point 
and terminal point
.
EXAMPLE 2 What curve is represented by the parametric equations

?
SOLUTION If we plot points, it appears that the curve is a circle. We can conﬁrm this
impression by eliminating 
Observe that
Thus, the point 
moves on the unit circle 
. Notice that in this
example the parameter can be interpreted as the angle (in radians) shown in Fig-
ure 4. As increases from 0 to 
, the point 
moves once
around the circle in the counterclockwise direction starting from the point 
.

so the parametric equations again represent the unit circle 
. But as 
increases from 0 to 
, the point 
starts at 
and moves
twice around the circle in the clockwise direction as indicated in Figure 5.
Examples 2 and 3 show that different sets of parametric equations can represent the
same curve. Thus, we distinguish between a curve, which is a set of points, and a
parametric curve, in which the points are traced in a particular way.

Graphing Devices
Most graphing calculators and computer graphing programs can be used to graph
curves deﬁned by parametric equations. In fact, it is instructive to watch a parametric
curve being drawn by a graphing calculator because the points are plotted in order as
the corresponding parameter values increase.
EXAMPLE 5 Use a graphing device to graph the curve 
.
SOLUTION If we let the parameter be 
, then we have the equations
Using these parametric equations to graph the curve, we obtain Figure 8. It would
be possible to solve the given equation 
for y as four functions of x
and graph them individually, but the parametric equations provide a much easier
method.
In general, if we need to graph an equation of the form 
, we can use the
parametric equations
Notice also that curves with equations 
(the ones we are most familiar with—
graphs of functions) can also be regarded as curves with parametric equations
Another use of parametric equations is to graph the inverse function of a one-to-
one function. Many graphing devices won’t plot the inverse of a given function
directly, but we can obtain the desired graph by using the parametric graphing capa-
bility of such a device. We know that the graph of the inverse function is obtained by
interchanging the - and -coordinates of the points on the graph of 
Therefore, from
(1), we see that parametric equations for the graph of 
are
EXAMPLE 6 Show that the function 
is one-to-one and graph
both 
and 
.
SOLUTION We plot the graph in Figure 9 and observe that 
is one-to-one by the 
Horizontal Line Test.
To graph 
and 
on the same screen we use parametric graphs. Parametric
equations for the graph of 
are
and parametric equations for the graph of 
are
Let’s also plot the line 
:
Figure 10 shows all three graphs and, indeed, it appears that the graph of 
is the
reﬂection of the graph of 
in the line

Graphing devices are particularly useful when sketching complicated curves. For
instance, the curves shown in Figures 11 and 12 would be virtually impossible to pro-
duce by hand.
One of the most important uses of parametric curves is in computer-aided design
(CAD). In the Laboratory Project after Section 3.5 we will investigate special para-
metric curves, called Bézier curves, that are used extensively in manufacturing, espe-
cially in the automotive industry. These curves are also employed in specifying the
shapes of letters and other symbols in laser printers.
The Cycloid
EXAMPLE 7 The curve traced out by a point 
on the circumference of a circle as 
the circle rolls along a straight line is called a cycloid (see Figure 13). If the circle
has radius and rolls along the -axis and if one position of 
is the origin, ﬁnd
parametric equations for the cycloid.
SOLUTION We choose as parameter the angle of rotation 
of the circle 
when 
is at the origin). Suppose the circle has rotated through 
radians. Because the
circle has been in contact with the line, we see from Figure 14 that the distance it
has rolled from the origin is
Therefore, the center of the circle is 
. Let the coordinates of 
be 
.
Then from Figure 14 we see that
Therefore, parametric equations of the cycloid are
One arch of the cycloid comes from one rotation of the circle and so is described by
. Although Equations 2 were derived from Figure 14, which illustrates
the case where 
, it can be seen that these equations are still valid for
other values of 
(see Exercise 31).

An animation in Module 1.7B
shows how the cycloid is formed
as the circle moves.

Although it is possible to eliminate the parameter 
from Equations 2, the result-
ing Cartesian equation in and is very complicated and not as convenient to work
with as the parametric equations.
One of the ﬁrst people to study the cycloid was Galileo, who proposed that bridges
be built in the shape of cycloids and who tried to ﬁnd the area under one arch of a
cycloid. Later this curve arose in connection with the brachistochrone problem: Find
the curve along which a particle will slide in the shortest time (under the inﬂuence of
gravity) from a point 
to a lower point 
not directly beneath . The Swiss mathe-
matician John Bernoulli, who posed this problem in 1696, showed that among all pos-
sible curves that join 
to , as in Figure 15, the particle will take the least time slid-
ing from 
to 
if the curve is part of an inverted arch of a cycloid.
The Dutch physicist Huygens had already shown that the cycloid is also the solu-
tion to the tautochrone problem; that is, no matter where a particle 
is placed on an
inverted cycloid, it takes the same time to slide to the bottom (see Figure 16). Huygens
proposed that pendulum clocks (which he invented) should swing in cycloidal arcs
because then the pendulum would take the same time to make a complete oscillation
whether it swings through a wide or a small arc.
Families of Parametric Curves
EXAMPLE 8 Investigate the family of curves with parametric equations
What do these curves have in common? How does the shape change as 
increases?
SOLUTION We use a graphing device to produce the graphs for the cases 
,
,
,
, ,
, , and 
shown in Figure 17. Notice that all of these curves
(except the case 
) have two branches, and both branches approach the vertical
asymptote 
as approaches 
from the left or right.
When 
, both branches are smooth; but when 
reaches 
, the right
branch acquires a sharp point, called a cusp. For 
between 
and 0 the cusp turns
into a loop, which becomes larger as 
approaches 0. When 
, both branches
come together and form a circle (see Example 2). For 
between 0 and 1, the left
branch has a loop, which shrinks to become a cusp when 
. For 
, the
branches become smooth again, and as increases further, they become less curved.

; Running Circles around Circles
In this project we investigate families of curves, called hypocycloids and epicycloids, that
are generated by the motion of a point on a circle that rolls inside or outside another circle.
1. A hypocycloid is a curve traced out by a ﬁxed point P on a circle C of radius b as C
rolls on the inside of a circle with center O and radius a. Show that if the initial position
of P is 
and the parameter 
is chosen as in the ﬁgure, then parametric equations of
the hypocycloid are
2. Use a graphing device (or the interactive graphic in TEC Module 1.7B) to draw the
graphs of hypocycloids with a a positive integer and b  1. How does the value of a
affect the graph? Show that if we take a  4, then the parametric equations of the
hypocycloid reduce to
This curve is called a hypocycloid of four cusps, or an astroid.
3. Now try b  1 and 
, a fraction where n and d have no common factor. First let
n  1 and try to determine graphically the effect of the denominator d on the shape of
the graph. Then let n vary while keeping d constant. What happens when

There are no hard and fast rules that will ensure success in solving problems.
However, it is possible to outline some general steps in the problem-solving process
and to give some principles that may be useful in the solution of certain problems.
These steps and principles are just common sense made explicit. They have been
adapted from George Polya’s book How To Solve It.
The ﬁrst step is to read the problem and make sure that you understand it clearly. Ask
yourself the following questions:
For many problems it is useful to
draw a diagram
and identify the given and required quantities on the diagram.
Usually it is necessary to
introduce suitable notation
In choosing symbols for the unknown quantities we often use letters such as a, b, c,
m, n, x, and y, but in some cases it helps to use initials as suggestive symbols; for
instance,
for volume or for time.
Think of a Plan
Find a connection between the given information and the unknown that will enable
you to calculate the unknown. It often helps to ask yourself explicitly: “How can I
relate the given to the unknown?” If you don’t see a connection immediately, the fol-
lowing ideas may be helpful in devising a plan.
Try to Recognize Something Familiar Relate the given situation to previous knowledge.
Look at the unknown and try to recall a more familiar problem that has a similar
unknown.
Try to Recognize Patterns Some problems are solved by recognizing that some kind of
pattern is occurring. The pattern could be geometric, or numerical, or algebraic. If you
can see regularity or repetition in a problem, you might be able to guess what the con-
tinuing pattern is and then prove it.
Use Analogy Try to think of an analogous problem, that is, a similar problem, a
related problem, but one that is easier than the original problem. If you can solve the
similar, simpler problem, then it might give you the clues you need to solve the origi-
nal, more difﬁcult problem. For instance, if a problem involves very large numbers,
you could ﬁrst try a similar problem with smaller numbers. Or if the problem involves
three-dimensional geometry, you could look for a similar problem in two-dimensional
geometry. Or if the problem you start with is a general one, you could ﬁrst try a spe-
cial case.
Introduce Something Extra It may sometimes be necessary to introduce something new,
an auxiliary aid, to help make the connection between the given and the unknown. For
instance, in a problem where a diagram is useful the auxiliary aid could be a new line
drawn in a diagram. In a more algebraic problem it could be a new unknown that is
related to the original unknown.

Principles 
of
Problem
Solving

Take Cases We may sometimes have to split a problem into several cases and give a
different argument for each of the cases. For instance, we often have to use this strat-
egy in dealing with absolute value.
Work Backward Sometimes it is useful to imagine that your problem is solved and
work backward, step by step, until you arrive at the given data. Then you may be able
to reverse your steps and thereby construct a solution to the original problem. This
procedure is commonly used in solving equations. For instance, in solving the equa-
tion 
, we suppose that 
is a number that satisﬁes 
and work
backward. We add 5 to each side of the equation and then divide each side by 3 to get
. Since each of these steps can be reversed, we have solved the problem.
Establish Subgoals In a complex problem it is often useful to set subgoals (in which the
desired situation is only partially fulﬁlled). If we can ﬁrst reach these subgoals, then
we may be able to build on them to reach our ﬁnal goal.
Indirect Reasoning Sometimes it is appropriate to attack a problem indirectly. In using
proof by contradiction to prove that 
implies 
we assume that 
is true and 
is
false and try to see why this can’t happen. Somehow we have to use this information
and arrive at a contradiction to what we absolutely know is true.
Mathematical Induction In proving statements that involve a positive integer , it is fre-
quently helpful to use the following principle.
Principle of Mathematical Induction Let 
be a statement about the positive 
integer . Suppose that
1.
is true.
2.
is true whenever 
is true.
Then 
is true for all positive integers .
This is reasonable because, since 
is true, it follows from condition 2 (with 
) that 
is true. Then, using condition 2 with 
, we see that 
is true. Again
using condition 2, this time with 
, we have that 
is true. This procedure can be
followed indeﬁnitely.
Carry Out the Plan
In Step 2 a plan was devised. In carrying out that plan we have to check each stage of
the plan and write the details that prove that each stage is correct.
Look Back
Having completed our solution, it is wise to look back over it, partly to see if we have
made errors in the solution and partly to see if we can think of an easier way to solve
the problem. Another reason for looking back is that it will familiarize us with the
method of solution and this may be useful for solving a future problem. Descartes
said, “Every problem that I solved became a rule which served afterwards to solve
other problems.”
These principles of problem solving are illustrated in the following examples.
Before you look at the solutions, try to solve these problems yourself, referring to
these Principles of Problem Solving if you get stuck. You may ﬁnd it useful to refer to
this section from time to time as you solve the exercises in the remaining chapters of
this book.

EXAMPLE 1 Express the hypotenuse 
of a right triangle with area 
as a function
of its perimeter P.
SOLUTION Let’s ﬁrst sort out the information by identifying the unknown quantity and
the data:
It helps to draw a diagram and we do so in Figure 1.
In order to connect the given quantities to the unknown, we introduce two extra
variables 
and , which are the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle. This
enables us to express the given condition, which is that the triangle is right-angled,
by the Pythagorean Theorem:
The other connections among the variables come by writing expressions for the area
and perimeter:
Since 
is given, notice that we now have three equations in the three unknowns ,
, and :
Although we have the correct number of equations, they are not easy to solve in a
straightforward fashion. But if we use the problem-solving strategy of trying to rec-
ognize something familiar, then we can solve these equations by an easier method.
Look at the right sides of Equations 1, 2, and 3. Do these expressions remind you of
anything familiar? Notice that they contain the ingredients of a familiar formula:
Using this idea, we express 
in two ways. From Equations 1 and 2 we have
From Equation 3 we have
Thus
This is the required expression for h as a function of P.

As the next example illustrates, it is often necessary to use the problem-solving
principle of taking cases when dealing with absolute values.
EXAMPLE 2 Solve the inequality 
.
SOLUTION Recall the deﬁnition of absolute value:
It follows that
Similarly
These expressions show that we must consider three cases:
CASE I
G If 
, we have
CASE II
G If 
the given inequality becomes
(always true)
CASE III
G If 
, the inequality becomes
Combining cases I, II, and III, we see that the inequality is satisﬁed when
. So the solution is the interval 
.
In the following example we ﬁrst guess the answer by looking at special cases and
recognizing a pattern. Then we prove it by mathematical induction.
In using the Principle of Mathematical Induction, we follow three steps:
STEP 1 Prove that 
is true when 
.
STEP 2 Assume that 
is true when 
and deduce that 
is true when

We notice a pattern: The coefﬁcient of x in the denominator of

In this section we see how limits arise when we attempt to ﬁnd the tangent to a curve
or the velocity of an object.
The Tangent Problem
The word tangent is derived from the Latin word tangens, which means “touching.”
Thus, a tangent to a curve is a line that touches the curve. In other words, a tangent
line should have the same direction as the curve at the point of contact. How can this
idea be made precise?
For a circle we could simply follow Euclid and say that a tangent is a line that inter-
sects the circle once and only once as in Figure 1(a). For more complicated curves this
deﬁnition is inadequate. Figure l(b) shows two lines and passing through a point 
on a curve . The line intersects 
only once, but it certainly does not look like what
we think of as a tangent. The line , on the other hand, looks like a tangent but it inter-
sects 
twice.
To be speciﬁc, let’s look at the problem of trying to ﬁnd a tangent line to the
parabola 
in the following example.
EXAMPLE 1 Find an equation of the tangent line to the parabola 
at the 
point 
.
SOLUTION We will be able to ﬁnd an equation of the tangent line as soon as we
know its slope . The difﬁculty is that we know only one point,
, on , whereas 
we need two points to compute the slope. But observe that we can compute an

In A Preview of Calculus (page 2) we saw how the
idea of a limit underlies the various branches of 
calculus. Thus, it is appropriate to begin our study of
calculus by investigating limits and their properties.
The special type of limit that is used to ﬁnd tangents 
and velocities gives rise to the central idea in differen-
tial calculus, the derivative. We see how derivatives
can be interpreted as rates of change in various situa-
tions and learn how the derivative of a function gives
information about the original function.
Locate tangents interactively and explore
them numerically.

by choosing a nearby point 
on the parabola (as in Fig-
ure 2) and computing the slope 
of the secant line

We choose 
so that 
. Then
For instance, for the point 
we have
The tables in the margin show the values of 
for several values of close to 1.
The closer 
is to , the closer is to 1 and, it appears from the tables, the closer
is to 2. This suggests that the slope of the tangent line should be 
.
We say that the slope of the tangent line is the limit of the slopes of the secant
lines, and we express this symbolically by writing
and
Assuming that the slope of the tangent line is indeed 2, we use the point-slope
form of the equation of a line (see Appendix B) to write the equation of the tangent
line through 
as

along the parabola, the corresponding secant lines rotate about 
and
approach the tangent line t.
Many functions that occur in science are not described by explicit equations; they
are deﬁned by experimental data. The next example shows how to estimate the slope
of the tangent line to the graph of such a function.
EXAMPLE 2 The ﬂash unit on a camera operates by storing charge on a capacitor 
and releasing it suddenly when the ﬂash is set off. The data at the left describe the
charge Q remaining on the capacitor (measured in microcoulombs) at time t (meas-
ured in seconds after the ﬂash goes off). Use the data to draw the graph of this 
function and estimate the slope of the tangent line at the point where t  0.04.
[Note: The slope of the tangent line represents the electric current ﬂowing from the
capacitor to the ﬂash bulb (measured in microamperes).]
SOLUTION In Figure 4 we plot the given data and use them to sketch a curve that
approximates the graph of the function.
Given the points 
and 
on the graph, we ﬁnd that
the slope of the secant line PR is
The table at the left shows the results of similar calculations for the slopes of other
secant lines. From this table we would expect the slope of the tangent line at
to lie somewhere between 742 and 607.5. In fact, the average of the
slopes of the two closest secant lines is
So, by this method, we estimate the slope of the tangent line to be 675.
Another method is to draw an approximation to the tangent line at P and measure
the sides of the triangle ABC, as in Figure 4. This gives an estimate of the slope of
the tangent line as

In Module 2.1 you can see how
the process in Figure 3 works for
ﬁve additional functions.

The Velocity Problem
If you watch the speedometer of a car as you travel in city trafﬁc, you see that the 
needle doesn’t stay still for very long; that is, the velocity of the car is not constant.
We assume from watching the speedometer that the car has a deﬁnite velocity at each
moment, but how is the “instantaneous” velocity deﬁned? Let’s investigate the example
of a falling ball.
EXAMPLE 3 Suppose that a ball is dropped from the upper observation deck of the 
CN Tower in Toronto, 450 m above the ground. Find the velocity of the ball after 
5 seconds.
SOLUTION Through experiments carried out four centuries ago, Galileo discovered that
the distance fallen by any freely falling body is proportional to the square of the
time it has been falling. (This model for free fall neglects air resistance.) If the dis-
tance fallen after seconds is denoted by 
and measured in meters, then Galileo’s
law is expressed by the equation
The difﬁculty in ﬁnding the velocity after 5 s is that we are dealing with a single
instant of time 
so no time interval is involved. However, we can approximate
the desired quantity by computing the average velocity over the brief time interval
of a tenth of a second from 
to 
:
The following table shows the results of similar calculations of the average velocity
over successively smaller time periods.
It appears that as we shorten the time period, the average velocity is becoming
closer to 49 ms. The instantaneous velocity when 
is deﬁned to be the limit-
ing value of these average velocities over shorter and shorter time periods that start
at 
. Thus, the (instantaneous) velocity after 5 s is

You may have the feeling that the calculations used in solving this problem are very
similar to those used earlier in this section to ﬁnd tangents. In fact, there is a close con-
nection between the tangent problem and the problem of ﬁnding velocities. If we draw
the graph of the distance function of the ball (as in Figure 5) and we consider the
points 
and 
on the graph, then the slope of the
secant line 
is
which is the same as the average velocity over the time interval 
. Therefore,
the velocity at time 
(the limit of these average velocities as approaches 0) must
be equal to the slope of the tangent line at (the limit of the slopes of the secant lines).
Examples 1 and 3 show that in order to solve tangent and velocity problems we
must be able to ﬁnd limits. After studying methods for computing limits in the next
four sections, we will return to the problems of ﬁnding tangents and velocities in
Section 2.6.

Let’s investigate the behavior of the function 
deﬁned by 
for
values of near 2. The following table gives values of 
for values of close to 2,
but not equal to 2.
From the table and the graph of 
(a parabola) shown in Figure 1 we see that when
is close to 2 (on either side of 2),
is close to 4. In fact, it appears that we can
make the values of 
as close as we like to 4 by taking sufﬁciently close to 2. We
express this by saying “the limit of the function 
as 
approaches
2 is equal to 4.” The notation for this is
In general, we use the following notation.
Definition We write
and say
“the limit of 
, as approaches , equals ”
if we can make the values of 
arbitrarily close to 
(as close to L as we
like) by taking x to be sufﬁciently close to 
(on either side of ) but not 
equal to .
Roughly speaking, this says that the values of 
become closer and closer to the
number 
as approaches the number 
(from either side of ) but 
.
An alternative notation for
is
as
which is usually read “
approaches 
as approaches .”
Notice the phrase “but 
” in the deﬁnition of limit. This means that in ﬁnd-
ing the limit of 
as 
approaches , we never consider

SOLUTION Notice that the function

says that we
consider values of that are close to

values of 
(correct to six decimal places) for values of that approach 1 (but are
not equal to 1). On the basis of the values in the table, we make the guess that
Example 1 is illustrated by the graph of 
in Figure 3. Now let’s change 
slightly
by giving it the value 2 when 
and calling the resulting function :
This new function still has the same limit as approaches 1 (see Figure 4).

EXAMPLE 2 Find

SOLUTION The table lists values of the function for several values of near 0.
As approaches 0, the values of the function seem to approach 
and so
we guess that
In Example 2 what would have happened if we had taken even smaller values of 
The table in the margin shows the results from one calculator; you can see that some-
thing strange seems to be happening.
If you try these calculations on your own calculator you might get different values,
but eventually you will get the value 0 if you make sufﬁciently small. Does this mean
that the answer is really 0 instead of ? No, the value of the limit is , as we will show
| in the next section. The problem is that the calculator gave false values because
is very close to 3 when is small. (In fact, when t is sufﬁciently small, a cal-
culator’s value for 
is 
to as many digits as the calculator is capable
of carrying.)
Something similar happens when we try to graph the function
of Example 2 on a graphing calculator or computer. Parts (a) and (b) of Figure 5 show
quite accurate graphs of 
and when we use the trace mode (if available), we can esti-
mate easily that the limit is about . But if we zoom in too far, as in parts (c) and (d),
then we get inaccurate graphs, again because of problems with subtraction.

SOLUTION Again the function 
is not deﬁned when 
. Using a
calculator (and remembering that, if 
,
means the sine of the angle whose
radian measure is ), we construct the following table of values correct to eight
decimal places. From the table and the graph in Figure 6 we guess that
This guess is in fact correct, as will be proved in Section 3.4 using a geometric 
argument.

is undeﬁned at 0. Evaluating the

L Computer Algebra Systems
Computer algebra systems (CAS) have
commands that compute limits. In order
to avoid the types of pitfalls demon-
strated in Examples 2, 4, and 5, they
don’t ﬁnd limits by numerical experimen-
tation. Instead, they use more sophisti-
cated techniques such as computing
inﬁnite series. If you have access to a
CAS, use the limit command to compute
the limits in the examples of this section
and to check your answers in the exer-
cises of this chapter.

The broken lines indicate that the values of 
oscillate between 1 and 
inﬁnitely often as approaches 0. (Use a graphing device to graph 
and zoom in
toward the origin several times. What do you observe?)
Since the values of 
do not approach a ﬁxed number as approaches 0,
EXAMPLE 5 Find 
.
SOLUTION As before, we construct a table of values.
From the table it appears that
But if we persevere with smaller values of , the second table suggests that
Later we will see that 
and then it follows that the limit is 0.0001.
|
Examples 4 and 5 illustrate some of the pitfalls in guessing the value of a limit. It
is easy to guess the wrong value if we use inappropriate values of , but it is difﬁcult
to know when to stop calculating values. And, as the discussion after Example 2
shows, sometimes calculators and computers give the wrong values. Later, however,
we will develop foolproof methods for calculating limits.

Module 2.2 helps you explore
limits at points where graphs
exhibit unusual behavior.

EXAMPLE 6 The Heaviside function 
is deﬁned by
[This function is named after the electrical engineer Oliver Heaviside (1850–1925)
and can be used to describe an electric current that is switched on at time 
.] Its
graph is shown in Figure 8.
As approaches 0 from the left,
approaches 0. As approaches 0 from the
right,
approaches 1. There is no single number that 
approaches as
approaches 0. Therefore,
does not exist.
One-Sided Limits
We noticed in Example 6 that 
approaches 0 as approaches 0 from the left and
approaches 1 as approaches 0 from the right. We indicate this situation sym-
bolically by writing
and
The symbol “
” indicates that we consider only values of that are less than 0.
Likewise, “
” indicates that we consider only values of that are greater than 0.
Definition We write
and say the left-hand limit of 
as 
approaches 
[or the limit of 
as
approaches 
from the left] is equal to 
if we can make the values of 
as close to L as we like by taking x to be sufﬁciently close to a and x less than a.
Notice that Deﬁnition 2 differs from Deﬁnition 1 only in that we require 
to be
less than . Similarly, if we require that 
be greater than , we get “the right-hand
limit of 
as
approaches 
is equal to ” and we write
Thus, the symbol “
” means that we consider only 
. These deﬁnitions are
illustrated in Figure 9.

At the beginning of this section we considered the function 
and, based on numerical and graphical evidence, we saw that
According to Deﬁnition 1, this means that the values of 
can be made as close to
4 as we like, provided that we take sufﬁciently close to 2. In the following example
we use graphical methods to determine just how close is sufﬁciently close.
EXAMPLE 9 If 
, how close to 2 does have to be to ensure that
is within a distance 0.1 of the number 4?
SOLUTION If the distance from 
to 4 is less than 0.1, then 
lies between 3.9 and
4.1, so the requirement is that
Thus, we need to determine the values of such that the curve 
lies
between the horizontal lines 
and 
. We graph the curve and lines near
the point 
in Figure 12. With the cursor, we estimate that the -coordinate of
the point of intersection of the line 
and the curve 
is about
1.966. Similarly, the curve intersects the line 
when 
. So, rounding
to be safe, we conclude that
when
Therefore,
is within a distance 0.1 of 4 when is within a distance 0.03
of 2.
The idea behind Example 9 can be used to formulate the precise deﬁnition of a
limit that is discussed in Appendix D.

CHAPTER 2 LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES

These ﬁve laws can be stated verbally as follows:
Sum Law
1. The limit of a sum is the sum of the limits.
Difference Law
2. The limit of a difference is the difference of the limits.
Constant Multiple Law
3. The limit of a constant times a function is the constant times the limit of the 
function.
Product Law
4. The limit of a product is the product of the limits.
Quotient Law
5. The limit of a quotient is the quotient of the limits (provided that the limit of
the denominator is not 0).
It is easy to believe that these properties are true. For instance, if 
is close to 
and 
is close to 
, it is reasonable to conclude that 
is close to 
.
This gives us an intuitive basis for believing that Law 1 is true. All of these laws can
be proved using the precise deﬁnition of a limit. In Appendix E we give the proof of
Law 1.
EXAMPLE 1 Use the Limit Laws and the graphs of 
and t in Figure 1 to evaluate the
following limits, if they exist.

SOLUTION
(a) From the graphs of 
and t we see that
Therefore, we have

(by Law 3)
(b) We see that 
. But 
does not exist because the left and
right limits are different:
So we can’t use Law 4. The given limit does not exist since the left limit is not equal
to the right limit.
(c) The graphs show that
Because the limit of the denominator is 0, we can’t use Law 5. The given limit does
not exist because the denominator approaches 0 while the numerator approaches a
nonzero number.

. In other words, we would
have gotten the correct answer in Example 2(a) by substituting 5 for x. Similarly,
direct substitution provides the correct answer in part (b). The functions in Example
2 are a polynomial and a rational function, respectively, and similar use of the Limit
Laws proves that direct substitution always works for such functions (see Exercises 39
and 40). We state this fact as follows.
Direct Substitution Property If 
is a polynomial or a rational function and 
is in
the domain of , then
Functions with the Direct Substitution Property are called continuous at a and will
be studied in Section 2.4. However, not all limits can be evaluated by direct substitu-
tion, as the following examples show.
EXAMPLE 3 Find 
.
SOLUTION Let 
. We can’t ﬁnd the limit by substituting 
because 
isn’t deﬁned. Nor can we apply the Quotient Law because the limit of
the denominator is 0. Instead, we need to do some preliminary algebra. We factor
the numerator as a difference of squares:
The numerator and denominator have a common factor of 
. When we take the
limit as approaches 1, we have 
and so 
. Therefore, we can cancel
the common factor and compute the limit as follows:

L Newton and Limits
Isaac Newton was born on Christmas
Day in 1642, the year of Galileo’s
death. When he entered Cambridge 
University in 1661 Newton didn’t know
much mathematics, but he learned
quickly by reading Euclid and Descartes
and by attending the lectures of Isaac
Barrow. Cambridge was closed because
of the plague in 1665 and 1666, and
Newton returned home to reﬂect on what
he had learned. Those two years were
amazingly productive for at that time he
made four of his major discoveries:
(1) his representation of functions as sums
of inﬁnite series, including the binomial
theorem; (2) his work on differential and
integral calculus; (3) his laws of motion
and law of universal gravitation; and 
(4) his prism experiments on the nature of
light and color. Because of a fear of con-
troversy and criticism, he was reluctant to
publish his discoveries and it wasn’t until
1687, at the urging of the astronomer
Halley, that Newton published Principia
Mathematica. In this work, the greatest
scientiﬁc treatise ever written, Newton set
forth his version of calculus and used it to
investigate mechanics, ﬂuid dynamics,
and wave motion, and to explain the
motion of planets and comets.
The beginnings of calculus are found
in the calculations of areas and volumes
by ancient Greek scholars such as
Eudoxus and Archimedes. Although
aspects of the idea of a limit are implicit
in their “method of exhaustion,” Eudoxus
and Archimedes never explicitly formu-
lated the concept of a limit. Likewise,
mathematicians such as Cavalieri, 
Fermat, and Barrow, the immediate 
precursors of Newton in the development
of calculus, did not actually use limits. It
was Isaac Newton who was the ﬁrst to
talk explicitly about limits. He explained
that the main idea behind limits is that
quantities “approach nearer than by any
given difference.” Newton stated that the
limit was the basic concept in calculus,
but it was left to later mathematicians like
Cauchy to clarify his ideas about limits.

The limit in this example arose in Section 2.1 when we were trying to ﬁnd the tan-
gent to the parabola 
at the point 
.
EXAMPLE 4 Find 
where 
SOLUTION Here is deﬁned at 
and 
, but the value of a limit as 
approaches 1 does not depend on the value of the function at 1. Since 
for 
, we have
Note that the values of the functions in Examples 3 and 4 are identical except when
(see Figure 2) and so they have the same limit as approaches 1.
EXAMPLE 5 Evaluate

SOLUTION If we deﬁne 
then, as in Example 3, we can’t compute 
by letting 
since 
is
undeﬁned. But if we simplify 
algebraically, we ﬁnd that
(Recall that we consider only 
when letting 
approach 0.) Thus
EXAMPLE 6 Find 
.
SOLUTION We can’t apply the Quotient Law immediately, since the limit of the denomi-
nator is 0. Here the preliminary algebra consists of rationalizing the numerator:
This calculation conﬁrms the guess that we made in Example 2 in Section 2.2.

Some limits are best calculated by ﬁrst ﬁnding the left- and right-hand limits. The
following theorem is a reminder of what we discovered in Section 2.2. It says that a
two-sided limit exists if and only if both of the one-sided limits exist and are equal.

When computing one-sided limits we use the fact that the Limit Laws also hold for
one-sided limits.

We noticed in Section 2.3 that the limit of a function as 
approaches 
can often 
be found simply by calculating the value of the function at . Functions with this 
property are called continuous at a. We will see that the mathematical deﬁnition of
continuity corresponds closely with the meaning of the word continuity in everyday
language. (A continuous process is one that takes place gradually, without interrup-
tion or abrupt change.)
Definition A function 
is continuous at a number a if
If 
is not continuous at a, we say 
is discontinuous at a, or 
has a discontinuity
at a. Notice that Deﬁnition l implicitly requires three things if 
is continuous at a:
1.
is deﬁned (that is, a is in the domain of )
2.
exists
3.
The deﬁnition says that is continuous at if 
approaches 
as x approaches
a. Thus, a continuous function 
has the property that a small change in x produces
only a small change in 
. In fact, the change in 
can be kept as small as we
please by keeping the change in sufﬁciently small.
Physical phenomena are usually continuous. For instance, the displacement or
velocity of a vehicle varies continuously with time, as does a person’s height. But dis-
continuities do occur in such situations as electric currents. [See Example 6 in Sec-
tion 2.2, where the Heaviside function is discontinuous at because 
does
not exist.]
Geometrically, you can think of a function that is continuous at every number in an
interval as a function whose graph has no break in it. The graph can be drawn with-
out removing your pen from the paper.

EXAMPLE 1 Figure 2 shows the graph of a function . At which numbers is 
discon-
tinuous? Why?
SOLUTION It looks as if there is a discontinuity when 
because the graph has a
break there. The ofﬁcial reason that 
is discontinuous at 1 is that 
is not deﬁned.
The graph also has a break when a  3, but the reason for the discontinuity is
different. Here,
is deﬁned, but 
does not exist (because the left and
right limits are different). So 
is discontinuous at 3.
What about 
? Here,
is deﬁned and 
exists (because the left
and right limits are the same). But
So 
is discontinuous at 5.
Now let’s see how to detect discontinuities when a function is deﬁned by a formula.
EXAMPLE 2 Where are each of the following functions discontinuous?
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)
SOLUTION
(a) Notice that 
is not deﬁned, so 
is discontinuous at 2.
(b) Here 
is deﬁned but
does not exist. (See Example 8 in Section 2.2.) So 
is discontinuous at 0.
(c) Here 
is deﬁned and
exists. But 
so 
is not continuous at 2.
(d) The greatest integer function 
has discontinuities at all of the integers
because 
does not exist if 
is an integer. (See Example 9 and Exercise 35
in Section 2.3.)
Figure 3 shows the graphs of the functions in Example 2. In each case the graph
can’t be drawn without lifting the pen from the paper because a hole or break or jump
occurs in the graph. The kind of discontinuity illustrated in parts (a) and (c) is called
removable because we could remove the discontinuity by redeﬁning 
at just the

discontinuities because the function “jumps” from one value to another.

Instead of always using Deﬁnitions 1, 2, and 3 to verify the continuity of a func-

shows how to build up complicated continuous functions from simple ones.

This shows that

It follows from Theorem 4 and Deﬁnition 3 that if

continuous on its domain.

Proof
(a) A polynomial is a function of the form
where 
are constants. We know that
(by Law 7)
and
(by 9)
This equation is precisely the statement that the function 
is a continuous 
function. Thus, by part 3 of Theorem 4, the function 
is continuous.
Since 
is a sum of functions of this form and a constant function, it follows from
part 1 of Theorem 4 that 
is continuous.
(b) A rational function is a function of the form
where 
and 
are polynomials. The domain of 
is 
. We
know from part (a) that 
and 
are continuous everywhere. Thus, by part 5 of
Theorem 4,
is continuous at every number in .
As an illustration of Theorem 5, observe that the volume of a sphere varies contin-
uously with its radius because the formula 
shows that 
is a polynomial
function of . Likewise, if a ball is thrown vertically into the air with a velocity of
50 fts, then the height of the ball in feet after 
seconds is given by the formula
. Again this is a polynomial function, so the height is a continuous
function of the elapsed time.
Knowledge of which functions are continuous enables us to evaluate some limits
very quickly, as the following example shows. Compare it with Example 2(b) in Sec-
tion 2.3.
EXAMPLE 5 Find 
.
SOLUTION The function
is rational, so by Theorem 5 it is continuous on its domain, which is 
. 
Therefore
It turns out that most of the familiar functions are continuous at every number in
their domains. For instance, Limit Law 10 (page 112) is exactly the statement that root
functions are continuous.

From the appearance of the graphs of the sine and cosine functions (Figure 18 in
Section 1.2), we would certainly guess that they are continuous. We know from the
deﬁnitions of 
and 
that the coordinates of the point P in Figure 5 are
. As 
, we see that P approaches the point 
and so 
and 
. Thus
Since 
and 
, the equations in (6) assert that the cosine and sine
functions are continuous at 0. The addition formulas for cosine and sine can then be
used to deduce that these functions are continuous everywhere (see Exercises 43 and 44).
It follows from part 5 of Theorem 4 that
is continuous except where cos x  0. This happens when x is an odd integer mul-
tiple of 
, so y  tan x has inﬁnite discontinuities when 
,
and so on (see Figure 6).
The inverse function of any continuous function is also continuous. (The graph of
is obtained by reﬂecting the graph of f about the line 
. So if the graph of f
has no break in it, neither does the graph of 
.) Thus, the inverse trigonometric func-
tions are continuous.
In Section 1.5 we deﬁned the exponential function 
so as to ﬁll in the holes
in the graph of 
where x is rational. In other words, the very deﬁnition of 
makes it a continuous function on . Therefore, its inverse function 
is con-
tinuous on

SOLUTION We know from Theorem 7 that the function 
is continuous for
and 
is continuous on . Thus, by part 1 of Theorem 4,
is continuous on 
. The denominator,
, is a poly-
nomial, so it is continuous everywhere. Therefore, by part 5 of Theorem 4,
is con-
tinuous at all positive numbers x except where 
. So 
is continuous on
the intervals 
and 
.
EXAMPLE 7 Evaluate 
.
SOLUTION Theorem 7 tells us that 
is continuous. The function in the denom-
inator,
, is the sum of two continuous functions and is therefore con-
tinuous. Notice that this function is never 0 because 
for all and so
everywhere. Thus, the ratio
is continuous everywhere. Hence, by deﬁnition of a continuous function,
Another way of combining continuous functions 
and to get a new continuous
function is to form the composite function 
. This fact is a consequence of the fol-
lowing theorem.
Theorem If

and 
then 
In other words,
Intuitively, this theorem is reasonable because if 
is close to , then 
is close

L This theorem says that a limit symbol
can be moved through a function symbol
if the function is continuous and the limit
exists. In other words, the order of these
two symbols can be reversed.

Theorem If is continuous at 
and 
is continuous at 
, then the com-
posite function 
given by 
is continuous at .
This theorem is often expressed informally by saying “a continuous function of a
continuous function is a continuous function.”
Proof Since is continuous at , we have
Since 
is continuous at 
, we can apply Theorem 8 to obtain
which is precisely the statement that the function 
is continuous at ;
that is,
is continuous at .
EXAMPLE 9 Where are the following functions continuous?
(a)
(b)
SOLUTION
(a) We have 
, where
Now is continuous on 
since it is a polynomial, and 
is also continuous every-
where. Thus,
is continuous on 
by Theorem 9.
(b) We know from Theorem 7 that 
is continuous and 
is continuous (because both 
and 
are continuous). Therefore, by
Theorem 9,
is continuous wherever it is deﬁned. Now 
is deﬁned when 
. So it is undeﬁned when 
, and this hap-
pens when 
. Thus, F has discontinuities when x is an odd mul-
tiple of 
and is continuous on the intervals between these values (see Figure 7).
An important property of continuous functions is expressed by the following theo-
rem, whose proof is found in more advanced books on calculus.
The Intermediate Value Theorem Suppose that 
is continuous on the closed
interval 
and let 
be any number between 
and 
. Then there
exists a number in 
such that 
.
The Intermediate Value Theorem states that a continuous function takes on every
intermediate value between the function values 
and 
. It is illustrated by
Figure 8. Note that the value 
can be taken on once [as in part (a)] or more than once
[as in part (b)].

If we think of a continuous function as a function whose graph has no hole or
break, then it is easy to believe that the Intermediate Value Theorem is true. In geo-
metric terms it says that if any horizontal line 
is given between 
and
as in Figure 9, then the graph of 
can’t jump over the line. It must intersect
somewhere.
It is important that the function 
in Theorem 10 be continuous. The Intermediate
Value Theorem is not true in general for discontinuous functions (see Exercise 32).
One use of the Intermediate Value Theorem is in locating roots of equations as in
the following example.
EXAMPLE 10 Show that there is a root of the equation
between 1 and 2.
SOLUTION Let 
. We are looking for a solution of the given
equation, that is, a number between 1 and 2 such that 
. Therefore, we take
,
, and 
in Theorem 10. We have
and
Thus 
, that is,
is a number between 
and 
. Now 
is
continuous since it is a polynomial, so the Intermediate Value Theorem says there 
is a number between 1 and 2 such that 
. In other words, the equation
has at least one root in the interval 
.
In fact, we can locate a root more precisely by using the Intermediate Value 
Theorem again. Since
a root must lie between 1.2 and 1.3. A calculator gives, by trial and error,
so a root lies in the interval 
.

We can use a graphing calculator or computer to illustrate the use of the Interme-
diate Value Theorem in Example 10. Figure 10 shows the graph of 
in the viewing
rectangle 
by 
and you can see the graph crossing the -axis between 
1 and 2. Figure 11 shows the result of zooming in to the viewing rectangle 
by 
.
In fact, the Intermediate Value Theorem plays a role in the very way these graph-
ing devices work. A computer calculates a ﬁnite number of points on the graph and
turns on the pixels that contain these calculated points. It assumes that the function is
continuous and takes on all the intermediate values between two consecutive points.
The computer therefore connects the pixels by turning on the intermediate pixels.

To indicate this kind of behavior we use the notation
| This does not mean that we are regarding 
as a number. Nor does it mean that the
limit exists. It simply expresses the particular way in which the limit does not exist:
can be made as large as we like by taking close enough to 0.
In general, we write symbolically
to indicate that the values of 
become larger and larger (or “increase without
bound”) as approaches .
Definition The notation
means that the values of 
can be made arbitrarily large (as large as we
please) by taking sufﬁciently close to (on either side of ) but not equal to .
Another notation for 
is
as
Again, the symbol 
is not a number, but the expression 
is often read
as
“the limit of 
, as approaches , is inﬁnity”
or
“
becomes inﬁnite as approaches ”
or
“
increases without bound as approaches ”
This deﬁnition is illustrated graphically in Figure 2.
Similarly, as shown in Figure 3,
means that the values of 
are as large negative as we like for all values of 
that
are sufﬁciently close to , but not equal to .
The symbol 
can be read as “the limit of 
, as 
approaches
, is negative inﬁnity” or “
decreases without bound as 
approaches .” As an
example we have
Similar deﬁnitions can be given for the one-sided inﬁnite limits

four cases are given in Figure 4.
Definition The line 
is called a vertical asymptote of the curve
if at least one of the following statements is true:
For instance, the -axis is a vertical asymptote of the curve 
because

SOLUTION If is close to 3 but larger than 3, then the denominator 
is a small
positive number and 
is close to 6. So the quotient 
is a large positive
number. Thus, intuitively we see that
Likewise, if is close to 3 but smaller than 3, then 
is a small negative number
but 
is still a positive number (close to 6). So 
is a numerically large
negative number. Thus
The graph of the curve 
is given in Figure 5. The line 
is a
vertical asymptote.
Two familiar functions whose graphs have vertical asymptotes are

As 
grows larger and larger you can see that the values of 
get closer and
closer to 1. In fact, it seems that we can make the values of 
as close as we like to
1 by taking 
sufﬁciently large. This situation is expressed symbolically by writing
In general, we use the notation
to indicate that the values of 
approach 
as becomes larger and larger.
Definition Let 
be a function deﬁned on some interval 
. Then
means that the values of 
can be made as close to 
as we like by taking 
sufﬁciently large.
Another notation for

as
The symbol 
does not represent a number. Nonetheless, the expression

“the limit of 
, as approaches inﬁnity, is ”
or
“the limit of 
, as becomes inﬁnite, is ”
or
“the limit of 
, as increases without bound, is ”
The meaning of such phrases is given by Deﬁnition 4.
Geometric illustrations of Deﬁnition 4 are shown in Figure 9. Notice that there are
many ways for the graph of 
to approach the line 
(which is called a horizon-
tal asymptote).
Referring back to Figure 8, we see that for numerically large negative values of ,
the values of

out bound, we can make 
as close to 1 as we like. This is expressed by writing
In general, as shown in Figure 10, the notation
means that the values of 
can be made arbitrarily close to by taking sufﬁciently
large negative.
Again, the symbol 
does not represent a number, but the expression
is often read as
“the limit of 
, as x approaches negative inﬁnity, is L”
Definition The line 
is called a horizontal asymptote of the curve
if either 
For instance, the curve illustrated in Figure 8 has the line 
as a horizontal
asymptote because 
An example of a curve with two horizontal asymptotes is 
. (See Figure 11.)
In fact,
so both of the lines 
and 
are horizontal asymptotes. (This follows
from the fact that the lines 
are vertical asymptotes of the graph of tan.)
EXAMPLE 3 Find the inﬁnite limits, limits at inﬁnity, and asymptotes for the function
whose graph is shown in Figure 12.
SOLUTION We see that the values of 
become large as 
from both sides, so
Notice that 
becomes large negative as x approaches 2 from the left, but large
positive as x approaches 2 from the right. So
Thus, both of the lines

As x becomes large, we see that 
approaches 4. But as x decreases through
negative values,
approaches 2. So
This means that both 
and 
are horizontal asymptotes.
EXAMPLE 4 Find 
and 
.
SOLUTION Observe that when is large,
is small. For instance,
In fact, by taking large enough, we can make 
as close to 0 as we please.
Therefore, according to Deﬁnition 4, we have 
Similar reasoning shows that when is large negative,
is small negative, so we
also have
It follows that the line 
(the -axis) is a horizontal asymptote of the curve
. (This is an equilateral hyperbola; see Figure 13.)
Most of the Limit Laws that were given in Section 2.3 also hold for limits at inﬁn-
ity. It can be proved that the Limit Laws listed in Section 2.3 (with the exception of
Laws 9 and 10) are also valid if “
” is replaced by “
” or “
.” In
particular, if we combine Law 6 with the results of Example 4 we obtain the follow-
ing important rule for calculating limits.
If is a positive integer, then
EXAMPLE 5 Evaluate
SOLUTION To evaluate the limit at inﬁnity of a rational function, we ﬁrst divide both
the numerator and denominator by the highest power of that occurs in the denomi-
nator. (We may assume that

In this case the highest power of is

A similar calculation shows that the limit as 
is also . Figure 14 illustrates
the results of these calculations by showing how the graph of the given rational
function approaches the horizontal asymptote

EXAMPLE 6 Compute

SOLUTION We ﬁrst multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate radical:
The Squeeze Theorem could be used to show that this limit is 0. But an easier
method is to divide numerator and denominator by . Doing this and remembering
that

Figure 15 illustrates this result.

The graph of the natural exponential function 
has the line y  0 (the x-axis)
as a horizontal asymptote. (The same is true of any exponential function with base

see that
Notice that the values of 
approach 0 very rapidly.

In Section 2.1 we guessed the values of slopes of tangent lines and velocities on the
basis of numerical evidence. Now that we have deﬁned limits and have learned tech-
niques for computing them, we return to the tangent and velocity problems with the
ability to calculate slopes of tangents, velocities, and other rates of change.
Tangents
If a curve 
has equation 
and we want to ﬁnd the tangent to 
at the point
, then we consider a nearby point 
, where 
, and compute the
slope of the secant line 
:
Then we let 
approach 
along the curve 
by letting 
approach . If 
approaches a number 
, then we deﬁne the tangent t to be the line through 
with
slope . (This amounts to saying that the tangent line is the limiting position of the
secant line 
as 
approaches . See Figure 1.)
Definition The tangent line to the curve 
at the point 
is
the line through 
with slope
provided that this limit exists.

In our ﬁrst example we conﬁrm the guess we made in Example 1 in Section 2.1.
EXAMPLE 1 Find an equation of the tangent line to the parabola 
at the 
point 
.
SOLUTION Here we have 
and 
, so the slope is
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we ﬁnd that an equation of the
tangent line at 
is
We sometimes refer to the slope of the tangent line to a curve at a point as the slope
of the curve at the point. The idea is that if we zoom in far enough toward the point,
the curve looks almost like a straight line. Figure 2 illustrates this procedure for 
the curve 
in Example 1. The more we zoom in, the more the parabola looks
like a line. In other words, the curve becomes almost indistinguishable from its tan-
gent line.
There is another expression for the slope of a tangent line that is sometimes easier
to use. Let
Then
so the slope of the secant line 
is

The hyperbola and its tangent are shown in Figure 4.
Velocities
In Section 2.1 we investigated the motion of a ball dropped from the CN Tower and
deﬁned its velocity to be the limiting value of average velocities over shorter and
shorter time periods.
In general, suppose an object moves along a straight line according to an equation
of motion 
, where is the displacement (directed distance) of the object from
the origin at time . The function 
that describes the motion is called the position

function of the object. In the time interval from 
to 
the change in
position is 
. (See Figure 5.) The average velocity over this time inter-
val is
which is the same as the slope of the secant line 
in Figure 6.
Now suppose we compute the average velocities over shorter and shorter time
intervals 
. In other words, we let 
approach . As in the example of the
falling ball, we deﬁne the velocity (or instantaneous velocity) 
at time 
to
be the limit of these average velocities:
This means that the velocity at time 
is equal to the slope of the tangent line at
(compare Equations 2 and 3).
Now that we know how to compute limits, let’s reconsider the problem of the fall-
ing ball.
EXAMPLE 3 Suppose that a ball is dropped from the upper observation deck of the 
CN Tower, 450 m above the ground.
(a) What is the velocity of the ball after 5 seconds?
(b) How fast is the ball traveling when it hits the ground?
SOLUTION We ﬁrst use the equation of motion 
to ﬁnd the velocity
after seconds:
(a) The velocity after 5 s is 
ms.
(b) Since the observation deck is 450 m above the ground, the ball will hit the
ground at the time 
when 
, that is,
This gives
The velocity of the ball as it hits the ground is therefore

Other Rates of Change

increment of ) is
and the corresponding change in is
The difference quotient
is called the average rate of change of y with respect to x over the interval 
and can be interpreted as the slope of the secant line 
in Figure 7.
By analogy with velocity, we consider the average rate of change over smaller and
smaller intervals by letting 
approach 
and therefore letting 
approach . The
limit of these average rates of change is called the (instantaneous) rate of change of
y with respect to x at 
, which is interpreted as the slope of the tangent to the
curve 
at

EXAMPLE 4 Temperature readings 
(in degrees Celsius) were recorded every hour
starting at midnight on a day in April in Whiteﬁsh, Montana. The time is measured
in hours from midnight. The data are given in the table at the left.

(i) from noon to 3 P.M.
(ii) from noon to 2 P.M.
(iii) from noon to 1 P.M.
(b) Estimate the instantaneous rate of change at noon.
SOLUTION
(a)
(i) From noon to 3 P.M. the temperature changes from 14.3 °C to 18.2 °C, so
while the change in time is 
h. Therefore, the average rate of change
of temperature with respect to time is

The units for the average rate of change
are the units for 
divided by
the units for 
, namely, degrees Celsius
per hour. The instantaneous rate of
change is the limit of the average rates
of change, so it is measured in the same
units: degrees Celsius per hour.

(b) We plot the given data in Figure 8 and use them to sketch a smooth curve that
approximates the graph of the temperature function. Then we draw the tangent at the
point 
where 
and, after measuring the sides of triangle 
, we estimate
that the slope of the tangent line is
Therefore, the instantaneous rate of change of temperature with respect to time at
noon is about 1.9 °Ch.
The velocity of a particle is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time.
Physicists are interested in other rates of change as well—for instance, the rate of
change of work with respect to time (which is called power). Chemists who study a
chemical reaction are interested in the rate of change in the concentration of a reac-
tant with respect to time (called the rate of reaction). A steel manufacturer is inter-
ested in the rate of change of the cost of producing tons of steel per day with respect
to 
(called the marginal cost). A biologist is interested in the rate of change of the
population of a colony of bacteria with respect to time. In fact, the computation of
rates of change is important in all of the natural sciences, in engineering, and even in
the social sciences. Further examples will be given in Section 3.3.
All these rates of change can be interpreted as slopes of tangents. This gives added
signiﬁcance to the solution of the tangent problem. Whenever we solve a problem
involving tangent lines, we are not just solving a problem in geometry. We are also
implicitly solving a great variety of problems involving rates of change in science and
engineering.

14. Valerie is driving along a highway. Sketch the graph of the
position function of her car if she drives in the following
manner: At time t  0, the car is at mile marker 15 and is
traveling at a constant speed of 55 mih. She travels at this
speed for exactly an hour. Then the car slows gradually over
a 2-minute period as Valerie comes to a stop for dinner.

speeding up to 65 mih over a 2-minute period. She drives
at a constant 65 mih for two hours and then over a 
3-minute period gradually slows to a complete stop.

Interpretation of the Derivative as the Slope of a Tangent
In Section 2.6 we deﬁned the tangent line to the curve 
at the point 
to be the line that passes through 
and has slope 
given by Equation 1. Since, by
Deﬁnition 2, this is the same as the derivative 
, we can now say the following.
The tangent line to 
at 
is the line through 
whose
slope is equal to 
, the derivative of 
at .
Thus, the geometric interpretation of a derivative [as deﬁned by either (2) or (3)] is as
shown in Figure 1.
If we use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we can write an equation
of the tangent line to the curve 
at the point 
:
EXAMPLE 2 Find an equation of the tangent line to the parabola

Since we are not yet able to evaluate this limit exactly, we use a calculator to
approximate the values of

approaches , these values appear to approach a number
near 0.69. So our estimate is
(b) In Figure 3 we graph the curve 
and zoom in toward the point 
. We
see that the closer we get to 
, the more the curve looks like a straight line. In
fact, in Figure 3(c) the curve is practically indistinguishable from its tangent line at
. Since the -scale and the -scale are both 0.01, we estimate that the slope of
this line is
So our estimate of the derivative is 
. In Section 3.5 we will show that,
correct to six decimal places,

From Equation 3 we recognize this limit as being the derivative of 
at 
, that is,
. This gives a second interpretation of the derivative:
The derivative 
is the instantaneous rate of change of 
with
respect to 
when 
.
The connection with the ﬁrst interpretation is that if we sketch the curve 
,
then the instantaneous rate of change is the slope of the tangent to this curve at the
point where 
. This means that when the derivative is large (and therefore the
curve is steep, as at the point 
in Figure 4), the -values change rapidly. When 
the derivative is small, the curve is relatively ﬂat and the -values change slowly.
In particular, if 
is the position function of a particle that moves along 
a straight line, then 
is the rate of change of the displacement with respect to 
the time . In other words,
is the velocity of the particle at time 
(see Sec-
tion 2.6). The speed of the particle is the absolute value of the velocity, that is,
EXAMPLE 4 The position of a particle is given by the equation of motion
, where is measured in seconds and in meters. Find the
velocity and the speed after 2 seconds.
SOLUTION The derivative of

Thus, the velocity after 2 seconds is

In Module 2.7 you are asked to
compare and order the slopes of
tangent and secant lines at several points
on a curve.

SOLUTION
(a) The derivative 
is the instantaneous rate of change of C with respect to x;
that is,
means the rate of change of the production cost with respect to the
number of yards produced. (Economists call this rate of change the marginal cost.
This idea is discussed in more detail in Sections 3.3 and 4.7.)
Because
the units for 
are the same as the units for the difference quotient 
. Since 
is measured in dollars and 
in yards, it follows that the units for 
are
dollars per yard.
(b) The statement that 
means that, after 1000 yards of fabric have
been manufactured, the rate at which the production cost is increasing is $9yard.
(When 
, C is increasing 9 times as fast as x.)
Since 
is small compared with x  1000, we could use the approximation
and say that the cost of manufacturing the 1000th yard (or the 1001st) is about $9.
(c) The rate at which the production cost is increasing (per yard) is probably lower
when x  500 than when x  50 (the cost of making the 500th yard is less than the
cost of the 50th yard) because of economies of scale. (The manufacturer makes
more efﬁcient use of the ﬁxed costs of production.) So
But, as production expands, the resulting large-scale operation might become 
inefﬁcient and there might be overtime costs. Thus, it is possible that the rate of
increase of costs will eventually start to rise. So it may happen that
The following example shows how to estimate the derivative of a tabular function,
that is, a function deﬁned not by a formula but by a table of values.
EXAMPLE 6 Let 
be the population of the United States at time t. The table at the
left gives approximate values of this function by providing midyear population esti-
mates from 1992 to 2000. Interpret and estimate the value of 
.
SOLUTION The derivative 
means the rate of change of P with respect to t
when 
, that is, the rate of increase of the population in 1996.
According to Equation 3,
So we compute and tabulate values of the difference quotient (the average rates of
change) as follows.

Early Methods for Finding Tangents
The ﬁrst person to formulate explicitly the ideas of limits and derivatives was Sir Isaac
Newton in the 1660s. But Newton acknowledged that “if I have seen farther than other 
men, it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants.” Two of those giants were Pierre
Fermat (1601–1665) and Newton’s teacher at Cambridge, Isaac Barrow (1630–1677). 
Newton was familiar with the methods that these men used to ﬁnd tangent lines, and their
methods played a role in Newton’s eventual formulation of calculus.
The following references contain explanations of these methods. Read one or more 
of the references and write a report comparing the methods of either Fermat or Barrow to
modern methods. In particular, use the method of Section 2.7 to ﬁnd an equation of the
tangent line to the curve 
at the point (1, 3) and show how either Fermat or
Barrow would have solved the same problem. Although you used derivatives and they did
not, point out similarities between the methods.

In the preceding section we considered the derivative of a function f at a ﬁxed num-
ber a:
Here we change our point of view and let the number a vary. If we replace a in Equa-
tion 1 by a variable x, we obtain
Given any number x for which this limit exists, we assign to x the number 
. 
So we can regard 
as a new function, called the derivative of and deﬁned by Equa-
tion 2. We know that the value of 
at ,
, can be interpreted geometrically as the
slope of the tangent line to the graph of 
at the point 
.
The function 
is called the derivative of 
because it has been “derived” from 
by the limiting operation in Equation 2. The domain of

EXAMPLE 1 The graph of a function 
is given in Figure 1. Use it to sketch the graph
of the derivative 
.
SOLUTION We can estimate the value of the derivative at any value of by drawing 
the tangent at the point 
and estimating its slope. For instance, for x  5 
we draw the tangent at 
in Figure 2(a) and estimate its slope to be about , so
. This allows us to plot the point 
on the graph of 
directly
beneath P. Repeating this procedure at several points, we get the graph shown in
Figure 2(b). Notice that the tangents at ,
, and 
are horizontal, so the derivative
is 0 there and the graph of 
crosses the -axis at the points 
,
, and 
, directly
beneath A, B, and C. Between 
and 
the tangents have positive slope, so 
is
positive there. But between 
and 
the tangents have negative slope, so 
is
negative there.
If a function is deﬁned by a table of values, then we can construct a table of approx-
imate values of its derivative, as in the next example.

EXAMPLE 2 Let 
be the population of Belgium at time . The table at the left gives
midyear values of 
, in thousands, from 1980 to 2000. Construct a table of values
for the derivative of this function.
SOLUTION We assume that there were no wild ﬂuctuations in the population between
the stated values. Let’s start by approximating 
, the rate of increase of the
population of Belgium in mid-1988. Since
we have
for small values of .
For 
, we get
(This is the average rate of increase between 1988 and 1990.) For 
, we have
which is the average rate of increase between 1986 and 1988. We get a more accu-
rate approximation if we take the average of these rates of change:
This means that in 1988 the population was increasing at a rate of about 25,000
people per year.
Making similar calculations for the other values (except at the endpoints), we get
the table of approximate values for the derivative.

EXAMPLE 3
(a) If 
, ﬁnd a formula for

(b) Illustrate by comparing the graphs of f and 
.
SOLUTION
(a) When using Equation 2 to compute a derivative, we must remember that the
variable is h and that x is temporarily regarded as a constant during the calculation
of the limit.
(b) We use a graphing device to graph
and 
in Figure 4. Notice that
when 
has horizontal tangents and 
is positive when the tangents have positive
slope. So these graphs serve as a check on our work in part (a).
EXAMPLE 4 If 
, ﬁnd the derivative of . State the domain of

SOLUTION
We see that 
exists if 
, so the domain of 
is 
. This is smaller than
the domain of , which is 
.
Let’s check to see that the result of Example 4 is reasonable by looking at the
graphs of 
and 
in Figure 5. When

is also close to , so
is very large and this corresponds to the steep tangent lines near
in Figure 5(a) and the large values of 
just to the right of 0 in Figure 5(b).
When is large,
is very small and this corresponds to the ﬂatter tangent lines at
the far right of the graph of

Other Notations
If we use the traditional notation 
to indicate that the independent variable is
and the dependent variable is , then some common alternative notations for the
derivative are as follows:
The symbols 
and 
are called differentiation operators because they indicate
the operation of differentiation, which is the process of calculating a derivative.
The symbol 
, which was introduced by Leibniz, should not be regarded as a
ratio (for the time being); it is simply a synonym for 
. Nonetheless, it is a very
useful and suggestive notation, especially when used in conjunction with increment
notation. Referring to Equation 2.7.4, we can rewrite the deﬁnition of derivative in
Leibniz notation in the form

If we want to indicate the value of a derivative 
in Leibniz notation at a speciﬁc
number , we use the notation
or
which is a synonym for 
.
Definition A function 
is differentiable at a if 
exists. It is differ-
entiable on an open interval
[or 
or 
or 
] if it is 
differentiable at every number in the interval.
EXAMPLE 6 Where is the function 
differentiable?
SOLUTION If 
, then 
and we can choose 
small enough that 
and hence

Similarly, for

. Therefore, for

and so

For 
we have to investigate
Let’s compute the left and right limits separately:

Since these limits are different,
does not exist. Thus,

except 0.

CHAPTER 2 LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES
L Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was born in
Leipzig in 1646 and studied law, theol-
ogy, philosophy, and mathematics at the
university there, graduating with a bache-
lor’s degree at age 17. After earning his
doctorate in law at age 20, Leibniz
entered the diplomatic service and spent
most of his life traveling to the capitals of
Europe on political missions. In particu-
lar, he worked to avert a French military
threat against Germany and attempted 
to reconcile the Catholic and Protestant
churches.
His serious study of mathematics did
not begin until 1672 while he was on a
diplomatic mission in Paris. There he built
a calculating machine and met scientists,
like Huygens, who directed his attention
to the latest developments in mathematics
and science. Leibniz sought to develop 
a symbolic logic and system of notation
that would simplify logical reasoning. In
particular, the version of calculus that he
published in 1684 established the nota-
tion and the rules for ﬁnding derivatives
that we use today.
Unfortunately, a dreadful priority dis-
pute arose in the 1690s between the 
followers of Newton and those of Leibniz
as to who had invented calculus ﬁrst.
Leibniz was even accused of plagiarism
by members of the Royal Society in 
England. The truth is that each man
invented calculus independently. Newton
arrived at his version of calculus ﬁrst but,
because of his fear of controversy, did
not publish it immediately. So Leibniz’s
1684 account of calculus was the ﬁrst to
be published.

A formula for 
is given by  
and its graph is shown in Figure 6(b). The fact that 
does not exist is reﬂected
geometrically in the fact that the curve 
does not have a tangent line at 
.
[See Figure 6(a).]
Both continuity and differentiability are desirable properties for a function to have.
The following theorem shows how these properties are related.
Theorem If 
is differentiable at , then 
is continuous at .
Proof To prove that 
is continuous at , we have to show that 
.
We do this by showing that the difference 
approaches 0.
The given information is that 
is differentiable at a, that is,
exists (see Equation 2.7.3). To connect the given and the unknown, we divide and
multiply 
by 
(which we can do when 
):
Thus, using the Product Law and (2.7.3), we can write
To use what we have just proved, we start with 
and add and subtract 
:
Therefore,
is continuous at a.
|
NOTE
G The converse of Theorem 4 is false; that is, there are functions that are con-
tinuous but not differentiable. For instance, the function 
is continuous at 0
because
(See Example 7 in Section 2.3.) But in Example 6 we showed that 
is not differen-
tiable at 0.

How Can a Function Fail to be Differentiable?
We saw that the function 
in Example 6 is not differentiable at 0 and Fig-
ure 6(a) shows that its graph changes direction abruptly when 
. In general, if the
graph of a function has a “corner” or “kink” in it, then the graph of has no tangent
at this point and 
is not differentiable there. [In trying to compute 
, we ﬁnd that
the left and right limits are different.]
Theorem 4 gives another way for a function not to have a derivative. It says that if
is not continuous at , then 
is not differentiable at . So at any discontinuity (for
instance, a jump discontinuity) 
fails to be differentiable.
A third possibility is that the curve has a vertical tangent line when 
, that is,
is continuous at 
and
This means that the tangent lines become steeper and steeper as 
. Figure 7 shows
one way that this can happen; Figure 8(c) shows another. Figure 8 illustrates the three
possibilities that we have discussed.
A graphing calculator or computer provides another way of looking at differentia-
bility. If 
is differentiable at , then when we zoom in toward the point 
the
graph straightens out and appears more and more like a line. (See Figure 9. We saw a
speciﬁc example of this in Figure 3 in Section 2.7.) But no matter how much we zoom
in toward a point like the ones in Figures 7 and 8(a), we can’t eliminate the sharp point
or corner (see Figure 10).

The Second Derivative
If is a differentiable function, then its derivative 
is also a function, so 
may have
a derivative of its own, denoted by 
. This new function 
is called the sec-
ond derivative of 
because it is the derivative of the derivative of . Using Leibniz
notation, we write the second derivative of 
as
EXAMPLE 7 If 
, ﬁnd and interpret 
.
SOLUTION In Example 3 we found that the ﬁrst derivative is 
. So the
second derivative is
The graphs of ,
,
are shown in Figure 11.
We can interpret 
as the slope of the curve 
at the point 
.
In other words, it is the rate of change of the slope of the original curve 
.
Notice from Figure 11 that 
is negative when 
has negative slope
and positive when 
has positive slope. So the graphs serve as a check on
our calculations.
In general, we can interpret a second derivative as a rate of change of a rate of
change. The most familiar example of this is acceleration, which we deﬁne as follows.
If 
is the position function of an object that moves in a straight line, we
know that its ﬁrst derivative represents the velocity 
of the object as a function of
time:
The instantaneous rate of change of velocity with respect to time is called the accel-
eration
of the object. Thus, the acceleration function is the derivative of the veloc-
ity function and is therefore the second derivative of the position function:

EXAMPLE 8 A car starts from rest and the graph of its position function is shown in
Figure 12, where is measured in feet and in seconds. Use it to graph the velocity
and acceleration of the car. What is the acceleration at 
seconds?
SOLUTION By measuring the slope of the graph of 
at 
and 5,
and using the method of Example 1, we plot the graph of the velocity function
in Figure 13. The acceleration when 
s is 
, the slope of the
tangent line to the graph of 
when 
. We estimate the slope of this tangent line
to be
Similar measurements enable us to graph the acceleration function in Figure 14.
The third derivative
is the derivative of the second derivative:
. So
can be interpreted as the slope of the curve 
or as the rate of change
of 
. If 
, then alternative notations for the third derivative are
The process can be continued. The fourth derivative 
is usually denoted by 
. In
general, the th derivative of 
is denoted by 
and is obtained from 
by differen-
tiating 
times. If

SOLUTION In Example 7 we found that 
. The graph of the second derivative
has equation 
and so it is a straight line with slope 6. Since the derivative
is the slope of

for all values of . So 
is a constant function and its graph is a horizontal line.
Therefore, for all values of ,

We can interpret the third derivative physically in the case where the function is the
position function 
of an object that moves along a straight line. Because
, the third derivative of the position function is the derivative of the
acceleration function and is called the jerk:
Thus, the jerk j is the rate of change of acceleration. It is aptly named because a large
jerk means a sudden change in acceleration, which causes an abrupt movement in a
vehicle.
We have seen that one application of second and third derivatives occurs in ana-
lyzing the motion of objects using acceleration and jerk. We will investigate another
application of second derivatives in Section 2.10, where we show how knowledge of
gives us information about the shape of the graph of . In Section 8.9 we will see
how second and higher derivatives enable us to obtain more accurate approximations
of functions than linear approximations and also to represent functions as sums of inﬁ-
nite series.

We have seen that a curve lies very close to its tangent line near the point of tangency.
In fact, by zooming in toward a point on the graph of a differentiable function, we
noticed that the graph looks more and more like its tangent line. (See Figure 2 in
Section 2.6 and Figure 3 in Section 2.7.) This observation is the basis for a method of
ﬁnding approximate values of functions.
The idea is that it might be easy to calculate a value 
of a function, but dif-
ﬁcult (or even impossible) to compute nearby values of f. So we settle for the eas-
ily computed values of the linear function L whose graph is the tangent line of f at
. (See Figure 1.) The following example illustrates the method.
EXAMPLE 1 Use a linear approximation to estimate the values of 
and 
.
SOLUTION The desired values are values of the function 
near 
. From
Example 3 in Section 2.7 we know that the slope of the tangent line to the curve
at the point 
is 
. So an equation of the tangent line is
approximately
or
Because the tangent line lies close to the curve when 
(see Figure 2), the
value of the function is almost the same as the height of the tangent line when
. Thus
Similarly,
It appears from Figure 2 that our estimate for 
is better than our estimate for
and that both estimates are less than the true values because the tangent line lies
below the curve. In fact, this is correct because the true values of these numbers are
In general, we use the tangent line at 
as an approximation to the curve
when x is near a. An equation of this tangent line is
and the approximation
is called the linear approximation or tangent line approximation of f at a. The lin-
ear function whose graph is this tangent line, that is,
is called the linearization of 
at a.

L We will see in Sections 3.8 and 8.9
that linear approximations are very useful
in physics for the purpose of simplifying
a calculation or even an entire theory.
Sometimes it is easier to measure the
derivative of a function than to measure
the function itself. Then the derivative
measurement can be used in the linear
approximation to estimate the function.

EXAMPLE 2 Find the linear approximation for the function 
at 
. Then
use it to approximate the numbers 
,
, and 
. Are these approxima-
tions overestimates or underestimates?
SOLUTION We ﬁrst have to ﬁnd 
, the slope of the tangent line to 
when
. We could estimate 
using numerical or graphical methods as in Sec-
tion 2.7, or we could ﬁnd the value exactly using the deﬁnition of a derivative. In
fact, in Example 4 in Section 2.8, we found that
and so 
. Therefore, an equation of the tangent line at 
is
or
and the linear approximation is
In particular, we have
In Figure 3 we graph the root function 
and its linear approximation
. We see that our approximations are overestimates because the tan-
gent line lies above the curve.
In the following table we compare the estimates from the linear approximation
with the true values. Notice from this table, and also from Figure 3, that the tangent
line approximation gives good estimates when x is close to 1 but the accuracy of the
approximation deteriorates when x is farther away from 1.
Of course, a calculator can give us better approximations than the linear approxi-
mations we found in Examples 1 and 2. But a linear approximation gives an approx-
imation over an entire interval and that is the reason that scientists often use such
approximations. (See Sections 3.8 and 8.9.)
The following example is typical of situations in which we use linear approxima-
tion to predict the future behavior of a function given by empirical data.

EXAMPLE 3 Suppose that after you stuff a turkey its temperature is 
and you
then put it in a 
oven. After an hour the meat thermometer indicates that the
temperature of the turkey is 
and after two hours it indicates 
. Predict the
temperature of the turkey after three hours.
SOLUTION If 
represents the temperature of the turkey after t hours, we are given
that 
, and 
. In order to make a linear approxima-
tion with 
, we need an estimate for the derivative 
. Because
we could estimate 
by the difference quotient with t  1:
This amounts to approximating the instantaneous rate of temperature change by the
average rate of change between t  1 and t  2, which is 
. With this esti-
mate, the linear approximation for the temperature after 3 h is
So the predicted temperature after three hours is 
.
We obtain a more accurate estimate for 
by plotting the given data, as in
Figure 4, and estimating the slope of the tangent line at t  2 to be
Then our linear approximation becomes
and our improved estimate for the temperature is 
.
Because the temperature curve lies below the tangent line, it appears that the
actual temperature after three hours will be somewhat less than 
, perhaps closer
to
.

Many of the applications of calculus depend on our ability to deduce facts about a
function
from information concerning its derivatives. Because 
represents the
slope of the curve 
at the point 
, it tells us the direction in which the
curve proceeds at each point. So it is reasonable to expect that information about 
will provide us with information about 
.
In particular, to see how the derivative of 
can tell us where a function is increas-
ing or decreasing, look at Figure 1. (Increasing functions and decreasing functions
were deﬁned in Section 1.1.) Between 
and 
and between and , the tangent lines
have positive slope and so 
. Between 
and 
the tangent lines have nega-
tive slope and so 
. Thus, it appears that 
increases when 
is positive
and decreases when 
is negative.
It turns out, as we will see in Chapter 4, that what we observed for the function
graphed in Figure 1 is always true. We state the general result as follows.
If 
on an interval, then 
is increasing on that interval.
If 
on an interval, then 
is decreasing on that interval.
EXAMPLE 1
(a) If it is known that the graph of the derivative 
of a function is as shown in
Figure 2, what can we say about ?
(b) If it is known that 
, sketch a possible graph of .
SOLUTION
(a) We observe from Figure 2 that 
is negative when 
, so the origi-
nal function 
must be decreasing on the interval 
. Similarly,
is positive
for 
and for 
, so 
is increasing on the intervals 
and 
.
Also note that, since 
and 
, the graph of 
has horizontal tan-
gents when 
.
(b) We use the information from part (a), and the fact that the graph passes through
the origin, to sketch a possible graph of 
in Figure 3. Notice that 
, so
we have drawn the curve 
passing through the origin with a slope of 
.
Notice also that 
as 
(from Figure 2). So the slope of the curve
approaches 1 as becomes large (positive or negative). That is why we
have drawn the graph of 
in Figure 3 progressively straighter as 
.
We say that the function 
in Example 1 has a local maximum at 
because near
the values of 
are at least as big as the neighboring values. Note that 
is positive to the left of 
and negative just to the right of 
. Similarly,
has a local
minimum at 1, where the derivative changes from negative to positive. In Chapter 4
we will develop these observations into a general method for ﬁnding optimal values
of functions.
What Does f  Say about f ?
Let’s see how the sign of 
affects the appearance of the graph of . Since
, we know that if 
is positive, then 
is an increasing function. This

says that the slopes of the tangent lines of the curve 
increase from left to
right. Figure 4 shows the graph of such a function. The slope of this curve becomes
progressively larger as 
increases and we observe that, as a consequence, the curve
bends upward. Such a curve is called concave upward. In Figure 5, however,
is negative, which means that 
is decreasing. Thus, the slopes of 
decrease from 
left to right and the curve bends downward. This curve is called concave downward.
We summarize our discussion as follows. (Concavity is discussed in greater detail in
Section 4.3.)
If 
on an interval, then 
is concave upward on that interval
If 
on an interval, then 
is concave downward on that interval.
EXAMPLE 2 Figure 6 shows a population graph for Cyprian honeybees raised in an
apiary. How does the rate of population increase change over time? When is this rate
highest? Over what intervals is P concave upward or concave downward?
SOLUTION By looking at the slope of the curve as t increases, we see that the rate of
increase of the population is initially very small, then gets larger until it reaches a
maximum at about t  12 weeks, and decreases as the population begins to level
off. As the population approaches its maximum value of about 75,000 (called the
carrying capacity), the rate of increase,
, approaches 0. The curve appears to be
concave upward on (0, 12) and concave downward on (12, 18).
In Example 2, the population curve changed from concave upward to concave
downward at approximately the point (12, 38,000). This point is called an inﬂection

point of the curve. The signiﬁcance of this point is that the rate of population increase
has its maximum value there. In general, an inﬂection point is a point where a curve
changes its direction of concavity.
EXAMPLE 3 Sketch a possible graph of a function 
that satisﬁes the following 
conditions:
SOLUTION Condition (i) tells us that 
is increasing on 
and decreasing on
. Condition (ii) says that 
is concave upward on 
and 
, and
concave downward on 
. From condition (iii) we know that the graph of 
has
two horizontal asymptotes:
and 
.
We ﬁrst draw the horizontal asymptote 
as a dashed line (see Figure 7).
We then draw the graph of 
approaching this asymptote at the far left, increasing to
its maximum point at 
and decreasing toward the x-axis as 
. We also
make sure that the graph has inﬂection points when 
and 2. Notice that the
curve bends upward for 
and 
, and bends downward when x is between
2 and 2.
Antiderivatives
In many problems in mathematics and its applications, we are given a function 
and
we are required to ﬁnd a function 
whose derivative is . If such a function 
exists,
we call it an antiderivative of . In other words, an antiderivative of 
is a function
such that 
. (In Example 1 we sketched an antiderivative 
of the function 
.)
EXAMPLE 4 Let 
be an antiderivative of the function 
whose graph is shown in
Figure 8.
(a) Where is 
increasing or decreasing?
(b) Where is 
concave upward or concave downward?
(c) At what values of does 
have an inﬂection point?
(d) If 
, sketch the graph of .
(e) How many antiderivatives does 
have?
SOLUTION
(a) We see from Figure 8 that 
for all 
. Since 
is an antiderivative 
of , we have 
and so 
is positive when 
. This means that 
is increasing on 
.

. So

.

(c)

we know that 
changes from concave upward to concave downward at 
, so 
has an inﬂection point there. 
changes from concave downward to concave upward
when 
, so 
has another inﬂection point when 
.
(d) In sketching the graph of , we use the information from parts (a), (b), and (c).
But, for ﬁner detail, we also bear in mind the meaning of an antiderivative:
Because 
, the slope of 
at any value of is equal to the height
of 
. (Of course, this is the exact opposite of the procedure we used in
Example 1 in Section 2.8 to sketch a derivative.)
Therefore, since 
, we start drawing the graph of 
at the given point
with slope 0, always increasing, with upward concavity to 
, downward
concavity to 
, and upward concavity when 
. (See Figure 9.) Notice that
, so 
has a gentle slope at the second inﬂection point. But we see
that the slope becomes steeper when 
.
(e) The antiderivative of 
that we sketched in Figure 9 satisﬁes 
, so its
graph starts at the point 
. But there are many other antiderivatives, whose
graphs start at other points on the y-axis. In fact,
has inﬁnitely many anti-
derivatives; their graphs are obtained from the graph of 
by shifting upward or
downward as in Figure 10.

CHAPTER 2 LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES

In our discussion of the principles of problem solving we considered the problem-
solving strategy of introducing something extra (see page 88). In the following exam-
ple we show how this principle is sometimes useful when we evaluate limits. The idea
is to change the variable—to introduce a new variable that is related to the original
variable—in such a way as to make the problem simpler. Later, in Section 5.5, we will
make more extensive use of this general idea.
EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate 
, where c is a constant.
SOLUTION As it stands, this limit looks challenging. In Section 2.3 we evaluated sev-
eral limits in which both numerator and denominator approached 0. There our strat-
egy was to perform some sort of algebraic manipulation that led to a simplifying
cancellation, but here it’s not clear what kind of algebra is necessary.
So we introduce a new variable t by the equation
We also need to express x in terms of t, so we solve this equation:
Notice that 
is equivalent to 
. This allows us to convert the given limit
into one involving the variable t:
The change of variable allowed us to replace a relatively complicated limit by a
simpler one of a type that we have seen before. Factoring the denominator as a dif-
ference of cubes, we get
EXAMPLE 2 How many lines are tangent to both of the parabolas 
and
? Find the coordinates of the points at which these tangents touch the 
parabolas.
SOLUTION To gain insight into this problem it is essential to draw a diagram. So we
sketch the parabolas 
(which is the standard parabola 
shifted 1
unit upward) and 
(which is obtained by reﬂecting the ﬁrst parabola
about the x-axis). If we try to draw a line tangent to both parabolas, we soon dis-
cover that there are only two possibilities, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Solving

Let P be a point at which one of these tangents touches the upper parabola and
let a be its x-coordinate. (The choice of notation for the unknown is important. Of
course we could have used b or c or 
or 
instead of a. However, it’s not advisable
to use x in place of a because that x could be confused with the variable x in the
equation of the parabola.) Then, since P lies on the parabola 
, its 
y-coordinate must be 
. Because of the symmetry shown in Figure 1, the coor-
dinates of the point Q where the tangent touches the lower parabola must be
.
To use the given information that the line is a tangent, we equate the slope of the
line PQ to the slope of the tangent line at P. We have
If 
, then the slope of the tangent line at P is 
. Using the deﬁni-
tion of the derivative as in Section 2.7, we ﬁnd that 
. Thus, the condition
that we need to use is that
Solving this equation, we get 
, so 
and 
. Therefore, the
points are (1, 2) and (1, 2). By symmetry, the two remaining points are (1, 2)
and (1, 2).
The following problems are meant to test and challenge your problem-solving
skills. Some of them require a considerable amount of time to think through, so don’t
be discouraged if you can’t solve them right away. If you get stuck, you might ﬁnd it
helpful to refer to the discussion of the principles of problem solving on page 88.

In this section we learn how to differentiate constant functions, power functions, poly-
nomials, and exponential functions.
Let’s start with the simplest of all functions, the constant function 
. The
graph of this function is the horizontal line y  c, which has slope 0, so we must have
. (See Figure 1.) A formal proof, from the deﬁnition of a derivative, is also
easy:
In Leibniz notation, we write this rule as follows.

We next look at the functions 
, where n is a positive integer. If n  1, the
graph of 
is the line y  x, which has slope 1 (see Figure 2). So
(You can also verify Equation 1 from the deﬁnition of a derivative.) We have already 
investigated the cases n  2 and n  3. In fact, in Section 2.8 (Exercises 17 and 18)

We have seen how to interpret derivatives as slopes
and rates of change. We have seen how to estimate
derivatives of functions given by tables of values. We
have learned how to graph derivatives of functions that
are deﬁned graphically. We have used the deﬁnition
of a derivative to calculate the derivatives of functions
deﬁned by formulas. But it would be tedious if we
always had to use the deﬁnition, so in this chapter we
develop rules for ﬁnding derivatives without having to
use the deﬁnition directly. These differentiation rules
enable us to calculate with relative ease the derivatives
of polynomials, rational functions, algebraic functions,
exponential and logarithmic functions, and trigono-
metric and inverse trigonometric functions. We then
use these rules to solve problems involving rates of
change, tangents to parametric curves, and the
approximation of functions.

be a reasonable guess that, when n is a positive integer,

out to be true.

In ﬁnding the derivative of 
we had to expand 
. Here we need to expand
and we use the Binomial Theorem to do so:
because every term except the ﬁrst has 
as a factor and therefore approaches 0.
We illustrate the Power Rule using various notations in Example 1.

New Derivatives from Old
When new functions are formed from old functions by addition, subtraction, or multi-
plication by a constant, their derivatives can be calculated in terms of derivatives of
the old functions. In particular, the following formula says that the derivative of a con-
stant times a function is the constant times the derivative of the function.

This equation says that the rate of change of any exponential function is proportional
to the function itself. (The slope is proportional to the height.)
Numerical evidence for the existence of

in Section 1.5.) Thus, we have the following deﬁnition.

If we put 
and, therefore,
in Equation 4, it becomes the following
important differentiation formula.
Derivative of the Natural Exponential Function
Thus, the exponential function 
has the property that it is its own derivative.
The geometrical signiﬁcance of this fact is that the slope of a tangent line to the curve
is equal to the -coordinate of the point (see Figure 7).
EXAMPLE 8 If 
, ﬁnd 
and 
.
SOLUTION Using the Difference Rule, we have
In Section 2.8 we deﬁned the second derivative as the derivative of 
, so
We know that 
is positive for all , so 
for all . Thus, the graph of 
is
concave upward on 
. This is conﬁrmed in Figure 8.
EXAMPLE 9 At what point on the curve 
is the tangent line parallel to the 
line 
?
SOLUTION Since 
, we have 
. Let the x-coordinate of the point in question
be a. Then the slope of the tangent line at that point is 
. This tangent line will be
parallel to the line 
if it has the same slope, that is, 2. Equating slopes, we get
Therefore, the required point is 
. (See Figure 9.)

Building a Better Roller Coaster

ing photographs of your favorite coasters, you decide to make the slope of the ascent 0.8
and the slope of the drop 
. You decide to connect these two straight stretches 
and 
with part of a parabola 
, where and 
are
measured in feet. For the track to be smooth there can’t be abrupt changes in direction, so
you want the linear segments 
and 
to be tangent to the parabola at the transition points
and . (See the ﬁgure.) To simplify the equations you decide to place the origin at .

The formulas of this section enable us to differentiate new functions formed from old
functions by multiplication or division.
The Product Rule
| By analogy with the Sum and Difference Rules, one might be tempted to guess, as
Leibniz did three centuries ago, that the derivative of a product is the product of the
derivatives. We can see, however, that this guess is wrong by looking at a particular
example. Let 
and 
. Then the Power Rule gives 
and
. But 
, so 
. Thus,
. The correct for-
mula was discovered by Leibniz (soon after his false start) and is called the Product
Rule.
Before stating the Product Rule, let’s see how we might discover it. We start by
assuming that 
and 
are both positive differentiable functions. Then
we can interpret the product 
as an area of a rectangle (see Figure 1). If x changes
by an amount 
, then the corresponding changes in u and are
and the new value of the product,
, can be interpreted as the area of
the large rectangle in Figure 1 (provided that 
and 
happen to be positive).
The change in the area of the rectangle is
  the sum of the three shaded areas

improve the design by using a quadratic function

functions:
(a) Write a system of equations in 11 unknowns that ensure that the functions and their

Although we started by assuming (for the geometric interpretation) that all the
quantities are positive, we notice that Equation 1 is always true. (The algebra is valid
whether u, ,

are positive or negative.) So we have proved Equation 2,
known as the Product Rule, for all differentiable functions u and .
The Product Rule If

In words, the Product Rule says that the derivative of a product of two functions is
the ﬁrst function times the derivative of the second function plus the second function
times the derivative of the ﬁrst function.

EXAMPLE 4 A telephone company wants to estimate the number of new residential
phone lines that it will need to install during the upcoming month. At the beginning
of January the company had 100,000 subscribers, each of whom had 1.2 phone
lines, on average. The company estimated that its subscribership was increasing at
the rate of 1000 monthly. By polling its existing subscribers, the company found that
each intended to install an average of 0.01 new phone lines by the end of January.

Estimate the number of new lines the company will have to install in January by
calculating the rate of increase of lines at the beginning of the month.
SOLUTION Let 
be the number of subscribers and let 
be the number of phone
lines per subscriber at time t, where t is measured in months and t  0 corresponds
to the beginning of January. Then the total number of lines is given by
and we want to ﬁnd 
. According to the Product Rule, we have
We are given that 
and 
. The company’s estimates concern-
ing rates of increase are that 
and 
. Therefore,
The company will need to install approximately 2200 new phone lines in January.
Notice that the two terms arising from the Product Rule come from different
sources—old subscribers and new subscribers. One contribution to 
is the number
of existing subscribers (100,000) times the rate at which they order new lines (about
0.01 per subscriber monthly). A second contribution is the average number of lines
per subscriber (1.2 at the beginning of the month) times the rate of increase of sub-
scribers (1000 monthly).
The Quotient Rule
Suppose that and are differentiable functions. If we make the prior assumption that
the quotient function 
is differentiable, then it is not difﬁcult to ﬁnd a formula
for 
in terms of 
and .
Since 
, we can write 
and apply the Product Rule:
Solving this equation for 
, we get
Although we derived this formula under the assumption that F is differentiable, it can
be proved without that assumption (see Exercise 44).

In words, the Quotient Rule says that the derivative of a quotient is the denomina-

G Don’t use the Quotient Rule every time you see a quotient. Sometimes it’s
easier to rewrite a quotient ﬁrst to put it in a form that is simpler for the purpose of
differentiation. For instance, although it is possible to differentiate the function
using the Quotient Rule, it is much easier to perform the division ﬁrst and write the
function as

45,000 people per year. The average annual income was
$21,107 per capita, and this average was increasing at about
$1900 per year (well above the national average of about

Rates of Change in the Natural and Social Sciences

Recall from Section 2.7 that if 
, then the derivative 
can be interpreted
as the rate of change of 
with respect to . In this section we examine some of the
applications of this idea to physics, chemistry, biology, economics, and other sciences.
Let’s recall from Section 2.6 the basic idea behind rates of change. If 
changes
from 
to 
, then the change in is
and the corresponding change in is
The difference quotient 
is the average rate of change of y with respect to x over the interval 
and can
be interpreted as the slope of the secant line 
in Figure 1. Its limit as 
is the
derivative 
, which can therefore be interpreted as the instantaneous rate of
change of 
with respect to 
or the slope of the tangent line at 
. Using
Leibniz notation, we write the process in the form
Whenever the function 
has a speciﬁc interpretation in one of the sciences, its
derivative will have a speciﬁc interpretation as a rate of change. (As we discussed in
Section 2.6, the units for 
are the units for y divided by the units for x.) We now
look at some of these interpretations in the natural and social sciences.
Physics
If 
is the position function of a particle that is moving in a straight line, then
represents the average velocity over a time period 
, and 
represents
the instantaneous velocity (the rate of change of displacement with respect to time).
This was discussed in Sections 2.6 and 2.7, but now that we know the differentiation
formulas, we are able to solve velocity problems more easily.
EXAMPLE 1 The position of a particle is given by the equation
where is measured in seconds and in meters.
(a) Find the velocity at time .
(b) What is the velocity after 2 s? After 4 s?
(c) When is the particle at rest?
(d) When is the particle moving forward (that is, in the positive direction)?
(e) Draw a diagram to represent the motion of the particle.
(f) Find the total distance traveled by the particle during the ﬁrst ﬁve seconds.

(g) Find the acceleration at time and after 4 s.
(h) Graph the position, velocity, and acceleration functions for

(i) When is the particle speeding up? When is it slowing down?
SOLUTION
(a) The velocity function is the derivative of the position function.
(b) The velocity after 2 s means the instantaneous velocity when 
, that is,
The velocity after 4 s is
(c) The particle is at rest when 
, that is,
and this is true when 
or 
. Thus, the particle is at rest after 1 s and after 3 s.
(d) The particle moves in the positive direction when 
, that is,
This inequality is true when both factors are positive 
or when both factors
are negative 
. Thus, the particle moves in the positive direction in the time
intervals 
and 
. It moves backward (in the negative direction) when
.
(e) Using the information from part (d) we make a schematic sketch in Figure 2 of
the motion of the particle back and forth along a line (the -axis).
(f) Because of what we learned in parts (d) and (e), we need to calculate the dis-
tances traveled during the time intervals [0, 1], [1, 3], and [3, 5] separately.
The distance traveled in the ﬁrst second is
From

(i) The particle speeds up when the velocity is positive and increasing (

both positive) and also when the velocity is negative and decreasing (
are
both negative). In other words, the particle speeds up when the velocity and acceler-
ation have the same sign. (The particle is pushed in the same direction it is moving.)
From Figure 3 we see that this happens when

EXAMPLE 2 If a rod or piece of wire is homogeneous, then its linear density is uni-
form and is deﬁned as the mass per unit length 
and measured in kilo-
grams per meter. Suppose, however, that the rod is not homogeneous but that its
mass measured from its left end to a point is 
as shown in Figure 5.
The mass of the part of the rod that lies between 
and 
is given by
, so the average density of that part of the rod is
If we now let 
(that is,
), we are computing the average density over
smaller and smaller intervals. The linear density
at 
is the limit of these average
densities as 
; that is, the linear density is the rate of change of mass with
respect to length. Symbolically,
Thus, the linear density of the rod is the derivative of mass with respect to length.
For instance, if

in kilo-
grams, then the average density of the part of the rod given by

EXAMPLE 3 A current exists whenever electric charges move. Figure 6 shows part of
a wire and electrons moving through a shaded plane surface. If 
is the net charge
that passes through this surface during a time period 
, then the average current
during this time interval is deﬁned as
If we take the limit of this average current over smaller and smaller time intervals,
we get what is called the current
at a given time :
Thus, the current is the rate at which charge ﬂows through a surface. It is measured
in units of charge per unit time (often coulombs per second, called amperes).
Velocity, density, and current are not the only rates of change that are important in
physics. Others include power (the rate at which work is done), the rate of heat ﬂow,
temperature gradient (the rate of change of temperature with respect to position), and
the rate of decay of a radioactive substance in nuclear physics.
Chemistry
EXAMPLE 4 A chemical reaction results in the formation of one or more substances
(called products) from one or more starting materials (called reactants). For
instance, the “equation”
indicates that two molecules of hydrogen and one molecule of oxygen form two
molecules of water. Let’s consider the reaction
where A and B are the reactants and C is the product. The concentration of a reac-
tant A is the number of moles (6.022
10
molecules) per liter and is denoted by
. The concentration varies during a reaction, so 
,
, and 
are all functions
of time 
. The average rate of reaction of the product C over a time interval
is
But chemists are more interested in the instantaneous rate of reaction, which is

obtained by taking the limit of the average rate of reaction as the time interval 
approaches 0:
Since the concentration of the product increases as the reaction proceeds, the deriva-
tive 
will be positive and so the rate of reaction C is positive. The concentra-
tions of the reactants, however, decrease during the reaction, so, to make the rates of
reaction of A and B positive numbers, we put minus signs in front of the derivatives
and 
. Since 
and 
each decrease at the same rate that 
increases, we have
More generally, it turns out that for a reaction of the form
we have
The rate of reaction can be determined by graphical methods (see Exercise 16). In
some cases we can use the rate of reaction to ﬁnd explicit formulas for the concen-
trations as functions of time (see Exercises 7.3).
EXAMPLE 5 One of the quantities of interest in thermodynamics is compressibility. If
a given substance is kept at a constant temperature, then its volume 
depends on its
pressure . We can consider the rate of change of volume with respect to pressure—
namely, the derivative 
. As 
increases,
decreases, so 
. The 
compressibility is deﬁned by introducing a minus sign and dividing this derivative
by the volume :
Thus,
measures how fast, per unit volume, the volume of a substance decreases as
the pressure on it increases at constant temperature.
For instance, the volume 
(in cubic meters) of a sample of air at 
was
found to be related to the pressure 
(in kilopascals) by the equation

Biology
EXAMPLE 6 Let 
be the number of individuals in an animal or plant popula-
tion at time . The change in the population size between the times 
and 
is 
, and so the average rate of growth during the time period
is
The instantaneous rate of growth is obtained from this average rate of growth by
letting the time period 
approach 0:
Strictly speaking, this is not quite accurate because the actual graph of a population
function 
would be a step function that is discontinuous whenever a birth or
death occurs and, therefore, not differentiable. However, for a large animal or plant
population, we can replace the graph by a smooth approximating curve as in Figure 7.
To be more speciﬁc, consider a population of bacteria in a homogeneous nutrient
medium. Suppose that by sampling the population at certain intervals it is deter-
mined that the population doubles every hour. If the initial population is 
and the
time is measured in hours, then

The population function is

In Section 3.1 we discussed derivatives of exponential functions and found that
So the rate of growth of the bacteria population at time t is
For example, suppose that we start with an initial population of 
bacteria.
Then the rate of growth after 4 hours is
This means that, after 4 hours, the bacteria population is growing at a rate of about
1100 bacteria per hour.
EXAMPLE 7 When we consider the ﬂow of blood through a blood vessel, such as a
vein or artery, we can model the shape of the blood vessel by a cylindrical tube with
radius 
and length as illustrated in Figure 8.
Because of friction at the walls of the tube, the velocity of the blood is greatest
along the central axis of the tube and decreases as the distance from the axis
increases until becomes 0 at the wall. The relationship between and is given by
the law of laminar ﬂow discovered by the French physician Jean-Louis-Marie
Poiseuille in 1840. This states that
where 
is the viscosity of the blood and 
is the pressure difference between the
ends of the tube. If 
and are constant, then is a function of with domain

ald’s Blood Flow in Arteries: Theoretic, Experimental, and Clinical Principles,

At

To get a feeling for what this statement means, let’s change our units from centi-
meters to micrometers (
m). Then the radius of the artery is 
m.
The velocity at the central axis is 
ms, which decreases to 
ms at
a distance of 
m. The fact that 
(ms)m means that, when
m, the velocity is decreasing at a rate of about 
ms for each micro-
meter that we proceed away from the center.
Economics
EXAMPLE 8 Suppose 
is the total cost that a company incurs in producing
units of a certain commodity. The function 
is called a cost function. If the 
number of items produced is increased from 
to 
, then the additional cost is
, and the average rate of change of the cost is
The limit of this quantity as 
, that is, the instantaneous rate of change of 
cost with respect to the number of items produced, is called the marginal cost by 
economists:

[Since often takes on only integer values, it may not make literal sense to let 
approach 0, but we can always replace 
by a smooth approximating function as
in Example 6.]
Taking 
and 
large (so that 
is small compared to ), we have
Thus, the marginal cost of producing 
units is approximately equal to the cost of
producing one more unit [the 
st unit].
It is often appropriate to represent a total cost function by a polynomial
where 
represents the overhead cost (rent, heat, maintenance) and the other terms 
represent the cost of raw materials, labor, and so on. (The cost of raw materials may
be proportional to , but labor costs might depend partly on higher powers of 
because of overtime costs and inefﬁciencies involved in large-scale operations.)
For instance, suppose a company has estimated that the cost (in dollars) of pro-
ducing items is
Then the marginal cost function is
The marginal cost at the production level of 500 items is
This gives the rate at which costs are increasing with respect to the production level
when 
and predicts the cost of the 501st item.
The actual cost of producing the 501st item is
Notice that 
.
Economists also study marginal demand, marginal revenue, and marginal proﬁt,
which are the derivatives of the demand, revenue, and proﬁt functions. These will be
considered in Chapter 4 after we have developed techniques for ﬁnding the maximum
and minimum values of functions.
Other Sciences
Rates of change occur in all the sciences. A geologist is interested in knowing the rate
at which an intruded body of molten rock cools by conduction of heat into surround-
ing rocks. An engineer wants to know the rate at which water ﬂows into or out of a
reservoir. An urban geographer is interested in the rate of change of the population
density in a city as the distance from the city center increases. A meteorologist is con-
cerned with the rate of change of atmospheric pressure with respect to height (see
Exercise 15 in Section 7.4).

CHAPTER 3 DIFFERENTIATION RULES

In psychology, those interested in learning theory study the so-called learning
curve, which graphs the performance 
of someone learning a skill as a function of
the training time . Of particular interest is the rate at which performance improves as
time passes, that is,
.
In sociology, differential calculus is used in analyzing the spread of rumors (or
innovations or fads or fashions). If 
denotes the proportion of a population that
knows a rumor by time , then the derivative 
represents the rate of spread of the
rumor (see Exercise 60 in Section 3.5).
Summary
Velocity, density, current, power, and temperature gradient in physics, rate of reaction
and compressibility in chemistry, rate of growth and blood velocity gradient in biol-
ogy, marginal cost and marginal proﬁt in economics, rate of heat ﬂow in geology, rate
of improvement of performance in psychology, rate of spread of a rumor in sociol-
ogy—these are all special cases of a single mathematical concept, the derivative.
This is an illustration of the fact that part of the power of mathematics lies in its
abstractness. A single abstract mathematical concept (such as the derivative) can have
different interpretations in each of the sciences. When we develop the properties of the
mathematical concept once and for all, we can then turn around and apply these
results to all of the sciences. This is much more efﬁcient than developing properties
of special concepts in each separate science. The French mathematician Joseph
Fourier (1768–1830) put it succinctly: “Mathematics compares the most diverse phe-
nomena and discovers the secret analogies that unite them.”

Suppose you are asked to differentiate the function 
The differentiation formulas you learned in the previous sections of this chapter do not
enable you to calculate 
.
Observe that 
is a composite function. In fact, if we let

, then we can write 
, that is,
. We know
how to differentiate both 
and , so it would be useful to have a rule that tells us how
to ﬁnd the derivative of 
in terms of the derivatives of 
and .
It turns out that the derivative of the composite function 
is the product of the
derivatives of and . This fact is one of the most important of the differentiation rules
and is called the Chain Rule. It seems plausible if we interpret derivatives as rates of
change. Regard 
as the rate of change of with respect to ,
as the rate of
change of with respect to , and 
as the rate of change of with respect to .
If changes twice as fast as and changes three times as fast as , then it seems rea-
sonable that changes six times as fast as , and so we expect that

Comments on the Proof of the Chain Rule Let 
be the change in 
corresponding to a
change of 
in , that is,
Then the corresponding change in is 
It is tempting to write
The only ﬂaw in this reasoning is that in (1) it might happen that 
(even
when 
) and, of course, we can’t divide by 0. Nonetheless, this reasoning
does at least suggest that the Chain Rule is true. A full proof of the Chain Rule is
given at the end of this section.
The Chain Rule can be written either in the prime notation
or, if 
and 
, in Leibniz notation:
Equation 3 is easy to remember because if 
and 
were quotients, then we
could cancel 
. Remember, however, that 
has not been deﬁned and 
should
not be thought of as an actual quotient.

When using Formula 3 we should bear in mind that

of when is considered as a function of (called the derivative of with respect to
), whereas

derivative of with respect to ). For instance, in Example 1,

NOTE
G In using the Chain Rule we work from the outside to the inside. Formula 2
says that we differentiate the outer function 
[at the inner function 
] and then we
multiply by the derivative of the inner function.
EXAMPLE 2 Differentiate (a) 
and (b) 
.
SOLUTION
(a) If 
, then the outer function is the sine function and the inner function
is the squaring function, so the Chain Rule gives
(b) Note that 
. Here the outer function is the squaring function and
the inner function is the sine function. So
The answer can be left as 
or written as 
(by a trigonometric iden-
tity known as the double-angle formula).
In Example 2(a) we combined the Chain Rule with the rule for differentiating the
sine function. In general, if

Thus
In a similar fashion, all of the formulas for differentiating trigonometric functions
can be combined with the Chain Rule.
Let’s make explicit the special case of the Chain Rule where the outer function 
is a power function. If 
, then we can write 
where 
By using the Chain Rule and then the Power Rule, we get

CHAPTER 3 DIFFERENTIATION RULES

EXAMPLE 6 Differentiate 
.
SOLUTION In this example we must use the Product Rule before using the Chain Rule:
Noticing that each term has the common factor 
, we could
factor it out and write the answer as
EXAMPLE 7 Differentiate 
.
SOLUTION Here the inner function is 
and the outer function is the expo-
nential function 
. So, by the Chain Rule,
We can use the Chain Rule to differentiate an exponential function with any base
. Recall from Section 1.6 that 
. So
and the Chain Rule gives
because ln a is a constant. So we have the formula
In particular, if a  2, we get
In Section 3.1 we gave the estimate

In Example 6 in Section 3.3 we considered a population of bacteria cells that 
doubles every hour and saw that the population after hours is 
, where

the initial population. Formula 6 enables us to ﬁnd the rate of growth of the bacteria
population:
The reason for the name “Chain Rule” becomes clear when we make a longer chain
by adding another link. Suppose that 
,
, and 
, where , , and
are differentiable functions. Then, to compute the derivative of

we use the Chain Rule twice:
EXAMPLE 8 If 
, then
Notice that we used the Chain Rule twice.
EXAMPLE 9 Differentiate

SOLUTION The outer function is the exponential function, the middle function is the
secant function and the inner function is the tripling function. So we have
Tangents to Parametric Curves
In Section 1.7 we discussed curves deﬁned by parametric equations
The Chain Rule helps us ﬁnd tangent lines to such curves. Suppose 
and 
are dif-
ferentiable functions and we want to ﬁnd the tangent line at a point on the curve where
is also a differentiable function of . Then the Chain Rule gives

CHAPTER 3 DIFFERENTIATION RULES

If 
, we can solve for 
:
Equation 7 (which you can remember by thinking of canceling the 
’s) enables us
to ﬁnd the slope 
of the tangent to a parametric curve without having to elimi-
nate the parameter . If we think of the curve as being traced out by a moving par-
ticle, then 
and 
are the vertical and horizontal velocities of the particle and
Formula 7 says that the slope of the tangent is the ratio of these velocities. We see
from (7) that the curve has a horizontal tangent when 
(provided that
) and it has a vertical tangent when 
(provided that 
).
EXAMPLE 10 Find an equation of the tangent line to the parametric curve
at the point 
. Where does this curve have horizontal or vertical tangents?
SOLUTION At the point with parameter value , the slope is
The point 
corresponds to the parameter value 
, so the slope of the
tangent at that point is
An equation of the tangent line is therefore
Figure 2 shows the curve and its tangent line.
The tangent line is horizontal when 
, which occurs when 
(and 
), that is, when 
. Thus, the curve has horizontal
tangents at the points 
, which we could have guessed from 
Figure 2.
The tangent is vertical when 
(and 
), that is, when
. The corresponding four points on the curve are
. If we look again at Figure 2, we see that our answer appears to be
reasonable.

How to Prove the Chain Rule
Recall that if 
and x changes from a to 
, we deﬁned the increment of
as
According to the deﬁnition of a derivative, we have
So if we denote by the difference between the difference quotient and the derivative,
we obtain
But
Thus, for a differentiable function f, we can write
This property of differentiable functions is what enables us to prove the Chain Rule.
Proof of the Chain Rule Suppose 
is differentiable at a and 
is differ-
entiable at 
. If 
is an increment in x and 
and 
are the correspond-
ing increments in u and y, then we can use Equation 8 to write
where 
as 
. Similarly
where 
as 
. If we now substitute the expression for 
from Equa-
tion 9 into Equation 10, we get
so
As
, Equation 9 shows that 
. So both 
and 
as 
Therefore
This proves the Chain Rule.

57. A Cepheid variable star is a star whose brightness alter-
nately increases and decreases. The most easily visible such
star is Delta Cephei, for which the interval between times of
maximum brightness is 5.4 days. The average brightness of

view of these data, the brightness of Delta Cephei at time ,

; Bézier Curves
The Bézier curves are used in computer-aided design and are named after the French 
mathematician Pierre Bézier (1910–1999), who worked in the automotive industry. A cubic
Bézier curve is determined by four control points,
and
, and is deﬁned by the parametric equations
where 
. Notice that when 
we have 
and when 
we have
, so the curve starts at 
and ends at 
.
1. Graph the Bézier curve with control points 
,
,
, and 
Then, on the same screen, graph the line segments 
,
, and 
. (Exercise 23 in
Section 1.7 shows how to do this.) Notice that the middle control points 
and 
don’t
lie on the curve; the curve starts at 
, heads toward 
and 
without reaching them,
and ends at 
.
2. From the graph in Problem 1 it appears that the tangent at 
passes through 
and the
tangent at 
passes through 
. Prove it.
3. Try to produce a Bézier curve with a loop by changing the second control point in
Problem 1.
4. Some laser printers use Bézier curves to represent letters and other symbols. Experiment
with control points until you ﬁnd a Bézier curve that gives a reasonable representation
of the letter C.
5. More complicated shapes can be represented by piecing together two or more Bézier
curves. Suppose the ﬁrst Bézier curve has control points 
and the second
one has control points 
. If we want these two pieces to join together
smoothly, then the tangents at 
should match and so the points 
,
, and 
all have
to lie on this common tangent line. Using this principle, ﬁnd control points for a pair of
Bézier curves that represent the letter S.

Where Should a Pilot Start Descent?
An approach path for an aircraft landing is shown in the ﬁgure and satisﬁes the following 
conditions:
(i) The cruising altitude is 
when descent starts at a horizontal distance
from touch-
down at the origin.
(ii) The pilot must maintain a constant horizontal speed throughout descent.
(iii) The absolute value of the vertical acceleration should not exceed a constant 
(which is much less than the acceleration due to gravity). 
1. Find a cubic polynomial 
that satisﬁes condition (i) 
by imposing suitable conditions on 
and 
at the start of descent and at 
touchdown.
2. Use conditions (ii) and (iii) to show that  
3. Suppose that an airline decides not to allow vertical acceleration of a plane to exceed
mih . If the cruising altitude of a plane is 35,000 ft and the speed is 300 mih,
how far away from the airport should the pilot start descent?
; 4. Graph the approach path if the conditions stated in Problem 3 are satisﬁed.

It’s not easy to solve Equation 2 for explicitly as a function of by hand. (A com-
puter algebra system has no trouble, but the expressions it obtains are very compli-
cated.) Nonetheless, (2) is the equation of a curve, called the folium of Descartes,
shown in Figure 2 and it implicitly deﬁnes as several functions of . The graphs of
three such functions are shown in Figure 3. When we say that 
is a function deﬁned
implicitly by Equation 2, we mean that the equation
is true for all values of in the domain of .
Fortunately, we don’t need to solve an equation for in terms of in order to ﬁnd
the derivative of . Instead we can use the method of implicit differentiation. This
consists of differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to

ing the resulting equation for

always assumed that the given equation determines

function of so that the method of implicit differentiation can be applied.

. Thus, the tangent is horizontal at (0, 0) and at 
, which 
is approximately (2.5198, 3.1748). Looking at Figure 5, we see that our answer is 
reasonable.
The tangent line is vertical when the denominator in the expression for

Another method is to observe that the equation of the curve is unchanged when x
and y are interchanged, so the curve is symmetric about the line 
. This means
that the horizontal tangents at (0, 0) and 
correspond to vertical tangents at
(0, 0) and 
. (See Figure 5.)

(These are the three functions whose graphs are shown in Figure 3.) You can see that
the method of implicit differentiation saves an enormous amount of work in cases
such as this. Moreover, implicit differentiation works just as easily for equations such

SOLUTION Differentiating implicitly with respect to and remembering that is a

at the origin.
Orthogonal Trajectories
Two curves are called orthogonal if at each point of intersection their tangent lines
are perpendicular. In the next example we use implicit differentiation to show that two
families of curves are orthogonal trajectories of each other; that is, every curve in
one family is orthogonal to every curve in the other family. Orthogonal families arise
in several areas of physics. For example, the lines of force in an electrostatic ﬁeld are
orthogonal to the lines of constant potential. In thermodynamics, the isotherms
(curves of equal temperature) are orthogonal to the ﬂow lines of heat. In aerodynam-
ics, the streamlines (curves of direction of airﬂow) are orthogonal trajectories of the
velocity-equipotential curves.

hyperbolas. See Figure 7.) The equation

ﬁnd a general formula for the roots of an 
th-degree equation (in terms of alge-

families are orthogonal trajectories of each other.
SOLUTION Implicit differentiation of Equation 3 gives
so
Implicit differentiation of Equation 4 gives
From (5) and (6) we see that at any point of intersection of curves from each family,
the slopes of the tangents are negative reciprocals of each other. Therefore, the
curves intersect at right angles.
Derivatives of Inverse Trigonometric Functions
We can use implicit differentiation to ﬁnd the derivatives of the inverse trigonometric
functions, assuming that these functions are differentiable. Recall the deﬁnition of the
arcsine function:

DISCOVERY PROJECT HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS

Hyperbolic Functions
Certain combinations of the exponential functions 
and 
arise so frequently in mathe-
matics and its applications that they deserve to be given special names. This project explores
the properties of functions called hyperbolic functions. The hyperbolic sine, hyperbolic
cosine, hyperbolic tangent, and hyperbolic secant functions are deﬁned by
The reason for the names of these functions is that they are related to the hyperbola in much
the same way that the trigonometric functions are related to the circle.
1. (a)
Sketch, by hand, the graphs of the functions 
and 
on the same
axes and use graphical addition to draw the graph of cosh.
;
(b)
Check the accuracy of your sketch in part (a) by using a graphing calculator or
computer to graph 
. What are the domain and range of this function?
; 2. The most famous application of hyperbolic functions is the use of hyperbolic cosine 
to describe the shape of a hanging wire. It can be proved that if a heavy ﬂexible cable
(such as a telephone or power line) is suspended between two points at the same height,
then it takes the shape of a curve with equation 
called a catenary. (The
Latin word catena means “chain.”) Graph several members of the family of functions
. How does the graph change as 
varies?

In Section 2.9 we considered linear approximations to functions, based on the idea
that a tangent line lies very close to a graph near the point of tangency. Now that we
are equipped with the differentiation rules, we revisit this idea and use graphical meth-
ods to decide how good a linear approximation is. We also see how linear approxi-
mations are applied in physics.

is called the linear approximation or tangent line approximation of 
at a, and the
function
(whose graph is the tangent line) is called the linearization of 
at a. The linear
approximation 
is a good approximation when is near 
(see Figure 1).
EXAMPLE 1 Find the linearization of the function 
at 
and use it
to approximate the numbers 
and 
.
SOLUTION The derivative of 
is
and so we have 
and 
. Putting these values into Equation 2, we see
that the linearization is
The corresponding linear approximation (1) is
In particular, we have:
The linear approximation in Example 1 is illustrated in Figure 2. You can see that,
indeed, the tangent line approximation is a good approximation to the given function
when is near l. Of course, a calculator could give us approximations for 
and
, but the linear approximation gives an approximation over an entire interval.
How good is the approximation that we obtained in Example 1? The next example
shows that by using a graphing calculator or computer we can determine an interval
throughout which a linear approximation provides a speciﬁed accuracy.
EXAMPLE 2 For what values of is the linear approximation
accurate to within 0.5? What about accuracy to within 0.1?
SOLUTION Accuracy to within 0.5 means that the functions should differ by less
than 0.5:

Equivalently, we could write
This says that the linear approximation should lie between the curves obtained by 
shifting the curve 
upward and downward by an amount 0.5. Figure 3 
shows the tangent line 
intersecting the upper curve
at 
and . Zooming in and using the cursor, we estimate that the -coordinate of 
is about 
and the -coordinate of 
is about 8.66. Thus, we see from the graph
that the approximation
is accurate to within 0.5 when 
. (We have rounded to be safe.)
Similarly, from Figure 4 we see that the approximation is accurate to within 0.1
when 
.
Applications to Physics
Linear approximations are often used in physics. In analyzing the consequences of an
equation, a physicist sometimes needs to simplify a function by replacing it with its
linear approximation. For instance, in deriving a formula for the period of a pendu-
lum, physics textbooks obtain the expression 
for tangential accelera-
tion and then replace 
by
with the remark that 
is very close to if is not
too large. [See, for example, Physics: Calculus by Eugene Hecht (Paciﬁc Grove, CA:
Brooks/Cole, 1996), p. 457.] You can verify that the linearization of the function
at a  0 is 
and so the linear approximation at 0 is
(see Exercise 15). So, in effect, the derivation of the formula for the period of a pen-
dulum uses the tangent line approximation for the sine function.
Another example occurs in the theory of optics, where light rays that arrive at shal-
low angles relative to the optical axis are called paraxial rays. In paraxial (or Gaus-
sian) optics, both 
and 
are replaced by their linearizations. In other words,
the linear approximations
and
are used because is close to 0. The results of calculations made with these approxi-
mations became the basic theoretical tool used to design lenses. [See Optics, 2d ed.
by Eugene Hecht (Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1987), p. 134.]
In Section 8.9 we will present several other applications of the idea of linear
approximations.
Differentials
The ideas behind linear approximations are sometimes formulated in the terminology
and notation of differentials. If 
, where 
is a differentiable function, then 
the differential
is an independent variable; that is,
can be given the value of 
any real number. The differential
is then deﬁned in terms of

So 
is a dependent variable; it depends on the values of 
and 
. If 
is given a
speciﬁc value and is taken to be some speciﬁc number in the domain of , then the
numerical value of 
is determined.
The geometric meaning of differentials is shown in Figure 5. Let 
and
be points on the graph of 
and let 
. The correspond-
ing change in is
The slope of the tangent line 
is the derivative 
. Thus, the directed distance
from S to R is 
. Therefore,
represents the amount that the tangent line
rises or falls (the change in the linearization), whereas 
represents the amount that
the curve 
rises or falls when 
changes by an amount 
. Notice from Fig-
ure 5 that the approximation 
becomes better as 
becomes smaller.
If we let 
, then 
and we can rewrite the linear approxima-
tion (1) in the notation of differentials:
For instance, for the function 
in Example 1, we have
If a  1 and 
, then
and
just as we found in Example 1.
Our ﬁnal example illustrates the use of differentials in estimating the errors that
occur because of approximate measurements.
EXAMPLE 3 The radius of a sphere was measured and found to be 21 cm with a pos-
sible error in measurement of at most 0.05 cm. What is the maximum error in using
this value of the radius to compute the volume of the sphere?
SOLUTION If the radius of the sphere is , then its volume is 
. If the error in
the measured value of is denoted by 
, then the corresponding error in the
calculated value of 
is 
, which can be approximated by the differential
When 
and 
, this becomes
The maximum error in the calculated volume is about 277 cm .
NOTE
G Although the possible error in Example 3 may appear to be rather large, a
better picture of the error is given by the relative error, which is computed by divid-

Therefore, the relative error in the volume is approximately three times the relative
error in the radius. In Example 3 the relative error in the radius is approximately
and it produces a relative error of about 0.007 in the vol-
ume. The errors could also be expressed as percentage errors of 
in the radius

(This is known as Poiseuille’s Law; we will show why it 
is true in Section 6.6.) A partially clogged artery can be
expanded by an operation called angioplasty, in which a
balloon-tipped catheter is inﬂated inside the artery in order
to widen it and restore the normal blood ﬂow.
Show that the relative change in 
is about four times the
relative change in . How will a 5% increase in the radius
affect the ﬂow of blood?

The tangent line approximation 
is the best ﬁrst-degree (linear) approximation to 
near 
because 
and 
have the same rate of change (derivative) at . For a better
approximation than a linear one, let’s try a second-degree (quadratic) approximation 
. In
other words, we approximate a curve by a parabola instead of by a straight line. To make
sure that the approximation is a good one, we stipulate the following:
(i)
(
and 
should have the same value at .)
(ii)
(
and 
should have the same rate of change at .)
(iii)
(The slopes of 
and 
should change at the same rate.)

5. Instead of being satisﬁed with a linear or quadratic approximation to 
near 
,
let’s try to ﬁnd better approximations with higher-degree polynomials. We look for an 
th-degree polynomial
such that 
and its ﬁrst 
derivatives have the same values at 
as 
and its ﬁrst 
derivatives. By differentiating repeatedly and setting 
, show that these conditions
are satisﬁed if

CHAPTER 3 DIFFERENTIATION RULES

Before you look at the solution of the following example, cover it up and ﬁrst try to
solve the problem yourself. It might help to consult the principles of problem solving
on page 88.
EXAMPLE For what values of does the equation 
have exactly one 
solution?
SOLUTION One of the most important principles of problem solving is to draw a dia-
gram, even if the problem as stated doesn’t explicitly mention a geometric situation.
Our present problem can be reformulated geometrically as follows: For what values
of does the curve 
intersect the curve 
in exactly one point?
Let’s start by graphing 
and 
for various values of . We know
that, for 
,
is a parabola that opens upward if 
and downward if
. Figure 1 shows the parabolas 
for several positive values of . Most
of them don’t intersect 
at all and one intersects twice. We have the feeling
that there must be a value of (somewhere between 
and 
) for which the
curves intersect exactly once, as in Figure 2.
To ﬁnd that particular value of , we let 
be the -coordinate of the single point
of intersection. In other words,
, so 
is the unique solution of the given
equation. We see from Figure 2 that the curves just touch, so they have a common
tangent line when 
. That means the curves 
and 
have the
same slope when 
. Therefore
Solving the equations 
and 
, we get
Thus,
and
For negative values of we have the situation illustrated in Figure 3: All parabo-
las 
with negative values of intersect 
exactly once. And let’s not
forget about 
: The curve 
is just the -axis, which intersects
exactly once.
To summarize, the required values of are 
and

If we are pumping air into a balloon, both the volume and the radius of the balloon are
increasing and their rates of increase are related to each other. But it is much easier to
measure directly the rate of increase of the volume than the rate of increase of the
radius.
In a related rates problem the idea is to compute the rate of change of one quantity
in terms of the rate of change of another quantity (which may be more easily meas-
ured). The procedure is to ﬁnd an equation that relates the two quantities and then use
the Chain Rule to differentiate both sides with respect to time.
EXAMPLE 1 Air is being pumped into a spherical balloon so that its volume increases
at a rate of 100 cm s. How fast is the radius of the balloon increasing when the
diameter is 50 cm?
SOLUTION We start by identifying two things:
the given information:
the rate of increase of the volume of air is 
and the unknown:
the rate of increase of the radius when the diameter is 50 cm
In order to express these quantities mathematically we introduce some suggestive
notation:
Let V be the volume of the balloon and let r be its radius.
The key thing to remember is that rates of change are derivatives. In this problem,
the volume and the radius are both functions of the time . The rate of increase of
the volume with respect to time is the derivative 
and the rate of increase of the
radius is 
. We can therefore restate the given and the unknown as follows:

We have already investigated some of the applications
of derivatives, but now that we know the differentiation
rules we are in a better position to pursue the applica-
tions of differentiation in greater depth. We show how
to analyze the behavior of families of functions, how to
solve related rates problems (how to calculate rates
that we can’t measure from those that we can), and
how to ﬁnd the maximum or minimum value of a 
quantity. In particular, we will be able to investigate
the optimal shape of a can and to explain the location
of rainbows in the sky.
I According to the Principles of 
Problem Solving discussed on page 88,
the ﬁrst step is to understand the prob-
lem. This includes reading the problem
carefully, identifying the given and the
unknown, and introducing suitable 
notation.

In order to connect

In order to use the given information, we differentiate each side of this equation

Now we solve for the unknown quantity:
If we put 
and 
in this equation, we obtain
The radius of the balloon is increasing at the rate of 
cms.
EXAMPLE 2 A ladder 10 ft long rests against a vertical wall. If the bottom of the
ladder slides away from the wall at a rate of 1 fts, how fast is the top of the ladder
sliding down the wall when the bottom of the ladder is 6 ft from the wall? 
SOLUTION We ﬁrst draw a diagram and label it as in Figure 1. Let feet be the dis-
tance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall and feet the distance from the top
of the ladder to the ground. Note that and are both functions of (time).
We are given that

(See Figure 2.) In this problem, the relationship between and is given by the
Pythagorean Theorem:
Differentiating each side with respect to using the Chain Rule, we have
and solving this equation for the desired rate, we obtain
When 
, the Pythagorean Theorem gives 
and so, substituting these values
and 
, we have
The fact that 
is negative means that the distance from the top of the ladder
to the ground is decreasing at a rate of
. In other words, the top of the ladder is
sliding down the wall at a rate of
.

EXAMPLE 3 A water tank has the shape of an inverted circular cone with base radius
2 m and height 4 m. If water is being pumped into the tank at a rate of 2 m min,
ﬁnd the rate at which the water level is rising when the water is 3 m deep.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst sketch the cone and label it as in Figure 3. Let , , and be the
volume of the water, the radius of the surface, and the height at time , where is
measured in minutes.
We are given that 
m min and we are asked to ﬁnd 
when 
is 
3 m. The quantities 
and 
are related by the equation
but it is very useful to express 
as a function of 
alone. In order to eliminate we
use the similar triangles in Figure 3 to write
and the expression for 
becomes
Now we can differentiate each side with respect to :
so
Substituting 
m and 
m min, we have
Strategy It is useful to recall some of the problem-solving principles from page 88
and adapt them to related rates in light of our experience in Examples 1–3:
1. Read the problem carefully.
2. Draw a diagram if possible.
3. Introduce notation. Assign symbols to all quantities that are functions of time.
4. Express the given information and the required rate in terms of derivatives.
5. Write an equation that relates the various quantities of the problem. If necessary,
use the geometry of the situation to eliminate one of the variables by substitution
(as in Example 3).
6. Use the Chain Rule to differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to .
7. Substitute the given information into the resulting equation and solve for the
unknown rate.
The following examples are further illustrations of the strategy.

closest to the searchlight?

Some of the most important applications of differential calculus are optimization
problems, in which we are required to ﬁnd the optimal (best) way of doing something.
Here are examples of such problems that we will solve in this chapter:
I
What is the shape of a can that minimizes manufacturing costs?
I
What is the maximum acceleration of a space shuttle? (This is an important
question to the astronauts who have to withstand the effects of acceleration.)
I
What is the radius of a contracted windpipe that expels air most rapidly during
a cough?
I
At what angle should blood vessels branch so as to minimize the energy
expended by the heart in pumping blood?
These problems can be reduced to ﬁnding the maximum or minimum values of a func-
tion. Let’s ﬁrst explain exactly what we mean by maximum and minimum values.
Definition A function 
has an absolute maximum (or global maximum)
at if 
for all in , where 
is the domain of . The number 
is called the maximum value of 
on . Similarly,
has an absolute mini-
mum at if 
for all in 
and the number 
is called the min-
imum value of 
on . The maximum and minimum values of 
are called
the extreme values of .
Figure 1 shows the graph of a function with absolute maximum at and absolute 
minimum at . Note that

is the

In Figure 1, if we consider only values of 
near 
[for instance, if we restrict our
attention to the interval 
], then 
is the largest of those values of 
and is
called a local maximum value of . Likewise,
is called a local minimum value of
because 
for 
near [in the interval 
, for instance]. The function
also has a local minimum at . In general, we have the following deﬁnition.
Definition A function 
has a local maximum (or relative maximum) at 
if 
when x is near c. [This means that 
for all in
some open interval containing c.] Similarly,
has a local minimum at if
when is near c.
EXAMPLE 1 The function 
takes on its (local and absolute) maximum
value of 1 inﬁnitely many times, since
for any integer
and
for all . Likewise,
is its minimum value,
where 
is any integer. 
EXAMPLE 2 If 
, then 
because 
for all . Therefore,
is the absolute (and local) minimum value of . This corresponds to the
fact that the origin is the lowest point on the parabola 
. (See Figure 2.) How-
ever, there is no highest point on the parabola and so this function has no maximum
value. 
EXAMPLE 3 From the graph of the function 
, shown in Figure 3, we see that
this function has neither an absolute maximum value nor an absolute minimum
value. In fact, it has no local extreme values either. 
EXAMPLE 4 The graph of the function
is shown in Figure 4. You can see that 
is a local maximum, whereas the
absolute maximum is 
. [This absolute maximum is not a local maxi-
mum because it occurs at an endpoint.] Also,
is a local minimum and
is both a local and an absolute minimum. Note that

local nor an absolute maximum at

We have seen that some functions have extreme values, whereas others do not. The 
following theorem gives conditions under which a function is guaranteed to possess
extreme values.
The Extreme Value Theorem If 
is continuous on a closed interval 
, then
attains an absolute maximum value 
and an absolute minimum value
at some numbers and 
in 
.
The Extreme Value Theorem is illustrated in Figure 5. Note that an extreme value
can be taken on more than once. Although the Extreme Value Theorem is intuitively
very plausible, it is difﬁcult to prove and so we omit the proof.
Figures 6 and 7 show that a function need not possess extreme values if either
hypothesis (continuity or closed interval) is omitted from the Extreme Value Theorem.
The function
whose graph is shown in Figure 6 is deﬁned on the closed interval
[0, 2] but has no maximum value. [Notice that the range of
is [0, 3). The function
takes on values arbitrarily close to 3, but it never actually attains the value 3.] This 
does not contradict the Extreme Value Theorem because 
is not continuous. [None-
theless, a discontinuous function could have maximum and minimum values. See
Exercise 13(b).]
The function t shown in Figure 7 is continuous on the open interval (0, 2) but has
neither a maximum nor a minimum value. [The range of t is 
. The function takes
on arbitrarily large values.] This does not contradict the Extreme Value Theorem
because the interval (0, 2) is not closed.
The Extreme Value Theorem says that a continuous function on a closed interval
has a maximum value and a minimum value, but it does not tell us how to ﬁnd these
extreme values. We start by looking for local extreme values.

Figure 8 shows the graph of a function 
with a local maximum at 
and a local
minimum at . It appears that at the maximum and minimum points the tangent lines
are horizontal and therefore each has slope 0. We know that the derivative is the slope
of the tangent line, so it appears that 
and 
. The following theorem
says that this is always true for differentiable functions.
Fermat’s Theorem If 
has a local maximum or minimum at , and if 
exists, then 
.
Our intuition suggests that Fermat’s Theorem is true. A rigorous proof, using the
deﬁnition of a derivative, is given in Appendix E.
Although Fermat’s Theorem is very useful, we have to guard against reading too
much into it. If 
, then 
, so 
. But 
has no maximum or
minimum at 0, as you can see from its graph in Figure 9. The fact that 
sim-
ply means that the curve 
has a horizontal tangent at 
. Instead of having a
maximum or minimum at 
, the curve crosses its horizontal tangent there.
|
Thus, when 
,
doesn’t necessarily have a maximum or minimum at .
(In other words, the converse of Fermat’s Theorem is false in general.)
We should bear in mind that there may be an extreme value where 
does not
exist. For instance, the function 
has its (local and absolute) minimum
value at 0 (see Figure 10), but the value cannot be found by setting 
because,
as was shown in Example 6 in Section 2.8,
does not exist.
Fermat’s Theorem does suggest that we should at least start looking for extreme
values of at the numbers where 
or where 
does not exist. Such num-
bers are given a special name.
Definition A critical number of a function 
is a number in the domain

CHAPTER 4 APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION
L Fermat’s Theorem is named after
Pierre Fermat (1601–1665), a French
lawyer who took up mathematics as 
a hobby. Despite his amateur status, 
Fermat was one of the two inventors of
analytic geometry (Descartes was the
other). His methods for ﬁnding tangents
to curves and maximum and minimum
values (before the invention of limits and
derivatives) made him a forerunner of
Newton in the creation of differential 
calculus.

[The same result could be obtained by ﬁrst writing 
.] Therefore,
if 
, that is,
, and 
does not exist when 
. Thus,
the critical numbers are and .
In terms of critical numbers, Fermat’s Theorem can be rephrased as follows (com-
pare Deﬁnition 5 with Theorem 4):
If
has a local maximum or minimum at , then is a critical number 
of .
To ﬁnd an absolute maximum or minimum of a continuous function on a closed
interval, we note that either it is local [in which case it occurs at a critical number by
(6)] or it occurs at an endpoint of the interval. Thus, the following three-step proce-
dure always works.
The Closed Interval Method To ﬁnd the absolute maximum and minimum values
of a continuous function 
on a closed interval 
:
1. Find the values of 
at the critical numbers of 
in 
.
2. Find the values of 
at the endpoints of the interval.
3. The largest of the values from Steps 1 and 2 is the absolute maximum
value; the smallest of these values is the absolute minimum value.
EXAMPLE 6
(a) Use a graphing device to estimate the absolute minimum and maximum values
of the function 
.
(b) Use calculus to ﬁnd the exact minimum and maximum values.
SOLUTION
(a) Figure 12 shows a graph of 
in the viewing rectangle 
by 
. By
moving the cursor close to the maximum point, we see that the -coordinates don’t
change very much in the vicinity of the maximum. The absolute maximum value is
about 6.97 and it occurs when 
. Similarly, by moving the cursor close to the
minimum point, we see that the absolute minimum value is about 
and it
occurs when 
. It is possible to get more accurate estimates by zooming in
toward the maximum and minimum points, but instead let’s use calculus.
(b) The function
is continuous on

, we have 
when

Comparing these four numbers and using the Closed Interval Method, we see that
the absolute minimum value is

value is

work.
EXAMPLE 7 The Hubble Space Telescope was deployed on April 24, 1990, by the
space shuttle Discovery. A model for the velocity of the shuttle during this mission,
from liftoff at 
until the solid rocket boosters were jettisoned at 
, is
given by
(in feet per second). Using this model, estimate the absolute maximum and mini-
mum values of the acceleration of the shuttle between liftoff and the jettisoning of the
boosters.
SOLUTION We are asked for the extreme values not of the given velocity function,
but rather of the acceleration function. So we ﬁrst need to differentiate to ﬁnd the
acceleration:
We now apply the Closed Interval Method to the continuous function a on the inter-
val 
. Its derivative is
The only critical number occurs when 
:
Evaluating 
at the critical number and the endpoints, we have
So the maximum acceleration is about

about

55. When a foreign object lodged in the trachea (windpipe)
forces a person to cough, the diaphragm thrusts upward
causing an increase in pressure in the lungs. This is accom-
panied by a contraction of the trachea, making a narrower
channel for the expelled air to ﬂow through. For a given
amount of air to escape in a ﬁxed time, it must move faster
through the narrower channel than the wider one. The
greater the velocity of the airstream, the greater the force on
the foreign object. X rays show that the radius of the circu-
lar tracheal tube contracts to about two-thirds of its normal
radius during a cough. According to a mathematical model
of coughing, the velocity of the airstream is related to the
radius of the trachea by the equation
where is a constant and 
is the normal radius of the tra-
chea. The restriction on is due to the fact that the tracheal

The Calculus of Rainbows
Rainbows are created when raindrops scatter sunlight. They have fascinated mankind since
ancient times and have inspired attempts at scientiﬁc explanation since the time of Aristotle.
In this project we use the ideas of Descartes and Newton to explain the shape, location, and
colors of rainbows. 
1. The ﬁgure shows a ray of sunlight entering a spherical raindrop at . Some of the light
is reﬂected, but the line 
shows the path of the part that enters the drop. Notice that
the light is refracted toward the normal line 
and in fact Snell’s Law says that
, where 
is the angle of incidence,
is the angle of refraction, and
is the index of refraction for water. At 
some of the light passes through the drop
and is refracted into the air, but the line 
shows the part that is reﬂected. (The angle
of incidence equals the angle of reﬂection.) When the ray reaches , part of it is
reﬂected, but for the time being we are more interested in the part that leaves the rain-
drop at . (Notice that it is refracted away from the normal line.) The angle of deviation
is the amount of clockwise rotation that the ray has undergone during this three-
stage process. Thus
Show that the minimum value of the deviation is 
and occurs when
.
The signiﬁcance of the minimum deviation is that when 
we have
, so 
. This means that many rays with 
become deviated
by approximately the same amount. It is the concentration of rays coming from near the
direction of minimum deviation that creates the brightness of the primary rainbow. The
following ﬁgure shows that the angle of elevation from the observer up to the highest
point on the rainbow is 
. (This angle is called the rainbow angle.)

2. Problem 1 explains the location of the primary rainbow but how do we explain the
colors? Sunlight comprises a range of wavelengths, from the red range through orange,
yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. As Newton discovered in his prism experiments
of 1666, the index of refraction is different for each color. (The effect is called disper-
sion.) For red light the refractive index is 
whereas for violet light it is
. By repeating the calculation of Problem 1 for these values of , show that
the rainbow angle is about 
for the red bow and 
for the violet bow. So the
rainbow really consists of seven individual bows corresponding to the seven colors.
3. Perhaps you have seen a fainter secondary rainbow above the primary bow. That results
from the part of a ray that enters a raindrop and is refracted at , reﬂected twice (at 
and ), and refracted as it leaves the drop at 
(see the ﬁgure at the left). This time the
deviation angle 
is the total amount of counterclockwise rotation that the ray under-
goes in this four-stage process. Show that
and 
has a minimum value when
Taking 
, show that the minimum deviation is about 
and so the rainbow angle
for the secondary rainbow is about 
, as shown in the following ﬁgure.
4. Show that the colors in the secondary rainbow appear in the opposite order from those
in the primary rainbow.

In Section 2.10 we discussed how the signs of the ﬁrst and second derivatives 
and 
inﬂuence the shape of the graph of . Here we revisit those facts, giving an
indication of why they are true and using them, together with the differentiation for-
mulas of Chapter 3, to explain the shapes of graphs.
We start with a fact, known as the Mean Value Theorem, that will be useful not only
for present purposes but also for explaining why some of the other basic results of cal-
culus are true.

The Mean Value Theorem If 
is a differentiable function on the interval 
,
then there exists a number between 
and 
such that
or, equivalently,
We can see that this theorem is reasonable by interpreting it geometrically. Figures
1 and 2 show the points 
and 
on the graphs of two differentiable
functions.
The slope of the secant line 
is
which is the same expression as on the right side of Equation 1. Since 
is the slope
of the tangent line at the point 
, the Mean Value Theorem, in the form given
by Equation 1, says that there is at least one point 
on the graph where the
slope of the tangent line is the same as the slope of the secant line 
. In other words,
there is a point 
where the tangent line is parallel to the secant line 
. It seems clear
that there is one such point 
in Figure 1 and two such points 
and 
in Figure 2.
Because our intuition tells us that the Mean Value Theorem is true, we take it as the
starting point for the development of the main facts of calculus. (When calculus is
developed from ﬁrst principles, however, the Mean Value Theorem is proved as a con-
sequence of the axioms that deﬁne the real number system.)
EXAMPLE 1 If an object moves in a straight line with position function 
, then
the average velocity between 
and 
is
and the velocity at 
is 
. Thus, the Mean Value Theorem tells us that at
some time 
between 
and 
the instantaneous velocity 
is equal to that
average velocity. For instance, if a car traveled 180 km in 2 h, then the speedometer
must have read 90 kmh at least once.

L The Mean Value Theorem was ﬁrst 
formulated by Joseph-Louis Lagrange
(1736–1813), born in Italy of a French
father and an Italian mother. He was a
child prodigy and became a professor in
Turin at the tender age of 19. Lagrange
made great contributions to number 
theory, theory of functions, theory of
equations, and analytical and celestial
mechanics. In particular, he applied cal-
culus to the analysis of the stability of the
solar system. At the invitation of Frederick
the Great, he succeeded Euler at the
Berlin Academy and, when Frederick
died, Lagrange accepted King Louis XVI’s
invitation to Paris, where he was given
apartments in the Louvre. He was a kind
and quiet man, though, living only for
science.

The main signiﬁcance of the Mean Value Theorem is that it enables us to obtain
information about a function from information about its derivative. Our immediate use
of this principle is to prove the basic facts concerning increasing and decreasing func-
tions. (See Exercises 45 and 46 for another use.)
Increasing and Decreasing Functions
In Section 1.1 we deﬁned increasing functions and decreasing functions and in Sec-
tion 2.10 we observed from graphs that a function with a positive derivative is increas-
ing. We now deduce this fact from the Mean Value Theorem.
Increasing/Decreasing Test
(a) If 
on an interval, then 
is increasing on that interval.
(b) If 
on an interval, then 
is decreasing on that interval.
Proof
(a) Let 
and 
be any two numbers in the interval with 
. According to the
deﬁnition of an increasing function (page 21) we have to show that 
.
Because we are given that 
, we know that
is differentiable on 
.
So, by the Mean Value Theorem there is a number c between 
and 
such that
Now 
by assumption and 
because 
. Thus, the right
side of Equation 3 is positive, and so
This shows that 
is increasing.
Part (b) is proved similarly.
EXAMPLE 2 Find where the function 
is increasing and
where it is decreasing.
SOLUTION
To use the ID Test we have to know where 
and where 
. This
depends on the signs of the three factors of 
, namely,
,
, and 
.
We divide the real line into intervals whose endpoints are the critical numbers 
,
and 
and arrange our work in a chart. A plus sign indicates that the given expres-
sion is positive, and a minus sign indicates that it is negative. The last column of 
the chart gives the conclusion based on the ID Test. For instance,
for
, so 
is decreasing on (0, 2). (It would also be true to say that
is
decreasing on the closed interval
.)
The graph of 
shown in Figure 3 conﬁrms the information in the chart.

Recall from Section 4.2 that if 
has a local maximum or minimum at , then 
must be a critical number of 
(by Fermat’s Theorem), but not every critical number
gives rise to a maximum or a minimum. We therefore need a test that will tell us
whether or not 
has a local maximum or minimum at a critical number.
You can see from Figure 3 that 
is a local maximum value of 
because 
increases on 
and decreases on 
. Or, in terms of derivatives,
for
and 
for 
. In other words, the sign of 
changes
from positive to negative at . This observation is the basis of the following test.
The First Derivative Test Suppose that is a critical number of a continuous
function .
(a) If 
changes from positive to negative at , then 
has a local maximum
at .
(b) If 
changes from negative to positive at , then 
has a local minimum 
at .
(c) If 
does not change sign at (that is,
is positive on both sides of c or
negative on both sides), then 
has no local maximum or minimum at .
The First Derivative Test is a consequence of the ID Test. In part (a), for instance,
since the sign of 
changes from positive to negative at c, f is increasing to the left
of c and decreasing to the right of c. It follows that f has a local maximum at c.
It is easy to remember the First Derivative Test by visualizing diagrams such as
those in Figure 4.
EXAMPLE 3 Find the local minimum and maximum values of the function 
in
Example 2.
SOLUTION From the chart in the solution to Example 2 we see that 
changes from
negative to positive at 1, so 
is a local minimum value by the First
Derivative Test. Similarly,
changes from negative to positive at 2, so 
is also a local minimum value. As previously noted,
is a local maximum
value because 
changes from positive to negative at 0.
Concavity
Let us recall the deﬁnition of concavity from Section 2.10.
A function (or its graph) is called concave upward on an interval if 
is an
increasing function on . It is called concave downward on if 
is decreas-
ing on .I

Notice in Figure 5 that the slopes of the tangent lines increase from left to right on
the interval 
, so 
is increasing and 
is concave upward (abbreviated CU) on
. [It can be proved that this is equivalent to saying that the graph of 
lies above
all of its tangent lines on 
.] Similarly, the slopes of the tangent lines decrease
from left to right on 
, so 
is decreasing and 
is concave downward (CD) on
.
A point where a curve changes its direction of concavity is called an inﬂection
point. The curve in Figure 5 changes from concave upward to concave downward at
and from concave downward to concave upward at , so both 
and 
are inﬂec-
tion points.
Because 
, we know that if 
is positive, then 
is an increasing func-
tion and so 
is concave upward. Similarly, if 
is negative, then 
is decreasing
and 
is concave downward. Thus, we have the following test for concavity.
Concavity Test
(a) If 
for all in , then the graph of 
is concave upward on .
(b) If 
for all in , then the graph of 
is concave downward on .
In view of the Concavity Test, there is a point of inﬂection at any point where the
second derivative changes sign. A consequence of the Concavity Test is the following
test for maximum and minimum values.
The Second Derivative Test Suppose 
is continuous near .
(a) If 
and 
, then 
has a local minimum at .
(b) If 
and 
, then 
has a local maximum at .
For instance, part (a) is true because 
near c and so
is concave upward
near . This means that the graph of 
lies above its horizontal tangent at c and so
has a local minimum at . (See Figure 6.)

To ﬁnd the critical numbers we set

the Second Derivative Test we evaluate 
at these critical numbers:
Since

the Second Derivative Test gives no information about the critical number 0. But
since 
for

, the First Derivative Test tells us
that 
does not have a local maximum or minimum at 0. [In fact, the expression for
shows that f decreases to the left of 3 and increases to the right of 3.]
Since 
when 
or , we divide the real line into intervals with these
numbers as endpoints and complete the following chart.
The point 
is an inﬂection point since the curve changes from concave
upward to concave downward there. Also 
is an inﬂection point since the
curve changes from concave downward to concave upward there.
Using the local minimum, the intervals of concavity, and the inﬂection points, we
sketch the curve in Figure 7.
NOTE
G The Second Derivative Test is inconclusive when 
. In other words,
at such a point there might be a maximum, there might be a minimum, or there might
be neither (as in Example 4). This test also fails when 
does not exist. In such
cases the First Derivative Test must be used. In fact, even when both tests apply, the
First Derivative Test is often the easier one to use.

EXAMPLE 6 Use the ﬁrst and second derivatives of

SOLUTION Notice that the domain of

totes by computing the left and right limits as

As

This shows that

Now let’s compute the derivative. The Chain Rule gives
Since

no local maximum or minimum. The second derivative is
Since

Some machines produce the complete

only the portion between

To sketch the graph of 
we ﬁrst draw the horizontal asymptote 
(as a
dashed line), together with the parts of the curve near the asymptotes in a prelimi-
nary sketch [Figure 9(a)]. These parts reﬂect the information concerning limits and
the fact that 
is decreasing on both 
and 
. Notice that we have indi-
cated that 
as 
even though 
does not exist. In Figure 9(b) we
ﬁnish the sketch by incorporating the information concerning concavity and the
inﬂection point. In Figure 9(c) we check our work with a graphing device.
EXAMPLE 7 A population of honeybees raised in an apiary started with 50 bees at
time 
and was modeled by the function
where is the time in weeks,
. Use a graph to estimate the time at which
the bee population was growing fastest. Then use derivatives to give a more accurate
estimate.
SOLUTION The population grows fastest when the population curve 
has the
steepest tangent line. From the graph of 
in Figure 10, we estimate that the steepest
tangent occurs when 
, so the bee population was growing most rapidly after
about 12 weeks.
For a better estimate we calculate the derivative 
, which is the rate of
increase of the bee population:
We graph 
in Figure 11 and observe that 
has its maximum value when 
.
To get a still better estimate we note that 
has its maximum value when 
changes from increasing to decreasing. This happens when 
changes from concave
upward to concave downward, so we ask a CAS to compute the second derivative:
We could plot this function to see where it changes from positive to negative, but
instead let’s have the CAS solve the equation 
. It gives the answer

Our ﬁnal example is concerned with families of functions. This means that the
functions in the family are related to each other by a formula that contains one or more
arbitrary constants. Each value of the constant gives rise to a member of the family
and the idea is to see how the graph of the function changes as the constant changes.
EXAMPLE 8 Investigate the family of functions given by 
. What
features do the members of this family have in common? How do they differ?
SOLUTION The derivative is 
. If 
, then 
for all 
(since 
), so 
is always increasing. If 
, then 
when is an
odd multiple of , but 
just has horizontal tangents there and is still an increasing
function. Similarly, if 
, then 
is always decreasing. If 
, then the
equation 
has inﬁnitely many solutions 
and 
has inﬁnitely many minima and maxima.
The second derivative is 
, which is negative when 
and,
in general, when 
, where 
is any integer. Thus, all members
of the family are concave downward on 
,
and concave upward 
on 
,
. This is illustrated by several members of the family in
Figure 12.

The method we used to sketch curves in the preceding section was a culmination of
much of our study of differential calculus. The graph was the ﬁnal object that we pro-
duced. In this section our point of view is completely different. Here we start with a
graph produced by a graphing calculator or computer and then we reﬁne it. We use
calculus to make sure that we reveal all the important aspects of the curve. And with
the use of graphing devices we can tackle curves that would be far too complicated 
to consider without technology. The theme is the interaction between calculus and 
calculators.
EXAMPLE 1 Graph the polynomial 
. Use the graphs
of
and 
to estimate all maximum and minimum points and intervals of concavity.
SOLUTION If we specify a domain but not a range, many graphing devices will deduce
a suitable range from the values computed. Figure 1 shows the plot from one such
device if we specify that 
. Although this viewing rectangle is useful for
showing that the asymptotic behavior (or end behavior) is the same as for 
,
it is obviously hiding some ﬁner detail. So we change to the viewing rectangle
by 
shown in Figure 2.
From this graph it appears that there is an absolute minimum value of about
3 when 
(by using the cursor) and 
is decreasing on 
and increasing on 
. Also there appears to be a horizontal tangent at the
origin and inﬂection points when 
and when is somewhere between 
and 
.
Now let’s try to conﬁrm these impressions using calculus. We differentiate 
and get 
When we graph 
in Figure 3 we see that 
changes from negative to positive
when 
; this conﬁrms (by the First Derivative Test) the minimum value
that we found earlier. But, perhaps to our surprise, we also notice that 
changes
from positive to negative when 
and from negative to positive when 
.
This means that 
has a local maximum at 0 and a local minimum when

but these were hidden in Figure 2. Indeed, if we now zoom in toward the origin in
Figure 4, we see what we missed before: a local maximum value of 0 when 
and a local minimum value of about 
when

What about concavity and inﬂection points? From Figures 2 and 4 there appear to

right of 0. But it’s difﬁcult to determine inﬂection points from the graph of , so we
graph the second derivative 
in Figure 5. We see that 
changes from positive to
negative when 
and from negative to positive when 
. So, correct
to two decimal places,
is concave upward on 
and 
and con-
cave downward on 
. The inﬂection points are 
and
.
We have discovered that no single graph reveals all the important features of 
this polynomial. But Figures 2 and 4, when taken together, do provide an accurate
picture.
EXAMPLE 2 Draw the graph of the function
in a viewing rectangle that contains all the important features of the function. Esti-
mate the maximum and minimum values and the intervals of concavity. Then use
calculus to ﬁnd these quantities exactly.
SOLUTION Figure 6, produced by a computer with automatic scaling, is a disaster.
Some graphing calculators use 
by 
as the default viewing rect-
angle, so let’s try it. We get the graph shown in Figure 7; it’s a major improvement.
The -axis appears to be a vertical asymptote and indeed it is because 
Figure 7 also allows us to estimate the -intercepts: about 
and 
. The 
exact values are obtained by using the quadratic formula to solve the equation
; we get 
.
To get a better look at horizontal asymptotes we change to the viewing rectangle
by 
in Figure 8. It appears that 
is the horizontal asymptote
and this is easily conﬁrmed:
To estimate the minimum value we zoom in to the viewing rectangle 
by
in Figure 9. The cursor indicates that the absolute minimum value is about
when 
and we see that the function decreases on 
and
and increases on 
. The exact values are obtained by differentiating:

Figure 9 also shows that an inﬂection point occurs somewhere between

The analysis using the ﬁrst two derivatives shows that Figures 7 and 8 display all
the major aspects of the curve. 
EXAMPLE 3 Graph the function 
.
SOLUTION Drawing on our experience with a rational function in Example 2, let’s start
by graphing 
in the viewing rectangle 
by 
. From Figure 10 we
have the feeling that we are going to have to zoom in to see some ﬁner detail and
also to zoom out to see the larger picture. But, as a guide to intelligent zooming,
let’s ﬁrst take a close look at the expression for 
. Because of the factors 
and 
in the denominator we expect 
and 
to be the vertical
asymptotes. Indeed
To ﬁnd the horizontal asymptotes we divide numerator and denominator by 
:
This shows that 
, so the -axis is a horizontal asymptote.
It is also very useful to consider the behavior of the graph near the -intercepts.
Since 
is positive,
does not change sign at 0 and so its graph doesn’t cross the
-axis at 0. But, because of the factor 
, the graph does cross the -axis at
and has a horizontal tangent there. Putting all this information together, but
without using derivatives, we see that the curve has to look something like the one
in Figure 11.
Now that we know what to look for, we zoom in (several times) to produce the
graphs in Figures 12 and 13 and zoom out (several times) to get Figure 14.

We can read from these graphs that the absolute minimum is about 
and
occurs when 
. There is also a local maximum 
when 
and a local minimum
when 
. These graphs also show three inﬂection
points near 
,
, and 
and two between 
and . To estimate the inﬂection
points closely we would need to graph 
, but to compute 
by hand is an unrea-
sonable chore. If you have a computer algebra system, then it’s easy to do (see Exer-
cise 15).
We have seen that, for this particular function, three graphs (Figures 12, 13, and
14) are necessary to convey all the useful information. The only way to display all
these features of the function on a single graph is to draw it by hand. Despite the
exaggerations and distortions, Figure 11 does manage to summarize the essential
nature of the function.
EXAMPLE 4 Graph the function 
. For 
, estimate all
maximum and minimum values, intervals of increase and decrease, and inﬂection
points.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst note that 
is periodic with period 
. Also,
is odd and
for all . So the choice of a viewing rectangle is not a problem for this
function: we start with 
by 
. (See Figure 15.) It appears that there
are three local maximum values and two local minimum values in that window. To
conﬁrm this and locate them more accurately, we calculate that
and graph both 
and 
in Figure 16. Using zoom-in and the First Derivative Test,
we estimate the following values.
The second derivative is

we can state that the extended graph in Figure 18 represents

EXAMPLE 5 How does the graph of 
vary as varies?
SOLUTION The graphs in Figures 19 and 20 (the special cases 
and 
)
show two very different-looking curves.
Before drawing any more graphs, let’s see what members of this family have in
common. Since
for any value of , they all have the -axis as a horizontal asymptote. A vertical
asymptote will occur when 
. Solving this quadratic equation,
we get 
. When 
, there is no vertical asymptote (as in Fig-
ure 19). When 
the graph has a single vertical asymptote 
because
When 
there are two vertical asymptotes:
and
(as in Figure 20).
Now we compute the derivative:
This shows that 
when 
(if 
),
when 
, and
when 
. For 
this means that 
increases on 
and decreases on 
. For 
, there is an absolute maximum value
. For 
,
is a local maximum value and
the intervals of increase and decrease are interrupted at the vertical asymptotes.

a transition takes place from two vertical asymptotes to one, and then to none. As 
increases from , we see that the maximum point becomes lower; this is explained
by the fact that 
as 
. As decreases from , the vertical asymp-
totes become more widely separated because the distance between them is
,
which becomes large as 
. Again, the maximum point approaches the -axis
because 
as 
.
There is clearly no inﬂection point when 
. For 
we calculate that
and deduce that inﬂection points occur when 
. So the inﬂec-
tion points become more spread out as increases and this seems plausible from the
last two parts of Figure 21.
In Section 1.7 we used graphing devices to graph parametric curves and in Sec-
tion 3.5 we found tangents to parametric curves. But, as our ﬁnal example shows, we
are now in a position to use calculus to ensure that a parameter interval or a viewing
rectangle will reveal all the important aspects of a curve.
EXAMPLE 6 Graph the curve with parametric equations
in a viewing rectangle that displays the important features of the curve. Find the
coordinates of the interesting points on the curve.
SOLUTION Figure 22 shows the graph of this curve in the viewing rectangle 
by
. Zooming in toward the point 
where the curve intersects itself, we esti-
mate that the coordinates of 
are 
. We estimate that the highest point
on the loop has coordinates 
, the lowest point 
, and the leftmost point
. To be sure that we have discovered all the interesting aspects of the
curve, however, we need to use calculus. From Equation 3.5.7, we have
The vertical tangent occurs when 
, that is,
. So the 
exact coordinates of the leftmost point of the loop are 
and
. Also,
and so horizontal tangents occur when 
. The bottom of the loop
corresponds to 
and, indeed, its coordinates are 
and 
.
Similarly, the coordinates of the top of the loop are exactly what we estimated:
and 
. But what about the parameter value 
? The correspond-
ing point on the curve has coordinates 
. Figure 23
shows the graph of the curve in the viewing rectangle 
. This
shows that the point 
is the lowest point on the curve. We can now be
conﬁdent that there are no hidden maximum or minimum points.

Suppose we are trying to analyze the behavior of the function
Although

behaves near 1. In par-
ticular, we would like to know the value of the limit
In computing this limit we can’t apply Law 5 of limits (the limit of a quotient is the
quotient of the limits, see Section 2.3) because the limit of the denominator is 0. In
fact, although the limit in (1) exists, its value is not obvious because both numerator
and denominator approach 
and is not deﬁned.
In general, if we have a limit of the form
where both

is called an indeterminate form of type . We met some limits of this type in Chap-
ter 2. For rational functions, we can cancel common factors:

But these methods do not work for limits such as (1), so in this section we introduce
a systematic method, known as l’Hospital’s Rule, for the evaluation of indeterminate
forms.
Another situation in which a limit is not obvious occurs when we look for a hori-
zontal asymptote of 
and need to evaluate the limit
It is not obvious how to evaluate this limit because both numerator and denominator
become large as 
. There is a struggle between numerator and denominator. 
If the numerator wins, the limit will be ; if the denominator wins, the answer will 
be 0. Or there may be some compromise, in which case the answer may be some ﬁnite
positive number.
In general, if we have a limit of the form
where both 
(or 
) and 
(or 
), then the limit may or may not
exist and is called an indeterminate form of type
. We saw in Section 2.5 that this
type of limit can be evaluated for certain functions, including rational functions, by
dividing numerator and denominator by the highest power of that occurs in the de-
nominator. For instance,
This method does not work for limits such as (2), but l’Hospital’s Rule also applies to
this type of indeterminate form.
L’Hospital’s Rule Suppose

near 
(except possibly at ). Suppose that

NOTE 1
G L’Hospital’s Rule says that the limit of a quotient of functions is equal to
the limit of the quotient of their derivatives, provided that the given conditions are sat-
isﬁed. It is especially important to verify the conditions regarding the limits of 
and
before using l’Hospital’s Rule.

L L’Hospital’s Rule is named after a
French nobleman, the Marquis de 
l’Hospital (1661–1704), but was discov-
ered by a Swiss mathematician, John
Bernoulli (1667–1748). See Exercise 55
for the example that the Marquis used 
to illustrate his rule. See the project on
page 307 for further historical details.

NOTE 2
G L’Hospital’s Rule is also valid for one-sided limits and for limits at inﬁn-
ity or negative inﬁnity; that is, “
” can be replaced by any of the following sym-
bols:
,
,
,
.
NOTE 3
G For the special case in which 
,
and 
are continuous,
and 
, it is easy to see why l’Hospital’s Rule is true. In fact, using the alter-
native form of the deﬁnition of a derivative, we have
The general version of l’Hospital’s Rule is more difﬁcult; its proof can be found in
more advanced books.

graph shows two differentiable functions

the point

look almost linear. But if the functions
were actually linear, as in the second

SOLUTION Since

Notice that the limit on the right side is now indeterminate of type . But instead of
applying l’Hospital’s Rule a second time as we did in Example 2, we simplify the
expression and see that a second application is unnecessary:

Since the limit on the right side is still indeterminate of type , we apply l’Hospital’s
Rule again:
Again both numerator and denominator approach , so a third application of l’Hos-
pital’s Rule is necessary. Putting together all three steps, we get

The required limit is, in fact, easy to ﬁnd because the function is continuous and
the denominator is nonzero at :
Example 5 shows what can go wrong if you use l’Hospital’s Rule without think-
ing. Other limits can be found using l’Hospital’s Rule but are more easily found by
other methods. (See Examples 3 and 5 in Section 2.3, Example 5 in Section 2.5, and
the discussion at the beginning of this section.) So when evaluating any limit, you
should consider other methods before using l’Hospital’s Rule.
Indeterminate Products
If 
and 
(or 
), then it isn’t clear what the value of
, if any, will be. There is a struggle between 
and . If 
wins, the
answer will be ; if 
wins, the answer will be 
(or 
). Or there may be a com-
promise where the answer is a ﬁnite nonzero number. This kind of limit is called an
indeterminate form of type 
. We can deal with it by writing the product 
as
a quotient:
or
This converts the given limit into an indeterminate form of type or so that we can
use l’Hospital’s Rule.
EXAMPLE 6 Evaluate 
. Use the knowledge of this limit, together with
information from derivatives, to sketch the curve 
.
SOLUTION The given limit is indeterminate because, as 
, the ﬁrst factor (x)
approaches 0 while the second factor 
approaches

sketch the curve in Figure 5.
NOTE 4
G In solving Example 6 another possible option would have been to write
This gives an indeterminate form of the type , but if we apply l’Hospital’s Rule we get
a more complicated expression than the one we started with. In general, when we re-
write an indeterminate product, we try to choose the option that leads to the simpler
limit.
Indeterminate Differences
If 
and 
, then the limit
is called an indeterminate form of type
. Again there is a contest between 
and . Will the answer be 
(
wins) or will it be 
( wins) or will they compro-
mise on a ﬁnite number? To ﬁnd out, we try to convert the difference into a quotient
(for instance, by using a common denominator or rationalization, or factoring out a
common factor) so that we have an indeterminate form of type or .
EXAMPLE 7 Compute

The Origins of l’Hospital’s Rule
L’Hospital’s Rule was ﬁrst published in 1696 in the Marquis de l’Hospital’s calculus text-
book Analyse des Inﬁniment Petits, but the rule was discovered in 1694 by the Swiss mathe-
matician John Bernoulli. The explanation is that these two mathematicians had entered into
a curious business arrangement whereby the Marquis de l’Hospital bought the rights to
Bernoulli’s mathematical discoveries. The details, including a translation of l’Hospital’s
letter to Bernoulli proposing the arrangement, can be found in the book by Eves [1].
Write a report on the historical and mathematical origins of l’Hospital’s Rule. Start by
providing brief biographical details of both men (the dictionary edited by Gillispie [2] is 
a good source) and outline the business deal between them. Then give l’Hospital’s state-
ment of his rule, which is found in Struik’s sourcebook [4] and more brieﬂy in the book of
Katz [3]. Notice that l’Hospital and Bernoulli formulated the rule geometrically and gave
the answer in terms of differentials. Compare their statement with the version of l’Hospital’s
Rule given in Section 4.5 and show that the two statements are essentially the same.

The methods we have learned in this chapter for ﬁnding extreme values have practi-
cal applications in many areas of life. A businessperson wants to minimize costs and
maximize proﬁts. Fermat’s Principle in optics states that light follows the path that
takes the least time. In this section and the next we solve such problems as maximiz-
ing areas, volumes, and proﬁts and minimizing distances, times, and costs.
In solving such practical problems the greatest challenge is often to convert the
word problem into a mathematical optimization problem by setting up the function
that is to be maximized or minimized. Let’s recall the problem-solving principles dis-
cussed on page 88 and adapt them to this situation:
STEPS IN SOLVING OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS
1. Understand the Problem The ﬁrst step is to read the problem carefully until it is
clearly understood. Ask yourself: What is the unknown? What are the given
quantities? What are the given conditions?
2. Draw a Diagram In most problems it is useful to draw a diagram and identify
the given and required quantities on the diagram.
4.6

3. Introduce Notation Assign a symbol to the quantity that is to be maximized or
minimized (let’s call it 
for now). Also select symbols 
for
other unknown quantities and label the diagram with these symbols. It may
help to use initials as suggestive symbols—for example,
for area,
for
height,
for time.
4. Express 
in terms of some of the other symbols from Step 3.
5. If 
has been expressed as a function of more than one variable in Step 4, use
the given information to ﬁnd relationships (in the form of equations) among
these variables. Then use these equations to eliminate all but one of the vari-
ables in the expression for . Thus,
will be expressed as a function of one
variable , say,
. Write the domain of this function.
6. Use the methods of Sections 4.2 and 4.3 to ﬁnd the absolute maximum or
minimum value of . In particular, if the domain of 
is a closed interval, then
the Closed Interval Method in Section 4.2 can be used.
EXAMPLE 1 A farmer has 2400 ft of fencing and wants to fence off a rectangular ﬁeld
that borders a straight river. He needs no fence along the river. What are the dimen-
sions of the ﬁeld that has the largest area?
SOLUTION In order to get a feeling for what is happening in this problem let’s experi-
ment with some special cases. Figure 1 (not to scale) shows three possible ways of
laying out the 2400 ft of fencing. We see that when we try shallow, wide ﬁelds or
deep, narrow ﬁelds, we get relatively small areas. It seems plausible that there is
some intermediate conﬁguration that produces the largest area.
Figure 2 illustrates the general case. We wish to maximize the area 
of the rect-
angle. Let and be the depth and width of the rectangle (in feet). Then we express
in terms of and :
We want to express 
as a function of just one variable, so we eliminate by
expressing it in terms of . To do this we use the given information that the total
length of the fencing is 2400 ft. Thus 
From this equation we have 
, which gives
Note that 
0 and 
(otherwise 
). So the function that we wish to
maximize is
The derivative is 
, so to ﬁnd the critical numbers we solve the

which gives 
. The maximum value of 
must occur either at this critical
number or at an endpoint of the interval. Since 
,
and 
, the Closed Interval Method gives the maximum value as
.
[Alternatively, we could have observed that 
for all , so 
is
always concave downward and the local maximum at 
must be an absolute
maximum.]
Thus, the rectangular ﬁeld should be 600 ft deep and 1200 ft wide.
EXAMPLE 2 A cylindrical can is to be made to hold 1 L of oil. Find the dimensions
that will minimize the cost of the metal to manufacture the can.
SOLUTION Draw the diagram as in Figure 3, where is the radius and 
the height
(both in centimeters). In order to minimize the cost of the metal, we minimize the
total surface area of the cylinder (top, bottom, and sides). From Figure 4 we see that
the sides are made from a rectangular sheet with dimensions 
and h. So the
surface area is
To eliminate 
we use the fact that the volume is given as 1 L, which we take to
be 1000 cm . Thus
which gives 
. Substitution of this into the expression for 
gives
Therefore, the function that we want to minimize is
To ﬁnd the critical numbers, we differentiate:
Then 
when 
, so the only critical number is 
.
Since the domain of 
is 
, we can’t use the argument of Example 1 con-
cerning endpoints. But we can observe that 
for 
and 
for 
, so 
is decreasing for all
to the left of the critical number and
increasing for all
to the right. Thus,
must give rise to an absolute
minimum.
[Alternatively, we could argue that 
as 
and 
as 
,
so there must be a minimum value of 
, which must occur at the critical number.
See Figure 5.]
The value of 
corresponding to 
is
Thus, to minimize the cost of the can, the radius should be 
cm and the
height should be equal to twice the radius, namely, the diameter.

we investigate the most economical
shape for a can by taking into account
other manufacturing costs.
Module 4.6 takes you through
eight additional optimization
problems, including animations of the
physical situations.

NOTE 1
G The argument used in Example 2 to justify the absolute minimum is a vari-
ant of the First Derivative Test (which applies only to local maximum or minimum
values) and is stated here for future reference.
First Derivative Test for Absolute Extreme Values Suppose that is a critical number
of a continuous function 
deﬁned on an interval.
(a) If 
for all 
and 
for all 
, then 
is the
absolute maximum value of .
(b) If 
for all 
and 
for all 
, then 
is the
absolute minimum value of .
NOTE 2
G An alternative method for solving optimization problems is to use implicit
differentiation. Let’s look at Example 2 again to illustrate the method. We work with
the same equations
but instead of eliminating h, we differentiate both equations implicitly with respect 
to r:
The minimum occurs at a critical number, so we set 
, simplify, and arrive at the
equations
and subtraction gives 
, or 
.
EXAMPLE 3 Find the point on the parabola 
that is closest to the point 
.
SOLUTION The distance between the point 
and the point 
is
(See Figure 6.) But if 
lies on the parabola, then 
, so the expression
for 
becomes
(Alternatively, we could have substituted 
to get 
in terms of alone.)
Instead of minimizing , we minimize its square:
(You should convince yourself that the minimum of 
occurs at the same point as
the minimum of 
, but 
is easier to work with.) Differentiating, we obtain
so 
when 
. Observe that 
when 
and 
when
, so by the First Derivative Test for Absolute Extreme Values, the absolute
minimum occurs when 
. (Or we could simply say that because of the geomet-

EXAMPLE 4 A man launches his boat from point 
on a bank of a straight river,
3 km wide, and wants to reach point , 8 km downstream on the opposite bank, as
quickly as possible (see Figure 7). He could row his boat directly across the river to
point 
and then run to , or he could row directly to , or he could row to some
point 
between 
and 
and then run to . If he can row at 6 kmh and run at
8 kmh, where should he land to reach 
as soon as possible? (We assume that the
speed of the water is negligible compared with the speed at which the man rows.)
SOLUTION If we let be the distance from 
to , then the running distance is
and the Pythagorean Theorem gives the rowing distance as
. We use the equation
Then the rowing time is 
and the running time is 
, so the total
time 
as a function of is
The domain of this function 
is 
. Notice that if 
he rows to 
and if
he rows directly to . The derivative of 
is
Thus, using the fact that 
, we have
The only critical number is 
. To see whether the minimum occurs at this
critical number or at an endpoint of the domain 
, we evaluate 
at all three
points:
Since the smallest of these values of 
occurs when 
, the absolute mini-
mum value of 
must occur there. Figure 8 illustrates this calculation by showing

EXAMPLE 5 Find the area of the largest rectangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle
of radius .
SOLUTION 1 Let’s take the semicircle to be the upper half of the circle 
with center the origin. Then the word inscribed means that the rectangle has two
vertices on the semicircle and two vertices on the -axis as shown in Figure 9.
Let 
be the vertex that lies in the ﬁrst quadrant. Then the rectangle has sides
of lengths 
and , so its area is
To eliminate we use the fact that 
lies on the circle 
and so
. Thus
The domain of this function is 
. Its derivative is
which is 0 when 
, that is,
(since 
). This value of gives a 
maximum value of 
since 
and 
. Therefore, the area of the largest
inscribed rectangle is
SOLUTION 2 A simpler solution is possible if we think of using an angle as a variable.
Let 
be the angle shown in Figure 10. Then the area of the rectangle is
We know that 
has a maximum value of 1 and it occurs when 
. So

and it occurs when 
.
Notice that this trigonometric solution doesn’t involve differentiation. In fact, we 
didn’t need to use calculus at all.

41. Ornithologists have determined that some species of birds 
tend to avoid ﬂights over large bodies of water during day-
light hours. It is believed that more energy is required to ﬂy
over water than land because air generally rises over land
and falls over water during the day. A bird with these
tendencies is released from an island that is 5 km from the
nearest point 
on a straight shoreline, ﬂies to a point 
on
the shoreline, and then ﬂies along the shoreline to its nest-
ing area . Assume that the bird instinctively chooses a
path that will minimize its energy expenditure. Points 
and
are 13 km apart.
(a) In general, if it takes 1.4 times as much energy to ﬂy
over water as land, to what point 
should the bird ﬂy in
order to minimize the total energy expended in returning
to its nesting area?
(b) Let 
and L denote the energy (in joules) per kilometer
ﬂown over water and land, respectively. What would a
large value of the ratio WL mean in terms of the bird’s
ﬂight? What would a small value mean? Determine the
ratio 
corresponding to the minimum expenditure of
energy.
(c) What should the value of 
be in order for the bird to
ﬂy directly to its nesting area ? What should the value
of 
be for the bird to ﬂy to 
and then along the
shore to ?
(d) If the ornithologists observe that birds of a certain
species reach the shore at a point 4 km from B, how
many times more energy does it take a bird to ﬂy over
water than land?

CHAPTER 4 APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION
The Shape of a Can
In this project we investigate the most economical shape for a can. We ﬁrst interpret this to
mean that the volume 
of a cylindrical can is given and we need to ﬁnd the height 
and
radius that minimize the cost of the metal to make the can (see the ﬁgure). If we disregard
any waste metal in the manufacturing process, then the problem is to minimize the surface
area of the cylinder. We solved this problem in Example 2 in Section 4.6 and we found that
, that is, the height should be the same as the diameter. But if you go to your cup-
board or your supermarket with a ruler, you will discover that the height is usually greater
than the diameter and the ratio 
varies from 2 up to about 3.8. Let’s see if we can explain
this phenomenon.
1. The material for the cans is cut from sheets of metal. The cylindrical sides are formed
by bending rectangles; these rectangles are cut from the sheet with little or no waste.
But if the top and bottom discs are cut from squares of side 
(as in the ﬁgure), this
leaves considerable waste metal, which may be recycled but has little or no value to the
can makers. If this is the case, show that the amount of metal used is minimized when
2. A more efﬁcient packing of the discs is obtained by dividing the metal sheet into hexa-
gons and cutting the circular lids and bases from the hexagons (see the ﬁgure). Show
that if this strategy is adopted, then
3. The values of 
that we found in Problems 1 and 2 are a little closer to the ones that
actually occur on supermarket shelves, but they still don’t account for everything. If we
look more closely at some real cans, we see that the lid and the base are formed from
discs with radius larger than that are bent over the ends of the can. If we allow for this
we would increase 
. More signiﬁcantly, in addition to the cost of the metal we need
to incorporate the manufacturing of the can into the cost. Let’s assume that most of the
expense is incurred in joining the sides to the rims of the cans. If we cut the discs from
hexagons as in Problem 2, then the total cost is proportional to
where is the reciprocal of the length that can be joined for the cost of one unit area of
metal. Show that this expression is minimized when
;
4. Plot 
as a function of 
and use your graph to argue that when a can is large
or joining is cheap, we should make 
approximately 2.21 (as in Problem 2). But
when the can is small or joining is costly,
should be substantially larger.
5. Our analysis shows that large cans should be almost square but small cans should be tall
and thin. Take a look at the relative shapes of the cans in a supermarket. Is our conclu-
sion usually true in practice? Are there exceptions? Can you suggest reasons why small
cans are not always tall and thin?

In Section 3.3 we introduced the idea of marginal cost. Recall that if 
, the cost
function, is the cost of producing units of a certain product, then the marginal cost
is the rate of change of 
with respect to . In other words, the marginal cost function
is the derivative,
, of the cost function.
The graph of a typical cost function is shown in Figure 1. The marginal cost 
is the slope of the tangent to the cost curve at 
. Notice that the cost curve 
is initially concave downward (the marginal cost is decreasing) because of economies
of scale (more efﬁcient use of the ﬁxed costs of production). But eventually there is
an inﬂection point and the cost curve becomes concave upward (the marginal cost 
is increasing) perhaps because of overtime costs or the inefﬁciencies of a large-scale
operation.
The average cost function
represents the cost per unit when 
units are produced. We sketch a typical average
cost function in Figure 2 by noting that 
is the slope of the line that joins the
origin to the point 
in Figure 1. It appears that there will be an absolute min-
imum. To ﬁnd it we locate the critical point of by using the Quotient Rule to differ-
entiate Equation 1:
Now 
when 
and this gives
Therefore:
If the average cost is a minimum, then
marginal cost  average cost
This principle is plausible because if our marginal cost is smaller than our average
cost, then we should produce more, thereby lowering our average cost. Similarly, if
our marginal cost is larger than our average cost, then we should produce less in order
to lower our average cost.
EXAMPLE 1 A company estimates that the cost (in dollars) of producing
items is
.
(a) Find the cost, average cost, and marginal cost of producing 1000 items,
2000 items, and 3000 items.
(b) At what production level will the average cost be lowest, and what is this mini-
mum average cost?

Now let’s consider marketing. Let 
be the price per unit that the company can
charge if it sells 
units. Then 
is called the demand function (or price function)
and we would expect it to be a decreasing function of . If 
units are sold and the
price per unit is 
, then the total revenue is
and 
is called the revenue function (or sales function). The derivative 
of the rev-
enue function is called the marginal revenue function and is the rate of change of
revenue with respect to the number of units sold.

If units are sold, then the total proﬁt is
and 
is called the proﬁt function. The marginal proﬁt function is , the derivative
of the proﬁt function. In order to maximize proﬁt we look for the critical numbers of

Test. Note that

Suppose that a car dealer offers to sell you a car for $18,000 or for payments of $375
per month for ﬁve years. You would like to know what monthly interest rate the dealer
is, in effect, charging you. To ﬁnd the answer, you have to solve the equation
(The details are explained in Exercise 29.) How would you solve such an equation?
For a quadratic equation 
there is a well-known formula for the
roots. For third- and fourth-degree equations there are also formulas for the roots but
they are extremely complicated. If
is a polynomial of degree 5 or higher, there is no
such formula (see the note on page 241). Likewise, there is no formula that will enable
us to ﬁnd the exact roots of a transcendental equation such as 
.
We can ﬁnd an approximate solution to Equation 1 by plotting the left side of the
equation. Using a graphing device, and after experimenting with viewing rectangles,
we produce the graph in Figure 1.
We see that in addition to the solution 
, which doesn’t interest us, there is a
solution between 0.007 and 0.008. Zooming in shows that the root is approximately
0.0076. If we need more accuracy we could zoom in repeatedly, but that becomes tire-
some. A faster alternative is to use a numerical rootﬁnder on a calculator or computer
algebra system. If we do so, we ﬁnd that the root, correct to nine decimal places, is
0.007628603.
How do those numerical rootﬁnders work? They use a variety of methods, but 
most of them make some use of Newton’s method, which is also called the Newton-
Raphson method. We will explain how this method works, partly to show what hap-
pens inside a calculator or computer, and partly as an application of the idea of 
linear approximation.
The geometry behind Newton’s method is shown in Figure 2, where the root that
we are trying to ﬁnd is labeled . We start with a ﬁrst approximation 
, which is
obtained by guessing, or from a rough sketch of the graph of , or from a computer-
generated graph of
. Consider the tangent line 
to the curve 
at the point
and look at the -intercept of , labeled 
. The idea behind Newton’s
method is that the tangent line is close to the curve and so its -intercept,
, is close
to the -intercept of the curve (namely, the root 
that we are seeking). Because the
tangent is a line, we can easily ﬁnd its -intercept.
To ﬁnd a formula for 
in terms of 
we use the fact that the slope of 
is 
,
so its equation is
Since the -intercept of 
is 
, we set 
and obtain
If 
, we can solve this equation for 
:
We use

Next we repeat this procedure with 
replaced by 
, using the tangent line at
. This gives a third approximation:
If we keep repeating this process we obtain a sequence of approximations 
as shown in Figure 3. In general, if the th approximation is 
and
, then the next approximation is given by
If the numbers 
become closer and closer to as 
becomes large, then we say
that the sequence converges to and we write
| Although the sequence of successive approximations converges to the desired root for
functions of the type illustrated in Figure 3, in certain circumstances the sequence may
not converge. For example, consider the situation shown in Figure 4. You can see that
is a worse approximation than 
. This is likely to be the case when 
is close
to 0. It might even happen that an approximation (such as 
in Figure 4) falls outside
the domain of . Then Newton’s method fails and a better initial approximation 
should be chosen. See Exercises 21–23 for speciﬁc examples in which Newton’s
method works very slowly or does not work at all.

It turns out that this third approximation 
is accurate to four decimal
places.
Suppose that we want to achieve a given accuracy, say to eight decimal places,
using Newton’s method. How do we know when to stop? The rule of thumb that is
generally used is that we can stop when successive approximations 
and 
agree
to eight decimal places. (A precise statement concerning accuracy in Newton’s
method will be given in Exercises 8.9.)
Notice that the procedure in going from 
to 
is the same for all values of .
(It is called an iterative process.) This means that Newton’s method is particularly
convenient for use with a programmable calculator or a computer.
EXAMPLE 2 Use Newton’s method to ﬁnd 
correct to eight decimal places.
SOLUTION First we observe that ﬁnding 
is equivalent to ﬁnding the positive root of
the equation
so we take 
. Then 
and Formula 2 (Newton’s method)
becomes
If we choose 
as the initial approximation, then we obtain
Since

agree to eight decimal places, we conclude that

EXAMPLE 3 Find, correct to six decimal places, the root of the equation 
.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst rewrite the equation in standard form:
Therefore, we let

, so Formula 2
becomes
In order to guess a suitable value for

somewhat less than 1, so let’s take

remembering to put our calculator in radian mode, we get
Since 
and 
agree to six decimal places (eight, in fact), we conclude that the root
of the equation, correct to six decimal places, is 
.
Instead of using the rough sketch in Figure 5 to get a starting approximation for
Newton’s method in Example 3, we could have used the more accurate graph that a
calculator or computer provides. Figure 6 suggests that we use 
as the initial
approximation. Then Newton’s method gives
and so we obtain the same answer as before, but with one fewer step.
You might wonder why we bother at all with Newton’s method if a graphing device
is available. Isn’t it easier to zoom in repeatedly and ﬁnd the roots as we did in Sec-
tion 1.4? If only one or two decimal places of accuracy are required, then indeed
Newton’s method is inappropriate and a graphing device sufﬁces. But if six or eight
decimal places are required, then repeated zooming becomes tiresome. It is usually
faster and more efﬁcient to use a computer and Newton’s method in tandem—the
graphing device to get started and Newton’s method to ﬁnish.

A physicist who knows the velocity of a particle might wish to know its position at a
given time. An engineer who can measure the variable rate at which water is leaking
from a tank wants to know the amount leaked over a certain time period. A biologist
who knows the rate at which a bacteria population is increasing might want to deduce
what the size of the population will be at some future time. In each case, the problem
is to ﬁnd a function 
whose derivative is a known function . If such a function 
exists, it is called an antiderivative of .
Definition A function 
is called an antiderivative of 
on an interval if
for all in .
In Section 2.10 we introduced the idea of an antiderivative and we learned how 
to sketch the graph of an antiderivative of 
if we are given the graph of . Now that
we know the differentiation formulas, we are in a position to ﬁnd explicit expressions
for antiderivatives. For instance, let 
. It is not difﬁcult to discover an anti-
derivative of 
if we keep the Power Rule in mind. In fact, if 
, then
. But the function 
also satisﬁes 
.
Therefore, both 
and 
are antiderivatives of . Indeed, any function of the form
, where 
is a constant, is an antiderivative of . The following theo-
rem says that 
has no other antiderivative. A proof of Theorem 1, using the Mean
Value Theorem, is outlined in Exercise 47.
Theorem If 
is an antiderivative of 
on an interval , then the most gen-
eral antiderivative of 
on is
where 
is an arbitrary constant.
Going back to the function 
, we see that the general antiderivative of 
is
. By assigning speciﬁc values to the constant 
we obtain a family of func-
tions whose graphs are vertical translates of one another (see Figure 1). This makes
sense because each curve must have the same slope at any given value of .

SOLUTION
(a) If

is 
. By
Theorem 1, the most general antiderivative is 
.
(b) Recall from Section 3.7 that
So on the interval 
the general antiderivative of 
is 
. We also
learned that
for all 
. Theorem 1 then tells us that the general antiderivative of 
is
on any interval that doesn’t contain 0. In particular, this is true on each
of the intervals 
and 
. So the general antiderivative of 
is
(c) We use the Power Rule to discover an antiderivative of 
. In fact, if 
,
then
Thus, the general antiderivative of

This is valid for 
since then 
is deﬁned on an interval. If is negative
(but 
), it is valid on any interval that doesn’t contain 0.
As in Example 1, every differentiation formula, when read from right to left, gives
rise to an antidifferentiation formula. In Table 2 we list some particular antideriv-
atives. Each formula in the table is true because the derivative of the function in 
the right column appears in the left column. In particular, the ﬁrst formula says that
the antiderivative of a constant times a function is the constant times the antiderivative
of the function. The second formula says that the antiderivative of a sum is the sum of
the antiderivatives. (We use the notation 
,
.)

Thus, we want to ﬁnd an antiderivative of 
Using the formulas in Table 2 together with Theorem 1, we obtain
In applications of calculus it is very common to have a situation as in Example 2,
where it is required to ﬁnd a function, given knowledge about its derivatives. An equa-
tion that involves the derivatives of a function is called a differential equation. These
will be studied in some detail in Chapter 7, but for the present we can solve some ele-
mentary differential equations. The general solution of a differential equation involves
an arbitrary constant (or constants) as in Example 2. However, there may be some
extra conditions given that will determine the constants and therefore uniquely spec-
ify the solution.

SOLUTION We could try all day to think of a formula for an antiderivative of 
and still
be unsuccessful. A second possibility would be to draw the graph of 
ﬁrst and then
use it to graph 
as in Example 4 in Section 2.10. That would work, but instead let’s
create a more accurate graph by using what is called a direction ﬁeld.
Since 
, the graph of 
has slope 1 when 
. So we draw several
short tangent segments with slope 1, all centered at 
. We do the same for sev-
eral other values of and the result is shown in Figure 3. It is called a direction ﬁeld
because each segment indicates the direction in which the curve 
proceeds
at that point.
Now we use the direction ﬁeld to sketch the graph of . Because of the initial
condition 
, we start at the point 
and draw the graph so that it
follows the directions of the tangent segments. The result is pictured in Figure 4.
Any other antiderivative would be obtained by shifting the graph of 
upward or
downward.
Rectilinear Motion
Antidifferentiation is particularly useful in analyzing the motion of an object moving
in a straight line. Recall that if the object has position function 
, then the
velocity function is 
. This means that the position function is an antideriv-

ative of the velocity function. Likewise, the acceleration function is 
, so the
velocity function is an antiderivative of the acceleration. If the acceleration and the
initial values 
and 
are known, then the position function can be found by
antidifferentiating twice.
EXAMPLE 6 A particle moves in a straight line and has acceleration given by
. Its initial velocity is 
cms and its initial displacement is
cm. Find its position function 
.
SOLUTION Since

Since

An object near the surface of the earth is subject to a gravitational force that pro-
duces a downward acceleration denoted by . For motion close to the earth we may
assume that is constant, its value being about 
ms (or 
fts ).
EXAMPLE 7 A ball is thrown upward with a speed of 
fts from the edge of a cliff
ft above the ground. Find its height above the ground seconds later. When
does it reach its maximum height? When does it hit the ground?
SOLUTION The motion is vertical and we choose the positive direction to be upward.
At time the distance above the ground is 
and the velocity 
is decreasing.
Therefore, the acceleration must be negative and we have
Taking antiderivatives, we have
To determine

One of the most important principles of problem solving is analogy (see page 88). If
you are having trouble getting started on a problem, it is sometimes helpful to start
by solving a similar, but simpler, problem. The following example illustrates the
principle. Cover up the solution and try solving it yourself ﬁrst.

SOLUTION It may be difﬁcult to get started on this problem. (Some students have
tackled it by multiplying out the numerator, but that just creates a mess.) Let’s try
to think of a similar, simpler problem. When several variables are involved, it’s
often helpful to think of an analogous problem with fewer variables. In the present
case we can reduce the number of variables from three to one and prove the analo-
gous inequality
In fact, if we are able to prove (1), then the desired inequality follows because
The key to proving (1) is to recognize that it is a disguised version of a minimum
problem. If we let

In this section we discover that in attempting to ﬁnd the area under a curve or the dis-
tance traveled by a car, we end up with the same special type of limit.
The Area Problem
We begin by attempting to solve the area problem: Find the area of the region 
that
lies under the curve 
from to . This means that , illustrated in Figure 1, is
bounded by the graph of a continuous function 
[where 
], the vertical lines
and 
, and the -axis.
In trying to solve the area problem we have to ask ourselves: What is the meaning
of the word area? This question is easy to answer for regions with straight sides. For
a rectangle, the area is deﬁned as the product of the length and the width. The area of
a triangle is half the base times the height. The area of a polygon is found by dividing
it into triangles (as in Figure 2) and adding the areas of the triangles.

In Chapter 2 we used the tangent and velocity problems
to introduce the derivative, which is the central idea in
differential calculus. In much the same way, this chapter
starts with the area and distance problems and uses
them to formulate the idea of a deﬁnite integral, which
is the basic concept of integral calculus. We will see in
Chapters 6 and 7 how to use the integral to solve prob-
lems concerning volumes, lengths of curves, population
predictions, cardiac output, forces on a dam, work, 
consumer surplus, and baseball, among many others.
There is a connection between integral calculus and
differential calculus. The Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus relates the integral to the derivative, and we
will see in this chapter that it greatly simpliﬁes the solu-
tion of many problems.
L Now is a good time to read (or
reread) A Preview of Calculus (see
page 2). It discusses the unifying ideas
of calculus and helps put in perspective
where we have been and where we
are going.

However, it is not so easy to ﬁnd the area of a region with curved sides. We all have
an intuitive idea of what the area of a region is. But part of the area problem is to make
this intuitive idea precise by giving an exact deﬁnition of area.
Recall that in deﬁning a tangent we ﬁrst approximated the slope of the tangent line
by slopes of secant lines and then we took the limit of these approximations. We pur-
sue a similar idea for areas. We ﬁrst approximate the region 
by rectangles and then
we take the limit of the areas of these rectangles as we increase the number of rect-
angles. The following example illustrates the procedure.
EXAMPLE 1 Use rectangles to estimate the area under the parabola 
from 0 to 1
(the parabolic region S illustrated in Figure 3).
SOLUTION We ﬁrst notice that the area of S must be somewhere between 0 and 1
because S is contained in a square with side length 1, but we can certainly do better
than that. Suppose we divide S into four strips 
,
,
, and 
by drawing the ver-
tical lines 
,
, and 
as in Figure 4(a). We can approximate each strip
by a rectangle whose base is the same as the strip and whose height is the same as
the right edge of the strip [see Figure 4(b)]. In other words, the heights of these
rectangles are the values of the function 
at the right endpoints of the 
subintervals 
,
,
, and 
.
Each rectangle has width and the heights are 
,
,
, and 
. If we let 
be the sum of the areas of these approximating rectangles, we get

Resources / Module 6
/ What Is Area? 
/ Estimating Area under a Parabola
Try placing rectangles to estimate the area.

From Figure 4(b) we see that the area A of S is less than 
, so
Instead of using the rectangles in Figure 4(b) we could use the smaller rectangles
in Figure 5 whose heights are the values of 
at the left-hand endpoints of the sub-
intervals. (The leftmost rectangle has collapsed because its height is 0.) The sum of
the areas of these approximating rectangles is
We see that the area of 
is larger than 
, so we have lower and upper estimates 
for :
We can repeat this procedure with a larger number of strips. Figure 6 shows what
happens when we divide the region 
into eight strips of equal width.
By computing the sum of the areas of the smaller rectangles 
and the sum of
the areas of the larger rectangles 
, we obtain better lower and upper estimates
for :
So one possible answer to the question is to say that the true area of 
lies some-
where between 0.2734375 and 0.3984375.
We could obtain better estimates by increasing the number of strips. The table 
at the left shows the results of similar calculations (with a computer) using 
rect-
angles whose heights are found with left-hand endpoints 
or right-hand end-
points 
. In particular, we see by using 50 strips that the area lies between 
0.3234 and 0.3434. With 1000 strips we narrow it down even more:
lies between
0.3328335 and 0.3338335. A good estimate is obtained by averaging these 
numbers:
.
From the values in the table it looks as if 
is approaching as 
increases. We
conﬁrm this in the next example.

It can be proved that the limit in Deﬁnition 2 always exists, since we are assuming
that 
is continuous. It can also be shown that we get the same value if we use left
endpoints:
In fact, instead of using left endpoints or right endpoints, we could take the height of
the th rectangle to be the value of

instance,

The Distance Problem
Now let’s consider the distance problem: Find the distance traveled by an object dur-
ing a certain time period if the velocity of the object is known at all times. (In a sense
this is the inverse problem of the velocity problem that we discussed in Section 2.1.)
If the velocity remains constant, then the distance problem is easy to solve by means
of the formula
But if the velocity varies, it is not so easy to ﬁnd the distance traveled. We investigate
the problem in the following example.
EXAMPLE 4 Suppose the odometer on our car is broken and we want to estimate the
distance driven over a 30-second time interval. We take speedometer readings every
ﬁve seconds and record them in the following table:
In order to have the time and the velocity in consistent units, let’s convert the veloc-
ity readings to feet per second (1 mih  52803600 fts):
During the ﬁrst ﬁve seconds the velocity doesn’t change very much, so we can esti-
mate the distance traveled during that time by assuming that the velocity is constant.
If we take the velocity during that time interval to be the initial velocity (25 fts),
then we obtain the approximate distance traveled during the ﬁrst ﬁve seconds:
Similarly, during the second time interval the velocity is approximately constant and
we take it to be the velocity when 
s. So our estimate for the distance traveled
from 
s to 
s is

If we add similar estimates for the other time intervals, we obtain an estimate for the
total distance traveled:
We could just as well have used the velocity at the end of each time period
instead of the velocity at the beginning as our assumed constant velocity. Then our
estimate becomes
If we had wanted a more accurate estimate, we could have taken velocity read-
ings every two seconds, or even every second.
Perhaps the calculations in Example 4 remind you of the sums we used earlier to
estimate areas. The similarity is explained when we sketch a graph of the velocity
function of the car in Figure 16 and draw rectangles whose heights are the initial
velocities for each time interval. The area of the ﬁrst rectangle is 
,
which is also our estimate for the distanced traveled in the ﬁrst ﬁve seconds. In fact,
the area of each rectangle can be interpreted as a distance because the height repre-
sents velocity and the width represents time. The sum of the areas of the rectangles in
Figure 16 is 
, which is our initial estimate for the total distance traveled.
In general, suppose an object moves with velocity 
, where 
and
(so the object always moves in the positive direction). We take velocity read-
ings at times 
so that the velocity is approximately constant
on each subinterval. If these times are equally spaced, then the time between consec-
utive readings is 
. During the ﬁrst time interval the velocity is approx-
imately 
and so the distance traveled is approximately 
. Similarly, the 
distance traveled during the second time interval is about 
and the total dis-
tance traveled during the time interval 
is approximately
If we use the velocity at right-hand endpoints instead of left-hand endpoints, our esti-
mate for the total distance becomes
The more frequently we measure the velocity, the more accurate we expect our esti-
mates to become, so it seems plausible that the exact distance d traveled is the limit

of such expressions:
We will see in Section 5.3 that this is indeed true.
Because Equation 5 has the same form as our expressions for area in Equations 2
and 3, it follows that the distance traveled is equal to the area under the graph of 
the velocity function. In Chapter 6 we will see that other quantities of interest in the
natural and social sciences—such as the work done by a variable force or the cardiac
output of the heart—can also be interpreted as the area under a curve. So when we
compute areas in this chapter, bear in mind that they can be interpreted in a variety of
practical ways.

The speed of a runner increased steadily during the ﬁrst
three seconds of a race. Her speed at half-second intervals is
given in the table. Find lower and upper estimates for the
distance that she traveled during these three seconds.

times necessary to use times 
that are not
equally spaced. We can still estimate distances using the time
periods 
. For example, on May 7, 1992, the
space shuttle Endeavour was launched on mission STS-49,
the purpose of which was to install a new perigee kick motor
in an Intelsat communications satellite. The table, provided
by NASA, gives the velocity data for the shuttle between
liftoff and the jettisoning of the solid rocket boosters.

We saw in Section 5.1 that a limit of the form
arises when we compute an area. We also saw that it arises when we try to ﬁnd the
distance traveled by an object. It turns out that this same type of limit occurs in a wide
variety of situations even when 
is not necessarily a positive function. In Chapter 6
we will see that limits of the form (1) also arise in ﬁnding lengths of curves, volumes
of solids, centers of mass, force due to water pressure, and work, as well as other
quantities. We therefore give this type of limit a special name and notation.
Definition of a Definite Integral If 
is a continuous function deﬁned for
, we divide the interval 
into 
subintervals of equal width
. We let 
( b) be the endpoints of
these subintervals and we choose sample points
in these sub-
intervals, so 
lies in the ith subinterval 
. Then the deﬁnite integral
of 
from
to 
is
NOTE 1
G The symbol was introduced by Leibniz and is called an integral sign. It
is an elongated 
and was chosen because an integral is a limit of sums. In the nota-
tion 
,
is called the integrand and 
and 
are called the limits of inte-
gration; 
is the lower limit and 
is the upper limit. The symbol 
has no ofﬁcial
meaning by itself; 
is all one symbol. The procedure of calculating an inte-
gral is called integration.
NOTE 2
G The deﬁnite integral 
is a number; it does not depend on . In
fact, we could use any letter in place of 
without changing the value of the integral:

is continuous, it can be proved that the
limit in Deﬁnition 2 always exists and gives the same value no matter how we choose

. If we take the sample points to be right-hand endpoints, then
and the deﬁnition of an integral becomes
If we choose the sample points to be left-hand endpoints, then 
and the def-
inition becomes
Alternatively, we could choose 
to be the midpoint of the subinterval or any other
number between 
and .
Although most of the functions that we encounter are continuous, the limit in Deﬁ-
nition 2 also exists if
has a ﬁnite number of removable or jump discontinuities (but
not inﬁnite discontinuities). (See Section 2.4.) So we can also deﬁne the deﬁnite inte-
gral for such functions.
NOTE 4
G The sum
that occurs in Deﬁnition 2 is called a Riemann sum after the German mathematician
Bernhard Riemann (1826–1866). We know that if 
happens to be positive, then the
Riemann sum can be interpreted as a sum of areas of approximating rectangles (see
Figure 1). By comparing Deﬁnition 2 with the deﬁnition of area in Section 5.1, we 
see that the deﬁnite integral 
can be interpreted as the area under the curve
from 
to . (See Figure 2.)
If 
takes on both positive and negative values, as in Figure 3, then the Riemann
sum is the sum of the areas of the rectangles that lie above the -axis and the nega-
tives of the areas of the rectangles that lie below the -axis (the areas of the gold rect-
angles minus the areas of the blue rectangles). When we take the limit of such
Riemann sums, we get the situation illustrated in Figure 4. A deﬁnite integral can be
interpreted as a net area, that is, a difference of areas:

CHAPTER 5 INTEGRALS
L Bernhard Riemann received his Ph.D.
under the direction of the legendary
Gauss at the University of Göttingen and
remained there to teach. Gauss, who
was not in the habit of praising other
mathematicians, spoke of Riemann’s 
“creative, active, truly mathematical mind
and gloriously fertile originality.” The 
deﬁnition (2) of an integral that we use 
is due to Riemann. He also made major
contributions to the theory of functions 
of a complex variable, mathematical
physics, number theory, and the founda-
tions of geometry. Riemann’s broad con-
cept of space and geometry turned out
to be the right setting, 50 years later, 
for Einstein’s general relativity theory. 
Riemann’s health was poor throughout 
his life, and he died of tuberculosis at
the age of 39.

NOTE 5
G Although we have deﬁned 
by dividing 
into subintervals of
equal width, there are situations in which it is advantageous to work with subintervals
of unequal width. For instance, in Exercise 12 in Section 5.1 NASA provided veloc-
ity data at times that were not equally spaced but we were still able to estimate the dis-
tance traveled. And there are methods for numerical integration that take advantage of
unequal subintervals.
If the subinterval widths are 
, we have to ensure that all these
widths approach 0 in the limiting process. This happens if the largest width,
,
approaches 0. So in this case the deﬁnition of a deﬁnite integral becomes
EXAMPLE 1 Express
as an integral on the interval 
.
SOLUTION Comparing the given limit with the limit in Deﬁnition 2, we see that they
will be identical if we choose
(So the sample points are right endpoints and the given limit is of the form of 
Equation 3.) We are given that 
and 
. Therefore, by Deﬁnition 2 or Equa-
tion 3, we have
Later, when we apply the deﬁnite integral to physical situations, it will be impor-
tant to recognize limits of sums as integrals, as we did in Example 1. When Leibniz
chose the notation for an integral, he chose the ingredients as reminders of the limit-
ing process. In general, when we write

Evaluating Integrals
When we use the deﬁnition to evaluate a deﬁnite integral, we need to know how to
work with sums. The following three equations give formulas for sums of powers of
positive integers. Equation 4 may be familiar to you from a course in algebra. Equa-
tions 5 and 6 were discussed in Section 5.1 and are proved in Appendix F.
The remaining formulas are simple rules for working with sigma notation:

The Midpoint Rule
We often choose the sample point 
to be the right endpoint of the th subinterval
because it is convenient for computing the limit. But if the purpose is to ﬁnd an
approximation to an integral, it is usually better to choose 
to be the midpoint of the
interval, which we denote by . Any Riemann sum is an approximation to an integral,
but if we use midpoints we get the following approximation.
Midpoint Rule

Since

approximation given by the Midpoint Rule is the sum of the areas of the rectangles
shown in Figure 11.

than the right endpoint approximation,

Property 2 says that the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals. For positive
functions it says that the area under 
is the area under 
plus the area under t.
Figure 14 helps us understand why this is true: In view of how graphical addition
works, the corresponding vertical line segments have equal height.
In general, Property 2 follows from Equation 3 and the fact that the limit of a sum
is the sum of the limits:
Property 3 can be proved in a similar manner and says that the integral of a con-
stant times a function is the constant times the integral of the function. In other words,
a constant (but only a constant) can be taken in front of an integral sign. Property 4 is
proved by writing 
and using Properties 2 and 3 with 
.
EXAMPLE 6 Use the properties of integrals to evaluate 
.
SOLUTION Using Properties 2 and 3 of integrals, we have
We know from Property 1 that
and we found in Example 2 in Section 5.1 that 
. So
The next property tells us how to combine integrals of the same function over adja-
cent intervals:

Property 8 is useful when all we want is a rough estimate of the size of an integral
without going to the bother of using the Midpoint Rule.

In Section 5.2 we computed integrals from the deﬁnition as a limit of Riemann sums
and we saw that this procedure is sometimes long and difﬁcult. Sir Isaac Newton dis-
covered a much simpler method for evaluating integrals and a few years later Leibniz
made the same discovery. They realized that they could calculate 
if they
happened to know an antiderivative 
of . Their discovery, called the Evaluation
Theorem, is part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which is discussed in the
next section.
Evaluation Theorem If 
is continuous on the interval 
, then
where 
is any antiderivative of , that is,
.
This theorem states that if we know an antiderivative 
of , then we can evaluate
simply by subtracting the values of 
at the endpoints of the interval 
.
It is very surprising that 
, which was deﬁned by a complicated procedure
involving all of the values of 
for between and , can be found by knowing the
values of 
at only two points,
and .
For instance, we know from Section 4.9 that an antiderivative of 
is
, so the Evaluation Theorem tells us that

Comparing this method with the calculation in Example 2 in Section 5.1, where we
found the area under the parabola 
from 0 to 1 by computing a limit of sums,
we see that the Evaluation Theorem provides us with a simple and powerful method.
Although the Evaluation Theorem may be surprising at ﬁrst glance, it becomes
plausible if we interpret it in physical terms. If 
is the velocity of an object and 
is its position at time , then 
, so is an antiderivative of . In Section 5.1
we considered an object that always moves in the positive direction and made the
conjecture that the area under the velocity curve is equal to the distance traveled. In 
symbols:
That is exactly what the Evaluation Theorem says in this context.
Proof of the Evaluation Theorem We divide the interval 
into 
subintervals with
endpoints 
,
,
,
and with length 
. Let 
be any antiderivative of . By subtracting and adding like terms, we can express the
total difference in the 
values as the sum of the differences over the subintervals:
Now 
is continuous (because it’s differentiable) and so we can apply the Mean
Value Theorem to 
on each subinterval 
. Thus, there exists a number 
between 
and 
such that
Therefore
Now we take the limit of each side of this equation as 
. The left side is a
constant and the right side is a Riemann sum for the function , so
When applying the Evaluation Theorem we use the notation
and so we can write
Other common notations are 
and

CHAPTER 5 INTEGRALS
L The Mean Value Theorem was 
discussed in Section 4.3.

EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate  
.
SOLUTION An antiderivative of 
is 
, so we use the Evaluation 
Theorem as follows:
If you compare the calculation in Example 1 with the one in Example 3 in Sec-
tion 5.2, you will see that the Evaluation Theorem gives a much shorter method.
EXAMPLE 2 Find the area under the cosine curve from 
to , where 
.
SOLUTION Since an antiderivative of 
is 
, we have
In particular, taking 
, we have proved that the area under the cosine
curve from 0 to 
is 
. (See Figure 1.)
When the French mathematician Gilles de Roberval ﬁrst found the area under the
sine and cosine curves in 1635, this was a very challenging problem that required a
great deal of ingenuity. If we didn’t have the beneﬁt of the Evaluation Theorem, we
would have to compute a difﬁcult limit of sums using obscure trigonometric identities
(or a computer algebra system as in Exercise 21 in Section 5.1). It was even more dif-
ﬁcult for Roberval because the apparatus of limits had not been invented in 1635. But
in the 1660s and 1670s, when the Evaluation Theorem was discovered by Newton and
Leibniz, such problems became very easy, as you can see from Example 2.
Indefinite Integrals
We need a convenient notation for antiderivatives that makes them easy to work with.
Because of the relation given by the Evaluation Theorem between antiderivatives and
integrals, the notation 
is traditionally used for an antiderivative of 
and is
called an indeﬁnite integral. Thus
means
|
You should distinguish carefully between deﬁnite and indeﬁnite integrals. A def-
inite integral 
is a number, whereas an indeﬁnite integral 
is a 
function. The connection between them is given by the Evaluation Theorem: If 
is
continuous on 
, then
Recall from Section 4.9 that if 
is an antiderivative of 
on an interval , then the
most general antiderivative of 
on is 
, where 
is an arbitrary constant.

is valid (on any interval that doesn’t contain 0) because 
. So an
indeﬁnite integral 
can represent either a particular antiderivative of 
or an
entire family of antiderivatives (one for each value of the constant ).
The effectiveness of the Evaluation Theorem depends on having a supply of anti-
derivatives of functions. We therefore restate the Table of Antidifferentiation Formulas
from Section 4.9, together with a few others, in the notation of indeﬁnite integrals.
Any formula can be veriﬁed by differentiating the function on the right side and ob-
taining the integrand. For instance,

This is the exact value of the integral. If a decimal approximation is desired, we can
use a calculator to approximate

Figure 3 shows the graph of the integrand. We know from Section 5.2 that the value
of the integral can be interpreted as the sum of the areas labeled with a plus sign
minus the area labeled with a minus sign.

Applications
The Evaluation Theorem says that if 
is continuous on 
, then
where 
is any antiderivative of . This means that 
, so the equation can be
rewritten as
We know that 
represents the rate of change of 
with respect to x and
is the change in y when x changes from a to b. So we can reformulate the
Evaluation Theorem in words as follows.
Total Change Theorem The integral of a rate of change is the total change:
This principle can be applied to all of the rates of change in the natural and social
sciences that we discussed in Section 3.3. Here are a few instances of this idea:
I
If 
is the volume of water in a reservoir at time t, then its derivative
is the rate at which water ﬂows into the reservoir at time t. So
is the change in the amount of water in the reservoir between time
and
time
.
I
If 
is the concentration of the product of a chemical reaction at time t,
then the rate of reaction is the derivative 
. So
is the change in the concentration of C from time 
to time .
I
If the mass of a rod measured from the left end to a point x is 
, then
the linear density is 
. So
is the mass of the segment of the rod that lies between 
and 
.
I
If the rate of growth of a population is 
, then
is the increase in population during the time period from 
to .

If 
is the cost of producing x units of a commodity, then the marginal
cost is the derivative 
. So
is the increase in cost when production is increased from 
units to
units.
I
If an object moves along a straight line with position function 
, then its
velocity is 
, so
is the change of position, or displacement, of the particle during the time
period from 
to . In Section 5.1 we guessed that this was true for the
case where the object moves in the positive direction, but now we have
proved that it is always true.
I
If we want to calculate the distance traveled during the time interval, we
have to consider the intervals when 
(the particle moves to the
right) and also the intervals when 
(the particle moves to the left).
In both cases the distance is computed by integrating 
, the speed.
Therefore
Figure 4 shows how both displacement and distance traveled can be inter-
preted in terms of areas under a velocity curve.
I
The acceleration of the object is 
, so
is the change in velocity from time 
to time .
EXAMPLE 7 A particle moves along a line so that its velocity at time is
(measured in meters per second).
(a) Find the displacement of the particle during the time period 
.
(b) Find the distance traveled during this time period.
SOLUTION
(a) By Equation 2, the displacement is
This means that the particle’s position at time 
is 4.5 m to the left of its posi-
tion at the start of the time period.

EXAMPLE 8 Figure 5 shows the power consumption in the city of San Francisco for
September 19, 1996 (P is measured in megawatts; t is measured in hours starting at
midnight). Estimate the energy used on that day.
SOLUTION Power is the rate of change of energy:
. So, by the Total Change
Theorem,
is the total amount of energy used on September 19, 1996. We approximate the
value of the integral using the Midpoint Rule with 12 subintervals and 
:
The energy used was approximately 15,840 megawatt-hours.
L A note on units
How did we know what units to use for energy in Example 8? The integral
is deﬁned as the limit of sums of terms of the form 
. Now 
is
measured in megawatts and 
is measured in hours, so their product is measured in
megawatt-hours. The same is true of the limit. In general, the unit of measurement for
is the product of the unit for 
and the unit for x.

continuous, increasing, and concave upward. The points on
this curve are determined by ranking all households by
income and then computing the percentage of households
whose income is less than or equal to a given percentage of
the total income of the country. For example, the point
is on the Lorenz curve if the bottom

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is appropriately named because it establishes
a connection between the two branches of calculus: differential calculus and integral
calculus. Differential calculus arose from the tangent problem, whereas integral cal-
culus arose from a seemingly unrelated problem, the area problem. Newton’s teacher
at Cambridge, Isaac Barrow (1630–1677), discovered that these two problems are
actually closely related. In fact, he realized that differentiation and integration are
inverse processes. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gives the precise inverse
relationship between the derivative and the integral. It was Newton and Leibniz who
exploited this relationship and used it to develop calculus into a systematic mathema-
tical method.
The ﬁrst part of the Fundamental Theorem deals with functions deﬁned by an equa-
tion of the form

is
a ﬁxed number, then the integral 
is a deﬁnite number. If we then let 
vary,
the number 
also varies and deﬁnes a function of denoted by

the graph of

For the function in Example 2 notice that

So we suspect that

To see why this might be generally true we consider any continuous function

In order to compute

you can see from
the ﬁgure that this area is approximately equal to the area of the rectangle with height
and width :

Intuitively, we therefore expect that
The fact that this is true, even when

Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

and then differentiate the result, we get back to the original function .
It is easy to prove the Fundamental Theorem if we make the assumption that pos-
sesses an antiderivative . (This is certainly plausible. After all, we sketched graphs

may seem like a strange
way of deﬁning a function, books on physics, chemistry, and statistics are full of
such functions. For instance, the Fresnel function
is named after the French physicist Augustin Fresnel (1788–1827), who is famous
for his works in optics. This function ﬁrst appeared in Fresnel’s theory of the 
diffraction of light waves, but more recently it has been applied to the design of
highways.
Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem tells us how to differentiate the Fresnel 
function:
This means that we can apply all the methods of differential calculus to analyze 
(see Exercise 21).

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is unquestionably the most important theo-
rem in calculus and, indeed, it ranks as one of the great accomplishments of the human
mind. Before it was discovered, from the time of Eudoxus and Archimedes to the time
of Galileo and Fermat, problems of ﬁnding areas, volumes, and lengths of curves were
so difﬁcult that only a genius could meet the challenge. But now, armed with the sys-
tematic method that Newton and Leibniz fashioned out of the Fundamental Theorem,
we will see in the chapters to come that these challenging problems are accessible to
all of us.
Proof of FTC1
Here we give a proof of Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus without
assuming the existence of an antiderivative of . Let 
. If and

are the absolute minimum and maximum values of

By Property 8 of integrals, we have
that is,
Since

CHAPTER 5 INTEGRALS
Newton, Leibniz, and the Invention of Calculus
We sometimes read that the inventors of calculus were Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727) and 
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716). But we know that the basic ideas behind integra-
tion were investigated 2500 years ago by ancient Greeks such as Eudoxus and Archimedes,
and methods for ﬁnding tangents were pioneered by Pierre Fermat (1601–1665), Isaac
Barrow (1630 –1677), and others. Barrow, Newton’s teacher at Cambridge, was the ﬁrst to
understand the inverse relationship between differentiation and integration. What Newton
and Leibniz did was to use this relationship, in the form of the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus, in order to develop calculus into a systematic mathematical discipline. It is in this
sense that Newton and Leibniz are credited with the invention of calculus.
Read about the contributions of these men in one or more of the given references and
write a report on one of the following three topics. You can include biographical details, but
the main thrust of your report should be a description, in some detail, of their methods and
notations. In particular, you should consult one of the sourcebooks, which give excerpts
from the original publications of Newton and Leibniz, translated from Latin to English.

Because of the Fundamental Theorem, it’s important to be able to ﬁnd antiderivatives.
But our antidifferentiation formulas don’t tell us how to evaluate integrals such as
To ﬁnd this integral we use the problem-solving strategy of introducing something
extra. Here the “something extra” is a new variable; we change from the variable x to
a new variable u. Suppose that we let 
be the quantity under the root sign in (1),
. Then the differential of is 
. Notice that if the 
in the nota-
tion for an integral were to be interpreted as a differential, then the differential 
would occur in (1) and, so, formally, without justifying our calculation, we could write
But now we could check that we have the correct answer by using the Chain Rule to
differentiate the ﬁnal function of Equation 2:
In general, this method works whenever we have an integral that we can write in the
form

remember the Substitution Rule is to think of

Thus, the Substitution Rule says: It is permissible to operate with dx and du
after integral signs as if they were differentials.
EXAMPLE 1 Find

SOLUTION We make the substitution 
because its differential is
, which, apart from the constant factor 4, occurs in the integral. Thus,
using 
and the Substitution Rule, we have
Notice that at the ﬁnal stage we had to return to the original variable .
The idea behind the Substitution Rule is to replace a relatively complicated inte-
gral by a simpler integral. This is accomplished by changing from the original vari-
able to a new variable that is a function of . Thus, in Example 1 we replaced the
integral 
by the simpler integral 
.
The main challenge in using the Substitution Rule is to think of an appropriate sub-
stitution. You should try to choose 
to be some function in the integrand whose dif-
ferential also occurs (except for a constant factor). This was the case in Example 1. If
that is not possible, try choosing to be some complicated part of the integrand (per-
haps the inner function in a composite function). Finding the right substitution is a bit

Definite Integrals
When evaluating a deﬁnite integral by substitution, two methods are possible. One
method is to evaluate the indeﬁnite integral ﬁrst and then use the Evaluation Theorem.
For instance, using the result of Example 2, we have

Symmetry
The next theorem uses the Substitution Rule for Deﬁnite Integrals (5) to simplify the
calculation of integrals of functions that possess symmetry properties.
Integrals of Symmetric Functions Suppose 
is continuous on 
.
(a) If f is even 
, then 
.
(b) If f is odd 
, then 
.
Proof We split the integral in two:
In the ﬁrst integral on the far right side we make the substitution 
. Then
and when 
,
. Therefore
and so Equation 7 becomes
(a) If 
is even, then 
so Equation 8 gives 
(b) If 
is odd, then 
and so Equation 8 gives
Theorem 6 is illustrated by Figure 4. For the case where 
is positive and even,
part (a) says that the area under 
from 
to 
is twice the area from 
to 
because of symmetry. Recall that an integral 
can be expressed as the area
above the -axis and below 
minus the area below the axis and above the
curve. Thus, part (b) says the integral is 
because the areas cancel.

Every differentiation rule has a corresponding integration rule. For instance, the Sub-

rule that corresponds to the Product Rule for differentiation is called the rule for inte-
gration by parts.
The Product Rule states that if

to be a function that becomes simpler when differentiated (or at least not
more complicated) as long as

Integration by parts is effective in this example because the derivative of the

We have learned the two basic techniques of integration, substitution and parts, in Sec-
tions 5.5 and 5.6. Here we discuss brieﬂy methods that are special to particular classes
of functions, such as trigonometric functions and rational functions.
Trigonometric Integrals
We can use trigonometric identities to integrate certain combinations of trigonometric
functions.
EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate 
.
SOLUTION We would like to use the Substitution Rule, but simply substituting
isn’t helpful, since then 
. In order to integrate powers 
of cosine, we would need an extra 
factor. Similarly, a power of sine would
require an extra 
factor. Thus, here we separate one cosine factor and convert
the remaining 
factor to an expression involving sine using the identity
:
We can then evaluate the integral by substituting 
, so 
and
In general, we try to write an integrand involving powers of sine and cosine in a
form where we have only one sine factor (and the remainder of the expression in terms
of cosine) or only one cosine factor (and the remainder of the expression in terms of
sine). The identity 
enables us to convert back and forth between
even powers of sine and cosine.
If the integrand contains only even powers of both sine and cosine, however, this
strategy fails. In this case, we can take advantage of the half-angle identities

EXAMPLE 2 Evaluate 
.
SOLUTION If we write 
, the integral is no simpler to evaluate. Using
the half-angle formula for 
, however, we have
Notice that we mentally made the substitution 
when integrating 
. 
Another method for evaluating this integral was given in Exercise 33 in Section 5.6.
We can use a similar strategy to integrate powers of 
using the iden-
tity 
. (See Exercises 7 and 8.)
Trigonometric Substitution
A number of practical problems require us to integrate algebraic functions that con-
tain an expression of the form 
,
, or 
. Sometimes, the best
way to perform the integration is to make a trigonometric substitution that gets rid of
the root sign.
EXAMPLE 3 Prove that the area of a circle with radius is 
.
SOLUTION This is, of course, a well-known formula. You were told that it’s true a long
time ago; but the only way to actually prove it is by integration.
For simplicity, let’s place the circle with its center at the origin, so its equation is
. Solving this equation for , we get
Because the circle is symmetric with respect to both axes, the total area 
is four
times the area in the ﬁrst quadrant (see Figure 2). 
The part of the circle in the ﬁrst quadrant is given by the function
and so

To simplify this integral, we would like to make a substitution that turns 
into the square of something. The trigonometric identity 
is useful
here. In fact, because
we make the substitution
Since 
, we restrict 
so that 
. We have 
and
because 
when 
. Therefore, the Substitution Rule gives
This trigonometric integral is similar to the one in Example 2; we integrate 
by
means of the identity
Thus
We have therefore proved the famous formula 
.
Example 3 suggests that if an integrand contains a factor of the form 
,
then a trigonometric substitution 
may be effective. But that doesn’t mean
that such a substitution is always the best method. To evaluate 
, for in-
stance, a simpler substitution is 
because 
.
When an integral contains an expression of the form 
, the substitution
should be considered because the identity 
eliminates
the root sign. Similarly, if the factor 
occurs, the substitution 
is
effective.
Partial Fractions
We integrate rational functions (ratios of polynomials) by expressing them as sums of
simpler fractions, called partial fractions, that we already know how to integrate. The
following example illustrates the simplest case.

EXAMPLE 4 Find

SOLUTION Notice that the denominator can be factored as a product of linear factors:
In a case like this, where the numerator has a smaller degree than the denominator,
we can write the given rational function as a sum of partial fractions:
where 
are constants. To ﬁnd the values of 
we multiply both sides
of this equation by 
, obtaining
or
The coefﬁcients of must be equal and the constant terms are also equal. So
Solving these linear equations for 
, we get 
, so
Each of the resulting partial fractions is easy to integrate (using the substitutions
and 
, respectively). So we have
NOTE 1
G If the degree in the numerator in Example 4 had been the same as that of
the denominator, or higher, we would have had to take the preliminary step of per-
forming a long division. For instance,
NOTE 2
G If the denominator has more than two linear factors, we need to include a
term corresponding to each factor. For example,
where 
are constants determined by solving a system of three equations in
the unknowns

L Verify that this equation is correct by
taking the fractions on the right side to 
a common denominator.

NOTE 3
G If a linear factor is repeated, we need to include extra terms in the partial
fraction expression. Here’s an example:
NOTE 4
G When we factor a denominator as far as possible, it might happen that we
obtain an irreducible quadratic factor 
, where the discriminant 
is negative. Then the corresponding partial fraction is of the form
where 
are constants to be determined. This term can be integrated by com-
pleting the square and using the formula

Integration Using Tables and Computer Algebra Systems

In this section we describe how to evaluate integrals using tables and computer alge-
bra systems.
Tables of Integrals
Tables of indeﬁnite integrals are very useful when we are confronted by an integral
that is difﬁcult to evaluate by hand and we don’t have access to a computer algebra
system. A relatively brief table of 120 integrals is provided on the Reference Pages at
the back of the book. More extensive tables are available in CRC Standard Mathe-
matical Tables and Formulae, 30th ed. by Daniel Zwillinger (Boca Raton, FL: CRC
Press, 1995) (581 entries) or in Gradshteyn and Ryzhik’s Table of Integrals, Series,
and Products, 6e (New York: Academic Press, 2000), which contains hundreds of
pages of integrals. It should be remembered, however, that integrals do not often occur
in exactly the form listed in a table. Usually we need to use the Substitution Rule or
algebraic simpliﬁcation to transform a given integral into one of the forms in the table.
EXAMPLE 1 Use the Table of Integrals to evaluate 
.
SOLUTION The only formula in the table that resembles our given integral is entry 17:
If we perform long division, we get
Now we can use Formula 17 with 
:
EXAMPLE 2 Use the Table of Integrals to ﬁnd

SOLUTION If we look at the section of the table entitled Forms involving

see that the closest entry is number 34:

This is not exactly what we have, but we will be able to use it if we ﬁrst make the
substitution

SOLUTION If we look in the section called Trigonometric Forms, we see that none of 
the entries explicitly includes a 
factor. However, we can use the reduction for-
mula in entry 84 with 
:
We now need to evaluate 
. We can use the reduction formula in entry 85
with 
, followed by entry 82:
Combining these calculations, we get

but not

The ﬁrst integral is evaluated using the substitution 
:
For the second integral we use Formula 21 with 
:
Thus
Computer Algebra Systems
We have seen that the use of tables involves matching the form of the given integrand
with the forms of the integrands in the tables. Computers are particularly good at
matching patterns. And just as we used substitutions in conjunction with tables, a CAS
can perform substitutions that transform a given integral into one that occurs in its
stored formulas. So it isn’t surprising that computer algebra systems excel at integra-
tion. That doesn’t mean that integration by hand is an obsolete skill. We will see that
a hand computation sometimes produces an indeﬁnite integral in a form that is more
convenient than a machine answer.
To begin, let’s see what happens when we ask a machine to integrate the relatively 
simple function 
. Using the substitution 
, an easy calcula-
tion by hand gives
whereas Derive, Mathematica, and Maple all return the answer
The ﬁrst thing to notice is that computer algebra systems omit the constant of inte-
gration. In other words, they produce a particular antiderivative, not the most general
one. Therefore, when making use of a machine integration, we might have to add a
constant. Second, the absolute value signs are omitted in the machine answer. That is
ﬁne if our problem is concerned only with values of 
greater than . But if we are
interested in other values of , then we need to insert the absolute value symbol.
In the next example we reconsider the integral of Example 4, but this time we ask
a machine for the answer.

This looks different from the answer we found in Example 4, but it is equivalent
because the third term can be rewritten using the identity
Thus
The resulting extra term 
can be absorbed into the constant of 
integration.
Mathematica gives the answer
Mathematica combined the ﬁrst two terms of Example 4 (and the Maple result) into
a single term by factoring.
Derive gives the answer
The ﬁrst term is like the ﬁrst term in the Mathematica answer, and the second term
is identical to the last term in Example 4.
EXAMPLE 6 Use a CAS to evaluate 
.
SOLUTION Maple and Mathematica give the same answer:
It’s clear that both systems must have expanded 
by the Binomial Theorem
and then integrated each term.
If we integrate by hand instead, using the substitution 
, we get
For most purposes, this is a more convenient form of the answer.

L Derive and the TI-89 and TI-92 also
give this answer.
L This is the formula in Problem 9(c) in
the Discovery Project on page 252.

whereas Mathematica produces
We suspect that there are trigonometric identities which show these three answers
are equivalent. Indeed, if we ask Derive, Maple, and Mathematica to simplify their
expressions using trigonometric identities, they ultimately produce the same form of
the answer:
EXAMPLE 8 If 
, ﬁnd the antiderivative F of
such that
. Graph F for 
. Where does F have maximum and minimum
values and inﬂection points?
SOLUTION The antiderivative of
produced by Maple is
and we note that 
. This expression could probably be simpliﬁed, but there’s
no need to do so because a computer algebra system can graph this version of F as
easily as any other version. A graph of F is shown in Figure 1. To locate the max-
imum and minimum values of F we graph its derivative 
in Figure 2 and
observe that F has a local maximum when 
and a local minimum when
. The graph of 
in Figure 2 shows that F has inﬂection points when
, 1.3, 1.8, 2.4, 3.3, and 3.9.
Can We Integrate All Continuous Functions?
The question arises: Will our basic integration formulas, together with the Substitution
Rule, integration by parts, tables of integrals, and computer algebra systems, enable
us to ﬁnd the integral of every continuous function? In particular, can we use it to eval-
uate 
? The answer is No, at least not in terms of the functions that we are famil-
iar with.
Most of the functions that we have been dealing with in this book are what are
called elementary functions. These are the polynomials, rational functions, power
functions 
, exponential functions 
, logarithmic functions, trigonometric and
inverse trigonometric functions, and all functions that can be obtained from these by
the ﬁve operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and composition.
For instance, the function
is an elementary function.
If 
is an elementary function, then 
is an elementary function but 
need
not be an elementary function. Consider 
. Since 
is continuous, its integral
exists, and if we deﬁne the function

in evaluating 
in terms of the functions we know. (In Chapter 8, however, we
will see how to express

There are two situations in which it is impossible to ﬁnd the exact value of a deﬁnite 
integral.
The ﬁrst situation arises from the fact that in order to ﬁnd 
using the Eval-
uation Theorem we need to know an antiderivative of . Sometimes, however, it is dif-
ﬁcult, or even impossible, to ﬁnd an antiderivative (see Section 5.8). For example, it
is impossible to evaluate the following integrals exactly:
The second situation arises when the function is determined from a scientiﬁc exper-
iment through instrument readings or collected data. There may be no formula for the
function (see Example 5).
In both cases we need to ﬁnd approximate values of deﬁnite integrals. We already
know one such method. Recall that the deﬁnite integral is deﬁned as a limit of Rie-
mann sums, so any Riemann sum could be used as an approximation to the integral:
If we divide 
into 
subintervals of equal length

where 
is any point in the th subinterval

is chosen to be the left end-
point of the interval, then 
and we have
If 
, then the integral represents an area and (1) represents an approximation
of this area by the rectangles shown in Figure 1(a). If we choose 
to be the right
endpoint, then 
and we have
[See Figure 1(b).] The approximations 
and 
deﬁned by Equations 1 and 2 are
called the left endpoint approximation and right endpoint approximation.
In Section 5.2 we also considered the case where 
is chosen to be the midpoint
of the subinterval 
. Figure 1(c) shows the midpoint approximation 
,
which appears to be better than either 
or 
.

and
Another approximation, called the Trapezoidal Rule, results from averaging the
approximations in Equations 1 and 2:

In Example 1 we deliberately chose an integral whose value can be computed ex-
plicitly so that we can see how accurate the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules are. By
the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,
The error in using an approximation is deﬁned to be the amount that needs to be added
to the approximation to make it exact. From the values in Example 1 we see that the
errors in the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rule approximations for

In general, we have

Module 5.1/5.2/5.9 allows
you to compare approximation
methods.

We can make several observations from these tables:
1. In all of the methods we get more accurate approximations when we increase
the value of . (But very large values of 
result in so many arithmetic opera-
tions that we have to beware of accumulated round-off error.)
2. The errors in the left and right endpoint approximations are opposite in sign
and appear to decrease by a factor of about 2 when we double the value of .
3. The Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules are much more accurate than the end-
point approximations.
4. The errors in the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules are opposite in sign and
appear to decrease by a factor of about 4 when we double the value of .
5. The size of the error in the Midpoint Rule is about half the size of the error in
the Trapezoidal Rule.
Figure 5 shows why we can usually expect the Midpoint Rule to be more accurate
than the Trapezoidal Rule. The area of a typical rectangle in the Midpoint Rule is the
same as the trapezoid 
whose upper side is tangent to the graph at . The area
of this trapezoid is closer to the area under the graph than is the area of the trapezoid
used in the Trapezoidal Rule. [The midpoint error (shaded red) is smaller than
the trapezoidal error (shaded blue).]
These observations are corroborated in the following error estimates, which are
proved in books on numerical analysis. Notice that Observation 4 corresponds to the
in each denominator because 
. The fact that the estimates depend on the
size of the second derivative is not surprising if you look at Figure 5, because 
measures how much the graph is curved. [Recall that 
measures how fast the
slope of 
changes.]

Therefore, taking

that
Comparing this error estimate of

see that it can happen that the actual error is substantially less than the upper bound
for the error given by (3).

CHAPTER 5 INTEGRALS
L Thomas Simpson was a weaver who
taught himself mathematics and went on
to become one of the best English math-
ematicians of the 18th century. What we
call Simpson’s Rule was actually known 
to Cavalieri and Gregory in the 17th 
century, but Simpson popularized it in 
his best-selling calculus textbook, entitled
A New Treatise of Fluxions.

Notice that, in Example 4, Simpson’s Rule gives us a much better approximation
to the true value of the integral 
than does the
Trapezoidal Rule 
or the Midpoint Rule 
. It turns
out (see Exercise 36) that the approximations in Simpson’s Rule are weighted aver-
ages of those in the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules:
(Recall that 
and 
usually have opposite signs and 
is about half the size 
of 
.)
In many applications of calculus we need to evaluate an integral even if no explicit
formula is known for y as a function of . A function may be given graphically or as
a table of values of collected data. If there is evidence that the values are not chang-
ing rapidly, then the Trapezoidal Rule or Simpson’s Rule can still be used to ﬁnd an
approximate value for 
, the integral of y with respect to . 
EXAMPLE 5 Figure 9 shows data trafﬁc on the link from the U.S. to SWITCH, the
Swiss academic and research network, on February 10, 1998. 
is the data
throughput, measured in megabits per second 
. Use Simpson’s Rule to esti-
mate the total amount of data transmitted to SWITCH up to noon on that day.
SOLUTION Because we want the units to be consistent and 
is measured in mega-
bits per second, we convert the units for from hours to seconds. If we let 
be
the amount of data (in megabits) transmitted by time , where is measured in sec-
onds, then 
. So, by the Total Change Theorem (see Section 5.3), the
total amount of data transmitted by noon (when 
) is
We estimate the values of 
at hourly intervals from the graph and compile them
in the table.

Then we use Simpson’s Rule with 
and 
to estimate the integral:
Thus, the total amount of data transmitted up to noon is about 144,000 megabits, or
144 gigabits.
In Exercise 22 you are asked to demonstrate, in a particular case, that the error in
Simpson’s Rule decreases by a factor of about 16 when 
is doubled. That is consis-
tent with the appearance of 
in the denominator of the following error estimate for
Simpson’s Rule. It is similar to the estimates given in (3) for the Trapezoidal and Mid-
point Rules, but it uses the fourth derivative of .

CHAPTER 5 INTEGRALS
L Many calculators and computer alge-
bra systems have a built-in algorithm that
computes an approximation of a deﬁnite
integral. Some of these machines use
Simpson’s Rule; others use more sophis-
ticated techniques such as adaptive
numerical integration. This means that if 
a function ﬂuctuates much more on a cer-
tain part of the interval than it does else-
where, then that part gets divided into
more subintervals. This strategy reduces
the number of calculations required to
achieve a prescribed accuracy.

EXAMPLE 7
(a) Use Simpson’s Rule with 
to approximate the integral 
.
(b) Estimate the error involved in this approximation.
SOLUTION
(a) If 
, then 
and Simpson’s Rule gives 
(b) The fourth derivative of 
is
and so, since 
, we have
Therefore, putting 
, and 
in (4), we see that the error
is at most
(Compare this with Example 3.) Thus, correct to three decimal places, we have

In deﬁning a deﬁnite integral 
we dealt with a function 
deﬁned on a ﬁnite
interval 
and we assumed that 
does not have an inﬁnite discontinuity (see Sec-
tion 5.2). In this section we extend the concept of a deﬁnite integral to the case where
the interval is inﬁnite and also to the case where 
has an inﬁnite discontinuity in
. In either case the integral is called an improper integral. One of the most impor-
tant applications of this idea, probability distributions, will be studied in Section 6.7.
Type 1: Infinite Intervals
Consider the inﬁnite region that lies under the curve 
, above the -axis, and
to the right of the line 
. You might think that, since is inﬁnite in extent, its area
must be inﬁnite, but let’s take a closer look. The area of the part of 
that lies to the
left of the line 
(shaded in Figure 1) is
Notice that 
no matter how large is chosen.
We also observe that
The area of the shaded region approaches 
as 
(see Figure 2), so we say that
the area of the inﬁnite region 
is equal to 
and we write

Using this example as a guide, we deﬁne the integral of

tive function) over an inﬁnite interval as the limit of integrals over ﬁnite intervals.
Definition of an Improper Integral of Type 1
(a) If

, then
provided this limit exists (as a ﬁnite number).
(b) If 
exists for every number 
, then
provided this limit exists (as a ﬁnite number).
The improper integrals 
and 
are called convergent if the
corresponding limit exists and divergent if the limit does not exist.
(c) If both 
and 
are convergent, then we deﬁne
In part (c) any real number 
can be used (see Exercise 52).
Any of the improper integrals in Deﬁnition 1 can be interpreted as an area provided
that 
is a positive function. For instance, in case (a) if 
and the integral
is convergent, then we deﬁne the area of the region
in Figure 3 to be
This is appropriate because 
is the limit as 
of the area under the graph

The limit does not exist as a ﬁnite number and so the improper integral 
is divergent.
Let’s compare the result of Example 1 with the example given at the beginning of
this section:
Geometrically, this says that although the curves 
and 
look very sim-
ilar for 
, the region under 
to the right of

Figure 4) has ﬁnite area whereas the corresponding region under

Type 2: Discontinuous Integrands
Suppose that 
is a positive continuous function deﬁned on a ﬁnite interval 
but
has a vertical asymptote at . Let be the unbounded region under the graph of 
and
above the -axis between 
and . (For Type 1 integrals, the regions extended indeﬁ-
nitely in a horizontal direction. Here the region is inﬁnite in a vertical direction.) The
area of the part of 
between 
and (the shaded region in Figure 7) is
If it happens that 
approaches a deﬁnite number 
as 
, then we say that
the area of the region 
is 
and we write
We use this equation to deﬁne an improper integral of Type 2 even when 
is not a
positive function, no matter what type of discontinuity 
has at .
Definition of an Improper Integral of Type 2
(a) If 
is continuous on 
and is discontinuous at , then 
if this limit exists (as a ﬁnite number).
(b) If 
is continuous on 
and is discontinuous at , then 
if this limit exists (as a ﬁnite number).
The improper integral 
is called convergent if the corresponding
limit exists and divergent if the limit does not exist.
(c) If 
has a discontinuity at , where 
, and both 
and
are convergent, then we deﬁne

has the vertical asymptote 
. Since the inﬁnite discontinuity occurs at the left

Thus, the given improper integral is convergent and, since the integrand is positive,
we can interpret the value of the integral as the area of the shaded region in Fig-
ure 10.

SOLUTION Note that the given integral is improper because

Using part (a) of Deﬁnition 3 and Formula 14 from the Table of Integrals, we have

is divergent. 
EXAMPLE 7 Evaluate

SOLUTION Observe that the line 
is a vertical asymptote of the integrand. Since 
it occurs in the middle of the interval 
, we must use part (c) of Deﬁnition 3
with

WARNING
G If we had not noticed the asymptote 
in Example 7 and had instead
confused the integral with an ordinary integral, then we might have made the follow-
ing erroneous calculation:
This is wrong because the integral is improper and must be calculated in terms of limits.

From now on, whenever you meet the symbol

integral.

To ﬁnd the limit of the ﬁrst term we use l’Hospital’s Rule:

A Comparison Test for Improper Integrals
Sometimes it is impossible to ﬁnd the exact value of an improper integral and yet it 
is important to know whether it is convergent or divergent. In such cases the follow-
ing theorem is useful. Although we state it for Type 1 integrals, a similar theorem is
true for Type 2 integrals.
Comparison Theorem Suppose that 
and are continuous functions with

(a) If

is convergent.
(b) If 
is divergent, then 
is divergent.
We omit the proof of the Comparison Theorem, but Figure 12 makes it seem plau-
sible. If the area under the top curve 
is ﬁnite, then so is the area under the
bottom curve 
. And if the area under 
is inﬁnite, then so is the area

gent,

may or may not be divergent.]
EXAMPLE 9 Show that 
is convergent.
SOLUTION We can’t evaluate the integral directly because the antiderivative of 
is
not an elementary function (as explained in Section 5.8). We write
and observe that the ﬁrst integral on the right-hand side is just an ordinary deﬁnite
integral. In the second integral we use the fact that for 
we have 
, so
and therefore 
. (See Figure 13.) The integral of 
is easy to
evaluate:
Thus, taking 
and 
in the Comparison Theorem, we see that
is convergent. It follows that 
is convergent.
In Example 9 we showed that 
is convergent without computing its value.
In Exercise 58 we indicate how to show that its value is approximately 0.8862. In
probability theory it is important to know the exact value of this improper integral, as
we will see in Section 6.7; using the methods of multivariable calculus it can be shown
that the exact value is 
. Table 1 illustrates the deﬁnition of an improper integral
by showing how the (computer-generated) values of 
approach 
as 
becomes large. In fact, these values converge quite quickly because 
very
rapidly as 
.
EXAMPLE 10 The integral 
is divergent by the Comparison Theorem
because
and 
is divergent by Example 1 [or by (2) with 
].
Table 2 illustrates the divergence of the integral in Example 10. Notice that the val-
ues do not approach any ﬁxed number.

Before you look at the solution of the following example, cover it up and ﬁrst try to
solve the problem yourself.
EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate 
.
SOLUTION Let’s start by having a preliminary look at the ingredients of the function.
What happens to the ﬁrst factor,
, when approaches ? The numerator
approaches 
and the denominator approaches , so we have
and
The second factor approaches 
, which is . It’s not clear what happens
to the function as a whole. (One factor is becoming large while the other is becom-
ing small.) So how do we proceed?
One of the principles of problem solving is recognizing something familiar. Is
there a part of the function that reminds us of something we’ve seen before? Well,
the integral
has as its upper limit of integration and that type of integral occurs in Part 1 of
the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:
This suggests that differentiation might be involved.
Once we start thinking about differentiation, the denominator 
reminds
us of something else that should be familiar: One of the forms of the deﬁnition of
the derivative in Chapter 2 is
and with 
this becomes
So what is the function 
in our situation? Notice that if we deﬁne

SOLUTION
(a) At ﬁrst sight, the given equation may appear somewhat bafﬂing. How is it
possible to connect the left side to the right side? Connections can often be made
through one of the principles of problem solving: introduce something extra. Here
the extra ingredient is a new variable. We often think of introducing a new variable
when we use the Substitution Rule to integrate a speciﬁc function. But that tech-
nique is still useful in the present circumstance in which we have a general func-
tion .
Once we think of making a substitution, the form of the right side suggests that
it should be 
. Then 
. When 
,
; when 
,
.
So 
But this integral on the right side is just another way of writing 
. So the
given equation is proved.
(b) If we let the given integral be and apply part (a) with 
, we get
A well-known trigonometric identity tells us that 
and
, so we get
Notice that the two expressions for are very similar. In fact, the integrands have
the same denominator. This suggests that we should add the two expressions. If we
do so, we get
Therefore,

In Chapter 5 we deﬁned and calculated areas of regions that lie under the graphs of 
functions. Here we use integrals to ﬁnd areas of more general regions. First we con-
sider regions that lie between the graphs of two functions. Then we look at regions
enclosed by parametric curves.
Areas between Curves
Consider the region 
that lies between two curves 
and 
and be-
tween the vertical lines 
and 
, where 
and are continuous functions and
for all in 
. (See Figure 1.)
Just as we did for areas under curves in Section 5.1, we divide S into n strips of
equal width and then we approximate the ith strip by a rectangle with base 
and
height 
. (See Figure 2. If we like, we could take all of the sample points
to be right endpoints, in which case 
.) The Riemann sum
is therefore an approximation to what we intuitively think of as the area of S.
This approximation appears to become better and better as 
. Therefore, we
deﬁne the area
of 
as the limiting value of the sum of the areas of these approxi-
mating rectangles.

In this chapter we explore some of the applications of
the deﬁnite integral by using it to compute areas be-
tween curves, volumes of solids, lengths of curves, the
average value of a function, the work done by a vary-
ing force, the center of gravity of a plate, the force on
a dam, as well as quantities of interest in biology, eco-
nomics, and statistics. The common theme in most of
these applications is the following general method,
which is similar to the one we used to ﬁnd areas 
under curves. We break up a quantity 
into a large
number of small parts. We then approximate each
small part by a quantity of the form 
and thus
approximate 
by a Riemann sum. Then we take the
limit and express 
as an integral. Finally, we evalu-
ate the integral by using the Evaluation Theorem or
Simpson’s Rule.

We recognize the limit in (1) as the deﬁnite integral of 
. Therefore, we have
the following formula for area.
The area 
of the region bounded by the curves 
, and the
lines 
,
, where 
and are continuous and 
for all in
, is
Notice that in the special case where 
,
is the region under the graph of 
and our general deﬁnition of area (1) reduces to our previous deﬁnition (Deﬁnition
5.1.2).
In the case where both 
and are positive, you can see from Figure 3 why (2) is
true:
EXAMPLE 1 Find the area of the region bounded above by 
, bounded below by
, and bounded on the sides by 
and 
.
SOLUTION The region is shown in Figure 4. The upper boundary curve is 
and
the lower boundary curve is 
. So we use the area formula (2) with 
,
,
and 
:
In Figure 4 we drew a typical approximating rectangle with width 
as a reminder
of the procedure by which the area is deﬁned in (1). In general, when we set up an
integral for an area, it’s helpful to sketch the region to identify the top curve 
, the
bottom curve 
, and a typical approximating rectangle as in Figure 5. Then the area
of a typical rectangle is 
and the equation
summarizes the procedure of adding (in a limiting sense) the areas of all the typical 
rectangles.
Notice that in Figure 5 the left-hand boundary reduces to a point, whereas in Fig-
ure 3 the right-hand boundary reduces to a point. In the next example both of the side
boundaries reduce to a point, so the ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd a and b.

equations simultaneously. This gives

We see from Figure 6 that the top and bottom boundaries are

The area of a typical rectangle is
and the region lies between 
and

Sometimes it’s difﬁcult, or even impossible, to ﬁnd the points of intersection of two
curves exactly. As shown in the following example, we can use a graphing calculator
or computer to ﬁnd approximate values for the intersection points and then proceed as
before.
EXAMPLE 3 Find the approximate area of the region bounded by the curves
and 
SOLUTION If we were to try to ﬁnd the exact intersection points, we would have to
solve the equation
This looks like a very difﬁcult equation to solve exactly (in fact, it’s impossible), so
instead we use a graphing device to draw the graphs of the two curves in Figure 7.
One intersection point is the origin. We zoom in toward the other point of intersec-
tion and ﬁnd that 
. (If greater accuracy is required, we could use Newton’s
method or a rootﬁnder, if available on our graphing device.) Thus, an approximation
to the area between the curves is

EXAMPLE 4 Figure 8 shows velocity curves for two cars, A and B, that start side by
side and move along the same road. What does the area between the curves repre-
sent? Use Simpson’s Rule to estimate it.
SOLUTION We know from Section 5.3 that the area under the velocity curve A repre-
sents the distance traveled by car A during the ﬁrst 16 seconds. Similarly, the area
under curve B is the distance traveled by car B during that time period. So the area
between these curves, which is the difference of the areas under the curves, is the
distance between the cars after 16 seconds. We read the velocities from the graph
and convert them to feet per second 
.
Using Simpson’s Rule with 
intervals, so that 
, we estimate the dis-
tance between the cars after 16 seconds:
Some regions are best treated by regarding x as a function of y. If a region is
bounded by curves with equations

EXAMPLE 5 Find the area enclosed by the line 
and the parabola
.
SOLUTION By solving the two equations we ﬁnd that the points of intersection are
and 
. We solve the equation of the parabola for x and notice from
Figure 11 that the left and right boundary curves are
We must integrate between the appropriate -values,
and 
. Thus
We could have found the area in Example 5 by integrating with respect to x instead
of y, but the calculation is much more involved. It would have meant splitting the
region in two and computing the areas labeled 
and 
in Figure 12. The method we
used in Example 5 is much easier.
Areas Enclosed by Parametric Curves
We know that the area under a curve 
from 
to 
is 
, where
. If the curve is given by the parametric equations 
and 
,
, then we can calculate an area formula by using the Substitution Rule for
Deﬁnite Integrals as follows:

In trying to ﬁnd the volume of a solid we face the same type of problem as in ﬁnding
areas. We have an intuitive idea of what volume means, but we must make this idea
precise by using calculus to give an exact deﬁnition of volume.
We start with a simple type of solid called a cylinder (or, more precisely, a right
cylinder). As illustrated in Figure 1(a), a cylinder is bounded by a plane region 
,
B1
6.2

called the base, and a congruent region 
in a parallel plane. The cylinder consists of
all points on line segments perpendicular to the base that join 
to 
. If the area of
the base is 
and the height of the cylinder (the distance from 
to 
) is , then the
volume 
of the cylinder is deﬁned as
In particular, if the base is a circle with radius , then the cylinder is a circular cylin-
der with volume 
[see Figure 1(b)], and if the base is a rectangle with length
and width , then the cylinder is a rectangular box (also called a rectangular paral-
lelepiped) with volume 
[see Figure 1(c)].
For a solid S that isn’t a cylinder we ﬁrst “cut” S into pieces and approximate each
piece by a cylinder. We estimate the volume of S by adding the volumes of the cylin-
ders. We arrive at the exact volume of S though a limiting process in which the num-
ber of pieces becomes large.
We start by intersecting S with a plane and obtaining a plane region that is called a
cross-section of 
Let 
be the area of the cross-section of in a plane 
perpen-
dicular to the -axis and passing through the point , where 
. (See Figure 2.
Think of slicing 
with a knife through 
and computing the area of this slice.) The
cross-sectional area 
will vary as increases from 
to .
Let’s divide S into n “slabs” of equal width 
by using the planes 
,
, . . . to
slice the solid. (Think of slicing a loaf of bread.) If we choose sample points 
in
, we can approximate the 
slab 
(the part of that lies between the planes
and 
) by a cylinder with base area 
and “height”
. (See Figure 3.)

The volume of this cylinder is 
, so an approximation to our intuitive con-
ception of the volume of the th slab 
is 
Adding the volumes of these slabs, we get an approximation to the total volume (that
is, what we think of intuitively as the volume):
This approximation appears to become better and better as 
. (Think of the slices
as becoming thinner and thinner.) Therefore, we deﬁne the volume as the limit of these
sums as 
. But we recognize the limit of Riemann sums as a deﬁnite integral and
so we have the following deﬁnition.
Definition of Volume Let 
be a solid that lies between 
and 
. If the
cross-sectional area of 
in the plane 
, through x and perpendicular to the 
x-axis, is 
, where 
is a continuous function, then the volume of

When we use the volume formula 
it is important to remember that 
is the area of a moving cross-section obtained by slicing through 
perpendicu-
lar to the -axis.
EXAMPLE 1 Show that the volume of a sphere of radius is
SOLUTION If we place the sphere so that its center is at the origin (see Figure 4), then
the plane 
intersects the sphere in a circle whose radius (from the Pythagorean
Theorem) is 
. So the cross-sectional area is

(The integrand is even.)
Figure 5 illustrates the deﬁnition of volume when the solid is a sphere with radius 
. From the result of Example 1, we know that the volume of the sphere is
. Here the slabs are circular cylinders (disks) and the three parts of Fig-
ure 5 show the geometric interpretations of the Riemann sums
when 
, 10, and 20 if we choose the sample points 
to be the midpoints .
Notice that as we increase the number of approximating cylinders, the corresponding
Riemann sums become closer to the true volume.
EXAMPLE 2 Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating about the x-axis the
region under the curve 
from 0 to 1. Illustrate the deﬁnition of volume by
sketching a typical approximating cylinder.
SOLUTION The region is shown in Figure 6(a). If we rotate about the x-axis, we get the
solid shown in Figure 6(b). When we slice through the point x, we get a disk with
radius 
. The area of this cross-section is
and the volume of the approximating cylinder (a disk with thickness 
) is
The solid lies between

let’s replace the given region by a

solid perpendicular to the y-axis and therefore to integrate with respect to y. If we

CHAPTER 6 APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION

The solids in Examples 1–5 are all called solids of revolution because they are
obtained by revolving a region about a line. In general, we calculate the volume of a
solid of revolution by using the basic deﬁning formula
and we ﬁnd the cross-sectional area 
or 
in one of the following ways:
I
If the cross-section is a disk (as in Examples 1–3), we ﬁnd the radius of the
disk (in terms of x or y) and use
I
If the cross-section is a washer (as in Examples 4 and 5), we ﬁnd the inner
radius 
and outer radius 
from a sketch (as in Figures 9 and 10) and
compute the area of the washer by subtracting the area of the inner disk
from the area of the outer disk:
The next example gives a further illustration of the procedure.

Since

that its height is

SOLUTION We place the origin 
at the vertex of the pyramid and the -axis along its
central axis as in Figure 14. Any plane 
that passes through and is perpendicular
to the -axis intersects the pyramid in a square with side of length , say. We can
express in terms of by observing from the similar triangles in Figure 15 that

has slope 
and so its equation is 
.] Thus, the cross-sectional area is
The pyramid lies between 
and 
, so its volume is
NOTE
G We didn’t need to place the vertex of the pyramid at the origin in Example 8.
We did so merely to make the equations simple. If, instead, we had placed the center
of the base at the origin and the vertex on the positive -axis, as in Figure 16, you can

Cylindrical Shells
Some volume problems are very difﬁcult to handle by the slicing methods that we
have used so far. For instance, let’s consider the problem of ﬁnding the volume of 
the solid obtained by rotating about the -axis the region bounded by the curve
and the -axis (see Figure 17). If we slice, then we run into a severe
problem. To compute the inner radius and the outer radius of a cross-section, we
would have to solve the cubic equation 
for x in terms of y; that’s not
easy. Fortunately, there is a method, called the method of cylindrical shells, that is
easier to use in such a case. We illustrate it in the next example.
EXAMPLE 9 Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating about the -axis the
region bounded by the curve 
and the -axis.
SOLUTION Instead of slicing, we approximate the solid using cylindrical shells. Fig-
ure 18 shows a typical approximating rectangle with width 
. If we rotate this
rectangle about the -axis, we get a cylindrical shell whose average radius is , the
midpoint of the th subinterval.
Imagine this shell to be cut and ﬂattened, as in Figure 19. The resulting rectan-
gular slab has dimensions 
,
, and 
so the volume of the shell is

If we do this for every subinterval and add the results, we get an approximation to
the volume of the solid:
This approximation improves as increases, so it seems plausible that
It can be veriﬁed that the method of shells gives the same answer as slicing.

Rotating on a Slant
We know how to ﬁnd the volume of a solid of revolution obtained by rotating a region
about a horizontal or vertical line (see Section 6.2). But what if we rotate about a slanted
line, that is, a line that is neither horizontal nor vertical? In this project you are asked to
discover a formula for the volume of a solid of revolution when the axis of rotation is a
slanted line.
Let 
be the arc of the curve 
between the points 
and 
and
let 
be the region bounded by , by the line 
(which lies entirely below ),
and by the perpendiculars to the line from 
and .

[Hint: This formula can be veriﬁed by subtracting areas, but it will be helpful throughout
the project to derive it by ﬁrst approximating the area using rectangles perpendicular to

What do we mean by the length of a curve? We might think of ﬁtting a piece of string
to the curve in Figure 1 and then measuring the string against a ruler. But that might
be difﬁcult to do with much accuracy if we have a complicated curve. We need a pre-
cise deﬁnition for the length of an arc of a curve, in the same spirit as the deﬁnitions
we developed for the concepts of area and volume.
If the curve is a polygon, we can easily ﬁnd its length; we just add the lengths of
the line segments that form the polygon. (We can use the distance formula to ﬁnd the
distance between the endpoints of each segment.) We are going to deﬁne the length of
a general curve by ﬁrst approximating it by a polygon and then taking a limit as the
number of segments of the polygon is increased. This process is familiar for the case
of a circle, where the circumference is the limit of lengths of inscribed polygons (see
Figure 2).
Suppose that a curve 
is described by the parametric equations
Let’s assume that 
is smooth in the sense that the derivatives 
and 
are con-
tinuous and not simultaneously zero for 
. (This ensures that 
has no sud-
den change in direction.) We divide the parameter interval 
into subintervals of
equal width 
. If 
,
,
, . . . ,
are the endpoints of these subintervals, then
and 
are the coordinates of points 
that lie on 
and the
polygon with vertices 
,
, . . . ,
approximates . (See Figure 3.) The length L of
is approximately the length of this polygon and the approximation gets better as we
let n increase. (See Figure 4, where the arc of the curve between 
and 
has been
magniﬁed and approximations with successively smaller values of 
are shown.)
Therefore, we deﬁne the length of 
to be the limit of the lengths of these inscribed
polygons:
Notice that the procedure for deﬁning arc length is very similar to the procedure
we used for deﬁning area and volume: We divided the curve into a large number of
small parts. We then found the approximate lengths of the small parts and added them.
Finally, we took the limit as 
.
For computational purposes we need a more convenient expression for . If we let
and 
, then the length of the th line segment of the
polygon is

This is a Riemann sum for the function

If we are given a curve with equation 
,
, then we can regard 
as a parameter. Then parametric equations are 
,
, and Formula 1
becomes
Similarly, if a curve has the equation 
,
, we regard as the param-
eter and the length is
Because of the presence of the root sign in Formulas 1, 2, and 3, the calculation of
an arc length often leads to an integral that is very difﬁcult or even impossible to eval-
uate explicitly. Thus, we often have to be content with ﬁnding an approximation to the
length of a curve as in the following example.
EXAMPLE 2 Estimate the length of the portion of the hyperbola 
from the point
to the point 
.
SOLUTION We have
and so, from Formula 2, the length is
It is impossible to evaluate this integral exactly, so let’s use Simpson’s Rule (see

It is easy to calculate the average value of ﬁnitely many numbers 
,
, . . . ,
:
But how do we compute the average temperature during a day if inﬁnitely many tem-
perature readings are possible? Figure 1 shows the graph of a temperature function
, where is measured in hours and 
in C, and a guess at the average tempera-
ture,
.
In general, let’s try to compute the average value of a function 
,
We start by dividing the interval 
into 
equal subintervals, each with length
. Then we choose points 
, . . . ,
in successive subintervals and
calculate the average of the numbers 
, . . . ,
:
(For example, if 
represents a temperature function and 
, this means that we
take temperature readings every hour and then average them.) Since 
,
we can write 
and the average value becomes
If we let 
increase, we would be computing the average value of a large number of
closely spaced values. (For example, we would be averaging temperature readings
taken every minute or even every second.) The limiting value is
by the deﬁnition of a deﬁnite integral.
Therefore, we deﬁne the average value of
on the interval 
as

SOLUTION With

If 
is the temperature at time , we might wonder if there is a speciﬁc time when
the temperature is the same as the average temperature. For the temperature function
graphed in Figure 1, we see that there are two such times––just before noon and just
before midnight. In general, is there a number at which the value of a function 
is
exactly equal to the average value of the function, that is,
? The following
theorem says that this is true for continuous functions. 
The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals If 
is continuous on 
, then there exists
a number in 
such that
that is,
The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals is a consequence of the Mean Value Theo-
rem for derivatives and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The proof is outlined
in Exercise 17.
The geometric interpretation of the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals is that, for
positive functions , there is a number 
such that the rectangle with base 
and
height 
has the same area as the region under the graph of 
from to (see Fig-
ure 2 and the more picturesque interpretation in the margin note).
EXAMPLE 2 Since 
is continuous on the interval 
, the Mean
Value Theorem for Integrals says there is a number in 
such that
In this particular case we can ﬁnd explicitly. From Example 1 we know that
, so the value of c satisﬁes
Therefore
Thus, in this case there happen to be two numbers 
in the interval 
that work in the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals.
Examples 1 and 2 are illustrated by Figure 3.

Where to Sit at the Movies
A movie theater has a screen that is positioned 10 ft off the ﬂoor and is 25 ft high. The ﬁrst
row of seats is placed 9 ft from the screen and the rows are set 3 ft apart. The ﬂoor of the
seating area is inclined at an angle of 
above the horizontal and the distance up the
incline that you sit is . The theater has 21 rows of seats, so 
. Suppose you
decide that the best place to sit is in the row where the angle 
subtended by the screen 
at your eyes is a maximum. Let’s also suppose that your eyes are 4 ft above the ﬂoor, as
shown in the ﬁgure. (In Exercise 40 in Section 4.6 we looked at a simpler version of this
problem, where the ﬂoor is horizontal, but this project involves a more complicated situation
and requires technology.)

Among the many applications of integral calculus to physics and engineering, we con-
sider three: work, force due to water pressure, and centers of mass. As with our pre-
vious applications to geometry (areas, volumes, and lengths), our strategy is to break
up the physical quantity into a large number of small parts, approximate each small
part, add the results, take the limit, and evaluate the resulting integral.

Work
The term work is used in everyday language to mean the total amount of effort
required to perform a task. In physics it has a technical meaning that depends on the
idea of a force. Intuitively, you can think of a force as describing a push or pull on an
object—for example, a horizontal push of a book across a table or the downward pull
of Earth’s gravity on a ball. In general, if an object moves along a straight line with
position function 
, then the force F on the object (in the same direction) is deﬁned
by Newton’s Second Law of Motion as the product of its mass 
and its acceleration:
In the SI metric system, the mass is measured in kilograms (kg), the displacement in
meters (m), the time in seconds (s), and the force in newtons (
). Thus, a
force of 1 N acting on a mass of 1 kg produces an acceleration of 1 m	s . In the U.S.
Customary system the fundamental unit is chosen to be the unit of force, which is the
pound.
In the case of constant acceleration, the force 
is also constant and the work done
is deﬁned to be the product of the force 
and the distance 
that the object moves:
If 
is measured in newtons and 
in meters, then the unit for 
is a newton-meter,
which is called a joule (J). If 
is measured in pounds and 
in feet, then the unit for
is a foot-pound (ft-lb), which is about 1.36 J.
For instance, suppose you lift a 1.2-kg book off the ﬂoor to put it on a desk that is
0.7 m high. The force you exert is equal and opposite to that exerted by gravity, so
Equation 1 gives
and then Equation 2 gives the work done as
But if a 20-lb weight is lifted 6 ft off the ground, then the force is given as 
lb,
so the work done is
Here we didn’t multiply by because we were given the weight (a force) and not the
mass.
Equation 2 deﬁnes work as long as the force is constant, but what happens if the
force is variable? Let’s suppose that the object moves along the -axis in the positive
direction, from 
to 
, and at each point between and a force 
acts
on the object, where 
is a continuous function. We divide the interval 
into n
subintervals with endpoints 
and equal width 
. We choose a sample
point 
in the th subinterval 
. Then the force at that point is 
. If 
is
large, then 
is small, and since 
is continuous, the values of 
don’t change very
much over the interval 
. In other words,
is almost constant on the interval

and so the work 
that is done in moving the particle from 
to 
is approximately
given by Equation 2:
Thus, we can approximate the total work by
It seems that this approximation becomes better as we make 
larger. Therefore, we
deﬁne the work done in moving the object from a to b as the limit of this quantity
as 
. Since the right side of (3) is a Riemann sum, we recognize its limit as being
a deﬁnite integral and so
EXAMPLE 1 When a particle is located at a distance feet from the origin, a force 
of 
pounds acts on it. How much work is done in moving it from 
to 
?
SOLUTION
The work done is 
ft-lb.
In the next example we use a law from physics: Hooke’s Law states that the force
required to maintain a spring stretched units beyond its natural length is proportional 
to :
where 
is a positive constant (called the spring constant). Hooke’s Law holds pro-
vided that is not too large (see Figure 1).
EXAMPLE 2 A force of 40 N is required to hold a spring that has been stretched from
its natural length of 10 cm to a length of 15 cm. How much work is done in stretch-
ing the spring from 15 cm to 18 cm?
SOLUTION According to Hooke’s Law, the force required to hold the spring stretched 
meters beyond its natural length is 
. When the spring is stretched 
from 10 cm to 15 cm, the amount stretched is 
cm
m. This means that
so
Thus,
and the work done in stretching the spring from 15 cm to 18 cm is

EXAMPLE 3 A tank has the shape of an inverted circular cone with height 10 m and
base radius 4 m. It is ﬁlled with water to a height of 8 m. Find the work required to
empty the tank by pumping all of the water to the top of the tank. (The density of
water is 1000 kg	m .)
SOLUTION Let’s measure depths from the top of the tank by introducing a vertical
coordinate line as in Figure 2. The water extends from a depth of 2 m to a depth 
of 10 m and so we divide the interval 
into n subintervals with endpoints
and choose 
in the th subinterval. This divides the water into 
layers. The th layer is approximated by a circular cylinder with radius 
and height
. We can compute 
from similar triangles, using Figure 3, as follows:
Thus, an approximation to the volume of the th layer of water is
and so its mass is
The force required to raise this layer must overcome the force of gravity and so
Each particle in the layer must travel a distance of approximately
. The work
done to raise this layer to the top is approximately the product of the force
and the
distance
:
To ﬁnd the total work done in emptying the entire tank, we add the contributions of
each of the 
layers and then take the limit as 
:
Hydrostatic Pressure and Force
Deep-sea divers realize that water pressure increases as they dive deeper. This is
because the weight of the water above them increases.
In general, suppose that a thin horizontal plate with area 
square meters is sub-
merged in a ﬂuid of density kilograms per cubic meter at a depth meters below the
surface of the ﬂuid as in Figure 4. The ﬂuid directly above the plate has volume
, so its mass is 
. The force exerted by the ﬂuid on the plate is

therefore
where is the acceleration due to gravity. The pressure 
on the plate is deﬁned to be
the force per unit area:
The SI unit for measuring pressure is newtons per square meter, which is called a pas-
cal (abbreviation: 1 N	m
Pa). Since this is a small unit, the kilopascal (kPa) is
often used. For instance, because the density of water is 
kg	m , the pres-
sure at the bottom of a swimming pool 2 m deep is
An important principle of ﬂuid pressure is the experimentally veriﬁed fact that at
any point in a liquid the pressure is the same in all directions. (A diver feels the same
pressure on nose and both ears.) Thus, the pressure in any direction at a depth 
in a
ﬂuid with mass density 
is given by
This helps us determine the hydrostatic force against a vertical plate or wall or dam
in a ﬂuid. This is not a straightforward problem, because the pressure is not constant
but increases as the depth increases.
EXAMPLE 4 A dam has the shape of the trapezoid shown in Figure 5. The height is
20 m and the width is 50 m at the top and 30 m at the bottom. Find the force on the 
dam due to hydrostatic pressure if the water level is 4 m from the top of the dam.
SOLUTION We choose a vertical -axis with origin at the surface of the water as in
Figure 6(a). The depth of the water is 16 m, so we divide the interval 
into 
subintervals of equal length with endpoints 
and we choose 
. The 
horizontal strip of the dam is approximated by a rectangle with height 
and width
, where, from similar triangles in Figure 6(b),
or
and so
If 
is the area of the 
strip, then
If 
is small, then the pressure 
on the 
strip is almost constant and we can use

The hydrostatic force 
acting on the

Adding these forces and taking the limit as

force on the dam:
Moments and Centers of Mass
Our main objective here is to ﬁnd the point 
on which a thin plate of any given shape
balances horizontally as in Figure 7. This point is called the center of mass (or cen-
ter of gravity) of the plate.
We ﬁrst consider the simpler situation illustrated in Figure 8, where two masses 
and 
are attached to a rod of negligible mass on opposite sides of a fulcrum and at
distances 
and 
from the fulcrum. The rod will balance if
This is an experimental fact discovered by Archimedes and called the Law of the Lever.
(Think of a lighter person balancing a heavier one on a seesaw by sitting farther away
from the center.)
Now suppose that the rod lies along the -axis with 
at 
and 
at 
and the
center of mass at . If we compare Figures 8 and 9, we see that 
and
and so Equation 5 gives
The numbers 
and 
are called the moments of the masses 
and 
(with
respect to the origin), and Equation 6 says that the center of mass 
is obtained by
adding the moments of the masses and dividing by the total mass 
.

In general, if we have a system of 
particles with masses 
,
. . . ,
located
at the points 
,
. . . ,
on the -axis, it can be shown similarly that the center of
mass of the system is located at
where 
is the total mass of the system, and the sum of the individual
moments
is called the moment of the system with respect to the origin. Then Equation 7 could
be rewritten as 
, which says that if the total mass were considered as being
concentrated at the center of mass , then its moment would be the same as the
moment of the system.
Now we consider a system of particles with masses 
,
. . . ,
located at the
points 
,
, . . . ,
in the 
-plane as shown in Figure 10. By anal-
ogy with the one-dimensional case, we deﬁne the moment of the system about the
y-axis to be
and the moment of the system about the x-axis as
Then 
measures the tendency of the system to rotate about the -axis and 
meas-
ures the tendency to rotate about the -axis.
As in the one-dimensional case, the coordinates 
of the center of mass are
given in terms of the moments by the formulas
where 
is the total mass. Since 
and 
, the center of mass 
is the point where a single particle of mass 
would have the same moments as
the system.
EXAMPLE 5 Find the moments and center of mass of the system of objects that have
masses 3, 4, and 8 at the points 
,
, and 
.
SOLUTION We use Equations 8 and 9 to compute the moments:

Since 
, we use Equations 10 to obtain
Thus, the center of mass is 
. (See Figure 11.)
Next we consider a ﬂat plate (called a lamina) with uniform density 
that occu-
pies a region 
of the plane. We wish to locate the center of mass of the plate, which
is called the centroid of 
. In doing so we use the following physical principles: The
symmetry principle says that if 
is symmetric about a line , then the centroid of 
lies on . (If 
is reﬂected about , then 
remains the same so its centroid remains
ﬁxed. But the only ﬁxed points lie on .) Thus, the centroid of a rectangle is its center.
Moments should be deﬁned so that if the entire mass of a region is concentrated at the
center of mass, then its moments remain unchanged. Also, the moment of the union
of two nonoverlapping regions should be the sum of the moments of the individual
regions.
Suppose that the region 
is of the type shown in Figure 12(a); that is,
lies
between the lines 
and 
, above the -axis, and beneath the graph of ,
where is a continuous function. We divide the interval 
into n subintervals with
endpoints 
and equal width 
. We choose the sample point 
to be the
midpoint 
of the 
subinterval, that is,
. This determines the
polygonal approximation to 
shown in Figure 12(b). The centroid of the 
approx-
imating rectangle 
is its center 
. Its area is 
, so its mass is
The moment of 
about the -axis is the product of its mass and the distance from 
to the -axis, which is 
Adding these moments, we obtain the moment of the polygonal approximation to 
, and then by taking the limit as 
we obtain the moment of 
itself about the 
-axis:
In a similar fashion we compute the moment of 
about the -axis as the product
of its mass and the distance from 
to the -axis:
Again we add these moments and take the limit to obtain the moment of 
about the 
-axis:

Just as for systems of particles, the center of mass of the plate is deﬁned so that

area:
and so
Notice the cancellation of the ’s. The location of the center of mass is independent
of the density.
In summary, the center of mass of the plate (or the centroid of

point

SECTION 6.6 APPLICATIONS TO ECONOMICS AND BIOLOGY

In this section we consider some applications of integration to economics (consumer
surplus) and biology (blood ﬂow, cardiac output). Others are described in the exercises.
Consumer Surplus
Recall from Section 4.7 that the demand function 
is the price that a company has
to charge in order to sell 
units of a commodity. Usually, selling larger quantities
requires lowering prices, so the demand function is a decreasing function. The graph
of a typical demand function, called a demand curve, is shown in Figure 1. If 
is the
amount of the commodity that is currently available, then 
is the current sell-
ing price.
We divide the interval 
into subintervals, each of length 
, and let
be the right endpoint of the 
subinterval, as in Figure 2. If, after the ﬁrst
units were sold, a total of only 
units had been available and the price per unit
had been set at 
dollars, then the additional 
units could have been sold (but no
more). The consumers who would have paid 
dollars placed a high value on the
product; they would have paid what it was worth to them. So, in paying only 
dol-
lars they have saved an amount of
Considering similar groups of willing consumers for each of the subintervals and
adding the savings, we get the total savings:
(This sum corresponds to the area enclosed by the rectangles in Figure 2.) If we let
, this Riemann sum approaches the integral
which economists call the consumer surplus for the commodity.

Blood Flow
In Example 7 in Section 3.3 we discussed the law of laminar ﬂow:
which gives the velocity of blood that ﬂows along a blood vessel with radius 
and
length 
at a distance 
from the central axis, where 
is the pressure difference
between the ends of the vessel and 
is the viscosity of the blood. Now, in order to
compute the rate of blood ﬂow, or ﬂux (volume per unit time), we consider smaller,
equally spaced radii 
. . . . The approximate area of the ring (or washer) with
inner radius 
and outer radius 
is
where
(See Figure 4.) If 
is small, then the velocity is almost constant throughout this ring
and can be approximated by 
. Thus, the volume of blood per unit time that ﬂows
across the ring is approximately

and the total volume of blood that ﬂows across a cross-section per unit time is about
This approximation is illustrated in Figure 5. Notice that the velocity (and hence the
volume per unit time) increases toward the center of the blood vessel. The approxi-
mation gets better as n increases. When we take the limit we get the exact value of the
ﬂux (or discharge), which is the volume of blood that passes a cross-section per unit
time:
The resulting equation
is called Poiseuille’s Law; it shows that the ﬂux is proportional to the fourth power of
the radius of the blood vessel.
Cardiac Output
Figure 6 shows the human cardiovascular system. Blood returns from the body through
the veins, enters the right atrium of the heart, and is pumped to the lungs through the
pulmonary arteries for oxygenation. It then ﬂows back into the left atrium through the
pulmonary veins and then out to the rest of the body through the aorta. The cardiac
output of the heart is the volume of blood pumped by the heart per unit time, that is,
the rate of ﬂow into the aorta.

The dye dilution method is used to measure the cardiac output. Dye is injected into
the right atrium and ﬂows through the heart into the aorta. A probe inserted into the
aorta measures the concentration of the dye leaving the heart at equally spaced times
over a time interval 
until the dye has cleared. Let 
be the concentration of
the dye at time . If we divide 
into subintervals of equal length 
, then the
amount of dye that ﬂows past the measuring point during the subinterval from 
to

where 
is the rate of ﬂow that we are trying to determine. Thus, the total amount of

is known and the integral can be approximated from the
concentration readings.

supply and demand curves and identifying the surpluses as
areas.
; 9. A company modeled the demand curve for its product (in
dollars) by
Use a graph to estimate the sales level when the selling
price is $16. Then ﬁnd (approximately) the consumer
surplus for this sales level.
A movie theater has been charging $7.50 per person and
selling about 400 tickets on a typical weeknight. After sur-
veying their customers, the theater estimates that for every
50 cents that they lower the price, the number of movie-
goers will increase by 35 per night. Find the demand func-
tion and calculate the consumer surplus when the tickets 
are priced at $6.00.
11. If the amount of capital that a company has at time is 
,
then the derivative,
, is called the net investment ﬂow.
Suppose that the net investment ﬂow is 
million dollars
per year (where is measured in years). Find the increase in
capital (the capital formation) from the fourth year to the
eighth year. 
12. A hot, wet summer is causing a mosquito population explo-
sion in a lake resort area. The number of mosquitos is
increasing at an estimated rate of 
per week
(where is measured in weeks). By how much does the
mosquito population increase between the ﬁfth and ninth
weeks of summer?
13. Use Poiseuille’s Law to calculate the rate of ﬂow in a small
human artery where we can take 
,
cm,
cm, and 
dynes	cm .
14. High blood pressure results from constriction of the arteries.
To maintain a normal ﬂow rate (ﬂux), the heart has to pump
harder, thus increasing the blood pressure. Use Poiseuille’s
Law to show that if 
and 
are normal values of the
radius and pressure in an artery and the constricted values
are 
and , then for the ﬂux to remain constant,
and 
are related by the equation
Deduce that if the radius of an artery is reduced to three-
fourths of its former value, then the pressure is more than
tripled.

Some producers would be willing to make and sell the com-

Calculus plays a role in the analysis of random behavior. Suppose we consider the
cholesterol level of a person chosen at random from a certain age group, or the height
of an adult female chosen at random, or the lifetime of a randomly chosen battery of
a certain type. Such quantities are called continuous random variables because their
values actually range over an interval of real numbers, although they might be meas-
ured or recorded only to the nearest integer. We might want to know the probability
that a blood cholesterol level is greater than 250, or the probability that the height of
an adult female is between 60 and 70 inches, or the probability that the battery we are
buying lasts between 100 and 200 hours. If X represents the lifetime of that type of
battery, we denote this last probability as follows:
According to the frequency interpretation of probability, this number is the long-run
proportion of all batteries of the speciﬁed type whose lifetimes are between 100 and
200 hours. Since it represents a proportion, the probability naturally falls between 0
and 1.
Every continuous random variable X has a probability density function . This
means that the probability that X lies between a and b is found by integrating 
from
a to b:
For example, Figure 1 shows the graph of a model of the probability density function
for a random variable X deﬁned to be the height in inches of an adult female in the
United States (according to data from the National Health Survey). The probability
that the height of a woman chosen at random from this population is between 60 and
70 inches is equal to the area under the graph of 
from 60 to 70.
In general, the probability density function 
of a random variable X satisﬁes the
condition 
for all x. Because probabilities are measured on a scale from 0

EXAMPLE 2 Phenomena such as waiting times and equipment failure times are com-
monly modeled by exponentially decreasing probability density functions. Find the
exact form of such a function.
SOLUTION Think of the random variable as being the time you wait on hold before an
agent of a company you’re telephoning answers your call. So instead of x, let’s use t
to represent time, in minutes. If 
is the probability density function and you call at
time 
, then, from Deﬁnition 1,
represents the probability that an agent
answers within the ﬁrst two minutes and 
is the probability that your call is
answered during the ﬁfth minute.
It’s clear that 
for 
(the agent can’t answer before you place the
call). For 
we are told to use an exponentially decreasing function, that is, a
function of the form 
, where A and c are positive constants. Thus

Therefore,
and so 
. Thus, every exponential density function has the
form
A typical graph is shown in Figure 2.
Average Values
Suppose you’re waiting for a company to answer your phone call and you wonder how
long, on the average, you could expect to wait. Let 
be the corresponding density
function, where t is measured in minutes, and think of a sample of N people who have
called this company. Most likely, none of them had to wait more than an hour, so let’s
restrict our attention to the interval 
. Let’s divide that interval into n inter-
vals of length 
and endpoints 
. . . . (Think of 
as lasting a minute, or half
a minute, or 10 seconds, or even a second.) The probability that somebody’s call gets
answered during the time period from 
to 
is the area under the curve 
from 
to , which is approximately equal to 
. (This is the area of the approx-
imating rectangle in Figure 3, where is the midpoint of the interval.)
Since the long-run proportion of calls that get answered in the time period from 
to is 
, we expect that, out of our sample of N callers, the number whose call
was answered in that time period is approximately 
and the time that each
waited is about . Therefore, the total time they waited is the product of these num-
bers: approximately 
. Adding over all such intervals, we get the approxi-
mate total of everybody’s waiting times:
If we now divide by the number of callers N, we get the approximate average waiting
time:
We recognize this as a Riemann sum for the function 
. As the time interval shrinks
(that is,
and 
), this Riemann sum approaches the integral
This integral is called the mean waiting time.
In general, the mean of any probability density function 
is deﬁned to be
The mean can be interpreted as the long-run average value of the random variable X.
It can also be interpreted as a measure of centrality of the probability density function.

Thus, the probability that a call is answered during the ﬁrst minute is
So about 18% of customers’ calls are answered during the ﬁrst minute.
(b) The probability that a customer waits more than ﬁve minutes is
About 37% of customers wait more than ﬁve minutes before their calls are
answered.
Notice the result of Example 4(b): Even though the mean waiting time is 5 min-
utes, only 37% of callers wait more than 5 minutes. The reason is that some callers
have to wait much longer (maybe 10 or 15 minutes), and this brings up the average.
Another measure of centrality of a probability density function is the median. That
is a number m such that half the callers have a waiting time less than m and the other
callers have a waiting time longer than m. In general, the median of a probability den-
sity function is the number m such that
This means that half the area under the graph of
lies to the right of m. In Exercise 5
you are asked to show that the median waiting time for the company described in
Example 4 is approximately 3.5 minutes.
Normal Distributions
Many important random phenomena—such as test scores on aptitude tests, heights
and weights of individuals from a homogeneous population, annual rainfall in a given
location—are modeled by a normal distribution. That means that the probability
density function of the random variable X is a member of the family of functions
You can verify that the mean for this function is . The positive constant 
is called
the standard deviation; it measures how spread out the values of X are. From the bell-
shaped graphs of members of the family in Figure 5, we see that for small values of

the values of X are clustered about the mean, whereas for larger values of 
the 
values of X are more spread out. Statisticians have methods for using sets of data to

The factor

EXAMPLE 5 Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores are distributed normally with mean 
100 and standard deviation 15. (Figure 6 shows the corresponding probability den-
sity function.)
(a) What percentage of the population has an IQ score between 85 and 115?
(b) What percentage of the population has an IQ above 140?
SOLUTION
(a) Since IQ scores are normally distributed, we use the probability density function
given by Equation 3 with 
and 
:
Recall from Section 5.8 that the function 
doesn’t have an elementary anti-
derivative, so we can’t evaluate the integral exactly. But we can use the numerical
integration capability of a calculator or computer (or the Midpoint Rule or Simp-
son’s Rule) to estimate the integral. Doing so, we ﬁnd that
So about 68% of the population has an IQ between 85 and 115, that is, within one
standard deviation of the mean.
(b) The probability that the IQ score of a person chosen at random is more than 
140 is
To avoid the improper integral we could approximate it by the integral from 140 to
200. (It’s quite safe to say that people with an IQ over 200 are extremely rare.) Then
Therefore, about 0.4% of the population has an IQ over 140.

it occupies a state known as an orbital, which may be
thought of as a “cloud” of negative charge surrounding the

a sphere centered at the nucleus. This sphere is described in

In describing the process of modeling in Section 1.2, we talked about formulating a
mathematical model of a real-world problem either through intuitive reasoning about
the phenomenon or from a physical law based on evidence from experiments. The
mathematical model often takes the form of a differential equation, that is, an equa-
tion that contains an unknown function and some of its derivatives. This is not sur-
prising because in a real-world problem we often notice that changes occur and we
want to predict future behavior on the basis of how current values change. Let’s begin
by examining several examples of how differential equations arise when we model
physical phenomena.
Models of Population Growth
One model for the growth of a population is based on the assumption that the popu-
lation grows at a rate proportional to the size of the population. That is a reasonable
assumption for a population of bacteria or animals under ideal conditions (unlimited
environment, adequate nutrition, absence of predators, immunity from disease).
Let’s identify and name the variables in this model:
The rate of growth of the population is the derivative 
. So our assumption that
the rate of growth of the population is proportional to the population size is written as
the equation
where k is the proportionality constant. Equation 1 is our ﬁrst model for population
growth; it is a differential equation because it contains an unknown function P and its
derivative 
.
Having formulated a model, let’s look at its consequences. If we rule out a popu-
lation of 0, then 
for all t. So, if 
, then Equation 1 shows that 
for all t. This means that the population is always increasing. In fact, as 
increases,
Equation 1 shows that 
becomes larger. In other words, the growth rate increases
as the population increases.

Perhaps the most important of all the applications of
calculus is to differential equations. When physical sci-
entists or social scientists use calculus, more often than
not it is to analyze a differential equation that has
arisen in the process of modeling some phenomenon 
that they are studying. Although it is often impossible
to ﬁnd an explicit formula for the solution of a differen-
tial equation, we will see that graphical and numerical
approaches provide the needed information.
L Now is a good time to read (or
reread) the discussion of mathematical
modeling on page 24.

Let’s try to think of a solution of Equation 1. This equation asks us to ﬁnd a func-
tion whose derivative is a constant multiple of itself. We know that exponential func-
tions have that property. In fact, if we let 
, then
Thus, any exponential function of the form 
is a solution of Equation 1.
When we study this equation in detail in Section 7.4, we will see that there is no other
solution.
Allowing C to vary through all the real numbers, we get the family of solutions
whose graphs are shown in Figure 1. But populations have only positive 
values and so we are interested only in the solutions with 
. And we are proba-
bly concerned only with values of t greater than the initial time 
. Figure 2 shows
the physically meaningful solutions. Putting 
, we get 
, so the
constant C turns out to be the initial population,
.
Equation 1 is appropriate for modeling population growth under ideal conditions,
but we have to recognize that a more realistic model must reﬂect the fact that a given
environment has limited resources. Many populations start by increasing in an expo-
nential manner, but the population levels off when it approaches its carrying capacity
K (or decreases toward K if it ever exceeds K). For a model to take into account both
trends, we make two assumptions:
I
if P is small (Initially, the growth rate is proportional to P.)
I
if 
(P decreases if it ever exceeds K.)
A simple expression that incorporates both assumptions is given by the equation 
Notice that if P is small compared with K, then 
is close to 0 and so 
If 
, then 
is negative and so 
.
Equation 2 is called the logistic differential equation and was proposed by the
Dutch mathematical biologist Verhulst in the 1840s as a model for world population
growth. We will develop techniques that enable us to ﬁnd explicit solutions of the
logistic equation in Section 7.5, but for now we can deduce qualitative characteristics
of the solutions directly from Equation 2. We ﬁrst observe that the constant functions
and 
are solutions because, in either case, one of the factors on the
right side of Equation 2 is zero. (This certainly makes physical sense: If the popula-
tion is ever either 0 or at the carrying capacity, it stays that way.) These two constant
solutions are called equilibrium solutions.
If the initial population 
lies between 0 and K, then the right side of Equation 2
is positive, so 
and the population increases. But if the population exceeds
the carrying capacity 
, then 
is negative, so 
and the pop-
ulation decreases. Notice that, in either case, if the population approaches the carry-
ing capacity 
, then 
, which means the population levels off. So we
expect that the solutions of the logistic differential equation have graphs that look
something like the ones in Figure 3. Notice that the graphs move away from the equi-
librium solution 
and move toward the equilibrium solution 
.

A Model for the Motion of a Spring
Let’s now look at an example of a model from the physical sciences. We consider the
motion of an object with mass m at the end of a vertical spring (as in Figure 4). In Sec-
tion 6.5 we discussed Hooke’s Law, which says that if the spring is stretched (or com-
pressed) x units from its natural length, then it exerts a force that is proportional to x:
where k is a positive constant (called the spring constant). If we ignore any external
resisting forces (due to air resistance or friction) then, by Newton’s Second Law (force
equals mass times acceleration), we have
This is an example of what is called a second-order differential equation because it
involves second derivatives. Let’s see what we can guess about the form of the solu-
tion directly from the equation. We can rewrite Equation 3 in the form
which says that the second derivative of x is proportional to x but has the opposite sign.
We know two functions with this property, the sine and cosine functions. In fact, it
turns out that all solutions of Equation 3 can be written as combinations of certain sine 
and cosine functions (see Exercise 3). This is not surprising; we expect the spring to
oscillate about its equilibrium position and so it is natural to think that trigonometric
functions are involved.
General Differential Equations
In general, a differential equation is an equation that contains an unknown function
and one or more of its derivatives. The order of a differential equation is the order of
the highest derivative that occurs in the equation. Thus, Equations 1 and 2 are ﬁrst-
order equations and Equation 3 is a second-order equation. In all three of those equa-
tions the independent variable is called t and represents time, but in general the inde-
pendent variable doesn’t have to represent time. For example, when we consider the
differential equation
it is understood that y is an unknown function of x.
A function 
is called a solution of a differential equation if the equation is satis-
ﬁed when 
and its derivatives are substituted into the equation. Thus,
is a
solution of Equation 4 if
for all values of x in some interval.
When we are asked to solve a differential equation we are expected to ﬁnd all pos-
sible solutions of the equation. We have already solved some particularly simple dif-

ferential equations, namely, those of the form
For instance, we know that the general solution of the differential equation
is given by
where C is an arbitrary constant.
But, in general, solving a differential equation is not an easy matter. There is no
systematic technique that enables us to solve all differential equations. In Section 7.2,
however, we will see how to draw rough graphs of solutions even when we have no
explicit formula. We will also learn how to ﬁnd numerical approximations to solutions.
EXAMPLE 1 Show that every member of the family of functions
is a solution of the differential equation 
.
SOLUTION We use the Quotient Rule to differentiate the expression for y:
The right side of the differential equation becomes
Therefore, for every value of c, the given function is a solution of the differential 
equation.
When applying differential equations we are usually not as interested in ﬁnding a
family of solutions (the general solution) as we are in ﬁnding a solution that satisﬁes
some additional requirement. In many physical problems we need to ﬁnd the particu-
lar solution that satisﬁes a condition of the form 
. This is called an initial
condition, and the problem of ﬁnding a solution of the differential equation that sat-
isﬁes the initial condition is called an initial-value problem.
Geometrically, when we impose an initial condition, we look at the family of solu-
tion curves and pick the one that passes through the point 
. Physically, this cor-
responds to measuring the state of a system at time 
and using the solution of the 
initial-value problem to predict the future behavior of the system.

Unfortunately, it’s impossible to solve most differential equations in the sense of
obtaining an explicit formula for the solution. In this section we show that, despite the
absence of an explicit solution, we can still learn a lot about the solution through a
graphical approach (direction ﬁelds) or a numerical approach (Euler’s method).

Let’s think about what the differential equation means. The equation 
tells
us that the slope at any point 
on the graph (called the solution curve) is equal to
the sum of the x- and y-coordinates of the point (see Figure 1). In particular, because
the curve passes through the point 
, its slope there must be 
. So a small
portion of the solution curve near the point 
looks like a short line segment
through 
with slope 1. (See Figure 2.)
As a guide to sketching the rest of the curve, let’s draw short line segments at a
number of points 
with slope 
. The result is called a direction ﬁeld and 
is shown in Figure 3. For instance, the line segment at the point 
has slope
. The direction ﬁeld allows us to visualize the general shape of the solution
curves by indicating the direction in which the curves proceed at each point.
Now we can sketch the solution curve through the point 
by following the
direction ﬁeld as in Figure 4. Notice that we have drawn the curve so that it is paral-
lel to nearby line segments.
In general, suppose we have a ﬁrst-order differential equation of the form
where 
is some expression in 
and . The differential equation says that the
slope of a solution curve at a point 
on the curve is 
. If we draw short line
segments with slope 
at several points 
, the result is called a direction ﬁeld
(or slope ﬁeld). These line segments indicate the direction in which a solution curve
is heading, so the direction ﬁeld helps us visualize the general shape of these curves.

EXAMPLE 1
(a) Sketch the direction ﬁeld for the differential equation 
.
(b) Use part (a) to sketch the solution curve that passes through the origin.
SOLUTION
(a) We start by computing the slope at several points in the following chart:
Now we draw short line segments with these slopes at these points. The result is the
direction ﬁeld shown in Figure 5.
(b) We start at the origin and move to the right in the direction of the line segment
(which has slope 
). We continue to draw the solution curve so that it moves par-
allel to the nearby line segments. The resulting solution curve is shown in Figure 6.
Returning to the origin, we draw the solution curve to the left as well.
The more line segments we draw in a direction ﬁeld, the clearer the picture
becomes. Of course, it’s tedious to compute slopes and draw line segments for a huge
number of points by hand, but computers are well suited for this task. Figure 7 shows
a more detailed, computer-drawn direction ﬁeld for the differential equation in
Example 1. It enables us to draw, with reasonable accuracy, the solution curves shown
in Figure 8 with -intercepts

Module 7.2A shows direction
ﬁelds and solution curves for a
variety of differential equations.

Now let’s see how direction ﬁelds give insight into physical situations. The simple
electric circuit shown in Figure 9 contains an electromotive force (usually a battery or
generator) that produces a voltage of 
volts (V) and a current of 
amperes (A)
at time t. The circuit also contains a resistor with a resistance of R ohms (
) and an
inductor with an inductance of L henries (H).
Ohm’s Law gives the drop in voltage due to the resistor as RI. The voltage drop due
to the inductor is 
. One of Kirchhoff’s laws says that the sum of the voltage
drops is equal to the supplied voltage 
. Thus, we have
which is a ﬁrst-order differential equation that models the current at time .
EXAMPLE 2 Suppose that in the simple circuit of Figure 9 the resistance is 
, the
inductance is 4 H, and a battery gives a constant voltage of 60 V.
(a) Draw a direction ﬁeld for Equation 1 with these values.
(b) What can you say about the limiting value of the current?
(c) Identify any equilibrium solutions.
(d) If the switch is closed when 
so the current starts with 
, use the
direction ﬁeld to sketch the solution curve.
SOLUTION
(a) If we put 
,
, and 
in Equation 1, we get
The direction ﬁeld for this differential equation is shown in Figure 10.
(b) It appears from the direction ﬁeld that all solutions approach the value 5 A, that is,
(c) It appears that the constant function 
is an equilibrium solution. Indeed,
we can verify this directly from the differential equation. If 
, then the left
side is 
and the right side is 
.

(d) We use the direction ﬁeld to sketch the solution curve that passes through 
,
as shown in red in Figure 11.
Notice from Figure 10 that the line segments along any horizontal line are parallel.
That is because the independent variable t does not occur on the right side of the equa-
tion 
. In general, a differential equation of the form
in which the independent variable is missing from the right side, is called autono-
mous. For such an equation, the slopes corresponding to two different points with the
same y-coordinate must be equal. This means that if we know one solution to an auton-
omous differential equation, then we can obtain inﬁnitely many others just by shifting
the graph of the known solution to the right or left. In Figure 11 we have shown the
solutions that result from shifting the solution curve of Example 2 one and two units
to the right. They correspond to closing the switch when 
or 
. Notice that
the system behaves the same at any time.
Euler’s Method
The basic idea behind direction ﬁelds can be used to ﬁnd numerical approximations
to solutions of differential equations. We illustrate the method on the initial-value
problem that we used to introduce direction ﬁelds:
The differential equation tells us that 
, so the solution curve has
slope 1 at the point 
. As a ﬁrst approximation to the solution we could use the
linear approximation 
. In other words, we could use the tangent line at
as a rough approximation to the solution curve (see Figure 12).
Euler’s idea was to improve on this approximation by proceeding only a short dis-
tance along this tangent line and then making a midcourse correction by changing
direction as indicated by the direction ﬁeld. Figure 13 shows what happens if we start
out along the tangent line but stop when 
. (This horizontal distance traveled is
called the step size.) Since 
, we have 
and we take 
as the starting point for a new line segment. The differential equation tells us that
, so we use the linear function

as an approximation to the solution for 
(the gold-colored segment in Fig-
ure 13). If we decrease the step size from 
to 
, we get the better Euler approx-
imation shown in Figure 14.
In general, Euler’s method says to start at the point given by the initial value and
proceed in the direction indicated by the direction ﬁeld. Stop after a short time, look
at the slope at the new location, and proceed in that direction. Keep stopping and
changing direction according to the direction ﬁeld. Euler’s method does not produce
the exact solution to an initial-value problem—it gives approximations. But by
decreasing the step size (and therefore increasing the number of midcourse correc-
tions), we obtain successively better approximations to the exact solution. (Compare
Figures 12, 13, and 14.)

Proceeding with similar calculations, we get the values in the following table.
For a more accurate table of values in Example 3 we could decrease the step size.
But for a large number of small steps the amount of computation is considerable and
so we need to program a calculator or computer to carry out these calculations. The
following table shows the results of applying Euler’s method with decreasing step size
to the initial-value problem of Example 3.
Notice that the Euler estimates in the table seem to be approaching limits, namely,

with step sizes 0.5, 0.25, 0.1, 0.05, 0.02, 0.01, and 0.005. They are approaching the
exact solution curve as the step size h approaches 0.

We have looked at ﬁrst-order differential equations from a geometric point of view
(direction ﬁelds) and from a numerical point of view (Euler’s method). What about the
symbolic point of view? It would be nice to have an explicit formula for a solution of
a differential equation. Unfortunately, that is not always possible. But in this section
we examine a certain type of differential equation that can be solved explicitly.
A separable equation is a ﬁrst-order differential equation in which the expression
for 
can be factored as a function of x times a function of y. In other words, it
can be written in the form
The name separable comes from the fact that the expression on the right side can 
be “separated” into a function of and a function of . Equivalently, if 
, we
could write
where 
. To solve this equation we rewrite it in the differential form
so that all ’s are on one side of the equation and all ’s are on the other side. Then we
integrate both sides of the equation:
Equation 2 deﬁnes 
implicitly as a function of . In some cases we may be able to
solve for in terms of .
The justiﬁcation for the step in Equation 2 comes from the Substitution Rule:
(from Equation 1)

CHAPTER 7 DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
L The technique for solving separable
differential equations was ﬁrst used by
James Bernoulli (in 1690) in solving a
problem about pendulums and by 
Leibniz (in a letter to Huygens in 1691).
John Bernoulli explained the general
method in a paper published in 1694.

SOLUTION
(a) Writing the equation in differential form and integrating both sides, we have
where 
is an arbitrary constant. (We could have used a constant 
on the left side
and another constant 
on the right side. But then we could combine these con-
stants by writing 
.)
Equation 3 gives the general solution implicitly. In this case it’s impossible to
solve the equation to express explicitly as a function of .
(b) We are given the initial condition 
, so we substitute 
and 
in Equation 3:
Therefore, the solution is given implicitly by
The graph of this solution is shown in Figure 2. (Compare with Figure 1.)
EXAMPLE 2 Solve the equation 
.
SOLUTION First we rewrite the equation using Leibniz notation:
If 
, we can rewrite it in differential notation and integrate:
This equation deﬁnes implicitly as a function of . But in this case we can solve
explicitly for as follows:
so
We note that the function 
is also a solution of the given differential equation.

Orthogonal Trajectories
An orthogonal trajectory of a family of curves is a curve that intersects each curve
of the family orthogonally, that is, at right angles (see Figure 7). For instance, each
member of the family 
of straight lines through the origin is an orthogonal tra-
jectory of the family 
of concentric circles with center the origin (see
Figure 8). We say that the two families are orthogonal trajectories of each other.
EXAMPLE 4 Find the orthogonal trajectories of the family of curves 
, where 
is an arbitrary constant.
SOLUTION The curves 
form a family of parabolas whose axis of symmetry is
the -axis. The ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd a single differential equation that is satisﬁed by all
members of the family. If we differentiate 
, we get
This differential equation depends on , but we need an equation that is valid for all
values of simultaneously. To eliminate we note that, from the equation of the
given general parabola 
, we have 
and so the differential equation

This means that the slope of the tangent line at any point 
on one of the parabo-

. On an orthogonal trajectory the slope of the tangent line must be
the negative reciprocal of this slope. Therefore, the orthogonal trajectories must
satisfy the differential equation
This differential equation is separable, and we solve it as follows:

is an arbitrary positive constant. Thus, the orthogonal trajectories are the
family of ellipses given by Equation 4 and sketched in Figure 9.
Orthogonal trajectories occur in various branches of physics. For example, in an
electrostatic ﬁeld the lines of force are orthogonal to the lines of constant potential.
Also, the streamlines in aerodynamics are orthogonal trajectories of the velocity-
equipotential curves.
Mixing Problems
A typical mixing problem involves a tank of ﬁxed capacity ﬁlled with a thoroughly
mixed solution of some substance, such as salt. A solution of a given concentration
enters the tank at a ﬁxed rate and the mixture, thoroughly stirred, leaves at a ﬁxed rate,
which may differ from the entering rate. If 
denotes the amount of substance in the
tank at time t, then 
is the rate at which the substance is being added minus the
rate at which it is being removed. The mathematical description of this situation often
leads to a ﬁrst-order separable differential equation. We can use the same type of rea-
soning to model a variety of phenomena: chemical reactions, discharge of pollutants
into a lake, injection of a drug into the bloodstream.
EXAMPLE 5 A tank contains 20 kg of salt dissolved in 5000 L of water. Brine that
contains 0.03 kg of salt per liter of water enters the tank at a rate of 25 Lmin. The
solution is kept thoroughly mixed and drains from the tank at the same rate. How
much salt remains in the tank after half an hour?
SOLUTION Let 
be the amount of salt (in kilograms) after minutes. We are given
that 
and we want to ﬁnd 
. We do this by ﬁnding a differential equa-
tion satisﬁed by

The tank always contains 5000 L of liquid, so the concentration at time is

Which Is Faster, Going Up or Coming Down?
Suppose you throw a ball into the air. Do you think it takes longer to reach its maximum 
height or to fall back to Earth from its maximum height? We will solve the problem in this
project but, before getting started, think about that situation and make a guess based on your
physical intuition.
1. A ball with mass 
is projected vertically upward from Earth’s surface with a positive
initial velocity . We assume the forces acting on the ball are the force of gravity and a
retarding force of air resistance with direction opposite to the direction of motion and
with magnitude 
, where 
is a positive constant and 
is the velocity of the 
ball at time . In both the ascent and the descent, the total force acting on the ball is
. (During ascent,
is positive and the resistance acts downward; during
descent,
is negative and the resistance acts upward.) So, by Newton’s Second Law,
the equation of motion is

One of the models for population growth that we considered in Section 7.1 was based 
on the assumption that the population grows at a rate proportional to the size of the 
population:
Is that a reasonable assumption? Suppose that we have a population (of bacteria, for
instance) with size 
and at a certain time it is growing at a rate of 
bacteria per hour. Now let’s take another 1000 bacteria of the same type and put them
with the ﬁrst population. Each half of the new population was growing at a rate of 300
bacteria per hour. We would expect the total population of 2000 to increase at a rate
of 600 bacteria per hour initially (provided there’s enough room and nutrition). So if
we double the size, we double the growth rate. In general, it seems reasonable that the
growth rate should be proportional to the size.
The same assumption applies in other situations as well. In nuclear physics, the
mass of a radioactive substance decays at a rate proportional to the mass. In chemistry,
the rate of a unimolecular ﬁrst-order reaction is proportional to the concentration of
the substance. In ﬁnance, the value of a savings account with continuously com-
pounded interest increases at a rate proportional to that value.
In general, if 
is the value of a quantity 
at time and if the rate of change of
with respect to is proportional to its size 
at any time, then

lem 3, estimate

5. In general, it’s not easy to ﬁnd 
because it’s impossible to solve the equation 
explicitly. We can, however, use an indirect method to determine whether ascent or
descent is faster; we determine whether 
is positive or negative. Show that

) or the law of natural decay (if 
). Because it is a separable differential
equation we can solve it by the methods of Section 7.3:
where A (
or 0) is an arbitrary constant. To see the signiﬁcance of the constant
A, we observe that
Therefore, A is the initial value of the function.
Because Equation 1 occurs so frequently in nature, we summarize what we have
just proved for future use.
The solution of the initial-value problem

Population Growth
What is the signiﬁcance of the proportionality constant k? In the context of population
growth, we can write
The quantity
is the growth rate divided by the population size; it is called the relative growth rate.
According to (3), instead of saying “the growth rate is proportional to population size”
we could say “the relative growth rate is constant.” Then (2) says that a population
with constant relative growth rate must grow exponentially. Notice that the relative
growth rate k appears as the coefﬁcient of t in the exponential function 
. For in-

tion grows at a rate of 2% per year. If the population at time 0 is 
, then the expres-
sion for the population is
EXAMPLE 1 Assuming that the growth rate is proportional to population size, use the
data in Table 1 to model the population of the world in the 20th century. What is the
relative growth rate? How well does the model ﬁt the data?
SOLUTION We measure the time t in years and let 
in the year 1900. We measure
the population 
in millions of people. Then the initial condition is 
We are assuming that the growth rate is proportional to population size, so the 
initial-value problem is
From (2) we know that the solution is
One way to estimate the relative growth rate k is to use the fact that the population
in 1910 was 1750 million. Therefore
We solve this equation for k:
Thus, the relative growth rate is about 0.6% per year and the model becomes
Table 2 and Figure 1 allow us to compare the predictions of this model with the
actual data. You can see that the predictions become quite inaccurate after about
30 years and they underestimate by a factor of more than 2 in 2000.

Another possibility for estimating k would be to use the given population for
1950, for instance, instead of 1910. Then
The estimate for the relative growth rate is now 0.88% per year and the model is
The predictions with this second model are shown in Table 3 and Figure 2. This
exponential model is more accurate over a longer period of time, but it too lags
behind reality in recent years.
EXAMPLE 2 Use the data in Table 1 to model the population of the world in the sec-
ond half of the 20th century. Use the model to estimate the population in 1993 and
to predict the population in the year 2010.
SOLUTION Here we let 
in the year 1950. Then the initial-value problem is
and the solution is
Let’s estimate k by using the population in 1960:

L In Section 1.5 we modeled the same
data with an exponential function, but
there we used the method of least
squares.

We estimate that the world population in 1993 was
The model predicts that the population in 2010 will be
The graph in Figure 3 shows that the model is fairly accurate to date, so the estimate
for 1993 is quite reliable. But the prediction for 2010 is riskier.
Radioactive Decay
Radioactive substances decay by spontaneously emitting radiation. If 
is the mass
remaining from an initial mass 
of the substance after time t, then the relative decay
rate
has been found experimentally to be constant. (Since 
is negative, the relative
decay rate is positive.) It follows that
where k is a negative constant. In other words, radioactive substances decay at a rate
proportional to the remaining mass. This means that we can use (2) to show that the
mass decays exponentially:
Physicists express the rate of decay in terms of half-life, the time required for half
of any given quantity to decay.
EXAMPLE 3 The half-life of radium-226 (
) is 1590 years.

Continuously Compounded Interest
EXAMPLE 4 If $1000 is invested at 6% interest, compounded annually, then after
1 year the investment is worth 
, after 2 years it’s worth
, and after years it’s worth 
. In general,
if an amount 
is invested at an interest rate (in this example,
), then
after years it’s worth 
. Usually, however, interest is compounded more
frequently, say,
times a year. Then in each compounding period the interest rate is

and there are 
compounding periods in years, so the value of the investment
is
For instance, after 3 years at 6% interest a $1000 investment will be worth
You can see that the interest paid increases as the number of compounding periods
increases. If we let 
, then we will be compounding the interest continu-
ously and the value of the investment will be
(where 
)
But the limit in this expression is equal to the number e (see Equation 3.7.6). So
with continuous compounding of interest at interest rate r, the amount after t years is
If we differentiate this equation, we get
which says that, with continuous compounding of interest, the rate of increase of an
investment is proportional to its size.
Returning to the example of $1000 invested for 3 years at 6% interest, we see
that with continuous compounding of interest the value of the investment will be
Notice how close this is to the amount we calculated for daily compounding,
$1197.20. But the amount is easier to compute if we use continuous compounding.

11. Scientists can determine the age of ancient objects by a
method called radiocarbon dating. The bombardment of the
upper atmosphere by cosmic rays converts nitrogen to a
radioactive isotope of carbon,
C, with a half-life of about
5730 years. Vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide through the
atmosphere and animal life assimilates C through food
chains. When a plant or animal dies it stops replacing its
carbon and the amount of C begins to decrease through
radioactive decay. Therefore, the level of radioactivity 
must also decay exponentially. A parchment fragment was
discovered that had about 74% as much C radioactivity as
does plant material on Earth today. Estimate the age of the
parchment.

Calculus and Baseball
In this project we explore three of the many applications of calculus to baseball. The physi-
cal interactions of the game, especially the collision of ball and bat, are quite complex and
their models are discussed in detail in a book by Robert Adair, The Physics of Baseball
(New York: Harper and Row, 1990).
1. It may surprise you to learn that the collision of baseball and bat lasts only about a
thousandth of a second. Here we calculate the average force on the bat during this colli-
sion by ﬁrst computing the change in the ball’s momentum.
The 
of an object is the product of its mass 
and its velocity , that 
is,
. Suppose an object, moving along a straight line, is acted on by a force
that is a continuous function of time.
(a) Show that the change in momentum over a time interval 
is equal to the inte-
gral of 
from 
to ; that is, show that
This integral is called the impulse of the force over the time interval.
(b) A pitcher throws a 90-mih fastball to a batter, who hits a line drive directly back 
to the pitcher. The ball is in contact with the bat for 0.001 s and leaves the bat with
velocity 110 mih. A baseball weighs 5 oz and, in U. S. Customary units, its mass is
measured in slugs:
where 
.
(i) Find the change in the ball’s momentum.
(ii) Find the average force on the bat.
2. In this problem we calculate the work required for a pitcher to throw a 90-mih fastball
by ﬁrst considering kinetic energy.
The kinetic energy
of an object of mass 
and velocity is given by 
.
Suppose an object of mass , moving in a straight line, is acted on by a force 
that depends on its position . According to Newton’s Second Law
where 
and denote the acceleration and velocity of the object. 
(a) Show that the work done in moving the object from a position 
to a position 
is
equal to the change in the object’s kinetic energy; that is, show that
where 
and 
are the velocities of the object at the positions 
and . Hint: By the Chain Rule,

In this section we discuss in detail a model for population growth, the logistic model,
that is more sophisticated than exponential growth. In doing so we use all the tools at
our disposal—direction ﬁelds and Euler’s method from Section 7.2 and the explicit
solution of separable differential equations from Section 7.3. In the exercises we
investigate other possible models for population growth, some of which take into
account harvesting and seasonal growth.
The Logistic Model
As we discussed in Section 7.1, a population often increases exponentially in its early
stages but levels off eventually and approaches its carrying capacity because of lim-
ited resources. If 
is the size of the population at time t, we assume that
This says that the growth rate is initially close to being proportional to size. In other
words, the relative growth rate is almost constant when the population is small. But
we also want to reﬂect the fact that the relative growth rate decreases as the popula-
tion P increases and becomes negative if P ever exceeds its carrying capacity K, the
maximum population that the environment is capable of sustaining in the long run.
The simplest expression for the relative growth rate that incorporates these assump-
tions is
Multiplying by P, we obtain the model for population growth known as the logistic
differential equation:
Notice from Equation 1 that if P is small compared with K, then 
is close to 0 and
so 
. However, if

(b) The manager of the team wonders whether the ball will reach home plate sooner if
it is relayed by an inﬁelder. The shortstop can position himself directly between the
outﬁelder and home plate, catch the ball thrown by the outﬁelder, turn, and throw
the ball to the catcher with an initial velocity of 105 fts. The manager clocks the
relay time of the shortstop (catching, turning, throwing) at half a second. How far
from home plate should the shortstop position himself to minimize the total time 
for the ball to reach the plate? Should the manager encourage a direct throw or a
relayed throw? What if the shortstop can throw at 115 fts?
;
(c) For what throwing velocity of the shortstop does a relayed throw take the same time
as a direct throw?

CHAPTER 7 DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
then 
, so 
. We can deduce information about whether solutions
increase or decrease directly from Equation 1. If the population P lies between 0 and
K, then the right side of the equation is positive, so 
and the population
increases. But if the population exceeds the carrying capacity 
, then 
is negative, so 
and the population decreases.
Direction Fields
Let’s start our more detailed analysis of the logistic differential equation by looking at
a direction ﬁeld.
EXAMPLE 1 Draw a direction ﬁeld for the logistic equation with 
and carry-
ing capacity 
. What can you deduce about the solutions?
SOLUTION In this case the logistic differential equation is
A direction ﬁeld for this equation is shown in Figure 1. We show only the ﬁrst quad-
rant because negative populations aren’t meaningful and we are interested only in
what happens after 
.
The logistic equation is autonomous (
depends only on P, not on t), so the
slopes are the same along any horizontal line. As expected, the slopes are positive
for 
and negative for 
.
The slopes are small when P is close to 0 or 1000 (the carrying capacity). Notice
that the solutions move away from the equilibrium solution 
and move toward
the equilibrium solution 
.
In Figure 2 we use the direction ﬁeld to sketch solution curves with initial popu-
lations 
,
, and 
. Notice that solution curves 
that start below 
are increasing and those that start above 
are
decreasing. The slopes are greatest when 
and, therefore, the solution
curves that start below 
have inﬂection points when 
. In fact we
can prove that all solution curves that start below 
have an inﬂection point
when P is exactly 500 (see Exercise 9).

Euler’s Method
Next let’s use Euler’s method to obtain numerical estimates for solutions of the logis-
tic differential equation at speciﬁc times.
EXAMPLE 2 Use Euler’s method with step sizes 20, 10, 5, 1, and 0.1 to estimate the
population sizes 
and 
, where P is the solution of the initial-value 
problem
SOLUTION With step size 
,
,
, and
we get, using the notation of Section 7.2,
Thus, our estimates for the population sizes at times 
and 
are
For smaller step sizes we need to program a calculator or computer. The table gives 
the results.
Figure 3 shows a graph of the Euler approximations with step sizes 
and
. We see that the Euler approximation with 
looks very much like the
lower solution curve that we drew using a direction ﬁeld in Figure 2.

The Analytic Solution
The logistic equation (1) is separable and so we can solve it explicitly using the method
of Section 7.3. Since
we have
To evaluate the integral on the left side, we write
Using partial fractions (see Section 5.7), we get
This enables us to rewrite Equation 2:
where

which is to be expected.

. At what time does the popu-
lation reach 900?
SOLUTION The differential equation is a logistic equation with 
, carrying
capacity 
, and initial population 
. So Equation 4 gives the popu-
lation at time t as
Thus
So the population sizes when 
and 80 are
The population reaches 900 when
Solving this equation for t, we get
So the population reaches 900 when t is approximately 55. As a check on our work,

Comparison of the Natural Growth and Logistic Models
In the 1930s the biologist G. F. Gause conducted an experiment with the protozoan
Paramecium and used a logistic equation to model his data. The table gives his daily
count of the population of protozoa. He estimated the initial relative growth rate to be
0.7944 and the carrying capacity to be 64.
EXAMPLE 4 Find the exponential and logistic models for Gause’s data. Compare the
predicted values with the observed values and comment on the ﬁt.
SOLUTION Given the relative growth rate 
and the initial population 
,
the exponential model is
Gause used the same value of k for his logistic model. [This is reasonable because
is small compared with the carrying capacity (
). The equation
shows that the value of k for the logistic model is very close to the value for the
exponential model.]
Then the solution of the logistic equation in Equation 4 gives
where
So
We use these equations to calculate the predicted values (rounded to the nearest
integer) and compare them in the table.

We notice from the table and from the graph in Figure 5 that for the ﬁrst three 
or four days the exponential model gives results comparable to those of the more
sophisticated logistic model. For 
, however, the exponential model is hope-
lessly inaccurate, but the logistic model ﬁts the observations reasonably well.
Other Models for Population Growth
The Law of Natural Growth and the logistic differential equation are not the only equa-
tions that have been proposed to model population growth. In Exercise 14 we look at
the Gompertz growth function and in Exercises 15 and 16 we investigate seasonal-
growth models.
Two of the other models are modiﬁcations of the logistic model. The differential 
equation
has been used to model populations that are subject to “harvesting” of one sort or
another. (Think of a population of ﬁsh being caught at a constant rate). This equation
is explored in Exercises 11 and 12.
For some species there is a minimum population level m below which the species
tends to become extinct. (Adults may not be able to ﬁnd suitable mates.) Such popu-
lations have been modeled by the differential equation
where the extra factor,
, takes into account the consequences of a sparse pop-
ulation (see Exercise 13).

We have looked at a variety of models for the growth of a single species that lives
alone in an environment. In this section we consider more realistic models that take
into account the interaction of two species in the same habitat. We will see that these
models take the form of a pair of linked differential equations.
We ﬁrst consider the situation in which one species, called the prey, has an ample
food supply and the second species, called the predators, feeds on the prey. Examples
of prey and predators include rabbits and wolves in an isolated forest, food ﬁsh and
sharks, aphids and ladybugs, and bacteria and amoebas. Our model will have two
dependent variables and both are functions of time. We let 
be the number of prey
(using R for rabbits) and 
be the number of predators (with W for wolves) at time t.
In the absence of predators, the ample food supply would support exponential
growth of the prey, that is,
In the absence of prey, we assume that the predator population would decline at a rate
proportional to itself, that is,
With both species present, however, we assume that the principal cause of death
among the prey is being eaten by a predator, and the birth and survival rates of the
predators depend on their available food supply, namely, the prey. We also assume that
the two species encounter each other at a rate that is proportional to both populations
and is therefore proportional to the product RW. (The more there are of either popu-
lation, the more encounters there are likely to be.) A system of two differential equa-
tions that incorporates these assumptions is as follows:

where k, r, a, and b are positive constants. Notice that the term aRW decreases the
natural growth rate of the prey and the term bRW increases the natural growth rate of
the predators.
The equations in (1) are known as the predator-prey equations, or the Lotka-
Volterra equations. A solution of this system of equations is a pair of functions 
and 
that describe the populations of prey and predator as functions of time.
Because the system is coupled (R and W occur in both equations), we can’t solve one
equation and then the other; we have to solve them simultaneously. Unfortunately, it
is usually impossible to ﬁnd explicit formulas for R and W as functions of t. We can,
however, use graphical methods to analyze the equations. 
EXAMPLE 1 Suppose that populations of rabbits and wolves are described by the
Lotka-Volterra equations (1) with k  0.08, a  0.001, r  0.02, and b  0.00002.
The time is measured in months.
(a) Find the constant solutions (called the equilibrium solutions) and interpret 
the answer.
(b) Use the system of differential equations to ﬁnd an expression for 
.
(c) Draw a direction ﬁeld for the resulting differential equation in the RW-plane.
Then use that direction ﬁeld to sketch some solution curves.
(d) Suppose that, at some point in time, there are 1000 rabbits and 40 wolves. Draw
the corresponding solution curve and use it to describe the changes in both popula-
tion levels.
(e) Use part (d) to make sketches of R and W as functions of t.
SOLUTION
(a) With the given values of k, a, r, and b, the Lotka-Volterra equations become
Both R and W will be constant if both derivatives are 0, that is,
One solution is given by R  0 and W  0. (This makes sense: If there are no rab-
bits or wolves, the populations are certainly not going to increase.) The other constant
solution is
So the equilibrium populations consist of 80 wolves and 1000 rabbits. This means
that 1000 rabbits are just enough to support a constant wolf population of 80. There
are neither too many wolves (which would result in fewer rabbits) nor too few
wolves (which would result in more rabbits).

L The Lotka-Volterra equations were 
proposed as a model to explain the 
variations in the shark and food-ﬁsh 
populations in the Adriatic Sea by the
Italian mathematician Vito Volterra
(1860 –1940).

(b) We use the Chain Rule to eliminate t:
so
(c) If we think of W as a function of R, we have the differential equation
We draw the direction ﬁeld for this differential equation in Figure 1 and we use it to
sketch several solution curves in Figure 2. If we move along a solution curve, we
observe how the relationship between R and W changes as time passes. Notice that
the curves appear to be closed in the sense that if we travel along a curve, we always
return to the same point. Notice also that the point (1000, 80) is inside all the solu-
tion curves. That point is called an equilibrium point because it corresponds to the
equilibrium solution R  1000, W  80.
When we represent solutions of a system of differential equations as in Figure 2,
we refer to the RW-plane as the phase plane, and we call the solution curves phase
trajectories. So a phase trajectory is a path traced out by solutions 
as time
goes by. A phase portrait consists of equilibrium points and typical phase trajecto-
ries, as shown in Figure 2.
(d) Starting with 1000 rabbits and 40 wolves corresponds to drawing the solution
curve through the point 
. Figure 3 shows this phase trajectory with the
direction ﬁeld removed. Starting at the point 
at time t  0 and letting t increase,
do we move clockwise or counterclockwise around the phase trajectory? If we put

Since 
, we conclude that R is increasing at 
and so we move counter-
clockwise around the phase trajectory.
We see that at 
there aren’t enough wolves to maintain a balance between the
populations, so the rabbit population increases. That results in more wolves and
eventually there are so many wolves that the rabbits have a hard time avoiding them.
So the number of rabbits begins to decline (at 
, where we estimate that R reaches
its maximum population of about 2800). This means that at some later time the wolf
population starts to fall (at 
, where R  1000 and 
). But this beneﬁts 
the rabbits, so their population later starts to increase (at 
, where W  80 and
). As a consequence, the wolf population eventually starts to increase as
well. This happens when the populations return to their initial values of R  1000
and W  40, and the entire cycle begins again.
(e) From the description in part (d) of how the rabbit and wolf populations rise and
fall, we can sketch the graphs of 
and 
. Suppose the points 
,
, and 
in
Figure 3 are reached at times ,
, and . Then we can sketch graphs of R and W as
in Figure 4.
To make the graphs easier to compare, we draw the graphs on the same axes but
with different scales for R and W, as in Figure 5. Notice that the rabbits reach their
maximum populations about a quarter of a cycle before the wolves.

An important part of the modeling process, as we discussed in Section 1.2, is to
interpret our mathematical conclusions as real-world predictions and to test the pre-
dictions against real data. The Hudson’s Bay Company, which started trading in ani-
mal furs in Canada in 1670, has kept records that date back to the 1840s. Figure 6
shows graphs of the number of pelts of the snowshoe hare and its predator, the Canada
lynx, traded by the company over a 90-year period. You can see that the coupled oscil-
lations in the hare and lynx populations predicted by the Lotka-Volterra model do
actually occur and the period of these cycles is roughly 10 years.
Although the relatively simple Lotka-Volterra model has had some success in
explaining and predicting coupled populations, more sophisticated models have also
been proposed. One way to modify the Lotka-Volterra equations is to assume that, in
the absence of predators, the prey grow according to a logistic model with carrying
capacity K. Then the Lotka-Volterra equations (1) are replaced by the system of dif-
ferential equations
This model is investigated in Exercises 9 and 10.
Models have also been proposed to describe and predict population levels of two
species that compete for the same resources or cooperate for mutual beneﬁt. Such
models are explored in Exercise 2.

9. A planning engineer for a new alum plant must present some estimates to his company
regarding the capacity of a silo designed to contain bauxite ore until it is processed into

A sequence can be thought of as a list of numbers written in a deﬁnite order:
The number 
is called the ﬁrst term,
is the second term, and in general 
is the
nth term. We will deal exclusively with inﬁnite sequences and so each term 
will
have a successor 
.
Notice that for every positive integer 
there is a corresponding number 
and so
a sequence can be deﬁned as a function whose domain is the set of positive integers.
But we usually write 
instead of the function notation 
for the value of the func-
tion at the number .

EXAMPLE 1 Some sequences can be deﬁned by giving a formula for the 
term. In
the following examples we give three descriptions of the sequence: one by using the
preceding notation, another by using the deﬁning formula, and a third by writing out
the terms of the sequence. Notice that n doesn’t have to start at 1.

Inﬁnite sequences and series were introduced brieﬂy in
A Preview of Calculus in connection with Zeno’s para-
doxes and the decimal representation of numbers.
Their importance in calculus stems from Newton’s idea
of representing functions as sums of inﬁnite series. For
instance, in ﬁnding areas he often integrated a func-
tion by ﬁrst expressing it as a series and then inte-
grating each term of the series. We will pursue his
idea in Section 8.7 in order to integrate such functions
as 
. (Recall that we have previously been unable 
to do this.) And in Section 8.10 we will use series to
solve differential equations. Many of the functions that
arise in mathematical physics and chemistry, such as
Bessel functions, are deﬁned as sums of series, so it 
is important to be familiar with the basic concepts of 
convergence of inﬁnite sequences and series.
Physicists also use series in another way, as we will
see in Section 8.9. In studying ﬁelds as diverse as
optics, special relativity, and electromagnetism, they
analyze phenomena by replacing a function with the
ﬁrst few terms in the series that represents it.

EXAMPLE 2 Here are some sequences that don’t have a simple deﬁning equation.
(a) The sequence 
, where 
is the population of the world as of January 1 in
the year .
(b) If we let 
be the digit in the 
decimal place of the number , then 
is a
well-deﬁned sequence whose ﬁrst few terms are
(c) The Fibonacci sequence
is deﬁned recursively by the conditions
Each term is the sum of the two preceding terms. The ﬁrst few terms are
This sequence arose when the 13th-century Italian mathematician known as
Fibonacci solved a problem concerning the breeding of rabbits (see Exercise 37).
A sequence such as the one in Example 1(a),
, can be pictured
either by plotting its terms on a number line, as in Figure 1, or by plotting its graph,
as in Figure 2. Note that, since a sequence is a function whose domain is the set of
positive integers, its graph consists of isolated points with coordinates
. . .
. . .
From Figure 1 or 2 it appears that the terms of the sequence 
are
approaching 1 as 
becomes large. In fact, the difference
can be made as small as we like by taking 
sufﬁciently large. We indicate this by 
writing
In general, the notation
means that the terms of the sequence 
approach 
as becomes large. Notice that
the following deﬁnition of the limit of a sequence is very similar to the deﬁnition of a
limit of a function at inﬁnity given in Section 2.5.

CHAPTER 8 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES

Definition A sequence 
has the limit
and we write
if we can make the terms 
as close to 
as we like by taking 
sufﬁciently
large. If 
exists, we say the sequence converges (or is convergent).
Otherwise, we say the sequence diverges (or is divergent).
Figure 3 illustrates Deﬁnition 1 by showing the graphs of two sequences that have
the limit .
If you compare Deﬁnition 1 with Deﬁnition 2.5.4 you will see that the only differ-
ence between 
and 
is that 
is required to be an inte-
ger. Thus, we have the following theorem, which is illustrated by Figure 4.
Theorem If 
and 
when 
is an integer, then 
.
In particular, since we know from Section 2.5 that 
when 
we have
if
If 
becomes large as n becomes large, we use the notation
In this case the sequence 
is divergent, but in a special way. We say that 
di-
verges to .
The Limit Laws given in Section 2.3 also hold for the limits of sequences and their
proofs are similar.

L This shows that the guess we made
earlier from Figures 1 and 2 was correct.

SOLUTION Notice that both numerator and denominator approach inﬁnity as 
.
We can’t apply l’Hospital’s Rule directly because it applies not to sequences but to
functions of a real variable. However, we can apply l’Hospital’s Rule to the related
function 
and obtain
Therefore, by Theorem 2 we have
EXAMPLE 5 Determine whether the sequence

The graph of this sequence is shown in Figure 6. Since the terms oscillate between 1

pens to

decreasing and perhaps approach 0. To conﬁrm this, observe from Equation 5 that

L Creating Graphs of Sequences
Some computer algebra systems have
special commands that enable us to cre-
ate sequences and graph them directly.
With most graphing calculators, how-
ever, sequences can be graphed by
using parametric equations. For instance,
the sequence in Example 7 can be
graphed by entering the parametric
equations
and graphing in dot mode starting with
, setting the -step equal to . The
result is shown in Figure 8.

EXAMPLE 9 The sequence 
is decreasing because

. (The right side is smaller because it has a larger denominator.)
EXAMPLE 10 Show that the sequence 
is decreasing.
SOLUTION 1 We must show that 
, that is,
This inequality is equivalent to the one we get by cross-multiplication:
Since 
, we know that the inequality 
is true. Therefore,
and so 
is decreasing.
SOLUTION 2 Consider the function

Thus,

. Therefore,

Definition A sequence 
is bounded above if there is a number 
such that
It is bounded below if there is a number 
such that
If it is bounded above and below, then 
is a bounded sequence.
For instance, the sequence

We know that not every bounded sequence is convergent [
satisﬁes
but is divergent, from Example 5] and not every monotonic sequence is
convergent 
. But if a sequence is both bounded and monotonic, then it
must be convergent. This fact is stated without proof as Theorem 7, but intuitively you
can understand why it is true by looking at Figure 10. If 
is increasing and 
for all , then the terms are forced to crowd together and approach some number .
Monotonic Sequence Theorem Every bounded, monotonic sequence is 
convergent.
EXAMPLE 11 Investigate the sequence 
deﬁned by the recurrence relation
SOLUTION We begin by computing the ﬁrst several terms:
These initial terms suggest that the sequence is increasing and the terms are
approaching 6. To conﬁrm that the sequence is increasing, we use mathematical
induction to show that 
for all 
. This is true for 
because
. If we assume that it is true for 
, then we have
so
and
Thus
We have deduced that 
is true for 
. Therefore, the inequality is
true for all by induction.
Next we verify that 
is bounded by showing that 
for all . (Since the
sequence is increasing, we already know that it has a lower bound:
for 
all .) We know that 
, so the assertion is true for 
. Suppose it is true for
. Then
so
and
Thus
This shows, by mathematical induction, that

Since the sequence 
is increasing and bounded, the Monotonic Sequence
Theorem guarantees that it has a limit. The theorem doesn’t tell us what the value of
the limit is. But now that we know 
exists, we can use the given recur-
rence relation to write
Since

Logistic Sequences
A sequence that arises in ecology as a model for population growth is deﬁned by the logis-
tic difference equation
where 
measures the size of the population of the 
generation of a single species. To
keep the numbers manageable,
is a fraction of the maximal size of the population, so
. Notice that the form of this equation is similar to the logistic differential equa-
tion in Section 7.5. The discrete model—with sequences instead of continuous functions—is
preferable for modeling insect populations, where mating and death occur in a periodic
fashion.
An ecologist is interested in predicting the size of the population as time goes on,
and asks these questions: Will it stabilize at a limiting value? Will it change in a cyclical
fashion? Or will it exhibit random behavior?
Write a program to compute the ﬁrst 
terms of this sequence starting with an initial
population 
. Use this program to do the following.
1. Calculate 20 or 30 terms of the sequence for 
and for two values of such that
. Graph the sequences. Do they appear to converge? Repeat for a different
value of 
between 0 and 1. Does the limit depend on the choice of 
? Does it depend
on the choice of ?
2. Calculate terms of the sequence for a value of between 3 and 3.4 and plot them. What
do you notice about the behavior of the terms?
3. Experiment with values of between 3.4 and 3.5. What happens to the terms?
4. For values of between 3.6 and 4, compute and plot at least 100 terms and comment on
the behavior of the sequence. What happens if you change 
by 0.001? This type of
behavior is called chaotic and is exhibited by insect populations under certain conditions.

If we try to add the terms of an inﬁnite sequence 
we get an expression of the
form
which is called an inﬁnite series (or just a series) and is denoted, for short, by the
symbol
But does it make sense to talk about the sum of inﬁnitely many terms?
It would be impossible to ﬁnd a ﬁnite sum for the series
because if we start adding the terms we get the cumulative sums 1, 3, 6, 10, 15,
21, . . . and, after the 
term,
, which becomes very large as 
increases.

However, if we start to add the terms of the series
we get , , ,
,
,
, . . . ,
, . . . . The table shows that as we add more and
more terms, these partial sums become closer and closer to 1. (See also Figure 11 in
A Preview of Calculus, page 7.) In fact, by adding sufﬁciently many terms of the series
we can make the partial sums as close as we like to 1. So it seems reasonable to say
that the sum of this inﬁnite series is 1 and to write
We use a similar idea to determine whether or not a general series (1) has a sum.
We consider the partial sums
and, in general,
These partial sums form a new sequence 
, which may or may not have a limit. If
exists (as a ﬁnite number), then, as in the preceding example, we call it
the sum of the inﬁnite series 
.
Definition Given a series 
, let 
denote its
partial sum:
If the sequence 
is convergent and 
exists as a real number,
then the series 
is called convergent and we write
The number is called the sum of the series. If the sequence 
is divergent,
then the series is called divergent.
Thus, the sum of a series is the limit of the sequence of partial sums. So when we
write 
we mean that by adding sufﬁciently many terms of the series we can
get as close as we like to the number . Notice that

EXAMPLE 1 An important example of an inﬁnite series is the geometric series
Each term is obtained from the preceding one by multiplying it by the common ratio .
(We have already considered the special case where 
and 
.)
If 
, then 
. Since 
doesn’t
exist, the geometric series diverges in this case.
If 
, we have
and
Subtracting these equations, we get
If 
, we know from (8.1.6) that 
as 
, so
Thus, when 
the geometric series is convergent and its sum is 
.
If
or 
, the sequence 
is divergent by (8.1.6) and so, by Equation 3,
does not exist. Therefore, the geometric series diverges in those cases.
We summarize the results of Example 1 as follows.
The geometric series
is convergent if 
and its sum is
If 
, the geometric series is divergent.
EXAMPLE 2 Find the sum of the geometric series

L What do we really mean when we
say that the sum of the series in Example
2 is ? Of course, we can’t literally add
an inﬁnite number of terms, one by one.
But, according to Deﬁnition 2, the total
sum is the limit of the sequence of partial
sums. So, by taking the sum of sufﬁciently
many terms, we can get as close as we
like to the number . The table shows the
ﬁrst ten partial sums 
and the graph in
Figure 2 shows how the sequence of par-
tial sums approaches .

EXAMPLE 6 Show that the series 
is convergent, and ﬁnd its sum.
SOLUTION This is not a geometric series, so we go back to the deﬁnition of a conver-
gent series and compute the partial sums.
We can simplify this expression if we use the partial fraction decomposition
(see Section 5.7). Thus, we have
and so
Therefore, the given series is convergent and

This shows that

series diverges.

Proof Let

G With any series
we associate two sequences: the sequence 
of its
partial sums and the sequence 
of its terms. If

the sequence 
is (the sum of the series) and, as Theorem 6 asserts, the limit of the
sequence 
is 0.

NOTE 2
G The converse of Theorem 6 is not true in general. If

cannot conclude that 
is convergent. Observe that for the harmonic series 
we have 
as 
, but we showed in Example 7 that 
is divergent.
The Test for Divergence If 
does not exist or if 
, then the
series 
is divergent.
The Test for Divergence follows from Theorem 6 because, if the series is not diver-
gent, then it is convergent, and so 
.
EXAMPLE 8 Show that the series 
diverges.
SOLUTION
So the series diverges by the Test for Divergence.
NOTE 3
G If we ﬁnd that

is divergent. If we ﬁnd
that 
, we know nothing about the convergence or divergence of

Remember the warning in Note 2: If

might converge or
it might diverge.

receive the money also spend some of it. The people receiv-
ing some of the twice-spent money will spend some of that,
and so on. Economists call this chain reaction the multiplier
effect. In a hypothetical isolated community, the local gov-
ernment begins the process by spending 
dollars. Suppose
that each recipient of spent money spends 
and saves
of the money that he or she receives. The values 
and s are called the marginal propensity to consume and the
marginal propensity to save and, of course,

The Integral and Comparison Tests; Estimating Sums

In general, it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd the exact sum of a series. We were able to accomplish
this for geometric series and the series 
because in each of those cases
we could ﬁnd a simple formula for the 
partial sum 
. But usually it is not easy 
to compute 
. Therefore, in this section and the next we develop tests that
enable us to determine whether a series is convergent or divergent without explicitly
ﬁnding its sum. In some cases, however, our methods will enable us to ﬁnd good esti-
mates of the sum.
In this section we deal only with series with positive terms, so the partial sums are
increasing. In view of the Monotonic Sequence Theorem, to decide whether a series
is convergent or divergent, we need to determine whether the partial sums are bounded
or not.
Testing with an Integral
Let’s investigate the series whose terms are the reciprocals of the squares of the posi-
tive integers:
There’s no simple formula for the sum 
of the ﬁrst 
terms, but the computer-
generated table of values given in the margin suggests that the partial sums are
approaching a number near 1.64 as 
and so it looks as if the series is convergent.
We can conﬁrm this impression with a geometric argument. Figure 1 shows the
curve 
and rectangles that lie below the curve. The base of each rectangle is
an interval of length 1; the height is equal to the value of the function 
at the
right endpoint of the interval. So the sum of the areas of the rectangles is
If we exclude the ﬁrst rectangle, the total area of the remaining rectangles is
smaller than the area under the curve 
for 
, which is the value of the
integral 
. In Section 5.10 we discovered that this improper integral is con-
vergent and has value 1. So the picture shows that all the partial sums are less than

Thus, the partial sums are bounded and the series converges. The sum of the series (the
limit of the partial sums) is also less than 2:
[The exact sum of this series was found by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler
(1707–1783) to be 
, but the proof of this fact is beyond the scope of this book.]
Now let’s look at the series
The table of values of 
suggests that the partial sums aren’t approaching a ﬁnite num-
ber, so we suspect that the given series may be divergent. Again we use a picture for
conﬁrmation. Figure 2 shows the curve 
, but this time we use rectangles
whose tops lie above the curve.
The base of each rectangle is an interval of length 1. The height is equal to the
value of the function 
at the left endpoint of the interval. So the sum of the
areas of all the rectangles is
This total area is greater than the area under the curve 
for 
, which is
equal to the integral 
. But we know from Section 5.10 that this improper
integral is divergent. In other words, the area under the curve is inﬁnite. So the sum of
the series must be inﬁnite, that is, the series is divergent.
The same sort of geometric reasoning that we used for these two series can be used
to prove the following test.
The Integral Test Suppose 
is a continuous, positive, decreasing function on
and let 
. Then the series 
is convergent if and only if the
improper integral 
is convergent. In other words:
(a) If 
is convergent, then 
is convergent.
(b) If 
is divergent, then 
is divergent.

EXAMPLE 1 Determine whether the series

the logarithm function is continuous. But it is not obvious whether or not

Thus,

and so we can apply the Integral Test:
Since this improper integral is divergent, the series

the Integral Test.

Divergence [see (8.2.7)].

It follows from the Integral Test that the series

diverges if

, this series is the harmonic series discussed in
Example 7 in Section 8.2.)

chapter, so we summarize the results of Example 2 for future reference as follows.

For instance, the series
is convergent because it is a p-series with 
. But the series
is divergent because it is a p-series with 
.
Testing by Comparing
The series
reminds us of the series 
, which is a geometric series with 
and 
and is therefore convergent. Because the series (2) is so similar to a convergent series,
we have the feeling that it too must be convergent. Indeed, it is. The inequality
shows that our given series (2) has smaller terms than those of the geometric series
and therefore all its partial sums are also smaller than 1 (the sum of the geometric
series). This means that its partial sums form a bounded increasing sequence, which
is convergent. It also follows that the sum of the series is less than the sum of the 
geometric series:
Similar reasoning can be used to prove the following test, which applies only to
series whose terms are positive. The ﬁrst part says that if we have a series whose terms
are smaller than those of a known convergent series, then our series is also convergent.
The second part says that if we start with a series whose terms are larger than those
of a known divergent series, then it too is divergent.
The Comparison Test Suppose that 
and 
are series with positive terms.
(a) If 
is convergent and 
for all , then 
is also convergent.
(b) If 
is divergent and 
for all , then 
is also divergent.
In using the Comparison Test we must, of course, have some known series 
for
the purpose of comparison. Most of the time we use either a -series [
con-
verges if 
and diverges if 
; see (1)] or a geometric series [
con-
verges if 
and diverges if 
; see (8.2.4)].

EXAMPLE 3 Determine whether the series 
converges or diverges.
SOLUTION For large 
the dominant term in the denominator is 
, so we compare the
given series with the series 
. Observe that
because the left side has a bigger denominator. (In the notation of the Comparison
Test,

is the right side.) We know that

). Therefore
is convergent by part (a) of the Comparison Test.
Although the condition 
or 
in the Comparison Test is given for all
, we need verify only that it holds for 
, where 
is some ﬁxed integer, because
the convergence of a series is not affected by a ﬁnite number of terms. This is illus-
trated in the next example.
EXAMPLE 4 Test the series 
for convergence or divergence.
SOLUTION We used the Integral Test to test this series in Example 1, but we can also
test it by comparing it with the harmonic series. Observe that

and so
We know that 
is divergent ( -series with 
). Thus, the given series is
divergent by the Comparison Test.
NOTE
G The terms of the series being tested must be smaller than those of a conver-
gent series or larger than those of a divergent series. If the terms are larger than the
terms of a convergent series or smaller than those of a divergent series, then the Com-
parison Test doesn’t apply. Consider, for instance, the series

cases the following test can be used.
The Limit Comparison Test Suppose that

terms. If

both diverge.
Although we won’t prove the Limit Comparison Test, it seems reasonable because

SOLUTION We use the Limit Comparison Test with
and obtain
Since this limit exists and 
is a convergent geometric series, the given series
converges by the Limit Comparison Test.
Estimating the Sum of a Series
Suppose we have been able to use the Integral Test to show that a series 
is con-
vergent and we now want to ﬁnd an approximation to the sum 
of the series. 
Of course, any partial sum 
is an approximation to 
because 
. But 
how good is such an approximation? To ﬁnd out, we need to estimate the size of the
remainder
The remainder 
is the error made when , the sum of the ﬁrst terms, is used as an
approximation to the total sum.
We use the same notation and ideas as in the Integral Test. Comparing the areas of
the rectangles with the area under 
for 
in Figure 3, we see that
Similarly, we see from Figure 4 that

So we have proved the following error estimate.

converges by the Integral Test
and

EXAMPLE 6
(a) Approximate the sum of the series 
by using the sum of the ﬁrst 10 terms.
Estimate the error involved in this approximation. 
(b) How many terms are required to ensure that the sum is accurate to within 
?
SOLUTION In both parts (a) and (b) we need to know 
. With 
,
we have
(a)
According to the remainder estimate in (3), we have
So the size of the error is at most 
.
(b) Accuracy to within 
means that we have to ﬁnd a value of such that
. Since
we want
Solving this inequality, we get
We need 32 terms to ensure accuracy to within 
.
If we add 
to each side of the inequalities in (3), we get

because 
. The inequalities in (4) give a lower bound and an upper bound
for . They provide a more accurate approximation to the sum of the series than the
partial sum 
does.
EXAMPLE 7 Use (4) with 
to estimate the sum of the series 
.
SOLUTION The inequalities in (4) become
From Example 6 we know that
so
Using 
, we get
If we approximate by the midpoint of this interval, then the error is at most half
the length of the interval. So
If we compare Example 7 with Example 6, we see that the improved estimate in
(4) can be much better than the estimate 
. To make the error smaller than 
we had to use 32 terms in Example 6 but only 10 terms in Example 7.
If we have used the Comparison Test to show that a series 
converges by com-
parison with a series 
, then we may be able to estimate the sum 
by compar-
ing remainders, as the following example shows.
EXAMPLE 8 Use the sum of the ﬁrst 100 terms to approximate the sum of the series
. Estimate the error involved in this approximation.
SOLUTION Since
the given series is convergent by the Comparison Test. The remainder 
for the
comparison series

The convergence tests that we have looked at so far apply only to series with positive
terms. In this section we learn how to deal with series whose terms are not necessarily
positive.
Alternating Series
An alternating series is a series whose terms are alternately positive and negative.
Here are two examples:
We see from these examples that the 
term of an alternating series is of the form
where 
is a positive number. (In fact,
.)
The following test says that if the terms of an alternating series decrease to 0 in
absolute value, then the series converges.

CHAPTER 8 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES

The Alternating Series Test If the alternating series
satisﬁes
(a)
(b)
then the series is convergent.
We won’t present a formal proof of this test, but Figure 1 gives a picture of the idea
behind the proof. We ﬁrst plot 
on a number line. To ﬁnd 
we subtract 
, so
is to the left of 
. Then to ﬁnd 
we add 
, so 
is to the right of 
. But, since
,
is to the left of . Continuing in this manner, we see that the partial sums
oscillate back and forth. Since 
, the successive steps are becoming smaller and
smaller. The even partial sums 
,
,
, . . . are increasing and the odd partial sums 
,
,
, . . . are decreasing. Thus, it seems plausible that both are converging to some
number , which is the sum of the series.
EXAMPLE 1 The alternating harmonic series
satisﬁes
(a)
because
(b)
so the series is convergent by the Alternating Series Test.

is alternating, but

so condition (b) is not satisﬁed. Instead, we look at the limit of the
term of the
series:
This limit does not exist, so the series diverges by the Test for Divergence.
EXAMPLE 3 Test the series 
for convergence or divergence.
SOLUTION The given series is alternating so we try to verify conditions (a) and (b) of
the Alternating Series Test.
Unlike the situation in Example 1, it is not obvious that the sequence given by
is decreasing. However, if we consider the related function
, we ﬁnd that
Since we are considering only positive , we see that 
if 
,
that is,
. Thus,
is decreasing on the interval 
. This means that
and therefore 
when 
. (The inequality 
can
be veriﬁed directly but all that really matters is that the sequence 
is eventually
decreasing.)
Condition (b) is readily veriﬁed:
Thus, the given series is convergent by the Alternating Series Test.
The error involved in using the partial sum 
as an approximation to the total sum
is the remainder 
. The next theorem says that for series that satisfy the
conditions of the Alternating Series Test, the size of the error is smaller than 
,
which is the absolute value of the ﬁrst neglected term.
Alternating Series Estimation Theorem If 
is the sum of an alter-
nating series that satisﬁes
(a)
and
(b)
then
You can see geometrically why this is true by looking at Figure 1. Notice that

CHAPTER 8 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
L Instead of verifying condition (a) of
the Alternating Series Test by computing
a derivative, we could verify that
directly by using the tech-
nique of Solution 1 of Example 10 in
Section 8.1.

SOLUTION We ﬁrst observe that the series is convergent by the Alternating Series Test
because
(a)
(b)
so
as
To get a feel for how many terms we need to use in our approximation, let’s write
out the ﬁrst few terms of the series:
Notice that
and
By the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem we know that
This error of less than 
does not affect the third decimal place, so we have
correct to three decimal places.
In Section 8.7 we will prove that 
for all , so what we have
obtained in this example is actually an approximation to the number 
.
|
NOTE
G The rule that the error (in using 
to approximate ) is smaller than the ﬁrst
neglected term is, in general, valid only for alternating series that satisfy the condi-
tions of the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem. The rule does not apply to other
types of series.
Absolute Convergence
Given any series 
, we can consider the corresponding series
whose terms are the absolute values of the terms of the original series.
Definition A series 
is called absolutely convergent if the series of
absolute values 
is convergent.
Notice that if 
is a series with positive terms, then 
and so absolute
convergence is the same as convergence.

L We have convergence tests for series
with positive terms and for alternating
series. But what if the signs of the terms
switch back and forth irregularly? We
will see in Example 7 that the idea of
absolute convergence sometimes helps in
such cases.

EXAMPLE 5 The series
is absolutely convergent because
is a convergent -series (
).
EXAMPLE 6 We know that the alternating harmonic series
is convergent (see Example 1), but it is not absolutely convergent because the corre-
sponding series of absolute values is
which is the harmonic series ( -series with 
) and is therefore divergent.
Example 6 shows that it is possible for a series to be convergent but not absolutely
convergent. However, the following theorem shows that absolute convergence implies
convergence.
Theorem If a series 
is absolutely convergent, then it is convergent.
To see why Theorem 1 is true, observe that the inequality
is true because 
is either 
or 
. If 
is absolutely convergent, then 
is convergent, so 
is convergent. Therefore, by the Comparison Test,
is convergent. Then
is the difference of two convergent series and is therefore convergent.

is convergent or divergent.

CHAPTER 8 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES

SOLUTION This series has both positive and negative terms, but it is not alternating. 
(The ﬁrst term is positive, the next three are negative, and the following three are
positive. The signs change irregularly.) We can apply the Comparison Test to the
series of absolute values
Since 
for all , we have
We know that 
is convergent ( -series with 
) and therefore 
is convergent by the Comparison Test. Thus, the given series 
is
absolutely convergent and therefore convergent by Theorem 1.
The Ratio Test
The following test is very useful in determining whether a given series is absolutely
convergent.
The Ratio Test
(a) If 
, then the series 
is absolutely convergent 
(and therefore convergent).
(b) If 
or
, then the series 
is divergent.
The Ratio Test can be proved by comparing the given series to a geometric series.
It’s understandable that geometric series are involved because, for those series, the
ratio of consecutive terms is constant and the series converges if 
. In part (a)
of the Ratio Test, the ratio of consecutive terms isn’t constant but 
so,
for large ,
is almost constant and the series converges if 
.
NOTE
G If 
, the Ratio Test gives no information. For instance,
for the convergent series 
we have
whereas for the divergent series 
we have

Thus, by the Ratio Test, the given series is absolutely convergent and therefore 
convergent.

products (including a constant raised to

tested using the Ratio Test.

L Estimating Sums
We have used various methods for esti-
mating the sum of a series—the method
depended on which test was used to
prove convergence. What about series
for which the Ratio Test works? There are
two possibilities: If the series happens to
be an alternating series, as in Example
8, then it is best to use the Alternating
Series Estimation Theorem. If the terms
are all positive, then use the special
methods explained in Exercise 34.

A power series is a series of the form
where is a variable and the ’s are constants called the coefﬁcients of the series. For
each ﬁxed , the series (1) is a series of constants that we can test for convergence or
divergence. A power series may converge for some values of 
and diverge for other
values of . The sum of the series is a function
whose domain is the set of all for which the series converges. Notice that resembles
a polynomial. The only difference is that 
has inﬁnitely many terms.
For instance, if we take 
for all , the power series becomes the geometric
series
which converges when 
and diverges when 
(see Equation 8.2.5).
More generally, a series of the form
is called a power series in 
or a power series centered at a or a power series
about a. Notice that in writing out the term corresponding to 
in Equations 1
and 2 we have adopted the convention that 
even when 
. Notice
also that when 
all of the terms are 0 for 
and so the power series (2)
always converges when 
.
EXAMPLE 1 For what values of is the series 
convergent?
SOLUTION We use the Ratio Test. If we let 
, as usual, denote the nth term of the
series, then 
. If 
, we have
By the Ratio Test, the series diverges when 
. Thus, the given series converges
only when

EXAMPLE 2 For what values of does the series 
converge?
SOLUTION Let 
. Then
By the Ratio Test, the given series is absolutely convergent, and therefore conver-
gent, when 
and divergent when 
. Now
so the series converges when 
and diverges when 
or 
.
The Ratio Test gives no information when 
so we must consider
and 
separately. If we put 
in the series, it becomes 
, the
harmonic series, which is divergent. If 
, the series is 
, which con-
verges by the Alternating Series Test. Thus, the given power series converges for
.
We will see that the main use of a power series is that it provides a way to repre-
sent some of the most important functions that arise in mathematics, physics, and
chemistry. In particular, the sum of the power series in the next example is called a
Bessel function, after the German astronomer Friedrich Bessel (1784–1846), and the
function given in Exercise 23 is another example of a Bessel function. In fact, these
functions ﬁrst arose when Bessel solved Kepler’s equation for describing planetary
motion. Since that time, these functions have been applied in many different physical
situations, including the temperature distribution in a circular plate and the shape of a
vibrating drumhead.
EXAMPLE 3 Find the domain of the Bessel function of order 0 deﬁned by
SOLUTION Let 
. Then
Thus, by the Ratio Test, the given series converges for all values of . In other
words, the domain of the Bessel function 
is 
.
Recall that the sum of a series is equal to the limit of the sequence of partial sums.
So when we deﬁne the Bessel function in Example 3 as the sum of a series we mean

Figure 1 shows the graphs of these partial sums, which are polynomials. They are all
approximations to the function 
, but notice that the approximations become better
when more terms are included. Figure 2 shows a more complete graph of the Bessel
function.
For the power series that we have looked at so far, the set of values of for which
the series is convergent has always turned out to be an interval [a ﬁnite interval for the 
geometric series and the series in Example 2, the inﬁnite interval 
in Example
3, and a collapsed interval 
in Example 1]. The following theorem, which
we won’t prove, says that this is true in general.
Theorem For a given power series 
there are only three 
possibilities:
(i) The series converges only when 
.
(ii) The series converges for all .
(iii) There is a positive number 
such that the series converges if
and diverges if 
.
The number 
in case (iii) is called the radius of convergence of the power series.
By convention, the radius of convergence is 
in case (i) and 
in case (ii).
The interval of convergence of a power series is the interval that consists of all val-
ues of 
for which the series converges. In case (i) the interval consists of just a 
single point . In case (ii) the interval is 
. In case (iii) note that the inequality
can be rewritten as 
. When 
is an endpoint of the
interval, that is,
, anything can happen—the series might converge at one
or both endpoints or it might diverge at both endpoints. Thus, in case (iii) there are
four possibilities for the interval of convergence:
The situation is illustrated in Figure 3.

We summarize here the radius and interval of convergence for each of the examples
already considered in this section.
The Ratio Test can be used to determine the radius of convergence 
in most cases.
The Ratio Test always fails when 
is an endpoint of the interval of convergence, so
the endpoints must be checked with some other test.

By the Ratio Test, the given series converges if

Thus, it converges if

. This means that the radius of 
convergence is 
.
We know the series converges in the interval 
, but we must now test for 
convergence at the endpoints of this interval. If 
, the series becomes
which diverges. (Use the Integral Test or simply observe that it is a -series with
.) If 
, the series is
which converges by the Alternating Series Test. Therefore, the given power series
converges when 
, so the interval of convergence is 
.

EXAMPLE 5 Find the radius of convergence and interval of convergence of the series
SOLUTION If 
, then
Using the Ratio Test, we see that the series converges if 
and it
diverges if 
. So it converges if 
and diverges if
. Thus, the radius of convergence is 
.
The inequality 
can be written as 
, so we test the series
at the endpoints 
and 1. When 
, the series is
which diverges by the Test for Divergence [
doesn’t converge to 0]. When
, the series is
which also diverges by the Test for Divergence. Thus, the series converges only
when 
, so the interval of convergence is 
.

Representations of Functions as Power Series
G

In this section we learn how to represent certain types of functions as sums of power
series by manipulating geometric series or by differentiating or integrating such a
series. You might wonder why we would ever want to express a known function as a
sum of inﬁnitely many terms. We will see later that this strategy is useful for inte-
grating functions that don’t have elementary antiderivatives, for solving differential
equations, and for approximating functions by polynomials. (Scientists do this to sim-
plify the expressions they deal with; computer scientists do this to represent functions
on calculators and computers.)
We start with an equation that we have seen before:
We ﬁrst encountered this equation in Example 5 in Section 8.2, where we obtained it
by observing that the series is a geometric series with 
and 
. But here our
point of view is different. We now regard Equation 1 as expressing the function
as a sum of a power series.
EXAMPLE 1 Express 
as the sum of a power series and ﬁnd the interval of
convergence.
SOLUTION Replacing by 
in Equation 1, we have

Because this is a geometric series, it converges when 
, that is,
, or
. Therefore, the interval of convergence is 
. (Of course, we could
have determined the radius of convergence by applying the Ratio Test, but that much
work is unnecessary here.)
EXAMPLE 2 Find a power series representation for

SOLUTION In order to put this function in the form of the left side of Equation 1 we
ﬁrst factor a 2 from the denominator:
This series converges when 
, that is,
. So the interval of conver-
gence is 
.
EXAMPLE 3 Find a power series representation of

SOLUTION Since this function is just 
times the function in Example 2, all we have to
do is to multiply that series by 
:
Another way of writing this series is as follows:
As in Example 2, the interval of convergence is 
.
Differentiation and Integration of Power Series
The sum of a power series is a function 
whose domain is the
interval of convergence of the series. We would like to be able to differentiate and inte-
grate such functions, and the following theorem (which we won’t prove) says that we
can do so by differentiating or integrating each individual term in the series, just as we
would for a polynomial. This is called term-by-term differentiation and integration.

Theorem If the power series 
has radius of convergence 
,
then the function 
deﬁned by
is differentiable (and therefore continuous) on the interval 
and
(i)
(ii)
The radii of convergence of the power series in Equations (i) and (ii) are both .
NOTE 1
G Equations (i) and (ii) in Theorem 2 can be rewritten in the form
(iii)
(iv)
We know that, for ﬁnite sums, the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives and
the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals. Equations (iii) and (iv) assert that the
same is true for inﬁnite sums, provided we are dealing with power series. (For other
types of series of functions the situation is not as simple; see Exercise 34.)
NOTE 2
G Although Theorem 2 says that the radius of convergence remains the same
when a power series is differentiated or integrated, this does not mean that the inter-
val of convergence remains the same. It may happen that the original series converges
at an endpoint, whereas the differentiated series diverges there. (See Exercise 35.)
NOTE 3
G The idea of differentiating a power series term by term is the basis for a
powerful method for solving differential equations. We will discuss this method in Sec-
tion 8.10.
EXAMPLE 4 In Example 3 in Section 8.5 we saw that the Bessel function
is deﬁned for all . Thus, by Theorem 2,

tive is found by term-by-term differentiation as follows:

SOLUTION Differentiating each side of the equation

If we wish, we can replace n by n  1 and write the answer as
According to Theorem 2, the radius of convergence of the differentiated series is the

CHAPTER 8 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES

To ﬁnd 
we put 
and obtain 
. Therefore
Since the radius of convergence of the series for 
is 1, the radius of con-
vergence of this series for 
is also 1.
EXAMPLE 8
(a) Evaluate 
as a power series.
(b) Use part (a) to approximate 
correct to within 
.
SOLUTION
(a) The ﬁrst step is to express the integrand,
, as the sum of a power
series. As in Example 1, we start with Equation 1 and replace by 
:
Now we integrate term by term:
This series converges for 
, that is, for 
.
(b) In applying the Evaluation Theorem it doesn’t matter which antiderivative we
use, so let’s use the antiderivative from part (a) with 
:
This inﬁnite series is the exact value of the deﬁnite integral, but since it is an alter-
nating series, we can approximate the sum using the Alternating Series Estimation
Theorem. If we stop adding after the term with 
, the error is smaller than the
term with 
:
So we have

L This example demonstrates one way
in which power series representations
are useful. Integrating 
by
hand is incredibly difﬁcult. Different com-
puter algebra systems return different
forms of the answer, but they are all
extremely complicated. (If you have a
CAS, try it yourself.) The inﬁnite series
answer that we obtain in Example 8(a) 
is actually much easier to deal with than
the ﬁnite answer provided by a CAS.

in Example 7 is called Gregory’s series
after the Scottish mathematician James
Gregory (1638–1675), who had anti-

We have shown that Gregory’s series is
valid when 
, but it turns out
(although it isn’t easy to prove) that it is
also valid when

In the preceding section we were able to ﬁnd power series representations for a cer-
tain restricted class of functions. Here we investigate more general problems: Which
functions have power series representations? How can we ﬁnd such representations?
We start by supposing that is any function that can be represented by a power series
Let’s try to determine what the coefﬁcients 
must be in terms of . To begin, notice
that if we put 
in Equation 1, then all terms after the ﬁrst one are 0 and we get
By Theorem 8.6.2, we can differentiate the series in Equation 1 term by term:
and substitution of 
in Equation 2 gives
Now we differentiate both sides of Equation 2 and obtain
Again we put 
in Equation 3. The result is

Let’s apply the procedure one more time. Differentiation of the series in Equation 3
gives
and substitution of 
in Equation 4 gives
By now you can see the pattern. If we continue to differentiate and substitute 
,
we obtain
Solving this equation for the th coefﬁcient 
This formula remains valid even for 
if we adopt the conventions that

. Thus, we have proved the following theorem.
Theorem If

then its coefﬁcients are given by the formula
Substituting this formula for 
back into the series, we see that if
has a power
series expansion at , then it must be of the following form.
The series in Equation 6 is called the Taylor series of the function 
at a (or
about a or centered at a). For the special case 
the Taylor series becomes
This case arises frequently enough that it is given the special name Maclaurin series.

CHAPTER 8 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
L The Taylor series is named after the
English mathematician Brook Taylor
(1685–1731) and the Maclaurin series
is named in honor of the Scottish mathe-
matician Colin Maclaurin (1698–1746)
despite the fact that the Maclaurin series
is really just a special case of the Taylor
series. But the idea of representing par-
ticular functions as sums of power series
goes back to Newton, and the general
Taylor series was known to the Scottish
mathematician James Gregory in 1668
and to the Swiss mathematician John
Bernoulli in the 1690s. Taylor was
apparently unaware of the work of Greg-
ory and Bernoulli when he published his
discoveries on series in 1715 in his
book Methodus incrementorum directa 
et inversa. Maclaurin series are named
after Colin Maclaurin because he pop-
ularized them in his calculus textbook 
Treatise of Fluxions published in 1742.

NOTE
G We have shown that if
can be represented as a power series about , then
is equal to the sum of its Taylor series. But there exist functions that are not equal
to the sum of their Taylor series. An example of such a function is given in Exercise 54.
EXAMPLE 1 Find the Maclaurin series of the function 
and its radius of 
convergence.
SOLUTION If 
, then 
, so 
for all . Therefore, the
Taylor series for 
at 0 (that is, the Maclaurin series) is
To ﬁnd the radius of convergence we let 
. Then
so, by the Ratio Test, the series converges for all and the radius of convergence
is
.
The conclusion we can draw from Theorem 5 and Example 1 is that if
has a
power series expansion at 0, then
So how can we determine whether 
does have a power series representation?
Let’s investigate the more general question: Under what circumstances is a func-
tion equal to the sum of its Taylor series? In other words, if 
has derivatives of all
orders, when is it true that
As with any convergent series, this means that 
is the limit of the sequence of par-
tial sums. In the case of the Taylor series, the partial sums are
Notice that 
is a polynomial of degree 
called the nth-degree Taylor polynomial
of
at a. For instance, for the exponential function 
, the result of Example 1
shows that the Taylor polynomials at 0 (or Maclaurin polynomials) with 
, 2, and
3 are
The graphs of the exponential function and these three Taylor polynomials are drawn
in Figure 1.

Although we have assumed that

This proves Taylor’s Inequality for the case where

NOTE
G In Section 8.9 we will explore the use of Taylor’s Inequality in approximat-

In applying Theorems 8 and 9 it is often helpful to make use of the following fact.

In particular, if we put

for the number as a sum of an inﬁnite series:

SOLUTION We have 
and so, putting 
in the deﬁnition of a Taylor
series (6), we get
Again it can be veriﬁed, as in Example 1, that the radius of convergence is 
.
As in Example 2 we can verify that 
, so
We have two power series expansions for 
, the Maclaurin series in Equation 11
and the Taylor series in Equation 13. The ﬁrst is better if we are interested in values
of near 0 and the second is better if is near 2.
EXAMPLE 4 Find the Maclaurin series for

all .
SOLUTION We arrange our computation in two columns as follows:
Since the derivatives repeat in a cycle of four, we can write the Maclaurin series as 
follows:
Since

SOLUTION We could proceed directly as in Example 4 but it’s easier to differentiate the
Maclaurin series for 
given by Equation 15:
Since the Maclaurin series for 
converges for all , Theorem 8.6.2 tells us that
the differentiated series for 
also converges for all . Thus

to multiply the series for

L The Maclaurin series for

, and
that we found in Examples 2, 4,
and 5 were ﬁrst discovered, using differ-
ent methods, by Newton. These equa-
tions are remarkable because they say
we know everything about each of these
functions if we know all its derivatives at
the single number .

and this pattern repeats indeﬁnitely. Therefore, the Taylor series at 
is
The proof that this series represents 
for all is very similar to that in Example 4.
[Just replace by 
in (14).] We can write the series in sigma notation if we
separate the terms that contain 
:
The power series that we obtained by indirect methods in Examples 5 and 6 and 
in Section 8.6 are indeed the Taylor or Maclaurin series of the given functions 
because Theorem 5 asserts that, no matter how we obtain a power series representa-
tion 
, it is always true that 
. In other words, the coef-
ﬁcients are uniquely determined.
We collect in the following table, for future reference, some important Maclaurin
series that we have derived in this section and the preceding one.
One reason that Taylor series are important is that they enable us to integrate func-
tions that we couldn’t previously handle. In fact, in the introduction to this chapter we
mentioned that Newton often integrated functions by ﬁrst expressing them as power
series and then integrating the series term by term. The function 
can’t be
integrated by techniques discussed so far because its antiderivative is not an elemen-
tary function (see Section 5.8). In the following example we use Newton’s idea to inte-
grate this function.

CHAPTER 8 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
Important Maclaurin series and 
their intervals of convergence
L We have obtained two different
series representations for 
, the
Maclaurin series in Example 4 and the
Taylor series in Example 7. It is best to
use the Maclaurin series for values of 
near 
and the Taylor series for 
near 
. Notice that the third Taylor
polynomial 
in Figure 3 is a good
approximation to 
near 
but 
not as good near . Compare it with
the third Maclaurin polynomial 
in
Figure 2, where the opposite is true.

SOLUTION
(a) First we ﬁnd the Maclaurin series for 
. Although it’s possible to use
the direct method, let’s ﬁnd it simply by replacing with 
in the series for 
given in the table of Maclaurin series. Thus, for all values of x,
Now we integrate term by term:
This series converges for all because the original series for 
converges for all .
(b) The Evaluation Theorem gives
The Alternating Series Estimation Theorem shows that the error involved in this
approximation is less than
Another use of Taylor series is illustrated in the next example. The limit could be
found with l’Hospital’s Rule, but instead we use a series.

because power series are continuous functions.

Multiplication and Division of Power Series
If power series are added or subtracted, they behave like polynomials (Theorem 8.2.8
shows this). In fact, as the following example illustrates, they can also be multiplied
and divided like polynomials. We ﬁnd only the ﬁrst few terms because the calculations
for the later terms become tedious and the initial terms are the most important ones.
EXAMPLE 10 Find the ﬁrst three nonzero terms in the Maclaurin series for (a) 
and (b) 
.
SOLUTION
(a) Using the Maclaurin series for 
and 
in the table, we have
We multiply these expressions, collecting like terms just as for polynomials:
Thus
(b) Using the Maclaurin series in the table, we have
We use a procedure like long division:
Thus
Although we have not attempted to justify the formal manipulations used in Exam-
ple 10, they are legitimate. There is a theorem which states that if both 
and 
converge for 
and the series are multiplied as if they were
polynomials, then the resulting series also converges for 
and represents
. For division we require 
; the resulting series converges for sufﬁciently
small 
.

You may be acquainted with the Binomial Theorem, which states that if

any real numbers and is a positive integer, then
The traditional notation for the binomial coefﬁcients is
which enables us to write the Binomial Theorem in the abbreviated form
In particular, if we put

One of Newton’s accomplishments was to extend the Binomial Theorem (Equation 1)
to the case in which

CHAPTER 8 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES
How Newton Discovered the Binomial Series
The Binomial Theorem, which gives the expansion of 
, was known to Chinese
mathematicians many centuries before the time of Newton for the case where the exponent
is a positive integer. In 1665, when he was 22, Newton was the ﬁrst to discover the inﬁnite
series expansion of 
when is a fractional exponent (positive or negative). He didn’t
publish his discovery, but he stated it and gave examples of how to use it in a letter (now
called the epistola prior) dated June 13, 1676, that he sent to Henry Oldenburg, secretary of
the Royal Society of London, to transmit to Leibniz. When Leibniz replied, he asked how
Newton had discovered the binomial series. Newton wrote a second letter, the epistola
posterior of October 24, 1676, in which he explained in great detail how he arrived at 
his discovery by a very indirect route. He was investigating the areas under the curves
from 0 to for 
, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . . These are easy to calculate if is
even. By observing patterns and interpolating, Newton was able to guess the answers for
odd values of . Then he realized he could get the same answers by expressing 
as an inﬁnite series.
Write a report on Newton’s discovery of the binomial series. Start by giving the state-
ment of the binomial series in Newton’s notation (see the epistola prior on page 285 of 
[4] or page 402 of [2]). Explain why Newton’s version is equivalent to Theorem 8.8.2 on
page 623. Then read Newton’s epistola posterior (page 287 in [4] or page 404 in [2]) and
explain the patterns that Newton discovered in the areas under the curves 
.
Show how he was able to guess the areas under the remaining curves and how he veriﬁed
his answers. Finally, explain how these discoveries led to the binomial series. The books by
Edwards [1] and Katz [3] contain commentaries on Newton’s letters.

Since 
is the sum of its Taylor series, we know that 
as 
and so 
can be used as an approximation to :
. It is useful to be able to approx-
imate a function by a polynomial because polynomials are the simplest of functions.
In this section we explore the use of such approximations by physical scientists and
computer scientists.
Notice that the ﬁrst-degree Taylor polynomial
is the same as the linearization of 
at a that we discussed in Sections 2.9 and 3.8.
Notice also that 
and its derivative have the same values at a that
and 
have. In
general, it can be shown that the derivatives of 
at agree with those of 
up to and
including derivatives of order .
To illustrate these ideas let’s take another look at the graphs of 
and its ﬁrst
few Taylor polynomials, as shown in Figure 1. The graph of 
is the tangent line to
at 
; this tangent line is the best linear approximation to 
near 
. The
graph of 
is the parabola 
, and the graph of 
is the cubic curve
, which is a closer ﬁt to the exponential curve 
than
. The next Taylor polynomial 
would be an even better approximation, and so on.
The values in the table give a numerical demonstration of the convergence of the
Taylor polynomials 
to the function 
. We see that when x  0.2 the con-
vergence is very rapid, but when x  3 it is somewhat slower. In fact, the farther x is
from 0, the more slowly 
converges to 
.
When using a Taylor polynomial 
to approximate a function , we have to ask
the questions: How good an approximation is it? How large should we take to be in
order to achieve a desired accuracy? To answer these questions we need to look at the
absolute value of the remainder:
There are three possible methods for estimating the size of the error:
1. If a graphing device is available, we can use it to graph 
and thereby
estimate the error.
2. If the series happens to be an alternating series, we can use the Alternating
Series Estimation Theorem.
3. In all cases we can use Taylor’s Inequality (Theorem 8.7.9), which says that if
, then

SOLUTION
(a) Notice that the Maclaurin series
is alternating for all nonzero values of , and the successive terms decrease in size
because 
, so we can use the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem. The
error in approximating

If 
, then 
, so the error is smaller than
To ﬁnd 
we ﬁrst convert to radian measure.
Thus, correct to six decimal places,
.
(b) The error will be smaller than 
if
Solving this inequality for , we get
So the given approximation is accurate to within 
when

What if we use Taylor’s Inequality to solve Example 2? Since 
, we
have 
and so
So we get the same estimates as with the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem.
What about graphical methods? Figure 4 shows the graph of

this is the same estimate that we obtained in the solution to Example 2.
If we had been asked to approximate 
instead of 
in Example 2, it
would have been wise to use the Taylor polynomials at

because they are better approximations to

Figure 6 shows the graphs of the Taylor polynomial approximations
to the sine curve. You can see that as 
increases,
is a good approximation to
on a larger and larger interval.
One use of the type of calculation done in Examples 1 and 2 occurs in calculators
and computers. For instance, when you press the 
or 
key on your calculator, or
when a computer programmer uses a subroutine for a trigonometric or exponential or
Bessel function, in many machines a polynomial approximation is calculated. The
polynomial is often a Taylor polynomial that has been modiﬁed so that the error is
spread more evenly throughout an interval.
Applications to Physics
Taylor polynomials are also used frequently in physics. In order to gain insight into
an equation, a physicist often simpliﬁes a function by considering only the ﬁrst two or
three terms in its Taylor series. In other words, the physicist uses a Taylor polynomial
as an approximation to the function. Taylor’s Inequality can then be used to gauge the
accuracy of the approximation. The following example shows one way in which this
idea is used in special relativity.

Another application to physics occurs in optics. Figure 8 is adapted from Optics,
Second Edition by Eugene Hecht (Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1987), page 133. It
depicts a wave from the point source S meeting a spherical interface of radius R cen-
tered at C. The ray SA is refracted toward P.
Using Fermat’s principle that light travels so as to minimize the time taken, Hecht
derives the equation
where 
and 
are indexes of refraction and 
,
,
, and 
are the distances indi-
cated in Figure 8. By the Law of Cosines, applied to triangles ACS and ACP, we have
Because Equation 1 is cumbersome to work with, Gauss, in 1841, simpliﬁed it by
using the linear approximation 
for small values of 
. (This amounts to
using the Taylor polynomial of degree 1.) Then Equation 1 becomes the following
simpler equation [as you are asked to show in Exercise 24(a)]:
The resulting optical theory is known as Gaussian optics, or ﬁrst-order optics, and has
become the basic theoretical tool used to design lenses.
A more accurate theory is obtained by approximating 
by its Taylor polyno-
mial of degree 3 (which is the same as the Taylor polynomial of degree 2). This takes
into account rays for which 
is not so small, that is, rays that strike the surface at
greater distances h above the axis. In Exercise 24(b) you are asked to use this approxi-

Radiation from the Stars
Any object emits radiation when heated. A blackbody is a system that absorbs all the radia-
tion that falls on it. For instance, a matte black surface or a large cavity with a small hole in
its wall (like a blastfurnace) is a blackbody and emits blackbody radiation. Even the radia-
tion from the Sun is close to being blackbody radiation.
Proposed in the late 19th century, the Rayleigh-Jeans Law expresses the energy density of
blackbody radiation of wavelength 
as
where 
is measured in meters,
is the temperature in kelvins (K), and is Boltzmann’s
constant. The Rayleigh-Jeans Law agrees with experimental measurements for long wave-
lengths but disagrees drastically for short wavelengths. [The law predicts that 
as
but experiments have shown that 
.] This fact is known as the ultraviolet
catastrophe.
In 1900 Max Planck found a better model (known now as Planck’s Law) for blackbody 
radiation:

Many differential equations can’t be solved explicitly in terms of ﬁnite combinations
of simple familiar functions. This is true even for a simple-looking equation like
But it is important to be able to solve equations such as Equation 1 because they arise
from physical problems and, in particular, in connection with the Schrödinger equa-
tion in quantum mechanics. In such a case we use the method of power series; that is,
we look for a solution of the form
The method is to substitute this expression into the differential equation and determine
the values of the coefﬁcients 
Before using power series to solve Equation 1, we illustrate the method on the sim-
pler equation 
in Example 1.
EXAMPLE 1 Use power series to solve the equation

We can differentiate power series term by term, so
In order to compare the expressions for and 
more easily, we rewrite 
as follows:
Substituting the expressions in Equations 2 and 4 into the differential equation, we
obtain
or
If two power series are equal, then the corresponding coefﬁcients must be equal.
Therefore, the coefﬁcients of 
in Equation 5 must be 0:
Equation 6 is called a recursion relation. If 
and 
are known, it allows us to
determine the remaining coefﬁcients recursively by putting

NOTE 2
G In Example 2 we had to assume that the differential equation had a series
solution. But now we could verify directly that the function given by Equation 8 is
indeed a solution.
NOTE 3
G Unlike the situation of Example 1, the power series that arise in the solu-
tion of Example 2 do not deﬁne elementary functions. The functions
and
are perfectly good functions but they can’t be expressed in terms of familiar functions.
We can use these power series expressions for 
and 
to compute approximate val-
ues of the functions and even to graph them. Figure 1 shows the ﬁrst few partial sums
(Taylor polynomials) for 
, and we see how they converge to 
. In
this way we can graph both 
and 
in Figure 2.
NOTE 4
G If we were asked to solve the initial-value problem
we would observe that
This would simplify the calculations in Example 2, since all of the even coefﬁcients
would be 0. The solution to the initial-value problem is

CHAPTER 8 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES

Before you look at the solution of the following example, cover it up and ﬁrst try to
solve the problem yourself.
EXAMPLE Find the sum of the series 
.
SOLUTION The problem-solving principle that is relevant here is recognizing something
familiar. Does the given series look anything like a series that we already know?
Well, it does have some ingredients in common with the Maclaurin series for the
exponential function:
We can make this series look more like our given series by replacing by 
:
But here the exponent in the numerator matches the number in the denominator 
whose factorial is taken. To make that happen in the given series, let’s multiply and
divide by 
:
We see that the series between brackets is just the series for 
with the ﬁrst three
terms missing. So

If you don’t see how to prove this, try the problem-solving strategy of using analogy (see
page 88). Try the special cases 
and 
ﬁrst. If you can see how to prove the
assertion for these cases, then you will probably see how to prove it in general.
5. To construct the snowﬂake curve, start with an equilateral triangle with sides of length . 
Step 1 in the construction is to divide each side into three equal parts, construct an equi-
lateral triangle on the middle part, and then delete the middle part (see the ﬁgure). Step 2
is to repeat Step 1 for each side of the resulting polygon. This process is repeated at each
succeeding step. The snowﬂake curve is the curve that results from repeating this process
indeﬁnitely.
(a) Let ,
, and 
represent the number of sides, the length of a side, and the total
length of the th approximating curve (the curve obtained after Step 
of the con-
struction), respectively. Find formulas for ,

8. Suppose you have a large supply of books, all the same size, and you stack them at the
edge of a table, with each book extending farther beyond the edge of the table than the
one beneath it. Show that it is possible to do this so that the top book extends entirely
beyond the table. In fact, show that the top book can extend any distance at all beyond
the edge of the table if the stack is high enough. Use the following method of stacking:
The top book extends half its length beyond the second book. The second book extends a
quarter of its length beyond the third. The third extends one-sixth of its length beyond the
fourth, and so on. (Try it yourself with a deck of cards.) Consider centers of mass.

To locate a point in a plane, two numbers are necessary. We know that any point 
in the plane can be represented as an ordered pair 
of real numbers, where 
is
the -coordinate and 
is the -coordinate. For this reason, a plane is called two-
dimensional. To locate a point in space, three numbers are required. We represent any
point in space by an ordered triple 
of real numbers.
In order to represent points in space, we ﬁrst choose a ﬁxed point 
(the origin)
and three directed lines through 
that are perpendicular to each other, called the
coordinate axes and labeled the -axis,
-axis, and -axis. Usually we think of the 
- and -axes as being horizontal and the -axis as being vertical, and we draw the ori-
entation of the axes as in Figure 1. The direction of the -axis is determined by the
right-hand rule as illustrated in Figure 2: If you curl the ﬁngers of your right hand
around the -axis in the direction of a 
counterclockwise rotation from the positive
-axis to the positive -axis, then your thumb points in the positive direction of the 
-axis.
The three coordinate axes determine the three coordinate planes illustrated in Fig-
ure 3(a). The 
-plane is the plane that contains the - and -axes; the 
-plane con-
tains the - and -axes; the 
-plane contains the - and -axes. These three coordinate
planes divide space into eight parts, called octants. The ﬁrst octant, in the fore-
ground, is determined by the positive axes.
Because many people have some difﬁculty visualizing diagrams of three-dimen-
sional ﬁgures, you may ﬁnd it helpful to do the following [see Figure 3(b)]. Look at

In this chapter we introduce vectors and coordinate
systems for three-dimensional space. This is the setting
for the study of functions of two variables because the
graph of such a function is a surface in space. Vectors
provide particularly simple descriptions of lines and
planes in space as well as velocities and accelerations
of objects that move in space.

any bottom corner of a room and call the corner the origin. The wall on your left is in
the 
-plane, the wall on your right is in the 
-plane, and the ﬂoor is in the 
-plane.
The -axis runs along the intersection of the ﬂoor and the left wall. The -axis runs
along the intersection of the ﬂoor and the right wall. The -axis runs up from the ﬂoor
toward the ceiling along the intersection of the two walls. You are situated in the ﬁrst
octant, and you can now imagine seven other rooms situated in the other seven octants
(three on the same ﬂoor and four on the ﬂoor below), all connected by the common
corner point .
Now if 
is any point in space, let be the (directed) distance from the 
-plane to
, let 
be the distance from the 
-plane to , and let 
be the distance from the 
-plane to . We represent the point
by the ordered triple
of real numbers
and we call , , and the coordinates of ; 
is the -coordinate,
is the -coordi-
nate, and is the -coordinate. Thus, to locate the point 
we can start at the ori-
gin 
and move 
units along the -axis, then 
units parallel to the -axis, and then
units parallel to the -axis as in Figure 4.
The point 
determines a rectangular box as in Figure 5. If we drop a per-
pendicular from 
to the 
-plane, we get a point 
with coordinates 
called
the projection of 
on the 
-plane. Similarly,
and 
are the projec-
tions of 
on the 
-plane and 
-plane, respectively.
As numerical illustrations, the points 
and 
are plotted in
Figure 6.
The Cartesian product 
is the set of all or-
dered triples of real numbers and is denoted by 
. We have given a one-to-one cor-
respondence between points 
in space and ordered triples 
in 
. It is called
a three-dimensional rectangular coordinate system. Notice that, in terms of coor-
dinates, the ﬁrst octant can be described as the set of points whose coordinates are all
positive.
In two-dimensional analytic geometry, the graph of an equation involving and 
is a curve in 
. In three-dimensional analytic geometry, an equation in , , and rep-
resents a surface in 
.

(b) The equation 
represents the set of all points in 
whose -coordinate
is 5. This is the vertical plane that is parallel to the 
-plane and ﬁve units to the
right of it as in Figure 7(b).
NOTE
G When an equation is given, we must understand from the context whether it
represents a curve in
or a surface in
. In Example 1,
represents a plane in
, but of course 
can also represent a line in 
if we are dealing with two-
dimensional analytic geometry. See Figure 7(b) and (c).
In general, if is a constant, then 
represents a plane parallel to the
-plane,
is a plane parallel to the 
-plane, and 
is a plane parallel to the 
-plane.
In Figure 5, the faces of the rectangular box are formed by the three coordinate 
planes 
(the
-plane),
(the
-plane), and
(the
-plane), and the
planes
,
, and

EXAMPLE 2 Describe and sketch the surface in 
represented by the equation 
.
SOLUTION The equation represents the set of all points in 
whose - and -coordi-
nates are equal, that is,
. This is a vertical plane that inter-
sects the 
-plane in the line 
,
. The portion of this plane that lies in the
ﬁrst octant is sketched in Figure 8.
The familiar formula for the distance between two points in a plane is easily
extended to the following three-dimensional formula.
Distance Formula in Three Dimensions The distance 
between the points
and 
is
To see why this formula is true, we construct a rectangular box as in Figure 9,
where 
and 
are opposite vertices and the faces of the box are parallel to the coor-
dinate planes. If 
and 
are the vertices of the box indicated in
the ﬁgure, then

can be rewritten as
so they represent the points 
whose distance from the origin is at least 1 
and at most 2. But we are also given that 
, so the points lie on or below the 
xy-plane. Thus, the given inequalities represent the region that lies between (or on)
the spheres 
and 
and beneath (or on) the

The term vector is used by scientists to indicate a quantity (such as displacement or
velocity or force) that has both magnitude and direction. A vector is often represented
by an arrow or a directed line segment. The length of the arrow represents the magni-
tude of the vector and the arrow points in the direction of the vector. We denote a vec-
tor by printing a letter in boldface 
or by putting an arrow above the letter 
For instance, suppose a particle moves along a line segment from point 
to point
. The corresponding displacement vector , shown in Figure 1, has initial point
(the tail) and terminal point
(the tip) and we indicate this by writing 
AB
l.
Notice that the vector 
CD
l has the same length and the same direction as 
even
though it is in a different position. We say that 
and are equivalent (or equal) and
we write 
. The zero vector, denoted by 0, has length . It is the only vector with
no speciﬁc direction.
Combining Vectors
Suppose a particle moves from 
, so its displacement vector is AB
l. Then the par-
ticle changes direction and moves from 
, with displacement vector BC

In general, if we start with vectors and , we ﬁrst move so that its tail coincides
with the tip of 
and deﬁne the sum of 
and 
as follows.
Definition of Vector Addition If 
and 
are vectors positioned so the initial point
of 
is at the terminal point of , then the sum
is the vector from the
initial point of 
to the terminal point of .
The deﬁnition of vector addition is illustrated in Figure 3. You can see why this deﬁ-
nition is sometimes called the Triangle Law.
In Figure 4 we start with the same vectors 
and as in Figure 3 and draw another
copy of 
with the same initial point as . Completing the parallelogram, we see that
. This also gives another way to construct the sum: If we place 
and
so they start at the same point, then 
lies along the diagonal of the parallelo-
gram with 
and 
as sides.
EXAMPLE 1 Draw the sum of the vectors 
shown in Figure 5.
SOLUTION First we translate 
and place its tail at the tip of , being careful to draw a
copy of 
that has the same length and direction. Then we draw the vector 
[see Figure 6(a)] starting at the initial point of and ending at the terminal point of
the copy of .
Alternatively, we could place 
so it starts where starts and construct 
by
the Parallelogram Law as in Figure 6(b).
It is possible to multiply a vector by a real number . (In this context we call the
real number a scalar to distinguish it from a vector.) For instance, we want 
to be
the same vector as 
, which has the same direction as 
but is twice as long. In
general, we multiply a vector by a scalar as follows.
Definition of Scalar Multiplication If is a scalar and 
is a vector, then the scalar
multiple
is the vector whose length is 
times the length of 
and whose
direction is the same as 
if 
and is opposite to 
if 
. If

This deﬁnition is illustrated in Figure 7. We see that real numbers work like scal-
ing factors here; that’s why we call them scalars. Notice that two nonzero vectors 
are parallel if they are scalar multiples of one another. In particular, the vector
has the same length as 
but points in the opposite direction. We call it
the negative of .
By the difference
of two vectors we mean
So we can construct 
by ﬁrst drawing the negative of ,
, and then adding it
to
by the Parallelogram Law as in Figure 8(a). Alternatively, since
the vector 
, when added to , gives . So we could construct 
as in Fig-
ure 8(b) by means of the Triangle Law.
EXAMPLE 2 If 
are the vectors shown in Figure 9, draw 
.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst draw the vector 
pointing in the direction opposite to 
and
twice as long. We place it with its tail at the tip of 
and then use the Triangle Law
to draw 
as in Figure 10.
Components
For some purposes it’s best to introduce a coordinate system and treat vectors alge-
braically. If we place the initial point of a vector at the origin of a rectangular coor-
dinate system, then the terminal point of 
has coordinates of the form 
or
, depending on whether our coordinate system is two- or three-dimensional
(see Figure 11). These coordinates are called the components of 
and we write
or
We use the notation 
for the ordered pair that refers to a vector so as not to
confuse it with the ordered pair 
that refers to a point in the plane.
For instance, the vectors shown in Figure 12 are all equivalent to the vector
OP
l
whose terminal point is 
. What they have in common is that the
terminal point is reached from the initial point by a displacement of three units to the
right and two upward. We can think of all these geometric vectors as representations
of the algebraic vector 
. The particular representation OP
l from the origin
to the point 
is called the position vector of the point .

In three dimensions, the vector

is the position vector of the
point 
. (See Figure 13.) Let’s consider any other representation AB
l of

and the terminal point is 
. Then 
we must have 
,
, and 
and so 
,
, and

Given the points

with represen-
tation AB

EXAMPLE 3 Find the vector represented by the directed line segment with initial point

.
SOLUTION By (1), the vector corresponding to AB
l is
The magnitude or length of the vector is the length of any of its representations
and is denoted by the symbol 
or 
. By using the distance formula to compute
the length of a segment 
, we obtain the following formulas.
The length of the two-dimensional vector 
is
The length of the three-dimensional vector 
is
How do we add vectors algebraically? Figure 14 shows that if 
and
, then the sum is 
, at least for the case where
the components are positive. In other words, to add algebraic vectors we add their
components. Similarly, to subtract vectors we subtract components. From the similar
triangles in Figure 15 we see that the components of 
are 
and 
. So to multi-
ply a vector by a scalar we multiply each component by that scalar.

the set of all
three-dimensional vectors. More generally, we will later need to consider the set 
of
all -dimensional vectors. An -dimensional vector is an ordered -tuple:

L Vectors in 
dimensions are used to
list various quantities in an organized
way. For instance, the components of a
six-dimensional vector
might represent the prices of six different
ingredients required to make a particu-
lar product. Four-dimensional vectors
are used in relativity theory,
where the ﬁrst three components specify
a position in space and the fourth repre-
sents time.

We can see why Property 2 (the associative law) is true by looking at Figure 16 and
applying the Triangle Law several times: The vector PQ
l is obtained either by ﬁrst con-
structing a  b and then adding c or by adding a to the vector b  c.
Three vectors in 
play a special role. Let
Then , , and 
are vectors that have length and point in the directions of the posi-
tive -,
-, and -axes. Similarly, in two dimensions we deﬁne 
and
. (See Figure 17.)
If 
, then we can write
Thus, any vector in

and . For instance,
Similarly, in two dimensions, we can write
See Figure 18 for the geometric interpretation of Equations 3 and 2 and compare with

A unit vector is a vector whose length is 1. For instance, , , and 
are all unit
vectors. In general, if 
, then the unit vector that has the same direction as 
is
In order to verify this, we let 
. Then 
and is a positive scalar, so 
has the same direction as . Also
EXAMPLE 6 Find the unit vector in the direction of the vector 
.
SOLUTION The given vector has length
so, by Equation 4, the unit vector with the same direction is
Applications
Vectors are useful in many aspects of physics and engineering. In Chapter 10 we will
see how they describe the velocity and acceleration of objects moving in space. Here
we look at forces.
A force is represented by a vector because it has both a magnitude (measured in
pounds or newtons) and a direction. If several forces are acting on an object, the resul-
tant force experienced by the object is the vector sum of these forces.
EXAMPLE 7 A 100-lb weight hangs from two wires as shown in Figure 19. Find the
tensions (forces) 
and 
in both wires and their magnitudes.
SOLUTION We ﬁrst express 
and 
in terms of their horizontal and vertical compo-
nents. From Figure 20 we see that
The resultant 
of the tensions counterbalances the weight 
and so we must
have
Thus
Equating components, we get
Solving the ﬁrst of these equations for

CHAPTER 9 VECTORS AND THE GEOMETRY OF SPACE

So far we have added two vectors and multiplied a vector by a scalar. The question
arises: Is it possible to multiply two vectors so that their product is a useful quantity?
One such product is the dot product, which we consider in this section. Another is the
cross product, which is discussed in the next section.
Work and the Dot Product
An example of a situation in physics and engineering where we need to combine two
vectors occurs in calculating the work done by a force. In Section 6.5 we deﬁned the
work done by a constant force
in moving an object through a distance
as
,
but this applies only when the force is directed along the line of motion of the object.
Suppose, however, that the constant force is a vector 
PR
l pointing in some other
direction, as in Figure 1. If the force moves the object from 
to 
, then the dis-
placement vector is 
PQ
l. So here we have two vectors: the force 
and the dis-
placement . The work done by 
is deﬁned as the magnitude of the displacement,
, multiplied by the magnitude of the applied force in the direction of the motion,
which, from Figure 1, is
PS
l
F
So the work done by 
is deﬁned to be
Notice that work is a scalar quantity; it has no direction. But its value depends on the
angle between the force and displacement vectors.
We use the expression in Equation 1 to deﬁne the dot product of two vectors even
when they don’t represent force or displacement.
Definition The dot product of two nonzero vectors 
is the number
where 
is the angle between 
,
. (So 
is the smaller angle
between the vectors when they are drawn with the same initial point.) If either
is , we deﬁne

38. Suppose the three coordinate planes are all mirrored and a 
light ray given by the vector 
ﬁrst strikes
the 
-plane, as shown in the ﬁgure. Use the fact that 
the angle of incidence equals the angle of reﬂection to 
show that the direction of the reﬂected ray is given by
. Deduce that, after being reﬂected by 
all three mutually perpendicular mirrors, the resulting ray 
is parallel to the initial ray. (American space scientists 
used this principle, together with laser beams and an array
of corner mirrors on the Moon, to calculate very precisely
the distance from Earth to the Moon.)

This product is called the dot product because of the dot in the notation 
. The
result of computing 
is not a vector. It is a real number, that is, a scalar. For this
reason, the dot product is sometimes called the scalar product.
In the example of ﬁnding the work done by a force 
in moving an object through
a displacement 
PQ
l by calculating 
, it makes no sense for
the angle
between 
to be 
or larger because movement from 
couldn’t take place. We make no such restriction in our general deﬁnition of

however, and allow
to be any angle from

is positive if a and b point in the same general direction, 0 if they are perpendi-
cular, and negative if they point in generally opposite directions (see Figure 3). In the
extreme case where a and b point in exactly the same direction, we have

At the beginning of this section we saw one use of projections in physics––we used
a scalar projection of a force vector in deﬁning work. Other uses of projections occur
in three-dimensional geometry. In Exercise 33 you are asked to use a projection to ﬁnd
the distance from a point to a line, and in Section 9.5 we use a projection to ﬁnd the
distance from a point to a plane.

SECTION 9.4 THE CROSS PRODUCT
N
667
The cross product
of two vectors 
and , unlike the dot product, is a vector.
For this reason it is also called the vector product. We will see that 
is useful
in geometry because it is perpendicular to both 
and . But we introduce this prod-
uct by looking at a situation where it arises in physics and engineering.
Torque and the Cross Product
If we tighten a bolt by applying a force to a wrench as in Figure 1, we produce a turn-
ing effect called a torque . The magnitude of the torque depends on two things:
I
The distance from the axis of the bolt to the point where the force is
applied. This is 
, the length of the position vector .
I
The scalar component of the force 
in the direction perpendicular to .
This is the only component that can cause a rotation and, from Figure 2, we
see that it is 
where 
is the angle between the vectors 
.

We deﬁne the magnitude of the torque vector to be the product of these two factors:
The direction is along the axis of rotation. If 
is a unit vector that points in the direc-
tion in which a right-threaded bolt moves (see Figure 1), we deﬁne the torque to be
the vector
We denote this torque vector by 
and we call it the cross product or vector
product of 
.
The type of expression in Equation 1 occurs so frequently in the study of ﬂuid ﬂow,
planetary motion, and other areas of physics and engineering, that we deﬁne and study
the cross product of any pair of three-dimensional vectors 
.
Definition If 
are nonzero three-dimensional vectors, the cross product
of 
is the vector
where 
is the angle between 
,
, and 
is a unit vector per-
pendicular to both 
and whose direction is given by the right-hand
rule: If the ﬁngers of your right hand curl through the angle 
from 
,
then your thumb points in the direction of . (See Figure 3.)
If either 
is , then we deﬁne 
to be .
Because 
is a scalar multiple of , it has the same direction as 
and so
is orthogonal to both 
Notice that two nonzero vectors 
are parallel if and only if the angle be-
tween them is 
. In either case,
and so 
.
Two nonzero vectors 
are parallel if and only if 
.
This makes sense in the torque interpretation: If we pull or push the wrench in the
direction of its handle (so 
is parallel to ), we produce no torque.
EXAMPLE 1 A bolt is tightened by applying a 40-N force to a 0.25-m wrench as
shown in Figure 4. Find the magnitude of the torque about the center of the bolt.

EXAMPLE 2 Find

SOLUTION The standard basis vectors 
both have length 1 and the angle between
them is 
. By the right-hand rule, the unit vector perpendicular to and is 
(see Figure 5), so
But if we apply the right-hand rule to the vectors and (in that order), we see that
points downward and so 
. Thus
From Example 2 we see that
so the cross product is not commutative. Similar reasoning shows that
In general, the right-hand rule shows that
Another algebraic law that fails for the cross product is the associative law for mul-
tiplication; that is, in general,
For instance, if 
,
, and 
, then
whereas
However, some of the usual laws of algebra do hold for cross products:

three expressions. Properties 3 and 4 (the Vector Distributive Laws) are more difﬁcult
to establish; we won’t do so here.

Observe that each term on the right side of Equation 3 involves a number 
in the ﬁrst
row of the determinant, and 
is multiplied by the second-order determinant obtained
from the left side by deleting the row and column in which 
appears. Notice also the
minus sign in the second term. For example,
If we now rewrite (2) using second-order determinants and the standard basis 
vectors ,
, and , we see that the cross product of 
and
is
In view of the similarity between Equations 3 and 4, we often write
Although the ﬁrst row of the symbolic determinant in Equation 5 consists of vectors,
if we expand it as if it were an ordinary determinant using the rule in Equation 3, we
obtain Equation 4. The symbolic formula in Equation 5 is probably the easiest way of
remembering and computing cross products.

Its geometric signiﬁcance can be seen by considering the parallelepiped determined
by the vectors ,
, and . (See Figure 7.) The area of the base parallelogram is
. If 
is the angle between 
and 
, then the height 
of the paral-
lelepiped is 
. (We must use 
instead of 
in case 
.)
Thus, the volume of the parallelepiped is
Therefore, we have proved the following:
The volume of the parallelepiped determined by the vectors ,
, and is the
magnitude of their scalar triple product:
Instead of thinking of the parallelepiped as having its base parallelogram deter-
mined by 
and , we can think of it with base parallelogram determined by
and .
In this way, we see that

This shows that we can write the scalar triple product of , , and as the determinant
whose rows are the components of these vectors:
EXAMPLE 6 Use the scalar triple product to show that the vectors 
,

are coplanar; that is, they lie in the same
plane.
SOLUTION We use Equation 7 to compute their scalar triple product:
Therefore, the volume of the parallelepiped determined by ,

A line in the 
-plane is determined when a point on the line and the direction of the
line (its slope or angle of inclination) are given. The equation of the line can then be
written using the point-slope form.
Likewise, a line 
in three-dimensional space is determined when we know a point
on 
and the direction of . In three dimensions the direction of a line is
conveniently described by a vector, so we let be a vector parallel to . Let 
be an arbitrary point on 
and let 
and be the position vectors of 
and 
(that is,
they have representations OP0
A and OP
A). If 
is the vector with representation P0P
A,
as in Figure 1, then the Triangle Law for vector addition gives 
. But, since
and are parallel vectors, there is a scalar such that 
. Thus
which is a vector equation of . Each value of the parameter
gives the position
vector of a point on . In other words, as varies, the line is traced out by the tip of
the vector . As Figure 2 indicates, positive values of correspond to points on 
that
lie on one side of 
, whereas negative values of correspond to points that lie on the
other side of 
.
If the vector that gives the direction of the line 
is written in component form as
, then we have 
. We can also write 
and
, so the vector equation (1) becomes
Two vectors are equal if and only if corresponding components are equal. Therefore,
we have the three scalar equations:
where 
. These equations are called parametric equations of the line 
through
the point 
and parallel to the vector 
. Each value of the param-
eter gives a point 
on .

CHAPTER 9 VECTORS AND THE GEOMETRY OF SPACE

EXAMPLE 1
(a) Find a vector equation and parametric equations for the line that passes through
the point 
and is parallel to the vector 
.
(b) Find two other points on the line.
SOLUTION
(a) Here 
and 
, so the vector equa-
tion (1) becomes
or
Parametric equations are
(b) Choosing the parameter value 
gives 
,
, and 
so 
is a point on the line. Similarly,
gives the point 
.
The vector equation and parametric equations of a line are not unique. If we change
the point or the parameter or choose a different parallel vector, then the equations
change. For instance, if, instead of 
, we choose the point 
in Example 1,
then the parametric equations of the line become
Or, if we stay with the point 
but choose the parallel vector 
, we
arrive at the equations
In general, if a vector 
is used to describe the direction of a line , then
the numbers , , and are called direction numbers of . Since any vector parallel
to could also be used, we see that any three numbers proportional to , , and could
also be used as a set of direction numbers for .
Another way of describing a line is to eliminate the parameter from Equations 2.
If none of , , or is , we can solve each of these equations for equate the results,
and obtain
These equations are called symmetric equations of . Notice that the numbers , ,
and that appear in the denominators of Equations 3 are direction numbers of , that
is, components of a vector parallel to . If one of , , or is , we can still eliminate
For instance, if 
, we could write the equations of 
as
This means that 
lies in the vertical plane

EXAMPLE 2
(a) Find parametric equations and symmetric equations of the line that passes
through the points 
and 
.
(b) At what point does this line intersect the 
-plane?
SOLUTION
(a) We are not explicitly given a vector parallel to the line, but observe that the
vector 
with representation 
is parallel to the line and
Thus, direction numbers are 
,
, and 
. Taking the point 
as 
,we see that parametric equations (2) are
and symmetric equations (3) are
(b) The line intersects the 
-plane when 
, so we put 
in the symmetric
equations and obtain
This gives 
and 
, so the line intersects the 
-plane at the point 
.
In general, the procedure of Example 2 shows that direction numbers of the line
through the points 
and 
are 
,
, and 
and
so symmetric equations of 
are
EXAMPLE 3 Show that the lines 
and 
with parametric equations
are skew lines; that is, they do not intersect and are not parallel (and therefore do
not lie in the same plane).
SOLUTION The lines are not parallel because the corresponding vectors 
and
are not parallel. (Their components are not proportional.) If 
and 
had
a point of intersection, there would be values of and such that

But if we solve the ﬁrst two equations, we get

don’t satisfy the third equation. Therefore, there are no values of and that satisfy
the three equations. Thus,

lines.
Planes
Although a line in space is determined by a point and a direction, a plane in space is
more difﬁcult to describe. A single vector parallel to a plane is not enough to convey
the “direction” of the plane, but a vector perpendicular to the plane does completely
specify its direction. Thus, a plane in space is determined by a point 
in
the plane and a vector 
that is orthogonal to the plane. This orthogonal vector 
is
called a normal vector. Let 
be an arbitrary point in the plane, and let 
and 
be the position vectors of 
and . Then the vector 
is represented by P0P
A.
(See Figure 6.) The normal vector 
is orthogonal to every vector in the given plane.
In particular,
is orthogonal to 
and so we have
which can be rewritten as
Either Equation 4 or Equation 5 is called a vector equation of the plane.
To obtain a scalar equation for the plane, we write 
,
, and
. Then the vector equation (4) becomes
or
Equation 6 is the scalar equation of the plane through 
with normal 
vector 
.
EXAMPLE 4 Find an equation of the plane through the point 
with normal
vector 
. Find the intercepts and sketch the plane.
SOLUTION Putting 
,
,
,
,
, and 
in Equation 6,
we see that an equation of the plane is
or
To ﬁnd the -intercept we set 
in this equation and obtain 
. Simi-
larly, the -intercept is 4 and the -intercept is 3. This enables us to sketch the por-
tion of the plane that lies in the ﬁrst octant (see Figure 7).

By collecting terms in Equation 6 as we did in Example 4, we can rewrite the equa-
tion of a plane as
where
. Equation 7 is called a linear equation in , , and .
Conversely, it can be shown that if ,
, and 
are not all 0, then the linear equation
(7) represents a plane with normal vector 
. (See Exercise 53.)
EXAMPLE 5 Find an equation of the plane that passes through the points 
,
, and 
.
SOLUTION The vectors 
and 
corresponding to PQ
l and PR
l are
Since both and 
lie in the plane, their cross product 
is orthogonal to the
plane and can be taken as the normal vector. Thus
With the point 
and the normal vector , an equation of the plane is
or
EXAMPLE 6 Find the point at which the line with parametric equations 
,
,
intersects the plane 
.
SOLUTION We substitute the expressions for , , and from the parametric equations
into the equation of the plane:
This simpliﬁes to 
, so 
. Therefore, the point of intersection occurs
when the parameter value is 
. Then 
,
,
and so the point of intersection is 
Two planes are parallel if their normal vectors are parallel. For instance, the planes
and 
are parallel because their normal vectors
are 
and 
and 
. If two planes are not paral-
lel, then they intersect in a straight line and the angle between the two planes is de-
ﬁned as the acute angle between their normal vectors (see Figure 9).
EXAMPLE 7
(a) Find the angle between the planes 
and 
.
(b) Find symmetric equations for the line of intersection 
of these two planes.

and so, if 
is the angle between the planes,
(b) We ﬁrst need to ﬁnd a point on . For instance, we can ﬁnd the point where the
line intersects the 
-plane by setting 
in the equations of both planes. This
gives the equations 
and 
, whose solution is 
,
. So
the point 
lies on .
Now we observe that, since 
lies in both planes, it is perpendicular to both of
the normal vectors. Thus, a vector 
parallel to 
is given by the cross product
and so the symmetric equations of 
can be written as
NOTE
G Since a linear equation in ,
, and 
represents a plane and two non-
parallel planes intersect in a line, it follows that two linear equations can represent 
a line. The points 
that satisfy both 
and
lie on both of these planes, and so the pair of linear equa-
tions represents the line of intersection of the planes (if they are not parallel). For
instance, in Example 7 the line 
was given as the line of intersection of the planes
and 
. The symmetric equations that we found for 
could be written as
which is again a pair of linear equations. They exhibit 
as the line of intersection of
the planes 
and 
. (See Figure 11.)
In general, when we write the equations of a line in the symmetric form

EXAMPLE 8 Find a formula for the distance 
from a point 
to the 
plane 
.
SOLUTION Let 
be any point in the given plane and let 
be the vector 
corresponding to P0B
P1. Then
From Figure 12 you can see that the distance 
from 
to the plane is equal to the
absolute value of the scalar projection of 
onto the normal vector 
.
(See Section 9.3.) Thus
Since 
lies in the plane, its coordinates satisfy the equation of the plane and so we
have 
. Thus, the formula for 
can be written as
EXAMPLE 9 Find the distance between the parallel planes 
and 
.
SOLUTION First we note that the planes are parallel because their normal vectors
and 
are parallel. To ﬁnd the distance 
between the planes,
we choose any point on one plane and calculate its distance to the other plane. In
particular, if we put 
in the equation of the ﬁrst plane, we get 
and
so 
is a point in this plane. By Formula 8, the distance between 
and
the plane 
is
So the distance between the planes is 
.

are skew. Find the distance between them.

SOLUTION Since the two lines 
and 
are skew, they can be viewed as lying on two
parallel planes 
and 
. The distance between 
and 
is the same as the dis-
tance between 
and 
, which can be computed as in Example 9. The common
normal vector to both planes must be orthogonal to both 
(the direc-
tion of 
) and 
(the direction of 
). So a normal vector is
If we put 
in the equations of 
, we get the point 
on 
and so an
equation for 
is
If we now set 
in the equations for 
, we get the point 
on 
. So 
the distance between 
and 
is the same as the distance from 
to
. By Formula 8, this distance is

In this section we take a ﬁrst look at functions of two variables and their graphs, which
are surfaces in three-dimensional space. We will give a much more thorough treatment
of such functions in Chapter 11.
Functions of Two Variables
The temperature 
at a point on the surface of the earth at any given time depends on
the longitude 
and latitude 
of the point. We can think of 
as being a function of
the two variables and , or as a function of the pair 
. We indicate this functional
dependence by writing 
.
The volume 
of a circular cylinder depends on its radius 
and its height . In 
fact, we know that
. We say that
is a function of
and
, and we write
.
Definition A function
of two variables is a rule that assigns to each ordered
pair of real numbers 
in a set 
a unique real number denoted by 
.
The set 
is the domain of 
and its range is the set of values that 
takes on,
that is,
.
We often write 
to make explicit the value taken on by 
at the general
point 
. The variables and are independent variables and is the dependent
variable. [Compare this with the notation 
for functions of a single variable.]
The domain is a subset of 
, the 
-plane. We can think of the domain as the set
of all possible inputs and the range as the set of all possible outputs. If a function 
is
given by a formula and no domain is speciﬁed, then the domain of 
is understood 
to be the set of all pairs 
for which the given expression is a well-deﬁned real
number.

EXAMPLE 1 If 
, then 
is deﬁned for all possible ordered
pairs of real numbers 
, so the domain is 
, the entire 
-plane. The range of 
is the set 
of all nonnegative real numbers. [Notice that 
and 
, so
for all and .]
EXAMPLE 2 Find the domains of the following functions and evaluate 
.
(a)
(b)
SOLUTION
(a)
The expression for 
makes sense if the denominator is not 0 and the quantity under
the square root sign is nonnegative. So the domain of 
is
The inequality 
, or 
, describes the points that lie on or
above the line 
, while 
means that the points on the line 
must be excluded from the domain. (See Figure 1.)
(b)
Since 
is deﬁned only when 
, that is,
, the domain of 
is 
. This is the set of points to the left of the parabola 
.
(See Figure 2.)
Not all functions can be represented by explicit formulas. The function in the next
example is described verbally and by numerical estimates of its values.
EXAMPLE 3 The wave heights 
(in feet) in the open sea depend mainly on the speed
of the wind (in knots) and the length of time (in hours) that the wind has been
blowing at that speed. So 
is a function of and and we can write 
.
Observations and measurements have been made by meteorologists and oceanogra-
phers and are recorded in Table 1.

For instance, the table indicates that if the wind has been blowing at 50 knots for
30 hours, then the wave heights are estimated to be 45 ft, so 
The domain of this function 
is given by 
and 
. Although there is no
exact formula for 
in terms of and , we will see that the operations of calculus
can still be carried out for such an experimentally deﬁned function.
Graphs
One way of visualizing the behavior of a function of two variables is to consider its
graph.
Definition If
is a function of two variables with domain D, then the graph of
is the set of all points 
in 
such that 
and 
is in D.
Just as the graph of a function 
of one variable is a curve 
with equation
so the graph of a function 
of two variables is a surface 
with equation
. We can visualize the graph 
of 
as lying directly above or below its
domain 
in the 
-plane (see Figure 3).
EXAMPLE 4 Sketch the graph of the function 
.
SOLUTION The graph of 
has the equation 
, or 
,
which represents a plane. By ﬁnding the intercepts (as in Example 4 in Section 9.5),
we sketch the portion of this graph that lies in the ﬁrst octant in Figure 4.
The function in Example 4 is a special case of the function
which is called a linear function. The graph of such a function has the equation
, or 
, so it is a plane. In much the same way
that linear functions of one variable are important in single-variable calculus, we will
see that linear functions of two variables play a central role in multivariable calculus.
EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the graph of the function 
.
SOLUTION Notice that, no matter what value we give , the value of 
is always
. The equation of the graph is 
, which doesn’t involve y. This means that
any vertical plane with equation 
(parallel to the 
-plane) intersects the graph
in a curve with equation 
, that is, a parabola. Figure 5 shows how the graph is
formed by taking the parabola 
in the 
-plane and moving it in the direction
of the y-axis. So the graph is a surface, called a parabolic cylinder, made up of
inﬁnitely many shifted copies of the same parabola.
In sketching the graphs of functions of two variables, it’s often useful to start by
determining the shapes of cross-sections (slices) of the graph. For example, if we keep
ﬁxed by putting 
(a constant) and letting vary, the result is a function of one

variable 
, whose graph is the curve that results when we intersect the sur-
face 
with the vertical plane 
. In a similar fashion we can slice the 
surface with the vertical plane 
and look at the curves 
. We can also
slice with horizontal planes 
. All three types of curves are called traces (or cross-
sections) of the surface 
.
EXAMPLE 6 Use traces to sketch the graph of the function 
.
SOLUTION The equation of the graph is 
. If we put 
, we get 
,
so the 
-plane intersects the surface in a parabola. If we put 
(a constant), we
get 
. This means that if we slice the graph with any plane parallel to
the 
-plane, we obtain a parabola that opens upward. Similarly, if 
, the trace
is 
, which is again a parabola that opens upward. If we put 
, we
get the horizontal traces 
, which we recognize as a family of ellipses.
Knowing the shapes of the traces, we can sketch the graph of 
in Figure 6. Because
of the elliptical and parabolic traces, the surface 
is called an elliptic
paraboloid.
EXAMPLE 7 Sketch the graph of 
.
SOLUTION The traces in the vertical planes 
are the parabolas 
,
which open upward. The traces in 
are the parabolas 
, which
open downward. The horizontal traces are 
, a family of hyperbolas. We
draw the families of traces in Figure 7 and we show how the traces appear when
placed in their correct planes in Figure 8.
In Figure 9 we ﬁt together the traces from Figure 8 together to form the surface
, a hyperbolic paraboloid. Notice that the shape of the surface near the

origin resembles that of a saddle. This surface will be investigated further in Sec-
tion 11.7 when we discuss saddle points.
The idea of using traces to draw a surface is employed in three-dimensional graph-
ing software for computers. In most such software, traces in the vertical planes 
and 
are drawn for equally spaced values of and parts of the graph are elimi-
nated using hidden line removal. Figure 10 shows computer-generated graphs of sev-
eral functions. Notice that we get an especially good picture of a function when rota-
tion is used to give views from different vantage points. In parts (a) and (b) the graph
of is very ﬂat and close to the

is very small when or is large.

Quadric Surfaces
The graph of a second-degree equation in three variables ,
, and 
is called a
quadric surface. We have already sketched the quadric surfaces 
(an
elliptic paraboloid) and 
(a hyperbolic paraboloid) in Figures 6 and 9. In
the next example we investigate a quadric surface called an ellipsoid.
EXAMPLE 8 Sketch the quadric surface with equation
SOLUTION The trace in the xy-plane 
is 
, which we recognize as
an equation of an ellipse. In general, the horizontal trace in the plane 
is
which is an ellipse, provided that 
, that is,
.
Similarly, the vertical traces are also ellipses:
Figure 11 shows how drawing some traces indicates the shape of the surface. It’s
called an ellipsoid because all of its traces are ellipses. Notice that it is symmetric
with respect to each coordinate plane; this is a reﬂection of the fact that its equation
involves only even powers of x, y, and .
The ellipsoid in Example 8 is not the graph of a function because some vertical
lines (such as the -axis) intersect it more than once. But the top and bottom halves
are graphs of functions. In fact, if we solve the equation of the ellipsoid for , we get 
So the graphs of the functions
and
are the top and bottom halves of the ellipsoid (see Figure 12). The domain of both 
and is the set of all points 
such that
so the domain is the set of all points that lie on or inside the ellipse

EXAMPLE 9 Classify the quadric surface 
.
SOLUTION By completing the square we rewrite the equation as
Comparing this equation with Table 2, we see that it represents an elliptic parabo-
loid. Here, however, the axis of the paraboloid is parallel to the -axis, and it has
been shifted so that its vertex is the point 
. The traces in the plane 
are the ellipses
The trace in the 
-plane is the parabola with equation 
,
.
The paraboloid is sketched in Figure 13.

what is called a ruled surface; that is, it can be generated
by the motion of a straight line. In fact, this exercise shows
that through each point on the hyperbolic paraboloid there
are two generating lines. The only other quadric surfaces
that are ruled surfaces are cylinders, cones, and hyperbo-
loids of one sheet.)

In plane geometry the polar coordinate system is used to give a convenient description
of certain curves and regions. (See Appendix H.) In three dimensions there are two
coordinate systems that are similar to polar coordinates and give convenient descrip-
tions of some commonly occurring surfaces and solids. They will be especially useful
in Chapter 12 when we compute volumes and triple integrals.
Cylindrical Coordinates
In the cylindrical coordinate system, a point 
in three-dimensional space is repre-
sented by the ordered triple 
, where and 
are polar coordinates of the pro-
jection of onto the 
-plane and is the directed distance from the 
-plane to (see
Figure 1).
To convert from cylindrical to rectangular coordinates we use the equations
whereas to convert from rectangular to cylindrical coordinates we use
These equations follow from Equations 1 and 2 in Appendix H.1.
EXAMPLE 1
(a) Plot the point with cylindrical coordinates 
and ﬁnd its rectangular 
coordinates.
(b) Find cylindrical coordinates of the point with rectangular coordinates
.
SOLUTION
(a) The point with cylindrical coordinates 
is plotted in Figure 2. From
Equations 1, its rectangular coordinates are
Thus, the point is 
in rectangular coordinates.

(b) From Equations 2 we have
so
Therefore, one set of cylindrical coordinates is 
. Another is
. As with polar coordinates, there are inﬁnitely many choices.
Cylindrical coordinates are useful in problems that involve symmetry about an
axis, and the -axis is chosen to coincide with this axis of symmetry. For instance, the
axis of the circular cylinder with Cartesian equation 
is the -axis. In
cylindrical coordinates this cylinder has the very simple equation 
. (See Figure 3.)
This is the reason for the name “cylindrical” coordinates.
EXAMPLE 2 Describe the surface whose equation in cylindrical coordinates is 
.
SOLUTION The equation says that the -value, or height, of each point on the surface is
the same as r, the distance from the point to the -axis. Because 
doesn’t appear, it
can vary. So any horizontal trace in the plane 
is a circle of radius k.
These traces suggest that the surface is a cone. This prediction can be conﬁrmed by
converting the equation to rectangular coordinates. From the ﬁrst equation in (2) we
have
We recognize the equation 
(by comparison with Table 2 in Section 9.6)
as being a circular cone whose axis is the -axis (see Figure 4).
EXAMPLE 3 Find an equation in cylindrical coordinates for the ellipsoid
.
SOLUTION Since 
from Equations 2, we have
So an equation of the ellipsoid in cylindrical coordinates is 
.

Spherical Coordinates
The spherical coordinates
of a point 
in space are shown in Figure 5,
where 
is the distance from the origin to ,
is the same angle as in cylin-
drical coordinates, and 
is the angle between the positive -axis and the line segment
. Note that
The spherical coordinate system is especially useful in problems where there is sym-
metry about a point, and the origin is placed at this point. For example, the sphere with
center the origin and radius has the simple equation 
(see Figure 6); this is the
reason for the name “spherical” coordinates. The graph of the equation 
is a ver-
tical half-plane (see Figure 7), and the equation 
represents a half-cone with the
-axis as its axis (see Figure 8).
The relationship between rectangular and spherical coordinates can be seen from
Figure 9. From triangles 
and 
we have
But 
and 
, so to convert from spherical to rectangular coordi-
nates, we use the equations
Also, the distance formula shows that
We use this equation in converting from rectangular to spherical coordinates.

EXAMPLE 8 Use a computer to draw a picture of the solid that remains when a hole
of radius 3 is drilled through the center of a sphere of radius 4.
SOLUTION To keep the equations simple, let’s choose the coordinate system so that the
center of the sphere is at the origin and the axis of the cylinder that forms the hole is
the -axis. We could use either cylindrical or spherical coordinates to describe the
solid, but the description is somewhat simpler if we use cylindrical coordinates.
Then the equation of the cylinder is 
and the equation of the sphere is
, or 
. The points in the solid lie outside the cylinder
and inside the sphere, so they satisfy the inequalities
To ensure that the computer graphs only the appropriate parts of these surfaces, we
ﬁnd where they intersect by solving the equations 
and 
:
The solid lies between 
and 
, so we ask the computer to graph the
surfaces with the following equations and domains:
The resulting picture, shown in Figure 11, is exactly what we want.

; Families of Surfaces
In this project you will discover the interesting shapes that members of families of surfaces
can take. You will also see how the shape of the surface evolves as you vary the constants.
1. Use a computer to investigate the family of functions
How does the shape of the graph depend on the numbers 
and ?
2. Use a computer to investigate the family of surfaces 
. In particular,
you should determine the transitional values of for which the surface changes from
one type of quadric surface to another.
3. Members of the family of surfaces given in spherical coordinates by the equation
have been suggested as models for tumors and have been called bumpy spheres and
wrinkled spheres. Use a computer to investigate this family of surfaces, assuming that 
and 
are positive integers. What roles do the values of 
and 
play in the shape of the
surface?

1. Each edge of a cubical box has length 1 m. The box contains nine spherical balls with
the same radius . The center of one ball is at the center of the cube and it touches the
other eight balls. Each of the other eight balls touches three sides of the box. Thus, the
balls are tightly packed in the box. (See the ﬁgure.) Find . (If you have trouble with

4. A plane is capable of ﬂying at a speed of 180 kmh in still air. The pilot takes off from
an airﬁeld and heads due north according to the plane’s compass. After 30 minutes of

at an angle 5° east of north.
(a) What is the wind velocity?
(b) In what direction should the pilot have headed to reach the intended destination?
5. Suppose a block of mass 
is placed on an inclined plane, as shown in the ﬁgure. The
block’s descent down the plane is slowed by friction; if 
is not too large, friction will
prevent the block from moving at all. The forces acting on the block are the weight 
,
where 
( is the acceleration due to gravity); the normal force 
(the normal
component of the reactionary force of the plane on the block), where 
; and the
force F due to friction, which acts parallel to the inclined plane, opposing the direction
of motion. If the block is at rest and 
is increased,
must also increase until ulti-
mately 
reaches its maximum, beyond which the block begins to slide. At this angle
, it has been observed that

In general, a function is a rule that assigns to each element in the domain an element
in the range. A vector-valued function, or vector function, is simply a function whose
domain is a set of real numbers and whose range is a set of vectors. We are most inter-
ested in vector functions 
whose values are three-dimensional vectors. This means
that for every number in the domain of 
there is a unique vector in 
denoted by
. If 
,
, and 
are the components of the vector 
, then , , and 
are
real-valued functions called the component functions of and we can write
We use the letter 
to denote the independent variable because it represents time in
most applications of vector functions.
EXAMPLE 1 If
then the component functions are
By our usual convention, the domain of consists of all values of for which the
expression for 
is deﬁned. The expressions ,
, and 
are all deﬁned
when 
and 
. Therefore, the domain of is the interval 
.
The limit of a vector function 
is deﬁned by taking the limits of its component
functions as follows.
If 
, then
provided the limits of the component functions exist.

The functions that we have been using so far have
been real-valued functions. We now study functions
whose values are vectors because such functions are
needed to describe curves and surfaces in space. 
We will also use vector-valued functions to describe 
the motion of objects through space. In particular, 
we will use them to derive Kepler’s laws of planetary
motion.
L If 
, this deﬁnition is
equivalent to saying that the length and
direction of the vector 
approach the
length and direction of the vector .

Limits of vector functions obey the same rules as limits of real-valued functions
(see Exercise 33).
EXAMPLE 2 Find 
, where 
.
SOLUTION According to Deﬁnition 1, the limit of r is the vector whose components
are the limits of the component functions of r:
(by Equation 3.4.2)
A vector function is continuous at a if
In view of Deﬁnition 1, we see that is continuous at 
if and only if its component
functions , , and 
are continuous at .
There is a close connection between continuous vector functions and space curves.
Suppose that , , and 
are continuous real-valued functions on an interval . Then
the set 
of all points 
in space, where
and varies throughout the interval , is called a space curve. The equations in (2) are
called parametric equations of C and is called a parameter. We can think of 
as
being traced out by a moving particle whose position at time is 
. If
we now consider the vector function 
, then 
is the position
vector of the point 
on 
. Thus, any continuous vector function 
deﬁnes a space curve 
that is traced out by the tip of the moving vector 
, as shown
in Figure 1.
EXAMPLE 3 Describe the curve deﬁned by the vector function
SOLUTION The corresponding parametric equations are
which we recognize from Equations 9.5.2 as parametric equations of a line pass-
ing through the point 
and parallel to the vector 
. Alternatively,
we could observe that the function can be written as 
, where
and 
, and this is the vector equation of a line as given
by Equation 9.5.1.
Plane curves can also be represented in vector notation. For instance, the curve
given by the parametric equations 
and 
(see Example 1 in Sec-
tion 1.7) could also be described by the vector equation
where 
and

EXAMPLE 4 Sketch the curve whose vector equation is
SOLUTION The parametric equations for this curve are
Since 
, the curve must lie on the circular cylinder
. The point 
lies directly above the point 
, which moves 
counterclockwise around the circle 
in the xy-plane. (See Example 2 
in Section 1.7.) Since 
, the curve spirals upward around the cylinder as 
increases. The curve, shown in Figure 2, is called a helix.
The corkscrew shape of the helix in Example 4 is familiar from its occurrence in
coiled springs. It also occurs in the model of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid, the genetic
material of living cells). In 1953 James Watson and Francis Crick showed that the
structure of the DNA molecule is that of two linked, parallel helices that are inter-
twined as in Figure 3.
EXAMPLE 5 Find a vector function that represents the curve of intersection of the
cylinder 
and the plane 
.
SOLUTION Figure 4 shows how the plane and the cylinder intersect, and Figure 5
shows the curve of intersection C, which is an ellipse.
The projection of C onto the xy-plane is the circle 
. So we
know from Example 2 in Section 1.7 that we can write
From the equation of the plane, we have
So we can write parametric equations for C as

This equation is called a parametrization of the curve C. The arrows in Figure 5
indicate the direction in which C is traced as the parameter t increases.
Using Computers to Draw Space Curves
Space curves are inherently more difﬁcult to draw by hand than plane curves; for an
accurate representation we need to use technology. For instance, Figure 6 shows a
computer-generated graph of the curve with parametric equations
It’s called a toroidal spiral because it lies on a torus. Another interesting curve, the
trefoil knot, with equations
is graphed in Figure 7. It wouldn’t be easy to plot either of these curves by hand.
Even when a computer is used to draw a space curve, optical illusions make it dif-
ﬁcult to get a good impression of what the curve really looks like. (This is especially
true in Figure 7. See Exercise 34.) The next example shows how to cope with this
problem.
EXAMPLE 6 Use a computer to sketch the curve with vector equation 
This curve is called a twisted cubic.
SOLUTION We start by using the computer to plot the curve with parametric equations
,
,
for 
. The result is shown in Figure 8(a), but it’s
hard to see the true nature of the curve from that graph alone. Most three-dimen-
sional computer graphing programs allow the user to enclose a curve or surface in a
box instead of displaying the coordinate axes. When we look at the same curve in a
box in Figure 8(b), we have a much clearer picture of the curve. We can see that it
climbs from a lower corner of the box to the upper corner nearest us, and it twists as
it climbs.

CHAPTER 10 VECTOR FUNCTIONS

We get an even better idea of the curve when we view it from different vantage
points. Part (c) shows the result of rotating the box to give another viewpoint. Parts
(d), (e), and (f) show the views we get when we look directly at a face of the box. In
particular, part (d) shows the view from directly above the box. It is the projection
of the curve on the 
-plane, namely, the parabola 
. Part (e) shows the projec-
tion on the 
-plane, the cubic curve 
. It’s now obvious why the given curve is
called a twisted cubic.
Another method of visualizing a space curve is to draw it on a surface. For
instance, the twisted cubic in Example 6 lies on the parabolic cylinder 
.
(Eliminate the parameter from the ﬁrst two parametric equations,
and 
.)
Figure 9 shows both the cylinder and the twisted cubic, and we see that the curve
moves upward from the origin along the surface of the cylinder. We also used this
method in Example 4 to visualize the helix lying on the circular cylinder (see Figure 2).
A third method for visualizing the twisted cubic is to realize that it also lies on the
cylinder 
. So it can be viewed as the curve of intersection of the cylinders
and 
. (See Figure 10.)

Later in this chapter we are going to use vector functions to describe the motion of
planets and other objects through space. Here we prepare the way by developing the
calculus of vector functions.
Derivatives
The derivative 
of a vector function is deﬁned in much the same way as for real-
valued functions:
if this limit exists. The geometric signiﬁcance of this deﬁnition is shown in Figure 1.

34. The view of the trefoil knot shown in Figure 7 is accurate,
but it doesn’t reveal the whole story. Use the parametric
equations
to sketch the curve by hand as viewed from above, with
gaps indicating where the curve passes over itself. Start by
showing that the projection of the curve onto the 
-plane
has polar coordinates 
and 
, so 
varies between 1 and 3. Then show that has maximum and
minimum values when the projection is halfway between
and 
.
;
When you have ﬁnished your sketch, use a computer to
draw the curve with viewpoint directly above and compare
with your sketch. Then use the computer to draw the curve
from several other viewpoints. You can get a better impres-
sion of the curve if you plot a tube with radius 0.2 around
the curve. (Use the tubeplot command in Maple.)

EXAMPLE 3 Find parametric equations for the tangent line to the helix with para-
metric equations
at the point

SOLUTION The vector equation of the helix is 
, so
The parameter value corresponding to the point 
is 
, so the tan-
gent vector there is

parallel to the vector 
, so by Equations 9.5.2 its parametric
equations are

derivative of , that is,
. For instance, the second derivative of the function
in Example 3 is
A curve given by a vector function 
on an interval 
is called smooth if 
is
continuous and 
(except possibly at any endpoints of ). For instance, the
helix in Example 3 is smooth because 
is never 0.
EXAMPLE 4 Determine whether the semicubical parabola 
is
smooth.
SOLUTION Since
we have 
and, therefore, the curve is not smooth. The point that
corresponds to 
is (1, 0), and we see from the graph in Figure 4 that there is a
sharp corner, called a cusp, at (1, 0). Any curve with this type of behavior—an
abrupt change in direction—is not smooth.

for all
SOLUTION Since
and 
is a constant, Formula 4 of Theorem 3 gives
Thus,
, which says that 
is orthogonal to 
.
Geometrically, this result says that if a curve lies on a sphere with center the ori-
gin, then the tangent vector 
is always perpendicular to the position vector 
Integrals
The deﬁnite integral of a continuous vector function 
can be deﬁned in much the
same way as for real-valued functions except that the integral is a vector. But then we
can express the integral of in terms of the integrals of its component functions , ,
and 
as follows. (We use the notation of Chapter 5.)
and so
This means that we can evaluate an integral of a vector function by integrating each
component function.
We can extend the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to continuous vector func-
tions as follows:
where 
is an antiderivative of , that is,
. We use the notation 
for
indeﬁnite integrals (antiderivatives).

In Section 6.3 we deﬁned the length of a plane curve with parametric equations

where

are continuous, we arrived at the formula
The length of a space curve is deﬁned in exactly the same way (see Figure 1). Sup-
pose that the curve has the vector equation

, or,
equivalently, the parametric equations

, and

it can be shown that its length is

EXAMPLE 1 Find the length of the arc of the circular helix with vector equation
from the point 
to the point 
.
SOLUTION Since 
, we have
The arc from 
to 
is described by the parameter interval
and so, from Formula 3, we have
A single curve 
can be represented by more than one vector function. For in-
stance, the twisted cubic
could also be represented by the function
where the connection between the parameters and is given by 
. We say that
Equations 4 and 5 are parametrizations of the curve . (The same curve 
is traced
out in different ways by the parametrizations 
and .) If we were to use Equation 3
to compute the length of 
using Equations 4 and 5, we would get the same answer.
In general, it can be shown that when Equation 3 is used to compute the length of any
piecewise-smooth curve, the arc length is independent of the parametrization that is
used.
Now we suppose that 
is a piecewise-smooth curve given by a vector function
,
, and 
is traversed exactly once as increases
from 
to . We deﬁne its arc length function
by
Thus,
is the length of the part of 
between 
and 
. (See Figure 3.) If we
differentiate both sides of Equation 6 using Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem of Cal-
culus, we obtain
It is often useful to parametrize a curve with respect to arc length because arc
length arises naturally from the shape of the curve and does not depend on a particu-
lar coordinate system. If a curve 
is already given in terms of a parameter and 
is the arc length function given by Equation 6, then we may be able to solve for

EXAMPLE 2 Reparametrize the helix

SOLUTION The initial point 
corresponds to the parameter value

Example 1 we have

Therefore,

Curvature
If 
is a smooth curve deﬁned by the vector function , then 
. Recall that the
unit tangent vector 
is given by
and indicates the direction of the curve. From Figure 4 you can see that 
changes
direction very slowly when 
is fairly straight, but it changes direction more quickly
when 
bends or twists more sharply.
The curvature of 
at a given point is a measure of how quickly the curve changes
direction at that point. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne it to be the magnitude of the rate of
change of the unit tangent vector with respect to arc length. (We use arc length so that
the curvature will be independent of the parametrization.)
Definition The curvature of a curve is
where 
is the unit tangent vector.
The curvature is easier to compute if it is expressed in terms of the parameter 
instead of , so we use the Chain Rule (Theorem 10.2.3, Formula 6) to write

EXAMPLE 3 Show that the curvature of a circle of radius 
is 
.
SOLUTION We can take the circle to have center the origin, and then a parametrization
is
Therefore
so
and
This gives 
, so using Equation 9, we have
The result of Example 3 shows that small circles have large curvature and large cir-
cles have small curvature, in accordance with our intuition. We can see directly from
the deﬁnition of curvature that the curvature of a straight line is always 0 because the
tangent vector is constant.
Although Formula 9 can be used in all cases to compute the curvature, the formula
given by the following theorem is often more convenient to apply.
Theorem The curvature of the curve given by the vector function is
Proof Since 
and 
, we have
so the Product Rule (Theorem 10.2.3, Formula 3) gives
Using the fact that

The Normal and Binormal Vectors
At a given point on a smooth space curve 
, there are many vectors that are orthog-
onal to the unit tangent vector 
. We single one out by observing that, because
for all , we have 
by Example 5 in Section 10.2, so 
is orthogonal to 
. Note that 
is itself not a unit vector. But if 
is also smooth,
we can deﬁne the principal unit normal vector
(or simply unit normal) as
The vector 
is called the binormal vector. It is perpendicular to
both 
and 
and is also a unit vector. (See Figure 6.)
EXAMPLE 6 Find the unit normal and binormal vectors for the circular helix
SOLUTION We ﬁrst compute the ingredients needed for the unit normal vector:
This shows that the normal vector at a point on the helix is horizontal and points
toward the -axis. The binormal vector is
The plane determined by the normal and binormal vectors 
and 
at a point 
on
a curve 
is called the normal plane of 
at . It consists of all lines that are orthog-
onal to the tangent vector . The plane determined by the vectors 
and 
is called
the osculating plane of 
at . The name comes from the Latin osculum, meaning
“kiss.” It is the plane that comes closest to containing the part of the curve near . (For
a plane curve, the osculating plane is simply the plane that contains the curve.)
The circle that lies in the osculating plane of 
at , has the same tangent as 
at
, lies on the concave side of 
(toward which 
points), and has radius 
(the
reciprocal of the curvature) is called the osculating circle (or the circle of curvature)
of 
at . It is the circle that best describes how 
behaves near ; it shares the same
tangent, normal, and curvature at .

equation is therefore
For the graph in Figure 9 we use parametric equations of this circle:

In this section we show how the ideas of tangent and normal vectors and curvature can
be used in physics to study the motion of an object, including its velocity and accel-
eration, along a space curve. In particular, we follow in the footsteps of Newton by
using these methods to derive Kepler’s First Law of planetary motion.
Suppose a particle moves through space so that its position vector at time is 
.
Notice from Figure 1 that, for small values of , the vector
approximates the direction of the particle moving along the curve 
. Its magnitude
measures the size of the displacement vector per unit time. The vector (1) gives the
average velocity over a time interval of length and its limit is the velocity vector
at time :t

Thus, the velocity vector is also the tangent vector and points in the direction of the
tangent line.
The speed of the particle at time
is the magnitude of the velocity vector, that is,
This is appropriate because, from (2) and from Equation 10.3.7, we have
As in the case of one-dimensional motion, the acceleration of the particle is deﬁned
as the derivative of the velocity:
EXAMPLE 1 The position vector of an object moving in a plane is given by
,

and 
illustrate geometrically.
SOLUTION The velocity and acceleration at time are
and the speed is
When

These velocity and acceleration vectors are shown in Figure 2.
EXAMPLE 2 Find the velocity, acceleration, and speed of a particle with position

SOLUTION
The vector integrals that were introduced in Section 10.2 can be used to ﬁnd posi-

If the force that acts on a particle is known, then the acceleration can be found from
Newton’s Second Law of Motion. The vector version of this law states that if, at any
time , a force 
acts on an object of mass 
producing an acceleration 
, then
EXAMPLE 4 An object with mass 
that moves in a circular path with constant angu-
lar speed 
has position vector 
. Find the force acting
on the object and show that it is directed toward the origin.
SOLUTION
Therefore, Newton’s Second Law gives the force as
Notice that 
. This shows that the force acts in the direction opposite
to the radius vector 
and therefore points toward the origin (see Figure 5). Such a
force is called a centripetal (center-seeking) force.
EXAMPLE 5 A projectile is ﬁred with angle of elevation 
and initial velocity 
. (See
Figure 6.) Assuming that air resistance is negligible and the only external force is
due to gravity, ﬁnd the position function 
of the projectile. What value of 
maxi-
mizes the range (the horizontal distance traveled)?
SOLUTION We set up the axes so that the projectile starts at the origin. Since the force
due to gravity acts downward, we have
where 
m	s . Thus
Since 
, we have
where 
. Therefore
Integrating again, we obtain
But 
, so the position vector of the projectile is given by

Tangential and Normal Components of Acceleration
When we study the motion of a particle, it is often useful to resolve the acceleration
into two components, one in the direction of the tangent and the other in the direction
of the normal. If we write 
for the speed of the particle, then
and so
If we differentiate both sides of this equation with respect to , we get
If we use the expression for the curvature given by Equation 10.3.9, then we have
The unit normal vector was deﬁned in the preceding section as 
, so (6)
gives
and Equation 5 becomes
Writing 
and

Let’s look at what Formula 7 says. The ﬁrst thing to notice is that the binormal vec-
tor B is absent. No matter how an object moves through space, its acceleration always
lies in the plane of T and N (the osculating plane). (Recall that T gives the direction
of motion and N points in the direction the curve is turning.) Next we notice that the
tangential component of acceleration is , the rate of change of speed, and the normal
component of acceleration is 
, the curvature times the square of the speed. This
makes sense if we think of a passenger in a car—a sharp turn in a road means a large
value of the curvature , so the component of the acceleration perpendicular to the
motion is large and the passenger is thrown against a car door. High speed around the
turn has the same effect; in fact, if you double your speed,
is increased by a factor
of 4.
Although we have expressions for the tangential and normal components of accel-
eration in Equations 8, it is desirable to have expressions that depend only on ,
, and
. To this end we take the dot product of 
with 
as given by Equation 7:
(since 
and 
)
Therefore
Using the formula for curvature given by Theorem 10.3.10, we have
EXAMPLE 6 A particle moves with position function 
. Find the tan-
gential and normal components of acceleration.
SOLUTION
Therefore, Equation 9 gives the tangential component as
Since
Equation 10 gives the normal component as

CHAPTER 10 VECTOR FUNCTIONS

Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion
We now describe one of the great accomplishments of calculus by showing how the
material of this chapter can be used to prove Kepler’s laws of planetary motion. After
20 years of studying the astronomical observations of the Danish astronomer Tycho
Brahe, the German mathematician and astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) for-
mulated the following three laws.
Kepler’s Laws
1. A planet revolves around the Sun in an elliptical orbit with the Sun at one
focus.
2. The line joining the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
3. The square of the period of revolution of a planet is proportional to the
cube of the length of the major axis of its orbit.
In his book Principia Mathematica of 1687, Sir Isaac Newton was able to show
that these three laws are consequences of two of his own laws, the Second Law of
Motion and the Law of Universal Gravitation. In what follows we prove Kepler’s First
Law. The remaining laws are left as a project (with hints).
Since the gravitational force of the Sun on a planet is so much larger than the forces
exerted by other celestial bodies, we can safely ignore all bodies in the universe except
the Sun and one planet revolving about it. We use a coordinate system with the Sun at
the origin and we let 
be the position vector of the planet. (Equally well,
could be the position vector of the Moon or a satellite moving around Earth or a comet
moving around a star.) The velocity vector is 
and the acceleration vector is
. We use the following laws of Newton:
where 
is the gravitational force on the planet,
and 
are the masses of the planet
and the Sun,
is the gravitational constant,
, and 
is the unit vec-
tor in the direction of .
We ﬁrst show that the planet moves in one plane. By equating the expressions for
in Newton’s two laws, we ﬁnd that
and so 
is parallel to . It follows that 
. We use Formula 5 in Theorem
10.2.3 to write
Therefore
where 
is a constant vector. (We may assume that 
; that is,
and are not par-
allel.) This means that the vector 
is perpendicular to 
for all values of t, so

the planet always lies in the plane through the origin perpendicular to . Thus, the
orbit of the planet is a plane curve.
To prove Kepler’s First Law we rewrite the vector 
as follows:
Then
(by Formula 9.4.8)
But 
and, since 
, it follows from Example 5 in Section 10.2
that 
. Therefore
and so
Integrating both sides of this equation, we get
where is a constant vector.
At this point it is convenient to choose the coordinate axes so that the standard basis
vector points in the direction of the vector . Then the planet moves in the 
-plane.
Since both 
and 
are perpendicular to , Equation 11 shows that 
lies in the 
-plane. This means that we can choose the - and -axes so that the vector lies in 
the direction of , as shown in Figure 8.
If 
is the angle between 
and , then 
are polar coordinates of the planet.
From Equation 11 we have
where

Writing 
, we obtain the equation
In Appendix H it is shown that Equation 12 is the polar equation of a conic section
with focus at the origin and eccentricity . We know that the orbit of a planet is a
closed curve and so the conic must be an ellipse.
This completes the derivation of Kepler’s First Law. We will guide you through the
derivation of the Second and Third Laws in the Applied Project on page 735. The
proofs of these three laws show that the methods of this chapter provide a powerful
tool for describing some of the laws of nature.

CHAPTER 10 VECTOR FUNCTIONS

Kepler’s Laws
Johannes Kepler stated the following three laws of planetary motion on the basis of masses
of data on the positions of the planets at various times.
Kepler’s Laws
1. A planet revolves around the Sun in an elliptical orbit with the Sun at one focus.
2. The line joining the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
3. The square of the period of revolution of a planet is proportional to the cube of the
length of the major axis of its orbit.
Kepler formulated these laws because they ﬁtted the astronomical data. He wasn’t able to
see why they were true or how they related to each other. But Sir Isaac Newton, in his
Principia Mathematica of 1687, showed how to deduce Kepler’s three laws from two of
Newton’s own laws, the Second Law of Motion and the Law of Universal Gravitation. In
Section 10.4 we proved Kepler’s First Law using the calculus of vector functions. In this
project we guide you through the proofs of Kepler’s Second and Third Laws and explore
some of their consequences.
1. Use the following steps to prove Kepler’s Second Law. The notation is the same as in 
the proof of the First Law in Section 10.4. In particular, use polar coordinates so that
.
(a) Show that 
.
(b) Deduce that 
.
(c) If 
is the area swept out by the radius vector 
in the time interval
as in the ﬁgure, show that
(d) Deduce that
This says that the rate at which 
is swept out is constant and proves Kepler’s
Second Law.
2. Let 
be the period of a planet about the Sun; that is,
is the time required for it to
travel once around its elliptical orbit. Suppose that the lengths of the major and minor
axes of the ellipse are 
and 
.
(a) Use part (d) of Problem 1 to show that 
.
(b) Show that 
.
(c) Use parts (a) and (b) to show that 
.
This proves Kepler’s Third Law. [Notice that the proportionality constant 
is
independent of the planet.]

3. The period of Earth’s orbit is approximately 365.25 days. Use this fact and Kepler’s
Third Law to ﬁnd the length of the major axis of Earth’s orbit. You will need the 
mass of the Sun,
kg, and the gravitational constant,
	kg .
4. It’s possible to place a satellite into orbit about Earth so that it remains ﬁxed above a
given location on the equator. Compute the altitude that is needed for such a satellite.
Earth’s mass is 
; its radius is 
. (This orbit is called the
Clarke Geosynchronous Orbit after Arthur C. Clarke, who ﬁrst proposed the idea in
1948. The ﬁrst such satellite, Syncom II, was launched in July 1963.)

In Section 9.6 we looked at surfaces that are graphs of functions of two variables. Here
we use vector functions to discuss more general surfaces, called parametric surfaces.
In much the same way that we describe a space curve by a vector function 
of
a single parameter , we can describe a surface by a vector function 
of two param-
eters 
and . We suppose that
is a vector-valued function deﬁned on a region 
in the 
-plane. So x, y, and , the
component functions of r, are functions of the two variables u and with domain D.
The set of all points 
in 
such that
and 
varies throughout , is called a parametric surface
and Equations 2 are
called parametric equations of . Each choice of u and gives a point on S; by mak-
ing all choices, we get all of S. In other words, the surface is traced out by the tip of
the position vector 
as 
moves throughout the region 
(see Figure 1).

SOLUTION The parametric equations for this surface are
So for any point 
on the surface, we have
This means that vertical cross-sections parallel to the 
-plane (that is, with y con-
stant) are all circles with radius 4. Since 
and no restriction is placed on , the
surface is a circular cylinder with radius 2 whose axis is the y-axis (see Figure 2).
In Example 1 we placed no restrictions on the parameters u and and so we got the
entire cylinder. If, for instance, we restrict u and by writing the parameter domain as
then
and we get the quarter-cylinder with length 3 illustrated
in Figure 3.
If a parametric surface S is given by a vector function 
, then there are two
useful families of curves that lie on S, one family with u constant and the other with
constant. These families correspond to vertical and horizontal lines in the 
-plane.
If we keep constant by putting 
becomes a vector function of the
single parameter and deﬁnes a curve 
lying on . (See Figure 4.)
Similarly, if we keep 
constant by putting 
given by
that lies on . We call these curves grid curves. (In Example 1, for instance,
the grid curves obtained by letting u be constant are horizontal lines whereas the grid
curves with constant are circles.) In fact, when a computer graphs a parametric sur-
face, it usually depicts the surface by plotting these grid curves, as we see in the fol-
lowing example.
EXAMPLE 2 Use a computer algebra system to graph the surface
Which grid curves have u constant? Which have constant?
SOLUTION We graph the portion of the surface with parametric domain 
in Figure 5. It has the appearance of a spiral tube. To identify the grid

curves, we write the corresponding parametric equations:
If is constant, then 
and 
are constant, so the parametric equations 
resemble those of the helix in Example 4 in Section 10.1. So the grid curves with 
constant are the spiral curves in Figure 5. We deduce that the grid curves with u
constant must be the curves that look like circles in the ﬁgure. Further evidence for
this assertion is that if u is kept constant,
, then the equation 
shows that the -values vary from 
to 
.
In Examples 1 and 2 we were given a vector equation and asked to graph the cor-
responding parametric surface. In the following examples, however, we are given the
more challenging problem of ﬁnding a vector function to represent a given surface. In
the rest of this chapter we will often need to do exactly that.
EXAMPLE 3 Find a vector function that represents the plane that passes through the
point 
with position vector 
and that contains two nonparallel vectors a and b.
SOLUTION If P is any point in the plane, we can get from 
to 
by moving a certain
distance in the direction of 
and another distance in the direction of . So there are
scalars u and such that P0P

means of the Parallelogram Law, for the case where 
and are positive. See also
Exercise 30 in Section 9.2.) If r is the position vector of P, then

So the vector equation of the plane can be written as

If we write

, and

then we can write the parametric equations of the plane through the point 
as follows:
EXAMPLE 4 Find a parametric representation of the sphere
SOLUTION The sphere has a simple representation 
in spherical coordinates, so
let’s choose the angles 
and 
in spherical coordinates as the parameters (see Sec-
tion 9.7). Then, putting 
in the equations for conversion from spherical to
rectangular coordinates (Equations 9.7.3), we obtain
as the parametric equations of the sphere. The corresponding vector equation is

latitude (including the equator). The grid curves with

(semicircles), which connect the north and south poles.

equation of the form 
, can always be regarded as a parametric surface by
taking and as parameters and writing the parametric equations as

The next example shows two ways to parametrize a cone.

computer. For instance, let’s consider the surface 
obtained by rotating the curve

. Let be the angle of rotation 
as shown in Figure 9. If

Therefore, we take and as parameters and regard Equations 3 as parametric equa-
tions of . The parameter domain is given by

revolution.
SOLUTION From Equations 3, the parametric equations are
and the parameter domain is

. Using a computer to plot
these equations and rotate the image, we obtain the graph in Figure 10.
We can adapt Equations 3 to represent a surface obtained through revolution about
the - or -axis. (See Exercise 28.)

. The period
of the
particle is the time required for one complete revolution. Conclude that
(c) Find the acceleration vector . Show that it is proportional to and that it points

ation. Show that the magnitude of the acceleration vector is 
.
(d) Suppose that the particle has mass . Show that the magnitude of the force 
that is
required to produce this motion, called a centripetal force, is
2. A circular curve of radius 
on a highway is banked at an angle 
so that a car can
safely traverse the curve without skidding when there is no friction between the road
and the tires. The loss of friction could occur, for example, if the road is covered with a
ﬁlm of water or ice. The rated speed 
of the curve is the maximum speed that a car
can attain without skidding. Suppose a car of mass 
is traversing the curve at the rated
speed 
Two forces are acting on the car: the vertical force,
, due to the weight of
the car, and a force 
exerted by, and normal to, the road. (See the ﬁgure.)
The vertical component of 
balances the weight of the car, so that

The horizontal component of

ton’s Second Law and part (d) of Problem 1,

3. A projectile is ﬁred from the origin with angle of elevation 
and initial speed .
Assuming that air resistance is negligible and that the only force acting on the projec-
tile is gravity, , we showed in Example 5 in Section 10.4 that the position vector of the
projectile is
We also showed that the maximum horizontal distance of the projectile is achieved
when 
and in this case the range is 
.
(a) At what angle should the projectile be ﬁred to achieve maximum height and what is
the maximum height?
(b) Fix the initial speed 
and consider the parabola 
, whose graph
is shown in the ﬁgure. Show that the projectile can hit any target inside or on the
boundary of the region bounded by the parabola and the -axis, and that it can’t hit
any target outside this region.
(c) Suppose that the gun is elevated to an angle of inclination 
in order to aim at a
target that is suspended at a height 
directly over a point 
units downrange. The
target is released at the instant the gun is ﬁred. Show that the projectile always hits
the target, regardless of the value , provided the projectile does not hit the ground
“before”
.
4. (a) A projectile is ﬁred from the origin down an inclined plane that makes an angle 
with the horizontal. The angle of elevation of the gun and the initial speed of the
projectile are 
and , respectively. Find the position vector of the projectile and
the parametric equations of the path of the projectile as functions of the time .
(Ignore air resistance.)
(b) Show that the angle of elevation 
that will maximize the downhill range is the
angle halfway between the plane and the vertical.
(c) Suppose the projectile is ﬁred up an inclined plane whose angle of inclination is .
Show that, in order to maximize the (uphill) range, the projectile should be ﬁred in
the direction halfway between the plane and the vertical.
(d) In a paper presented in 1686, Edmond Halley summarized the laws of gravity and
projectile motion and applied them to gunnery. One problem he posed involved
ﬁring a projectile to hit a target a distance 
up an inclined plane. Show that the
angle at which the projectile should be ﬁred to hit the target but use the least
amount of energy is the same as the angle in part (c). (Use the fact that the energy
needed to ﬁre the projectile is proportional to the square of the initial speed, so
minimizing the energy is equivalent to minimizing the initial speed.)
5. A projectile of mass 
is ﬁred from the origin at an angle of elevation . In addition to
gravity, assume that air resistance provides a force that is proportional to the velocity
and that opposes the motion. Then, by Newton’s Second Law, the total force acting on

In Section 9.6 we discussed functions of two variables and their graphs. Here we study
functions of two or more variables from four points of view:
I
verbally
(by a description in words)
I
numerically
(by a table of values)
I
algebraically
(by an explicit formula)
I
visually
(by a graph or level curves)
Recall that a function 
of two variables is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair
of real numbers in its domain a unique real number denoted by 
. In
Example 3 in Section 9.6 we looked at the wave heights 
in the open sea as a func-
tion of the wind speed and the length of time that the wind has been blowing at that
speed. We presented a table of observed wave heights that represent the function
numerically. The function in the next example is also described verbally
and numerically.
EXAMPLE 1 In regions with severe winter weather, the wind-chill index is often used
to describe the apparent severity of the cold. This index I is a subjective temperature
that depends on the actual temperature T and the wind speed . So I is a function 
of T and , and we can write 
. The following table records values of I

Physical quantities often depend on two or more variables. In this chapter 
we extend the basic ideas of differential calculus to such functions.
TABLE 1
Wind-chill index as a function of air 
temperature and wind speed

compiled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National
Weather Service.
For instance, the table shows that if the temperature is 
and the wind speed is
40 kmh, then subjectively it would feel as cold as a temperature of about 
with no wind. So
EXAMPLE 2 In 1928 Charles Cobb and Paul Douglas published a study in which they
modeled the growth of the American economy during the period 1899–1922. They
considered a simpliﬁed view of the economy in which production output is deter-
mined by the amount of labor involved and the amount of capital invested. While
there are many other factors affecting economic performance, their model proved to
be remarkably accurate. The function they used to model production was of the form
where P is the total production (the monetary value of all goods produced in a year),
L is the amount of labor (the total number of person-hours worked in a year), and K
is the amount of capital invested (the monetary worth of all machinery, equipment,
and buildings). In Section 11.3 we will show how the form of Equation 1 follows
from certain economic assumptions.
Cobb and Douglas used economic data published by the government to obtain
Table 2. They took the year 1899 as a baseline and P, L, and K for 1899 were each
assigned the value 100. The values for other years were expressed as percentages of 
the 1899 ﬁgures.
Cobb and Douglas used the method of least squares to ﬁt the data of Table 2 to
the function
(See Exercise 45 for the details.)
If we use the model given by the function in Equation 2 to compute the produc-
tion in the years 1910 and 1920, we get the values
which are quite close to the actual values, 159 and 231.
The production function (1) has subsequently been used in many settings, ranging
from individual ﬁrms to global economic questions. It has become known as the 
Cobb-Douglas production function.
The domain of the production function in Example 2 is 
because 
and 
represent labor and capital and are therefore never negative. For a
function 
given by an algebraic formula, recall that the domain consists of all pairs
for which the expression for 
is a well-deﬁned real number.

Visual Representations
One way to visualize a function of two variables is through its graph. Recall from
Section 9.6 that the graph of 
is the surface with equation 
.
EXAMPLE 4 Sketch the graph of 
.
SOLUTION The graph has equation 
. We square both sides of this
equation to obtain 
, or 
, which we recognize as
an equation of the sphere with center the origin and radius 3. But, since 
, the
graph of is just the top half of this sphere (see Figure 2).
EXAMPLE 5 Use a computer to draw the graph of the Cobb-Douglas production func-
tion 
.
SOLUTION Figure 3 shows the graph of P for values of the labor L and capital K that
lie between 0 and 300. The computer has drawn the surface by plotting vertical
traces. We see from these traces that the value of the production P increases as
either L or K increases, as is to be expected.
Another method for visualizing functions, borrowed from mapmakers, is a contour
map on which points of constant elevation are joined to form contour lines, or level
curves.
Definition The level curves of a function 
of two variables are the curves with
equations 
, where is a constant (in the range of ).
A level curve 
is the set of all points in the domain of at which takes
on a given value . In other words, it shows where the graph of 
has height .k

You can see from Figure 4 the relation between level curves and horizontal traces.
The level curves 
are just the traces of the graph of in the horizontal plane
projected down to the 
-plane. So if you draw the level curves of a function
and visualize them being lifted up to the surface at the indicated height, then you can
mentally piece together a picture of the graph. The surface is steep where the level
curves are close together. It is somewhat ﬂatter where they are farther apart.
One common example of level curves occurs in topographic maps of mountainous
regions, such as the map in Figure 5. The level curves are curves of constant elevation
above sea level. If you walk along one of these contour lines you neither ascend nor
descend. Another common example is the temperature at locations 
with longitude
and latitude . Here the level curves are called isothermals and join locations with

ure 10(a) shows a contour map of h drawn by a computer with level curves corre-
sponding to 
. Figure 10(b) shows these level curves lifted
up to the graph of h (an elliptic paraboloid) where they become horizontal traces.
We see from Figure 10 how the graph of h is put together from the level curves.
EXAMPLE 10 Plot level curves for the Cobb-Douglas production function of
Example 2.
SOLUTION In Figure 11 we use a computer to draw a contour plot for the Cobb-
Douglas production function
Level curves are labeled with the value of the production P. For instance, the level
curve labeled 140 shows all values of the labor L and capital investment K that
result in a production of 
. We see that, for a ﬁxed value of P, as L increases
K decreases, and vice versa.
For some purposes, a contour map is more useful than a graph. That is certainly
true in Example 10. (Compare Figure 11 with Figure 3.) It is also true in estimating
function values, as in Example 6.
Figure 12 shows some computer-generated level curves together with the corre-
sponding computer-generated graphs. Notice that the level curves in part (c) crowd

Functions of Three or More Variables
A function of three variables,
, is a rule that assigns to each ordered triple 
in a domain 
a unique real number denoted by 
. For instance, the tem-
perature 
at a point on the surface of the Earth depends on the longitude x and lati-
tude y of the point and on the time t, so we could write 
.

It’s very difﬁcult to visualize a function 
of three variables by its graph, since that
would lie in a four-dimensional space. However, we do gain some insight into 
by
examining its level surfaces, which are the surfaces with equations 
,
where 
is a constant. If the point 
moves along a level surface, the value of
remains ﬁxed.
EXAMPLE 12 Find the level surfaces of the function
SOLUTION The level surfaces are 
, where 
. These form a family 
of concentric spheres with radius 
. (See Figure 13.) Thus, as 
varies over
any sphere with center , the value of 
remains ﬁxed.
Functions of any number of variables can be considered. A function of n variables
is a rule that assigns a number 
to an -tuple 
of
real numbers. We denote by 
the set of all such n-tuples. For example, if a company
uses different ingredients in making a food product,
is the cost per unit of the 
ingredient, and 
units of the 
ingredient are used, then the total cost 
of the ingre-
dients is a function of the 
variables 
:
The function 
is a real-valued function whose domain is a subset of 
. Some-
times we will use vector notation in order to write such functions more compactly: If
, we often write 
in place of 
. With this nota-
tion we can rewrite the function deﬁned in Equation 3 as
where 
and 
denotes the dot product of the vectors c and x
in 
.
In view of the one-to-one correspondence between points 
in 
and
their position vectors 
in 
, we have three ways of looking at a
function f deﬁned on a subset of 
:
1. As a function of 
real variables 
2. As a function of a single point variable 
3. As a function of a single vector variable 
We will see that all three points of view are useful.

Let’s compare the behavior of the functions

for points 
near the origin. (Notice that neither function is deﬁned at the origin.)
It appears that as 
approaches (0, 0), the values of

whereas the values of 
aren’t approaching any number. It turns out that these
guesses based on numerical evidence are correct, and we write

In general, we use the notation
to indicate that the values of 
approach the number L as the point 
approaches the point 
along any path that stays within the domain of

sufﬁciently close to the point

CHAPTER 11 PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
L A more precise deﬁnition of the limit
of a function of two variables is given in
Appendix D.

For functions of a single variable, when we let 
approach , there are only two
possible directions of approach, from the left or from the right. We recall from Chap-
ter 2 that if 
, then 
does not exist.
For functions of two variables the situation is not as simple because we can let
approach 
from an inﬁnite number of directions in any manner whatsoever
(see Figure 1) as long as 
stays within the domain of .
Deﬁnition 1 says that the distance between 
and L can be made arbitrarily
small by making the distance from 
to 
sufﬁciently small (but not 0). The
deﬁnition refers only to the distance between 
and 
. It does not refer to the
direction of approach. Therefore, if the limit exists, then 
must approach the
same limit no matter how 
approaches 
. Thus, if we can ﬁnd two different
paths of approach along which the function 
has different limits, then it follows
that 
does not exist.
If 
as 
along a path 
and 
as
along a path 
, where 
, then 
does 
not exist.
EXAMPLE 1 Show that 
does not exist.
SOLUTION Let 
. First let’s approach 
along the 
-axis. Then 
gives 
for all 
, so
We now approach along the -axis by putting 
. Then 
for 
all 
, so
(See Figure 2.) Since 
has two different limits along two different lines, the given
limit does not exist. (This conﬁrms the conjecture we made on the basis of numeri-
cal evidence at the beginning of this section.)
EXAMPLE 2 If 
, does 
exist?
SOLUTION If 
, then 
. Therefore
If 
, then 
, so
Although we have obtained identical limits along the axes, that does not show that
the given limit is 0. Let’s now approach 
along another line, say 
. For all
,
Therefore
(See Figure 3.) Since we have obtained different limits along different paths, the
given limit does not exist.

corresponds to the fact that

EXAMPLE 3 If

SOLUTION With the solution of Example 2 in mind, let’s try to save time by letting
along any nonvertical line through the origin. Then 
, where 
is the slope, and
So
Thus,
has the same limiting value along every nonvertical line through the origin.
But that does not show that the given limit is 0, for if we now let 
along the parabola 
, we have
so
Since different paths lead to different limiting values, the given limit does not exist.
Now let’s look at limits that do exist. Just as for functions of one variable, the cal-
culation of limits for functions of two variables can be greatly simpliﬁed by the use of
properties of limits. The Limit Laws listed in Section 2.3 can be extended to functions
of two variables. The limit of a sum is the sum of the limits, the limit of a product is
the product of the limits, and so on. In particular, the following equations are true.
The Squeeze Theorem also holds.
EXAMPLE 4 Find 
if it exists.
SOLUTION As in Example 3, we could show that the limit along any line through the
origin is 0. This doesn’t prove that the given limit is 0, but the limits along the
parabolas 
and 
also turn out to be 0, so we begin to suspect that the
limit does exist and is equal to 0.
To prove it we look at the distance from 
to 0:

Continuity
Recall that evaluating limits of continuous functions of a single variable is easy. It can
be accomplished by direct substitution because the deﬁning property of a continuous
function is 
. Continuous functions of two variables are also deﬁned
by the direct substitution property.
Definition A function 
of two variables is called continuous at
if
We say 
is continuous on 
if 
is continuous at every point 
in .
The intuitive meaning of continuity is that if the point 
changes by a small
amount, then the value of 
changes by a small amount. This means that a sur-
face that is the graph of a continuous function has no hole or break.
Using the properties of limits, you can see that sums, differences, products, and
quotients of continuous functions are continuous on their domains. Let’s use this fact
to give examples of continuous functions.
A polynomial function of two variables (or polynomial, for short) is a sum of
terms of the form 
, where is a constant and 
and 
are nonnegative integers.
A rational function is a ratio of polynomials. For instance,
is a polynomial, whereas
is a rational function.
The limits in (2) show that the functions 
,
, and 
are continuous. Since any polynomial can be built up out of the simple functions ,
, and by multiplication and addition, it follows that all polynomials are continuous
on 
. Likewise, any rational function is continuous on its domain because it is a quo-
tient of continuous functions.

EXAMPLE 5 Evaluate 
.
SOLUTION Since 
is a polynomial, it is continuous
everywhere, so we can ﬁnd the limit by direct substitution:
EXAMPLE 6 Where is the function 
continuous?
SOLUTION The function 
is discontinuous at 
because it is not deﬁned there. 
Since 
is a rational function, it is continuous on its domain, which is the set
.
EXAMPLE 7 Let
Here is deﬁned at 
but is still discontinuous at 0 because

EXAMPLE 8 Let
We know

since it is equal to a rational function
there. Also, from Example 4, we have
Therefore,
is continuous at 
, and so it is continuous on 
.
Just as for functions of one variable, composition is another way of combining 
two continuous functions to get a third. In fact, it can be shown that if
is a contin-
uous function of two variables and 
is a continuous function of a single variable 
that is deﬁned on the range of , then the composite function 
deﬁned by
is also a continuous function.
EXAMPLE 9 Where is the function 
continuous?
SOLUTION The function 
is a rational function and therefore continuous
except on the line 
. The function 
is continuous everywhere. So
the composite function
is continuous except where

On a hot day, extreme humidity makes us think the temperature is higher than it really 
is, whereas in very dry air we perceive the temperature to be lower than the ther-
mometer indicates. The National Weather Service has devised the heat index (also
called the temperature-humidity index, or humidex) to describe the combined effects
of temperature and humidity. The heat index I is the perceived air temperature when
the actual temperature is T and the relative humidity is H. So I is a function of T and
H and we can write 
. The following table of values of I is an excerpt from
a table compiled by the National Weather Service.

Heat index as a function of temperature and humidity
If we concentrate on the highlighted column of the table, which corresponds to a
relative humidity of H  70%, we are considering the heat index as a function of the

single variable T for a ﬁxed value of H. Let’s write 
. Then 
de-
scribes how the heat index I increases as the actual temperature T increases when the
relative humidity is 70%. The derivative of t when 
is the rate of change of
I with respect to T when 
:
We can approximate it using the values in Table 1 by taking h  2 and 
:
Averaging these values, we can say that the derivative 
is approximately 3.75.
This means that, when the actual temperature is 
and the relative humidity is
70%, the apparent temperature (heat index) rises by about 
for every degree
that the actual temperature rises!
Now let’s look at the highlighted row in Table 1, which corresponds to a ﬁxed
temperature of 
. The numbers in this row are values of the function
, which describes how the heat index increases as the relative humid-
ity H increases when the actual temperature is 
. The derivative of this func-
tion when H  70% is the rate of change of I with respect to H when H  70%:
By taking h  5 and 5, we approximate 
using the tabular values:
By averaging these values we get the estimate 
. This says that, when the
temperature is 96 °F and the relative humidity is 70%, the heat index rises about 
for every percent that the relative humidity rises.
In general, if 
is a function of two variables 
and , suppose we let only 
vary
while keeping ﬁxed, say 
, where is a constant. Then we are really consider-
ing a function of a single variable , namely,

With this notation for partial derivatives, we can write the rates of change of the

CHAPTER 11 PARTIAL DERIVATIVES

To compute partial derivatives, all we have to do is remember from Equation 1 that 
the partial derivative with respect to is just the ordinary derivative of the function 
of a single variable that we get by keeping ﬁxed. Thus, we have the following rule.
Rule for Finding Partial Derivatives of
1. To ﬁnd 
, regard as a constant and differentiate 
with respect to .
2. To ﬁnd 
, regard as a constant and differentiate 
with respect to .
EXAMPLE 1 If 
, ﬁnd 
and

SOLUTION Holding constant and differentiating with respect to , we get
and so

Interpretations of Partial Derivatives
To give a geometric interpretation of partial derivatives, we recall that the equation
represents a surface 
(the graph of 
). If 
, then the point
lies on . By ﬁxing 
, we are restricting our attention to the curve 
in
which the vertical plane 
intersects S. (In other words,
is the trace of in the
plane 
.) Likewise, the vertical plane 
intersects in a curve 
. Both of the
curves 
and 
pass through the point . (See Figure 1.)
Notice that the curve 
is the graph of the function 
, so the slope 
of its tangent
at
is
. The curve
is the graph of the function
, so the slope of its tangent 
at 
is 
.
Thus, the partial derivatives 
and 
can be interpreted geometrically
as the slopes of the tangent lines at 
to the traces 
and 
of in the planes
and 
.
As we have seen in the case of the heat index function, partial derivatives can also
be interpreted as rates of change. If 
, then 
represents the rate of
change of 
with respect to 
when 
is ﬁxed. Similarly,
represents the rate 
of change of with respect to when is ﬁxed.
EXAMPLE 2 If 
, ﬁnd 
and 
and interpret these
numbers as slopes.
SOLUTION We have
The graph of

and the vertical plane 
intersects it in the parabola

CHAPTER 11 PARTIAL DERIVATIVES

Notice that 
in Example 6. This is not just a coincidence. It turns out that
the mixed partial derivatives 
and 
are equal for most functions that one meets in
practice. The following theorem, which was discovered by the French mathematician
Alexis Clairaut (1713–1765), gives conditions under which we can assert that 
.
The proof is given in Appendix E.
Clairaut’s Theorem Suppose 
is deﬁned on a disk 
that contains the point
. If the functions 
and 
are both continuous on , then
Partial derivatives of order 3 or higher can also be deﬁned. For instance,

L Alexis Clairaut was a child prodigy 
in mathematics, having read l’Hospital’s
textbook on calculus when he was ten
and presented a paper on geometry to
the French Academy of Sciences when
he was 13. At the age of 18, Clairaut
published Recherches sur les courbes à
double courbure, which was the ﬁrst 
systematic treatise on three-dimensional
analytic geometry and included the 
calculus of space curves.

and using Clairaut’s Theorem it can be shown that 
if these functions
are continuous.
EXAMPLE 7 Calculate 
if 
.
SOLUTION
Partial Differential Equations
Partial derivatives occur in partial differential equations that express certain physical
laws. For instance, the partial differential equation
is called Laplace’s equation after Pierre Laplace (1749–1827). Solutions of this equa-
tion are called harmonic functions and play a role in problems of heat conduction,
ﬂuid ﬂow, and electric potential.
EXAMPLE 8 Show that the function 
is a solution of Laplace’s 
equation.
SOLUTION
Therefore,
satisﬁes Laplace’s equation.
The wave equation
describes the motion of a waveform, which could be an ocean wave, a sound wave, a
light wave, or a wave traveling along a vibrating string. For instance, if 
repre-
sents the displacement of a vibrating violin string at time and at a distance 
from
one end of the string (as in Figure 8), then 
satisﬁes the wave equation. Here the
constant 
depends on the density of the string and on the tension in the string.
EXAMPLE 9 Verify that the function 
satisﬁes the wave equation.
SOLUTION
So 
satisﬁes the wave equation.

The Cobb-Douglas Production Function
In Example 2 in Section 11.1 we described the work of Cobb and Douglas in model-
ing the total production P of an economic system as a function of the amount of labor
L and the capital investment K. Here we use partial derivatives to show how the par-
ticular form of their model follows from certain assumptions they made about the
economy.
If the production function is denoted by 
, then the partial derivative
is the rate at which production changes with respect to the amount of labor.
Economists call it the marginal production with respect to labor or the marginal pro-
ductivity of labor. Likewise, the partial derivative 
is the rate of change of pro-
duction with respect to capital and is called the marginal productivity of capital. In
these terms, the assumptions made by Cobb and Douglas can be stated as follows.
(i) If either labor or capital vanishes, then so will production.
(ii) The marginal productivity of labor is proportional to the amount of produc-
tion per unit of labor.
(iii) The marginal productivity of capital is proportional to the amount of pro-
duction per unit of capital.
Because the production per unit of labor is 
, assumption (ii) says that
for some constant . If we keep K constant 
, then this partial differential
equation becomes an ordinary differential equation:
If we solve this separable differential equation by the methods of Section 7.3 (see also
Exercise 67), we get
Notice that we have written the constant 
as a function of 
because it could depend
on the value of 
.
Similarly, assumption (iii) says that
and we can solve this differential equation to get
Comparing Equations 6 and 7, we have

where b is a constant that is independent of both L and K. Assumption (i) shows that
and 
.
Notice from Equation 8 that if labor and capital are both increased by a factor m,
then
If 
, then 
, which means that production is also 
increased by a factor of m. That is why Cobb and Douglas assumed that 
and therefore
This is the Cobb-Douglas production function that we discussed in Section 11.1.

(b) Honolulu has longitude 
and latitude 
. Sup-
pose that at 9:00 A.M. on January 1 the wind is blowing
hot air to the northeast, so the air to the west and south
is warm and the air to the north and east is cooler.
Would you expect

. What are the practical interpreta-
tions of these values?
3. The wind-chill index is the perceived temperature when
the actual temperature is

One of the most important ideas in single-variable calculus is that as we zoom in
toward a point on the graph of a differentiable function the graph becomes indistin-
guishable from its tangent line and we can approximate the function by a linear func-
tion. (See Sections 2.9 and 3.8.) Here we develop similar ideas in three dimensions.
As we zoom in toward a point on a surface that is the graph of a differentiable func-
tion of two variables, the surface looks more and more like a plane (its tangent plane)
and we can approximate the function by a linear function of two variables. We also
extend the idea of a differential to functions of two or more variables.
Tangent Planes
Suppose a surface 
has equation 
, where 
has continuous ﬁrst partial
derivatives, and let 
be a point on . As in the preceding section, let 
and

be the curves obtained by intersecting the vertical planes 
and 
with
the surface . Then the point 
lies on both 
and 
. Let 
and 
be the tangent
lines to the curves 
and 
at the point . Then the tangent plane to the surface 
at the point 
is deﬁned to be the plane that contains both tangent lines 
and 
. (See
Figure 1.)
We will see in Section 11.6 that if 
is any other curve that lies on the surface 
and passes through , then its tangent line at 
also lies in the tangent plane. There-
fore, you can think of the tangent plane to 
at 
as consisting of all possible tangent
lines at 
to curves that lie on and pass through . The tangent plane at 
is the plane
that most closely approximates the surface 
near the point .
We know from Equation 9.5.6 that any plane passing through the point 
has an equation of the form
By dividing this equation by 
and letting 
and 
, we can write
it in the form
If Equation 1 represents the tangent plane at , then its intersection with the plane
must be the tangent line 
. Setting 
in Equation 1 gives
and we recognize these as the equations (in point-slope form) of a line with slope .
But from Section 11.3 we know that the slope of the tangent 
is 
. There-
fore,
.
Similarly, putting 
in Equation 1, we get 
, which must
represent the tangent line 
, so

Suppose

plane to the surface 
at the point

found in Example 1. In parts (b) and (c) we zoom in toward the point (1, 1, 3) by
restricting the domain of the function 
. Notice that the more we
zoom in, the ﬂatter the graph appears and the more it resembles its tangent plane.

In Figure 3 we corroborate this impression by zooming in toward the point (1, 1)
on a contour map of the function 
. Notice that the more we zoom
in, the more the level curves look like equally spaced parallel lines, which is charac-
teristic of a plane.
Linear Approximations
In Example 1 we found that an equation of the tangent plane to the graph of the func-
tion 
at the point (1, 1, 3) is 
. Therefore, in view
of the visual evidence in Figures 2 and 3, the linear function of two variables
is a good approximation to 
when 
is near (1, 1). The function L is called
the linearization of f at (1, 1) and the approximation
is called the linear approximation or tangent plane approximation of f at (1, 1).
For instance, at the point (1.1, 0.95) the linear approximation gives
which is quite close to the true value of 
.
But if we take a point farther away from (1, 1), such as (2, 3), we no longer get a good
approximation. In fact,

In general, we know from (2) that an equation of the tangent plane to the graph of
a function f of two variables at the point 
is
The linear function whose graph is this tangent plane, namely
is called the linearization of f at 
and the approximation
is called the linear approximation or the tangent plane approximation of at
We have deﬁned tangent planes for surfaces 
, where 
has continuous
ﬁrst partial derivatives. What happens if 
and 
are not continuous? Figure 4 pictures
such a function; its equation is
You can verify (see Exercise 40) that its partial derivatives exist at the origin and, in
fact,
and 
, but 
and 
are not continuous. The linear approx-
imation would be 
, but 
at all points on the line 
. So a
function of two variables can behave badly even though both of its partial derivatives
exist. To rule out such behavior, we formulate the idea of a differentiable function of
two variables.
Recall that for a function of one variable,
, if x changes from a to 
we deﬁned the increment of as
In Chapter 3 we showed that if 
is differentiable at a, then
Now consider a function of two variables,
, and suppose x changes from
a to 
and y changes from b to 
. Then the corresponding increment of
is
Thus, the increment 
represents the change in the value of 
when 
changes
from 
to 
. By analogy with (5) we deﬁne the differentiability
of a function of two variables as follows.

Deﬁnition 7 says that a differentiable function is one for which the linear approxi-
mation (4) is a good approximation when 
is near 
. In other words, the tan-
gent plane approximates the graph of f well near the point of tangency.
It’s sometimes hard to use Deﬁnition 7 directly to check the differentiability of 
a function, but the following theorem provides a convenient sufﬁcient condition for
differentiability.
Theorem If the partial derivatives

ous at

tion there. Then use it to approximate

EXAMPLE 5 The base radius and height of a right circular cone are measured as 
10 cm and 25 cm, respectively, with a possible error in measurement of as much as 
cm in each. Use differentials to estimate the maximum error in the calculated
volume of the cone.
SOLUTION The volume 
of a cone with base radius and height 
is 
. So
the differential of 
is
Since each error is at most 
cm, we have 
,
. To ﬁnd the
largest error in the volume we take the largest error in the measurement of and of
. Therefore, we take 
and 
along with 
,
. This gives
Thus, the maximum error in the calculated volume is about 
cm
cm .
Functions of Three or More Variables
Linear approximations, differentiability, and differentials can be deﬁned in a similar
manner for functions of more than two variables. A differentiable function is deﬁned
by an expression similar to the one in Deﬁnition 7. For such functions the linear
approximation is
and the linearization 
is the right side of this expression.
If 
, then the increment of 
is
The differential
is deﬁned in terms of the differentials 
,
, and 
of the inde-
pendent variables by
EXAMPLE 6 The dimensions of a rectangular box are measured to be 75 cm, 60 cm,
and 40 cm, and each measurement is correct to within 
cm. Use differentials to
estimate the largest possible error when the volume of the box is calculated from
these measurements.
SOLUTION If the dimensions of the box are , , and , its volume is 
and so
We are given that 
,
, and 
. To ﬁnd the largest error
in the volume, we therefore use 
,

CHAPTER 11 PARTIAL DERIVATIVES

Thus, an error of only 
cm in measuring each dimension could lead to an error of
as much as 1980 cm in the calculated volume! This may seem like a large error, but
it’s only about 1% of the volume of the box.
Tangent Planes to Parametric Surfaces
Parametric surfaces were introduced in Section 10.5. We now ﬁnd the tangent plane
to a parametric surface 
traced out by a vector function
at a point 
with position vector 
. If we keep 
constant by putting 
,
then 
becomes a vector function of the single parameter 
and deﬁnes a grid
curve 
lying on . (See Figure 9.) The tangent vector to 
at 
is obtained by tak-
ing the partial derivative of with respect to :
Similarly, if we keep constant by putting 
, we get a grid curve 
given by
that lies on , and its tangent vector at 
is
If 
is not , then the surface 
is called smooth (it has no “corners”). For a
smooth surface, the tangent plane is the plane that contains the tangent vectors 
and
, and the vector 
is a normal vector to the tangent plane.
EXAMPLE 7 Find the tangent plane to the surface with parametric equations 
,
,
at the point 
.

We recall that the Chain Rule for functions of a single variable gives the rule for dif-
ferentiating a composite function: If 
and 
, where 
and are differ-
entiable functions, then is indirectly a differentiable function of and
For functions of more than one variable, the Chain Rule has several versions, each
of them giving a rule for differentiating a composite function. The ﬁrst version
(Theorem 2) deals with the case where 
and each of the variables 
and 
is, in turn, a function of a variable . This means that 
is indirectly a function of ,
, and the Chain Rule gives a formula for differentiating as a function
of . We assume that 
is differentiable (Deﬁnition 11.4.7). Recall that this is the case
when 
and 
are continuous (Theorem 11.4.8).
The Chain Rule (Case 1) Suppose that 
is a differentiable function
of and , where 
and 
are both differentiable functions of .
Then is a differentiable function of and
Proof A change of

produce a change of

CHAPTER 11 PARTIAL DERIVATIVES

Since we often write

form
EXAMPLE 1 If

when 
.
SOLUTION The Chain Rule gives
It’s not necessary to substitute the expressions for and in terms of . We simply
observe that when 
we have x  sin 0  0 and y  cos 0  1. Therefore,
The derivative in Example 1 can be interpreted as the rate of change of 
with
respect to as the point 
moves along the curve 
with parametric equations
,
. (See Figure 1.) In particular, when 
, the point 
is
and 
is the rate of increase as we move along the curve 
through
. If, for instance,
represents the temperature at the
point 
, then the composite function 
represents the tempera-
ture at points on 
and the derivative 
represents the rate at which the temper-
ature changes along .
EXAMPLE 2 The pressure 
(in kilopascals), volume 
(in liters), and temperature 
(in kelvins) of a mole of an ideal gas are related by the equation 
.
Find the rate at which the pressure is changing when the temperature is 
and
increasing at a rate of 
and the volume is 100 L and increasing at a rate of
.
SOLUTION If represents the time elapsed in seconds, then at the given instant we have
,

We now consider the situation where 
but each of 
and 
is a function
of two variables 
and :
,
. Then 
is indirectly a function of 
and and we wish to ﬁnd 
and 
. Recall that in computing 
we hold 
ﬁxed and compute the ordinary derivative of 
with respect to . Therefore, we can
apply Theorem 2 to obtain
A similar argument holds for 
and so we have proved the following version of
the Chain Rule.
The Chain Rule (Case 2) Suppose that 
is a differentiable function
of and , where 
and 
are differentiable functions of s
and t. Then
EXAMPLE 3 If 
, where 
and 
, ﬁnd 
and 
.
SOLUTION Applying Case 2 of the Chain Rule, we get
Case 2 of the Chain Rule contains three types of variables:
and are independ-
ent variables,
and are called intermediate variables, and is the dependent vari-
able. Notice that Theorem 3 has one term for each intermediate variable and each of
these terms resembles the one-dimensional Chain Rule in Equation 1.
To remember the Chain Rule it is helpful to draw the tree diagram in Figure 2. We
draw branches from the dependent variable to the intermediate variables 
and to
indicate that is a function of 
and . Then we draw branches from 
and 
to the
independent variables 
and . On each branch we write the corresponding partial
derivative. To ﬁnd 
we ﬁnd the product of the partial derivatives along each path
from to and then add these products:
Similarly, we ﬁnd 
by using the paths from to .
Now we consider the general situation in which a dependent variable 
is a func-
tion of 
intermediate variables 
,
, each of which is, in turn, a function of m

SOLUTION
(a) The Chain Rule gives
(b) Applying the Product Rule to the expression in part (a), we get
But, using the Chain Rule again (see Figure 5), we have
Putting these expressions into Equation 5 and using the equality of the mixed second-

Implicit Differentiation

implicit differentiation that was introduced in Sections 3.6 and 11.3. We suppose that

deﬁnes implicitly as a differentiable function of

is differen-
tiable, we can apply Case 1 of the Chain Rule to differentiate both sides of the equa-
tion

But 
, so if 
we solve for

To derive this equation we assumed that 
deﬁnes implicitly as a func-
tion of . The Implicit Function Theorem, proved in advanced calculus, gives con-
ditions under which this assumption is valid. It states that if 
is deﬁned on a disk con-
taining 
, where 
,
, and 
and 
are continuous on the
disk, then the equation 
deﬁnes 
as a function of

SOLUTION The given equation can be written as
so Equation 6 gives
Now we suppose that is given implicitly as a function 
by an equation
of the form 
. This means that 
for all 
in the
domain of . If 
and 
are differentiable, then we can use the Chain Rule to differ-
entiate the equation 
as follows:
But
so this equation becomes
If

The weather map in Figure 1 shows a contour map of the temperature function 
for the states of California and Nevada at 3:00 P.M. on October 10, 1997. The level
curves, or isothermals, join locations with the same temperature. The partial deriva-
tive 
at a location such as Reno is the rate of change of temperature with respect to
distance if we travel east from Reno; 
is the rate of change of temperature if we
travel north. But what if we want to know the rate of change of temperature when we
travel southeast (toward Las Vegas), or in some other direction? In this section we
introduce a type of derivative, called a directional derivative, that enables us to ﬁnd
the rate of change of a function of two or more variables in any direction.

tions of the unit vectors and .
Suppose that we now wish to ﬁnd the rate of change of at 
in the direction
of an arbitrary unit vector 
. (See Figure 2.) To do this we consider the sur-
face 
with equation 
(the graph of ) and we let 
. Then the
point 
lies on . The vertical plane that passes through 
in the direction
of 
intersects 
in a curve . (See Figure 3.) The slope of the tangent line 
to 
at
the point 
is the rate of change of in the direction of .
If

If we take the limit as

tance) in the direction of , which is called the directional derivative of 
in the direc-
tion of .
Definition The directional derivative of 
at

unit vector

By comparing Deﬁnition 2 with Equations 1, we see that if 
, then
and if 
, then 
. In other words, the partial derivatives
of 
with respect to and are just special cases of the directional derivative.
EXAMPLE 1 Use the weather map in Figure 1 to estimate the value of the directional
derivative of the temperature function at Reno in the southeasterly direction.
SOLUTION The unit vector directed toward the southeast is 
, but we
won’t need to use this expression. We start by drawing a line through Reno toward
the southeast. (See Figure 4.)
We approximate the directional derivative 
by the average rate of change of
the temperature between the points where this line intersects the isothermals 
and 
. The temperature at the point southeast of Reno is 
and the
temperature at the point northwest of Reno is 
. The distance between
these points looks to be about 75 miles. So the rate of change of the temperature in
the southeasterly direction is
When we compute the directional derivative of a function deﬁned by a formula, we
generally use the following theorem.
Theorem If 
is a differentiable function of and , then 
has a directional
derivative in the direction of any unit vector

The ﬁrst vector in this dot product occurs not only in computing directional deriv-
atives but in many other contexts as well. So we give it a special name (the gradient
of ) and a special notation (grad
or 
, which is read “del ”).
Definition If

is the vector function 
deﬁned by
EXAMPLE 3 If

and
With this notation for the gradient vector, we can rewrite the expression (7) for the
directional derivative as
This expresses the directional derivative in the direction of 
as the scalar projection
of the gradient vector onto .

Therefore, by Equation 9, we have
Functions of Three Variables
For functions of three variables we can deﬁne directional derivatives in a similar man-
ner. Again 
can be interpreted as the rate of change of the function in the
direction of a unit vector .

If we use vector notation, then we can write both deﬁnitions (2 and 10) of the direc-
tional derivative in the compact form

the vector equation of the line through

Maximizing the Directional Derivative
Suppose we have a function 
of two or three variables and we consider all possible
directional derivatives of 
at a given point. These give the rates of change of 
in all
possible directions. We can then ask the questions: In which of these directions does
change fastest and what is the maximum rate of change? The answers are provided
by the following theorem.
Theorem Suppose 
is a differentiable function of two or three variables.
The maximum value of the directional derivative 
is 
and it
occurs when 
has the same direction as the gradient vector 
.
Proof From Equation 9 or 14 we have
where 
is the angle between 
and . The maximum value of 
is 1 and this
occurs when 
. Therefore, the maximum value of 
is 
and it occurs
when 
, that is, when 
has the same direction as

mum rate of change?

At the point

By Theorem 15 the temperature increases fastest in the direction of the gradient
vector 
or, equivalently, in the direction of

increase is the length of the gradient vector:
Therefore, the maximum rate of increase of temperature is

Tangent Planes to Level Surfaces
Suppose 
is a surface with equation 
, that is, it is a level surface of a
function 
of three variables, and let 
be a point on . Let 
be any curve
that lies on the surface and passes through the point . Recall from Section 10.1 that
the curve 
is described by a continuous vector function 
. Let
be the parameter value corresponding to ; that is,
. Since 
lies
on , any point 
must satisfy the equation of , that is,
If , , and are differentiable functions of and 
is also differentiable, then we can
use the Chain Rule to differentiate both sides of Equation 16 as follows:
But, since 
and 
, Equation 17 can be writ-
ten in terms of a dot product as

In particular, when 
we have 
, so
Equation 18 says that the gradient vector at ,
, is perpendicular to the 
tangent vector 
to any curve 
on 
that passes through . (See Figure 9.) If
, it is therefore natural to deﬁne the tangent plane to the level sur-
face
at
as the plane that passes through 
and has normal
vector 
. Using the standard equation of a plane (Equation 9.5.6), we can
write the equation of this tangent plane as
The normal line to 
at 
is the line passing through 
and perpendicular to the
tangent plane. The direction of the normal line is therefore given by the gradient vec-
tor 
and so, by Equation 9.5.3, its symmetric equations are
In the special case in which the equation of a surface 
is of the form 
(that is,
is the graph of a function 
of two variables), we can rewrite the equation
as
and regard 
as a level surface (with 
) of . Then
so Equation 19 becomes
which is equivalent to Equation 11.4.2. Thus, our new, more general, deﬁnition of a
tangent plane is consistent with the deﬁnition that was given for the special case of
Section 11.4.

Significance of the Gradient Vector
We now summarize the ways in which the gradient vector is signiﬁcant. We ﬁrst con-
sider a function 
of three variables and a point 
in its domain. On the one
hand, we know from Theorem 15 that the gradient vector 
gives the direc-
tion of fastest increase of . On the other hand, we know that 
is orthog-
onal to the level surface 
of 
through . (Refer to Figure 9.) These two properties
are quite compatible intuitively because as we move away from 
on the level surface
, the value of 
does not change at all. So it seems reasonable that if we move in the
perpendicular direction, we get the maximum increase.
In like manner we consider a function 
of two variables and a point 
in
its domain. Again the gradient vector 
gives the direction of fastest increase
of . Also, by considerations similar to our discussion of tangent planes, it can be
shown that 
is perpendicular to the level curve 
that passes
through . Again this is intuitively plausible because the values of 
remain constant
as we move along the curve. (See Figure 11.)
If we consider a topographical map of a hill and let 
represent the height
above sea level at a point with coordinates 
, then a curve of steepest ascent can
be drawn as in Figure 12 by making it perpendicular to all of the contour lines. This
phenomenon can also be noticed in Figure 5 in Section 11.1, where Lonesome Creek
follows a curve of steepest descent.

gradient vector

As we saw in Chapter 4, one of the main uses of ordinary derivatives is in ﬁnding max-
imum and minimum values. In this section we see how to use partial derivatives to
locate maxima and minima of functions of two variables. In particular, in Example 6
we will see how to maximize the volume of a box without a lid if we have a ﬁxed
amount of cardboard to work with.
Definition A function of two variables has a local maximum at
if
when 
is near 
. [This means that 
for all points 
in some disk with center 
.] The number 
is
called a local maximum value. If 
when 
is near 
,
then 
is a local minimum value.
If the inequalities in Deﬁnition 1 hold for all points 
in the domain of , then
has an absolute maximum (or absolute minimum) at 
.
The graph of a function with several maxima and minima is shown in Figure 1. You
can think of the local maxima as mountain peaks and the local minima as valley bottoms.
Theorem If 
has a local maximum or minimum at 
and the ﬁrst-order
partial derivatives of 
exist there, then 
and 
.
Proof Let 
. If 
has a local maximum (or minimum) at 
, then 
has a local maximum (or minimum) at , so 
by Fermat’s Theorem (see
Theorem 4.2.4). But 
(see Equation 11.3.1) and so 
.
Similarly, by applying Fermat’s Theorem to the function 
, we obtain
.
Notice that the conclusion of Theorem 2 can be stated in the notation of the gradi-
ent vector as 
. If we put 
and 
in the equation of
a tangent plane (Equation 11.4.2), we get 
. Thus, the geometric interpretation of
Theorem 2 is that if the graph of 
has a tangent plane at a local maximum or mini-
mum, then the tangent plane must be horizontal.
A point 
is called a critical point (or stationary point) of if 
and
, or if one of these partial derivatives does not exist. Theorem 2 says that
if 
has a local maximum or minimum at 
, then 
is a critical point of .
However, as in single-variable calculus, not all critical points give rise to maxima or
minima. At a critical point, a function could have a local maximum or a local mini-
mum or neither.

EXAMPLE 1 Let

These partial derivatives are equal to 0 when

, so the only critical
point is 
. By completing the square, we ﬁnd that
Since 
and 
, we have 
for all values of and .
Therefore,
is a local minimum, and in fact it is the absolute minimum 
of . This can be conﬁrmed geometrically from the graph of 
which is the elliptic
paraboloid with vertex 
shown in Figure 2.
EXAMPLE 2 Find the extreme values of 
.
SOLUTION Since 
and 
, the only critical point is 
. Notice that for
points on the -axis we have 
, so 
(if 
). However, for
points on the -axis we have 
, so 
(if 
). Thus, every disk
with center 
contains points where 
takes positive values as well as points
where 
takes negative values. Therefore,
can’t be an extreme value for
, so 
has no extreme value.
Example 2 illustrates the fact that a function need not have a maximum or mini-
mum value at a critical point. Figure 3 shows how this is possible. The graph of 
is
the hyperbolic paraboloid 
, which has a horizontal tangent plane (
)
at the origin. You can see that 
is a maximum in the direction of the -axis
but a minimum in the direction of the -axis. Near the origin the graph has the shape
of a saddle and so 
is called a saddle point of .
We need to be able to determine whether or not a function has an extreme value at
a critical point. The following test, which is proved in Appendix E, is analogous to the
Second Derivative Test for functions of one variable.
Second Derivatives Test Suppose the second partial derivatives of 
are 
continuous on a disk with center 
, and suppose that 
and
[that is,
is a critical point of ]. Let
(a) If 
and 
, then 
is a local minimum.
(b) If 
and 
, then 
is a local maximum.
(c) If 
, then 
is not a local maximum or minimum.
NOTE 1
G In case (c) the point 
is called a saddle point of 
and the graph of 
crosses its tangent plane at 
.
NOTE 2
G If 
, the test gives no information:
could have a local maximum or
local minimum at 
, or 
could be a saddle point of .

EXAMPLE 3 Find the local maximum and minimum values and saddle points of

SOLUTION We ﬁrst locate the critical points:
Setting these partial derivatives equal to 0, we obtain the equations
To solve these equations we substitute 
from the ﬁrst equation into the second
one. This gives
so there are three real roots:
, ,
. The three critical points are 
,
,
and 
.
Next we calculate the second partial derivatives and 
:
Since 
, it follows from case (c) of the Second Derivatives Test
that the origin is a saddle point; that is,
has no local maximum or minimum at

In the ﬁrst case (

ﬁnd the roots to four decimal places:
(Alternatively, we could have used Newton’s method or a rootﬁnder to locate these
roots.) From Equation 6, the corresponding -values are given by

We could use the Second Derivatives Test to show that this gives a local maxi-

There is a similar situation for functions of two variables. Just as a closed interval
contains its endpoints, a closed set in 
is one that contains all its boundary points.
[A boundary point of D is a point 
such that every disk with center 
con-
tains points in D and also points not in D.] For instance, the disk
which consists of all points on and inside the circle 
, is a closed set
because it contains all of its boundary points (which are the points on the circle
). But if even one point on the boundary curve were omitted, the set would
not be closed. (See Figure 11.)
A bounded set in 
is one that is contained within some disk. In other words, it
is ﬁnite in extent. Then, in terms of closed and bounded sets, we can state the follow-
ing counterpart of the Extreme Value Theorem in two dimensions.
Extreme Value Theorem for Functions of Two Variables If 
is continuous on a
closed, bounded set 
in 
, then 
attains an absolute maximum value
and an absolute minimum value 
at some points 
and
in .
To ﬁnd the extreme values guaranteed by Theorem 8, we note that, by Theorem 2,
if 
has an extreme value at 
, then 
is either a critical point of 
or a
boundary point of 
. Thus, we have the following extension of the Closed Interval
Method.
To ﬁnd the absolute maximum and minimum values of a continuous func-
tion 
on a closed, bounded set 
:
1. Find the values of 
at the critical points of 
in .
2. Find the extreme values of

3. The largest of the values from steps 1 and 2 is the absolute maximum
value; the smallest of these values is the absolute minimum value.
EXAMPLE 7 Find the absolute maximum and minimum values of the function
on the rectangle 
.
SOLUTION Since 
is a polynomial, it is continuous on the closed, bounded rectangle
, so Theorem 8 tells us there is both an absolute maximum and an absolute mini-
mum. According to step 1 in (9), we ﬁrst ﬁnd the critical points. These occur when
so the only critical point is 
, and the value of 
there is 
.

CHAPTER 11 PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
Designing a Dumpster
For this project we locate a trash dumpster in order to study its shape and construction. We 
then attempt to determine the dimensions of a container of similar design that minimize
construction cost.
1. First locate a trash dumpster in your area. Carefully study and describe all details of its
construction, and determine its volume. Include a sketch of the container.
2. While maintaining the general shape and method of construction, determine the dimen-
sions such a container of the same volume should have in order to minimize the cost of
construction. Use the following assumptions in your analysis:
I The sides, back, and front are to be made from 12-gauge (0.1046 inch thick) steel
sheets, which cost $0.70 per square foot (including any required cuts or bends).
I The base is to be made from a 10-gauge (0.1345 inch thick) steel sheet, which costs
$0.90 per square foot.
I Lids cost approximately $50.00 each, regardless of dimensions.
I Welding costs approximately $0.18 per foot for material and labor combined.
Give justiﬁcation of any further assumptions or simpliﬁcations made of the details of 
construction.
3. Describe how any of your assumptions or simpliﬁcations may affect the ﬁnal result.
4. If you were hired as a consultant on this investigation, what would your conclusions be?
Would you recommend altering the design of the dumpster? If so, describe the savings
that would result.

Quadratic Approximations and Critical Points
The Taylor polynomial approximation to functions of one variable that we discussed in
Chapter 8 can be extended to functions of two or more variables. Here we investigate qua-
dratic approximations to functions of two variables and use them to give insight into the
Second Derivatives Test for classifying critical points.
In Section 11.4 we discussed the linearization of a function 
of two variables at a 
point 
:
Recall that the graph of 
is the tangent plane to the surface 
at 
and
the corresponding linear approximation is 
. The linearization 
is also
called the ﬁrst-degree Taylor polynomial of 
at

Taylor polynomial of

is called the quadratic approximation to

In Example 6 in Section 11.7 we maximized a volume function 
subject to the 
constraint 
, which expressed the side condition that the surface
area was 12 m . In this section we present Lagrange’s method for maximizing or min-
imizing a general function 
subject to a constraint (or side condition) of the
form 
.
It is easier to explain the geometric basis of Lagrange’s method for functions of two
variables. So we start by trying to ﬁnd the extreme values of 
subject to a con-
straint of the form 
. In other words, we seek the extreme values of 
when the point 
is restricted to lie on the level curve 
. Figure 1 shows
this curve together with several level curves of . These have the equations
where
,
,
,
,
. To maximize 
subject to 
is to ﬁnd the
largest value of such that the level curve 
intersects 
. It appears
from Figure 1 that this happens when these curves just touch each other, that is, when
they have a common tangent line. (Otherwise, the value of c could be increased fur-
ther.) This means that the normal lines at the point 
where they touch are iden-
tical. So the gradient vectors are parallel; that is,
for some
scalar .
This kind of argument also applies to the problem of ﬁnding the extreme values of
subject to the constraint 
. Thus, the point 
is restricted
to lie on the level surface with equation 
. Instead of the level curves in
Figure 1, we consider the level surfaces 
and argue that if the maximum
value of 
is 
, then the level surface 
is tangent to the
level surface 
and so the corresponding gradient vectors are parallel.
This intuitive argument can be made precise as follows. Suppose that a function 
has an extreme value at a point 
on the surface and let 
be a curve with
vector equation 
that lies on and passes through . If 
is the
parameter value corresponding to the point , then 
. The compos-
ite function 
represents the values that 
takes on the curve .
Since 
has an extreme value at 
, it follows that 
has an extreme value at
, so 
. But if 
is differentiable, we can use the Chain Rule to write
This shows that the gradient vector 
is orthogonal to the tangent vector
to every such curve . But we already know from Section 11.6 that the gradient
vector of ,
, is also orthogonal to 
. (See Equation 11.6.18.) This

means that the gradient vectors 
and 
must be parallel. There-
fore, if 
, there is a number 
such that
The number in Equation 1 is called a Lagrange multiplier. The procedure based
on Equation 1 is as follows.
Method of Lagrange Multipliers To ﬁnd the maximum and minimum values of
subject to the constraint 
(assuming that these extreme 
values exist):
(a) Find all values of , , , and 
such that
and
(b) Evaluate 
at all the points 
that result from step (a). The largest of
these values is the maximum value of ; the smallest is the minimum
value of .
If we write the vector equation 
in terms of its components, then the equa-
tions in step (a) become
This is a system of four equations in the four unknowns , , , and , but it is not neces-
sary to ﬁnd explicit values for .
For functions of two variables the method of Lagrange multipliers is similar to the
method just described. To ﬁnd the extreme values of 
subject to the constraint
, we look for values of , , and 
such that
This amounts to solving three equations in three unknowns:
Our ﬁrst illustration of Lagrange’s method is to reconsider the problem given in
Example 6 in Section 11.7.
EXAMPLE 1 A rectangular box without a lid is to be made from 12 m of cardboard.
Find the maximum volume of such a box.
SOLUTION As in Example 6 in Section 11.7 we let , , and be the length, width, and
height, respectively, of the box in meters. Then we wish to maximize

L Lagrange multipliers are named after
the French-Italian mathematician 
Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736–1813).
See page 281 for a biographical sketch
of Lagrange.

Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, we look for values of , , , and 
such
that 
and 
. This gives the equations
which become
There are no general rules for solving systems of equations. Sometimes some inge-
nuity is required. In the present example you might notice that if we multiply (2) by
(3) by , and (4) by , then the left sides of these equations will be identical.
Doing this, we have
We observe that 
because 
would imply 
from (2), (3),
and (4) and this would contradict (5). Therefore, from (6) and (7) we have
which gives 
. But 
(since 
would give 
), so 
. From (7)
and (8) we have
which gives 
and so (since 
) 
. If we now put 
in
(5), we get
Since , , and are all positive, we therefore have

as
before.

Therefore, the maximum value of

SOLUTION According to the procedure in (11.7.9), we compare the values of 
at the
critical points with values at the points on the boundary. Since 
and 
,
the only critical point is 
. We compare the value of 
at that point with the
extreme values on the boundary from Example 2:
Therefore, the maximum value of

the minimum value is

EXAMPLE 4 Find the points on the sphere 
that are closest to and
farthest from the point 
.
SOLUTION The distance from a point 
to the point 
is
but the algebra is simpler if we instead maximize and minimize the square of the 
distance:
The constraint is that the point 
lies on the sphere, that is,
According to the method of Lagrange multipliers, we solve

gives
The simplest way to solve these equations is to solve for , , and in terms of

It’s easy to see that

Two Constraints
Suppose now that we want to ﬁnd the maximum and minimum values of a function
subject to two constraints (side conditions) of the form 
and
. Geometrically, this means that we are looking for the extreme values of

of the level surfaces
and 
. (See Figure 5.) Suppose

at a point 
. We know from the beginning of this section that

onal to 
there. But we also know that

and 
is
orthogonal to

and 
are both orthogonal to . This means that
the gradient vector 
is in the plane determined by 
and
. (We assume that these gradient vectors are not zero and not parallel.)
So there are numbers 
and 
(called Lagrange multipliers) such that
In this case Lagrange’s method is to look for extreme values by solving ﬁve equations
in the ﬁve unknowns , , ,
, and . These equations are obtained by writing Equa-

Rocket Science
Many rockets, such as the Pegasus XL currently used to launch satellites and the Saturn V
that ﬁrst put men on the Moon, are designed to use three stages in their ascent into space. 
A large ﬁrst stage initially propels the rocket until its fuel is consumed, at which point the
stage is jettisoned to reduce the mass of the rocket. The smaller second and third stages
function similarly in order to place the rocket’s payload into orbit about Earth. (With this
design, at least two stages are required in order to reach the necessary velocities, and using
three stages has proven to be a good compromise between cost and performance.) Our goal
here is to determine the individual masses of the three stages to be designed in such a way
as to minimize the total mass of the rocket while enabling it to reach a desired velocity.
For a single-stage rocket consuming fuel at a constant rate, the change in velocity result-
ing from the acceleration of the rocket vehicle has been modeled by
where 
is the mass of the rocket engine including initial fuel,
is the mass of the pay-
load,
is a structural factor determined by the design of the rocket (speciﬁcally, it is the
ratio of the mass of the rocket vehicle without fuel to the total mass of the rocket with
payload), and is the (constant) speed of exhaust relative to the rocket.
Now consider a rocket with three stages and a payload of mass . We will consider out-
side forces negligible and assume that and 
remain constant for each stage. If 
is the
mass of the 
stage, we can initially consider the rocket engine to have mass 
and its
payload to have mass 
; the second and third stages can be handled similarly.
1. Show that the velocity attained after all three stages have been jettisoned is given by
2. We wish to minimize the total mass 
of the rocket engine subject 
to the constraint that the desired velocity 
from Problem 1 is attained. The method of
Lagrange multipliers is appropriate here, but difﬁcult to implement using the current
expressions. To simplify, we deﬁne variables 
so that the constraint equation may be
expressed as 
. Since 
is now difﬁcult to express in terms
of the 
’s, we wish to use a simpler function that will be minimized at the same place.

Hydro-Turbine Optimization
The Great Northern Paper Company in Millinocket, Maine, operates a hydroelectric gener-
ating station on the Penobscot River. Water is piped from a dam to the power station. The
rate at which the water ﬂows through the pipe varies, depending on external conditions.
The power station has three different hydroelectric turbines, each with a known (and
unique) power function that gives the amount of electric power generated as a function of
the water ﬂow arriving at the turbine. The incoming water can be apportioned in different
volumes to each turbine, so the goal is to determine how to distribute water among the
turbines to give the maximum total energy production for any rate of ﬂow.
Using experimental evidence and Bernoulli’s equation, the following quadratic models
were determined for the power output of each turbine, along with the allowable ﬂows of
operation:
,
,
where
1. If all three turbines are being used, we wish to determine the ﬂow 
to each turbine that
will give the maximum total energy production. Our limitations are that the ﬂows must

sum to the total incoming ﬂow and the given domain restrictions must be observed.
Consequently, use Lagrange multipliers to ﬁnd the values for the individual ﬂows (as
functions of 
) that maximize the total energy production 
subject
to the constraints 
and the domain restrictions on each 
.
2. For which values of 
is your result valid?
3. For an incoming ﬂow of 
, determine the distribution to the turbines and verify
(by trying some nearby distributions) that your result is indeed a maximum.
4. Until now we assumed that all three turbines are operating; is it possible in some situa-
tions that more power could be produced by using only one turbine? Make a graph of
the three power functions and use it to help decide if an incoming ﬂow of 
should be distributed to all three turbines or routed to just one. (If you determine that
only one turbine should be used, which one?) What if the ﬂow is only 
?
5. Perhaps for some ﬂow levels it would be advantageous to use two turbines. If the
incoming ﬂow is 
, which two turbines would you recommend using? Use
Lagrange multipliers to determine how the ﬂow should be distributed between the two
turbines to maximize the energy produced. For this ﬂow, is using two turbines more
efﬁcient than using all three?
6. If the incoming ﬂow is 
, what would you recommend to the company?

In much the same way that our attempt to solve the area problem led to the deﬁnition
of a deﬁnite integral, we now seek to ﬁnd the volume of a solid and in the process we
arrive at the deﬁnition of a double integral.
Review of the Definite Integral
First let’s recall the basic facts concerning deﬁnite integrals of functions of a single
variable. If 
is deﬁned for 
, we start by dividing the interval 
into
n subintervals 
of equal width 
and we choose sample points
in these subintervals. Then we form the Riemann sum
and take the limit of such sums as 
to obtain the deﬁnite integral of 
from 
to :
In the special case where 
, the Riemann sum can be interpreted as the sum of
the areas of the approximating rectangles in Figure 1, and 
represents the
area under the curve 
from 
to .

In this chapter we extend the idea of a deﬁnite integral
to double and triple integrals of functions of two or
three variables. These ideas are then used to compute
volumes, surface areas, masses, and centroids of more
general regions than we were able to consider in
Chapter 6. We also use double integrals to calcu-
late probabilities when two random variables are
involved.

Volumes and Double Integrals
In a similar manner we consider a function of two variables deﬁned on a closed rect-
angle
and we ﬁrst suppose that
. The graph of f is a surface with equation
. Let S be the solid that lies above R and under the graph of f, that is,
(See Figure 2.) Our goal is to ﬁnd the volume of S.
The ﬁrst step is to divide the rectangle 
into subrectangles. We do this by divid-
ing the interval 
into m subintervals 
of equal width 
and dividing 
into n subintervals 
of equal width 
. By
drawing lines parallel to the coordinate axes through the endpoints of these subinter-
vals as in Figure 3, we form the subrectangles
each with area 
.
If we choose a sample point
in each 
, then we can approximate the part
of S that lies above each 
by a thin rectangular box (or “column”) with base 
and
height 
as shown in Figure 4. (Compare with Figure 1.) The volume of this
box is the height of the box times the area of the base rectangle:
If we follow this procedure for all the rectangles and add the volumes of the corre-
sponding boxes, we get an approximation to the total volume of S:
(See Figure 5.) This double sum means that for each subrectangle we evaluate at the
chosen point and multiply by the area of the subrectangle, and then we add the results.

Our intuition tells us that the approximation given in (3) becomes better as m and
n become larger and so we would expect that
We use the expression in Equation 4 to deﬁne the volume of the solid that lies under
the graph of 
and above the rectangle . (It can be shown that this deﬁnition is con-
sistent with our formula for volume in Section 6.2.)
Limits of the type that appear in Equation 4 occur frequently, not just in ﬁnding
volumes but in a variety of other situations as well—as we will see in Section 12.5—
even when 
is not a positive function. So we make the following deﬁnition.
Definition The double integral of 
over the rectangle 
is
if this limit exists.
It can be proved that the limit in Deﬁnition 5 exists if 
is a continuous function.
(It also exists for some discontinuous functions as long as they are reasonably “well
behaved.”)
The sample point 
can be chosen to be any point in the subrectangle 
but if we choose it to be the upper right-hand corner of 
[namely 
, see Fig-
ure 3], then the expression for the double integral looks simpler:
By comparing Deﬁnitions 4 and 5, we see that a volume can be written as a double
integral:

The sum in Deﬁnition 5,
is called a double Riemann sum and is used as an approximation to the value of the 
double integral. [Notice how similar it is to the Riemann sum in (1) for a function of
a single variable.] If happens to be a positive function, then the double Riemann sum 
represents the sum of volumes of columns, as in Figure 5, and is an approximation to
the volume under the graph of .

SOLUTION The squares are shown in Figure 6. The paraboloid is the graph of
and the area of each square is 1. Approximating the

This is the volume of the approximating rectangular boxes shown in Figure 7.

ber of squares. Figure 8 shows how the columns start to look more like the actual solid

256 squares. In the next section we will be able to show that the exact volume is 48.

but, because 
, we can compute the integral by interpreting it as a vol-
ume. If

represents the volume of the solid S that lies below the circular cylinder 
and above the rectangle R. (See Figure 9.) The volume of S is the area of a semicircle
with radius 1 times the length of the cylinder. Thus
The Midpoint Rule
The methods that we used for approximating single integrals (the Midpoint Rule, the
Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson’s Rule) all have counterparts for double integrals. Here we
consider only the Midpoint Rule for double integrals. This means that we use a double
Riemann sum to approximate the double integral, where the sample point 
in
is chosen to be the center 
of 
. In other words,
is the midpoint of

NOTE
G In the next section we will develop an efﬁcient method for computing 
double integrals and then we will see that the exact value of the double integral in
Example 3 is 
. (Remember that the interpretation of a double integral as a volume
is valid only when the integrand 
is a positive function. The integrand in Example 3
is not a positive function, so its integral is not a volume. In Examples 2 and 3 in
Section 12.2 we will discuss how to interpret integrals of functions that are not always
positive in terms of volumes.) If we keep dividing each subrectangle in Figure 10 into
four smaller ones with similar shape, we get the Midpoint Rule approximations dis-
played in the chart in the margin. Notice how these approximations approach the exact
value of the double integral,
.

Recall from Section 6.4 that the average value of a function 
of one variable deﬁned
on an interval

of two variables

Recall that it is usually difﬁcult to evaluate single integrals directly from the deﬁnition
of an integral, but the Evaluation Theorem (Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus) provides a much easier method. The evaluation of double integrals from ﬁrst
principles is even more difﬁcult, but in this section we see how to express a double
integral as an iterated integral, which can then be evaluated by calculating two single
integrals.
Suppose that 
is a function of two variables that is continuous on the rectangle
. We use the notation 
to mean that is held ﬁxed and
is integrated with respect to 
from 
to 
. This procedure is called
partial integration with respect to . (Notice its similarity to partial differentiation.)
Now 
is a number that depends on the value of , so it deﬁnes a function
of :
If we now integrate the function 
with respect to from 
to 
, we get
The integral on the right side of Equation 1 is called an iterated integral. Usually the
brackets are omitted. Thus
means that we ﬁrst integrate with respect to 
from to 
and then with respect to 
from 
to .
Similarly, the iterated integral
means that we ﬁrst integrate with respect to 
(holding 
ﬁxed) from 
to 
and then we integrate the resulting function of with respect to from 
to 
Notice that in both Equations 2 and 3 we work from the inside out.

Thus, the function 
in the preceding discussion is given by 
in this
example. We now integrate this function of from 0 to 3:
(b) Here we ﬁrst integrate with respect to :
Notice that in Example 1 we obtained the same answer whether we integrated with
respect to or ﬁrst. In general, it turns out (see Theorem 4) that the two iterated inte-
grals in Equations 2 and 3 are always equal; that is, the order of integration does not
matter. (This is similar to Clairaut’s Theorem on the equality of the mixed partial
derivatives.)
The following theorem gives a practical method for evaluating a double integral by
expressing it as an iterated integral (in either order).
Fubini’s Theorem If 
is continuous on the rectangle 
,
, then
More generally, this is true if we assume that 
is bounded on ,
is discon-
tinuous only on a ﬁnite number of smooth curves, and the iterated integrals
exist.
The proof of Fubini’s Theorem is too difﬁcult to include in this book, but we can
at least give an intuitive indication of why it is true for the case where 
.
Recall that if 
is positive, then we can interpret the double integral 
as
the volume 
of the solid 
that lies above 
and under the surface 
. But
we have another formula that we used for volume in Chapter 6, namely,
where 
is the area of a cross-section of 
in the plane through perpendicular to
the -axis. From Figure 1 you can see that 
is the area under the curve 
whose
equation is 
, where is held constant and 
. Therefore

Augustin-Louis Cauchy almost a century
earlier.

Example 2; nothing is wrong with that.
The function 
in that example is not a
positive function, so its integral doesn’t
represent a volume. From Figure 3 we
see that

the value of the integral is the negative
of the volume that lies above the graph

SOLUTION We ﬁrst observe that 
is the solid that lies under the surface
and above the square

solid was considered in Example 1 in Section 12.1, but we are now in a position to
evaluate the double integral using Fubini’s Theorem. Therefore
In the special case where 
can be factored as the product of a function of 
only and a function of only, the double integral of 
can be written in a particularly
simple form. To be speciﬁc, suppose that

L In Example 2, Solutions 1 and 2 are
equally straightforward, but in Example 3
the ﬁrst solution is much easier than the
second one. Therefore, when we eval-
uate double integrals it is wise to choose
the order of integration that gives simpler
integrals.

Double Integrals over General Regions

For single integrals, the region over which we integrate is always an interval. But for 
double integrals, we want to be able to integrate a function 
not just over rectangles
but also over regions 
of more general shape, such as the one illustrated in Figure 1.
We suppose that 
is a bounded region, which means that 
can be enclosed in a rec-
tangular region 
as in Figure 2. Then we deﬁne a new function 
with domain

CHAPTER 12 MULTIPLE INTEGRALS

If the double integral of F exists over R, then we deﬁne the double integral of
over 
D by
Deﬁnition 2 makes sense because R is a rectangle and so 
has been
previously deﬁned in Section 12.1. The procedure that we have used is reasonable
because the values of 
are 0 when 
lies outside 
and so they contribute
nothing to the integral. This means that it doesn’t matter what rectangle 
we use as
long as it contains .
In the case where 
we can still interpret 
as the volume of
the solid that lies above 
and under the surface 
(the graph of ). You can
see that this is reasonable by comparing the graphs of 
and 
in Figures 3 and 4 and
remembering that 
is the volume under the graph of .
Figure 4 also shows that 
is likely to have discontinuities at the boundary points
of 
. Nonetheless, if 
is continuous on 
and the boundary curve of 
is “well
behaved” (in a sense outside the scope of this book), then it can be shown that
exists and therefore 
exists. In particular, this is the case for
the following types of regions.
A plane region 
is said to be of type I if it lies between the graphs of two con-
tinuous functions of , that is,
where 
and 
are continuous on 
. Some examples of type I regions are shown
in Figure 5.
In order to evaluate 
when 
is a region of type I, we choose a rect-
angle 
that contains , as in Figure 6, and we let 
be the function
given by Equation 1; that is,
agrees with 
on 
and 
is 
outside 
. Then, by
Fubini’s Theorem,
Observe that 
if 
or 
because 
then lies outside .

mula that enables us to evaluate the double integral as an iterated integral.
If 
is continuous on a type I region D such that
then
The integral on the right side of (3) is an iterated integral that is similar to the ones
we considered in the preceding section, except that in the inner integral we regard 
as being constant not only in 
but also in the limits of integration,
and 
We also consider plane regions of type II, which can be expressed as 
where 
and 
are continuous. Two such regions are illustrated in Figure 7.
Using the same methods that were used in establishing (3), we can show that
where D is a type II region given by Equation 4.
EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate 
, where 
is the region bounded by the 
parabolas 
and

SOLUTION The parabolas intersect when 
, that is,
, so 
. 
We note that the region , sketched in Figure 8, is a type I region but not a type II
region and we can write
Since the lower boundary is

NOTE
G When we set up a double integral as in Example 1, it is essential to draw a 
diagram. Often it is helpful to draw a vertical arrow as in Figure 8. Then the limits of 
integration for the inner integral can be read from the diagram as follows: The arrow 
starts at the lower boundary 
, which gives the lower limit in the integral, and 
the arrow ends at the upper boundary 
, which gives the upper limit of inte-
gration. For a type II region the arrow is drawn horizontally from the left boundary to
the right boundary.
EXAMPLE 2 Find the volume of the solid that lies under the paraboloid 
and above the region 
in the 
-plane bounded by the line 
and the parabola

SOLUTION 1 From Figure 9 we see that 
is a type I region and
Therefore, the volume under

is
SOLUTION 2 From Figure 10 we see that 
can also be written as a type II region:
Therefore, another expression for

EXAMPLE 3 Evaluate 
where 
is the region bounded by the line 
and the parabola 
.
SOLUTION The region 
is shown in Figure 12. Again 
is both type I and type II,
but the description of 
as a type I region is more complicated because the lower
boundary consists of two parts. Therefore, we prefer to express 
as a type II
region:
Then (5) gives
If we had expressed 
as a type I region using Figure 12(a), then we would have
obtained
but this would have involved more work than the other method.
EXAMPLE 4 Find the volume of the tetrahedron bounded by the planes

SOLUTION In a question such as this, it’s wise to draw two diagrams: one of the three-
dimensional solid and another of the plane region 
over which it lies. Figure 13
shows the tetrahedron 
bounded by the coordinate planes 
,
, the vertical
plane 
, and the plane 
. Since the plane 
inter-
sects the

) in the line

lies above the triangular region 
in the 
-plane bounded by the lines

, and 
. (See Figure 14.)
The plane 
can be written as 
, so the required
volume lies under the graph of the function 
and above
Therefore
EXAMPLE 5 Evaluate the iterated integral 
.
SOLUTION If we try to evaluate the integral as it stands, we are faced with the task 
of ﬁrst evaluating 
. But it’s impossible to do so in ﬁnite terms since
is not an elementary function. (See the end of Section 5.8.) So we must
change the order of integration. This is accomplished by ﬁrst expressing the given
iterated integral as a double integral. Using (3) backward, we have
where
We sketch this region 
in Figure 15. Then from Figure 16 we see that an alterna-
tive description of 
is
This enables us to use (5) to express the double integral as an iterated integral in the
reverse order:
Properties of Double Integrals
We assume that all of the following integrals exist. The ﬁrst three properties of double
integrals over a region 
follow immediately from Deﬁnition 2 and Properties 7, 8,

The next property of double integrals is similar to the property of single integrals
given by the equation 
.
If 
, where 
and 
don’t overlap except perhaps on their bound-
aries (see Figure 17), then
Property 9 can be used to evaluate double integrals over regions 
that are neither
type I nor type II but can be expressed as a union of regions of type I or type II. Fig-
ure 18 illustrates this procedure. (See Exercises 41 and 42.)
The next property of integrals says that if we integrate the constant function
over a region , we get the area of 
:
Figure 19 illustrates why Equation 10 is true: A solid cylinder whose base is 
and
whose height is 1 has volume 
, but we know that we can also write
its volume as 
.
Finally, we can combine Properties 7, 8, and 10 to prove the following property.

CHAPTER 12 MULTIPLE INTEGRALS

Suppose that we want to evaluate a double integral 
, where 
is one of
the regions shown in Figure 1. In either case the description of 
in terms of rectan-
gular coordinates is rather complicated but is easily described using polar coordinates.
Recall from Figure 2 that the polar coordinates 
of a point are related to the rec-
tangular coordinates 
by the equations
The regions in Figure 1 are special cases of a polar rectangle
which is shown in Figure 3. In order to compute the double integral 
,
where 
is a polar rectangle, we divide the interval 
into 
subintervals 
of equal width 
and we divide the interval 
into 
subintervals
of equal width 
. Then the circles 
and the rays 
divide the polar rectangle R into the small polar rectangles shown in Figure 4.

CHAPTER 12 MULTIPLE INTEGRALS

The formula in (2) says that we convert from rectangular to polar coordinates in a 
double integral by writing 
and 
, using the appropriate limits of 
| integration for and , and replacing 
by 
. Be careful not to forget the addi-
tional factor r on the right side of Formula 2. A classical method for remembering this
is shown in Figure 5, where the “inﬁnitesimal” polar rectangle can be thought of as an
ordinary rectangle with dimensions 
and 
and therefore has “area”
EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate 
, where 
is the region in the upper half-plane
bounded by the circles 
and 
.
SOLUTION The region 
can be described as
It is the half-ring shown in Figure 1(b), and in polar coordinates it is given by
,
. Therefore, by Formula 2,
EXAMPLE 2 Find the volume of the solid bounded by the plane 
and the parabo-
loid 
.
SOLUTION If we put 
in the equation of the paraboloid, we get 
. This
means that the plane intersects the paraboloid in the circle 
, so the solid
lies under the paraboloid and above the circular disk 
given by 
[see
Figures 6 and 1(a)]. In polar coordinates 
is given by 
,
.
Since 
, the volume is
If we had used rectangular coordinates instead of polar coordinates, then we would
have obtained
which is not easy to evaluate because it involves ﬁnding the following integrals:

What we have done so far can be extended to the more complicated type of region
shown in Figure 7. It’s similar to the type II rectangular regions considered in Sec-
tion 12.3. In fact, by combining Formula 2 in this section with Formula 12.3.5, we
obtain the following formula.
If

We have already seen one application of double integrals: computing volumes.
Another geometric application is ﬁnding areas of surfaces and this will be done in the
next section. In this section we explore physical applications such as computing mass,
electric charge, center of mass, and moment of inertia. We will see that these physical
ideas are also important when applied to probability density functions of two random
variables.
Density and Mass
In Chapter 6 we were able to use single integrals to compute moments and the center
of mass of a thin plate or lamina with constant density. But now, equipped with the
double integral, we can consider a lamina with variable density. Suppose the lamina
occupies a region 
of the 
-plane and its density (in units of mass per unit area) at 
xy
D
12.5

a point 
in 
is given by 
, where 
is a continuous function on 
. This
means that
where 
and 
are the mass and area of a small rectangle that contains 
and
the limit is taken as the dimensions of the rectangle approach 0. (See Figure 1.)
To ﬁnd the total mass 
of the lamina we divide a rectangle 
containing 
into
subrectangles 
of the same size (as in Figure 2) and consider 
to be 0 outside
. If we choose a point 
in 
, then the mass of the part of the lamina that
occupies 
is approximately 
, where 
is the area of 
. If we add all
such masses, we get an approximation to the total mass:
If we now increase the number of subrectangles, we obtain the total mass 
of the
lamina as the limiting value of the approximations:
Physicists also consider other types of density that can be treated in the same man-
ner. For example, if an electric charge is distributed over a region 
and the charge
density (in units of charge per unit area) is given by 
at a point 
in , then
the total charge 
is given by
EXAMPLE 1 Charge is distributed over the triangular region 
in Figure 3 so that the
charge density at 
is 
, measured in coulombs per square meter
(Cm ). Find the total charge.
SOLUTION From Equation 2 and Figure 3 we have
Thus, the total charge is
C.
Moments and Centers of Mass
In Section 6.5 we found the center of mass of a lamina with constant density; here we
consider a lamina with variable density. Suppose the lamina occupies a region 
and
has density function 
. Recall from Chapter 6 that we deﬁned the moment of a

particle about an axis as the product of its mass and its directed distance from the axis.
We divide 
into small rectangles as in Figure 2. Then the mass of 
is approximately
, so we can approximate the moment of 
with respect to the -axis by
If we now add these quantities and take the limit as the number of subrectangles be-
comes large, we obtain the moment of the entire lamina about the x-axis:
Similarly, the moment about the y-axis is 
As before, we deﬁne the center of mass 
so that 
and 
. The
physical signiﬁcance is that the lamina behaves as if its entire mass is concentrated at
its center of mass. Thus, the lamina balances horizontally when supported at its cen-
ter of mass (see Figure 4).

of the center of mass of a lamina occupying the
region

Then the formulas in (5) give
The center of mass is at the point 
.
EXAMPLE 3 The density at any point on a semicircular lamina is proportional to the
distance from the center of the circle. Find the center of mass of the lamina.
SOLUTION Let’s place the lamina as the upper half of the circle 
(see Fig-
ure 6). Then the distance from a point 
to the center of the circle (the origin) is
. Therefore, the density function is
where 
is some constant. Both the density function and the shape of the lamina
suggest that we convert to polar coordinates. Then 
and the region 
is given by 
,
. Thus, the mass of the lamina is
Both the lamina and the density function are symmetric with respect to the -axis, so
the center of mass must lie on the -axis, that is,
. The -coordinate is given by
Therefore, the center of mass is located at the point 
.

Moment of Inertia
The moment of inertia (also called the second moment) of a particle of mass 
about an axis is deﬁned to be 
, where is the distance from the particle to the axis.
We extend this concept to a lamina with density function 
and occupying a
region 
by proceeding as we did for ordinary moments. We divide 
into small rect-
angles, approximate the moment of inertia of each subrectangle about the -axis, and
take the limit of the sum as the number of subrectangles becomes large. The result is
the moment of inertia of the lamina about the x-axis:
Similarly, the moment of inertia about the y-axis is
It is also of interest to consider the moment of inertia about the origin, also called
the polar moment of inertia:
Note that

so the moment of inertia of the disk about the origin (like a wheel about its axle) can
be written as
Thus, if we increase the mass or the radius of the disk, we thereby increase the mo-
ment of inertia. In general, the moment of inertia plays much the same role in rota-
tional motion that mass plays in linear motion. The moment of inertia of a wheel is
what makes it difﬁcult to start or stop the rotation of the wheel, just as the mass of a
car is what makes it difﬁcult to start or stop the motion of the car.
Probability
In Section 6.7 we considered the probability density function 
of a continuous ran-
dom variable X. This means that 
for all x,
, and the proba-
bility that X lies between a and b is found by integrating f from a to b:
Now we consider a pair of continuous random variables X and Y, such as the life-
times of two components of a machine or the height and weight of an adult female
chosen at random. The joint density function of X and Y is a function f of two vari-
ables such that the probability that 
lies in a region D is
In particular, if the region is a rectangle, the probability that X lies between a and b
and Y lies between c and d is
(See Figure 7.)
The probability that X lies between a and b and Y lies between c and d is the volume that lies
above the rectangle D=[a, b]x[c, d] and below the graph of the joint density function.

Because probabilities aren’t negative and are measured on a scale from 0 to 1, the
joint density function has the following properties:
As in Exercise 32 in Section 12.4, the double integral over 
is an improper integral
deﬁned as the limit of double integrals over expanding circles or squares and we can
write
EXAMPLE 5 If the joint density function for X and Y is given by
ﬁnd the value of the constant C. Then ﬁnd 
.
SOLUTION We ﬁnd the value of C by ensuring that the double integral of f is equal 
to 1. Because 
outside the rectangle 
, we have
Therefore,
and so 
.
Now we can compute the probability that X is at most 7 and Y is at least 2:
Suppose X is a random variable with probability density function 
and Y is a
random variable with density function 
. Then X and Y are called independent
random variables if their joint density function is the product of their individual den-
sity functions:
In Section 6.7 we modeled waiting times by using exponential density functions 
where 
is the mean waiting time. In the next example we consider a situation with
two independent waiting times.

CHAPTER 12 MULTIPLE INTEGRALS

EXAMPLE 6 The manager of a movie theater determines that the average time movie-
goers wait in line to buy a ticket for this week’s ﬁlm is 10 minutes and the average
time they wait to buy popcorn is 5 minutes. Assuming that the waiting times are
independent, ﬁnd the probability that a moviegoer waits a total of less than 20 min-
utes before taking his or her seat.
SOLUTION Assuming that both the waiting time X for the ticket purchase and the wait-
ing time Y in the refreshment line are modeled by exponential probability density
functions, we can write the individual density functions as
Since X and Y are independent, the joint density function is the product:
We are asked for the probability that 
:
where D is the triangular region shown in Figure 8. Thus
This means that about 75% of the moviegoers wait less than 20 minutes before
taking their seats.
Expected Values
Recall from Section 6.7 that if X is a random variable with probability density func-
tion
, then its mean is
Now if X and Y are random variables with joint density function f, we deﬁne the 
X-mean and Y-mean, also called the expected values of X and Y, to be

Notice how closely the expressions for 
and 
in (9) resemble the moments 
and
of a lamina with density function 
in Equations 3 and 4. In fact, we can think of
probability as being like continuously distributed mass. We calculate probability the
way we calculate mass—by integrating a density function. And because the total
“probability mass” is 1, the expressions for 
and 
in (5) show that we can think of
the expected values of X and Y,
and 
, as the coordinates of the “center of mass”
of the probability distribution.
In the next example we deal with normal distributions. As in Section 6.7, a single
random variable is normally distributed if its probability density function is of the
form
where 
is the mean and 
is the standard deviation.
EXAMPLE 7 A factory produces (cylindrically shaped) roller bearings that are sold as
having diameter 4.0 cm and length 6.0 cm. In fact, the diameters X are normally
distributed with mean 4.0 cm and standard deviation 0.01 cm while the lengths Y are
normally distributed with mean 6.0 cm and standard deviation 0.01 cm. Assuming
that X and Y are independent, write the joint density function and graph it. Find the
probability that a bearing randomly chosen from the production line has either
length or diameter that differs from the mean by more than 0.02 cm.
SOLUTION We are given that X and Y are normally distributed with 
,
and 
. So the individual density functions for X and Y are
Since X and Y are independent, the joint density function is the product:
A graph of this function is shown in Figure 9.
Let’s ﬁrst calculate the probability that both X and Y differ from their means by
less than 0.02 cm. Using a calculator or computer to estimate the integral, we have
Then the probability that either X or Y differs from its mean by more than 0.02 cm is
approximately

In this section we apply double integrals to the problem of computing the area of a
surface. We start by ﬁnding a formula for the area of a parametric surface and then, as
a special case, we deduce a formula for the surface area of the graph of a function of
two variables.
We recall from Section 10.5 that a parametric surface 
is deﬁned by a vector-
valued function of two parameters
or, equivalently, by parametric equations
where 
varies throughout a region 
in the 
-plane.
We will ﬁnd the area of by dividing into patches and approximating the area of
each patch by the area of a piece of a tangent plane. So ﬁrst let’s recall from Sec-
tion 11.4 how to ﬁnd tangent planes to parametric surfaces.
Let 
be a point on 
with position vector 
. If we keep constant by put-
ting 
, then 
becomes a vector function of the single parameter 
and
deﬁnes a grid curve 
lying on . (See Figure 1.) The tangent vector to 
at 
is
obtained by taking the partial derivative of with respect to :
Similarly, if we keep 
constant by putting 
, we get a grid curve 
given by
that lies on , and its tangent vector at 
is

exists and can be found using the
normal vector.
Now we deﬁne the surface area of a general parametric surface given by Equation 1.
For simplicity we start by considering a surface whose parameter domain 
is a rect-
angle, and we divide it into subrectangles 
. Let’s choose 
to be the lower left
corner of 
. (See Figure 2.) The part 
of the surface that corresponds to 
is called
a patch and has the point 
with position vector 
as one of its corners. Let
be the tangent vectors at 
as given by Equations 3 and 2.
Figure 3(a) shows how the two edges of the patch that meet at 
can be approxi-
mated by vectors. These vectors, in turn, can be approximated by the vectors 
and 
because partial derivatives can be approximated by difference quotients. So
we approximate 
by the parallelogram determined by the vectors 
and 
.
This parallelogram is shown in Figure 3(b) and lies in the tangent plane to at 
The
area of this parallelogram is
and so an approximation to the area of 
is
Our intuition tells us that this approximation gets better as we increase the number of
subrectangles, and we recognize the double sum as a Riemann sum for the double
integral 
. This motivates the following deﬁnition.
Definition If a smooth parametric surface 
is given by the equation
and 
is covered just once as 
ranges throughout the parameter domain ,
then the surface area of 
is

Just as we deﬁned single integrals for functions of one variable and double integrals
for functions of two variables, so we can deﬁne triple integrals for functions of three
variables. Let’s ﬁrst deal with the simplest case where is deﬁned on a rectangular box:
The ﬁrst step is to divide B into sub-boxes. We do this by dividing the interval 
into l subintervals 
of equal width 
, dividing 
into m subintervals of
width 
, and dividing 
into n subintervals of width 
. The planes through the
endpoints of these subintervals parallel to the coordinate planes divide the box 
into
sub-boxes
which are shown in Figure 1. Each sub-box has volume 
.
Then we form the triple Riemann sum
where the sample point 
is in 
. By analogy with the deﬁnition of a
double integral (12.1.5), we deﬁne the triple integral as the limit of the triple Riemann
sums in (2).
Definition The triple integral of 
over the box 
is
if this limit exists.
Again, the triple integral always exists if is continuous. We can choose the sample
point to be any point in the sub-box, but if we choose it to be the point 
we
get a simpler-looking expression for the triple integral:
Just as for double integrals, the practical method for evaluating triple integrals is to
express them as iterated integrals as follows.

The iterated integral on the right side of Fubini’s Theorem means that we integrate
ﬁrst with respect to (keeping and ﬁxed), then we integrate with respect to (keep-
ing 
ﬁxed), and ﬁnally we integrate with respect to . There are ﬁve other possible
orders in which we can integrate, all of which give the same value. For instance, if we
integrate with respect to , then , and then , we have
EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate the triple integral 
, where 
is the rectangular box
given by
SOLUTION We could use any of the six possible orders of integration. If we choose to
integrate with respect to , then , and then , we obtain
Now we deﬁne the triple integral over a general bounded region E in three-
dimensional space (a solid) by much the same procedure that we used for double 
integrals (12.3.2). We enclose 
in a box 
of the type given by Equation 1. Then we
deﬁne a function 
so that it agrees with 
on 
but is 0 for points in 
that are out-
side . By deﬁnition,
This integral exists if 
is continuous and the boundary of 
is “reasonably smooth.”
The triple integral has essentially the same properties as the double integral (Proper-
ties 6–9 in Section 12.3).
We restrict our attention to continuous functions 
and to certain simple types of
regions. A solid region 
is said to be of type 1 if it lies between the graphs of two
continuous functions of and , that is,
where 
is the projection of 
onto the 
-plane as shown in Figure 2. Notice that the
upper boundary of the solid 
is the surface with equation 
, while the
lower boundary is the surface 
.
By the same sort of argument that led to (12.3.3), it can be shown that if 
is a 
type 1 region given by Equation 5, then

The meaning of the inner integral on the right side of Equation 6 is that 
and 
are
held ﬁxed, and therefore 
and 
are regarded as constants, while

In particular, if the projection 
of 
onto the

in Figure 3), then
and Equation 6 becomes
If, on the other hand,

SOLUTION When we set up a triple integral it’s wise to draw two diagrams: one of 
the solid region 
(see Figure 5) and one of its projection 
on the 
-plane (see 
Figure 6). The lower boundary of the tetrahedron is the plane 
and the upper 
boundary is the plane 
(or 
), so we use 
and 
in Formula 7. Notice that the planes 
and
intersect in the line 
(or 
) in the 
-plane. So the projec-
tion of 
is the triangular region shown in Figure 6, and we have

A solid region 
is of type 2 if it is of the form
where, this time,
is the projection of 
onto the

surface is

, and we have
Finally, a type 3 region is of the form
where 
is the projection of 
onto the 
-plane,
is the left surface, and
is the right surface (see Figure 8). For this type of region we have
In each of Equations 10 and 11 there may be two possible expressions for the inte-
gral depending on whether 
is a type I or type II plane region (and corresponding to
Equations 7 and 8).
EXAMPLE 3 Evaluate 
, where 
is the region bounded by the parab-
oloid 
and the plane 
.
SOLUTION The solid 
is shown in Figure 9. If we regard it as a type 1 region, then we
need to consider its projection 
onto the 
-plane, which is the parabolic region in
Figure 10. (The trace of 
in the plane 
is the parabola 
.)
From 
we obtain 
, so the lower boundary surface of

Although this expression is correct, it is extremely difﬁcult to evaluate. So let’s
instead consider 
as a type 3 region. As such, its projection 
onto the 
-plane is
the disk 
shown in Figure 11.
Then the left boundary of 
is the paraboloid 
and the right boundary
is the plane 
, so taking 
and 
in Equation 11, we
have
Although this integral could be written as
it’s easier to convert to polar coordinates in the 
-plane:
,
.
This gives
Applications of Triple Integrals
Recall that if 
, then the single integral 
represents the area under the
curve 
from to , and if 
, then the double integral 
represents the volume under the surface 
and above . The corresponding
interpretation of a triple integral 
, where 
, is not very
useful because it would be the “hypervolume” of a four-dimensional object and, of
course, that is very difﬁcult to visualize. (Remember that 
is just the domain of the
function ; the graph of 
lies in four-dimensional space.) Nonetheless, the triple inte-
gral 
can be interpreted in different ways in different physical situa-
tions, depending on the physical interpretations of , ,
and 
.
Let’s begin with the special case where 
for all points in . Then the
triple integral does represent the volume of :
For example, you can see this in the case of a type 1 region by putting 
in Formula 6:

| The most difﬁcult step in evaluating a
triple integral is setting up an expression
for the region of integration (such as
Equation 9 in Example 2). Remember
that the limits of integration in the inner
integral contain at most two variables,
the limits of integration in the middle 
integral contain at most one variable,
and the limits of integration in the outer
integral must be constants.

and from Section 12.3 we know this represents the volume that lies between the sur-
faces 
and 
.
EXAMPLE 4 Use a triple integral to ﬁnd the volume of the tetrahedron 
bounded by
the planes 
,
,
, and 
.
SOLUTION The tetrahedron 
and its projection 
on the 
-plane are shown in 
Figures 12 and 13. The lower boundary of 
is the plane 
and the upper 
boundary is the plane 
, that is,
. Therefore, we have
by the same calculation as in Example 4 in Section 12.3.
(Notice that it is not necessary to use triple integrals to compute volumes. They
simply give an alternative method for setting up the calculation.)
All the applications of double integrals in Section 12.5 can be immediately ex-
tended to triple integrals. For example, if the density function of a solid object that
occupies the region 
is 
, in units of mass per unit volume, at any given point
, then its mass is
and its moments about the three coordinate planes are

We saw in Section 12.4 that some double integrals are easier to evaluate using polar
coordinates. In this section we see that some triple integrals are easier to evaluate
using cylindrical or spherical coordinates.
Cylindrical Coordinates

are
, where
, , and are shown in Figure 1. Suppose that 
is a type 1 region whose projection
on the

ticular, suppose that

In this project we ﬁnd formulas for the volume enclosed by a hypersphere in -dimensional
space.
1. Use a double integral and the trigonometric substitution 
, together with 
Formula 64 in the Table of Integrals, to ﬁnd the area of a circle with radius .
2. Use a triple integral and trigonometric substitution to ﬁnd the volume of a sphere with 
radius .
3. Use a quadruple integral to ﬁnd the hypervolume enclosed by the hypersphere

formulas for

4. Use an -tuple integral to ﬁnd the volume enclosed by a hypersphere of radius in

We know from Equation 12.7.6 that
But we also know how to evaluate double integrals in polar coordinates. In fact, com-
bining Equation 1 with Equation 12.4.3, we obtain
Formula 2 is the formula for triple integration in cylindrical coordinates. It says
that we convert a triple integral from rectangular to cylindrical coordinates by writing
,
, leaving as it is, using the appropriate limits of integration
for , , and , and replacing 
by 
. (Figure 3 shows how to remember this.)
It is worthwhile to use this formula when 
is a solid region easily described in cylin-
drical coordinates, and especially when the function 
involves the expression
.
EXAMPLE 1 A solid 
lies within the cylinder 
, below the plane 
,
and above the paraboloid 
. (See Figure 4.) The density at any point
is proportional to its distance from the axis of the cylinder. Find the mass of .
SOLUTION In cylindrical coordinates the cylinder is 
and the paraboloid is
, so we can write
Since the density at 
is proportional to the distance from the -axis, the den-
sity function is
where 
is the proportionality constant. Therefore, from Formula 12.7.13, the mass
of 
is

. The lower sur-
face of 
is the cone 
and its upper surface is the plane

Figure 5.) This region has a much simpler description in cylindrical coordinates:
Therefore, we have
Spherical Coordinates
In Section 9.7 we deﬁned the spherical coordinates 
of a point (see Figure 6)
and we demonstrated the following relationships between rectangular coordinates and
spherical coordinates:
In this coordinate system the counterpart of a rectangular box is a spherical wedge
where 
,
, and 
. Although we deﬁned triple integrals by
dividing solids into small boxes, it can be shown that dividing a solid into small spher-
ical wedges always gives the same result. So we divide 
into smaller spherical wedges
by means of equally spaced spheres 
, half-planes 
, and half-cones
. Figure 7 shows that 
is approximately a rectangular box with dimensions

Thus, an approximation to a typical triple Riemann sum is
But this sum is a Riemann sum for the function
Consequently, the following formula for triple integration in spherical coordinates
is plausible.
where 
is a spherical wedge given by
Formula 4 says that we convert a triple integral from rectangular coordinates to
spherical coordinates by writing
using the appropriate limits of integration, and replacing 
by 
.
This is illustrated in Figure 8.
This formula can be extended to include more general spherical regions such as
In this case the formula is the same as in (4) except that the limits of integration for 
are

.
Usually, spherical coordinates are used in triple integrals when surfaces such as
cones and spheres form the boundary of the region of integration.

SOLUTION Since the boundary of 
is a sphere, we use spherical coordinates:
In addition, spherical coordinates are appropriate because
Thus, (4) gives
NOTE
G It would have been extremely awkward to evaluate the integral in Example 3
without spherical coordinates. In rectangular coordinates the iterated integral would
have been
EXAMPLE 4 Use spherical coordinates to ﬁnd the volume of the solid that lies above
the cone 
and below the sphere 
. (See Figure 9.)
SOLUTION Notice that the sphere passes through the origin and has center 
. We
write the equation of the sphere in spherical coordinates as
The equation of the cone can be written as
This gives

Suppose that a solid ball (a marble), a hollow ball (a squash ball), a solid cylinder (a steel

the bottom ﬁrst? (Make a guess before proceeding.)
To answer this question we consider a ball or cylinder with mass , radius , and moment
of inertia (about the axis of rotation). If the vertical drop is , then the potential energy at
the top is 
. Suppose the object reaches the bottom with velocity and angular velocity
, so

from translation
(moving down the slope) and 
from rotation. If we assume that energy loss from rolling
friction is negligible, then conservation of energy gives

A change of variables can also be useful in double integrals. We have already seen 
one example of this: conversion to polar coordinates. The new variables and 
are
related to the old variables and by the equations
and the change of variables formula (12.4.2) can be written as
where is the region in the 
-plane that corresponds to the region 
in the
-plane.
More generally, we consider a change of variables that is given by a transforma-
tion
from the 
-plane to the 
-plane:
where and are related to 
and by the equations
or, as we sometimes write,
We usually assume that 
is a C transformation, which means that and have con-
tinuous ﬁrst-order partial derivatives.
A transformation 
is really just a function whose domain and range are both sub-
sets of
. If
, then the point
is called the image of the point
. If no two points have the same image,
is called one-to-one. Figure 1 shows
the effect of a transformation 
on a region 
in the 
-plane. 
transforms 
into a
region 
in the 
-plane called the image of S, consisting of the images of all points
in .
If 
is a one-to-one transformation, then it has an inverse transformation
from the 
-plane to the 
-plane and it may be possible to solve Equations 3 for 
and in terms of and :

So we begin by ﬁnding the images of the sides of . The ﬁrst side,
, is given by

,
, and so 
. Thus,
is mapped into the line segment from 
to

in the given equations, we get
Eliminating , we obtain
which is part of a parabola. Similarly,

, whose
image is the parabolic arc
Finally,

whose image is 
,
, that is,
. (Notice that as we move around the square in the counterclockwise 
direction, we also move around the parabolic region in the counterclockwise direc-
tion.) The image of 
is the region 
(shown in Figure 2) bounded by the -axis and
the parabolas given by Equations 4 and 5.

small rectangle 
in the

and
whose dimensions are

We can approximate the image region 
by a parallelogram determined by the
secant vectors
shown in Figure 4. But
and so
Similarly
This means that we can approximate R by a parallelogram determined by the vec-
tors

L The Jacobian is named after the 
German mathematician Carl Gustav
Jacob Jacobi (1804–1851). Although
the French mathematician Cauchy 
ﬁrst used these special determinants
involving partial derivatives, Jacobi 
developed them into a method for 
evaluating multiple integrals.

Next we divide a region 
in the 
-plane into rectangles 
and call their images
in the 
-plane 
. (See Figure 6.) Applying the approximation (8) to each 
we
approximate the double integral of 
over 
as follows:
where the Jacobian is evaluated at 
. Notice that this double sum is a Riemann
sum for the integral
The foregoing argument suggests that the following theorem is true. (A full proof
is given in books on advanced calculus.)
Change of Variables in a Double Integral Suppose that 
is a one-to-one 
transformation whose Jacobian is nonzero and that maps a region 
in the 
-plane onto a region 
in the 
-plane. Suppose that 
is continuous on 
and that 
and 
are type I or type II plane regions. Then
Theorem 9 says that we change from an integral in and to an integral in 
and
by expressing and in terms of 
and and writing
Notice the similarity between Theorem 9 and the one-dimensional formula in Equa-
tion 2. Instead of the derivative 
, we have the absolute value of the Jacobian, that
is,
.
As a ﬁrst illustration of Theorem 9, we show that the formula for integration in
polar coordinates is just a special case. Here the transformation 
from the 
-plane
to the

Thus, Theorem 9 gives
which is the same as Formula 12.4.2.

SOLUTION The region

, where 
is the square 
. Indeed, the reason for making the
change of variables to evaluate the integral is that 
is a much simpler region than .
First we need to compute the Jacobian:
Therefore, by Theorem 9,
NOTE
G Example 2 was not a very difﬁcult problem to solve because we were given
a suitable change of variables. If we are not supplied with a transformation, then the
ﬁrst step is to think of an appropriate change of variables. If 
is difﬁcult to inte-
grate, then the form of 
may suggest a transformation. If the region of integra-
tion 
is awkward, then the transformation should be chosen so that the corresponding
region 
in the 
-plane has a convenient description.

The Jacobian of 
is the following 
determinant:
Under hypotheses similar to those in Theorem 9, we have the following formula for
triple integrals:
EXAMPLE 4 Use Formula 13 to derive the formula for triple integration in spherical
coordinates.
SOLUTION Here the change of variables is given by
We compute the Jacobian as follows:
Since 
, we have 
. Therefore
and Formula 13 gives
which is equivalent to Formula 12.8.4.

The vectors in Figure 1 are air velocity vectors that indicate the wind speed and direc-
tion at points 10 m above the surface elevation in the San Francisco Bay area. We see
at a glance from the largest arrows in part (a) that the greatest wind speeds at that time
occurred as the winds entered the bay across the Golden Gate Bridge. Part (b) shows
the very different wind pattern at a later date. Associated with every point in the air
we can imagine a wind velocity vector. This is an example of a velocity vector ﬁeld.

In this chapter we study the calculus of vector ﬁelds.
(These are functions that assign vectors to points in
space.) In particular we deﬁne line integrals (which
can be used to ﬁnd the work done by a force ﬁeld in
moving an object along a curve). Then we deﬁne sur-
face integrals (which can be used to ﬁnd the rate of
ﬂuid ﬂow across a surface). The connections between
these new types of integrals and the single, double,
and triple integrals that we have already met are 
given by the higher-dimensional versions of the 
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: Green’s Theorem, 
Stokes’ Theorem, and the Divergence Theorem.

Other examples of velocity vector ﬁelds are illustrated in Figure 2: ocean currents
and ﬂow past an airfoil.
Another type of vector ﬁeld, called a force ﬁeld, associates a force vector with each
point in a region. An example is the gravitational force ﬁeld that we will look at in
Example 4.
In general, a vector ﬁeld is a function whose domain is a set of points in 
(or 
)
and whose range is a set of vectors in 
(or 
).
Definition Let 
be a set in 
(a plane region). A vector ﬁeld on 
is a
function 
that assigns to each point 
in 
a two-dimensional vector
.
The best way to picture a vector ﬁeld is to draw the arrow representing the vector
starting at the point 
. Of course, it’s impossible to do this for all points
, but we can gain a reasonable impression of 
by doing it for a few representa-
tive points in 
as in Figure 3. Since 
is a two-dimensional vector, we can write
it in terms of its component functions
and 
as follows:
or, for short,
Notice that 
and 
are scalar functions of two variables and are sometimes called
scalar ﬁelds to distinguish them from vector ﬁelds.
Definition Let 
be a subset of 
. A vector ﬁeld on
is a function 
that assigns to each point 
in 
a three-dimensional vector 
.
A vector ﬁeld on 
is pictured in Figure 4. We can express it in terms of its com-
ponent functions ,
, and

Velocity vector fields

As with the vector functions in Section 10.1, we can deﬁne continuity of vector ﬁelds 
and show that 
is continuous if and only if its component functions ,
, and 
are 
continuous.
We sometimes identify a point 
with its position vector 
and
write 
instead of 
. Then 
becomes a function that assigns a vector 
to a vector .
EXAMPLE 1 A vector ﬁeld on 
is deﬁned by
Describe 
by sketching some of the vectors 
as in Figure 3.
SOLUTION Since 
, we draw the vector 
starting at the point 
in Figure 5. Since 
, we draw the vector 
with starting point
. Continuing in this way, we draw a number of representative vectors to repre-
sent the vector ﬁeld in Figure 5.
It appears that each arrow is tangent to a circle with center the origin. To conﬁrm 
this, we take the dot product of the position vector 
with the vector
:
This shows that 
is perpendicular to the position vector 
and is therefore
tangent to a circle with center the origin and radius 
. Notice also
that
so the magnitude of the vector 
is equal to the radius of the circle.
Some computer algebra systems are capable of plotting vector ﬁelds in two or three
dimensions. They give a better impression of the vector ﬁeld than is possible by hand
because the computer can plot a large number of representative vectors. Figure 6
shows a computer plot of the vector ﬁeld in Example 1; Figures 7 and 8 show two
other vector ﬁelds. Notice that the computer scales the lengths of the vectors so they
are not too long and yet are proportional to their true lengths.

EXAMPLE 2 Sketch the vector ﬁeld on 
given by 
.
SOLUTION The sketch is shown in Figure 9. Notice that all vectors are vertical and
point upward above the 
-plane or downward below it. The magnitude increases
with the distance from the 
-plane.
We were able to draw the vector ﬁeld in Example 2 by hand because of its partic-
ularly simple formula. Most three-dimensional vector ﬁelds, however, are virtually
impossible to sketch by hand and so we need to resort to a computer algebra system.
Examples are shown in Figures 10, 11, and 12. Notice that the vector ﬁelds in Figures
10 and 11 have similar formulas, but all the vectors in Figure 11 point in the general
direction of the negative y-axis because their y-components are all 2. If the vector
ﬁeld in Figure 12 represents a velocity ﬁeld, then a particle would be swept upward
and would spiral around the -axis in the clockwise direction as viewed from above.
EXAMPLE 3 Imagine a ﬂuid ﬂowing steadily along a pipe and let 
be the
velocity vector at a point 
. Then 
assigns a vector to each point 
in a
certain domain 
(the interior of the pipe) and so 
is a vector ﬁeld on 
called a
velocity ﬁeld. A possible velocity ﬁeld is illustrated in Figure 13. The speed at any
given point is indicated by the length of the arrow.
Velocity ﬁelds also occur in other areas of physics. For instance, the vector ﬁeld in
Example 1 could be used as the velocity ﬁeld describing the counterclockwise rota-
tion of a wheel. We have seen other examples of velocity ﬁelds in Figures 1 and 2.
EXAMPLE 4 Newton’s Law of Gravitation states that the magnitude of the gravita-
tional force between two objects with masses 
and 
is
where is the distance between the objects and 
is the gravitational constant. (This 
is an example of an inverse square law.) Let’s assume that the object with mass 
is located at the origin in 
. (For instance,
could be the mass of Earth and the
origin would be at its center.) Let the position vector of the object with mass
be

Therefore, the gravitational force acting on the object at 
is
[Physicists often use the notation instead of 
for the position vector, so you may
see Formula 3 written in the form 
.] The function given by Equa-
tion 3 is an example of a vector ﬁeld, called the gravitational ﬁeld, because it asso-
ciates a vector [the force 
] with every point 
in space.
Formula 3 is a compact way of writing the gravitational ﬁeld, but we can also
write it in terms of its component functions by using the facts that
and 
:
The gravitational ﬁeld 
is pictured in Figure 14.
EXAMPLE 5 Suppose an electric charge 
is located at the origin. According to
Coulomb’s Law, the electric force 
exerted by this charge on a charge 
located 
at a point 
with position vector 
is
where 
is a constant (that depends on the units used). For like charges, we have
and the force is repulsive; for unlike charges, we have 
and the force
is attractive. Notice the similarity between Formulas 3 and 4. Both vector ﬁelds are
examples of force ﬁelds.
Instead of considering the electric force , physicists often consider the force per
unit charge:
Then 
is a vector ﬁeld on 
called the electric ﬁeld of .

EXAMPLE 6 Find the gradient vector ﬁeld of 
. Plot the gradient
vector ﬁeld together with a contour map of f. How are they related?
SOLUTION The gradient vector ﬁeld is given by
Figure 15 shows a contour map of 
with the gradient vector ﬁeld. Notice that the
gradient vectors are perpendicular to the level curves, as we would expect from
Section 11.6. Notice also that the gradient vectors are long where the level curves
are close to each other and short where they are farther apart. That’s because the
length of the gradient vector is the value of the directional derivative of 
and close
level curves indicate a steep graph.
A vector ﬁeld 
is called a conservative vector ﬁeld if it is the gradient of some
scalar function, that is, if there exists a function 
such that 
. In this situation
is called a potential function for .
Not all vector ﬁelds are conservative, but such ﬁelds do arise frequently in physics.
For example, the gravitational ﬁeld F in Example 4 is conservative because if we
deﬁne
then
In Sections 13.3 and 13.5 we will learn how to tell whether or not a given vector ﬁeld
is conservative.

In this section we deﬁne an integral that is similar to a single integral except that
instead of integrating over an interval 
, we integrate over a curve . Such inte-
grals are called line integrals, although “curve integrals” would be better terminology.
They were invented in the early 19th century to solve problems involving ﬂuid ﬂow,
forces, electricity, and magnetism.
We start with a plane curve 
given by the parametric equations
or, equivalently, by the vector equation 
, and we assume that 
is a smooth curve. [This means that 
is continuous and 
. See Section 10.2.]
If we divide the parameter interval 
into n subintervals 
of equal width
and we let 
and 
, then the corresponding points 
divide 
into 
subarcs with lengths 
(See Figure 1.) We choose any point
in the th subarc. (This corresponds to a point 
in 
.) Now if 
is
any function of two variables whose domain includes the curve , we evaluate 
at
the point 
, multiply by the length 
of the subarc, and form the sum
which is similar to a Riemann sum. Then we take the limit of these sums and make
the following deﬁnition by analogy with a single integral.
Definition If 
is deﬁned on a smooth curve 
given by Equations 1, then
the line integral of f along C is
if this limit exists.
In Section 6.3 we found that the length of

33. The ﬂow lines (or streamlines) of a vector ﬁeld are the
paths followed by a particle whose velocity ﬁeld is the
given vector ﬁeld. Thus, the vectors in a vector ﬁeld are
tangent to the ﬂow lines.
(a) Use a sketch of the vector ﬁeld 
to
draw some ﬂow lines. From your sketches, can you
guess the equations of the ﬂow lines?
(b) If parametric equations of a ﬂow line are

ential equations

A similar type of argument can be used to show that if is a continuous function, then
the limit in Deﬁnition 2 always exists and the following formula can be used to eval-
uate the line integral:
The value of the line integral does not depend on the parametrization of the curve, pro-
vided that the curve is traversed exactly once as t increases from a to b.
If 
is the length of C between 
and 
, then
So the way to remember Formula 3 is to express everything in terms of the parameter
Use the parametric equations to express and in terms of and write ds as
In the special case where 
is the line segment that joins 
to 
, using as
the parameter, we can write the parametric equations of 
as follows:
,
,
. Formula 3 then becomes
and so the line integral reduces to an ordinary single integral in this case.
Just as for an ordinary single integral, we can interpret the line integral of a posi-
tive function as an area. In fact, if 
,
represents the area of one
side of the “fence” or “curtain” in Figure 2, whose base is 
and whose height above
the point 
is 
.
EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate 
, where 
is the upper half of the unit circle
.
SOLUTION In order to use Formula 3 we ﬁrst need parametric equations to represent C.
Recall that the unit circle can be parametrized by means of the equations
and the upper half of the circle is described by the parameter interval 
(See Figure 3.) Therefore, Formula 3 gives

Suppose now that 
is a piecewise-smooth curve; that is,
is a union of a ﬁnite
number of smooth curves 
where, as illustrated in Figure 4, the initial
point of 
is the terminal point of 
Then we deﬁne the integral of 
along 
as
the sum of the integrals of 
along each of the smooth pieces of :
EXAMPLE 2 Evaluate 
, where 
consists of the arc 
of the parabola 
from 
to 
followed by the vertical line segment 
from 
to 
.
SOLUTION The curve 
is shown in Figure 5. 
is the graph of a function of , so we
can choose as the parameter and the equations for 
become
Therefore
On 
we choose as the parameter, so the equations of 
are
and
Thus
Any physical interpretation of a line integral 
depends on the physical
interpretation of the function . Suppose that 
represents the linear density at a
point 
of a thin wire shaped like a curve . Then the mass of the part of the wire
from 
to 
in Figure 1 is approximately 
and so the total mass of the
wire is approximately 
. By taking more and more points on the curve,
we obtain the mass
of the wire as the limiting value of these approximations:
[For example, if 
represents the density of a semicircular wire, then
the integral in Example 1 would represent the mass of the wire.] The center of mass
of the wire with density function 
is located at the point 
, where
Other physical interpretations of line integrals will be discussed later in this chapter.

EXAMPLE 3 A wire takes the shape of the semicircle 
,
, and is
thicker near its base than near the top. Find the center of mass of the wire if the
linear density at any point is proportional to its distance from the line 
.
SOLUTION As in Example 1 we use the parametrization 
,
,
, and ﬁnd that 
. The linear density is
where is a constant, and so the mass of the wire is
From Equations 4 we have
By symmetry we see that 
, so the center of mass is
See Figure 6.
Two other line integrals are obtained by replacing 
by either 
or
in Deﬁnition 2. They are called the line integrals of 
along

respect to x and y:
When we want to distinguish the original line integral 
from those in

It frequently happens that line integrals with respect to 
and 
occur together.
When this happens, it’s customary to abbreviate by writing
When we are setting up a line integral, sometimes the most difﬁcult thing is to
think of a parametric representation for a curve whose geometric description is given.
In particular, we often need to parametrize a line segment, so it’s useful to remember
that a vector representation of the line segment that starts at 
and ends at 
is given
by
(See Equation 9.5.1 with 
.)
EXAMPLE 4 Evaluate 
, where (a) 
is the line segment from
to 
and (b) 
is the arc of the parabola 
from
to 
. (See Figure 7.)
SOLUTION
(a) A parametric representation for the line segment is
(Use Equation 8 with 
and 
.) Then 
,
,
and Formula 7 gives
(b) Since the parabola is given as a function of , let’s take as the parameter and
write 
as
Then 
and by Formula 7 we have
Notice that we got different answers in parts (a) and (b) of Example 4 even though
the two curves had the same endpoints. Thus, in general, the value of a line integral
depends not just on the endpoints of the curve but also on the path. (But see Sec-
tion 13.3 for conditions under which the integral is independent of the path.)

Notice also that the answers in Example 4 depend on the direction, or orientation,
of the curve. If 
denotes the line segment from 
to 
, you can verify,
using the parametrization
that
In general, a given parametrization 
,
,
, determines an
orientation of a curve , with the positive direction corresponding to increasing values
of the parameter 
(See Figure 8, where the initial point 
corresponds to the param-
eter value and the terminal point 
corresponds to 
.)
If 
denotes the curve consisting of the same points as 
but with the opposite
orientation (from initial point 
to terminal point 
in Figure 8), then we have
But if we integrate with respect to arc length, the value of the line integral does not
change when we reverse the orientation of the curve:
This is because 
is always positive, whereas 
and 
change sign when we re-
verse the orientation of .
Line Integrals in Space
We now suppose that 
is a smooth space curve given by the parametric equations
or by a vector equation 
. If 
is a function of three vari-
ables that is continuous on some region containing , then we deﬁne the line integral
of
along 
(with respect to arc length) in a manner similar to that for plane curves:
We evaluate it using a formula similar to Formula 3:
Observe that the integrals in both Formulas 3 and 9 can be written in the more com-
pact vector notation

Adding the values of these integrals, we obtain
Line Integrals of Vector Fields
Recall from Section 6.5 that the work done by a variable force 
in moving a 
particle from to along the -axis is 
. Then in Section 9.3 we found
that the work done by a constant force 
in moving an object from a point
to another
point 
in space is 
, where 
l is the displacement vector.
Now suppose that 
is a continuous force ﬁeld on 
, such as
the gravitational ﬁeld of Example 4 in Section 13.1 or the electric force ﬁeld of
Example 5 in Section 13.1. (A force ﬁeld on 
could be regarded as a special case
where 
and 
and 
depend only on 
and .) We wish to compute the work
done by this force in moving a particle along a smooth curve .
We divide 
into subarcs 
with lengths 
by dividing the parameter inter-
val 
into subintervals of equal width. (See Figure 1 for the two-dimensional case
or Figure 11 for the three-dimensional case.) Choose a point 
on the th
subarc corresponding to the parameter value 
. If 
is small, then as the particle
moves from 
to 
along the curve, it proceeds approximately in the direction of
, the unit tangent vector at 
. Thus, the work done by the force 
in moving the
particle from 
to 
is approximately
and the total work done in moving the particle along 
is approximately
where 
is the unit tangent vector at the point 
on . Intuitively, we see
that these approximations ought to become better as 
becomes larger. Therefore, we
deﬁne the work
done by the force ﬁeld 
as the limit of the Riemann sums in (11),
namely,
Equation 12 says that work is the line integral with respect to arc length of the tangen-
tial component of the force.

If the curve

, so using Equation 9 we can rewrite Equation 12 in the form
This integral is often abbreviated as 
and occurs in other areas of physics as
well. Therefore, we make the following deﬁnition for the line integral of any contin-
uous vector ﬁeld.
Definition Let

given by a vector function 
,
. Then the line integral of

When using Deﬁnition 13, remember that

simply by putting

Therefore, the work done is
NOTE
G Even though 
and integrals with respect to arc length
are unchanged when orientation is reversed, it is still true that
since the unit tangent vector 
is replaced by its negative when 
is replaced by C.

Recall from Section 5.4 that Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus can be
written as
where 
is continuous on 
. We also called Equation 1 the Total Change Theorem:
The integral of a rate of change is the total change.
If we think of the gradient vector 
of a function 
of two or three variables as a
sort of derivative of , then the following theorem can be regarded as a version of the
Fundamental Theorem for line integrals.
Theorem Let
be a smooth curve given by the vector function
,
. Let 
be a differentiable function of two or three variables whose
gradient vector 
is continuous on . Then
NOTE
G Theorem 2 says that we can evaluate the line integral of a conservative vec-
tor ﬁeld (the gradient vector ﬁeld of the potential function ) simply by knowing the
value of 
at the endpoints of . In fact, Theorem 2 says that the line integral of 
is the total change in f. If 
is a function of two variables and 
is a plane curve with
initial point 
and terminal point 
, as in Figure 1, then Theorem 2
becomes
If is a function of three variables and 
is a space curve joining the point 
to the point 
, then we have
Let’s prove Theorem 2 for this case.

CHAPTER 13 VECTOR CALCULUS

Proof of Theorem 2 Using Deﬁnition 13.2.13, we have
(by the Chain Rule)
The last step follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Equation 1).
Although we have proved Theorem 2 for smooth curves, it is also true for piecewise-
smooth curves. This can be seen by subdividing 
into a ﬁnite number of smooth
curves and adding the resulting integrals.
EXAMPLE 1 Find the work done by the gravitational ﬁeld
in moving a particle with mass 
from the point 
to the point 
along a piecewise-smooth curve . (See Example 4 in Section 13.1.)
SOLUTION From Section 13.1 we know that 
is a conservative vector ﬁeld and, in
fact,
, where
Therefore, by Theorem 2, the work done is
Independence of Path
Suppose 
and 
are two piecewise-smooth curves (which are called paths) that
have the same initial point 
and terminal point . We know from Example 4 in Sec-
tion 13.2 that, in general,
. But one implication of Theorem 2 is
that
whenever 
is continuous. In other words, the line integral of a conservative vector
ﬁeld depends only on the initial point and terminal point of a curve.
In general, if 
is a continuous vector ﬁeld with domain 
, we say that the line
integral 
is independent of path if 
for any two paths

and 
in 
that have the same initial and terminal points. With this terminology
we can say that line integrals of conservative vector ﬁelds are independent of path.
A curve is called closed if its terminal point coincides with its initial point, that is,
. (See Figure 2.) If 
is independent of path in 
and 
is any
closed path in , we can choose any two points 
and 
on 
and regard 
as being
composed of the path 
from 
to 
followed by the path 
from 
to . (See Fig-
ure 3.) Then
since 
and 
have the same initial and terminal points.
Conversely, if it is true that 
whenever 
is a closed path in , then
we demonstrate independence of path as follows. Take any two paths 
and 
from
to 
in 
and deﬁne 
to be the curve consisting of 
followed by 
. Then
and so 
. Thus, we have proved the following theorem.
Theorem
is independent of path in 
if and only if 
for every closed path 
in .
Since we know that the line integral of any conservative vector ﬁeld 
is inde-
pendent of path, it follows that 
for any closed path. The physical inter-
pretation is that the work done by a conservative force ﬁeld (such as the gravitational
or electric ﬁeld in Section 13.1) as it moves an object around a closed path is 0.
The following theorem says that the only vector ﬁelds that are independent of path
are conservative. It is stated and proved for plane curves, but there is a similar version
for space curves. We assume that 
is open, which means that for every point 
in 
there is a disk with center 
that lies entirely in . (So 
doesn’t contain any of its
boundary points.) In addition, we assume that 
is connected. This means that any
two points in 
can be joined by a path that lies in .
Theorem Suppose 
is a vector ﬁeld that is continuous on an open con-
nected region . If 
is independent of path in , then 
is a conserva-
tive vector ﬁeld on ; that is, there exists a function 
such that 
.
Proof Let 
be a ﬁxed point in . We construct the desired potential function
by deﬁning
for any point 
in . Since 
is independent of path, it does not matter 
which path 
from 
to 
is used to evaluate 
. Since 
is open, there
exists a disk contained in 
with center 
. Choose any point 
in the disk
with 
and let 
consist of any path 
from 
to 
followed by the
horizontal line segment 
from 
to 
. (See Figure 4.) Then

The question remains: How is it possible to determine whether or not a vector ﬁeld 
is conservative? Suppose it is known that

have continuous ﬁrst-order partial derivatives. Then there is a function 
such 
that

Therefore, by Clairaut’s Theorem,

The converse of Theorem 5 is true only for a special type of region. To explain this,
we ﬁrst need the concept of a simple curve, which is a curve that doesn’t intersect
itself anywhere between its endpoints. [See Figure 6; 
for a simple closed
curve, but 
when

In Theorem 4 we needed an open connected region. For the next theorem we need
a stronger condition. A simply-connected region in the plane is a connected region

from Figure 7 that, intuitively speaking, a simply-connected region contains no hole
and can’t consist of two separate pieces.
In terms of simply-connected regions we can now state a partial converse to Theo-
rem 5 that gives a convenient method for verifying that a vector ﬁeld on 
is con-
servative. The proof will be sketched in the next section as a consequence of Green’s
Theorem.
Theorem Let 
be a vector ﬁeld on an open simply-connected
region . Suppose that

Then

SOLUTION Let

. Then
Also, the domain of 
is the entire plane 
, which is open and simply-
connected. Therefore, we can apply Theorem 6 and conclude that 
is conservative.
In Example 3, Theorem 6 told us that 
is conservative, but it did not tell us how
to ﬁnd the (potential) function 
such that 
. The proof of Theorem 4 gives us
a clue as to how to ﬁnd . We use “partial integration” as in the following example.

L Figures 8 and 9 show the vector
ﬁelds in Examples 2 and 3, respec-
tively. The vectors in Figure 8 that start
on the closed curve 
all appear to
point in roughly the same direction as 
. So it looks as if 
and
therefore 
is not conservative. The 
calculation in Example 2 conﬁrms this
impression. Some of the vectors near 
the curves 
and 
in Figure 9 point 
in approximately the same direction as
the curves, whereas others point in the
opposite direction. So it appears plau-
sible that line integrals around all closed
paths are . Example 3 shows that

SOLUTION
(a) From Example 3 we know that 
is conservative and so there exists a function 
with 
, that is,
Integrating (7) with respect to , we obtain
Notice that the constant of integration is a constant with respect to , that is, a func-
tion of , which we have called 
. Next we differentiate both sides of (9) with
respect to :
Comparing (8) and (10), we see that
Integrating with respect to , we have
where 
is a constant. Putting this in (9), we have
as the desired potential function.
(b) To use Theorem 2 all we have to know are the initial and terminal points of ,
namely,
and 
. In the expression for 
in part (a),
any value of the constant 
will do, so let’s choose 
. Then we have
This method is much shorter than the straightforward method for evaluating line
integrals that we learned in Section 13.2.
A criterion for determining whether or not a vector ﬁeld 
on 
is conservative is
given in Section 13.5. Meanwhile, the next example shows that the technique for ﬁnd-
ing the potential function is much the same as for vector ﬁelds on

Conservation of Energy
Let’s apply the ideas of this chapter to a continuous force ﬁeld 
that moves an object
along a path 
given by 
,
, where 
is the initial point and
is the terminal point of . According to Newton’s Second Law of Motion
(see Section 10.4), the force 
at a point on 
is related to the acceleration
by the equation
So the work done by the force on the object is

Therefore
where 
is the velocity.
The quantity 
, that is, half the mass times the square of the speed, is
called the kinetic energy of the object. Therefore, we can rewrite Equation 15 as
which says that the work done by the force ﬁeld along 
is equal to the change in
kinetic energy at the endpoints of .
Now let’s further assume that 
is a conservative force ﬁeld; that is, we can write
. In physics, the potential energy of an object at the point 
is deﬁned
as 
, so we have 
. Then by Theorem 2 we have
Comparing this equation with Equation 16, we see that
which says that if an object moves from one point 
to another point 
under the inﬂu-
ence of a conservative force ﬁeld, then the sum of its potential energy and its kinetic
energy remains constant. This is called the Law of Conservation of Energy and it is
the reason the vector ﬁeld is called conservative.

Green’s Theorem gives the relationship between a line integral around a simple closed
curve 
and a double integral over the plane region 
bounded by . (See Figure 1.
We assume that 
consists of all points inside 
as well as all points on .) In stating
Green’s Theorem we use the convention that the positive orientation of a simple
closed curve 
refers to a single counterclockwise traversal of . Thus, if 
is given
by the vector function 
,
, then the region 
is always on the left as the
point 
traverses . (See Figure 2.)
Green’s Theorem Let 
be a positively oriented, piecewise-smooth, simple
closed curve in the plane and let 
be the region bounded by . If

curve of 
is 
, so the equation in Green’s Theorem can be written as
Green’s Theorem should be regarded as the counterpart of the Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus for double integrals. Compare Equation 1 with the statement of the Funda-
mental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2, in the following equation:
In both cases there is an integral involving derivatives (
,
, and 
) on the
left side of the equation. And in both cases the right side involves the values of the
original functions ( ,
, and ) only on the boundary of the domain. (In the one-
dimensional case, the domain is an interval 
whose boundary consists of just two
points,
and .)
Green’s Theorem is not easy to prove in the generality stated in Theorem 1, but we
can give a proof for the special case where the region is both of type I and of type II
(see Section 12.3). Let’s call such regions simple regions.
Proof of Green’s Theorem for the Case in Which 
Is a Simple Region Notice that Green’s
Theorem will be proved if we can show that
and
We prove Equation 2 by expressing 
as a type I region:
where 
and 
are continuous functions. This enables us to compute the double
integral on the right side of Equation 2 as follows:
where the last step follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
Now we compute the left side of Equation 2 by breaking up 
as the union of the
four curves 
,
,
, and 
shown in Figure 3. On 
we take as the parameter
and write the parametric equations as 
,
,
. Thus
Observe that 
goes from right to left but 
goes from left to right, so we can
write the parametric equations of 
as 
,
,
. Therefore

CHAPTER 13 VECTOR CALCULUS
L Green’s Theorem is named after the
self-taught English scientist George 
Green (1793–1841). He worked full-
time in his father’s bakery from the 
age of nine and taught himself mathe-
matics from library books. In 1828 he
published privately An Essay on the
Application of Mathematical Analysis to
the Theories of Electricity and Magne-
tism, but only 100 copies were printed
and most of those went to his friends.
This pamphlet contained a theorem 
that is equivalent to what we know as
Green’s Theorem, but it didn’t become
widely known at that time. Finally, at
age 40, Green entered Cambridge Uni-
versity as an undergraduate but died 
four years after graduation. In 1846
William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) located 
a copy of Green’s essay, realized its 
signiﬁcance, and had it reprinted. 
Green was the ﬁrst person to try to 
formulate a mathematical theory of 
electricity and magnetism. His work 
was the basis for the subsequent electro-
magnetic theories of Thomson, Stokes,
Rayleigh, and Maxwell.

Hence
Comparing this expression with the one in Equation 4, we see that
Equation 3 can be proved in much the same way by expressing 
as a type II region
(see Exercise 28). Then, by adding Equations 2 and 3, we obtain Green’s Theorem.
EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate 
, where 
is the triangular curve consisting of
the line segments from 
to 
, from 
to 
, and from 
to 
.
SOLUTION Although the given line integral could be evaluated as usual by the methods
of Section 13.2, that would involve setting up three separate integrals along the three
sides of the triangle, so let’s use Green’s Theorem instead. Notice that the region 
enclosed by 
is simple and 
has positive orientation (see Figure 4). If we let
and 
, then we have

SOLUTION The region 
bounded by

polar coordinates after applying Green’s Theorem:

In Examples 1 and 2 we found that the double integral was easier to evaluate than
the line integral. (Try setting up the line integral in Example 2 and you’ll soon be con-
vinced!) But sometimes it’s easier to evaluate the line integral, and Green’s Theorem
is used in the reverse direction. For instance, if it is known that 
on the curve , then Green’s Theorem gives
no matter what values 
and 
assume in the region .
Another application of the reverse direction of Green’s Theorem is in computing
areas. Since the area of 
is 
, we wish to choose 
and 
so that
There are several possibilities:
Then Green’s Theorem gives the following formulas for the area of :
EXAMPLE 3 Find the area enclosed by the ellipse
.
SOLUTION The ellipse has parametric equations 
and 
, where
. Using the third formula in Equation 5, we have
Although we have proved Green’s Theorem only for the case where 
is simple,
we can now extend it to the case where 
is a ﬁnite union of simple regions. For
example, if 
is the region shown in Figure 5, then we can write 
, where
and 
are both simple. The boundary of 
is 
and the boundary of 
is
so, applying Green’s Theorem to

separately, we get

If we add these two equations, the line integrals along 
and 
cancel, so we get
which is Green’s Theorem for 
, since its boundary is 
.
The same sort of argument allows us to establish Green’s Theorem for any ﬁnite
union of simple regions (see Figure 6).
EXAMPLE 4 Evaluate 
, where 
is the boundary of the semiannular
region 
in the upper half-plane between the circles 
and 
.
SOLUTION Notice that although 
is not simple, the -axis divides it into two simple
regions (see Figure 7). In polar coordinates we can write
Therefore, Green’s Theorem gives
Green’s Theorem can be extended to apply to regions with holes, that is, regions
that are not simply-connected. Observe that the boundary 
of the region 
in Fig-
ure 8 consists of two simple closed curves 
and 
. We assume that these boundary
curves are oriented so that the region 
is always on the left as the curve 
is tra-
versed. Thus, the positive direction is counterclockwise for the outer curve 
but
clockwise for the inner curve 
. If we divide 
into two regions 
and 
by means
of the lines shown in Figure 9 and then apply Green’s Theorem to each of 
and 
we get
Since the line integrals along the common boundary lines are in opposite directions,
they cancel and we get
which is Green’s Theorem for the region .
EXAMPLE 5 If 
, show that 
for every
simple closed path that encloses the origin.
SOLUTION Since 
is an arbitrary closed path that encloses the origin, it’s difﬁcult to
compute the given integral directly. So let’s consider a counterclockwise-oriented circle

Therefore
that is,
We now easily compute this last integral using the parametrization given by
,
. Thus
We end this section by using Green’s Theorem to discuss a result that was stated in
the preceding section.
Sketch of Proof of Theorem 13.3.6 We’re assuming that

partial derivatives, and that
If 
is any simple closed path in 
and 
is the region that 
encloses, then Green’s
Theorem gives
A curve that is not simple crosses itself at one or more points and can be broken up
into a number of simple curves. We have shown that the line integrals of 
around
these simple curves are all 0 and, adding these integrals, we see that 
for any closed curve . Therefore,

In this section we deﬁne two operations that can be performed on vector ﬁelds and that
play a basic role in the applications of vector calculus to ﬂuid ﬂow and electricity and
magnetism. Each operation resembles differentiation, but one produces a vector ﬁeld
whereas the other produces a scalar ﬁeld.
Curl
If

and the partial derivatives of ,

all exist, then the curl of

duce the vector differential operator

SOLUTION Using Equation 2, we have
Recall that the gradient of a function of three variables is a vector ﬁeld on 
and
so we can compute its curl. The following theorem says that the curl of a gradient vec-
tor ﬁeld is .
Theorem If

Proof We have
by Clairaut’s Theorem.
Since a conservative vector ﬁeld is one for which

phrased as follows:
If

This gives us a way of verifying that a vector ﬁeld is not conservative.

SOLUTION In Example 1 we showed that
This shows that 
and so, by Theorem 3,
is not conservative.
The converse of Theorem 3 is not true in general, but the following theorem says
the converse is true if 
is deﬁned everywhere. (More generally it is true if the domain
is simply-connected, that is, “has no hole.”) Theorem 4 is the three-dimensional ver-
sion of Theorem 13.3.6. Its proof requires Stokes’ Theorem and is sketched at the end
of Section 13.7.

tive vector ﬁeld.

Then (7) gives 
. Therefore
The reason for the name curl is that the curl vector is associated with rotations. One
connection is explained in Exercise 33. Another occurs when 
represents the veloc-
ity ﬁeld in ﬂuid ﬂow (see Example 3 in Section 13.1). Particles near (x, y, ) in the
ﬂuid tend to rotate about the axis that points in the direction of 
and the
length of this curl vector is a measure of how quickly the particles move around the
axis (see Figure 1). If 
at a point , then the ﬂuid is free from rotations at
and 
is called irrotational at . In other words, there is no whirlpool or eddy at P.
If 
, then a tiny paddle wheel moves with the ﬂuid but doesn’t rotate about
its axis. If 
, the paddle wheel rotates about its axis. We give a more detailed
explanation in Section 13.7 as a consequence of Stokes’ Theorem.
Divergence
If

,
, and 
exist,
then the divergence of 
is the function of three variables deﬁned by
Observe that 
is a vector ﬁeld but 
is a scalar ﬁeld. In terms of the gradient
operator 
, the divergence of 
can be written sym-
bolically as the dot product of 
and :
EXAMPLE 4 If 
, ﬁnd 
.
SOLUTION By the deﬁnition of divergence (Equation 9 or 10) we have
If 
is a vector ﬁeld on

is also a vector ﬁeld on 
. As such, we can
compute its divergence. The next theorem shows that the result is 0.

Proof Using the deﬁnitions of divergence and curl, we have
because the terms cancel in pairs by Clairaut’s Theorem.
EXAMPLE 5 Show that the vector ﬁeld 
can’t be 
written as the curl of another vector ﬁeld, that is,
.
SOLUTION In Example 4 we showed that
and therefore 
. If it were true that 
, then Theorem 11 would
give
which contradicts 
. Therefore,
is not the curl of another vector ﬁeld.
Again, the reason for the name divergence can be understood in the context of ﬂuid
ﬂow. If 
is the velocity of a ﬂuid (or gas), then 
represents the 
net rate of change (with respect to time) of the mass of ﬂuid (or gas) ﬂowing from 
the point 
per unit volume. In other words,
measures the tendency
of the ﬂuid to diverge from the point 
. If 
, then 
is said to be 
incompressible.
Another differential operator occurs when we compute the divergence of a gradi-
ent vector ﬁeld 
. If 
is a function of three variables, we have
and this expression occurs so often that we abbreviate it as 
. The operator
is called the Laplace operator because of its relation to Laplace’s equation
We can also apply the Laplace operator 
to a vector ﬁeld
in terms of its components:

Vector Forms of Green’s Theorem
The curl and divergence operators allow us to rewrite Green’s Theorem in versions
that will be useful in our later work. We suppose that the plane region , its boundary
curve , and the functions 
and 
satisfy the hypotheses of Green’s Theorem. Then
we consider the vector ﬁeld 
. Its line integral is
and, regarding 
as a vector ﬁeld on 
with third component , we have
Therefore
and we can now rewrite the equation in Green’s Theorem in the vector form
Equation 12 expresses the line integral of the tangential component of 
along 
as the double integral of the vertical component of 
over the region 
enclosed
by . We now derive a similar formula involving the normal component of .
If 
is given by the vector equation
then the unit tangent vector (see Section 10.2) is
You can verify that the outward unit normal vector to 
is given by
(See Figure 2.) Then, from Equation 13.2.3, we have

The relationship between surface integrals and surface area is much the same as the
relationship between line integrals and arc length. Suppose 
is a function of three
variables whose domain includes a surface . We will deﬁne the surface integral of 
over 
in such a way that, in the case where 
, the value of the surface
integral is equal to the surface area of . We start with parametric surfaces and then
deal with the special case where 
is the graph of a function of two variables.
Parametric Surfaces
Suppose that a surface 
has a vector equation
We ﬁrst assume that the parameter domain 
is a rectangle and we divide it into sub-
rectangles 
with dimensions 
and 
. Then the surface 
is divided into corre-
sponding patches 
as in Figure 1. We evaluate 
at a point 
in each patch, multiply
by the area 
of the patch, and form the Riemann sum
Then we take the limit as the number of patches increases and deﬁne the surface inte-
gral of f over the surface S as
Notice the analogy with the deﬁnition of a line integral (13.2.2) and also the analogy
with the deﬁnition of a double integral (12.1.5).
To evaluate the surface integral in Equation 1 we approximate the patch area 
by the area of an approximating parallelogram in the tangent plane. In our discussion
of surface area in Section 12.6 we made the approximation
where
are the tangent vectors at a corner of 
. If the components are continuous and 
and
are nonzero and nonparallel in the interior of D, it can be shown from Deﬁnition 1,
even when D is not a rectangle, that

This should be compared with the formula for a line integral:
Observe also that
Formula 2 allows us to compute a surface integral by converting it into a double
integral over the parameter domain 
. When using this formula, remember that
is evaluated by writing 
,
, and 
in the for-
mula for 
.
EXAMPLE 1 Compute the surface integral 
, where 
is the unit sphere
.
SOLUTION As in Example 4 in Section 10.5, we use the parametric representation
that is,
As in Example 1 in Section 12.6, we can compute that
Therefore, by Formula 2,
Surface integrals have applications similar to those for the integrals we have previ-
ously considered. For example, if a thin sheet (say, of aluminum foil) has the shape of
a surface 
and the density (mass per unit area) at the point 
is 
, then
the total mass of the sheet is
and the center of mass is 
, where
Moments of inertia can also be deﬁned as before (see Exercise 35).

Oriented Surfaces
In order to deﬁne surface integrals of vector ﬁelds, we need to rule out nonorientable
surfaces such as the Möbius strip shown in Figure 4. [It is named after the German
geometer August Möbius (1790–1868).] You can construct one for yourself by taking
a long rectangular strip of paper, giving it a half-twist, and taping the short edges
together as in Figure 5. If an ant were to crawl along the Möbius strip starting at a
point , it would end up on the “other side” of the strip (that is, with its upper side
pointing in the opposite direction). Then, if the ant continued to crawl in the same
direction, it would end up back at the same point 
without ever having crossed 
an edge. (If you have constructed a Möbius strip, try drawing a pencil line down the
middle.) Therefore, a Möbius strip really has only one side.
From now on we consider only orientable (two-sided) surfaces. We start with a sur-
face 
that has a tangent plane at every point 
on 
(except at any boundary
point). There are two unit normal vectors 
and 
at 
. (See Figure 6.)

If it is possible to choose a unit normal vector 
at every such point 
so that
varies continuously over , then is called an oriented surface and the given choice
of 
provides 
with an orientation. There are two possible orientations for any ori-
entable surface (see Figure 7).
For a surface 
given as the graph of , we use Equation 3 to associate
with the surface a natural orientation given by the unit normal vector
Since the -component is positive, this gives the upward orientation of the surface.
If 
is a smooth orientable surface given in parametric form by a vector function 
, then it is automatically supplied with the orientation of the unit normal vector
and the opposite orientation is given by 
. For instance, in Example 4 in Sec-
tion 10.5 we found the parametric representation
for the sphere 
. Then in Example 1 in Section 12.6 we found that
and
So the orientation induced by 
is deﬁned by the unit normal vector
Observe that 
points in the same direction as the position vector, that is, outward
from the sphere (see Figure 8). The opposite (inward) orientation would have been
obtained (see Figure 9) if we had reversed the order of the parameters because
.
For a closed surface, that is, a surface that is the boundary of a solid region , the 
convention is that the positive orientation is the one for which the normal vectors
point outward from , and inward-pointing normals give the negative orientation (see
Figures 8 and 9).

Surface Integrals of Vector Fields
Suppose that 
is an oriented surface with unit normal vector , and imagine a ﬂuid
with density 
and velocity ﬁeld 
ﬂowing through . (Think of as an
imaginary surface that doesn’t impede the ﬂuid ﬂow, like a ﬁshing net across a
stream.) Then the rate of ﬂow (mass per unit time) per unit area is 
. If we divide 
into small patches 
, as in Figure 10 (compare with Figure 1), then 
is nearly pla-
nar and so we can approximate the mass of ﬂuid crossing 
in the direction of the
normal 
per unit time by the quantity
where , , and are evaluated at some point on 
. (Recall that the component of the
vector 
in the direction of the unit vector 
is 
.) By summing these quantities
and taking the limit we get, according to Deﬁnition 1, the surface integral of the func-
tion 
over :
and this is interpreted physically as the rate of ﬂow through .
If we write 
, then 
is also a vector ﬁeld on 
and the integral in Equation 7
becomes
A surface integral of this form occurs frequently in physics, even when 
is not 
,
and is called the surface integral (or ﬂux integral) of 
over .
Definition If 
is a continuous vector ﬁeld deﬁned on an oriented surface 
with unit normal vector , then the surface integral of 
over S is
This integral is also called the ﬂux of 
across .
In words, Deﬁnition 8 says that the surface integral of a vector ﬁeld over is equal
to the surface integral of its normal component over 
(as previously deﬁned).
If 
is given by a vector function 
, then 
is given by Equation 6, and from
Deﬁnition 8 and Equation 2 we have
where 
is the parameter domain. Thus, we have

EXAMPLE 4 Find the ﬂux of the vector ﬁeld 
across the
unit sphere 
.
SOLUTION Using the parametric representation
we have
and, from Example 1 in Section 12.6,
Therefore
and, by Formula 9, the ﬂux is
by the same calculation as in Example 1.
If, for instance, the vector ﬁeld in Example 4 is a velocity ﬁeld describing the ﬂow
of a ﬂuid with density 1, then the answer,
, represents the rate of ﬂow through the
unit sphere in units of mass per unit time.
In the case of a surface 
given by a graph 
, we can think of and as
parameters and use Equation 3 to write
Thus, Formula 9 becomes

This formula assumes the upward orientation of ; for a downward orientation we
multiply by

SOLUTION
consists of a parabolic top surface 
and a circular bottom surface 
. (See
Figure 12.) Since 
is a closed surface, we use the convention of positive (outward)
orientation. This means that 
is oriented upward and we can use Equation 10 with
being the projection of 
on the 
-plane, namely, the disk 
. Since
on 
and
we have
The disk 
is oriented downward, so its unit normal vector is 
and we have
since 
on 
. Finally, we compute, by deﬁnition,
as the sum of the
surface integrals of 
over the pieces 
and 
:
Although we motivated the surface integral of a vector ﬁeld using the example of
ﬂuid ﬂow, this concept also arises in other physical situations. For instance, if

is called the electric ﬂux of 
through the surface . One of the important laws of
electrostatics is Gauss’s Law, which says that the net charge enclosed by a closed sur-
face 
is
where 
is a constant (called the permittivity of free space) that depends on the units
used. (In the SI system,
C 
.) Therefore, if the vector ﬁeld
in Example 4 represents an electric ﬁeld, we can conclude that the charge enclosed
by 
is 
.
Another application of surface integrals occurs in the study of heat ﬂow. Suppose
the temperature at a point 
in a body is 
. Then the heat ﬂow is deﬁned
as the vector ﬁeld
where 
is an experimentally determined constant called the conductivity of the sub-
stance. The rate of heat ﬂow across the surface in the body is then given by the sur-
face integral
EXAMPLE 6 The temperature 
in a metal ball is proportional to the square of the
distance from the center of the ball. Find the rate of heat ﬂow across a sphere 
of 
radius 
with center at the center of the ball.
SOLUTION Taking the center of the ball to be at the origin, we have
where 
is the proportionality constant. Then the heat ﬂow is
where 
is the conductivity of the metal. Instead of using the usual parametrization
of the sphere as in Example 4, we observe that the outward unit normal to the
sphere 
at the point 
is
and so
But on 
we have 
, so 
. Therefore, the rate of
heat ﬂow across 
is

Stokes’ Theorem can be regarded as a higher-dimensional version of Green’s Theo-
rem. Whereas Green’s Theorem relates a double integral over a plane region 
to a
line integral around its plane boundary curve, Stokes’ Theorem relates a surface inte-
gral over a surface to a line integral around the boundary curve of (which is a space
curve). Figure 1 shows an oriented surface with unit normal vector . The orientation
of 
induces the positive orientation of the boundary curve C shown in the ﬁgure.
This means that if you walk in the positive direction around 
with your head point-
ing in the direction of , then the surface will always be on your left.
Stokes’ Theorem Let 
be an oriented piecewise-smooth surface that is bounded
by a simple, closed, piecewise-smooth boundary curve 
with positive orienta-
tion. Let 
be a vector ﬁeld whose components have continuous partial deriva-
tives on an open region in

Since
Stokes’ Theorem says that the line integral around the boundary curve of of the tan-
gential component of 
is equal to the surface integral of the normal component of the
curl of .
The positively oriented boundary curve of the oriented surface is often written as 
, so Stokes’ Theorem can be expressed as
There is an analogy among Stokes’ Theorem, Green’s Theorem, and the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus. As before, there is an integral involving derivatives on the left
side of Equation 1 (recall that 
is a sort of derivative of ) and the right side
involves the values of 
only on the boundary of .
In fact, in the special case where the surface 
is ﬂat and lies in the 
-plane with
upward orientation, the unit normal is , the surface integral becomes a double inte-
gral, and Stokes’ Theorem becomes
This is precisely the vector form of Green’s Theorem given in Equation 13.5.12. Thus,
we see that Green’s Theorem is really a special case of Stokes’ Theorem.
Although Stokes’ Theorem is too difﬁcult for us to prove in its full generality, we
can give a proof when 
is a graph and , , and 
are well behaved.
Proof of a Special Case of Stokes’ Theorem We assume that the equation of 
is
, where has continuous second-order partial derivatives and
is a simple plane region whose boundary curve 
corresponds to . If the orien-
tation of 
is upward, then the positive orientation of 
corresponds to the positive
orientation of 
. (See Figure 2.) We are given that 
, where the
partial derivatives of ,
, and 
are continuous.
Since 
is a graph of a function, we can apply Formula 13.6.10 with 
replaced
by 
. The result is
where the partial derivatives of ,

L Stokes’ Theorem is named after the
Irish mathematical physicist Sir George
Stokes (1819–1903). Stokes was a pro-
fessor at Cambridge University (in fact 
he held the same position as Newton,
Lucasian Professor of Mathematics) and
was especially noted for his studies of
ﬂuid ﬂow and light. What we call
Stokes’ Theorem was actually discovered
by the Scottish physicist Sir William
Thomson (1824–1907, known as Lord
Kelvin). Stokes learned of this theorem 
in a letter from Thomson in 1850 and
asked students to prove it on an exami-
nation at Cambridge University in 1854.
We don’t know if any of those students
was able to do so.

This allows us, with the aid of the Chain Rule, to evaluate the line integral as follows:

again and remembering that ,

are functions of , , and and that is
itself a function of and , we get
Four of the terms in this double integral cancel and the remaining six terms can be
arranged to coincide with the right side of Equation 2. Therefore

We now use Stokes’ Theorem to throw some light on the meaning of the curl vec-
tor. Suppose that 
is an oriented closed curve and 
represents the velocity ﬁeld in
ﬂuid ﬂow. Consider the line integral
and recall that 
is the component of 
in the direction of the unit tangent vector
. This means that the closer the direction of 
is to the direction of , the larger the
value of 
. Thus,
is a measure of the tendency of the ﬂuid to move around
and is called the circulation of 
around . (See Figure 5.)
Now let 
be a point in the ﬂuid and let 
be a small disk with radius 
and center 
Then (
for all points 
on 
because 
is
continuous. Thus, by Stokes’Theorem, we get the following approximation to the cir-
culation around the boundary circle 
:
This approximation becomes better as 
and we have
Equation 4 gives the relationship between the curl and the circulation. It shows that
is a measure of the rotating effect of the ﬂuid about the axis n. The curling
effect is greatest about the axis parallel to 
.
Finally, we mention that Stokes’ Theorem can be used to prove Theorem 13.5.4
(which states that if 
on all of 
, then 
is conservative). From our 
previous work (Theorems 13.3.3 and 13.3.4), we know that 
is conservative if
for every closed path . Given , suppose we can ﬁnd an orientable sur-
face whose boundary is . (This can be done, but the proof requires advanced tech-
niques.) Then Stokes’ Theorem gives
A curve that is not simple can be broken into a number of simple curves, and the 
integrals around these simple curves are all 0. Adding these integrals, we obtain
for any closed curve .

WRITING PROJECT THREE MEN AND TWO THEOREMS

Three Men and Two Theorems
Although two of the most important theorems in vector calculus are named after George
Green and George Stokes, a third man, William Thomson (also known as Lord Kelvin),
played a large role in the formulation, dissemination, and application of both of these
results. All three men were interested in how the two theorems could help to explain and
predict physical phenomena in electricity and magnetism and ﬂuid ﬂow. The basic facts of
the story are given in the margin notes on pages 946 and 972.
Write a report on the historical origins of Green’s Theorem and Stokes’ Theorem. Explain
the similarities and relationship between the theorems. Discuss the roles that Green, Thom-
son, and Stokes played in discovering these theorems and making them widely known.
Show how both theorems arose from the investigation of electricity and magnetism and
were later used to study a variety of physical problems.
The dictionary edited by Gillispie [2] is a good source for both biographical and scientiﬁc
information. The book by Hutchinson [5] gives an account of Stokes’ life and the book by
Thompson [8] is a biography of Lord Kelvin. The articles by Grattan-Guinness [3] and 
Gray [4] and the book by Cannell [1] give background on the extraordinary life and works
of Green. Additional historical and mathematical information is found in the books by
Katz [6] and Kline [7].

In Section 13.5 we rewrote Green’s Theorem in a vector version as
where 
is the positively oriented boundary curve of the plane region . If we were
seeking to extend this theorem to vector ﬁelds on 
, we might make the guess that
where 
is the boundary surface of the solid region . It turns out that Equation 1 is
true, under appropriate hypotheses, and is called the Divergence Theorem. Notice its
similarity to Green’s Theorem and Stokes’ Theorem in that it relates the integral of a
derivative of a function (
in this case) over a region to the integral of the original
function 
over the boundary of the region.
At this stage you may wish to review the various types of regions over which we
were able to evaluate triple integrals in Section 12.7. We state and prove the Diver-
gence Theorem for regions 
that are simultaneously of types 1, 2, and 3 and we call
such regions simple solid regions. (For instance, regions bounded by ellipsoids or
rectangular boxes are simple solid regions.) The boundary of 
is a closed surface, and
we use the convention, introduced in Section 13.6, that the positive orientation is out-
ward; that is, the unit normal vector 
is directed outward from .
The Divergence Theorem Let 
be a simple solid region and let S be the boundary
surface of E, given with positive (outward) orientation. Let 
be a vector ﬁeld
whose component functions have continuous partial derivatives on an open
region that contains . Then
Thus, the Divergence Theorem states that, under the given conditions, the ﬂux of
across the boundary surface of 
is equal to the triple integral of the divergence of
over .

CHAPTER 13 VECTOR CALCULUS
L The Divergence Theorem is sometimes
called Gauss’s Theorem after the great
German mathematician Karl Friedrich
Gauss (1777–1855), who discovered
this theorem during his investigation 
of electrostatics. In Eastern Europe the
Divergence Theorem is known as 
Ostrogradsky’s Theorem after the Russian
mathematician Mikhail Ostrogradsky
(1801–1862), who published this result
in 1826.

If 
is the unit outward normal of , then the surface integral on the left side of the
Divergence Theorem is
Therefore, to prove the Divergence Theorem, it sufﬁces to prove the following three
equations:
To prove Equation 4 we use the fact that 
is a type 1 region:
where 
is the projection of 
onto the 
-plane. By Equation 12.7.6, we have
and, therefore, by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,
The boundary surface 
consists of three pieces: the bottom surface 
, the top
surface 
, and possibly a vertical surface 
, which lies above the boundary curve of
D. (See Figure 1. It might happen that 
doesn’t appear, as in the case of a sphere.)
Notice that on 
we have 
, because k is vertical and n is horizontal, and so
Thus, regardless of whether there is a vertical surface, we can write
The equation of 
is

, and the outward normal 
points
upward, so from Equation 13.6.10 (with

L Notice that the method of proof of the
Divergence Theorem is very similar to
that of Green’s Theorem.
L The solution in Example 1 should 
be compared with the solution in 
Example 4 in Section 13.6.

SOLUTION It would be extremely difﬁcult to evaluate the given surface integral
directly. (We would have to evaluate four surface integrals corresponding to the four
pieces of .) Furthermore, the divergence of 
is much less complicated than 
itself:
Therefore, we use the Divergence Theorem to transform the given surface integral
into a triple integral. The easiest way to evaluate the triple integral is to express 
as
a type 3 region:
Then we have
Although we have proved the Divergence Theorem only for simple solid regions,
it can be proved for regions that are ﬁnite unions of simple solid regions. (The proce-
dure is similar to the one we used in Section 13.4 to extend Green’s Theorem.)
For example, let’s consider the region
that lies between the closed surfaces
and
, where 
lies inside 
. Let 
and 
be outward normals of 
and 
. Then the
boundary surface of 
is 
and its normal is given by 
on 
and
on 
. (See Figure 3.) Applying the Divergence Theorem to , we get
Let’s apply this to the electric ﬁeld (see Example 5 in Section 13.1):

where 
is a small sphere with radius 
and center the origin. You can verify that
(see Exercise 19). Therefore, Equation 7 gives
The point of this calculation is that we can compute the surface integral over 
because 
is a sphere. The normal vector at 
is 
. Therefore
since the equation of 
is 
. Thus, we have
This shows that the electric ﬂux of

through any closed surface 
that con-
tains the origin. [This is a special case of Gauss’s Law (Equation 13.6.11) for a single
charge. The relationship between 
and 
is 
.]
Another application of the Divergence Theorem occurs in ﬂuid ﬂow. Let 
be the velocity ﬁeld of a ﬂuid with constant density . Then 
is the rate of ﬂow
per unit area. If 
is a point in the ﬂuid and 
is a ball with center 
and
very small radius , then 
for all points in 
since 
is con-
tinuous. We approximate the ﬂux over the boundary sphere 
as follows:
This approximation becomes better as 
and suggests that
Equation 8 says that 
is the net rate of outward ﬂux per unit volume at 
.
(This is the reason for the name divergence.) If 
, the net ﬂow is outward
near 
and 
is called a source. If 
, the net ﬂow is inward near 
and 
is called a sink.

CHAPTER 13 VECTOR CALCULUS

For the vector ﬁeld in Figure 4, it appears that the vectors that end near 
are
shorter than the vectors that start near 
Thus, the net ﬂow is outward near 
so
and 
is a source. Near 
on the other hand, the incoming arrows 
are longer than the outgoing arrows. Here the net ﬂow is inward, so 
and 
is a sink. We can use the formula for F to conﬁrm this impression. Since
, we have 
, which is positive when 
. So the
points above the line 
are sources and those below are sinks.

The main results of this chapter are all higher-dimensional versions of the Funda-
mental Theorem of Calculus. To help you remember them, we collect them together
here (without hypotheses) so that you can see more easily their essential similarity.
Notice that in each case we have an integral of a “derivative” over a region on the left
side, and the right side involves the values of the original function only on the bound-
ary of the region.

1. Let 
be a smooth parametric surface and let 
be a point such that each line that starts
at 
intersects 
at most once. The solid angle
subtended by 
at 
is the set of
lines starting at 
and passing through . Let 
be the intersection of 
with the
surface of the sphere with center 
and radius . Then the measure of the solid angle (in
steradians) is deﬁned to be
Apply the Divergence Theorem to the part of 
between 
and 
to show that
where is the radius vector from 
to any point on ,
, and the unit normal
vector 
is directed away from .
This shows that the deﬁnition of the measure of a solid angle is independent of the
radius 
of the sphere. Thus, the measure of the solid angle is equal to the area sub-
tended on a unit sphere. (Note the analogy with the deﬁnition of radian measure.) The
total solid angle subtended by a sphere at its center is thus 
steradians.
2. Find the simple closed curve

4. The ﬁgure depicts the sequence of events in each cylinder of a four-cylinder internal
combustion engine. Each piston moves up and down and is connected by a pivoted arm
to a rotating crankshaft. Let 
and 
be the pressure and volume within a cylinder
at time , where 
gives the time required for a complete cycle. The graph
shows how 
and 
vary through one cycle of a four-stroke engine.
During the intake stroke (from x to y) a mixture of air and gasoline at atmospheric
pressure is drawn into a cylinder through the intake valve as the piston moves down-
ward. Then the piston rapidly compresses the mix with the valves closed in the 
compression stroke (from y to z) during which the pressure rises and the volume
decreases. At z the sparkplug ignites the fuel, raising the temperature and pressure at
almost constant volume to {. Then, with valves closed, the rapid expansion forces the
piston downward during the power stroke (from { to |). The exhaust valve opens,
temperature and pressure drop, and mechanical energy stored in a rotating ﬂywheel
pushes the piston upward, forcing the waste products out of the exhaust valve in the
exhaust stroke. The exhaust valve closes and the intake valve opens. We’re now back at
x and the cycle starts again.
(a) Show that the work done on the piston during one cycle of a four-stroke engine is

be the distance from the piston to the top of the cylinder and note
that the force on the piston is 
, where 
is the area of the top of the
piston. Then

is given by

alternative approach is to work directly with Riemann sums.]

the two loops of .

Certain sets of real numbers, called intervals, occur frequently in calculus and corre-
spond geometrically to line segments. For example, if 
, the open interval from
to 
consists of all numbers between 
and 
and is denoted by the symbol 
.
Using set-builder notation, we can write
Notice that the endpoints of the interval—namely,
and —are excluded. This is
indicated by the round brackets 
and by the open dots in Figure 1. The closed inter-
val from 
to 
is the set
Here the endpoints of the interval are included. This is indicated by the square brack-
ets 
and by the solid dots in Figure 2. It is also possible to include only one endpoint
in an interval, as shown in Table 1.
We also need to consider inﬁnite intervals such as
This does not mean that 
(“inﬁnity”) is a number. The notation 
stands for the
set of all numbers that are greater than , so the symbol 
simply indicates that the
interval extends indeﬁnitely far in the positive direction.

Rule 1 says that we can add any number to both sides of an inequality, and Rule 2
says that two inequalities can be added. However, we have to be careful with multi-
plication. Rule 3 says that we can multiply both sides of an inequality by a positive 
| number, but Rule 4 says that if we multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative
number, then we reverse the direction of the inequality. For example, if we take the
inequality 
and multiply by , we get 
, but if we multiply by 
, we get
. Finally, Rule 5 says that if we take reciprocals, then we reverse the direc-
tion of an inequality (provided the numbers are positive).
EXAMPLE 1 Solve the inequality 
.
SOLUTION The given inequality is satisﬁed by some values of but not by others. To
solve an inequality means to determine the set of numbers for which the inequality
is true. This is called the solution set. 
First we subtract 1 from each side of the inequality (using Rule 1 with 
):
Then we subtract 
from both sides (Rule 1 with 
):
Now we divide both sides by 
(Rule 4 with 
):
These steps can all be reversed, so the solution set consists of all numbers greater
than 
. In other words, the solution of the inequality is the interval 
.
EXAMPLE 2 Solve the inequality 
.
SOLUTION First we factor the left side:
We know that the corresponding equation 
has the solutions 2
and 3. The numbers 2 and 3 divide the real line into three intervals:
On each of these intervals we determine the signs of the factors. For instance,
Then we record these signs in the following chart:

Another method for obtaining the information in the chart is to use test values.
For instance, if we use the test value 
for the interval 
, then substitu-
tion in 
gives
The polynomial 
doesn’t change sign inside any of the three intervals,
so we conclude that it is positive on 
.
Then we read from the chart that 
is negative when 
.
Thus, the solution of the inequality 
is
Notice that we have included the endpoints 2 and 3 because we are looking for 
values of such that the product is either negative or zero. The solution is illustrated
in Figure 4.
EXAMPLE 3 Solve

SOLUTION First we take all nonzero terms to one side of the inequality sign and factor
the resulting expression:
As in Example 2 we solve the corresponding equation 
and use
the solutions 
,
, and 
to divide the real line into four intervals
,
,
, and 
. On each interval the product keeps a constant
sign as shown in the following chart.
Then we read from the chart that the solution set is

The points in a plane can be identiﬁed with ordered pairs of real numbers. We start by
drawing two perpendicular coordinate lines that intersect at the origin 
on each line.
Usually one line is horizontal with positive direction to the right and is called the 
-axis; the other line is vertical with positive direction upward and is called the -axis.
Any point 
in the plane can be located by a unique ordered pair of numbers as fol-
lows. Draw lines through 
perpendicular to the - and -axes. These lines intersect
the axes in points with coordinates 
and 
as shown in Figure 1. Then the point 
is
assigned the ordered pair 
. The ﬁrst number 
is called the x-coordinate of ;
the second number 
is called the y-coordinate of . We say that 
is the point with
coordinates 
, and we denote the point by the symbol 
. Several points are
labeled with their coordinates in Figure 2.

By reversing the preceding process we can start with an ordered pair 
and
arrive at the corresponding point . Often we identify the point with the ordered pair
and refer to “the point 
.” [Although the notation used for an open interval
is the same as the notation used for a point 
, you will be able to tell from
the context which meaning is intended.]
This coordinate system is called the rectangular coordinate system or the Car-
tesian coordinate system in honor of the French mathematician René Descartes
(1596–1650), even though another Frenchman, Pierre Fermat (1601–1665), invented
the principles of analytic geometry at about the same time as Descartes. The plane
supplied with this coordinate system is called the coordinate plane or the Cartesian
plane and is denoted by
.
The - and -axes are called the coordinate axes and divide the Cartesian plane
into four quadrants, which are labeled I, II, III, and IV in Figure 1. Notice that the ﬁrst
quadrant consists of those points whose - and -coordinates are both positive.
EXAMPLE 1 Describe and sketch the regions given by the following sets.
(a)
(b)
(c )
SOLUTION
(a) The points whose -coordinates are 0 or positive lie on the -axis or to the right
of it as indicated by the shaded region in Figure 3(a).
(b) The set of all points with -coordinate 1 is a horizontal line one unit above the
[see Figure 3(b)].
(c) Recall from Appendix A that
The given region consists of those points in the plane whose -coordinates lie
between 
and . Thus, the region consists of all points that lie between (but not
on) the horizontal lines 
and 
. [These lines are shown as dashed lines
in Figure 3(c) to indicate that the points on these lines don’t lie in the set.]
Recall from Appendix A that the distance between points and on a number line
is 
. Thus, the distance between points 
and 
on
a horizontal line must be 
and the distance between 
and 
on a vertical line must be 
. (See Figure 4.)
To ﬁnd the distance 
between any two points 
and 
, we
note that triangle 
in Figure 4 is a right triangle, and so by the Pythagorean

Circles
An equation of a curve is an equation satisﬁed by the coordinates of the points on the
curve and by no other points. Let’s use the distance formula to ﬁnd the equation of a
circle with radius 
and center 
. By deﬁnition, the circle is the set of all points
whose distance from the center 
is . (See Figure 5.) Thus,

circle if and only if 
. From the distance formula, we have
or equivalently, squaring both sides, we get
This is the desired equation.

equation:
or
Comparing this equation with the standard equation of a circle, we see that 
and 
, so the given equation represents a circle with center 
and
radius 
. It is sketched in Figure 6.
Lines
To ﬁnd the equation of a line 
we use its slope, which is a measure of the steepness
of the line.
Definition The slope of a nonvertical line that passes through the points
and 
is
The slope of a vertical line is not deﬁned.
Thus, the slope of a line is the ratio of the change in ,
, to the change in ,
(see Figure 7). The slope is therefore the rate of change of y with respect to x. The fact
that the line is straight means that the rate of change is constant.
Figure 8 shows several lines labeled with their slopes. Notice that lines with posi-
tive slope slant upward to the right, whereas lines with negative slope slant downward
to the right. Notice also that the steepest lines are the ones for which the absolute value
of the slope is largest, and a horizontal line has slope 0.
Now let’s ﬁnd an equation of the line that passes through a given point 
and has slope . A point 
with 
lies on this line if and only if the slope
of the line through 
and 
is equal to ; that is,
This equation can be rewritten in the form
and we observe that this equation is also satisﬁed when 
and 
. Therefore,
it is an equation of the given line.

EXAMPLE 3 Find an equation of the line through the points 
and 
.
SOLUTION The slope of the line is
Using the point-slope form with 
and 
, we obtain
which simpliﬁes to
Suppose a nonvertical line has slope 
and -intercept . (See Figure 9.) This means
it intersects the -axis at the point 
, so the point-slope form of the equation of the
line, with 
and 
, becomes
This simpliﬁes as follows.
Slope-Intercept Form of the Equation of a Line An equation of the line with slope 
and -intercept is
In particular, if a line is horizontal, its slope is 
, so its equation is 
,
where 
is the -intercept (see Figure 10). A vertical line does not have a slope, but
we can write its equation as 
, where 
is the -intercept, because the -coordi-
nate of every point on the line is .
EXAMPLE 4 Graph the inequality 
.
SOLUTION We are asked to sketch the graph of the set 
and we
begin by solving the inequality for :
Compare this inequality with the equation 
, which represents a line
with slope 
and -intercept . We see that the given graph consists of points
whose -coordinates are larger than those on the line 
. Thus, the graph
is the region that lies above the line, as illustrated in Figure 11.
Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
Slopes can be used to show that lines are parallel or perpendicular. The following facts
are proved, for instance, in Precalculus: Mathematics for Calculus, Third Edition by
Stewart, Redlin, and Watson (BrooksCole Publishing Co., Paciﬁc Grove, CA, 1998).

Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
1. Two nonvertical lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope.
2. Two lines with slopes 
and 
are perpendicular if and only if
; that is, their slopes are negative reciprocals:
EXAMPLE 5 Find an equation of the line through the point 
that is parallel to the
line 
.
SOLUTION The given line can be written in the form
which is in slope-intercept form with 
. Parallel lines have the same slope, so
the required line has slope 
and its equation in point-slope form is
We can write this equation as 
.
EXAMPLE 6 Show that the lines 
and 
are perpendicular.
SOLUTION The equations can be written as
from which we see that the slopes are
Since 
, the lines are perpendicular.
Conic Sections
Here we review the geometric deﬁnitions of parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas and
their standard equations. They are called conic sections, or conics, because they result
from intersecting a cone with a plane as shown in Figure 12.

Parabolas
A parabola is the set of points in a plane that are equidistant from a ﬁxed point 
(called the focus) and a ﬁxed line (called the directrix). This deﬁnition is illustrated
by Figure 13. Notice that the point halfway between the focus and the directrix lies on
the parabola; it is called the vertex. The line through the focus perpendicular to the
directrix is called the axis of the parabola.
In the 16th century Galileo showed that the path of a projectile that is shot into the 
air at an angle to the ground is a parabola. Since then, parabolic shapes have been used 
in designing automobile headlights, reﬂecting telescopes, and suspension bridges. 
(See Problem 16 on page 263 for the reﬂection property of parabolas that makes them
so useful.)
We obtain a particularly simple equation for a parabola if we place its vertex at the
origin 
and its directrix parallel to the -axis as in Figure 14. If the focus is the point
, then the directrix has the equation 
and the parabola has the equation
(See Exercise 47.)
If we write 
, then the equation of the parabola becomes 
Figure 15 shows the graphs of several parabolas with equations of the form 
for various values of the number . We see that the parabola 
opens upward if
and downward if 
(as in Figure 16). The graph is symmetric with respect
to the -axis because its equation is unchanged when is replaced by 
. This corre-
sponds to the fact that the function 
is an even function.
If we interchange and in the equation 
, the result is 
, which also
represents a parabola. (Interchanging and amounts to reﬂecting about the diagonal

.) The parabola 
opens to the right if 
and to the left if 
(See Figure 17.) This time the parabola is symmetric with respect to the -axis
because the equation is unchanged when is replaced by 
.
EXAMPLE 7 Sketch the region bounded by the parabola 
and the
line
.
SOLUTION First we ﬁnd the points of intersection by solving the two equations. Substi-
tuting 
into the equation 
, we get 
, which
gives
so 
or 
. Thus, the points of intersection are 
and 
, and we
draw the line 
passing through these points.
To sketch the parabola 
we start with the parabola 
in 
Figure 17(b) and shift one unit to the right. We also make sure it passes through 
the points 
and 
. The region bounded by 
and
means the ﬁnite region whose boundaries are these curves. It is
sketched in Figure 18. 
Ellipses
An ellipse is the set of points in a plane the sum of whose distances from two ﬁxed
points 
and 
is a constant (see Figure 19). These two ﬁxed points are called the
foci (plural of focus). One of Kepler’s laws is that the orbits of the planets in the solar
system are ellipses with the Sun at one focus.
In order to obtain the simplest equation for an ellipse, we place the foci on the 
-axis at the points 
and 
as in Figure 20, so that the origin is halfway
between the foci. If we let the sum of the distances from a point on the ellipse to the
foci be 
, then we can write an equation of the ellipse as

where 
. (See Exercise 49 and Figure 21.) Notice that the -intercepts are
, the -intercepts are 
, the foci are 
, and the ellipse is symmetric with
respect to both axes. If the foci of an ellipse are located on the 
axis at 
, then
we can ﬁnd its equation by interchanging and in (1).
EXAMPLE 8 Sketch the graph of 
and locate the foci.
SOLUTION Divide both sides of the equation by 144:
The equation is now in the standard form for an ellipse, so we have 
,
,
, and 
. The -intercepts are 
and the -intercepts are 
.
Also,
, so 
and the foci are 
. The graph is
sketched in Figure 22.
Like parabolas, ellipses have an interesting reﬂection property that has practical
consequences. If a source of light or sound is placed at one focus of a surface with
elliptical cross-sections, then all the light or sound is reﬂected off the surface to the
other focus (see Exercise 55). This principle is used in lithotripsy, a treatment for kid-
ney stones. A reﬂector with elliptical cross-section is placed in such a way that the 
kidney stone is at one focus. High-intensity sound waves generated at the other focus
are reﬂected to the stone and destroy it without damaging surrounding tissue. The
patient is spared the trauma of surgery and recovers within a few days.
Hyperbolas
A hyperbola is the set of all points in a plane the difference of whose distances from
two ﬁxed points 
and 
(the foci) is a constant. This deﬁnition is illustrated in
Figure 23.
Notice that the deﬁnition of a hyperbola is similar to that of an ellipse; the only
change is that the sum of distances has become a difference of distances. It is left as
Exercise 51 to show that when the foci are on the -axis at 
and the difference
of distances is 
, then the equation of the hyperbola is
where 
. Notice that the -intercepts are again 
, But if we put 
in Equation 2 we get 
, which is impossible, so there is no -intercept. The
hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both axes.
To analyze the hyperbola further, we look at Equation 2 and obtain

This means that the hyperbola consists of two parts, called its branches.
When we draw a hyperbola it is useful to ﬁrst draw its asymptotes, which are the
lines 
and 
shown in Figure 24. Both branches of the hyper-
bola approach the asymptotes; that is, they come arbitrarily close to the asymptotes.
If the foci of a hyperbola are on the -axis, we ﬁnd its equation by reversing the roles
of and .

and
sketch its graph.

Here we review the aspects of trigonometry that are used in calculus: radian measure,
trigonometric functions, trigonometric identities, and inverse trigonometric functions.
Angles
Angles can be measured in degrees or in radians (abbreviated as rad). The angle given
by a complete revolution contains 
, which is the same as 
rad. Therefore
and
EXAMPLE 1
(a) Find the radian measure of 
.
(b) Express 
rad in degrees.
SOLUTION
(a) From Equation 1 or 2 we see that to convert from degrees to radians we multi-
ply by 
. Therefore
(b) To convert from radians to degrees we multiply by 
. Thus
In calculus we use radians to measure angles except when otherwise indicated. The
following table gives the correspondence between degree and radian measures of
some common angles.
Figure 1 shows a sector of a circle with central angle and radius subtending an
arc with length . Since the length of the arc is proportional to the size of the angle,
and since the entire circle has circumference 
and central angle 
, we have
Solving this equation for and for , we obtain

Remember that Equations 3 are valid only when 
is measured in radians.
In particular, putting 
in Equation 3, we see that an angle of 1 rad is the angle
subtended at the center of a circle by an arc equal in length to the radius of the circle
(see Figure 2).
EXAMPLE 2
(a) If the radius of a circle is 5 cm, what angle is subtended by an arc of 6 cm?
(b) If a circle has radius 3 cm, what is the length of an arc subtended by a central
angle of 
rad?
SOLUTION

The standard position of an angle occurs when we place its vertex at the origin of
a coordinate system and its initial side on the positive -axis as in Figure 3.
A positive angle is obtained by rotating the initial side counterclockwise until it
coincides with the terminal side. Likewise, negative angles are obtained by clockwise
rotation as in Figure 4. Figure 5 shows several examples of angles in standard posi-
tion. Notice that different angles can have the same terminal side. For instance, the
angles 
,
, and 
have the same initial and terminal sides because

The Trigonometric Functions
For an acute angle 
the six trigonometric functions are deﬁned as ratios of lengths of
sides of a right triangle as follows (see Figure 6).
This deﬁnition does not apply to obtuse or negative angles, so for a general angle
in standard position we let 
be any point on the terminal side of 
and we let
be the distance 
as in Figure 7. Then we deﬁne
Since division by 0 is not deﬁned,
and 
are undeﬁned when 
and
and 
are undeﬁned when 
. Notice that the deﬁnitions in (4) and (5)
are consistent when 
is an acute angle.
If 
is a number, the convention is that 
means the sine of the angle whose
radian measure is . For example, the expression 
implies that we are dealing
with an angle of 3 rad. When ﬁnding a calculator approximation to this number we
must remember to set our calculator in radian mode, and then we obtain
If we want to know the sine of the angle 
we would write 
and, with our cal-
culator in degree mode, we ﬁnd that
The exact trigonometric ratios for certain angles can be read from the triangles in

Trigonometric Identities
A trigonometric identity is a relationship among the trigonometric functions. The
most elementary are the following, which are immediate consequences of the deﬁni-
tions of the trigonometric functions.
For the next identity we refer back to Figure 7. The distance formula (or, equiva-
lently, the Pythagorean Theorem) tells us that 
. Therefore
We have therefore proved one of the most useful of all trigonometric identities:
If we now divide both sides of Equation 7 by 
and use Equations 6, we get
Similarly, if we divide both sides of Equation 7 by 
, we get
The identities
show that 
is an odd function and 
is an even function. They are easily proved
by drawing a diagram showing 
and 
in standard position (see Exercise 19).
Since the angles 
and 
have the same terminal side, we have
These identities show that the sine and cosine functions are periodic with period 
.
The remaining trigonometric identities are all consequences of two basic identities
called the addition formulas:

L Odd functions and even functions are

The proofs of these addition formulas are outlined in Exercises 51, 52, and 53.
By substituting 
for 
in Equations 12a and 12b and using Equations 10a and
10b, we obtain the following subtraction formulas:
Then, by dividing the formulas in Equations 12 or Equations 13, we obtain the cor-
responding formulas for

If we put 
in the addition formulas (12), we get the double-angle formulas:
Then, by using the identity 
, we obtain the following alternate
forms of the double-angle formulas for 
:
If we now solve these equations for 
and 
, we get the following half-angle
formulas, which are useful in integral calculus:
There are many other trigonometric identities, but those we have stated are the ones
used most often in calculus. If you forget any of them, remember that they can all be
deduced from Equations 12a and 12b.

Graphs of the Trigonometric Functions
The graph of the function 
, shown in Figure 13(a), is obtained by plotting
points for 
and then using the periodic nature of the function (from Equa-
tion 11) to complete the graph. Notice that the zeros of the sine function occur at the
integer multiples of , that is,
Because of the identity
(which can be veriﬁed using Equation 12a), the graph of cosine is obtained by shift-
ing the graph of sine by an amount 
to the left [see Figure 13(b)]. Note that for
both the sine and cosine functions the domain is 
and the range is the closed
interval 
. Thus, for all values of , we have
The graphs of the remaining four trigonometric functions are shown in Figure 14
and their domains are indicated there. Notice that tangent and cotangent have range
, whereas cosecant and secant have range 
. All four func-
tions are periodic: tangent and cotangent have period , whereas cosecant and secant
have period 
.

Inverse Trigonometric Functions
When we try to ﬁnd the inverse trigonometric functions, we have a slight difﬁculty:
Because the trigonometric functions are not one-to-one, they don’t have inverse func-
tions. The difﬁculty is overcome by restricting the domains of these functions so that
they become one-to-one.
You can see from Figure 15 that the sine function 
is not one-to-one (use
the Horizontal Line Test). But the function 
(see 
Figure 16), is one-to-one. The inverse function of this restricted sine function 
exists
and is denoted by 
or 
. It is called the inverse sine function or the arcsine
function.

The deﬁnitions of limits that have been given in this book are appropriate for intuitive
understanding of the basic concepts of calculus. For the purposes of deeper under-
standing and rigorous proofs, however, the precise deﬁnitions of this appendix are
necessary. In particular, the deﬁnition of a limit given here is used in Appendix E to
prove that the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits. 
When we say that 
has a limit 
as approaches , we mean, according to the
intuitive deﬁnition in Section 2.2, that we can make 
arbitrarily close to 
by 
taking close enough to 
(but not equal to ). A more precise deﬁnition is based on

the idea of specifying just how small we need to make the distance 
in order
to make the distance 
less than some given number. The following example
illustrates the idea.
EXAMPLE 1 Use a graph to ﬁnd a number 
such that
whenever
SOLUTION A graph of 
is shown in Figure 1; we are interested in the
region near the point 
. Notice that we can rewrite the inequality
as
So we need to determine the values of for which the curve 
lies
between the horizontal lines 
and 
. Therefore, we graph the curves
,
, and 
near the point 
in Figure 2. Then 
we use the cursor to estimate that the -coordinate of the point of intersection 
of the line 
and the curve 
is about 
. Similarly,
intersects the line 
when 
. So, rounding to be
safe, we can say that
This interval 
is not symmetric about 
. The distance from 
to
the left endpoint is 
and the distance to the right endpoint is 0.12.
We can choose 
to be the smaller of these numbers, that is,
. Then we can
rewrite our inequalities in terms of distances as follows:
This just says that by keeping within 0.08 of 1, we are able to keep 
within 0.2 
of 2.
Although we chose 
, any smaller positive value of 
would also have
worked.
Using the same graphical procedure as in Example 1, but replacing the number 0.2
by smaller numbers, we ﬁnd that
In each case we have found a number 
such that the values of the function

lie in successively smaller intervals centered at 2 if the distance
from 
to 1 is less than . It turns out that it is always possible to ﬁnd such a number
, no matter how small the interval is. In other words, for any positive number , no
matter how small, there exists a positive number 
such that
This indicates that
and suggests a more precise way of deﬁning the limit of a general function.
Definition Let 
be a function deﬁned on some open interval that contains
the number , except possibly at 
itself. Then we say that the limit of 
as
approaches 
is , and we write
if for every number 
there is a corresponding number 
such that
Deﬁnition 1 is illustrated in Figures 3–5. If a number  
is given, then we draw
the horizontal lines 
and 
and the graph of . (See Figure 3.) If
, then we can ﬁnd a number 
such that if we restrict 
to lie in
the interval 
and take 
, then the curve 
lies between the 
lines 
and 
. (See Figure 4.) You can see that if such a has been
found, then any smaller 
will also work.
It’s important to realize that the process illustrated in Figures 3 and 4 must work
for every positive number no matter how small it is chosen. Figure 5 shows that if a
smaller 
is chosen, then a smaller 
may be required.

deﬁnition to prove that

SOLUTION Let 
be a given positive number. According to Deﬁnition 1 with 
and
, we need to ﬁnd a number 
such that 
that is,
But, since the square root function is an increasing function, we know that
So if we choose

(see Figure 6). This shows that

In proving limit statements it may be helpful to think of the deﬁnition of limit as a
challenge. First it challenges you with a number . Then you must be able to produce
a suitable . You have to be able to do this for every
, not just a particular .
Imagine a contest between two people, A and B, and imagine yourself to be B. Per-
son A stipulates that the ﬁxed number should be approximated by the values of 
to within a degree of accuracy (say, 0.01). Person B then responds by ﬁnding a num-
ber 
such that 
whenever 
. Then A may become
more exacting and challenge B with a smaller value of 
(say, 0.0001). Again B has
to respond by ﬁnding a corresponding . Usually the smaller the value of , the
smaller the corresponding value of must be. If B always wins, no matter how small
A makes , then

Therefore, by the deﬁnition of a limit,
This example is illustrated by Figure 7.
Note that in the solution of Example 2 there were two stages—guessing and prov-
ing. We made a preliminary analysis that enabled us to guess a value for . But then
in the second stage we had to go back and prove in a careful, logical fashion that we
had made a correct guess. This procedure is typical of much of mathematics. Some-
times it is necessary to ﬁrst make an intelligent guess about the answer to a problem
and then prove that the guess is correct.
It’s not always easy to prove that limit statements are true using the 
deﬁnition.
For a more complicated function such as 
, a proof
would require a great deal of ingenuity. Fortunately, this is not necessary because the
Limit Laws stated in Section 2.3 can be proved using Deﬁnition 1, and then the lim-
its of complicated functions can be found rigorously from the Limit Laws without
resorting to the deﬁnition directly.
Limits at Infinity
Inﬁnite limits and limits at inﬁnity can also be deﬁned in a precise way. The follow-
ing is a precise version of Deﬁnition 4 in Section 2.5.
Definition Let 
be a function deﬁned on some interval 
. Then
means that for every 
there is a corresponding number 
such that
In words, this says that the values of 
can be made arbitrarily close to 
(within a distance , where 
is any positive number) by taking 
sufﬁciently large
(larger than 
, where 
depends on ). Graphically it says that by choosing 
large
enough (larger than some number 
) we can make the graph of 
lie between the
given horizontal lines 
and 
as in Figure 8. This must be true no
matter how small we choose . If a smaller value of is chosen, then a larger value of
may be required.

Inﬁnite limits can also be formulated precisely. See Exercise 16.
Sequences
In Section 8.1 we used the notation 
to mean that the terms of the sequence 
approach as becomes large. Notice that
the following precise deﬁnition of the limit of a sequence is very similar to the deﬁ-
nition of a limit of a function at inﬁnity (Deﬁnition 2).
Definition A sequence

plotted on a number line. No matter how small an interval 
is chosen,
there exists an 
such that all terms of the sequence from 
onward must lie in that
interval.
Another illustration of Deﬁnition 3 is given in Figure 12. The points on the graph
of

picture must be valid no matter how small

by making the distance from

tion of Deﬁnition 5 is given in Figure 13 where the surface is the graph of . If

In this appendix we present proofs of some theorems that were stated in the main body
of the text. We start by proving the Triangle Inequality, which is an important prop-
erty of absolute value.
The Triangle Inequality If 
and 
are any real numbers, then
Observe that if the numbers and are both positive or both negative, then the two
sides in the Triangle Inequality are actually equal. But if and have opposite signs,
the left side involves a subtraction and the right side does not. This makes the Triangle
Inequality seem reasonable, but we can prove it as follows.
Notice that
is always true because 
equals either 
or 
. The corresponding statement for
is
Adding these inequalities, we get
If we now apply Properties 4 and 5 of absolute value from Appendix A (with 
re-
placed by 
and 
by 
), we obtain
which is what we wanted to show.
Next we use the Triangle Inequality to prove the Sum Law for limits.
Sum Law If 
and 
both exist, then
Proof Let 
be given. According to Deﬁnition 1 in Appendix D, we must ﬁnd
such that

Taking the right-hand limit of both sides of this inequality (using Theorem 2.3.2),
we get
But since 
exists, we have
and so we have shown that 
.
If 
, then the direction of the inequality (2) is reversed when we divide by :
So, taking the left-hand limit, we have
We have shown that 
and also that 
. Since both of these inequali-
ties must be true, the only possibility is that 
.
We have proved Fermat’s Theorem for the case of a local maximum. The case of
a local minimum can be proved in a similar manner.

This gives us an expression for the ﬁrst part of the right side of Equation 3. For the

Therefore, f is differentiable at

(by Clairaut’s Theorem)
If we complete the square in this expression, we obtain
We are given that

APPENDIX G INTEGRATION OF RATIONAL FUNCTIONS BY PARTIAL FRACTIONS
Integration of Rational Functions by Partial Fractions
G
G
G

In this appendix we show how to integrate any rational function (a ratio of polynomi-
als) by expressing it as a sum of simpler fractions, called partial fractions, that we
already know how to integrate. To illustrate the method, observe that by taking the
fractions 
and 
to a common denominator we obtain
If we now reverse the procedure, we see how to integrate the function on the right side
of this equation:
To see how the method of partial fractions works in general, let’s consider a
rational function
where 
and 
are polynomials. It’s possible to express 
as a sum of simpler frac-
tions provided that the degree of 
is less than the degree of . Such a rational func-
tion is called proper. Recall that if
where 
, then the degree of 
is and we write 
.
If 
is improper, that is,
, then we must take the preliminary step
of dividing 
into 
(by long division) until a remainder 
is obtained such that
. The division statement is
where 
and 
are also polynomials.
As the following example illustrates, sometimes this preliminary step is all that is
required.
EXAMPLE 1 Find 
.
SOLUTION Since the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denomi-
nator, we ﬁrst perform the long division. This enables us to write

The next step is to factor the denominator 
as far as possible. It can be shown
that any polynomial 
can be factored as a product of linear factors (of the form 
and irreducible quadratic factors (of the form 
, where 
).
For instance, if 
, we could factor it as
The third step is to express the proper rational function 
(from Equation 1)
as a sum of partial fractions of the form
A theorem in algebra guarantees that it is always possible to do this. We explain the
details for the four cases that occur.
CASE I
G The denominator 
is a product of distinct linear factors.
This means that we can write
where no factor is repeated. In this case the partial fraction theorem states that there
exist constants 
such that
These constants can be determined as in the following example.
EXAMPLE 2 Evaluate 
.
SOLUTION Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denomina-
tor, we don’t need to divide. We factor the denominator as
Since the denominator has three distinct linear factors, the partial fraction decompo-
sition of the integrand (2) has the form
To determine the values of ,
, and , we multiply both sides of this equation by
the product of the denominators,
, obtaining
Expanding the right side of Equation 4 and writing it in the standard form for
polynomials, we get

APPENDIX G INTEGRATION OF RATIONAL FUNCTIONS BY PARTIAL FRACTIONS
The polynomials in Equation 5 are identical, so their coefﬁcients must be equal. The
coefﬁcient of 
on the right side,
, must equal the coefﬁcient of 
on
the left side—namely, 1. Likewise, the coefﬁcients of are equal and the constant
terms are equal. This gives the following system of equations for ,
, and :
Solving, we get 
,
, and 
, and so
In integrating the middle term we have made the mental substitution 
,
which gives 
and 
.
NOTE
G We can use an alternative method to ﬁnd the coefﬁcients ,
, and 
in
Example 2. Equation 4 is an identity; it is true for every value of . Let’s choose val-
ues of that simplify the equation. If we put 
in Equation 4, then the second and
third terms on the right side vanish and the equation then becomes 
, or
. Likewise,
gives 
and 
gives 
, so 
and
. (You may object that Equation 3 is not valid for 
, , or 
, so why
should Equation 4 be valid for those values? In fact, Equation 4 is true for all values
of , even 
, , and 
. See Exercise 35 for the reason.)
EXAMPLE 3 Find

SOLUTION The method of partial fractions gives
and therefore
Using the method of the preceding note, we put 
in this equation and get

Suppose the ﬁrst linear factor

By way of illustration, we could write

In order to integrate the second term we split it into two parts:
We make the substitution 
in the ﬁrst of these integrals so that
. We evaluate the second integral by means of Formula 9 with 
:
EXAMPLE 6 Evaluate 
.
SOLUTION Since the degree of the numerator is not less than the degree of the denomi-
nator, we ﬁrst divide and obtain
Notice that the quadratic 
is irreducible because its discriminant is
. This means it can’t be factored, so we don’t need to use the 
partial fraction technique.
To integrate the given function we complete the square in the denominator:
This suggests that we make the substitution 
. Then,

Polar coordinates offer an alternative way of locating points in a plane. They are use-
ful because, for certain types of regions and curves, polar coordinates provide very
simple descriptions and equations. The principal applications of this idea occur in multi-

laws of planetary motion.

A coordinate system represents a point in the plane by an ordered pair of numbers
called coordinates. Usually we use Cartesian coordinates, which are directed distances
from two perpendicular axes. Here we describe a coordinate system introduced 
by Newton, called the polar coordinate system, which is more convenient for many
purposes.
We choose a point in the plane that is called the pole (or origin) and is labeled .
Then we draw a ray (half-line) starting at 
called the polar axis. This axis is usually
drawn horizontally to the right and corresponds to the positive -axis in Cartesian
coordinates.
If 
is any other point in the plane, let be the distance from 
to 
and let 
be
the angle (usually measured in radians) between the polar axis and the line 
as in
Figure 1. Then the point 
is represented by the ordered pair 
and ,
are called
polar coordinates of . We use the convention that an angle is positive if measured
in the counterclockwise direction from the polar axis and negative in the clockwise
direction. If
, then 
and we agree that 
represents the pole for any
value of .
We extend the meaning of polar coordinates 
to the case in which is nega-
tive by agreeing that, as in Figure 2, the points 
and 
lie on the same line
through 
and at the same distance 
from , but on opposite sides of . If 
,
the point 
lies in the same quadrant as ; if 
, it lies in the quadrant on the
opposite side of the pole. Notice that 
represents the same point as 
.

SOLUTION The points are plotted in Figure 3. In part (d) the point 
is
located three units from the pole in the fourth quadrant because the angle 
is in
the second quadrant and 
is negative.
In the Cartesian coordinate system every point has only one representation, but in
the polar coordinate system each point has many representations. For instance, the
point 
in Example 1(a) could be written as 
or 
or
. (See Figure 4.)
In fact, since a complete counterclockwise rotation is given by an angle 2 , the
point represented by polar coordinates 
is also represented by
where 
is any integer.
The connection between polar and Cartesian coordinates can be seen from Figure 5,
in which the pole corresponds to the origin and the polar axis coincides with the pos-
itive -axis. If the point 
has Cartesian coordinates 
and polar coordinates 
then, from the ﬁgure, we have
and so
Although Equations 1 were deduced from Figure 5, which illustrates the case
where

(See
the general deﬁnition of 
and 
in Appendix C.)
Equations 1 allow us to ﬁnd the Cartesian coordinates of a point when the polar
coordinates are known. To ﬁnd and when and are known, we use the equations
which can be deduced from Equations 1 or simply read from Figure 5.

Therefore, the point is 
in Cartesian coordinates.
EXAMPLE 3 Represent the point with Cartesian coordinates 
in terms of polar
coordinates.
SOLUTION If we choose to be positive, then Equations 2 give
Since the point 
lies in the fourth quadrant, we can choose

. Thus, one possible answer is 
; another is 
.
NOTE
G Equations 2 do not uniquely determine 
when 
and 
are given because,
as 
increases through the interval 
, each value of 
occurs twice.
Therefore, in converting from Cartesian to polar coordinates, it’s not good enough just
to ﬁnd and that satisfy Equations 2. As in Example 3, we must choose so that the
point 
lies in the correct quadrant.
The graph of a polar equation

of all points

whose coordinates sat-
isfy the equation.

distance from the point to the pole, the curve 
represents the circle with center

represents a circle with center

(a) In Figure 8 we ﬁnd the values of for some convenient values of

corresponding points

appears to be a circle. We have used only values of

becomes

sine curve up one unit. This enables us to read at a glance the values of that corre-
spond to increasing values of . For instance, we see that as 
increases from 0 to 
,
(the distance from ) increases from 1 to 2, so we sketch the corresponding part
of the polar curve in Figure 11(a). As
increases from 
to , Figure 10 shows
that decreases from 2 to 1, so we sketch the next part of the curve as in Figure 11(b).
As 
increases from 
to 
,
decreases from 1 to 0 as shown in part (c). Finally,
as 
increases from 
to 
,
increases from 0 to 1 as shown in part (d). If we
let 
increase beyond 
or decrease beyond 0, we would simply retrace our path.
Putting together the parts of the curve from Figure 11(a)–(d), we sketch the com-
plete curve in part (e). It is called a cardioid because it’s shaped like a heart.
EXAMPLE 8 Sketch the curve 
.
SOLUTION As in Example 7, we ﬁrst sketch 
,
, in Cartesian
coordinates in Figure 12. As 
increases from 0 to 
, Figure 12 shows that 
decreases from 1 to 0 and so we draw the corresponding portion of the polar curve
in Figure 13 (indicated by !). As 
increases from 
to 
,
goes from 0 to 
.
This means that the distance from 
increases from 0 to 1, but instead of being in
the ﬁrst quadrant this portion of the polar curve (indicated by @) lies on the opposite
side of the pole in the third quadrant. The remainder of the curve is drawn in a simi-
lar fashion, with the arrows and numbers indicating the order in which the portions
are traced out. The resulting curve has four loops and is called a four-leaved rose.
When we sketch polar curves it is sometimes helpful to take advantage of symme-
try. The following three rules are explained by Figure 14.
(a) If a polar equation is unchanged when 
is replaced by 
, the curve is sym-
metric about the polar axis.

(b) If the equation is unchanged when is replaced by 
, the curve is symmetric
about the pole. (This means that the curve remains unchanged if we rotate it
through 180° about the origin.)
(c) If the equation is unchanged when 
is replaced by

metric about the vertical line 
.
The curves sketched in Examples 6 and 8 are symmetric about the polar axis, since
. The curves in Examples 7 and 8 are symmetric about 
because 
and 
. The four-leaved rose is also
symmetric about the pole. These symmetry properties could have been used in sketch-
ing the curves. For instance, in Example 6 we need only have plotted points for
and then reﬂected about the polar axis to obtain the complete circle.
Tangents to Polar Curves
To ﬁnd a tangent line to a polar curve 
we regard 
as a parameter and write
its parametric equations as
Then, using the method for ﬁnding slopes of parametric curves (Equation 3.5.7) and
the Product Rule, we have
We locate horizontal tangents by ﬁnding the points where

(provided that

Notice that if we are looking for tangent lines at the pole, then 
and Equation 3
simpliﬁes to
For instance, in Example 8 we found that

used to derive it. For instance, in Example 9 we could have written
Then we have
which is equivalent to our previous expression.
Graphing Polar Curves with Graphing Devices
Although it’s useful to be able to sketch simple polar curves by hand, we need to use
a graphing calculator or computer when we are faced with a curve as complicated as
the one shown in Figure 16.
Some graphing devices have commands that enable us to graph polar curves
directly. With other machines we need to convert to parametric equations ﬁrst. In this
case we take the polar equation 
and write its parametric equations as
Some machines require that the parameter be called rather than .
EXAMPLE 10 Graph the curve 
.
SOLUTION Let’s assume that our graphing device doesn’t have a built-in polar graphing
command. In this case we need to work with the corresponding parametric equa-
tions, which are
In any case we need to determine the domain for . So we ask ourselves: How many
complete rotations are required until the curve starts to repeat itself? If the answer is 
, then
and so we require that 
be an even multiple of . This will ﬁrst occur when
. Therefore, we will graph the entire curve if we specify that 
.
Switching from 
to , we have the equations
and Figure 17 shows the resulting curve. Notice that this rose has 16 loops.
EXAMPLE 11 Investigate the family of polar curves given by 
. How
does the shape change as changes? (These curves are called limaçons, after a
French word for snail, because of the shape of the curves for certain values of .)
SOLUTION Figure 18 shows computer-drawn graphs for various values of . For 
there is a loop that decreases in size as decreases. When 
the loop disappears

In this section we develop the formula for the area of a region whose boundary is
given by a polar equation. We need to use the formula for the area of a sector of a 
circle
where, as in Figure 1,
is the radius and is the radian measure of the central angle.
Formula 1 follows from the fact that the area of a sector is proportional to its central
angle:
.
Let 
be the region, illustrated in Figure 2, bounded by the polar curve 
and by the rays 
and 
, where is a positive continuous function and where
. We divide the interval 
into subintervals with endpoints

and equal width 
. The rays 
then divide 
into 
smaller
regions with central angle 
. If we choose 
in the th subinterval
, then the area 
of the th region is approximated by the area of the sector
of a circle with central angle 
and radius 
. (See Figure 3.)
Thus, from Formula 1 we have
and so an approximation to the total area 
of 
is
It appears from Figure 3 that the approximation in (2) improves as 
. But the
sums in (2) are Riemann sums for the function 
, so
It therefore appears plausible (and can in fact be proved) that the formula for the area
of the polar region 
is
Formula 3 is often written as
with the understanding that 
. Note the similarity between Formulas 1 and 4.
When we apply Formula 3 or 4 it is helpful to think of the area as being swept out
by a rotating ray through 
that starts with angle 
and ends with angle .
EXAMPLE 1 Find the area enclosed by one loop of the four-leaved rose 
.
SOLUTION The curve 
was sketched in Example 8 in Section H.1. Notice
from Figure 4 that the region enclosed by the right loop is swept out by a ray that
rotates from 
to 
. Therefore, Formula 4 gives
We could evaluate the integral using Formula 64 in the Table of Integrals. Or, as in
Section 5.7, we could use the identity 
to write

EXAMPLE 2 Find the area of the region that lies inside the circle 
and out-
side the cardioid 
.
SOLUTION The cardioid (see Example 7 in Section H.1) and the circle are sketched in
Figure 5 and the desired region is shaded. The values of 
and 
in Formula 4 are
determined by ﬁnding the points of intersection of the two curves. They intersect
when 
, which gives 
, so 
,
. The desired
area can be found by subtracting the area inside the cardioid between 
and
from the area inside the circle from 
to 
. Thus
Since the region is symmetric about the vertical axis 
, we can write
[because 
]
Example 2 illustrates the procedure for ﬁnding the area of the region bounded by
two polar curves. In general, let 
be a region, as illustrated in Figure 6, that is
bounded by curves with polar equations 
,
,
, and 
, where
and 
. The area 
of 
is found by subtracting the
area inside 
from the area inside 
, so using Formula 3 we have
|
CAUTION
G The fact that a single point has many representations in polar coordinates
sometimes makes it difﬁcult to ﬁnd all the points of intersection of two polar curves.
For instance, it is obvious from Figure 5 that the circle and the cardioid have three
points of intersection; however, in Example 2 we solved the equations 
and
and found only two such points,
and 
. The origin is
also a point of intersection, but we can’t ﬁnd it by solving the equations of the curves
because the origin has no single representation in polar coordinates that satisﬁes both
equations. Notice that, when represented as 
or 
, the origin satisﬁes
and so it lies on the circle; when represented as 
, it satisﬁes
and so it lies on the cardioid. Think of two points moving along the
curves as the parameter value 
increases from 0 to 
. On one curve the origin is
reached at 
and 
; on the other curve it is reached at 
. The points
don’t collide at the origin because they reach the origin at different times, but the
curves intersect there nonetheless.
Thus, to ﬁnd all points of intersection of two polar curves, it is recommended that
you draw the graphs of both curves. It is especially convenient to use a graphing cal-
culator or computer to help with this task.

DISCOVERY PROJECT CONIC SECTIONS IN POLAR COORDINATES

Conic Sections in Polar Coordinates
In this project we give a uniﬁed treatment of all three types of conic sections in terms of a
focus and directrix. We will see that if we place the focus at the origin, then a conic section
has a simple polar equation. In Chapter 10 we use the polar equation of an ellipse to derive
Kepler’s laws of planetary motion.
Let 
be a ﬁxed point (called the focus) and be a ﬁxed line (called the directrix) in a
plane. Let be a ﬁxed positive number (called the eccentricity). Let 
be the set of all
points 
in the plane such that 
(that is, the ratio of the distance from 
to the distance from is the constant ). Notice that
if the eccentricity is 
, then 
and so the given condition simply becomes
the deﬁnition of a parabola as given in Appendix B.
1. If we place the focus 
at the origin and the directrix parallel to the -axis and 
units to
the right, then the directrix has equation 
and is perpendicular to the polar axis. If
the point 
has polar coordinates 
, use Figure 1 to show that 
2. By converting the polar equation in Problem 1 to rectangular coordinates, show that the
curve 
is an ellipse if 
. (See Appendix B for a discussion of ellipses.)
3. Show that 
is a hyperbola if 
.
4. Show that the polar equation
represents an ellipse if 
, a parabola if 
, or a hyperbola if 
.
5. For each of the following conics, ﬁnd the eccentricity and directrix. Then identify and
sketch the conic.

8. (a) The planets move around the Sun in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus. The
positions of a planet that are closest to and farthest from the Sun are called its peri-
helion and aphelion, respectively. (See Figure 2.) Use Problem 7(a) to show that the
perihelion distance from a planet to the Sun is

A complex number can be represented by an expression of the form 
, where 
and 
are real numbers and is a symbol with the property that 
. The com-
plex number 
can also be represented by the ordered pair 
and plotted as
a point in a plane (called the Argand plane) as in Figure 1. Thus, the complex number
is identiﬁed with the point 
.
The real part of the complex number 
is the real number 
and the imagi-
nary part is the real number . Thus, the real part of 
is 
and the imaginary
part is 
. Two complex numbers 
and 
are equal if 
and 
,
that is, their real parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal. In the Argand
plane the -axis is called the real axis and the -axis is called the imaginary axis.
The sum and difference of two complex numbers are deﬁned by adding or sub-
tracting their real parts and their imaginary parts:

The product of complex numbers is deﬁned so that the usual commutative and dis-
tributive laws hold:
Since 
, this becomes
EXAMPLE 1
Division of complex numbers is much like rationalizing the denominator of a
rational expression. For the complex number 
, we deﬁne its complex con-
jugate to be 
. To ﬁnd the quotient of two complex numbers we multiply
numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator.
EXAMPLE 2 Express the number 
in the form 
.
SOLUTION We multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of
, namely 
, and we take advantage of the result of Example 1:
The geometric interpretation of the complex conjugate is shown in Figure 2:
is
the reﬂection of in the real axis. We list some of the properties of the complex con-
jugate in the following box. The proofs follow from the deﬁnition and are requested
in Exercise 18.
Properties of Conjugates

of a complex number 
is its dis-
tance from the origin. From Figure 3 we see that if

Since

have

cipal square root of

. In general, if is any positive number,
we write
With this convention the usual derivation and formula for the roots of the quadratic
equation 
are valid even when 
:
EXAMPLE 3 Find the roots of the equation 
.
SOLUTION Using the quadratic formula, we have
We observe that the solutions of the equation in Example 3 are complex conjugates
of each other. In general, the solutions of any quadratic equation 
with real coefﬁcients , , and are always complex conjugates. (If is real,
, so
is its own conjugate.)
We have seen that if we allow complex numbers as solutions, then every quadratic
equation has a solution. More generally, it is true that every polynomial equation
of degree at least one has a solution among the complex numbers. This fact is known
as the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and was proved by Gauss.
Polar Form
We know that any complex number 
can be considered as a point 
and
that any such point can be represented by polar coordinates 
with 
. In fact,
as in Figure 4. Therefore, we have

Therefore, using the addition formulas for cosine and sine, we have
This formula says that to multiply two complex numbers we multiply the moduli and
add the arguments. (See Figure 6.)
A similar argument using the subtraction formulas for sine and cosine shows that
to divide two complex numbers we divide the moduli and subtract the arguments.

the case where the terms are complex numbers. Using the Taylor series for

tion 8.7.11) as our guide, we deﬁne
and it turns out that this complex exponential function has the same properties as the
real exponential function. In particular, it is true that
If we put

27.
If 
, the graph has three humps: two minimum points and a
maximum point. These humps get ﬂatter as c increases until at
two of the humps disappear and there is only one mini-
mum point. This single hump then moves to the right and
approaches the origin as c increases.
29. The hump gets larger and moves to the right.
31. If 
, the loop is to the right of the origin; if 
, the
loop is to the left. The closer c is to 0, the larger the loop.
