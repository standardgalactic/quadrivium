Introduction
A
sk any prospective dog owner what breeds she has in mind,
and almost without fail, she’ll include a Beagle on her list of
possibilities. Her reasons aren’t hard to figure out. Beagles have
so much going for them: They’re cute, they have easygoing person-
alities, they’re small, they require relatively little grooming, and
they’re fun. And did I mention that they’re cute? (I did? Well, no
matter. Their cuteness is an attribute worth emphasizing.)
But inevitably, even a package that appears as perfect as a Beagle
seems to be also contains some imperfections. After all, as my
father says, “Dogs are only human.” We humans are capable of
wondrous achievements and considerable kindness — but alas, we
are not perfect. We have enough flaws to make us interesting and
then some. So, too, does the wonder-dog we call the Beagle.
Like any dog, a Beagle needs time and attention if he is to become
the dream dog you’re seeking. Feeding, training, and multiple walks
to the pooch potty are among the many tasks you’ll need to per-
form to raise a Beagle well. But Beagles also may pose some breed-
specific challenges. If you’re not prepared to deal with all of those
challenges — general and breed-specific alike — you may find your-
self gritting your teeth at your Snoopy-dog instead of delighting in
his company.
I’ve written Beagles For Dummies so you won’t have to grit your
teeth — at least not very often. Instead, you’ll not only lose
your heart to one of these incredibly adorable creatures, you’ll
also come to appreciate the many wonderful qualities that Beagles
bring to their people.
About This Book
Beagles For Dummies has two reasons for being: first, to be a
people-friendly guide that tells you everything you must know
about this breed; and second, to give you enough information to
decide whether Beagles are, in fact, the breed for you. Between
this book’s covers, you find answers to questions like:
 What are Beagles supposed to look like and how are they sup-
posed to behave?
 Should I choose a puppy or an adult dog? Male or female?

 How do I know that a Beagle breeder is a reputable breeder?
 What do I need to do to survive my Beagle’s first few days at
home? Heck, how do I survive, much less enjoy, his entire
puppyhood?
 How and when should I feed my Beagle?
 What should I teach my Beagle to do? How do I teach him?
What if I can’t teach him anything?
 What health problems is my Beagle likely to have when he’s
young? How about when he grows up — or gets old?
This book answers all of those questions and a whole lot more. The
great thing about this book is that you can find the answers to those
questions and any others in any way you want. If you want to know
everything about living with a Beagle, you may want to begin read-
ing here and continue to the end. But if you have a specific concern,
such as how to keep your Beagle out of the clothes hamper or why
he tends to wander, feel free to skip the preliminaries. Instead, just
scan the Table of Contents or Index and, from there, head to the
pages that tell you exactly what you want to know.

As a writer who specializes in dog topics, I’ve added some conven-
tions of my own. For example, most editors like to refer to dogs in
gender-neutral terms. In other words, unless you’re talking about a
specific dog such as Prince or Princess, you’re supposed to refer to
members of the canine species as it. In this book, I break that rule.
Any dog, even when spayed or neutered, is clearly male or female
and deserves the dignity of being referred to in that manner. For
that reason, I refer to any dog as he, she, him, and her. I alternate
between male and female pronouns in each chapter, using roughly
an equal mix of each pronoun throughout the book. Either way, any
of those pronouns apply to both genders unless I state otherwise. I
also use the word who, not that or which, to refer to our four-legged
friends.

I also like to write the way most people talk, even when the talk
refers to a dog’s bodily wastes. Consequently, I talk about when
dogs poop and pee, not when they do number one and number two,
or tinkle or urinate or defecate. Sometimes I also use the term potty
to refer to bathroom matters. I also don’t favor euphemisms when
discussing important subjects. That’s why I refer to the decision to
end a dog’s life as euthanasia, not putting the dog to sleep.
What You’re Not to Read
This book is full of important, even essential, information to the
would-be or actual Beagle owner, and I’ve assembled that informa-
tion so you can find it easily and understand it the first time you
read it. That said, not all of what you read fits the category of
essential or even important; some falls under the interesting-but-
you-really-don’t-need-to-know-it category. To help you distinguish
between what you must know and what you can do without, I’ve
made the latter easy to recognize. The material in the following list
may be interesting — but if you skip it, you won’t be a deficient
Beagle owner. Promise!
 Text in sidebars: The sidebars are shaded boxes that appear
here and there throughout the book. They contain interesting
tidbits that make you an even better Beagle owner — but if
you skip them, you still know everything you need to know.
 Anything highlighted with a Technical Stuff icon: The infor-
mation in these paragraphs is also interesting, but essential
only if you’re looking to go way, way beyond the basics of
Beagle ownership.
 The stuff on the copyright page: The material on this page
isn’t even interesting, except to the publisher’s legal depart-
ment. Feel free to skip this page unless you’re really into pub-
lishing or copyright law — and in that case, I’m sure you’ll get
more information on the subject somewhere else!
Foolish Assumptions
Every book is aimed at a certain type of reader, and this book is no
exception. In writing this book, I’ve assumed that:
 You’re thinking about adding a Beagle to your family, and you
want to find out more about the breed before making your
final decision.
Introduction

 You can’t decide whether to get a male or female Beagle,
or whether to adopt a young puppy, an older puppy, or an
adult dog.
 Your Beagle will arrive home soon, and you want to know how
to get ready for his homecoming.
 You’ve either never had a Beagle before, or you had one in the
distant past — and, either way, you need to find out as much
as possible about Beagle care in the shortest possible time.
 You already own a Beagle and want some help schooling him
in basics such as housetraining, coming when called, and
sitting when told.
 You’re having trouble training your Beagle, and you need
some guidance to surmount his (and your) learning curve.
How This Book Is Organized
If you read any part of Beagles For Dummies, no matter how small,
you’ll add to your knowledge of how to raise and care for these
wonderful dogs. Here’s how I organized the book to help you live
happily ever after with a Beagle and to deal with any challenges
that come your way.
Part I: Getting to Know Beagles
A decision to open your heart and home to a Beagle shouldn’t be
made in haste. This part tells you what you need to know to choose
your dream dog. You discover the breed’s origins and about how a
healthy Beagle should look and act. You also discover good places
to look for a Beagle and how to evaluate the puppies or dogs you
see when you get there.
Part II: Starting Life
with Your Beagle
Now that you’ve selected the Beagle of your dreams, what do you
do? Part II answers that question by guiding you through the whole
process of preparing for your new dog’s arrival: bringing your
Beagle home and not only surviving, but thriving, during the days
Beagles For Dummies

that follow the homecoming; puppy-proofing your house before
your Beagle arrives; figuring out where your new dog should eat,
sleep, poop, and play; coping with the hectic first day and night;
and starting to bond with your Beagle. It’s all here.
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle
This part covers the nuts and bolts of Beagle care: what and how
to feed your dog; common health issues and how to deal with
them; and how to take great care of your Beagle whether you’re
tending the home fires or out seeing the world. Here you get some
ideas on how to sift through the dizzying array of feeding options
for your dog; how to work with your vet to keep your Beagle
healthy; and what to do when, inevitably, something goes wrong.
Here, too, is where you find information on health conditions that
are common to Beagles.
Part IV: Training Your Beagle
Charlie Brown may have said, “Happiness is a warm puppy,” but
when that puppy is a Beagle, happiness also is a trained Beagle. You
are your Beagle’s first and best teacher, and in this part you find the
information and direction you need to mold your four-legged friend
into a model citizen. You find out how to teach your Beagle proper
potty protocol, which is a crucial component to living happily ever
after with one of these dogs. You also discover how to teach basic
commands and what you can do if your Beagle proves to be a chal-
lenging student. Also included are pointers on how to work with
experts such as dog trainers and animal behaviorists.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Here’s where you find information that provides extra hints
on how to keep your Beagle healthy and happy and describes
common mistakes that Beagle owners make. In addition, a final
chapter lists some interesting facts about how Beagles — canine
and otherwise — affect our lives.
Finally, if you want additional resources that provide more informa-
tion about Beagles, I’ve included an appendix chock full of infor-
mation and ideas at the very end of the book.

Icons Used in This Book
To help you find particular kinds of information as you read this
book, keep your eyes peeled for the following icons:
This icon appears whenever an idea or item can save you time,
money, or stress when taking care of your Beagle.
Any time you see this icon, you know the information that follows
is so important that it’s worth reading more than once.

Where to Go from Here
You can read this book any way you choose. If you want to jump-
start your knowledge of all things Beagle, start at the beginning and
continue through to the end. On the other hand, if you need to read
up on just a couple of specific issues, mosey on over to the Table of
Contents or to the Index to determine exactly where to find the
information you need. For example, if you already have your Beagle
and need to teach him to do his business outside rather than inside,
head to Chapter 14. On the other hand, if you’re still trying to decide
whether to get a Beagle, check out Chapters 1 and 2.
Finally, this book is meant to be a reference manual and guide, but
it doesn’t replace the advice that veterinarians, trainers, and
behaviorists can give in person after they work with you and your
one-of-a-kind dog. If the suggestions here don’t work for you or
your Beagle, or if you can’t find an answer to a particular question
in this book, don’t hesitate to consult any of these professionals.

S
o you’re thinking of adding a Beagle to your life? Good
for you! Life with these little hounds can lead to years
of merriment, entertainment, and love — if you do your
homework beforehand. Part I gives you all the information
you need to make sure that the Beagle is the right breed
for you and advice on choosing your own very special
Beagle soul mate.

Beagles and You:
Made for Each Other?
In This Chapter
 Appreciating the Beagle’s nature
 Discovering what Beagles need from their people
 Comparing Beagle pluses and minuses
 Making the decision
W
ho can resist a Beagle? Those floppy ears, soulful eyes, and
irrepressible good spirits can melt the heart of the most
stone-cold human being on the planet. Even better, they’re low
maintenance — as least when you compare them to long-haired
breeds, such as Afghan Hounds, Golden Retrievers, and Collies.
But despite their many great qualities, Beagles aren’t necessarily
for everyone. To determine whether the Beagle is your dream dog,
you need to know much more about the breed. This chapter sum-
marizes the many advantages that Beagles offer to the wannabe
dog owner, and also describes what Beagles need to live happily
ever after with you.
Ain’t Nothin’ but a Hound Dog
The American Kennel Club (AKC), which is the number-one arbiter
of dog breeds in the United States, recognizes more than 150
breeds. To make more sense of these various manifestations of
Canis familiaris, the AKC has developed seven breed classifica-
tions, or groups. The breeds within each group generally have simi-
lar origins and talents, although they may not all look very much
like each other.
The Beagle belongs to the AKC Hound Group. That’s because
although any dog of any breed has a far better sense of smell than
any human, the hound breeds have the best sniffers of all. Those

noses enable hounds to be excellent hunters, and they can do their
hunting without getting very much direction from their human
partners. Many hounds, such as Greyhounds and Scottish
Deerhounds, have great eyesight, too.
Physically and temperamentally, hounds are a pretty diverse
group. Some breeds are sweet and mellow, others are feisty, and
still others are somewhat aloof. Some, like the Afghan Hound, are
quite large. Others, like the Dachshund, are notably short in
stature. Coat types range from short and hard to long and soft,
with a lot of variation in between. Still, most hounds are happy to
curl up with you and share the love if they’ve had sufficient exer-
cise and attention. And unlike some breeds that act as though
they’re the canine embodiments of Velcro, hounds are relatively
independent. Occasionally they need their space — and if you
sometimes need your space, they understand and give it to you.
Within the Hound kingdom, the Beagle is the court jester. He’s a
merry little dog who keeps everyone in stitches. He’s a sociable
fellow who enjoys company without getting neurotic. And he can
be plenty mischievous, not to mention sufficiently independent to
get into that mischief from beyond your immediate purview.

The Beagle’s Bill of Rights
Just like the American colonists back at the time of the
Revolutionary War, every Beagle has certain inalienable rights —
needs that must be fulfilled in order to have a happy life with you.
Most of these needs are pretty basic, and no less than what you’d
want for yourself. In other words, a little empathy from you should
result in a lot of comfort and joy for your Snoopy-dog. That empa-
thy should help you realize that Beagles and all other dogs need
and deserve the things described in the following sections.
Lots of love
Beagles are relatively independent dogs, but they’re also very
social creatures. That means that a Beagle may have his own
agenda, but that agenda almost always includes hanging out with
his people as often as possible. He’s not necessarily a stick-to-your-
side dog, but he certainly wants to be part of any action that’s
going on within his household. If you’re looking for an aloof pooch
who prefers solitude to companionship, the Beagle is not for you.
Safe shelter
As Chapter 2 explains, Beagles were originally bred to hunt rabbits,
but the typical pet Beagle doesn’t get much opportunity to chase
down bunnies (probably much to the bunnies’ relief!). For that
reason, today’s Beagle isn’t meant to live a life in a yard, a dog-
house, or an outdoor kennel. He should live in your house with
you, and be part of your family.
That said, keeping your Beagle in your house can be a challenging
enterprise. The little hound’s sense of humor may not always be
to your liking; he has an uncanny ability to ferret out stuff that you
don’t want him to have (lingerie, anyone?). Chapter 5 contains lots
of suggestions on how to make your home a great place for a
Beagle and also limit his ability to make mischief.
Food, glorious food
Beagles are relatively small, so you don’t need to worry about your
canine companion running up a humongous food bill. Still your
little hound does need enough nutritious food to keep his skin
pink, his coat healthy, and his physique sleek. Chapter 8 explains
not only what to feed your Beagle, but also how to feed him so he
reaps the maximum possible benefit from every meal.
Chapter 1: Beagles and You: Made for Each Other? 11

Room to run (preferably with you)
Like other dogs that were bred to hunt, the Beagle has a prodigious
amount of energy — even though he’s pretty small for a hunting
dog. Unless you’re giving your dog regular chances to chase down
rabbits, you need to provide him with other opportunities to exer-
cise. A couple of brisk, 20-minute walks each day can keep his mus-
cles toned (not to mention what such strolls may do for your own
health!), but don’t limit yourself to twice-daily turns around your
block. Head on over to Chapter 9 to find ways to be active that
both you and your little hound will love.
A touch of class(es)
All dogs need some training, and the Beagle is no exception. For one
thing, the trained Beagle is probably a lot happier than his untrained
counterpart. The unschooled dog makes lots of mistakes, such as
messing in the house, jumping up on people, and trashing house-
hold goods, but doesn’t understand why his people are always
angry at him. How would you feel if someone you depended on was
angry at you, and you had no idea why? Probably pretty miserable.
The same is true of the clueless, untrained Beagle.
By contrast, the trained Beagle has a much better time of fitting in
with his family. Because he knows that he’s not supposed to take a
whiz on the white Berber carpet in the living room, he’ll never get
scolded for doing so. Because he understands that he’s not sup-
posed to become a canine pogo stick and jump all over his people,
those people are happy to get down to his level and interact with
him. The Beagle is a born extrovert, so all this positive interaction
can’t help but make him happy.
And he’s not the only one who’s happy — the people in the trained
Beagle’s life are happy, too. They have a family member who’s a
pleasure to be around and who doesn’t cause undue stress. They
don’t have to worry about their Snoopy-dog growling at strangers,
snapping at anyone who comes near his favorite toy, or finding an
unwelcome little deposit atop their favorite easy chair. People with
trained dogs are free to truly enjoy their dogs. A trained dog is a
true companion, a friend in the best sense of the word.
Finally, the trained Beagle also is more likely to be safe than his
untrained counterpart. That’s because a Beagle with basic obedi-
ence training will know how to come when he’s called, stop doing
something when told to do so, and perform other maneuvers that
can help keep him out of trouble.
Part I: Getting to Know Beagles 
12

Part IV gives you the scoop on how to transform your clueless
little hound into a well-mannered Beagle, and how to deal with a
dog who’s got one or more challenging behavioral issues. Also
included is information not only on how to train your Beagle your-
self, but also on how to choose an obedience instructor and to
choose among training options.
Great health care
Beagles generally are very healthy dogs — but like all dogs (and,
for that matter, people), they need good medical care to stay that
way. Providing such care is a two-pronged effort that consists of:
 Preventing illness: You and your veterinarian work together
to keep all of your Beagle’s systems functioning at optimal
levels. Such care includes regular checkups, immunizations
when necessary, determining your Beagle’s reproductive
future, and getting a handle on how your Beagle looks and
acts when he’s healthy. Chapter 11 addresses all these issues
and more.
 Treating illness or injury: You and your vet work in partner-
ship to help your Beagle recover from any illness or injury he
sustains. Chapter 12 outlines symptoms that require an emer-
gency visit to your veterinarian or emergency clinic, those
that require a phone call to your vet, and which ones should-
n’t cause you any worry. Chapter 11 gives you the lowdown
on how to care for your dog after the visit to the vet, including
a primer on dispensing any medication the vet prescribes.
Although Beagles generally enjoy good health, they are more vul-
nerable to certain conditions than other dogs are. Chapter 12 out-
lines those conditions and describes how you and your vet can
resolve them.
Good grooming
Unlike other dogs, especially those with long hair, Beagles need rel-
atively little grooming. However, “little grooming” does not mean
the same thing as “no grooming”! The Beagle does require certain
sprucing-up rituals to look and feel his best. Among those rituals:
daily tooth brushing, weekly coat brushing, a monthly bath, peri-
odic ear cleaning and nail trims, and ongoing efforts to keep his
coat free from parasites such as fleas and ticks. Chapter 10 offers a
primer on how to groom your Beagle.
Chapter 1: Beagles and You: Made for Each Other? 13

Why Beagles Are Wonderful
Beagles don’t win the breed popularity contest, but they come
darn close. The American Kennel Club reports that in 2005, the
most recent year for which figures are available, Beagles were the
fifth-most popular of the AKC’s 154 recognized breeds. Only
Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, Yorkshire Terriers, and
German Shepherd Dogs drew more registrations than the Beagle
did. The little hound has been consistently popular over several
decades — in fact, the breed was number one in registrations from
1953 through 1959.
What’s behind the Beagle’s appeal? Probably several factors: For
starters, they’re cute; they’re small; and they’re easy to groom.
Other pluses are that most Beagles are multitalented, supersociable,
and get along well with children.
Hop on over to Chapter 2 to get more info on why so many people
choose to share their lives with one or more Beagles. You’ll also
discover the Beagle’s European ancestry and get the lowdown on
what a Snoopy-dog is supposed to look like.
Buyer’s Remorse: Why a Beagle
May Not Be Your Dream Dog
As wonderful as Beagles are, they’re not for everybody. In the
interest of objectivity, it’s only fair that I outline some of the chal-
lenges of trying to live happily ever after with one of these little
hounds.
Among the Beagle’s less-than-sterling attributes is his occasional
stubbornness — in fact, without training, the Beagle can be down-
right ornery if his priorities conflict with yours. Part IV helps you
counteract this independence — or at least channel it in another
direction — by giving you detailed suggestions on how to civilize
your little hound. I pay special attention to a frequent complaint
from Beagle owners — that their dogs frequently flunk potty
training — by devoting an entire chapter (Chapter 14) to
housetraining.
Another possible problem that Beagle ownership may pose is that
the dog’s short, hard coat is practically guaranteed to worsen any
airborne allergies that a person has. If dog hair makes you sneeze,
a Beagle’s presence may turn you into a sneezing machine.
Part I: Getting to Know Beagles 
14

Another possible downside is the breed’s, well, mouthiness.
Beagles are vocal creatures, and are not shy about expressing
themselves in a regular dog bark or in that unique form of song
known as howling. They are hounds, after all, and hounds do howl.
Chapter 2 explains what you may not like about Beagles, so you
can make an objective decision about whether this breed is the
right one for you and your family.
What to Ask Yourself
The best way to determine whether you’re ready to welcome a
Beagle into your life is to ask yourself questions that help you
assess your needs and the dog’s needs, and determine whether
those two sets of priorities are compatible. This section offers
points to ponder as you make this crucial decision.
Why do I want a Beagle?
Be sure that the reasons you want a Beagle result from your knowl-
edge of the breed and yourself, not from misconceptions or will-o-
the-wisp whims. Think about the issues in the following sections.
What do I like about Beagles?
Maybe you’re interested in Snoopy-dogs because you grew up with
one, and your memories of that dog are warm, fuzzy, and soft-
focus. But it’s important to remember that childhood memories
don’t tell the whole story of life with an individual dog.
That Beagle you loved also may have driven your mother crazy, per-
haps because the dog never learned basic bathroom manners. And
even if that Beagle was housetrained (to your mom’s understand-
able relief), that dog was a unique individual. You probably will
never find a Beagle who’s quite like him — nor should you try to.
Or maybe you’ve met your neighbor’s Beagle and adore that dog’s
friendly, outgoing personality. However, that dog not only has his
own one-of-a-kind temperament, but also probably has had more
than a little training and positive exposure to people. To help your
Beagle be as sociable as your neighbor’s, you’ll need to put in lots
of time to teach him basic manners and help him learn that the
world can be a friendly place.
Chapter 2 tells you more about Beagle traits, and Chapter 7
explains how to socialize your Beagle. Part IV discusses how to
make your Beagle a good canine citizen.
Chapter 1: Beagles and You: Made for Each Other? 15

Who is this dog for?
Only two answers to this question are okay: “for me” or “for me
and my family.” In other words, no Beagle or other dog should be
a gift — and please don’t bestow a Beagle on another person as a
surprise. Chances are, that surprise or gift will not be welcome.
Unless you know that the recipient is dying to have a dog and is
prepared to care for one, give an inanimate gift, such as a plush
Beagle or other stuffed animal, instead.
And please don’t get a Beagle “for the kids” unless you, the parent,
are prepared to take full responsibility for the dog’s care. Little kids
generally are too young and irresponsible to care for a dog prop-
erly. Older kids and teens may have the necessary maturity, but
they don’t have the necessary time. I’m lucky if my own teenage
daughter has the time to walk our dog one night a week.
Fortunately, I adore our dog and am his main caregiver — so my
daughter’s lack of time to help out isn’t an issue.
Have I recently lost a dog?
Living with a dog, no matter how wonderful he is, carries a major
downside: He will probably die before you do. And when he does,
the loss leaves a huge hole in your life — and in your heart. The
same is true if your dog is simply lost and hasn’t returned, or if you
had to relinquish the dog to a shelter or somewhere else because
you could no longer live with the dog. At such times, it’s natural to
want to fill those holes with a new canine companion. By doing so,
you hope to staunch the flow of grief that’s flowing from your soul.
But unless you’ve come to terms with your loss, hold off on adding
a new dog to your life. If you’re still angry or grieving over the dog
who’s no longer here, you’ll have a hard time forming a bond with
the dog who’s arrived. Any dog deserves to have a person who
loves him without qualification. If you’re still coping with the loss
of an earlier canine companion, bonding with a new dog can be all
but impossible.
No animal can replace another. Each dog, whether he’s a Beagle or
any other breed, is a unique individual and deserves to be appreci-
ated as such. If you’re still processing the loss of your previous
pooch, you’re not going to appreciate the special qualities a new
dog will bring to your life. For both your sake and the new dog’s,
hold off on bringing that dog into your life until your sadness and
anger over the loss of the previous dog give way to happy memo-
ries. I promise you that change will happen — in time.
Part I: Getting to Know Beagles 
16

If you had to relinquish a dog to a shelter or rescue group because
the dog had behavioral problems, or if you had problems that
made dog ownership impossible, make sure all such issues are
resolved before you bring a new dog into your life. Otherwise, the
issues that doomed your relationship with Dog No. 1 are likely to
recur with Dog No. 2.
Do I have commitment issues?
A Beagle has a pretty good life expectancy for a dog: 10 to 14 years
on average, and in some cases, even longer. If you add a puppy to
your household, you’re looking at more than a decade of care; with
an older dog, your time together will be shorter, but the care you
need to give will be the same. A Beagle from a shelter or rescue
group may need even more care. Such dogs may have behavioral
problems because they were mistreated or abandoned.
In any case, before you take any dog into your heart and home, you
need to be sure that you can commit yourself to the animal for his
entire lifetime. Consider the following questions:
Have I been thinking about getting a dog for a while?
You shouldn’t add a dog to your life on impulse. If you’ve suddenly
seen a dog whom you want to adopt immediately, slow down. Unless
you’ve pondered whether you’re ready for a dog and whether you
can care for that dog properly, you need to wait. No dog deserves
to be stuck with a person who’s made a hasty decision that she
regrets — or, worse, to be abandoned or relinquished to a shelter
because that impulsive person decided that she didn’t want a dog
after all.
Have I thought about how a dog will change my life?
When you welcome a dog into your home, your life changes. Gone
are the days when you can leave the office at 5 or later and head
over to the local watering hole to schmooze with friends or col-
leagues — not when you have a dog who’s sitting at home waiting
to be fed, taken out, and played with after being home alone all
day. Gone, too, are the days when you can sleep in on Saturday
morning or stay inside on a rainy evening — not when you have a
pooch who needs to potty outside at those times.
Your dog will need your care and attention every single day of his
life — if not from you directly, then from someone trustworthy when
you can’t be there. From now on, any plans you make must take into
account not just what you want, but also what your dog needs.
Chapter 1: Beagles and You: Made for Each Other? 17

Am I willing to put a dog’s needs ahead of my own desires?
A dog depends on you not only for basic care, but also for love and
companionship — and you need to put that dependent individual’s
needs ahead of what you may want. Ignore those needs and you’re
likely to have a very neurotic dog.
I learned this lesson one long-ago summer when, as a single, dog-
owning woman living in a city, I rented a share in a beach house
that was located several hours’ drive from my home. Every other
weekend, I’d head to the beach house and board my dog in a local
kennel. Within a month or so, Molly had become very skittish and
would start freaking out whenever I was out of her sight, even
when I went to the bathroom. (She’d cry outside the closed bath-
room door.) I realized that between my being at work all day and
being away on the weekends, Molly was literally crying for my
attention. Her need for me was clear, so I ended my beach week-
ends. Molly was much happier — and, in the end, so was I.
Is my home good for a Beagle?
The Beagle is a highly adaptable fellow, but not even a Snoopy-
dog is suitable for each and every home. To determine whether
your home is Beagle-friendly or even Beagle-neutral, consider the
following:
Do I already have a dog?
Neither a “yes” nor a “no” automatically means that your domicile
isn’t suitable for a Beagle. But if you do have a dog, and that dog is
large, you may have a problem. That’s because in the inevitable
jockeying for top-dog position that will ensue when your Beagle
hits the scene — a jockeying that could include growls, snarls, and
wrestling matches that rival the WWE’s SmackDown — a larger dog
is likely to win, no matter how feisty your Beagle is. The best your
Beagle can hope for is to escape uninjured.
In general, you’re better off if both dogs are of the same approxi-
mate size and of opposite genders. Even then, however, you need
to supervise the introductions and make sure the two dogs learn to
get along. Chapter 6 describes how to introduce your new Beagle
to any other canine members of your household.
What about my kids?
Beagles usually get along well with kids, assuming that the kids
know how to treat a dog properly. But in too many families, that
isn’t the case. If your children are under the age of 6, think twice
Part I: Getting to Know Beagles 
18

about getting a Beagle or any other dog. Hop on over to Chapter 6
for suggestions on how to help your Beagle and your kids become
best friends.
Do I live in an apartment?
A Beagle will not endear you to your neighbors if he gives in to his
urge to howl. Think twice about bringing a Beagle into such close
quarters. Your neighbors will be grateful.
Do I spend much time at home?
No one says that your Beagle needs to have you around 24/7, but
this very social pooch will be much happier if you or someone else
is around for at least part of the day. If you’re the sort who’s on
the go outside your home from the break of dawn until the dead
of night, you may have a hard time fitting a Beagle — or any other
dog — into your life.
Can I afford a Beagle?
Dog ownership doesn’t come cheap. Beyond the upfront cost of
buying or adopting the dog, you take on plenty of other expenses
when you welcome a dog into your family. Here’s what you can
expect to pay for over your Beagle’s lifetime:
 The dog: No matter where you get your Beagle — from a shel-
ter, a rescue group, or a reputable breeder — you’ll have to
part with some cash to bring that dog home. In mid-2006, the
Beagle rescue group in my area charged a $200 adoption fee to
cover the cost of that Beagle’s care in a foster home, spaying
or neutering, and a microchip implant, among other expenses.
A nearby animal shelter charged $100 to $300 to adopt a dog,
depending on the animal’s size. A reputable breeder is likely
to charge several hundred dollars for a puppy, particularly if
the pup is a show prospect. Chapter 3 outlines where you
should look for the Beagle of your dreams — and where you
shouldn’t look, too.
 Supplies: You’ll need to lay in some Beagle equipment before
you acquire your Beagle: for starters, a crate, dishes, groom-
ing gear, collar, leash, food, and toys. Chapter 5 tells you
everything you need to buy for Beagle before he comes home.
 Medical care: Every Beagle needs a yearly wellness exam, as
well as periodic immunizations against various diseases. And
unless you plan to breed your Beagle, you’ll also have to pay
for the dog to be spayed or neutered — unless you adopt a
rescue or shelter dog who’s already been fixed. Additional
Chapter 1: Beagles and You: Made for Each Other? 19

expenses will result when your Beagle gets sick and needs
expert attention. Chapters 7 and 11 describe how you can work
with your vet to keep your Beagle in the pink, and Chapter 12
discusses how to cope if your dog becomes ill or injured.
 Travel expenses: If you travel, you need to consider the costs
of taking your Beagle with you or leaving him home. Chapter 13
covers the pro’s and con’s of either option.
A Final Thought
If you’ve thought carefully about why you want a Beagle, concluded
that your domicile would be perfect for a little hound, determined
that you will be a great parent and companion to a Snoopy-dog, and
know that you can deal with the challenges this breed presents, con-
gratulations! You’ve decided to add a wonderful dog to your life.
However, your decision-making is far from over. Now you need to
determine whether you want a male or female Beagle; whether you
want a puppy, young adult, or senior pooch; and where you want
to start looking for your future companion. You also need to arm
yourself with info on what to look for when evaluating the Beagles
you meet. The rest of Part I will give you the scoop on how to find
the Beagle who’s just right for you.

o question about it: If we were to rate the various dog breeds
for cuteness and adorability on a scale of 1 to 10, the Beagle
would probably score a 15. The dog’s huge and winsome eyes, soft
and floppy ears, and snuggle-able size appeal enormously to
humans of all ages.
But the Beagle is much more than a saucer-eyed canine love
object. Like so many other breeds, the Beagle originated to work
with people to perform one or more specific tasks for the benefit of
human beings. In this chapter, I discuss what those tasks were,
how the Beagle helped to accomplish them, and how the Beagle’s
history affects the breed today.
Mommy, Where Do Beagles
Come From?
Determining the Beagle’s origins is a tricky proposition — mainly
because historians don’t agree as to when the very first Beagles
appeared. Some claim that the ancient Greeks bred small hounds
for the purpose of hunting rabbits many hundreds of years before
the birth of Christ. Others maintain that the breed’s ancestry dates
from around 200 A.D.

But while scholars may disagree as to when the little hound first
appeared on the scene, those who study Beagle history do seem to
agree that the ancestors of the Beagles we know today developed
in England as early as the 1300s to hunt hares. In fact, in the pro-
logue to The Canterbury Tales, the 13th century author Geoffrey
Chaucer describes a prioress, or nun, who had “small houndes . . .
that she fed with roasted flesh, and milk, and wastel bread.”
However, the breed name didn’t appear in print until at least a cen-
tury later. The known debut of the name Beagle in the English lan-
guage was in 1475, in a story called The Squire of Low Degree. The
author, who is unknown, wrote, “With theyr begles in that place
and seven-score raches [small French hounds] at his rechase . . .”
By the time Elizabeth I ascended the British throne in 1558, many
British nobles liked to hunt rabbits with the help of pocket Beagles:
very small hunting hounds that measured only 9 inches tall at the
shoulder. (By comparison, today’s Beagles are supposed to meas-
ure between 13 and 15 inches.)
Although these diminutive hounds pursued their long-eared quarry
with great enthusiasm, the rise of fox hunting — which most
nobles found far more exciting than hunting rabbits or hares —
required hounds that were bigger and faster than the pocket
Beagle. Consequently, by the mid-1700s, the popularity of Beagles
among the English nobility declined in favor of a dog that is the
ancestor of today’s Foxhound, a dog that is considerably larger
than any Beagle, pocket-sized or otherwise.
But in the 1800s, the British began to regain their interest in 
hunting with Beagles. Under the leadership of the Reverend Philip
Honeywood, among others, the British began to develop fine hunt-
ing packs of Beagles. At the same time, many dog fanciers in England
began to show their canine stock in events designed to build inter-
est in breeding the dogs being shown. These events were the first
conformation dog shows, which live today in such well-known

What’s in the name?
The origin of the term Beagle is as mysterious as the origin of the breed itself. Some
dictionaries credit the French with coining the term be’guele to denote an open
mouth — perhaps a reference to the breed’s ability to howl. Other sources suggest
that the breed’s name derived from the French term begle, Celtic term beag, or the
Old English begele. All three terms mean small — which is appropriate, consider-
ing the breed’s small size.

gatherings as England’s Crufts show and the American Westminster
Kennel Club dog show. To provide a vehicle for showing Beagles, a
group of British enthusiasts formed The Beagle Club in 1890.
Meanwhile, across the Atlantic Ocean, Beagles were earning their
keep in American households by hunting game and thus helping
to put food on American tables. But by the mid-19th century,
Americans were becoming just as interested in dog shows as their
counterparts on the other side of the pond.
Some Americans began importing high-quality British Beagles, and
by 1884 — the same year that the American Kennel Club (AKC)
formed (see the “Just what is the AKC, anyway?” sidebar) — these
enthusiasts had formed the American-English Beagle Club to
exhibit their dogs in conformation shows. At the same time,
though, another group of enthusiasts formed the National Beagle
Club (NBC) of America to not only improve the Beagle’s looks but
also its ability to hunt game. By the end of the 19th century, the
two clubs had merged into one organization dedicated to improv-
ing the breed’s performance in the show ring and in the field.
Although some of today’s Beagles have earned accolades as both
conformation champions and field champions, many continue to
excel in either one venue or the other. As I explain in Chapter 4,
these differences are crucial considerations in what sort of Beagle
companion you should search for and select.
Chapter 2: The Incredible, Lovable Beagle 23
Just what is the AKC, anyway?
The American Kennel Club (AKC), headquartered in New York City and Raleigh,
North Carolina, records data and statistics for the 154 dog breeds — including the
Beagle — that the club considers to be purebred. Among the info the club gathers
are births of litters, registrations of individual dogs, and titles that dogs earn in events
such as dog shows, agility trials, and competitive obedience.
But the AKC is more than just a registry. The organization also sponsors all kinds of
events at which dogs earn those titles. These events include not only the three types
listed above, but also such varied activities as tracking competitions, herding tests,
and hunting trials. Although the AKC serves as a sponsor, the actual events are held
by clubs that belong to the AKC, such as the National Beagle Club of America.
The AKC also tries to promote responsible dog breeding and ownership through
education programs targeted to breeders and owners. The organization tries to
spread the word on good breeding practices, but it doesn’t have any enforcement
or endorsement powers. A puppy with AKC papers is simply a puppy registered with
the AKC. The papers don’t guarantee a dog’s health or temperament.

The Official Beagle Blueprint
Although Beagles have been around in one form or another for
quite awhile, the Snoopy-dog that most people are familiar with is
only a little more than a century old. That dog’s adorable face,
tenacious personality, awesome scent-sniffing ability, and obses-
sion with bunnies didn’t happen by accident — trust me, no hot
doggy love and subsequent surprise puppies occurred here!
Today’s best Beagles, like all high-quality purebred dogs, result
from breedings that are carefully planned by human beings.
Why all the care in planning? Because human beings want Beagles
to have a certain look and temperament. In fact, the National
Beagle Club of America developed a multipage set of specifications
that describe in precise detail what a perfect Beagle should look
and act like. (Likewise, all other national breed clubs produce simi-
lar specifications for their respective breeds.) This blueprint for a
Beagle, which is called the breed standard, outlines what reputable
breeders should try to produce in their Beagle puppies and what
judges should look for when they assess Beagles in the conforma-
tion show ring. The breed standard puts into words what a picture
such as Figure 2-1 shows: the ideal Beagle.
Figure 2-1: Highlights of the Beagle breed standard.
The following sections describe the breed standard developed by
the National Beagle Club and recognized by the AKC.

General appearance
The AKC standard specifies that a Beagle should resemble a minia-
ture Foxhound that is solid and big for his inches, with the wear-
and-tear look of a hound that can last in the chase and follow his
quarry to the death. In other words, the ideal Beagle can look cute,
but he shouldn’t look frail or delicate. He should embody the look
of a solid dog who will chase a rabbit or other quarry until the
quarry gives up, wears out, and/or gets caught.
The standard also notes that Beagles come in two sizes: the 13-inch
Beagle and the 15-inch Beagle. The 13-incher is supposed to be no
taller than 13 inches at the front shoulder. Similarly, the 15-inch
Beagle should not exceed 15 inches in height at the front shoulder.
Specific parts
Of course, the standard does much more than offer a big-picture
description of what a Beagle should look like. The standard places
far more emphasis on exactly how specific parts of the Beagle’s
body should appear.
Chapter 2: The Incredible, Lovable Beagle 25
Decoding the breed standard
If you decide to read the actual breed standard approved by the National Beagle
Club of America, you may encounter some puzzling terms. Here are definitions of the
terms that are most likely to cause confusion:
 Cow hocks: A condition in which the hind legs turn in on each other. Cow hocks
and the opposite condition, divergent hocks, may affect the dog’s ability to move
properly.
 Forelegs: The front legs.
 Loin: The area on each side of the backbone between the ribs and the hips.
 Occipital: The bone at the back of the top of the skull. In some dogs, this bone
is quite prominent, even triangular-looking.
 Rib spring: The width of the chest.
 Stop: An indentation at the midpoint of the face. A definite stop refers to a clear,
distinct indentation between the top half and bottom half of the face.
 Withers: The shoulders. Most measurements of a dog’s height are from the floor
to the top of the withers.

If you plan on showing your Beagle, log onto the AKC Web site at
www.akc.org/breeds/beagle, where you can find a copy of the
actual breed standard.
Head
A Beagle’s skull should be fairly long, with a slight dome at the
back part of the head. The skull as a whole should be relatively
broad and full, not elongated. Those long, silky ears should reach
almost to the end of the nose if drawn out straight, and they
should be rounded at the tips. The eyes should be hazel or brown
in color and should be large, set far apart, and have a gentle, plead-
ing expression. The muzzle should have a square shape, and the
profile should show a clear distinction between the bottom of the
face and top of the face.
Body
Wrinkles are OK for Chinese Shar-pei but not for Beagles! The stan-
dard stipulates that the neck and throat should not exhibit any skin
folds. The shoulders should not be upright; rather, they should
slope downward. The dog’s chest should be deep and broad but not
out of proportion to the rest of the body. The Beagle’s back should
be relatively short (no channeling of Dachshunds here!).
Legs, feet, and tail
The wiener dog takes another hit when the Beagle breed standard
addresses legs, feet, and tails. The standard stipulates that a
Beagle’s front legs should be straight, not crooked or — yes, the
standard gets this specific — resembling the front legs of a
Dachshund. The hips and thighs should be strong and muscular.
The tail needs to be fairly high on the rump and carried in a jaunty
fashion, but it should not curve over the back.
Coat and color
The Beagle should have a medium-length, easy-to-groom coat that
lies close to the body and is hard to the touch. Silky tresses are a
definite no-no.
As for coat color, the standard is vague, saying only that any recog-
nized hound color is OK. The most common color is the black,
white, and tan tri-color, but other colors common to hounds such
as red and white, chocolate tri-color (solid chocolate brown instead
of black), and shaded tri-color (varied shades of brown instead of
black) are OK, too. So, too, is ticking: tiny spots of brown or black in
white fur.

26

Defects
The standard also discusses how judges should rate the less-than-
perfect Beagle. Among the defects that would cause a judge to
disqualify a dog from or deduct points in the show ring are the
following:
 Height exceeding 15 inches
 A narrow skull
 A cranium that’s too high
 Small eyes
 Protruding eyes
 Excessively short ears
 Ears set too high on the head
 Ears that rise from their point of origin before falling
 Excessive skin folding at the throat
 Straight shoulders
 Excessively deep or shallow chest
 Swayed or excessively long back
 Cow hocks
 Excessively long tail
 A tail curved forward or over the dog’s back
 Lack of feathering at the end of the tail
 Soft coat
 Thin coat
Few, if any, Beagles meet all the standard’s criteria for perfection.
Some deficiencies are no big deal in the show ring, while others are
considered so serious that the dog can’t be shown. Still, disqualifi-
cation from the show ring certainly doesn’t mean that the affected
Beagle won’t be a wonderful, healthy pet or participant in other
dog activities. Plenty of Beagles who don’t make the grade in con-
formation can earn straight A’s as lively, loving companions — and
more. Chapter 3 describes in greater detail how wannabe pet
owners can find the Beagle of their dreams by buying or adopting
the Snoopy-dog who would never make Westminster.
Chapter 2: The Incredible, Lovable Beagle 27

Why the World Loves Beagles
Every year, the AKC tallies up the number of dogs registered for
each of the breeds the organization currently recognizes — and
each year, Beagles pups and litters are among the breeds that
garner the most registrations. For example, in 2005 — the last year
for which registration stats were available at the time I was writing
this book — the Beagle bagged the number 5 position out of 154
breeds. Only Yorkshire Terriers, German Shepherd Dogs, Golden
Retrievers, and Labrador Retrievers drew more registrations.
That’s not a fluke, either; the Beagle has held its own among the
big dogs (and the Yorkie, too) for many years.
And it’s easy to see why. Beagles offer something for almost every-
one, including the following:
 They’re adorable. Few people can resist the winsome eyes,
soft muzzle, and all-around cuteness of a Beagle. Just one
soulful gaze from this sweet-looking little hound is enough
to render almost any dog lover totally smitten. And just one
day with this happy-go-lucky little dog (the eyes may look
sad, but the rest of the dog is happy, happy, happy) may well
hook you for life.
 They’re low-maintenance. With a Beagle, you don’t have to
worry about untangling the coat, creating a canine top-knot,
or booking an appointment with the local groomer. Beagles
do need bathing and brushing, as well as ear tending, puppy
pedicures, and tooth care, but you can easily perform all
those functions yourself — especially with the help of the
tips included in Chapter 10.
Part I: Getting to Know Beagles 
28
Fashion tips for the owner
The Beagle breed standard, unlike many other standards, also describes proper
attire for the fashion-conscious owner. The recommended ensemble applies only to
those owners who participate in formal hunts with packs of Beagles. Among the
suggested clothes are green coats and white breeches or knickerbockers for men.
Women should substitute white skirts for the breeches. Both sexes should acces-
sorize their ensembles with a black velvet cap, white tie, green or black stockings,
white spats, and black or dark brown shoes. Vest and gloves are optional.

 They’re small. The pocket Beagle may have been a
Renaissance fad, but today’s Beagle is still pretty compact.
That small size makes this breed ideal for people who can’t
or don’t want to deal with the logistics of caring for larger
dogs. (Believe me: Getting an 80-pound canine to get into the
bathtub or out of the car when that dog would rather do some-
thing else can be, um, challenging.) And if your leashed Beagle
decides to make like a sled dog and pull you down the street
while the two of you are walking, your size advantage can put a
quick stop to such behavior. That said, Chapter 15 includes
pointers on teaching your Beagle good walking manners, and
using brute strength isn’t one of my recommendations.
 They’re versatile. Beagles are truly multitalented individuals.
As Chapter 9 shows, they not only can excel in the conforma-
tion ring but also in activities such as competitive obedience,
agility, and flyball. Their superb noses make them natural 
trackers — and of course, they can write the book on hunting
small game. But the Beagle’s potential doesn’t stop with these
traditional dog activities. Hop on over to Chapter 19 to dis-
cover how Beagles serve on the front lines of the war on terror
and also are first-class detectors of hidden mold and termites.
 They’re sociable. Simply put, Beagles enjoy the company of
human beings. They relish meeting and greeting just about
any person. Beagles not only fit well into human families but
also can employ their friendliness in another pursuit: as ther-
apy dogs. These canine healers visit sick people in hospitals
and elderly people who are confined to nursing homes. In fact,
one of the best known therapy dogs of recent years was a
Beagle. Her name was Dani, and she not only gave lots of
canine TLC to pediatric cancer patients but also provided a
lesson in courage to those patients when she was diagnosed
with cancer herself. Fortunately, Dani survived her bout with
the big C and continued her therapy duties. You may not want
to perform therapy work with your dog, but Chapter 7 offers
tips for bringing out the extrovert in any Beagle.
 They’re kid-friendly. Some breeds do better with children
than others — and the Beagle is among those canines that can
be wonderful companions for kids. The Beagle is small enough
to be able to romp with children without knocking them over,
but large and sturdy enough to interact with sometimes-
clumsy kids with relative safety. Still, to minimize the likeli-
hood of either kid or canine getting hurt when getting
together, Chapter 7 provides information on how to help
Beagles and children live happily ever after.
Chapter 2: The Incredible, Lovable Beagle 29

. . . But Nobody’s Perfect
Alas, as wonderful and appealing as the Beagle can be, the breed
also has its dark side. Consider the following possible disadvan-
tages of living with Snoopy-dogs:
 They are vocal. All dogs bark, but the Beagle adds a little
something extra to his vocal repertoire: the howl. A Snoopy-
dog who lifts his head in Beagle-song will certainly get the
attention of the people around him — and, if he lives in an
apartment, will almost certainly draw the ire of his human
neighbors. Chapter 16 addresses ways to alleviate a clash
between a vocal Beagle and human sanity.
 They may have bathroom issues. The Beagle has a reputation
for being more difficult to housetrain than other breeds. Some
experts theorize that Beagle bathroom issues arise because the
dog’s nose is so sensitive that he can smell the tiniest vestige of
Part I: Getting to Know Beagles 
30
A place just for Beagles
Unlike many American breed clubs, the National Beagle Club (NBC) of America has
its very own farm: a 508-acre tract called The Institute Farm in Aldie, Virginia, which
is south of Washington, DC.
Five members of the club formed a corporation dubbed The Institute Corporation for
the express purpose of buying the land and administering the property for the NBC.
In 1916, the group bought the land — although the name of the seller remains an
open question. Records indicate that the corporation bought the land from the estate
of one Isabella Skinner Turner. However, one of the corporation’s founders said that
the land had been part of the estate of a gentleman who’d planned to use the tract
for a hunt club. The gentleman, whose name is not known, sailed to England to buy
a pack of hounds. To his great misfortune and that of the hounds, they sailed back to
America on the RMS Titanic and perished when that ship struck an iceberg and sank
in April 1912. Historians speculate that the gentleman had contracted to buy the prop-
erty but had not completed the purchase before he and his hounds met their deaths.
Today, The Institute Farm serves not only as the site for NBC-sponsored events to
test Beagles’ hunting prowess (called field trials by show folk) and specialty shows,
but it also has hosted seminars and events for other dog-related organizations.
Among the non-Beagle events held at the farm in recent years has been a seminar
for a “Bloodhound Training School” for law enforcement officers who work with
Bloodhounds in search-and-rescue.

left-behind accidents. Patience, consistency, and a commitment
to total cleanup of bathroom indiscretions are the keys to
teaching your Beagle proper potty protocol. Chapter 14 gives
you the scoop on how to housetrain your four-legged friend.
 They follow their noses. Humorist Dave Barry makes his
living by being funny — but when he described the Beagle as
a nose with four legs, he wasn’t kidding. A dog with a nose
sensitive enough to detect one piece of contraband fruit in a
pile of luggage is likely to be far more tuned in to the world
of smells than a human being would be. Such is the case
with the Beagle, who — like the hound that he is — lives to
follow the scent. This devotion to odor can get the Beagle
into trouble — such as going through the garbage can
indoors, wandering off the owner’s property outdoors and
not looking back, and attempting to eat anything and every-
thing, whether an item is meant to be eaten or not — if his
owner isn’t vigilant. Chapter 5 describes ways that owners
can make their homes impervious to Beagle explorations,
and Chapter 15 lists steps owners can take to keep their 
odor-driven companions from wandering away from hearth
and home.
 They won’t help your hay fever. No one can guarantee
that any breed of dog will never trigger allergic reactions
in people. However, some curly-coated dogs such as the
Standard Poodle or Portuguese Water Dogs are less likely
than most breeds to prompt the people in their lives to
sneeze, sniffle, or suffer from watery eyes. On the other hand,
the relatively short, straight hairs on the Beagle’s coat could
make an allergy-prone person’s life a living hell — particularly
during seasons when the dog sheds. And it’s not just the hair
that can trigger allergy attacks: The Beagle’s love of the out-
doors means he’s likely to carry other allergens, such as dirt,
grass, and leaves, into your home.
 They have their own agendas. Beagles are very intelligent
dogs, but they’re not necessarily as eager to please their
people as some other breeds such as Shetland Sheepdogs
or Golden Retrievers are. The apparent result may be a dog
who seems difficult to school in basic canine good manners,
much less teach advanced maneuvers to. Chapter 7 outlines
ways to build the bond between you and your Beagle from
your very first days together, and Chapters 15 and 16 outline
strategies for countering any stubbornness you encounter
when you try to train your four-legged friend.
Chapter 2: The Incredible, Lovable Beagle 31

These less-than-sterling qualities should give you pause if you’re
still debating whether to add a Beagle to your life. That said, none
of these apparent deficiencies has to mean that the Beagle makes
a bad pet. No dog is perfect — but a Beagle could well be your
dream dog despite any physical and behavioral challenges he
might pose. The keys to success are knowing what you’re getting
into and having the patience to raise and train your new friend to
be the best, not the worst, he can be.

f the Snoopy-dog’s big-eyed stare, happy-go-lucky personality,
low-maintenance coat, and awesome versatility have you
hooked, congratulations! Now you’re ready to start the next step
toward finding the dog of your dreams: figuring out where to look
for your new Beagle.
Fortunately, you can search for your new hound in several great
places — at least three, in fact. Unfortunately, though, Beagles may
abound at a couple of other types of places you should avoid. This
chapter gives you the scoop on where to look for your Beagle —
and where not to look as well.
Good Places to Look
You can find a Beagle from plenty of places, but some places are
decidedly better than others. The three sources I describe in this
section deserve unqualified endorsements.
A matter of breeding
If you’re looking for a puppy, your best chances for finding a
happy, healthy baby Beagle reside with a reputable breeder. That
said, not all breeders are created equal. Some breeders produce

Beagles strictly for monetary profit, sacrificing quality to enhance
their financial bottom lines. Others, however, breed these little
hounds because they want to improve the Beagle as a breed. These
breeders put puppies ahead of profits — and if you want a puppy,
you should put these types of breeders at the top of your list of
places to contact.
Why work with a breeder?
A good breeder offers many advantages to the person who wants
to raise a Beagle from puppyhood. First, your puppy won’t surprise
you when she reaches adulthood; in other words, you’ll have a
pretty good idea of what kind of adult your puppy will grow up to
be. That’s because a breeder can show you the pedigree of the
puppy you’re interested in, and also the pedigrees of the puppy’s
parents. You’ll also be able to meet the puppy’s mom — and if you
like the mom, you’ll probably like her pups, too.
A good breeder also makes sure that a puppy’s parents are certi-
fied as being free of health problems that are inherited in their
breed, such as the following:
 Joint problems: Many Beagle breeders have their dogs’ hips
and elbows rated by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals
(OFA) to ensure that the joints have developed properly. The
ratings are self-explanatory; for example, hips rated “excellent”
are just that. If the joints haven’t developed correctly, the
affected dog may eventually suffer from hip dysplasia or elbow
dysplasia, both of which are painful conditions that can lead to
irreversible arthritis. Other breeders opt for another procedure
called PennHIP — otherwise known as the University of
Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. This procedure uses
multiple X-rays to analyze a dog’s hips, and many vets consider
it to be more accurate than an OFA analysis.
 Eye diseases: Good breeders also screen their Beagles for eye
diseases and obtain certification by the Canine Eye Registry
Foundation (CERF).
These certifications are called clearances, and they’re all performed
by veterinary specialists such as orthopedists or ophthalmologists,
although vets can also perform the OFA or PennHIP procedures.
A reputable breeder also will try to learn a lot about you. She’s
likely to ask you lots of questions about your lifestyle, previous
dogs you’ve owned, and other members of your family. Her ques-
tions have two purposes: to ensure that your home is suitable for a
Beagle, and to learn enough about you to help you choose exactly
the right Beagle puppy. (See also the “What the breeder will ask
you” section in this chapter.)
Part I: Getting to Know Beagles 
34

And after you get your Beagle puppy, the reputable breeder won’t
disappear. Instead, she’s ready and willing to serve as an expert
resource who will help you solve any problems you encounter
after bringing your baby Beagle home — even years later.
That said, working with a reputable breeder has some disadvan-
tages. For one thing, a high-quality Beagle puppy doesn’t come
cheap. Expect to part with several hundred dollars if you opt to buy
a puppy from a good breeder and plan on having that puppy be
strictly a pet. If you want a show-quality Beagle, you’ll probably pay
even more. Chapter 4 tells you more about choosing a show-quality
Beagle, a pet-quality Beagle, or a Beagle who’s been bred to hunt.
Another possible problem in working with a good breeder is that
you may have to wait a long time to buy a puppy. That’s because
reputable Beagle breeders generally have only a few dogs and may
raise only two or three litters each year. Consequently, the demand
for healthy Beagle puppies generally far outstrips the supply of
such dogs, and buyers may have to wait many months before a
puppy is available.
No option is perfect. But if you’ve set your heart on raising your
Beagle from puppyhood, the reputable breeder is the way to go.
Finding a good breeder
How do you find these paragons of Beagle breeding? One place to
start is the American Kennel Club (AKC), which you can find on
the Web by logging onto www.akc.org/breederinfo/breeder_
search.cfm. There you’ll find a list of breeder referral contacts:
volunteers from different breed clubs who help prospective buyers
find nearby breeders. (Simply locate the “Breed Contacts” heading,
click “Breeder Referral,” and scroll down the alphabetical listing
of volunteers until you find the Beagle entry.) E-mail the breeder
referral contact for the National Beagle Club (NBC) of America, and
she’ll respond promptly with some names of local Beagle breeders
for you to contact.
In fact, the NBC has a list of breeders on its own Web site; just
mosey on over to http://clubs.akc.org/NBC/breeders_list.
There you’ll find a state-by-state list of NBC members who have
puppies for sale, at least occasionally.
Another way to find reputable breeders is to attend a dog show. To
find a dog show near you that will include Beagles, log onto the
AKC’s Web site at www.akc.org/events/search. Here you can
ferret out shows that feature Beagles as much as a year in advance
in up to three states per search. After you find a show, drive to the
event, buy a catalog (a program that lists when and in which rings
the various breeds will be shown), and take a look around the
Chapter 3: Gonna Find Me a Beagle 35

show site. Soon you’ll find the Beagle breeders, most of whom will
be happy to give you a business card and talk with you briefly
about their dogs in particular, and Beagles in general.
Don’t try to chat up a breeder when she’s about to take her dog
into the ring. At that point, she’s understandably nervous and is far
more interested in getting her dog ready than in talking to prospec-
tive buyers. Wait till she’s done and then introduce yourself.
Asking the right questions
Still not sure whether the breeder you’ve contacted is truly commit-
ted to raising healthy Beagle puppies? Just ask some questions —
either on the phone when you initially contact the breeder, or at
the breeder’s home after you’ve made an appointment to visit. The
answers to the following questions can either set your mind at rest
or prompt you to look elsewhere.
 Do the dogs you breed have health clearances? The right
answer here is, “Yes — I have my dogs’ hips, elbows, and eyes
checked. Would you like to see the certificates (or clearances)?”
If a breeder tells you, “My dogs don’t have any health prob-
lems,” don’t walk away — run!
 What are your breeding practices? Learning about a breeder’s
methods show whether she cares more about puppies than
profits. Ask questions such as how old the parents are and how
often the dam (or mama Beagle) gives birth. Using the same
dam more than once a year is a no-no, as is breeding dogs that
are under 2 years of age. Ask, too, whether the breeder owns
both the dam and the sire (or papa Beagle). The best answer
here is, “No,” which means that the breeder is willing to pay for
a healthy sire who’s likely to exemplify the best in Beagle health
and temperament.
 Where do you raise your puppies? The best answer to this
question is “In my house.” Home-raised puppies get exposure
to normal household noises and activity, which helps them
adjust better to their new homes than puppies raised in ken-
nels outside the breeder’s domicile. In addition, most puppies
should remain with their littermates and dam until they are
least 8 weeks old.
 What guarantees do you offer? A reputable breeder will stand
behind the health of any puppy she sells for the animal’s entire
life, and she will take back a problem pup at any time (though
not necessarily for a refund). Most breeders will guarantee in
writing that the puppy won’t develop hereditary problems for
a year or two. They’ll also allow you to have a few days to
have your new puppy checked by your own veterinarian. This
guarantee is very important in case the vet finds that the
Part I: Getting to Know Beagles 
36

puppy has a major health problem — the breeder should be
willing to either refund your money or replace the puppy.
Chapter 4 explores purchase and adoption contracts in detail.
 Do you belong to the National Beagle Club of America?
Membership in the NBC shows that the breeder is committed
to producing better Beagles in each generation. And check to
see whether any of the breeder’s dogs have earned their breed
championships (also known as conformation titles); a breeder
with plenty of champions to brag about is a person who not
only wants to breed great Beagles but has succeeded in doing
so. An answer in the negative is a reason for caution; the
breeder may have the best of intentions, but without the club
membership or titles, you can’t be sure that she’s committed
to breeding better Beagles, let alone any good at doing so.
 Do you have references? A good breeder will point you to sat-
isfied puppy buyers to help you confirm that she is, indeed, rep-
utable. If she refers you to her veterinarian, that’s even better.
 What do you want to know about me? A breeder who doesn’t
respond to this question with lots of questions of her own
may be a breeder to avoid. Her lack of interest in you may
reflect a lack of interest in where her puppy ends up.
What the breeder will ask you
After you’ve put a few questions to the breeder, she’s likely to want
to query you in return. Don’t be offended by her questions or feel
that she’s trying to be nosy. Her first concern is for the welfare of her
puppies. To that end, she’s likely to ask you the following questions:
 Why do you want a dog? A breeder asks this question to be
sure that you’re ready to commit yourself fully to raising her
puppy for that puppy’s entire life, and that you’ve done some
research before you’ve set off in search of a new canine com-
panion. Good answers to this question include wanting to give
and receive unconditional love; wanting someone to nurture;
and wanting company. A breeder’s likely to raise her eyebrows
if you respond that you want to teach your kids to be responsi-
ble (they shouldn’t be practicing on a Beagle) and looking for
protection (if you’ve done your homework, you should know
that Beagles aren’t meant to be watchdogs or protection dogs).
 Why do you want a Beagle? A breeder asks this to see whether
you know something about the breed. Chapter 2 can give you a
head start on developing the right answers in advance.
 Who will be primarily responsible for the puppy or dog? A
breeder asks this question because she wants to be sure that a
responsible adult will be the main caregiver for the puppy or
dog. The right answer here is “me,” “my spouse,” “my partner,”
Chapter 3: Gonna Find Me a Beagle 37

“Mom,” or “Dad.” The wrong answer is “my kids.” No child, no
matter what her age, should be the primary canine caregiver.
 Have you ever owned a dog? No wrong answer here.
Knowing whether you’re an experienced dog owner gives a
breeder important information that helps her determine
which of her puppies is best for you.
 How will you exercise this dog? Good answers include walk-
ing your Beagle three or four times a day on a leash and/or let-
ting the dog run in your securely fenced yard.
 Do you have children — and if so, how old are they? Having
kids doesn’t necessarily mean that you can’t have a Beagle
puppy. However, some breeders may hesitate to sell a puppy
to families with children under school age.
 Does anyone in your household have allergies? As Chapter 2
explains, Beagles do nothing to improve a person’s allergies. If
your family includes allergy sufferers, a breeder might ask
whether you’re willing to make adjustments such as cleaning
and vacuuming your house frequently and keeping the puppy
out of the allergic person’s bedroom.
 Does your living situation permit a dog? Only one right
answer here: yes. And be prepared to back up your answer in
the form of a lease clearly stating that pets are permitted, or
documents showing that you own your home.
 How do you feel about taking your dog for training and obe-
dience classes? Once again, only one right answer: fine.
Although you can start your Beagle’s training by employing
the info in Chapter 15, the two of you are more likely to live
together happily ever after if you also avail yourself of profes-
sional guidance.
 Will someone be home during the day to care for the dog?
The ideal answer is “yes,” but the minimally acceptable answer
is that someone can come home several times a day to care for
the puppy. If neither option is possible for you, show that you
can arrange for a petsitter to come and care for the puppy.
Chapter 13 discusses how to find a good petsitter or dog walker.
 Do you have a veterinarian, or do you know of one? Either
way, a yes shows that you can get professional care for the
puppy you’re considering. See Chapter 5 for additional advice
on choosing a vet.
Gimme shelter
If you’re OK with getting an older puppy or adult dog, you may well
find the Beagle of your dreams at your local animal shelter.
Part I: Getting to Know Beagles 
38

Maybe you thought that animal shelters carry only mixed-breed
dogs, and that you’re not likely to find a purebred dog like a Beagle.
Actually, though, a substantial number of animal shelter dogs are
purebreds; in fact, the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS)
estimates that a full one-third of the canine guests in most shelters
are purebred. And with the Beagle being among the five most popu-
lar dogs in the United States, the chances of finding a Snoopy-dog in
a shelter are reasonably good — especially if you’re patient.
You may have thought, too, that animal shelters are bleak, depress-
ing places that look as though they’ve come straight out of a
Charles Dickens novel. Think again. More and more cities, such as
Richmond, Virginia, and San Francisco, California, are turning their
shelters into state-of-the-art animal palaces. At these top-of-the-line
establishments, canine and feline guests stay in luxuriously
appointed animal apartments complete with soft beds and oodles
of toys to chew and play with.
Even those shelters offering more spartan accommodations are
doing more to attend to the emotional needs of their guests. I know
of one municipal shelter that’s located in a very grim section of a
major metropolitan city — but the shelter itself offers soft blankets
and towels for its doggy guests, a daily ration of rawhide chews,
daily runs in an adjoining field, volunteers to teach the dogs basic
good manners, and even a doggy agility course with A-frames, a
tunnel, and a tire ring to jump through.
Why adopt from a shelter?
Adopting a Beagle from an animal shelter carries two major advan-
tages over getting one from a reputable breeder:
 The shelter dog costs much less — generally, no more than
$100 to cover the cost of the dog’s care in the shelter.
 The adopter gets the enormous satisfaction of knowing that
she’s saved a dog’s life.
That’s not to say that a shelter Beagle doesn’t offer some chal-
lenges over the puppy purchased from a reputable breeder. Some
shelter dogs have behavioral problems — and those problems may
not show up right away. For example, you may realize that your
Beagle has no idea where he’s supposed to potty until after you’ve
had him with you for a couple of days.
And while they make every effort to give tender loving care to every
animal who needs it, shelter personnel often don’t know much about
many of those animals. Those who come to the shelter as strays,
of course, have no known histories at all — but even those surren-
dered by owners may come with very little information. In fact, such
Chapter 3: Gonna Find Me a Beagle 39

owners often give reasons for surrendering their dogs that have
little or nothing to do with the real factors behind their decisions.
That said, many dogs find themselves in shelters through no fault
of their own. More often than not, they’ve been the victims of irre-
sponsible owners who haven’t taken the time to train and care for
them properly. Others are victims of life changes such as the death
of an owner or some other change in a family’s circumstances.
Understanding the adoption process
In some ways, the process of adopting a dog from an animal shelter
doesn’t differ all that much from buying a puppy from a breeder.
Both sources want to be sure that you offer a suitable home for a
Beagle. Both will ask you a lot of questions to determine whether,
in fact, you make the grade.
Adopting a pet from a shelter usually isn’t a one-day event. Generally,
after you decide on a Beagle at an animal shelter, you’ll need to fill
out an application that’s likely to include an extensive questionnaire.
The questions will focus on your history with dogs, your family, your
work schedule, and your living situation. If you rent your home, be
prepared to give the shelter your landlord’s telephone number;
many shelters will call to make sure that your landlord allows you to
keep a pet. Be prepared, too, for a shelter volunteer to come visit
your home to make sure that it’s suitable for your Beagle. After your
application is approved, the shelter will arrange for your Beagle to
be spayed or neutered, if that operation hasn’t taken place already.
After the dog has a couple of days to recover from the surgery, you’ll
get the all-clear to take your new friend home.
You can find more information about shelter adoptions from
Successful Dog Adoption by Sue Sternberg (Howell Book House) and
from another For Dummies title, Adopting a Pet For Dummies by
Eve Adamson.
Finding a shelter in your area
You just may find your very own special Beagle at a nearby animal
shelter. Begin your search by checking your local print or online
telephone directory to uncover shelters located near you. Then,
log onto the shelter’s Web site (they all are on the Web now, it
seems!) and check their list of available dogs. If you see a Beagle,
pay the shelter a visit. But plan on being tough-minded; don’t fall
for the first pair of winsome Beagle eyes you see.
Rescue me!
If you like the idea of saving a dog’s life, are comfortable with
adopting an adult dog, but don’t want to wait too long to find a
Part I: Getting to Know Beagles 
40

Beagle, your best bet might be to adopt a dog through a breed
rescue group. Read on to find out why the rescue route may be the
way to go — and what to keep in mind if you choose this option.
Defining breed rescue
Beagle breed rescue is a multifaceted enterprise that aims to place
homeless Beagles into permanent adoptive homes.
The first part is the actual rescue. Beagle rescuers — all of whom
are volunteers — look for Beagles who need help; for example, a
dog who’s due to be euthanized at an overcrowded animal shelter.
In fact, a shelter often will ask Beagle rescuers or other purebred
rescue groups to take in a purebred dog so the shelter can make
room for new arrivals.
Other ways that Beagles enter rescue is via their original owners. A
change in life circumstances, the death of an owner, or an owner’s
inability to properly care for a dog are all reasons that a person
may surrender a dog to rescue. And all too often, Beagle rescuers
take in dogs that have been cruelly treated or otherwise neglected.
After the Beagle enters rescue, the group assigns the dog to a tem-
porary home — or what rescuers call a foster home. The foster-care
provider takes charge of the Beagle’s everyday care. She takes him
to a veterinarian for an initial examination to uncover any health
problems the dog may have and gives the dog any medical care he
needs. She also observes the dog carefully to determine whether
he has any training deficiencies or behavioral problems and then
takes steps to deal with those issues. The Beagle who pees in the
house begins housetraining; the shy Snoopy-dog receives gentle
encouragement to engage with the world.
As the Beagle’s rehabilitation progresses, the foster-care provider —
with the help of other volunteers — begins to look for a permanent
home for the dog. The group’s aim is to find a happy ending for each
rescued Beagle: placement in a loving forever home.
Considering rescue pro’s and con’s
Working with a rescue group to find the Beagle of your dreams car-
ries many advantages. For one thing, by adopting a rescued Beagle
you know that you’re giving him a second chance to live in a
happy, permanent home. Many people reap tremendous satisfac-
tion from knowing that they’ve changed the lives of down-on-their
luck dogs. That satisfaction increases when the rescued dogs heap
love and devotion onto their new human companions. Many
adopters of rescued Beagles and other dogs believe that their new
canine buddies somehow know that they’ve gotten second
chances and that they’re grateful.
Chapter 3: Gonna Find Me a Beagle 41

Another plus to getting your Beagle through a rescue group is that
the volunteer foster “parents” usually get to know their foster “kids”
very well. The foster-care provider can provide you with a detailed
description of how a fostered dog behaves in a household and will
give you a heads-up on possible challenges a particular dog may
pose. Such knowledge not only helps you determine whether a dog
is right for you and your lifestyle, but also enables the rescue group
to place each of its Beagles in the best possible homes. For example,
the group may discover that Beagle A isn’t crazy about children
(which would be very unusual, but it can happen) and would take
care to place that dog in a child-free home.
Still another reason to consider adopting a rescued Beagle is the
relatively low price tag. For example, Beagle Rescue, Education,
and Welfare (BREW) charges an adoption fee of just $200. That’s
really a pittance considering what that fee covers: spaying or neu-
tering, any immunizations needed, deworming (if necessary),
heartworm testing, microchip implanting, and any other medical
treatment the Beagle may need. However, other rescue groups may
charge a different amount or provide fewer services — so make
sure that you know exactly what your fee is paying for.
However, a rescued Beagle is not necessarily a problem-free Beagle.
Many Beagles find themselves in rescue because of behavioral prob-
lems. Before you adopt any Beagle (or any dog, for that matter) from
a rescue group, make sure you find out whether that dog has any
emotional baggage. Ask whether the dog has any fears, phobias, or
other behavioral challenges. Then, after you find out what the
Beagle’s issues are, figure out how you’ll deal with those issues —
and make a rock-solid commitment to do so. You may need simply
to spend more time with your new dog than you anticipated. (But
then, Beagles are so cute you’d probably do that anyway!) On the
other hand, the Beagle’s issues may be so complicated that you
need to work one on one with a trainer or animal behaviorist to
solve the dog’s special problems. Chapter 15 can help you deal with
many of those challenges, either on your own or with the help of a
professional.
Understanding the rescue adoption process
Rescue groups have one overriding goal: to place the Beagles in their
care into forever homes. Unlike many animal shelters, which may
need to euthanize dogs who aren’t adopted within a certain time
period, good rescue groups will hold onto adoptable dogs for as long
as necessary until those dogs find permanent homes. Such a policy
means you or any other wannabe adopter won’t get to take home a
Beagle until the rescue group decides that you are Beagle-ready.
To that end, many rescue groups post on their Web sites a list of
requirements that prospective adopters must meet before they
Part I: Getting to Know Beagles 
42

can even fill out an application. For example, BREW requires that
an adopter agree to give his Beagle at least 30 days to adjust to life
in a new household. Other groups may require adopters to have
fenced yards to thwart the Beagle’s all-too-well-known penchant
for wandering.
If you meet those requirements, you can fill out an adoption appli-
cation. Be prepared to answer a lot of questions about your living
situation, the members of your family, your work situation, your
landlord’s telephone number (if you rent your home), and your
knowledge of dogs in general and Beagles in particular. Don’t be
offended; the rescue group’s not trying to play Big Brother. The
group just wants to be sure that any Beagle you take into your
home will stay in your home; in other words, that you can give a
rescued Beagle the second chance he deserves.
After you send in your application, a rescue volunteer will check out
your references and visit your home to make sure it’s as good as you
say it is. Assuming it is, you’ll get the rescue group’s approval. With
that thumbs-up, feel free to log onto the rescue group’s Web site to
see if you can find a Beagle you want — and hop on over to Chapter
4 for pointers on picking the right Beagle for you.

No rescue Beagles nearby? Not to worry. Some rescue groups can
help you find a dog who lives outside your local area and arrange to
have the animal transported to you. If you’re interested in this pos-
sibility, ask the rescue coordinator about whether the group oper-
ates a “Canine Underground Railroad,” or whether she can help you
find out more about rescue dogs who live beyond your local area.
Just Say No: Poor Places to Look
In the where-not-to-look category are three sources that may help
you find a Beagle now, but lead to heartbreak later. If you want to
maximize your chances of getting a healthy, happy dog, avoid the
quick-and-easy route the following three sources appear to offer.
Classified newspaper ads
If you scan the classified advertising of your local newspaper —
particularly if that paper is a big metropolitan daily — you’re likely
to see a couple of pages that list puppies and dogs for sale, at least
a few of which probably will be Beagles. After each listing is a
phone number to call. For you, a busy Beagle searcher, the classi-
fieds may seem like a shortcut to finding your dream dog.
Unfortunately, that’s not usually the case.
Reputable breeders generally don’t need to advertise their litters
anywhere. The high quality and good health of their puppies gives
these breeders all the advertising they need. Such breeders have
far more potential customers than they have puppies to sell. They
keep waiting lists of people who want to acquire Beagle pups.
When such breeders do have a litter available (which may be true
only a couple of times a year), they contact those on their waiting
lists to give them a chance to buy a puppy.
So, who does need to advertise? Generally, a breeder who adver-
tises in the classifieds hasn’t taken the time or doesn’t know how
to produce the healthiest Beagles possible. She probably hasn’t
done the research necessary to find the best sire (father dog) to
breed to her dam (mama dog). She almost certainly hasn’t taken
the time or spent the money necessary to ensure that the sire and
dam don’t have any serious health problems they could pass on to
the puppies. And she may know little or nothing about the best
environment in which to raise a litter after that litter is born. In
short, the classified ads are probably one of the worst places to
look for the Beagle of your dreams.
Part I: Getting to Know Beagles 
44

Although newspaper classifieds generally should be among the last
places you go to look for a Beagle puppy from a breeder, some-
times breed rescue groups seek permanent domiciles for homeless
adult Beagles by placing ads. If you see a Beagle rescue group’s ad
for one or more adult dogs, give it a look — and check out the sec-
tions on rescue that appear elsewhere in this chapter for pointers
on how to adopt a dog from a rescue group.
Backyard breeders
What wonderful timing! Just as you’ve decided that yes, the Beagle
is the right breed for you, your neighbor down the street tells you
that she’s breeding her Beagles, Sammy and Sally. What’s more,
she’ll let you have first pick of the little Sammies and Sallies she
expects to result from this most fortuitous union. Do you take her
up on her offer?
In a word, no.
Unless your neighbor is an experienced breeder who has entered
her Beagles in dog shows and won multiple titles, she brings even
less to the breeding process than the breeder who advertises in
the newspaper. She may be a great neighbor whose ethics are
above reproach. But ethics and neighborliness aren’t nearly
enough to maximize the odds that the Beagle puppies she pro-
duces will be physically and emotionally healthy. Instead of loving
your neighbor (at least in this particular instance), read this chap-
ter to discover how to find the experienced breeder you need.
Pet stores
For the most part, pet stores — especially the kind that used to be
ubiquitous in shopping malls and shopping centers — are the last
places you should look for a Beagle puppy or adult. The reason:
Many of the Beagles and other dogs in these stores come from
puppy mills, which are notorious for breeding dogs under horren-
dous conditions.
Unlike legitimate breeders, compassionate rescue groups, and all-
breed animal shelters, proprietors of many pet stores and just
about all puppy mills have one overriding motive: monetary profit.
Consequently, mill operators generally don’t give their dogs the
care they need to be happy and healthy. The puppies that come
from these mills almost always are in extremely poor physical 
condition — riddled with parasites, beset with kennel cough, and
often malnourished. They also tend to have way more behavioral
problems, especially when it comes to housetraining, than dogs
Chapter 3: Gonna Find Me a Beagle 45

who come from other, more reputable sources. And to add insult to
injury, these stores often charge more for their puppies than rep-
utable breeders charge for theirs.
But here is an important caveat: A pet store can be a great place to
look for an adult dog — if the dog is there as part of a rescue group
event. Many organizations that care for rescued dogs like to bring
those dogs to enlightened pet stores as part of a meet-and-greet
event for the public. A prospective adopter gets to meet a dog in
the flesh, apply to adopt the dog, and buy whatever dog care sup-
plies he needs, all in one place at one time. Log on to the Web site
of the rescue group you’re interested in, where you’ll almost cer-
tainly find a list of such adoption events.
Proceed with Caution: Adopting
from the Internet
Log onto the Web, and on just one puppy-selling Web site alone,
you can find well over 600 baby Beagles to choose from. There you
are, sitting in your comfortable home, poring over photographs of
adorable-looking puppies. Kinda like Internet dating, you think.
What’s not to like?
Well, actually, you should take some time to pause and reflect. The
folks who advertise their Beagle puppies on the Web probably
don’t know any more about proper breeding practices than those
who advertise in the classifieds. Worse, you probably won’t be able
to see most of these puppies in person.
But that doesn’t mean that you should avoid all Web sites advertis-
ing Beagles. For example, on the American Kennel Club’s Web site
you can search a database consisting of thousands of breeders from
all over the United States. After you read the educational materials
the AKC has conveniently added to the site, log onto www.akc.org/
classified/search, type in your search terms as directed, and
begin your search. The Beagle breeders who pop up will be individu-
als who are members in good standing of the National Beagle Club of
America, and they’ll all be within a half-day’s drive from your home.
The Internet can also be a good place to look for an adult Beagle.
Many breed rescue groups, including for Beagles, cooperate with
the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
(ASPCA) to list adoptable dogs on Petfinder (www.petfinder.org).
The listings also provide contact information for the rescue groups
that are posting, so if you see a Beagle you like, you can get in
touch with the group directly. This humongous Web site should be
the first stop for anyone who’s looking to adopt a homeless animal.

Choosing Your Beagle
Soul Mate
In This Chapter
 Exploring options when choosing a Beagle
 Knowing what to look for in a Beagle puppy
 Evaluating an adult Beagle
 Learning about contracts and other important documents
You’re ready. You’ve determined that yes, the Beagle is the
breed for you. You’ve figured out where the best place to find
your dream Beagle is: reputable breeder, animal shelter, or breed
rescue group. Now comes the trickiest part: choosing your Beagle.
Picking the Beagle who will be your canine companion is much
more than falling for the first endearing face you see. This chapter
explains what you need to know to select the Snoopy-dog who’s
right for you, your family, and your way of living.
Narrowing Your Choices
The beauty of Beagles is that you have so many options to con-
sider. Do you want a boy Beagle or a girl Beagle? Do you want a dog
who wins ribbons in dog shows, a dog who can hunt, or a dog
who’s simply your wonderful best friend? Does raising a cute little
puppy appeal to you, or would you rather skip the puppy stuff and
welcome home an adult dog? And if having one Beagle is great, is
having two Beagles even better? This section doesn’t answer any
of those questions for you, but it gives you the info you need to
answer them for yourself.
Male or female?
Most experts agree that little difference in temperament exists
between male and female Beagles. Both are friendly to people and

other dogs. Both would follow their noses to the ends of the earth if
they were given the chance. Both are capable of being bossy or of
being meek. Both are known to engage in that inimitable Beagle-song
otherwise known as howling. And both should be altered in some
fashion — spaying for females, neutering for males — unless you
plan to breed them. (Chapter 11 provides more info on breeding.)
So if male and female Beagles have similar temperaments, should
you favor one gender over the other for any reason? The answer to
that question depends on your individual situation and personal
preferences. Here are some gender differences to consider:
 If you already have a dog and want to add a Beagle to your
household pack, your best bet is to choose a Beagle of the
opposite gender. In other words, if your first dog is male, your
Beagle should be a female — and vice versa. Opposite-sex
dogs tend to get along better with each other than same-sex
dogs do, even if the same-sex dogs are neutered or spayed —
although there are plenty of exceptions to that principle.
 The male Beagle is probably less likely to keep his private
parts private than his sister is. Males will lick their genitals
and will hump inappropriate objects, such as the table leg or
your leg, with little or no fanfare. Females are much less likely
to engage in such behavior — although girl dogs have been
known to hump other dogs and even humans to show that
they (the humpers) are in charge.
 Males and females deal with bathroom issues differently. The
adolescent and adult male Beagle lifts his leg and pees on
nearby vertical surfaces, and at times, targets a specific sur-
face and subjects that surface to repeated anointings. This
behavior, which experts call marking, can ruin the surface that
bears the brunt of the dog’s attention. By contrast, females
squat daintily to pee and rarely engage in marking.
Neutering your male Beagle before he reaches adulthood is
likely to put an end to marking, or at least diminish it consid-
erably. Neutering may also enable your Beagle guy to be more
discreet in dealing with his remaining private parts than is the
case with the typical intact male.
 Adult female Beagles are ready for love approximately twice a
year unless they are spayed. These events, or heat cycles,
signal that your dog is ready for mating. The scent of her dis-
charge will lure male dogs from all over creation — or at least
from all over your neighborhood — to your doorstep, ready to
service your Beagle girl. To prevent an unplanned pregnancy,
you need to confine your Beagle when her heat cycle occurs.
Better yet, if you don’t plan to breed your Beagle, have her
spayed before she reaches adulthood.

Spaying your female Beagle not only prevents unwanted lit-
ters of puppies but also virtually eliminates the chance that
your dog will get mammary (breast) cancer if done before her
first heat cycle.
Field dog, show dog, or pet?
Just because they’re the same breed doesn’t mean that all Beagles
are the same — not by a long shot. The task a Beagle was bred to
perform has a very significant impact on that dog’s temperament,
personality, and suitability for your lifestyle.
The field dog is a Beagle who’s been bred to hunt rabbits. As such,
she’s likely to be much more energetic and require much more
exercise than the dog who’s been bred for the show ring or for life
as a pampered pet. She also probably will be much more vocal — a
trait that will not endear you to your neighbors. A Beagle bred for
hunting won’t be happy in your average pet-loving household, and
you probably won’t be happy with her, either.
The show dog is a Beagle who comes exceptionally close to meeting
the breed standard, which is the National Beagle Club of America’s
blueprint for a perfect Beagle. (See Chapter 2 for more info on the
breed standard and the ideal Beagle.) For that reason, she’s likely to
be far more expensive than a Beagle who doesn’t epitomize the
standard quite as well. Moreover, the breeder may want to retain
some ownership of the dog as well in order to show her, or he may
require you to sign a contract specifying that you will show her. If
the breeder opts to show the dog, she’ll probably spend quite a few
weekends away from you to compete in shows. If you opt to show
the dog, the two of you will be spending more than a few weekends
going to dog shows. And even though the show dog can make a
lovely pet, just because she’s a gorgeous example of a Beagle has
absolutely no effect on what sort of pet she’ll be.
The pet is a wonderful Beagle who, for one reason or another, just
isn’t suited to the show ring. The reason may be as simple as a
breeder expecting a puppy to grow over 15 inches in height —
which disqualifies a Beagle from being shown. Other problems or
faults such as ears set too high on the head or eyes deemed too
small could end a Beagle’s show career before it even starts, but
these traits would have absolutely no effect on whether that dog
would make a marvelous pet for you.
Puppy or adult?
Deciding whether to get a juvenile Snoopy-dog or an adult Beagle
isn’t necessarily a clear-cut matter. The right decision depends on
Chapter 4: Choosing Your Beagle Soul Mate 49

your personal preferences and also on how much time you can
spend taking care of your dog.
Without question, Beagle puppies are extremely cute and cuddly.
And a lot can be said for raising a dog from near-infancy. For one
thing, you can control what kind of adult a puppy becomes. You can
teach that puppy what you want her to know, and you can make sure
that she doesn’t develop any bad habits. You can start her training at
the best possible time — in puppyhood — and you can make sure
that her earliest experiences in life are all positive and happy.
However, raising a puppy is a lot of work. You’ll have to contend
with the whole business of housetraining, for one thing. Despite
what I tell you in Chapter 14 to help make the whole process as pain-
less as possible, you nevertheless will have to get up during the
night to give your Beagle baby a bathroom break — at least for the
first couple of weeks after you bring your dog home. And for at least
a few months, you or someone else need to be around during the
day to give your puppy potty time at least every couple of hours —
and possibly even more often. Puppies also need regular meals and
constant vigilance to prevent bathroom accidents and to keep them
from destroying your house and otherwise getting into mischief.
Adult Beagles, on the other hand, don’t need such close
monitoring — at least not when it comes to bathroom matters.
They also generally have a pretty good idea as to how they should
behave in a human household, so they’re less likely to make your
house look like a rock star’s hotel room than the juvenile Beagle is.
However, depending on where your adult Beagle lived before she
met you, she may come with some emotional baggage or at least
some bad habits that require time and patient remedial training
to redo — or undo.
For many people, the puppy-or-adult decision depends on whether
someone can be home during the day to care for a youngster. If
you’re away from home for more than a couple of hours each day,
and no one else is around to give a puppy the constant attention
she needs, do that puppy a favor: Get an adult dog instead.
Double your pleasure, double
your fun? Maybe not
More than few prospective owners consider getting two Beagles
at a time. They may think that the two dogs can keep each other
company and out of mischief. Or, they may feel unable to choose
between two adorable Beagle puppies and decide to get both. But
even though two Beagles, such as those in the color section, may
Part I: Getting to Know Beagles 
50

mean double the cuteness, they won’t necessarily double your
pleasure. Here’s why:
 If one puppy is a lot of work, two puppies are a lot more work.
Trying to keep track of one frisky puppy is tiring enough; mon-
itoring two Beagle mischief-makers may be a short trip to
utter exhaustion, if not a complete nervous breakdown.
 A solitary puppy will bond with her human, but two puppies
who enter a household at the same time are more likely to
bond with each other than with any human beings in their
household. You, the owner, end up getting double the puppy
care with much less of a payoff in the form of a cute, cuddly
little puppy worshipping the ground you walk on. The two
puppies you work your tail off raising are more likely to be
interested in each other than in you.
 Adopting two adult Beagles also means double the work of
adopting one — and that’s assuming the two dogs get along.
In short, bringing two Beagles into your household at the same
time probably isn’t a good idea, unless you’re a very experienced
dog owner. If you absolutely must have two Snoopy-dogs, wait a
few months before you acquire dog number two. Then you’ll have
time to get to know your first dog and give her the one-on-one
attention that gets any new dog — puppy or adult — off to the best
possible start.
Selecting a Puppy
Finding the puppy of your dreams is a two-part process. The first
task is to find a reputable breeder, which I describe in Chapter 3.
After you’ve found a breeder who has puppies available, the
second task begins: picking your puppy.
Selecting one puppy isn’t easy when you’ve got a bunch of wiggly
little darlings crawling all over the place and breathing their sweet,
milky puppy breath on you. How do you decide which puppy is
right for you? Heck, how do you know if any of these puppies
are right for you?
Start by answering the second question first. A good way to deter-
mine whether this litter is one for you to look at is to meet Mama
Beagle. A dam who’s clean, healthy-looking, and friendly is likely to
produce puppies who are as healthy and friendly as she is.
Then watch the puppies as they play together. Pay close attention
to their movements; make sure that they walk and run without dif-
ficulty. A puppy who limps or appears to lack energy may have
health problems you probably don’t want to take on.
Chapter 4: Choosing Your Beagle Soul Mate 51

As the puppies play, give yourself time to distinguish one from the
other. Eventually, you’ll either find that one particular puppy
appeals to you or that you appeal to one particular puppy (as in,
she’ll come over to say hello).
The puppy who’s confident enough to approach you and who
behaves in a friendly fashion when she’s there will probably keep
that good temperament into adulthood. In other words, the puppy
who chooses you may be your best bet.
Either way, as you cuddle the little darling, check for the following:
 Bright, clear eyes: The puppy should have clear, bright eyes
like the youngsters featured in the color section of this book.
Discharge from the eye or cloudiness in the eye itself may
signal the presence of an infection or other eye problem. The
pup also should be able to follow a moving object with her
eyes. (If she can’t, she may be blind.)
 Dry, odor-free ears: The smell of baking bread is lovely when
it comes from a kitchen, but not when it comes from a
Beagle’s ears. A yeasty odor in the ear area probably means
the pup has a yeast infection; other odors also indicate infec-
tion is present. Check the pup’s hearing, too; just clap your
hands to see whether the pup responds to the sound. If she
doesn’t, she may have a hearing problem.
 Clean skin and full coat: The pup should have no dirt or
scabs on her skin or bald spots on her coat. Also check for
fleas; if you see little dark specks hop around the coat, the
pup is carrying these unwanted critters and probably hasn’t
gotten the care she should have.
Part I: Getting to Know Beagles 
52
Should you meet Dad?
Maybe. But then again, maybe not.
Meeting the mother of any Beagle litter you’re looking at is a good idea, but the
same is not necessarily true of meeting the father, or sire. If Daddy Beagle’s on the
breeder’s premises because the breeder owns him, chances are that sire and dam
may be related rather closely to each other. Breedings of closely related dogs, even
if they appear healthy, may result in puppies who have congenital conditions or
other less-than-desirable qualities.
On the other hand, if the sire belongs to another breeder and is just staying with
your breeder temporarily, go ahead and give him a look. Getting acquainted with
Papa Beagle can give you that much more information on what sorts of dogs his
puppies will grow up to be.

 Healthy stools: I know it sounds gross, but take a peek into
the puppies’ living area to see what their poop looks like. The
stools should be firm and formed, not runny.
 Sound temperament: Use the time that you spend with the
puppy to try to get a feel for her personality — and whether
that personality meshes with yours. Is she a little firecracker, or
is she content to cuddle quietly? Does she roll over onto to her
back for a tummy scratch, or does she fight efforts to put her in
that position? The quiet cuddler who submits to belly rubs is
likely to be easier to live with and train than the fractious fire-
cracker. On the other hand, the firecracker pup may be better
suited for life in a busy, active family than that low-key little
cuddler.
Be wary of the shy little darling who won’t come to you at all.
Beagles shouldn’t be timid — and a dog of any breed who’s that
reticent may turn out to be a dog who bites out of fear.
Selecting an Adult Beagle
Choosing an adult Beagle is similar to selecting a puppy — to a
point. You want to look for the same traits in a full-grown Beagle as
in a pup: healthy eyes, ears, and skin; sound temperament; good
movement; and a full coat. But unlike with a puppy from a rep-
utable breeder, you don’t necessarily want to reject an adult Beagle
who doesn’t look or act quite as healthy as the well-bred puppy.
Most adult Beagles come from animal shelters and rescue groups —
and many of these dogs find themselves in these settings because
their original owners couldn’t or wouldn’t take proper care of them.
Consequently, these dogs may have a couple of physical problems
or behavioral issues. But with the help of shelter or rescue person-
nel, your veterinarian, and/or a professional dog trainer, you and
your adult Beagle can overcome these challenges and live happily
ever after.
Chapter 4: Choosing Your Beagle Soul Mate 53
Breeder’s choice
If your breeder wants to select a puppy for you instead of allowing you to choose a
pup, don’t fret. Many breeders prefer to control the puppy selection process. Such
breeders believe that they know their puppies better than anyone else and that they’re
in the best position to match puppies with people. If your breeder is part of this camp,
share your preferences with her — for example, whether you want a male or female
Beagle pup — but then trust her to make a good choice for you and your family.

Don’t reject the adult Beagle because of the following:
 Her ears smell yeasty. Your vet can prescribe antibiotics to
knock out the infection causing the yeasty odor, and he can
show you how to clean the ears to keep the infection from
coming back.
 Her coat and skin aren’t perfect. A trip to the vet to deal with
minor skin rashes, combined with an optimum diet (as
described in Chapters 6 and 8), can turn a not-so-great-looking
Beagle exterior into a picture of perfect hound health.
 She’s coughing. Dogs confined with a lot of other dogs are
more vulnerable to bordetella, also known as kennel cough.
This condition is treatable — and after you treat the disease,
you can keep it from coming back by having your vet give the
dog a shot designed for just that purpose.
 Her temperament’s not perfect. Experiences of abandon-
ment, neglect, and even abuse can cause an otherwise healthy
dog to be anxious, hyperactive, or a little shy, but don’t rule
out such a dog automatically. The stress of being in a noisy
shelter can affect a dog’s temperament, too. Time spent in a
Part I: Getting to Know Beagles 
54
A family affair
Here’s how to max the odds that everyone will live happily ever after with your
Beagle — and vice versa:
 Ban surprises. Giving a Beagle puppy or adult dog as a holiday, birthday, or
Valentine’s Day surprise gift is not a good idea. The commotion of the holiday
practically guarantees that the new dog won’t get off to a good start, and the
recipient may be unprepared to care for a dog. 
 Make a promise. Instead of giving a Beagle as a gift, create a gift certificate or
I.O.U. promising to choose a dog together after a birthday or holiday passes.
Meanwhile, present the recipient with a collar and leash — and to give him a
really good head start on raising a Beagle, give him this book!
 Bring your partner, spouse, and children with you to the breeder, shelter, or
rescue foster-care provider. Allow everyone to look at the puppies or dogs, to
handle them (children should be carefully supervised, however), and to weigh
in on which dogs they like — and don’t like.
 Include your other pets. Ask your breeder, shelter professional, or rescue group
member whether you can introduce your current pet to your possible future pet
before you make a final purchase or adoption decision.
 Make it unanimous. If one family member doesn’t like the puppy or dog the
others have chosen, don’t overrule that lone veto. Make sure that the Beagle
you take home is the puppy or dog that everyone in your family wants.

loving home coupled with consistent, patient training can go a
long way toward helping a shelter or rescue Beagle’s true per-
sonality to emerge.
If you’re having trouble evaluating a shelter dog’s temperament,
ask shelter personnel if you can take her to a quiet room or out
into a fenced courtyard. A little bit of one-on-one time away
from the noise of the shelter kennel may be just what a shelter
Beagle needs to show you what a sweetheart she really can be.
Of course, some problems you may encounter with an adult Beagle
should result in an automatic thumbs-down, no matter how much
you otherwise like the dog. Deal-breaking problems include these:
 A Beagle who growls at you for no apparent reason:
Aggressiveness in a dog is a problem you do not want to have
to deal with.
 A dog who cringes in the corner of her crate or kennel: The
very shy dog may turn out to be a fear-biter.
 A dog who bites: The adult Beagle who literally puts teeth in
her interaction with you should not get any additional interac-
tion opportunities — not with you or your family, anyway.
Pushing Papers
After much deliberation, you and other members of your family
have chosen a Beagle of your very own. (Or perhaps she chose you!)
Either way, now that you’ve made your choice, you need to seal the
deal. At the very least, the breeder, animal shelter, or rescue group
will give you a purchase or adoption contract to sign and probably
also some written instructions on how to care for your new family
member. Here’s the scoop on what you’ll get and why.
Buyer or adoption contract
Once you agree to buy or adopt a Beagle, you need to formalize the
transaction with a written contract. Such documents protect the
puppy or adult dog by clarifying the rights and responsibilities of
the buyer or adopter, and the breeder, shelter, or rescue group.
The document should address the following issues:
 Terms of sale: The contract should state whether the puppy
is a companion animal or a show dog. If the latter is the case,
the contract should state whether the breeder retains partial
ownership of the puppy (often the case with show dogs). If
the breeder is selling the puppy as a pet, the contract should
state when the dog needs to be spayed or neutered.
Chapter 4: Choosing Your Beagle Soul Mate 55

 Financials: The contract should state what the breeder is
charging for the dog and how that money is to be paid (by cash
or check? All at once or in installments?). This provision should
also specify the terms of any deposits, such as a deposit for
altering a dog or completing basic obedience training.
 Health guarantees: At minimum, a contract should let the
buyer return a dog for a refund if the animal gets sick shortly
after the sale or becomes ill because of a hereditary defect. A
better contract permits the exchange of a sick puppy for a
healthy one or lets the owner keep the sick dog but be reim-
bursed by the breeder for reasonable costs.
 Return provisions: The best breeders agree to take a puppy
back at any time after the sale, even if several years have
passed. They understand that sometimes life deals a hand
that just doesn’t allow a person to keep a pooch, even if that
pooch is a much-loved Beagle. Breeders also understand that
sometimes people bring their new puppies home and find that
puppy care is more than they can handle. For that reason, a
fair contract allows a person to return a puppy for any reason
within a few days after purchase and get a refund.
Shelter and rescue adoption contracts are quite similar to breed-
ers’ contracts, except that they don’t contain any provisions for
showing the dog. That’s because shelter and rescue dogs are all
spayed and neutered — if not by the shelter or rescue group, then
by the adopter as a condition of the adoption — which means they
aren’t eligible for dog shows. Adoption contracts may also contain
more provisions than breeders’ contracts as to how the adopter is
expected to care for the Beagle. Adoption contracts commonly:
 Require that the owner has a fenced yard: This condition
especially applies for Beagles, who are known to follow their
noses to the ends of the earth, unless confined properly.
 Forbid keeping the dog outdoors: Such provisions result
from the Beagle being a very social individual who spends
most of her time with her family and in her family’s house, not
banished to the backyard to live on her own.
 Prohibit tie-outs: Shelters and rescue groups understand that
tying a dog to a post or pole outdoors not only endangers the
animal but can result in aggressive behavior.
AKC papers
A reputable Beagle breeder should provide you with papers to regis-
ter your puppy with the American Kennel Club. You’re not required
Part I: Getting to Know Beagles 
56

to register your puppy — but you can’t compete with her in AKC
sports such agility or obedience unless you do.
If you’re buying a show-quality Beagle, you’ll apply for a full regis-
tration for your puppy. This registration certifies that your Beagle
is a purebred dog, lets her trip the ring fantastic, and permits her
offspring to be registered with the AKC. If your Beagle isn’t des-
tined for the show ring, you’ll apply for a limited registration. A dog
with this registration is also a certifiably purebred dog but can’t
enter dog shows. The offspring are ineligible for AKC registration.
However, a Beagle with a limited registration can enter AKC sports.
Either way, the breeder will fill out parts of the form (called the
blue slip) dealing with your pup’s breed, birth date, names of the
parents, the breeder’s name and address, and the AKC registration
number for your puppy’s litter. She’ll give the forms to you to com-
plete, sign, and send (along with a fee) to the AKC. The AKC then
transfers ownership of the puppy to you and sends you a certifi-
cate with your puppy’s new AKC number.
Make sure that you get your AKC papers before you leave your
breeder’s premises with your new puppy – or your Beagle can’t
enter any AKC events.
The breeder also should give you a copy of your puppy’s pedigree,
which is a chart that depicts your Beagle’s family tree. The pedi-
gree includes the names of your puppy’s sire and dam, their sires
and dams, and offspring from the previous three to five genera-
tions. If you plan to breed your Beagle, such info is essential; if
breeding’s not on your agenda, the info is still fun to have.
Health clearances
Your breeder should give you copies of any health clearances given
to your puppy’s sire and dam, such as approved hips and elbows
from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) (or a PennHIP
clearance, see Chapter 3) and the Canine Eye Registry Foundation
(CERF). Keep these clearances with your puppy’s health records.
And speaking of health records, your breeder should give you
information as to whether and when your puppy received any
immunizations and which diseases she’s been immunized against.
You also need to know about any treatment for worms or other
parasites your pup may have received. A shelter or rescue group
should provide similar info about an adult Beagle.
Chapter 4: Choosing Your Beagle Soul Mate 57

Care instructions
The breeder, shelter, or rescue group should provide you with
basic information on how to care for your new Beagle. The info
should include a description of when to feed your Beagle and what
the dog’s been eating up until now.
Try to feed your new Beagle the same food she’s been eating at
the breeder, shelter, or foster-care provider, at least for a couple
of weeks or so. Consistency in feeding helps keep her tummy from
getting upset during the exciting and sometimes stressful transi-
tion from her previous living environment to her new home. Some
breeders will even give you a small sample of the food they’ve
been feeding your puppy; ask your breeder if she can give you a
couple of meals worth of your puppy’s current chow. If you plan
to switch from the dog’s current diet to another food regimen,
Chapter 8 explains how to do so.
If your Beagle has recently been spayed or neutered, the shelter or
rescue group should provide instructions on how to care for the
incision and let you know about any other care she needs.
Homeward Bound? Maybe Not
Just because you’ve signed a contract and paid some money
doesn’t mean that you’ll be able to take your new Beagle home
right away. Here are some reasons why you may need to delay
your gratification:
 The puppy is too young. Good breeders don’t let puppies go
to permanent homes until they’re 8 weeks old. A puppy needs
those first weeks to wean herself, learn to eat solid food, and
learn how to interact politely with other dogs.
 The shelter needs to check your home. Many shelters hold off
on finalizing adoptions because they want to see the adopter’s
home first and make sure that it’s a good place for a Beagle to
live. Normally, such delays are only a matter of days. When
your home passes muster, your new dog can come home.
 The dog needs to be fixed. Cash-strapped animal shelters
(which most seem to be) often delay spaying or neutering
a Beagle until that dog has an adoption pending and the
would-be adopter has paid a fee for the procedure. After
the surgery is completed and the dog has had a few days to
recover, the adoption proceeds and the Beagle goes to her
new home.

Beagle’s Arrival

C
hoosing the Beagle of your dreams involves much more than
heading to a reputable breeder, a local animal shelter, or a
breed rescue group. Before you start life with your new four-legged
friend, you need to prepare yourself and your home for his arrival.
This chapter tells you how to accomplish both tasks.
Choosing a Veterinarian
No one can raise a Beagle alone. As hard as you’ll work to keep
your new family member healthy, he inevitably will get sick. To
cure him of his ills (not to mention prevent him from being struck
by some nasty disease), you need a veterinarian for your Beagle —
and you need one now.
You may be tempted to wait until your Beagle gets sick before you
find a vet for him. But your dog deserves better than such a hap-
hazard approach to his health care.
Choose your Beagle’s veterinarian with the same care that you
would use to select a pediatrician for your child. Start by asking
for recommendations from friends who have the same attitude
toward owning pets as you do. Other options include going online

or opening your printed telephone directory to choose a few
animal clinics to visit. Then, after you cross the threshold of the
clinic you’re considering, ask yourself some questions, such as:
 Am I comfortable? Probably the most important question to
ask yourself is whether you feel at ease with the veterinarian
you’re considering. You need to be able to communicate with
the vet, ask any questions that come to mind, and understand
the answers she gives you.
 Do I like the facility? Just looking at the veterinary clinic or
animal hospital where a veterinarian practices can help you
decide whether this vet is the right one for you and your pet.
Ask for a tour, and check to see whether the clinic is clean,
the staff is helpful, and — if the clinic has several vets — you
can see the same practitioner at every visit. Seeing the same
vet every time you visit means you’ll have a practitioner who
really knows you and your Beagle.
 Does the staff keep current? Veterinary medicine evolves at
lightning speed, with new treatments, techniques, and discov-
eries being unveiled almost constantly. Your Beagle’s vet
should stay on top of these developments. How can you tell
whether the vet you’re considering is staying ahead of the
curve? Look for certificates and diplomas on the walls. They
show that the vet is learning how to perform new treatments,
such as laser surgery (which is less painful to the dog and
shortens recovery time from surgery), or developing disci-
pline-specific specialties, such as dentistry or emergency
care. And make sure the clinic itself is certified. Look for a seal
that shows membership in the American Animal Hospital
Association (AAHA), a voluntary accreditation association for
animal hospitals and clinics.
 Is the location satisfactory? Notice that I use the word “satis-
factory,” not “convenient.” Although you want to find a clinic
or animal hospital that’s convenient to your home, the best
clinic isn’t necessarily the closest. A facility that offers great
customer service may be worth a little extra travel time.
 Does the clinic have procedures for dealing with after-hours
emergencies? Beagles and other pets have a maddening habit
of developing health crises at night, on weekends, or at other
times when most clinics are closed. Ask the clinic staff how
they cover after-hours emergencies. At minimum, the clinic
should have an after-hours telephone number for clients to
call and, if the vets can’t treat the problem, procedures to
refer you to a nearby emergency veterinary clinic.

Shopping for Beagle Basics
Sure, you could wait till you’re on your way home with your new
Beagle before you stock up on dog gear. However, sprinting in a
frenzied fashion up and down the aisles of your local pet super-
store and throwing stuff into the shopping cart while trying to
manage a Beagle you don’t know isn’t an effective way to shop for
Beagle belongings, much less start a good relationship with your
new friend. A better plan is to pick up everything he needs a few
days — or even weeks — before you bring him home.
Repeat after me: Crates aren’t cruel,
crates aren’t cruel . . .
I can hear you now. “A crate?” you say. “Don’t you mean a cage?
There’s no way I’m going to cage up my Beagle!”
But if your Beagle could talk, his opinions about crates may sur-
prise you. He’d probably tell you that a plastic or metal crate is
just what he needs to feel secure when he rests, sleeps, or just
wants to beat a retreat. Everyone, even the sociable Snoopy-dog,
needs a place to call his own — and in the Beagle’s case, a crate
fills the bill. Figure 5-1 shows a metal crate; Figure 5-2 shows a
plastic crate.
Figure 5-1: A metal crate contains your Beagle
but lets him see the world.
Chapter 5: Preparing for Your Beagle’s Arrival 63

Crates help people as much as they help pooches. That’s because
they’re a great place to keep your Beagle out of mischief when you
can’t watch him. Crates are also an invaluable housetraining aid,
because they teach a dog to hold his water (not to mention the
other stuff) until you can get him to his outdoor potty. Chapter 14
details exactly how crates can help civilize your Beagle’s bathroom
behavior.
Figure 5-2: A plastic crate encloses your Beagle
in a cozy, dark den.
When considering crates, either plastic or metal is fine. Bypass
mesh crates until you’re sure that your Beagle won’t chew through
the mesh! Consider size carefully, though. Any crate you choose
must be big enough for your dog to stand up, turn around, and
stretch out to sleep — but not so large that he can pee at one end
and sleep at the other.
The crate that’s big enough for an adult Beagle is too big for a
puppy. But you don’t need to buy a new crate every few weeks as
your puppy grows. Instead, consider buying a metal crate with a
divider. The divider restricts the area of the crate available to the
young puppy so the crate won’t be too big for him. As your puppy
grows, adjust the divider accordingly until he’s fully grown. At that
point, you won’t need the divider at all, but you will have saved
money by only having bought one crate.

Borrowing from baby:
Gates and pens
At times, you may want to limit your Beagle’s access to some areas
of your house without having to confine him to a crate. To that
end, baby gates and exercise pens (ex-pens for short) do a fine
job of keeping your dog contained without totally restricting his
movements.
Baby gates are available in pet stores and baby supply stores.
Gates come in several different styles:
 Pressure-mounted gates: These gates rely on pressure to
ensure that they adhere to the walls. They’re easier to install
than hardware gates, but they’re also easier for a rambunc-
tious Beagle to knock over. Some pressure-mounted gates
swing open; check the gate or the label on the gate’s packing
box for details.
 Hardware gates: These gates are very sturdy, but they offer
another advantage: They generally swing open, allowing you
to walk through the gate instead of having to hop over it (see
Figure 5-3).
 Wooden accordion-style gates: Don’t buy this type of gate at
a thrift store or yard sale. Such gates pose a strangulation
hazard to Beagles and young children.
No matter what style you choose, make sure that the gate has a
straight top edge (it will be safer for the puppy who wants to stand
on his hind legs and easier for you to hop over), and either rigid
metal bars or a mesh screen. If you choose a gate with metal bars,
make sure that it has a mesh cover so a puppy or dog can’t get his
head stuck between the bars.
You can also choose to keep your dog contained with an
exercise pen.
Ex-pens resemble children’s playpens — except ex-pens don’t have
floors or bottoms. Some are made from the same sort of wire used
in wire crates, but others are made from hard plastic. Many ex-
pens have eight panels, plus a door, but others such as the one in
Figure 5-4 have only six panels. Either way, they generally range
from 2 to 4 feet high and are available at pet supply stores.

Picking out dishes
Dog dishes come in a wide range of sizes and shapes — but for
a Beagle, the options are reasonably narrow, literally. A narrow,
deep bowl allows your Snoopy-dog to eat and drink with his ears
outside the bowl. As for the dish’s material, you have several
options:
 Stainless steel: Your best bet probably is a stainless steel
dish, because it’s easy to clean and can’t be demolished by a
teething puppy.
 Ceramic: Ceramic is also a good choice, as long as it’s not
imported. No, I’m not bashing foreign trade here; my concern
is that ceramic dishes manufactured outside the United States
may contain lead, which can be toxic to Beagles and their
people.
 Plastic: Plastic dishes are cheap and easy to clean, but can
cause some dogs to lose their nose pigment (the loss is tem-
porary; after you switch to a nonplastic dish, the pigment
should return) or to develop little pimples (yup, dogs can get
acne) on their chins.
Invest in three dog dishes: a water dish and one dish for each of
the two meals per day that you’ll feed your adult Beagle. That
way, you won’t have to wash a dish after every doggy meal. You
can just pop each dish into the dishwasher, run the dishwasher
at night, and — voilà! — have clean dishes at the ready the next
morning.
Chow time!
Plan on having a week’s worth of dog food on hand before you
bring your new Beagle home. What to buy? Ask the breeder, animal
shelter, or foster-care provider what they’ve been feeding your dog
and buy the same product. You may want to change food later — if
so, Chapter 8 will give you some ideas on what changes you may
want to make — but for now, at least, stick with what your dog’s
already eating. The transition to your home will be challenging
enough for your new friend; don’t ask him to deal with dietary
changes, too.
Chapter 5: Preparing for Your Beagle’s Arrival 67

Lay in a couple of 15-ounce cans of pumpkin — just straight pump-
kin, not prepared pumpkin pie filling — before you bring your
Beagle home. If your new dog’s stress results in overly loose or
overly hard stool, a dollop of pumpkin mixed in with his food can
rebalance his system in a jiffy.
This Beagle’s made for walkin’:
Collars and leashes
Abandon any thoughts you have of getting your Beagle to walk
beside you off leash, at least for the immediate future. The Beagle
is much more likely to obey his nose than to obey you — and if his
nose takes him in a direction away from you, it’s bye-bye, little
friend. To keep your dog securely tethered to you, you need to buy
him a collar and leash.
The collar holds not only the leash, but also the identification tag,
rabies inoculation tag, and license tag needed to keep your Beagle
legal. Stores offer plenty of collar styles to choose from, and
Chapter 15 discusses those options in detail. For now, though, all
you need is a soft nylon or thin leather buckle or snap collar. For
an adult Beagle, get a collar for 20- to 30-pound dog; for a puppy,
size down accordingly.
Chapter 15 also discusses leash options — but for now, opt for a 6-
foot leather leash. Nylon leashes are cheaper, but if your Beagle
decides to get in touch with his inner sled dog and pull you down
the street, the nylon could leave a nasty burn on your palm as the
leash crosses your hand. Leather is easier on the hands, and it
lasts longer, too.
Think twice — no, make that 20 times — about using a retractable
leash. These contraptions may give your dog the illusion of free-
dom because they allow him to wander up to 15 feet — maybe
even farther — away from you. However, many communities ban
the use of leashes that extend more than 6 feet, because unsus-
pecting pedestrians don’t always see the leashes and can easily
trip over them. In addition, the leash’s retractability encourages
your Beagle to pull you down the street as though he’s running a
one-dog chariot race straight out of the movie Ben-Hur. Trust me:
You don’t want to give your Beagle the means to exhibit any more
independence than he’s already likely to show!
Part II: Starting Life with Your Beagle 
68

The same is true of harnesses. Unless you use a special no-pull har-
ness (more about that in Chapter 15), you won’t have the control
you need to keep your Beagle from pulling. Harnesses are appro-
priate for a teeny-tiny dog who may injure his windpipe if sub-
jected to a leash and collar. But Beagles are stronger than that!
Grooming gear
Beagles require relatively little grooming equipment, but you need
to have a few basic items on hand for when your dog could use a
canine makeover. Put these items on your shopping list:
 Shampoo: A mild shampoo formulated just for dogs will give
your Beagle a pleasurable bath whenever he needs one. An
oatmeal or hypoallergenic shampoo is an especially good
choice. Don’t bother with flea shampoos; they’re much too
harsh for a Beagle’s tender skin — and your vet can offer far
better ways to rid your dog of fleas.
Don’t use your own shampoo on your Beagle. The stuff that
keeps your tresses gleaming is too harsh for his coat and skin.
 Brush: Either a soft bristle brush or rubber curry brush will
do the trick for the weekly brushings he’ll need.
 Nail clippers: Doggy nail clippers are the equipment of choice
for regular Beagle pedicures.
 Toothbrush and pet toothpaste: To keep your Beagle’s teeth
clean, pick up a doggy toothbrush (or soft child’s toothbrush)
and pet toothpaste. Don’t use human toothpaste, which can
upset your dog’s tummy.
Everything you need to know about grooming your Beagle is in
Chapter 10.
Clean-up equipment
As a responsible Beagle owner, you need to clean up any poop that
your dog deposits outdoors — and as a person who presumably
wants to keep a reasonably sanitary house, you need to clean up
your dog’s indoor bathroom boo-boos.
Chapter 5: Preparing for Your Beagle’s Arrival 69

For outdoor cleanup, all you really need is a goodly supply of plas-
tic grocery-size bags or larger. The scoop on cleaning up your
dog’s poop appears in Chapter 11.
Indoor cleanups require specialized products. Check out the
appropriate aisle in your local pet superstore, where you’ll find
a boatload of enzymatic cleaners that remove not only the stains
from your Beagle’s bathroom transgressions, but also the odors.
Chapter 14 has a thorough explanation of why odor removal is
crucial for housetraining to succeed.
Extra comforts of home
Of course you want to pamper your new pooch! Here are some
suggestions on stuff to buy to help you do just that:
 A crate pad: You wouldn’t want to sleep on a hard metal or
plastic surface, and your Beagle probably won’t want to,
either. A crate-sized foam mattress will give your dog a
comfy reason to love his den, which is a big plus while
you’re trying to housetrain him. Many of these pads are
also waterproof, which is another plus during the house-
training process if, for some reason, your Beagle has an
accident in his crate.
 A few toys: Most Beagles love toys of some sort, but you
may need to experiment for a while until you figure out
your own dog’s plaything preferences. Start with a few
inexpensive, durable items such as balls or rubber bones.
Other good toys are pooch puzzlers such as Kongs and
Busta Cubes in which you hide tasty treats for your Beagle
to ferret out.
Avoid toys that have parts (including squeakers) that are
small enough to swallow; are easily destroyed by canine
teeth; come with long strings that can get stuck in the
digestive tract (for example, rope toys); and resemble 
real-life objects that you don’t want your dog to chew on
(for example, a sock, shoe, or newspaper).
 A few treats: The food- and scent-obsessed Beagle responds
well to food rewards for learning basic doggy etiquette.
Chapters 8 and 15 give you the lowdown on giving treats
for tricks and just plain doing what you ask your Snoopy-dog
to do.

Designating Beagle Spaces
in Your Home
Getting Beagle gear is only half of what you need to do before you
bring your new family member home. The other half is making sure
that your home is ready for when the little hound crosses your
threshold for the first time.
Before your Beagle comes home, figure out where in your house
he’s going to be conducting the major activities in his life: sleeping,
eating, pooping, peeing, and playing. The sooner you determine
where you want him to do his thing — and where you don’t — the
smoother his transition into your household will be.
Note that in the previous paragraph I said “in your house.” That’s
because I strongly believe that Beagles — and all dogs, for that
matter — belong indoors with their families. The more time your
dog spends with you, the more bonded to you he will be. He’ll be
a better companion, too.
The Beagle boudoir
The best place for your Beagle to sleep is in the same room that
you sleep — and not just the first few nights, but every night you
and he are in the same house. Beagles are pack animals, which
means they want to sleep in close proximity to other family mem-
bers. Your Beagle, as independent as he is, will still count on you to
feed him, play with him, train him, exercise him, and take good
care of him. He’ll want to be with you as much as possible, even if
he won’t necessarily want to do everything you ask of him.
Sleeping in the same room that you do gives your dog a chance to
be with you and your scent for an extended period of time. Repeated
nights together help your Beagle build trust and confidence in you,
and also help him feel that he really belongs in his new pack.
Many people, especially first-time dog owners, think that inviting a
dog into one’s bedroom is the height of lunacy. Their objections
generally take the form of plaintive questions such as:
 What if he’s noisy and won’t let me sleep? No matter where
your Beagle sleeps, he’ll probably be noisy, at least for the
first few nights. He’ll whine, he’ll bark, and he may even howl.
Chapter 5: Preparing for Your Beagle’s Arrival 71

But can you blame him? He’s in a strange place with people he
doesn’t know. If he’s a puppy, he’s away from his mom and sib-
lings for the very first time in his young life. Either way, he’s
scared and needs comforting.
Put him in his crate, bring the crate into your bedroom as
close as possible to your bed, and extend your fingers down
from your bed toward the crate door so he can sniff them. I
guarantee that your Beagle’s nocturnal vocalizing will be
much less than it would be if you banish the poor little guy to
the other end of the house just so you can get some zzz’s.
 What if he has an accident? Any accident anywhere should
draw the same response: Just clean it up. But you can limit
the likelihood of accidents in your bedroom by taking your
new Beagle out to potty just before bedtime, putting him in
his crate at night, and, if he’s a puppy, taking him outside to
pee once or twice during the middle of the night. Chapter 14
explains how to prevent accidents anywhere in the house.
Don’t let your Beagle sleep on your bed with you — at least
not until you’re sure that he’s fully housetrained, as described
in Chapter 14.
 What if we’re, um, doing something? Please. Who’s your
Beagle going to tell? Put him in his crate and enjoy yourselves!
He’ll probably sleep through the whole thing.
The doggy dining area
The kitchen is probably the best place for your Beagle’s dining area.
You’ll undoubtedly fix his meals in the kitchen, so feeding him there
means fewer steps for you. Spillage doesn’t ruin a bare kitchen floor
the way it might ruin a living-room carpet. The kitchen also is the
center of most human household action, so your sociable Snoopy-
dog won’t feel that he’s missing anything important just because
he’s stopping to have a meal. That said, your Beagle should be able
to eat all of his meals without being disturbed. In other words, no
matter where your little hound eats, don’t let anyone — kids, other
pets, even adults — bug him. To create just the right atmosphere
for your Beagle’s dining pleasure, turn to Chapter 8.
The Beagle bathroom
The best place for your Beagle to do his duty is outdoors, but not
far away from your house. If you have a backyard, select an area
that’s a few feet away from the house and take him there each and
every time he needs a bathroom break. If you don’t have a yard,
walk with him on the sidewalk and let him eliminate on the median
Part II: Starting Life with Your Beagle 
72

strip between the sidewalk and street — taking care to clean up
immediately afterward. No sidewalk? Find a small park or lot where
you can take your friend and clean up after he unloads.
Don’t take a Beagle puppy to areas where other dogs eliminate
until he’s had all of his puppy shots. Until his immunization pro-
gram is complete, he’s vulnerable to contracting diseases, such as
distemper, parvovirus, and intestinal parasites, all of which may
lay waiting in the droppings of infected dogs. Chapter 11 gives
more information on immunizing your Beagle.
The Beagle hangout zone
Giving your Beagle the run of the house while you’re not home isn’t
a good idea, especially when he still holds newcomer status. A
better option is to escort your Beagle to his cozy crate if you’ll be
gone for just a couple of hours. Longer jaunts away from the house
require that you set up another place for your dog to stay until you
return; possible options include a laundry room or the kitchen. Put
his crate in that new place, set up baby gates, or shut the door and
leave him a couple of safe toys to play with. By taking these precau-
tions, you’ll greatly reduce the likelihood that your Beagle will chew
on your upholstery, tear down the wallpaper, or otherwise trash
your domicile before you return.
No-Beagles zones
Picking the places you don’t want your Beagle to go is really a
matter of personal preference. In my household, the dog-free zones
include our living room furniture, all human beds, and my hus-
band’s art studio. Think of a few areas where you positively,
absolutely, never, ever want your Beagle to be, and take steps to
restrict his access to them. The following section offers ideas on
exactly how to restrict your dog’s access to areas and items that
may get him into trouble.
Beagle-Proofing Your Home
and Yard
Every child needs boundaries in order to thrive and grow to be a
healthy, well-balanced adult — and in that respect, Beagles are no
different than human kids. Your Beagle needs clear, consistent
boundaries not only to stay in your good graces, but also just to
stay safe.
Chapter 5: Preparing for Your Beagle’s Arrival 73

Securing the perimeter
Those boundaries start with the outdoors: specifically, with
enclosing part or all of your yard so it’s virtually escape-proof.
Fencing comes in a wide variety of materials and price ranges, but
the most important consideration for the fence-building Beagle
owner is that whatever you build be impermeable. Ask your local
hardware store or fencing professional what materials best keep
Beagles on their own turf. And after you or the contractor start to
install the fence, make very sure that no openings or crevices exist
above or below ground that may allow your Beagle to make his bid
for freedom. And check at least weekly after installation is com-
plete: Beagles are masters at fashioning creative escape routes by
digging under or chewing holes in fences.
If you choose not to install a fence, don’t let your Beagle out in
your yard without you holding the other end of a leash. No matter
how much your little hound loves you, he’ll love the great out-
doors more. If he gets the chance to explore the world beyond his
backyard without being tethered to you, he will jump at it — and
the results could be tragic. Some dog owners install an electronic
fence thinking it will protect their Beagle just as well as a tradi-
tional fence. The sidebar, “How about electronic fences?”, explains
why you shouldn’t opt for this high-tech solution.
Part II: Starting Life with Your Beagle 
74
How about electronic fences?
For many Beagle owners, the prospect of installing conventional fencing either
offends their visual tastes or wreaks havoc on their household budgets. Either way,
electronic fencing appears to provide an attractive, cost-saving alternative. After
installing underground wiring around the perimeter of your property, you buckle a
special collar around your dog’s neck. If he crosses your property line, he receives
a mild electrical shock.
Unfortunately, all too many Beagles and other breeds venture beyond their prop-
erty lines despite getting shocked — but then refuse to come back to their domiciles
because they don’t want another mini-jolt. And that’s not the only potential problem
with electronic fencing; another is that other dogs, animals, or people can cross
freely into your yard, but your Beagle can’t get away from them unless he’s willing
to risk getting shocked. In other words, electronic fencing can make your dog more
vulnerable to being attacked or stolen.
The bottom line: Don’t rely on electronic fencing to contain your little hound. The
Beagle who gets lost could be your own.

Even though you’ve provided an outdoor play area for your Beagle,
don’t leave him outdoors unattended. The great outdoors, even
within the confines of your yard, offers too many hazards for
your little hound — hazards that range from dangerous plants
to kids’ toys to uncovered swimming pools. When your Beagle’s
outside, be there with him — or at least be watching him from a
window.
Conducting a sweep
Inside the house, your main task is to make sure that your Beagle
can’t come into contact with anything that could get him into
trouble or, worse, jeopardize his safety. The prudent dog owner
takes steps to Beagle-proof his home before the little hound actu-
ally sets paw in the house. Here are some tips to do just that:
 Get down to his level. Assess the field from your Beagle’s per-
spective: down low and on all fours. Get down on your hands
and knees, and crawl throughout your home’s interior so you
can get a pup’s-eye view of what will attract his attention or
land him in trouble.
 Stash your stuff. Shoes, socks, underwear, kids’ toys, books,
and magazines are all fodder for a curious Beagle’s teeth.
Keep your Beagle from shredding your stuff by putting it out
of view and out of reach. Put clothes in closed closets and
drawers, place books and magazines out of reach, and cut off
access to any items that you don’t want your little hound to
find during one of his many search-and-destroy missions.
 Batten down the wires. Dangling electrical cords could entice
a curious Beagle who wants to paw or chew on them. Fasten
them to the floor and/or wall with duct tape.
 Block off staircases. A tumble down some stairs can break a
Beagle’s leg or other bones. Close any doors that lead to flights
of stairs; if that’s not possible, put baby gates at both ends of
the staircase. After your Beagle gets used to your home and
learns to navigate stairs, you can probably get rid of the gates.
 Secure the cabinets. Install door guards to keep your Beagle
out of cabinets that contain household cleansers or other sub-
stances that may be dangerous to him. Door guards are avail-
able at any toy or baby supply store.
Chapter 5: Preparing for Your Beagle’s Arrival 75

 Lids down! I’m sorry to have to tell male readers that leaving
the toilet seat up is not an option if you share your home
with a Beagle. A Beagle puppy who finds his way into an
open toilet could drown — and no Beagle benefits from
drinking water out of the toilet. Bottom line: Keep the seat
down at all times.
 No trashing. Dogs love to dive into wastebaskets to ferret
out undesirable goodies. Make sure your Beagle can’t find
any. Empty your wastebaskets often, and/or limit his access
to them by closing doors or moving the baskets off the floor.
Ladies, not to get gross, but many dogs love the scent of used
feminine hygiene products. Wrap used maxi-pads, tampon
inserters, and pantiliners securely with toilet paper before
stashing them in the trash — and make sure your dog can’t
get to the basket you’ve stashed them in.
Planning Mayhem Management
Take a deep breath, look around your home and savor the moment.
It may be the last peaceful moment you’ll have in your house for
quite a while. That’s because the first few days of having a Beagle
in your home inevitably will be somewhat chaotic. The newcomer
won’t have a clue as to what’s going on, other than that he’s in
someplace new that bears exploring. Meanwhile, the current resi-
dents — human and nonhuman alike — are struggling to figure out
what to do to keep the new dog off their turf or get some love time
in with the way-too-cute Snoopy-dog. Still, you can limit the chaos
by mapping out a first-day mayhem management plan. Here’s what
to consider:
 Who’s the boss? Figure out who makes the rules, who con-
trols the interactions between your Beagle and the rest of
your family, and who does which dog-care jobs. If you’re the
decision-maker — well, congrats. You’re top dog.
 Where will the other critters be? Plan how your current pets
will meet the new critter in the house. Do you want them to be
out of the house until your Beagle can settle in? Will the cats
be at large or confined to a small room away from the new
family member? Check out Chapter 6, which offers tips for
managing your new dog’s first encounter with the other non-
human members of your pack.
Part II: Starting Life with Your Beagle 
76

 How will your kids meet the dog? Depending on their ages,
you may want them to wait until you bring the new dog to
them, or let them greet the newcomer immediately. Consider,
too, whether you want to let them bring any of their friends
over to meet the Beagle — and if so, how many and for how
long. Stumped? Hop on over to Chapter 6.
Have a conference with your kids before you bring your
Beagle home. Help them understand that your new puppy or
dog may be feeling a little scared at first, and that he needs
everyone to stay calm and give him some space for a while.
Then, make some rules — no screaming, shouting, or squeal-
ing; no roughhousing; gentle petting only — and enforce them.
 Does everyone know what will happen when the Beagle
comes home? Make sure everyone in the household — the
kids, your roommates, and your partner — knows what you
plan to do when you bring the Snoopy-dog home. Will you
give him a bathroom break first? How long will you let him
explore the house? How will you handle the introductions to
the other animal members? When everyone knows what’s
going to happen, you stand a better chance of keeping
mayhem to a minimum. Chapter 6 offers suggestions to help
you do just that.

A
t last the big day has arrived: Today you bring your new
Beagle home. The first 24 hours or so with your Beagle can be
a dream come true or an absolute nightmare, depending on how
you handle some potentially tricky arrival maneuvers. This chap-
ter gives you the scoop on how to not only survive but thrive
during your Snoopy-dog’s first day and night in your abode.
Picking Up Your Beagle
Bringing home your little darling requires more than just motoring
to the breeder, animal shelter, or foster-care provider, stashing the
Beagle in the front seat, and boogeying back home. A little preplan-
ning makes the trip a lot less stressful for both your new dog and
yourself. Here are some suggestions on what to do before and
during the trip home.
What (and whom) to bring
Driving home with a new Beagle puppy or dog can be a real chal-
lenge. Your new friend may be a little confused and more than a
little carsick. She’s very likely to need a bathroom break if you
have to travel very far from her old home to her new one. And

although you may be tempted to keep your little one in your lap
while you drive, reconsider. If you have an accident and the air bag
deploys, the impact could kill your dog. By the same token, letting
her crawl around the back seat while you drive in the front seat is
almost as bad an idea as having her in your lap. If you stop sud-
denly or have an accident, your new pet could literally fly off the
seat and into you, resulting in serious injury to you both.
You can prevent these and other calamities if you bring a few
simple items with you when you pick up your Beagle. Here’s what
to take with you before you take off:
 Another person: Bringing along a second person — prefer-
ably over the age of 10 — can make the drive home a lot
easier for all concerned. Your new dog can lie on that person’s
lap, allowing you to concentrate on driving safely. If you’d
rather be the designated lap, then let the other person drive,
assuming he has a license.
If you’re driving, have the other person sit in the back seat
with your Beagle. That way, if the dog gets squirmy or escapes
from the designated lap, the dog is less likely to end up on the
gear box, the gas pedal, or your lap. If the other person is driv-
ing, you should sit in the back seat with your Beagle.
 Several towels: Your Beagle may get carsick during the jour-
ney home. To limit the damage to your car or your human
companion’s clothes, bring some towels and have your friend
place one across his lap. That way, if your dog tosses her
cookies, the cookies can be easily whisked away. And don’t
bother pulling over if your dog starts to upchuck; she’ll be
done before you turn off the motor.
 Collar and leash: A drive of more than an hour may be too
long for your confused or nervous new dog to hold her water
or the other stuff. Having her collar and leash along makes a
midjourney bathroom break both easy and safe. Make sure
that you put the new collar on the dog before you head for
home.
 A couple of plastic bags: Cleaning up your dog’s poop is
essential to being a good dog owner — and you should get in
the habit of doing your dog’s dirty work on the trip home. For
the poop on how to pick up poop, check out Chapter 11.
 A roll of paper towels: You’ll be glad you brought this item
along if your little sweetie has a bathroom boo-boo or
upchucks in your car.
 A crate: If you can’t bring another person with you — or if 
the only other people who can come are your very young 
Part II: Starting Life with Your Beagle 
80

children — bring your Beagle’s crate. Place the crate in the
back seat and secure it with a seat belt. Stick a crate pad or a
few towels inside to create a cozy nest for your four-legged
traveler.
A doggy seat belt is a great safety option for your Beagle —
but not necessarily on the day you bring her home. These
devices can be a little bit daunting to use at first, and may add
to any stress you and the dog already are feeling. However,
having a canine seat belt is a great idea for future trips. Get
the goods on these devices by checking out Chapter 13.
 A chew toy: Having a durable, medium-sized toy to chew on
can distract your Beagle from any apprehension she may 
feel as she leaves her old home and moves to her new home
with you.
Receiving the necessary papers
Hooray! You’ve made it to the breeder, shelter, or foster home, and
you’ve got your new friend. Before the two of you embark on your
journey home, however, you should receive a few additional items:
 A signed contract: No matter where or from whom you adopt
your new Beagle, you should receive a document that trans-
fers ownership of the dog to you. The contract also should
specify your obligations and those of the individual or institu-
tion from whom you’re acquiring the dog.
 Your dog’s health record: The breeder, shelter, or rescue
group should provide you with a copy of your Beagle’s health
record. This document should include when she was born
and/or arrived at the shelter or foster home, and the veteri-
nary care she has received, such as immunizations, spaying or
neutering, deworming, and/or other procedures.
 Some food: A breeder or rescue volunteer may also give you a
few days’ supply of the food she’s been feeding your Beagle. If
you aren’t given any food, at least ask what your new dog’s
been eating so you can pick up the same product (if you
haven’t done so already).
 A scent cloth: To get your Beagle puppy’s housetraining off to
a good start, consider asking her breeder for one more item: a
paper towel that’s been scented with a bit of your pup’s urine.
This pretreated sheet will speed up your pooch’s potty-train-

Chapter  6: Welcoming Your Beagle Home 81

From there to here: The trip home
After you have your four-legged friend safely ensconced on a
human lap or in her new crate in your car, you’re ready to roll. If
your trip home takes more than an hour, give your pooch a pit stop
midway through the journey — or whenever you notice that your
doggy passenger is getting restless.
Just find a grassy place and pull over. Put a leash on your Beagle
before you open the car door, and then take her to the spot where
you want her to do her business. To help her figure out where that
spot is, place the prescented paper towel that you got from her
breeder, shelter, or foster-care provider on the spot where you
want her to go — and then let her unload on it.
Make sure this spot is away from any other doggy deposits. Until
your dog is fully immunized, she’s vulnerable to picking up nasty
diseases from other canines — and stool is a prime transmission
vehicle. Contact with stool can also put your pooch in contact with
roundworms and other parasites.
If your Beagle poops or pees, tell her in a soft, cheerful voice what
a good girl she is, and take a minute or two to pet her. Use one of
the plastic bags you brought to clean up any poop, and drop the
bag into a trash can.
If your Beagle puppy pees, wipe her urinary area very gently with a
clean paper towel, and then put that towel into a plastic bag.
You’ve just made a brand new scent cloth that will come in handy
when the two of you arrive home.
After your little love-fest, take your new Beagle back to the potty
spot to give her another chance to do her doo. Maybe she will,
maybe she won’t — but at least you’ve given her a chance. Either
way, you can then continue on to your home and know that you’ve
already started to not only teach her basic bathroom manners, but
also form a lifelong bond.
We’re Here! Arriving Home
You’ve truly arrived: You and your new Beagle buddy are about to
cross the threshold into your abode. But before you open the door
and are greeted by the other members of your household, consider
how you’re going to help your Snoopy-dog handle the first few
hours of life in your household.
Part II: Starting Life with Your Beagle 
82

First things first: A potty break
When the two of you arrive at your home, don’t go inside right
away. Car rides often prompt a dog to open her floodgates almost
immediately after she emerges from the vehicle. You can use this
tendency to continue your Beagle’s introduction to housetraining.
As soon as you get out of the car, leash up your little darling and
either carry her or walk her to the potty area you’ve selected
(Chapter 5 gives you the scoop on where that area should be).
Place the scent cloth that you created during the trip home on top
of the spot where you’d like her to potty. Let her sniff it — and tell
her what a good girl she is when she decides to unload atop it.
If you haven’t already made a scent cloth for your puppy — per-
haps because the trip was very short — make one now. The previ-
ous section tells you how.
If she doesn’t go, be patient. Give her a few minutes to explore her
new bathroom; if she hasn’t done the doo already, she probably
will shortly after beginning her investigations.
Even if your Beagle does take a whiz or make a deposit, don’t bring
her inside your house immediately afterward. Many Beagle pup-
pies and even some adult Beagles may need to make multiple
deposits or take several whizzes before they’re totally empty.
Checking out the new digs
When you’re reasonably sure she’s done, take your Beagle inside,
and let her explore your domicile for a little while off lead. If at all
possible, keep the kids and other family members out of her way
for a few minutes and avoid fussing over her yourself — just let her
do her thing in peace. At the same time, though, watch your little
one closely to see if she needs to pee or poop again. Signs of an
imminent bathroom event include a sudden stop in her explo-
rations, an equally sudden onset of intense sniffing, and walking in
ever-tighter circles.
If you see any such signs, get your dog back out to the potty spot
she used before. The scent from her previous anointing or deposit
almost certainly will prompt an encore. When that happens, praise
her for doing her business where she’s supposed to.
Chapter  6: Welcoming Your Beagle Home 83

Meeting the rest of the pack
After your new Beagle has had a few minutes to explore her new
domicile and, if necessary, take another bathroom break, she’s
ready to meet the other members of her family. Make these intro-
ductions carefully so you minimize the stress on everyone. You
want these initial meetings to be positive and happy; they’ll set the
tone for your new friend’s future interactions with her housemates.
The human members: No trauma please!
The other adults in your household, if any, should know how to
handle themselves around a Beagle or other small dog, but your
kids could be another matter. They’re undoubtedly thrilled with
the arrival of this new family member, and they probably can’t wait
to cuddle and hug her. However, they may not know their own
strength, especially if they’re under the age of 6. They may think
they’re giving your Beagle lots of love, but your Beagle may feel as
though she’s just met a couple of boa constrictors.
As a parent, it’s your job to make sure that neither your children
nor your Beagle are traumatized by their initial meeting. If you
haven’t had a family conference with your kids to explain the
ground rules — no yelling, screaming or shouting; no rough han-
dling; no squeezing; gentle petting only — have one now. Explain to
your kids that your new dog is probably scared and almost cer-
tainly doesn’t understand what’s happening to her. Make sure that
the kids give your Beagle some space while she explores, and allow
her to have time to nap and just relax.
Never, ever leave any dog — Beagle or otherwise — alone with a
child under the age of 6. Even the gentlest Beagle may nip a small
child that pulls her tail or yanks her ears. Kids under 6 often don’t
understand that a Beagle is a living creature with real feelings, not
a stuffed toy that just happens to walk and bark. For the sake of
your dog and your kids, stick around to make sure that everybody
stays out of harm’s way.
As for your neighbors, the best course of action is inaction, at least
for the first couple of days after your dog comes home. Even if
your wonderful neighbors want to give your puppy a welcome-
home party, decline politely. Your Snoopy-dog’s got as much as she
can handle just meeting you and your family. Let her get used to
life within your household before she meets people and other indi-
viduals outside your four walls.
Part II: Starting Life with Your Beagle 
84

The canine members: Don’t let the fur fly!
The other dogs in your family may not be totally thrilled to meet
the newest doggy family member. For that reason, first meetings
are best accomplished in neutral territory, such as a park or some-
one else’s fenced yard. Let the dogs have a chance to sniff each
other and check each other out.
Let your dogs sniff and lick each other’s bottoms, even if the sight
of such activity grosses you out. Such interactions are proper
pooch protocol — kind of the canine version of humans shaking
hands.
Keep the dogs on leash, but don’t tighten up. Loose leashes keep
the doggies relaxed.
After you’re sure that everybody likes each other — or at least will
tolerate each other — walk the entire pack home. Continue to mon-
itor their behavior; use baby gates to separate them if necessary.
Meanwhile, make sure that you don’t neglect the dogs you already
have in order to lavish attention on the newcomer!
The rest of the critter crew
Without a doubt, you’re thrilled to be adding a Beagle to your
family, but don’t expect your resident kitty or other critters to
share your enthusiasm. Exercise some caution, though, and
chances are you’ll achieve mutual tolerance, if not mutual 
admiration.
Introducing your new Beagle to your cat requires that you show
some respect for the kitty having been in your home first. Place
your Beagle in her crate, and let Fluffy the feline investigate the
newcomer and her environs.
If no fur flies, and the hisses or barks are minimal, hold your Beagle
on your lap and let your kitty approach if she chooses — or run in
the other direction if she prefers. Either choice is fine as long as
nobody’s getting hurt.
Continue to monitor both animals closely until you’re absolutely
sure that they’ll co-exist in peace, or that one can safely escape 
the other. For those times that you can’t supervise, keep them 
separated — either behind closed doors or with baby gates — to
keep them from fighting like, well, cats and dogs.
Chapter  6: Welcoming Your Beagle Home 85

Other animals such as rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, birds, and
reptiles generally spend most of their time in cages. When your
Beagle’s around, that’s where they need to stay. A dog has a strong
instinct to chase and catch prey, which is what these critters will
look like to her (especially if the critter is a rabbit). The result,
unfortunately, will probably be the critter’s demise. Allow your
critter floor time only when your Beagle’s not around.
Introducing (or re-introducing) 
the crate
If you’re lucky, your new Snoopy-dog has already seen the inside of
a crate and will welcome a chance to spend a little alone time
there. But that’s not always the case. Some dogs — Beagles or oth-
erwise — have no idea that crates even exist. Others have gotten
up close and personal with crates, but need some time to appreci-
ate the virtues of having one’s own den. These latter dogs often are
adults who’ve spent way too much time inside crates and have,
understandably, come to view these structures as puppy prisons
rather than as doggy dens. You don’t want your Beagle to view her
crate in such a negative light, because if she hates her crate,
housetraining and traveling with your canine companion could
become very complicated.
Such complications don’t have to happen. By carefully introducing
your Beagle to her home-within-your-home, you can teach her to
view her crate as the divine doggy den it’s supposed to be. Here’s
how to help your Beagle consider her crate a great place to chill:
 Start with an open-door policy. Successful crate introduction
is a gradual process that forestalls any events that could
spook your little hound. One such event is the accidental clo-
sure or slamming of the crate door before she’s fully accli-
mated to the crate. Prevent such events by tying the door
open and leaving it that way until your dog ventures into her
crate under her own steam.
 Let her check out the crate. Let your Beagle walk around and
sniff the exterior of the crate. After a couple of minutes of
investigation, place a treat or toy just inside the crate door. If
she enters the crate to retrieve the goody, praise her extrava-
gantly and let her enjoy the treat or toy. If she’s unsure about
setting foot in the crate, encourage her to try — but don’t
force her. Allow your dog to decide when she’s ready to enter
her crate on her own. When she does, tell her what a very
good girl she is.

86

Chapter  6: Welcoming Your Beagle Home 87
Playing the name game
If you haven’t done so already, now’s the time for you to give your Beagle a name.
Your Snoopy-dog is a distinct individual and should sport a moniker that reflects her
endearing, irrepressible individuality. For adult dogs adopted from shelters or rescue
groups, a new name can take on an added significance: The new appellation
reflects the dog’s new life in a happy household.
But coming up with the right name for your little hound may be more of a challenge
than you anticipated. To help you negotiate those challenges and come up with a
name that truly fits your magnificent canine companion, consider the following 
suggestions:
Pick a name that says something about your pooch. For example, a good name for
a Beagle might be Elvis, reflecting The King’s classic song “You Ain’t Nothin’ but a
Hound Dog.”
Choose a name that’s easy to learn. Most experts suggest limiting a name to one or
two syllables. Such names take less time for a dog to recognize than a longer one
does — and will be easier for your kids to use, too.
Pick a name your dog will grow into. Sure, calling your Beagle puppy Baby Snooks
sounds cute now, but that name will sound doggone undignified when your puppy
reaches adulthood.
Avoid sound-alike names. Names that sound like either the names of other people
in your house or common commands will confuse everyone in your home, includ-
ing your Beagle. For example, the name “Kit” wouldn’t work for a dog, because it
sounds too much like the word “sit.” Similarly, if your husband’s name is Manny,
don’t name your dog Fanny.
Don’t choose a name associated with negative behavior. Prime examples here:
aggressive names for dogs. In other words, don’t name your Beagle “Killer.” And
even if your Beagle has had an accident or two, avoid calling her “Piddle-puss.”
Pick a name you can use in public. Okay, okay — your Beagle has made an unau-
thorized deposit in the middle of your Berber carpet. Worse, you have tween-agers
who think potty humor is the greatest thing going, and they want to immortalize that
deposit by christening your Beagle with a name that rhymes with “sit.” Tell them
no. If they accuse you of being an uptight fuddy-duddy, refer them to the “Avoid
sound-alike names” suggestion.
Google for some ideas. The World Wide Web has a gazillion sites that list common
dog names. Just type “common dog names” into a search engine and you’ll come
up with scores of sites that are stuffed to the gills with suggestions.
Follow the leaders. If you can’t come up with something suitable on your own, con-
sider what’s worked for other people and pooches. For example, PR Newswire
reports that the most popular names for dogs in 2005 were Max, Bailey, Buddy,
Molly, Maggie, Lucy, Daisy, Bella, Jake, and Rocky.

 Shut the door — but not for long. When your Beagle consis-
tently chooses to enter the crate to retrieve a treat or toy,
take the next step: shutting the door quietly for just a few sec-
onds. While the door is shut, praise her, then open the door
and coax her out. Praise her again and give her another treat.
Repeat this sequence, gradually increasing the time the door
remains closed, until your dog stays calmly in the crate for
five minutes or so.
 Leave the room. When your dog can spend five minutes in
her crate without getting hysterical, try leaving the room
while she’s inside her little den. Lure her into the crate with
either a safe chew toy or several treats (not just one). When
she’s in, shut the door quietly and leave the room for just a
minute. When those 60 seconds are up, come back and see
how she’s faring. If she’s content, leave again and come back
in a few minutes. Continue checking until she’s finished her
chewing or eating, or acts restless or distressed. At that point,
let her out of the crate and praise her for her remarkable
achievement. Keep practicing until she can stay in her crate
alone for about 30 minutes.
Surviving the First Night
The first night or two home with your new Beagle can be, well,
challenging. Your friend is likely to have difficulty settling down for
a good night’s sleep in her new home. And if she has difficulty,
you’re likely to have difficulty as well. But before you get too frus-
trated with your sleepless sidekick, consider why she may be
having trouble sleeping.
Yes, your new dog is beginning a wonderful life in a fabulous new
home with you — but she hasn’t had time to realize how terrific
this new phase of her life is going to be. If she’s a puppy, this is her
very first night away from the only home she’s ever known. Gone
are her mama and brothers and sisters, not to mention all the
sights and smells she’s grown accustomed to. Instead, she’s all by
her lonesome in a strange new place. And even an adult Beagle
may have some issues the first few nights. She may be wondering
what’s going to happen next after having endured one or more
moves to new homes, a shelter, and/or foster care.
Understanding what your Beagle is going through can help you
respond with kindness and sympathy to her bedtime issues.
Happily, too, that same kindness and sympathy also can help you
keep those nighttime cries and whimpers to a minimum. Here are
some suggestions.
Part II: Starting Life with Your Beagle 
88

Keep your Beagle with you . . .
Yes, you’ll be tempted to put your noisy Beagle and her crate in the
kitchen, basement, or laundry room so her nighttime vocalizing
doesn’t keep you awake. But having to sleep all alone in a strange
place will only worsen her distress. Better to keep your Beagle with
you — and if you do it right, you’ll not only reduce her need to
vocalize but also help her realize that you’re her new best friend.
Just pull your Beagle’s crate close to your bed — close enough so
you can dangle your fingers right outside the door. Such close
proximity allows your new family member to see you, smell you,
and hear you breathe — all of which helps reassure her that she’s
not alone and that you’re there to take care of her. If your Beagle
sleeps in a wire crate, you might want to drape a towel or sheet
over three sides to block out light or other distractions.
. . . But keep your bed to yourself
You may think that bringing your canine companion up on your
bed to snuggle with you will help calm her even more. And you’re
probably right. However, by inviting your dog up on your bed, you
may open a Pandora’s box of other problems For one thing, she
may have a bathroom accident on your bed. In addition, she may
become confused as to who really is top dog in your pack. So let
your little darling stay in her crate. Bringing your Beagle close to
you at night doesn’t mean that you should surrender your per-
sonal boundaries completely! Chapter 5 offers suggestions on
where your Beagle should sleep.
Play some (not so) funky music
Soothing music can go a long way toward helping your four-legged
friend relax. Think classical or New Age fare: Vivaldi (not Beethoven
or Wagner, please!) or Enya or something else along those lines is
perfect. You may find yourself falling asleep faster, too.
Use your hands
If your little one is still fussing, consider using your hands to help
her settle down. No, this doesn’t mean using your hands to open
the crate door and scoop your Beagle up and under the covers.
Instead, try the following:
Chapter  6: Welcoming Your Beagle Home 89

 Keep it dangling: Your hand, that is. Dangle your hand in
front of the crate door or slats so your dog can sniff and
maybe even lick it. This superclose proximity to your scent
and your person can help even the most unhappy new puppy
feel better and settle down to sleep.
 Give a pat: To the crate, not the canine. If your dog still
refuses to wrap up her nighttime concert or otherwise won’t
settle down, give the top of the crate a little pat and tell her
“Jessie (or whatever her name is), go to sleep.” This maneu-
ver works better if you’ve chosen a plastic crate rather than a
wire crate for your dog, because the plastic crate has a solid
surface that makes a sound when patted.
Have your shoes ready
If your Beagle’s whining or restlessness awakens you from a sound
slumber, she probably needs a bathroom break. Grab your shoes,
her collar and leash, and your coat, and take her outside to the
designated potty area. As she poops or pees, praise her extrava-
gantly — but then go back to bed. Stand firm if she thinks now’s
the time to play. Give in to her playtime invitation now and you’ll
have a hard time convincing her a few nights from now that the
two of you need to get some sleep.
Keep your outdoor gear close by the first few nights your Beagle is
with you. You’ll get her outside more quickly, thus preventing more
than a few potty accidents. Few aspects of dog ownership are
worse than cleaning up dog doo in the middle of the night!
Be patient
Repeat after me: This won’t last forever, this won’t last forever . . . 
I promise you that your Beagle will learn to sleep through the
night. After a few nights she’ll decide that sleeping in a soft warm
doggy den next to you beats nighttime concerts anytime! In the
meantime, do what you can to help her feel that she can count on
you to be there for her and help her through this transition from
old to new.

Friendship

 Making friends with your Beagle

 Establishing a daily schedule
 Launching your Beagle’s social life
 Coping with your Beagle’s issues
T
he next few days can be a lovely time as you and your new
Beagle get to know each other. For your Beagle, this is when he
begins to learn the lay of the land, including how things work in his
new home and who takes care of him (that would be you). For you,
these days are when you need to attend to certain details, such as
that first veterinary exam, establishing your dog’s daily routine,
laying the groundwork for training, and — most important of all —
falling in love with your Beagle.
Bonding with Your Beagle
The biggest reason to get a Beagle — or, for that matter, any dog —
is to build an attachment to him that enhances both your life and
his. Why else would you agree to clean up Beagle poop, risk damage
to your furniture, and experience the dubious pleasures of hound
dog concerts? Simple. You want to have a loyal friend who worships
the ground you walk on, and lets you know he worships you every
time he looks up at you adoringly with those big, soulful eyes of his.
But this attachment doesn’t develop automatically. Bonding with
your Beagle results only when you commit yourself to spending
time with him and teaching him what he needs to know to be a
happy household member. Doing both tasks with a generosity of

heart and spirit will sooner or later (hopefully, sooner) result in
your falling in love with each other.
Jump-starting the bonding process
Your Beagle is relatively independent, as dogs go. But he’s also a
social creature. He loves being with people. He has his own ideas
about what he wants to do — but chances are whatever he wants
to do doesn’t call for solitude. He wants a partner in crime, or at
least an audience.
And although the Beagle may be an independent, even stubborn
individual, he can’t get along without you. He needs you. You pro-
vide the food, water, and shelter that he requires to survive. You can
take advantage of this dependence to bind him to you — and, in the
process, you’ll find that you’re also binding yourself to him. When
the love flows both ways, the real joy of Beagle ownership begins.
Need some ideas on how to jump-start the bonding process? Start
with these:
 Commit some time. Plan on taking a few days off — or, at the
very least, a weekend — to acclimate your Beagle to life in
your household and to acclimate yourself to living with your
Beagle.
 Forget business as usual. Don’t try too hard to keep up your
usual routines these first few days. Immerse yourself in Beagle
care and Beagle love. There’s time enough to get back to every-
day life. Enjoy these precious new days with your little hound.
 Keep your sense of humor. Your Beagle is a canine clown. As
he gets used to his interesting new home, he will look for
ways to entertain himself. His explorations may include diving
into wastebaskets, shredding magazines left on coffee tables,
running off with a family member’s lingerie, and other creative
diversions. You can view these sparks of mischief as annoy-
ing, and no one would blame you. But a better approach — for
the sake of your sanity, not to mention your bond with your
Beagle — is to laugh at his antics, even as you take steps to
ensure that he has as few opportunities as possible to indulge
in those antics.
Minimize the hassles that often accompany life with a hound
dog by keeping your home as Beagle-proofed as possible.
Keep drawers, doors, and closets closed; place wastebaskets
beyond your Beagle’s reach; and remove stray items from
coffee tables and other furnishings. For more Beagle-proofing
tips, see Chapter 6.
Part II: Starting Life with Your Beagle 
92

 Tether him to you. Help your Beagle learn to look to you for
what he needs by keeping him with you whenever possible.
Keep his crate in your bedroom at night, and move his crate
to wherever you are during the day so he can be with you at
all times. And when he’s out of his crate while you’re bustling
around the house, put his leash on and bring him with you.
The next section has tips on how to teach your Beagle to
accept his collar and leash.
Investing this time with your Beagle now can jump-start a beautiful
friendship between the two of you. Take the time and make the
commitment now, and the rewards will be sweet later on. When
you’re ready to take the bonding process even further, check out
Chapter 9 for more fun activities to do with your pooch.
Getting a new leash 
(and collar) on life
When your Beagle’s not on leash, let him run around without his
collar. But when he needs to be leashed for any reason, he needs
that little nylon or leather ring around his neck.
Ideally, your Beagle will become joyful the minute he sees you pick
up his collar and leash because he’ll know that means you and he
are going for a walk. However, some Beagles — especially puppies —
may initially balk at having to be leashed or otherwise restricted.
For these freedom-loving Fidos, you’ll both have an easier time if
you slowly introduce the leash and collar. Here’s a game plan:
 Start with the collar. Buckle or snap the collar around your
dog’s neck, and then just let him react to it. Let him paw it, run
around, and otherwise demonstrate his displeasure. Keep the
collar on for a few minutes, then remove it, and try attaching it
again a little while later. Eventually, he’ll accept it. I promise.
 Let him be a drag. After your little hound accepts the collar,
attach the leash — but don’t pick up the other end. Just let him
drag the leash around until he gets used to the way it feels.
 Perform a quick pickup. When your Beagle matter-of-factly
accepts the leash and collar, pick up the other end of the
leash but don’t move. Just hold the leash for a minute or two.
 Take a hike. Once your dog is cool with you holding the other
end of the leash, try walking with him a little bit. While you
move, hold a treat within sniffing distance to encourage him,
and give him the treat if he cooperates. Pretty soon you’ll be
ready for Chapter 15 and serious walking lessons.
Chapter 7: Beginning a Beautiful Friendship 93

Visiting the Vet: The First Exam
Within a day or two of arriving home with your new dog, you need
to take him for his first visit to the veterinarian you’ve selected. 
(If you haven’t found a vet yet, please read Chapter 5 for guidelines
on finding a qualified doggy doctor.) The visit allows you and your
Beagle to get acquainted with a person who will play a key role in
keeping your dog healthy. In addition, the exam allows your vet to
learn more about your dog’s inner workings — knowledge that will
be crucial during future visits. Finally, the exam may uncover
hidden health problems plaguing your new dog, problems that you
can start solving immediately.
Bring any health records you have for your new Beagle, and, if pos-
sible, a stool sample. The records enable the vet to determine what
immunizations and other medications your dog needs, while the
stool sample can reveal the presence of parasites, such as worms.
Information on how to collect a stool sample appears in Chapter 11.
In addition to examining your Beagle’s health records and analyz-
ing the stool sample, the vet will also weigh him; measure his vital
signs; check his skin for lumps, bumps, rashes, parasites, and signs
of infection; look inside his ears for signs of parasites and infec-
tion; peer into his eyes for signs of abnormalities; check his geni-
tals for correct formation and absence of any discharge; and look
at his gums and teeth to make sure they’re healthy and properly
formed. The vet also will use a stethoscope to listen to your dog’s
heart and lungs, and will gently feel around the dog’s abdomen to
make sure everything’s as it should be.
After the vet examines your Beagle, she may give him one or more
immunizations, depending on your four-legged friend’s age and
health status. Those shots may include:
 A single shot to prevent rabies, a disease that’s deadly to both
dogs and people. Almost all state laws require that dogs and
other domestic animals be vaccinated against rabies. The 
first rabies shots are given at around 16 weeks of age; the
second shot, a booster, comes about a year later. After that,
dogs get rabies shots every one to three years, depending 
on local laws.
 A series of combination shots to prevent other serious dis-
eases, such as parvovirus, distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis,
and parainfluenza. Puppies often receive the first of these
shots, often called the DHLPP, at the age of 6 weeks, with three
subsequent shots dispensed at three-week intervals.
Part II: Starting Life with Your Beagle 
94

 A shot to prevent bordetella, also known as kennel cough, if
you plan to board your Beagle often or take him to places
where other dogs gather, such as a dog park, doggy day care,
or obedience class. Your vet also may recommend shots to
prevent Lyme disease or other illnesses, depending on where
you live and your dog’s needs.
Ask your vet whether she can give your dog each of these three
shots during separate visits. Spacing out these immunizations can
help avoid overtaxing your Beagle’s immune system.
If your dog’s stool sample reveals the presence of parasites, your
vet will also give you some medicine to rid him of all such freeload-
ers. (Chapter 12 has advice on how to get meds into your dog.)
These unwelcome minicritters include roundworms (very common
in puppies), hookworms, whipworms, coccidia, and tapeworms.
Because these little beasties can sap your dog’s energy and health,
they need to be banished. Your vet also may suggest that you give
your dog medications to combat other parasites, such as fleas and
heartworms.
Don’t buy over-the-counter deworming products. Your vet can pre-
scribe far more effective deworming products that deal specifically
with the particular wiggly critters that are bothering your Beagle.
If necessary, your vet will talk to you about arranging to have your
puppy or dog spayed or neutered. Your contract with the animal
shelter, rescue group, or breeder may require you to have this pro-
cedure performed on your four-legged friend, if it hasn’t been done
already. Most vets opt to do the surgery on puppies when they’re
about 6 months old, although some veterinarians do so earlier.
Spaying or neutering adult dogs can occur just about any time,
except when a female is in heat (a three-week period during which
she has a bloody discharge from her vagina and can mate with a
male dog). More about spaying and neutering — pro’s and con’s —
appears in Chapter 12.
Starting Daily Routines
Nothing will give your new Beagle a feeling of comfort and safety
faster than a consistent daily routine.
Divining a dining schedule
The number of meals you dispense to your four-legged friend each
day depends on his age. Young puppies generally need three meals

daily: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. After your little hound passes
the 4-month mark, though, you can cut back to two meals per day,
morning and evening.
Keep up the twice-daily meal routine throughout your Beagle’s life.
Morning and evening meals are easier on his tummy — and easier
on you. The reason: A hungry Beagle is more likely to be bored,
less likely to sleep, and if alone, more likely to vent his frustration
by eating things in your house. Chapter 8 offers tips for what to
feed and how to feed your dog.
Pacing potty breaks
The number of trips your Beagle needs to his outdoor potty
depends on his age. The baby Beagle may need to take a whiz as
often as once every hour or so, not to mention one or two bath-
room breaks during the night. Take heart: When he hits the magic
4-month mark, he’ll be able to hold his water and other stuff a little
longer. Going out before and after mealtimes, after naps, and after
strenuous play should be enough to keep him (and you) content.
And (joy!) nocturnal potty breaks should be a thing of the past.
After 6 months of age, potty breaks should occur first thing in the
morning, midday, dinnertime, and just before bedtime — a pattern
that should continue throughout the rest of your Beagle’s life.
Chapters 6 and 14 deal with teaching your Beagle where and when
to do his doo-ty.
Playing around
You can pretty much play with your pooch whenever you want,
although giving him a predictable schedule can help him adjust
faster to life in your household. For what it’s worth, I take my own
dog to a field every morning to play fetch for about 15 minutes.
This daily session helps her work off excess energy and keeps her
mellow for the rest of the day.
Your Beagle may not need to run around in a field, but a 10- to 
15-minute play session morning and evening can keep him happy
and content. Make sure, though, that those play sessions don’t
occur immediately after meals (vigorous activity could cause indi-
gestion or worse) or just before bedtime (because he’ll have a hard
time settling down to sleep).
Part II: Starting Life with Your Beagle 
96

Setting snoozing cycles
Your Snoopy-dog will probably set his own snoozing cycles, but
you can help him along a bit. Certainly he should sleep at night
when you sleep, and he’ll probably want to do some sleeping
during the day, especially during puppyhood. If you want to set
nap times for when you’re busy and can’t watch him, place him in
his crate, turn on some soft music, and watch him head to
Dreamland.
Glamming it up
Unlike other breeds, the Beagle doesn’t need a whole lot of groom-
ing. A weekly brushing, pedicure, and ear cleaning and a monthly
bath should pretty much do the trick. The lowdown on how to
beautify your Beagle appears in Chapter 10.
Socializing Your Beagle
A crucial component of helping your Beagle settle in — not to 
mention becoming and staying emotionally healthy throughout his
life — is the process of socializing him. This process means that
you do everything you can to enrich your dog’s social life. That
means not keeping him confined to the four walls of your home,
but rather getting him out and about safely.
By exposing your Beagle to new people and places, you help him
learn to deal with the unexpected with poise and confidence. The
well-socialized Beagle can handle most new situations without get-
ting bent out of shape. Visiting other people’s houses, dealing with
crowds, and welcoming visitors to his own home don’t faze him in
the least. By contrast, the unsocialized Beagle is more likely to be
fearful or even aggressive, simply because he doesn’t know how to
cope with new experiences.
Exploring the home front and beyond
If your new Beagle is a puppy, the breeder should have started
socializing him before you brought him home. However, you need
to continue the process. Here are some activities you can do with
your dog, whether he’s a puppy or adult, to help him become the
social butterfly he’s meant to be:
Chapter 7: Beginning a Beautiful Friendship 97

 Encourage exploration. Encourage your pooch to explore his
home environment — under your supervision, of course.
 Show him your stuff. Show him umbrellas, vacuum cleaners,
blow dryers, and other potential fear-inducing objects. Start
from a distance and work your way closer. Check out the
“Taming the monsters: Vacuum cleaners and blow-dryers”
section later in this chapter for more pointers on dealing with
these appliances.
 Introduce novelty. Introduce him to stairways, doorways, and
other novel structures; this chapter tells you how.
 Have some company. After you’ve had your Beagle home for
a few days, invite friendly people and their pets (make sure
the critters are vaccinated!) over to meet your new family
member.
 Go gadding about. Take your Beagle out and about. Bring him
to a school yard to watch the kids play at recess; take him to a
public area to see the goings-on. I brought my puppy to a
supermarket parking lot and sat on a bench with her. When
passersby stopped to pet her, I gave them a treat to give her.
To this day, my now-grown dog is crazy about people and
works a room like a politician.
If your Beagle puppy hasn’t had all his shots, carry him to
new places and hold him in your arms. Don’t let him walk on
surfaces where other dogs may have been; such dogs may not
have been fully immunized and could transmit communicable
diseases to your puppy. Make sure, too, that any animals that
visit you and your puppy at home are fully immunized.
 Go mobile. Take your Snoopy-dog for short, frequent car
rides to many places — not just to the vet! The “Learning to
love car rides” section in this chapter provides advice on
helping your Beagle avoid getting automotive issues, or over-
come those he may already have.
Easing a fearful adult dog 
into the big, bad world
Not every Beagle has the good fortune to be socialized during 
puppyhood — and if you have a grown-up fraidy-dog, you need to
help him catch up. Introduce him to the people, places, and experi-
ences that he should have encountered while he was a little guy.
Some tips for socializing an adult Beagle include:
Part II: Starting Life with Your Beagle 
98

 Set up a routine. Feed, potty, play with, and exercise your
hound at the same time every day, if at all possible. By doing
so, you’ll give your Beagle feelings of predictability and struc-
ture, both of which will boost his confidence.
 Let him set the pace. The undersocialized adult Beagle may
be more hesitant than a puppy to check out new people or
places. If your dog’s hesitation results in clear stress — tail
between the legs, trying to hide — stop what you’re doing
immediately. But don’t give up. Try again another day.
 Divert him. If your Beagle shows signs of stress over some-
thing you can’t immediately control, try some diversionary
tactics. For example, if he’s stressing over loud construction
noises in the next block, play with him or try some basic train-
ing to help him forget that he’s scared.
 Squelch the sweet-talk. When your Beagle cowers, trembles,
or otherwise exhibits scaredy-dog behavior, you’ll probably
want to cuddle him and sweetly tell him something like, “It’s
okaaaaay huh-neee — Mommy’s here.” Don’t give in to that
temptation. By doing so, you’re rewarding him for doing what
you don’t want him to do.
Fighting the Fear Factor
The typical Beagle is an intrepid little pooch; not much fazes him.
Still, even the most laid-back dog may find that he’s got issues that
he didn’t know about until he’s confronted with something big,
noisy, or just plain new. But your Beagle should have nothing to
worry about as long as you’re by his side. You can help him main-
tain his confidence by showing him how to deal with the unex-
pected with poise and aplomb.
Taming the monsters: Vacuum 
cleaners and blow-dryers
Cleaning dust from your house is a necessity — and when your
Beagle arrives, you’ll need to clean up Beagle hair, too (unfortu-
nately, Beagles do shed). For these and other domestic tasks, you
undoubtedly make good use of a vacuum cleaner. Your little hound
(or, for that matter, any dog), may not appreciate the vacuum
cleaner’s virtues. In fact, its loud noise and giant sucking sound
may positively spook him. He may run and hide, bark fearfully and
frantically, or show other signs of stress.
Chapter 7: Beginning a Beautiful Friendship 99

For many of us, another noisy appliance is almost as necessary as
a vacuum cleaner. The blow-dryer helps many of us tame our
tresses into highly styled coiffures that give us at least the illusion
that we are beautiful. However, your Beagle may object to the
noise emitted from this contraption. His objections may be similar
to those he registers when confronted with the vacuum cleaner.
In either case, you can take one of two approaches to help your
Beagle cope with these noisy monsters:
 Help your dog face his fear. I outline specific steps for teach-
ing your Beagle to face new or scary situations in the “Tried
and true de-spooking” sidebar that appears in this chapter.
(Make just one adjustment: Instead of speaking to him, use a
tasty treat to persuade him to deal with the situation.) The
upside to this approach is that, if successful, your Beagle will
gain confidence and be better able to cope with the unex-
pected. The downside is that you may need considerable time
to implement this approach — and, if you’re like me, you just
want to get the vacuuming done or your hair styled without
having to play therapist to your beloved Beagle.
 Accept his issues. Put your dog in his crate when you wield
either the blow-dryer or the vacuum cleaner. The advantage
here is the simplicity and ease of this approach, plus the fact
that your Beagle will quickly learn to associate his crate with
being safe. The downside is that your dog will probably
always be afraid of these two appliances — but heck, we all
have our little foibles. There’s no reason why your Beagle
shouldn’t have a few issues, as long as those issues don’t
interfere with your well-being or his.
Learning to love car rides
Some Beagles love car rides. Others, however, are less than thrilled
with automotive travel and demonstrate their displeasure by trem-
bling, howling, or even vomiting while they go mobile. You could,
of course, allow your Beagle to be a perpetual stay-at-home dog.
But his life and yours will go a lot easier if he learns to love, or at
least tolerate, being in the car. To help change your car-hating
Beagle’s mind, try some of these tips:
 Desensitize him. Get your dog used to being in the car very
gradually. Start by just sitting with him in the car for a minute
or two, then work up to several minutes. When he’s able to
tolerate sitting still in the car, try moving the car up and down
your driveway — once. Gradually work into driving up and
down your block, around the block, and through your neigh-
borhood until he’s able to tolerate being in the car.
Part II: Starting Life with Your Beagle 
100

 Make it positive. If you don’t want your Beagle to freak out at
being in the car, make sure that car trips take him to a pleas-
ant destination most of the time: a park, a puppy friend’s
house, or someplace else that’s fun. If your dog’s only car
trips are to your vet, overcoming his aversion toward the car
will be even more challenging.
 Talk to your vet. Most canine carsickness results from anxi-
ety, not motion sickness, and your vet may be able to pre-
scribe a mild sedative or other anti-anxiety medication for
your car-phobic friend.
 Go for flower power. Some owners of car-hating dogs have
found that flower essences can help ease their pooches’ fears.
Some of these essences are formulated and combined specifi-
cally to help the scaredy-dog deal with life with more equanim-
ity. An especially popular formula is Bach Flower Essences’
Rescue Remedy, which is a combination of more than a half-
dozen floral essences. More information is available at www.
bachflower.com.
Check out Chapter 13 for tips on keeping your Beagle safe in the
car, including using a doggy seat belt.
Dealing with stairways 
and doorways
Doorways and stairways are no big deal to you; you probably nego-
tiate each without even thinking about it. But for your Beagle or
any other small dog, doors and stairs may be quite another matter.
Your puppy probably has never encountered a set of steps before
and may never have had the opportunity to deal with a doorway.
He needs your assistance to help him cope with both.
To help a stair-shy Beagle deal with stairs, the one-step-at-a-time
principle is worth following:
1. Sit at the bottom of the staircase and put your little guy
on the bottom step next to you.
2. Put a treat or interesting toy on the floor and let him hop
down to reach it.
3. When he’s comfortable negotiating one step, move up
one so he needs to clamber down two.
4. Keep adding steps until he’s going down the stairs with
ease.
Chapter 7: Beginning a Beautiful Friendship 101

Your Beagle doesn’t have to learn to negotiate the entire staircase
in a single session or even a single day. Break your Stairs 101
course into several sessions if your dog gets tired or distracted.
Part II: Starting Life with Your Beagle 
102
Tried and true de-spooking
Sometimes during walks a dog gets the willies totally unexpectedly and decides to
deal with that fear in ways that aren’t convenient for you. My own dogs have gotten
spooked over seeing paper skeletons dangling from trees at Halloween (gotta love
those creative decorations); a sailboat parked on a suburban street; and a garbage
can that’s rolled onto its side and is partially blocking the sidewalk — among other
items. Their responses to these objects of fear have included running and pulling me
out into the street and into the path of an oncoming car. They’ve also plunked them-
selves down in the middle of the sidewalk and become trembling — but otherwise
immovable — objects. Either way, their methods of dealing with the unexpected
haven’t been conducive to safe, much less pleasant, excursions.
However, you can capitalize on your Beagle’s trust in you to help him face his fear
and literally get past whatever spooks him. Here’s what to do:
 Get between your dog and the object. If your Snoopy-dog suddenly stops or
changes direction, check to see what’s bothering him, and then position your-
self between him and whatever’s causing him to spook.
 Start moving slowly. Keeping yourself between your dog and the object, turn
and face him. Then, take one or two steps backward (which will be forward 
for him).
 Coax him along. In a high, happy tone of voice, coax your little guy to come
along with you. Tell him what a brave boy he is. Make sure you keep yourself
between your dog and the object.
 Check it out. If your dog responds to your entreaties, see if you can get him to
be even braver. Suggest that the two of you check out the feared object. In an
excited voice, tell him, “Hey Bowser, let’s check this out! Look at that garbage
can! Isn’t it funny looking?” If you’re close enough, pat the object and other-
wise investigate it. Chances are, your Beagle will do the same.
 Move on. If your Beagle continues to balk, don’t push the investigation; just keep
walking slowly, remaining between him and the object, and commend him for
his courage. If he does investigate, praise him lavishly, and then resume your
walk. Either way, you’re likely to see that your pooch has recovered his com-
posure quite nicely, thank you.

Until your dog has mastered the art of going down the staircase,
keep him away from stairs. For extra protection, install a baby gate
at the top of the stairs (see Chapter 5 for info on baby gates). An
unexpected tumble down a flight of stairs can seriously injure your
dog, not to mention undo all of your efforts to teach him how to
negotiate the stairs.
If your dog does take a tumble, examine him carefully. The pup
who picks himself up and goes on about his business is probably
OK, but keep a close eye on him for a day or two. However, if your
dog limps, cries when touched, or otherwise shows any sign of dis-
comfort, call your vet immediately.
Reverse the process to teach your dog to go up the stairs —
although, generally, going down stairs is more of a challenge for
most small dogs than going up.
Doorways are simply a matter of taking care. Go ahead of your
Beagle when going through doorways, and take care that a door
doesn’t slam in your little guy’s face.

aising your Beagle to be the best Snoopy-dog she
can be means giving her the best of care: feeding
her good, nutritious food; ensuring that she gets plenty
of exercise; grooming her coat, teeth, feet, ears, and other

with any and all health issues that inevitably will arise;
and planning for her care when you travel. Part III gives

B
ack when you were a kid, you probably got sick of hearing
your mother tell you to eat your peas, drink your juice, or
that you’d have no dessert until you finished everything on your
plate. Your health teacher probably irritated you just as much
when she lectured you about needing to drink four glasses of milk
every day, and then proclaimed that you are what you eat.
But you know something? They were right — and not just when
they applied their adages to you and your peers. Good nutrition is
just as important to the Beagle body as it is to the human bod.
That said, good nutrition doesn’t always mean holding your nose
and eating those veggies. And eating right certainly doesn’t pre-
clude eating for fun. This chapter not only gives you the lowdown
on what to feed your Beagle, but also tells you what you need to
know to make eating a pleasure for your little hound — and a great
training tool for you to use.
What a Dog Wants . . .
What a Dog Needs
Many a food-loving Beagle would probably love to give you her
idea of what a dog wants and needs to eat happily. Of course,
her idea of happy dining (dumpster diving, anyone?) may bear
little resemblance to her nutritional needs. That’s one reason
why your Beagle needs you. You’re the parent in this relationship,
and your knowledge of canine nutrition enables you to devise a
food regimen that’s not only good for her, but also good to eat.

“Um,” you’re saying. “I don’t know beans about canine nutrition.”
Not to worry. Here’s a primer on the nutrients that every Beagle
needs to stay in tip-top condition:
 Proteins, which enable your dog’s body to change food into
energy, come mainly from meats, vegetables, and grains.
However, all protein sources are not created equal. Most dogs,
for example, can digest a protein that comes from meat more
easily than a protein that comes from grain.
 Fats, which play a huge role in keeping a dog’s hair and skin
healthy, are found not only in foods but also in special dietary
supplements. Fats also help promote healthy digestion and
keep your Beagle’s body temperature stable.
 Vitamins and minerals, which help the dog’s body maximize
all those other nutrients, are already present in many foods.
Vitamins and minerals also keep your dog’s immune system
and coat healthy and prevent many health and behavioral
problems.
Choosing Your Beagle’s Chow
In just a few short years, the food choices available to the discrimi-
nating Beagle and her person have expanded exponentially. Just
pick up a copy of a high-end dog magazine, such as The Bark (a
great read for any dog-lover, by the way), and you’ll see a cornu-
copia of food options to buy from a store or online, not to mention
a bunch of ideas for making your dog’s food yourself. Such an abun-
dance of options can make you crazy, unless you have some basic
info on your Beagle’s possible dining choices. Without further ado,
here’s the scoop.
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
108
What about carbs?
Traditionally, experts have included carbohydrates on the list of must-have canine
nutrients — but these days, that opinion isn’t unanimous. Most carbs come from
grains, such as wheat and corn, which not only are tougher for dogs to digest than
other food sources, but also may cause allergic reactions in some dogs.
Consequently, some veterinarians and breeders now advocate keeping grains out
of a dog’s diet. Such dogs ingest relatively few carbohydrates, but that absence of
carbs doesn’t deprive them of robust health.

Store-bought and savory
The vast majority of Beagle people and other dog owners prefer to
have someone else create their dogs’ meals. Who can blame them?
Most people are so busy these days that they don’t have time to
cook their own dinners, much less their dogs’. Not to worry, though.
Pet food manufacturers have created two basic types of chow for
you to buy for your beloved Beagle.
Consuming kibble
If you’re looking for the ultimate in convenience and value, dry food
is the way to go: Just pour, serve, and count your change. Often
called kibble, dry food consists of baked pellets that are bite-sized
or smaller. They’re derived from grains, meats, and sometimes veg-
etables, with supplements such as vitamins added. In addition to its
ease of preparation, dry food generally is nutritionally complete,
which means you don’t have to feed your Beagle anything else to
keep her healthy. A Beagle whose daily fare consists of nothing but
kibble also produces poop that’s easy to scoop, and she’s likely to
have cleaner teeth than a dog that consumes softer fare. Need more
advantages? How about the fact that kibble doesn’t need refrigera-
tion and costs less than any other type of dog food.
Alas, however, no food is perfect — and for many dogs, kibble carries
a big disadvantage: It’s relatively bland. Many dogs like to have some
variety in their diets — and to such dogs, kibble may seem boringly,
depressingly the same. More than one dog in my acquaintance has
gone on a partial hunger strike after being subjected to too much
kibble for too long a time. And face it, the most economical, nutrient-
packed food is a total waste of money if your dog refuses to eat it.
Canning it
If your Beagle turns up her nose at kibble, try giving her canned
dog food. I’ll bet that as soon as you pour it into her dish and serve
it, she’ll practically fall into the dish. Dogs everywhere generally
prefer canned food to dry, because of canned food’s enticing aroma
and better taste. It’s also just as easy to fix as dry food: Just pour
and serve.
But for all that ease of preparation and great taste, canned food does
have some disadvantages. For one thing, it generally costs more
than dry food does. Moreover, because canned food contains quite
a bit of water, it delivers less nutrition than the equivalent quantity
of kibble does. Other disadvantages: It’s got more calories, and
thus is more likely to pack pounds onto your pooch; it’s too soft to
scrape tartar from your dog’s teeth; it’s much more perishable than
dry food; and it results in bigger, moister, harder-to-clean-up poop
compared to the poop a kibble-eating Beagle produces.
Chapter 8: Feeding Your Beagle 109

No one says that you have to choose between kibble and canned
when it comes to feeding your Snoopy-dog. If you want to give your
Beagle the good nutrition that comes from dry food but also the
great flavor of canned fare, give her both. For example, try giving
her a meal that’s 90 percent dry food and 10 percent canned.
Deciphering dog food labels
You can be overwhelmed by the variety of dog foods at your local
grocery or pet store. Some foods are vastly superior to others. But
the uninformed consumer may struggle to distinguish between a
truly good product and one that’s simply drowning in commercial
hype. That’s where knowing how to read a dog food label comes in
mighty handy.
Look at the list of ingredients. Are meats listed first? That means
that the food contains more meat than anything else — and that’s a
sign of good quality. Foods of lesser quality usually list grains first.
Check, too, to see what form the meat takes. If the label says “beef”
or “chicken” or “aardvark” or some other meat, you’ve got a high-
quality food. If the label lists a meat byproduct without specifying
what that byproduct is, you may be subjecting your Beagle to
eating such unsavory products as chicken beaks — not exactly a
great form of nutrition.
Look, too, for additives and preservatives, such as ethoxyquin,
BHA, and BHT. The short story here: The fewer the better.
Homemade and delicious
Are you a control freak? If so, instead of buying your Beagle’s food
off the shelf, you may want to fix her food yourself. Being your
dog’s personal chef gives you complete control over what goes
into your dog’s tummy. Such control can go a long way toward
helping you deal with any food allergies your Beagle may have or
the rare problem of a Beagle who’s a picky eater. Even better, you
could save yourself some money.
Still, the do-it-yourself option has a downside. For one thing, fixing
your dog’s meals can be inconvenient and time-consuming. The
inconvenience multiplies if you travel, whether your little hound
accompanies you or stays in a kennel.
But the biggest disadvantage to DIY-feeding is that preparing a nutri-
tionally balanced regimen for your dog is far from simple. To keep
your Beagle at her very best, you need to make sure that her food
contains the proper proportions of all the nutrients that she requires.
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
110

If you decide that the advantages of cooking your Beagle’s food out-
weigh the disadvantages, be sure to consult your veterinarian. He
can help you devise a meal plan for your Beagle that keeps her not
only healthy but happy. Consider, too, consulting a book such as
Dog Health and Nutrition For Dummies, by M. Christine Zink (Wiley).
To BARF or not to BARF?
Feeding a raw food diet
No, I’m not suggesting that you give your Beagle food that makes her
hurl — or makes you hurl, for that matter. The acronym BARF refers
to Biologically Appropriate Raw Food. Theoretically, you can concoct
such a diet yourself, but I don’t recommend doing so unless you
enjoy spending way too much time involved in a way too messy
(not to mention potentially unsanitary) enterprise. Instead, consider
buying USDA-approved raw foods made specifically for pets. No
matter how you go raw, however, this feeding method has advocates
and detractors, and both are equally passionate.
Those who favor going raw contend that a doggy menu based
entirely on uncooked meats, vegetables, and bones not only most
closely approximates what wild animals eat, but also allows dogs
to live longer, healthier lives. BARF proponents also believe that
dogs that are fed raw food have
 Cleaner teeth
 Glossier coats
 An end to food allergies
 Infection-free ears (Full disclosure here: My own dog has
enjoyed a near-total absence of ear infections since I put her
on BARF two years ago.)
Many breeders, dog show enthusiasts, and owners of performance
dogs wholeheartedly endorse the BARF diet, as do many veterinar-
ians who practice alternative veterinary medicine.
However, more traditional vets, along with pet food manufacturers,
beg to differ. Their concerns include:
 Raw bones can cause internal injuries or choking.
 Raw foods increase the odds of contracting salmonella or
other bacterial poisoning — either by the dog or by the
person handling the food.
 A diet of raw food causes some dogs to develop chronic
diarrhea or vomiting.
Chapter 8: Feeding Your Beagle 111

One formerly formidable argument against the BARF diet — that it’s
time-consuming and inconvenient to prepare — has pretty well evap-
orated. Several companies now prepare and sell raw food for dogs
and cats. Some of their offerings include exotic items, such as quail,
rabbit, and ostrich — which benefit dogs who suffer from allergies —
to more conventional proteins, such as beef and chicken. Among
these companies are Aunt Jeni’s Natural Pet Food (www.auntjeni.
com), Bravo (www.bravorawdiet.com), and Oma’s Pride (www.
omaspride.com). You won’t find their products in most stores, but
by checking their Web sites you can find distributors near you from
whom you can purchase the products. Failing that, you may be able
to get the products you want shipped directly to your door.
If you choose to feed your dog a BARF diet, know that the costs
can vary widely, depending on how much your Beagle eats, what
you feed her, and which manufacturer you patronize.
A raw diet isn’t for every dog or for every owner. If the idea of han-
dling raw food makes your stomach queasy, then bag the idea of
BARF-ing without feeling any guilt. If your dog has a compromised
immune system or a lot of chronic illnesses, a BARF diet probably
isn’t a good choice.
Before you decide to do the BARF diet with your Beagle, consult
some expert sources. A great book to start with is The Holistic Dog
Book: Canine Care for the 21st Century by Denise Flaim (Howell
Book House).
But is your chow of choice
good for her?
After you choose your Beagle’s chow, check to see whether your
choice agrees with her tummy and the rest of her body. How can
you tell whether her food is good for her? Here are some ideas:
 How does her poop look? Food that’s good for your dog is easy
for her to digest — and the clearest indication of digestibility is
small, compact stools. If your Beagle’s poop is big, bulky, soft,
and/or stinky, she may be having trouble digesting the food
you’re giving her. Try switching to another brand — but do so
gradually (see “Making the switch” later in this chapter).
 Is she getting flaky? If your Beagle’s coat is littered with
flakes, her food may be lacking vital fats. Consider switching
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
112

to a food that has a higher fat content, or ask your veterinar-
ian whether your Beagle needs a fatty acid supplement.
 Do her toots clear the room? If your Beagle’s gaseous emis-
sions are frequent and/or make you want to keel over, her
daily fare may have too many carbohydrates. A higher pro-
tein/lower carb regimen may reduce the flatulence and restore
a fresh smell to your home.
 Is she porking out? A dog food that’s loaded with calories and
fats will probably cause your little hound to lose her girlish
figure. A switch to a low-calorie food — or smaller portions of
what she’s currently eating — can help her regain her svelte
shape.
Chapter 8: Feeding Your Beagle 113
A new take on table scraps
Almost every dog care book exhorts the reader to refrain from feeding table scraps
to her dog. But anyone who’s been subjected to the guilt trip that a dog can inflict
(courtesy of those big, soulful eyes) knows that such restraint is almost impossible
to sustain. Consequently, I offer a new take on table scraps: an approach that bows
to reality.
The short version of this approach is that it’s okay to feed your dog table scraps,
within the bounds of good taste, your Beagle’s health, and simple common sense.
The long version includes these tips for healthful, guilt-free sharing of your food
with your Snoopy-dog:
 Don’t be literal. Don’t dispense table scraps directly from the table unless you
enjoy having your Beagle stare at you and your plate while you eat. (And even if
you don’t mind, other members of your family — not to mention dinner guests —
may take exception to the sight of Beagle begging.) Instead, wait until you and
your family or friends have finished eating, and then place some carefully chosen
leftovers into your dog’s dish.
 Go bland. Limit those leftovers to foods that don’t contain a lot of spices or fats,
both of which could cause your little hound to have a major digestive upset. Opt
instead for veggies, fat-free meat, fish, or white-meat portions of chicken or
turkey. And don’t feed cooked bones or gristle. Ingesting either can cause intes-
tinal obstructions or pancreatitis, both of which can make your dog really sick.
 Waste not, want not. Neither you nor your Beagle should consider the contents
of the garbage can or any other waste receptacle a food source for her. Food
from these locations quickly becomes laden with disease-causing germs and
bacteria. In other words, after the scraps leave the literal table, they should be
off the figurative table — permanently.

Making the switch
If you plan to switch your dog from one food to another, consider
doing so gradually — especially if you know she’s got a sensitive
stomach. Start by serving her three-quarters of her current food
mixed with one-quarter of the new food for a couple of days.
Assuming she tolerates the new food, move to a half-and-half mix-
ture for another few days, then one-quarter old to three-quarters
new. After that, she should be fine with the new chow.
On the other hand, many dogs do well having diets that rotate
among two to four different types of food. If your dog is one, you
don’t need to be gradual about the switches.
Getting the Skinny about Your
Hound’s Pounds
No discussion of the art and science of Beagle feeding is complete
without at least touching on how to help the Snoopy-dog who eats
too much or too little food. Keeping your Beagle svelte but not
skinny should be the balance you aim for in her feeding program.
Slimming the portly pooch
One of the many advantages to having a Beagle is that you can tell
almost immediately whether she’s packing on too many pounds.
Although other breeds such as Keeshonden or Collies can hide
their jelly bellies under mounds of fur, the Beagle has no such
cover. That means that just a quick glance or a touch can tell you
what you need to know.
Start by looking at your Beagle from above. Can you see an inden-
tation at her waistline? If so, she’s probably not overweight. If not,
try running your hands along her sides. A dog who’s at the proper
weight has ribs that you can feel easily. Too much fat, and you’ll
need to exert a little pressure to find her ribs.
If you’ve concluded that your little hound is a little too heavy,
here’s what to do:
 Ask your vet for help. Your Beagle’s veterinarian can help
you help your dog in two ways. First, he can see whether your
Beagle’s extra inches result from a health problem such as
those described in Chapter 12. Second, if he can rule out a
health problem, he can help you develop a diet and exercise
program that will help your dog slim down safely.

114

 Reduce portions. It’s simple: Dogs who weigh too much need
to eat less. Your vet can tell you how far to cut back your
Beagle’s rations. Your goal here is to help her take off weight,
but not to starve her!
 Limit treats. Reducing your Beagle’s mealtime portions will be
useless unless you also reduce the number of treats you give
her. Don’t let your little hound have a snack attack!
 Give more meals. Make those reduced rations go further by
dividing them up into three or more meals. That way, you’ll
help your dog’s tummy stay fuller for a longer period of time.
And don’t think that free feeding, or leaving large amounts
of food out for your dog to dine on as she feels like it, is an
acceptable alternative to feeding your Beagle three times a
day. See the “Free feeding forbidden” sidebar for drawbacks
on this practice.
 Add some fruits and veggies. A low-cal way to fill your dog’s
tummy is to add some fruits and vegetables to her regular
fare. Good stuff to try includes apples, carrots, frozen green
beans, frozen Brussels sprouts, and frozen broccoli. Be careful
not to feed too many of these items, though, or you’ll find that
your dog will need to poop more often.
Cut any fruits and vegetables into very small pieces or, better
yet, run them through the blender so your Beagle can eat and
digest them more easily.
 Get her moving. Exercise is as important for your Beagle as it
is for you. Your dog’s small size makes it easy for you to give
her extra exercise opportunities without tiring her out or
taking too much of your own time. A couple of extra walks or
longer-distance strolls can burn up extra calories; so can
swimming. More info on great exercises and activities for
Beagles is in Chapter 9.
Picky, picky, picky
Some dogs just aren’t that into food, or so it seems. These dogs may
simply not like the atmosphere in which they’re eating; for these
environmentally conscious individuals, the next section, “Attending
to Ambiance,” can help. However, other apparently picky eaters may
object not to how they’re eating but what they’re eating. To help
your fussy Fidette learn to enjoy her food, try these suggestions:
 Add something special. A diet that’s all kibble all the time
may be nutritious, but for some dogs it’s also way too bland.
Back in my less-enlightened dog-owning days, my dog went on
a hunger strike after enduring an exclusively kibble diet for
way too long. Adding canned dog food or nutritious table
Chapter 8: Feeding Your Beagle 115

scraps — or even just pouring some warm water on the kibble
to create a rich gravy — can lure your bored Beagle gourmand
back to her dish.
 Make a change. Another way to combat gastronomic bore-
dom is to change the food your Beagle’s been eating. Look for
something that’s a little more flavorful than what you’ve been
giving her, and gradually switch her from one food to another
over several days.
 Add some variety. Some experts advise Beagle owners and
other dog owners to refrain from varying their dogs’ menus.
They contend that consistency keeps a dog healthy. However,
consistency may also result in a dog who’s less than thrilled
at mealtime. In my many years as an enthusiastic dog owner,
and almost as many as a student of all things canine, I’ve con-
cluded that many dogs enjoy variety in their meals, just like
we do. Consequently, I rotate three or four different meats in
my dog’s fare. You can do the same — and give your sweetie
something to look forward to at mealtime.
The suggestions here apply only to those Beagles whose pickiness
is habitual and long-standing. If your usually ravenous Beagle sud-
denly loses interest in food for more than a meal or so, she could
be seriously ill. Call your veterinarian as soon as possible.
Attending to Ambience
Do you like to eat your dinner at the table with music playing in
the background, or on a TV tray while you watch the evening
news? Do you like to have quiet while you eat, or does music
improve the atmosphere? Is Sunday not quite right unless you
have breakfast in bed? The answers to these questions add up to
your special dining preferences and underscore the fact that good
eating isn’t just a matter of what you eat, but how you eat it.
The same principle holds true for your Beagle. Just like you, she
may have definite dining preferences. If you make an effort to
determine those preferences, your dog is likely to eat better, feel
better, and behave better.
For example, some dogs prefer to eat alone, while others like to
have the rest of their family around them. Some prefer to eat in one
place, while others have such a strong need to be where the family
is that you need to bring the dog’s dish to wherever the action is.
In any case, catering to these preferences won’t spoil your Beagle.
Instead, your thoughtfulness will help her eat more regularly (and
thus, eliminate more regularly) and cut down on digestive troubles
that unnecessary stress can trigger.
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
116

But while every dog, Beagle or otherwise, is unique, certain eating
principles apply to every member of the canine race. Those princi-
ples include
 Letting her eat in peace: When your dog is scarfing down her
rations, don’t interrupt her — and don’t let anyone else do so,
either. That includes not only human family members, but
also animal family members, such as cats and other dogs.
 Forestalling food fights: If your Beagle is one of several ani-
mals in your family menagerie, feed each nonhuman member
separately — either in different locations at the same time or at
Chapter 8: Feeding Your Beagle 117
Free feeding forbidden
The idea of leaving food out for your Snoopy-dog 24/7 may seem like a great idea —
or, at the very least, a practice that would be really convenient for you. And if your
dog is like most Beagles, she’d probably like nothing better than to have food at the
ready instead of having to wait for you to feed her. But this is one case where the con-
venience for you and desirability for your Beagle of leaving food out all the time — a
practice that experts call free feeding — don’t offset the downsides of this practice.
Here’s why:
 Free feeding = housetraining hassles. As Chapter 14 explains, a basic principle
of teaching your Beagle basic bathroom manners is understanding that what
goes into your dog eventually comes out. If you know when your Beagle’s been
scarfing down food at one end of her body, you have a better chance of fore-
casting when that food will reappear at the other end. Such predictability helps
you anticipate when your housetrainee needs a bathroom break, and you can
get her outside before she has an accident. By contrast, free feeding makes it
impossible for you to figure out when and how much your dog has eaten, which
makes forecasting her need for pit stops equally problematic.
 Free feeding = weaker bond. If your Beagle sees food in her dish all the time,
she’s likely to forget who’s providing that food: you. Banning free feeding and
turning daily meals into a twice-daily ritual reminds your dog that you are the
source of all good things in her life. That understanding makes her likely to want
to please you, which will strengthen your relationship with her.
 Free feeding = lost clue. Still not convinced? Here’s another, potentially serious
downside to free feeding: the loss of a vital indicator of your dog’s health status.
The symptoms of many canine illnesses — including serious ailments, such as
cancer — include a lack of appetite. If you feed your Beagle twice a day, you’ll
see any changes in food intake immediately, and get her the help she needs
right away. By contrast, keeping your Beagle’s bowl filled all the time may mask
this vital sign of health and wellness, unless you’re keeping track of how often
you’re filling the dish.

the same location but at different times. Such forethought will
prevent the battles over food that almost always result when
you attempt to feed all pets at the same time in the same place.
 Not rushing her meal: Good food is an even bigger pleasure
for dogs than it is for people — for dogs, breakfast and dinner
are among the high points of their day. So don’t be in a rush to
pick up her dish; give your Beagle sufficient time — at least 15
minutes — to savor her daily fare. By doing so, you’ll reduce
her chances of getting an upset stomach.
 Doing the dishes: Washing your dog’s dishes not only consti-
tutes good hygiene, but also enhances your dog’s meal. In
fact, many dogs refuse to eat food from a dirty dish. Can you
blame them? Do for your Beagle what you would do for your-
self: Give her clean dishes to dine from.
Treating Your Beagle Right
Should treats be part of your Beagle’s diet? Absolutely. As you see
throughout Part IV, treats make a terrific tool for teaching your
Beagle how to be a well-mannered Snoopy-dog. The prospect of
scoring a tasty morsel can spur almost any dog — including the
occasionally stubborn Beagle — into figuring out what you want
her to do and then doing it.
But dispensing treats isn’t a risk-free proposition. Unless you’re
careful, the treats that are great for your Beagle’s brain may end up
being not-so-good for the rest of her body. In other words, too
many treats can make for a Beagle with too many pounds. At the
same time, though, a low-cal treat will get you and your Beagle
nowhere if she decides she doesn’t like what you’re offering.
Selecting scrumptious snacks
A good treat is a goody that your Beagle absolutely adores — so
much so that she will do anything, just anything, to earn one of
those tasty (and often smelly) morsels. At the same time, though,
the treat shouldn’t be so fattening that your Beagle will pork out.
Here are some suggestions for treats that many dogs adore:
 Fish-based treats, such as those available from high-end dog
product Web sites, such as SitStay.com (www.sitstay.com).
 Fruits and veggies, such as tiny pieces of carrot, apple, and
frozen vegetables.
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
118

 Meaty treats that you cook to reduce the fat content. Small
hot dog pieces microwaved to a crisp smell like bacon — a
heavenly smell to a Beagle. Those goodies will contain a lot
less fat if you wrap them in a paper towel before you feed
them to your dog. The paper towel will absorb much of the fat.
 Semi-moist dog foods, such as those that come in a tube, can
make wonderful treats. They smell delicious to your Beagle,
and that great smell can be a wonderful incentive for her to
learn what you’re trying to teach her. These foods are full of
calories, though, so feed in moderation — and scale back your
Beagle’s regular fare.
 Commercial dog biscuits and treats are OK — if you feed
them in moderation and if they don’t contain artificial colors
or dyes. Those colors may catch your eye, but they do noth-
ing good for your dog’s health and well-being.
Keeping calories under control
Treats can work wonders to boost your Beagle’s mental prowess —
but all the calories in those little morsels also can cause her to
pack on the pounds.
To make sure that your Beagle has the incentive to learn without
losing her sleek physique, start by downsizing her mealtimes. If
you’re feeding commercial treats, check the manufacturer’s label to
see how many ounces a certain number of treats is equivalent to —
and downsize your dog’s meals accordingly. For homemade treats,
try cutting meals by 10 to 20 percent during the initial training
phases, when you’re dispensing a lot of goodies to teach good
behavior.
After your Beagle’s learned a new trick, command, or other maneu-
ver, start cutting back on the number of treats you give her for
obeying your command. Instead of rewarding her every time she
complies, start rewarding her every other time, then every third
time, and so on. Eventually, she should be satisfied with some
lavish praise and petting as a reward for a job well done.
Avoiding Dangerous Dining
Alas, your Beagle doesn’t necessarily have a clear sense of what’s
good and what’s not so good for her to eat. She needs you, her
knowledgeable human, to keep her away from those foods that
could make her seriously ill, not to mention very uncomfortable.
Here’s a sampling of food items that you need to keep your Beagle
away from if you want to keep her healthy:
Chapter 8: Feeding Your Beagle 119

 Cooked bones: The big rib from that roast may smell wonder-
ful to your Beagle, but the effect on her digestive tract could
be decidedly unwonderful. Cooked bones splinter easily,
which could result in small pieces of bone getting stuck any-
where in the digestive tract.
 Onions and garlic: We humans like these flavorful root veg-
gies to flavor our foods, but they can be poisonous to our
canine companions if used in raw form. Make sure that your
Beagle doesn’t get any! Garlic powder is okay, though.
 Grapes: Another food that your Beagle needs to avoid; too
many grapes are toxic to all breeds of dogs.
 Chocolate: I once lived with a dog who would have done
anything to get a taste of mint chocolate liqueur, and most
canines adore the scent of chocolate. But here, too, the siren
smell of a food meant for humans is toxic to members of the
canine race. Don’t let your Beagle anywhere near your
Godivas — or any other brand.
Your Beagle’s Drinking Habits
Water is vital to all living things, including Beagles. And just like
people, Snoopy-dogs need more water after they’ve been running
around than after a nap, and more during the hot days (notice I
didn’t say “dog days”) of summer than the frigid days of winter.
Moreover, individual dogs’ cravings for water vary; for example,
dogs who eat nothing but dry food will probably pay more visits
to their water bowls than those who eat canned or other types
of food.
Adult Beagles should have access to fresh water all day. Keep your
little hound’s water dish full, but don’t just top it off when the
water level gets low. Instead, empty the dish and give her some
fresh water. Another time to change the water is when you see
food residue or other stuff floating in it. And even if the dish con-
tains nothing but water, you should wash the bowl every day.
Beagle puppies, as well as adults who haven’t quite mastered the
art of proper potty deportment should get plenty of water, but they
shouldn’t have unlimited access. Chapter 14 includes guidelines
for giving water to the dog who’s still learning her basic bathroom
manners.
And do make sure that your Beagle drinks only the water in her
dish. Pond water, water in the toilet, and swimming pool water
contain substances that could upset her tummy.

Exercising Your Beagle
In This Chapter
 Understanding how exercise benefits your Beagle (and you)

F
or most of my life, I was an intermittent exerciser. Workouts
weren’t part of my thinking, much less my schedule. Every
time I read an article by some buff expert extolling the benefits of
exercising for at least 30 minutes three times a week, I’d mutter to
myself, “Yeah, and who’s got the time? Not me.”
Then I went on a cruise to the Caribbean, and to rid myself of the
guilt that I felt after I ate way too much delicious food, I headed to
the ship’s gym to put in some time on the treadmill and exercise
machines. To my considerable surprise, I enjoyed myself — and
to my supreme relief, my clothes still fit me at the end of the
cruise. Those results sold me, and when I returned to dry land,
I joined a nearby gym. Today, my clothes still fit me, I’ve toned
up, and I deal with stress a heck of a lot better than I did before
I joined the gym.
The same benefits that we get from exercise our dogs also get, if
we take the time to make sure they get their daily workouts. This
chapter explains how exercise not only benefits your Beagle, but
also you. In addition, I list a bunch of sports that can keep your
Beagle trim and toned well into his golden years, not to mention
mentally sharp and much better behaved than might otherwise be
the case.

Keep Him Moving, Keep
Yourself Happy
Dog trainers constantly tell their human clients that a tired dog is a
happy dog — and for good reason. The pooch who has had the
chance to flex his muscles and use his brainpower is generally too
pooped to get into mischief such as unwinding toilet paper, pilfer-
ing laundry, and engaging in other activities that don’t please his
people. Put another way, a dog who stays out of mischief results in
a happy dog owner — and that generally leads full circle to a
happy dog.
Plus, getting and staying in shape feels just as good to your Beagle
as it does to you. Regular exercise not only prevents the boredom
that gets him into hot water with you — it also does wonderful
things for his body and overall health. The Beagle who stays in
shape has a healthier heart and lungs, less fat on his body, greater
mobility, and fewer aches and pains than his couch-potato counter-
part. Those health advantages will become increasingly important
to your Beagle as he ages.
Finally, exercise gives your Beagle a chance to be with the individ-
ual who matters (or should matter) more to him than anyone else:
you. That’s because Snoopy-dogs are social creatures, and they’re
not likely to exert themselves to any great extent unless their
people are there to do it with them. They need their people not
only to show them the moves that will keep them in shape, but
also just to keep them company.
And isn’t your Beagle’s company the reason that you added him to
your life in the first place? He’s a delightful little guy, and having
the chance to do stuff with him gives you opportunities to enjoy
him for the unique individual that he is. Helping your Beagle stay
in shape keeps your relationship with him in shape, too. Doing so
need not take a whole lot of time: A couple of brisk 15- to 20-minute
walks per day may be all he needs. Of course, your Beagle may be
such wonderful company that you may need and want a whole lot
more time with him than that!
Trying Everyday Exercises
You don’t have to join a doggy gym or invest in fancy equipment to
give your Beagle a good workout. The stuff you do every day can,
with a little tweaking, become part of great exercise routine for any
dog. Here are some ideas.
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
122

Walk on the wild side
In all likelihood, you’ll be walking your Beagle anyway, simply to
take him to his outdoor potty. But why not go beyond the thrice-
daily bathroom break, and go for a stroll with your little guy?
And if you’re a couch potato by nature, take heart. A leisurely stroll
for you can be a brisk walk for a Beagle, whose little legs have to
move at a quick pace to keep up with your relatively long-limbed
strides. A 20-minute walk around a couple of blocks gets your
Beagle buddy moving and gives the two of you some quality time
together. And a daily stroll is especially good for a senior dog,
because walking provides gentle exercise that’s kind to an older
pooch’s joints, muscles, and ligaments.
Chapter 15 explains how to teach your dog to walk politely when
he’s on a leash. When you and he are out and about, though, keep
the following safety precautions in mind:
 Keep it cool. Black-topped pavement heated to furnace-level
temperatures by the summer sun is very unkind to a Beagle’s
tender paw pads. Avoid walking on such surfaces during the
summer so your dog’s feet don’t burn.
 Avoid extremes. If the weather’s too hot or too cold for you
to take a long hike, the same is true for your Beagle. Keep
the walks short during summer heat waves and winter 
deep-freezes.
 Heed your dog. If your Beagle limps, lags, or otherwise can’t
keep up with you, stop to rest, or at least slow your pace.
If your normally energetic Beagle suddenly can’t keep up with
you during walks, have your veterinarian check him out. A
sudden loss of energy may signal the onset of a serious illness.
 Use the leash. The Beagle’s reputation for wandering off in
whatever direction his nose takes him means that you must —
absolutely must — keep him on the leash unless you’re in an
area that’s enclosed by a secure fence.
Jog your memory (or at least
your feet)
For the relatively fit Beagle, a jog with his favorite person can
prove even more beneficial than a walk. The aerobic benefits multi-
ply, and the Beagle expends considerably more calories than he
does when walking. Jogging also tires out your little hound faster
Chapter 9: Getting Physical: Exercising Your Beagle 123

than a walk does, which could prove helpful if he must spend time
on his own later. (A Beagle who’s had a good jog will be too tired to
get into any mischief!) Jogging also delivers many benefits to your
body — but that’s a subject for another book.
The same guidelines for walking apply to jogging with two additions.
 If your dog shows any signs of discomfort (such as limping),
don’t jog him at all.
 Try not to jog on concrete — for the sake of his knees and
yours. Instead, opt for a softer surface such as a jogging trail,
bike trail shoulder, or even grass if it’s not slippery.
Get in the swim
Doggy-style swimming is one of the best exercises your Beagle can
engage in. A dip in a pond or pool gives your dog’s joints, liga-
ments, and muscles a terrific workout without causing the strain
that weight-bearing exercises such as walking and jogging may
entail — a benefit that’s especially helpful for dogs who are over-
weight, arthritic, or recovering from surgery or injury.
Your local pond or nearby creek can serve as a puppy pool. You
can also find an honest-to-goodness heated pool (but probably not
your local public pool) for your Beagle to execute his water ballet
moves in: Just log onto any Internet search engine and type dog
hydrotherapy and United States. You’ll come up with plenty of
results. (Some places require referral from a veterinarian.)
But no matter where you take your Beagle to swim, make sure that
the experience is positive for him. Swimming is great for any dog,
including a Beagle — but some dogs take longer than others to
appreciate this activity. If your Snoopy-dog is a skittish swimmer,
give him time to get used to the pool or pond. Have him wear a
doggy life jacket to help him stay afloat, and throw floatable treats
such as oyster crackers into the pool to give him a reason to start
paddling. In a pond or creek, go in ahead of him, and use a treat or
toy to coax him to come to you and into the water.
Great Sports for You
and Your Beagle
Wanna go beyond everyday athletics with your Beagle? This sec-
tion’s for you. Here are descriptions of all kinds of doggy sports
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
124

and other activities that you and your little hound might enjoy par-
ticipating in together.
Goin’ to the show
The oldest and best known of the organized dog sports is the dog
show, which is known more formally as conformation. That formal
term makes a great deal of sense, because dog shows measure how
well each dog conforms to the standard of his breed — that blue-
print for a perfect Beagle or other dog breed that I describe in
Chapter 2.
Does your dog have what it takes to excel in the show ring? Maybe
yes, maybe no. If you’re a dog-show novice, take your Beagle to a
reputable breeder and have her evaluate him. She can examine
your little hound and tell you how he stacks up against the Beagle
breed standard. Attend a few local dog shows, too, and get a feel-
ing for how they work. (Flip to the color section to see Beagles par-
ticipating in a dog show.)
If you’ve already spayed or neutered your Beagle, forget about
showing him. The American Kennel Club, which sponsors many
dog shows, does not permit the exhibition of a dog who has been
snipped.
If your Beagle does have the stuff — and if you haven’t neutered
him yet (or spayed your female) — you can read up on the dog-
show world. Two books to start with are Dog Showing for Beginners
by Lynn Hall (Howell Book House) and The Absolute Beginner’s
Guide to Showing Your Dog by Cheryl S. Smith (Three Rivers Press).
The resources section at the end of this book lists magazines that
can help you pilot your Beagle’s show-dog career, or just decide
whether you want to start it in the first place.
Stay the (agility) course
Does your Beagle like to race around the house, jump atop the
couch, or burrow underneath it? Can he turn corners on a dime
while barely slowing down? Then your dog may be a fine candidate
for the increasingly popular, exciting canine sport of agility.
In agility, a human handler directs her dog through an obstacle
course that consists of tunnels (under-the-couch burrowers should
find these a cinch to navigate), teeter-totters, hurdles, weave
poles, A-frames, and balance beams. Almost any breed can learn
this sport, but you may find it tough to teach your dog yourself.
Not to worry, though. Plenty of professional dog trainers hold
Chapter 9: Getting Physical: Exercising Your Beagle 125

classes in beginning agility. (To get an idea of an obstacle your
Beagle may encounter on an agility course, check out the photo in
the color section.) And if you plan on competing your dog, plan on
getting yourself in shape, too. At the competition level, agility is
strenuous exercise for both dog and handler.
You can also supplement your class work with reading. If you think
you may want to enter your Beagle in agility competitions, check
out All About Agility by Jacqueline O’Neil (Howell Book House). If,
however, you think you just want your Beagle to do agility for
kicks, browse through Having Fun with Agility by Margaret H.
Bonham (Howell Book House). You can get even more info about
agility from the American Kennel Club (www.akc.org); the North
American Dog Agility Council (www.nadac.com); and the United
States Dog Agility Association (www.usdaa.com).
Fetch that flyball
If your Beagle wants to get in touch with his inner Retriever, you
and he may want to take up flyball, a sport that’s as exciting and
fast-paced as agility.
Flyball is a relay race that requires each dog on a team to run to a
box-shaped ball launcher. The dog presses his paw on a lever that
activates a spring inside the box and releases the ball. After the
dog catches the ball, he races over hurdles back to the starting
point. The next dog in line starts the cycle all over again. The
fastest team wins the competition.
The North American Flyball Association sponsors flyball competi-
tions, and its Web site is www.flyball.org. Here you can find gen-
eral information about the sport. If you’re looking for more specific
info, such as where to find a flyball class, log onto the Flyball Home
Page at www.flyballdogs.com. There you can find a comprehen-
sive, searchable database of teams from all over the United States —
including, in all likelihood, a team that trains in your area. Many of
these teams offer classes for prospective flyball pooches and their
people.
Opt for obedience
Obedience is exactly what it sounds like: an activity that tests a
dog’s ability to obey commands amid numerous distractions (for
example, a bunch of other dogs and people nearby).
In obedience trials, a judge scores a dog for each command the dog
performs. If a dog earns at least 150 out of a possible 200 points in a
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
126

single match, he earns a leg toward an obedience title. Three legs
brings an obedience title. Earn more legs, and the dog earns still
more titles, up to the ultimate accolades: Obedience Trial
Champion and National Obedience Champion (earned by one dog
each year at the AKC National Obedience Invitational).
Not surprisingly, Beagles don’t dominate most lists of top obedi-
ence dogs. The independent, easily distracted Snoopy-dog may
have more trouble than other breeds when he tries to execute
commands precisely or perform mistake-free maneuvers. But so
what? Winning isn’t everything. No matter where your Beagle
places, obedience can certainly help build the bond between the
two of you, and can keep your dog sharp as a tack. Info about the
world of competitive obedience is available from the American

Rally-ho!
Some people — and probably, their Beagles, too — consider the
world of competitive obedience to be incredibly dull. They find the
precisely scripted exercises to be too difficult and too yawn-induc-
ing to be any fun. At the same time, though, they find agility too
strenuous, particularly if the dog is older or the person doesn’t
have the energy to run all over the agility course alongside the
dog. They’d love to find a sport that’s more interesting than obedi-
ence but less active than agility.
That sport has arrived, and it’s called rally obedience. In this sport,
a dog and handler complete a course of 10 to 20 stations that’s
been designed by the rally judge. At each station, a sign tells the
team what the dog needs to do there. For example, your Beagle
may perform a Sit or walk a figure 8 around the sign. The judge
scores the team on how well it performs the maneuvers.
Rally obedience is a great activity for a Beagle and his person.
Although the Beagle’s independence and distractibility can make
this sport more of a challenge for him than for other breeds, he
can still do well. In fact, three Beagles accumulated national rank-
ing points during 2005, the most recent year that such information
was available when this book was written.
Two organizations — the American Kennel Club and the
Association of Pet Dog Trainers — sponsor rally obedience compe-
titions and titles. Information about the AKC Rally program is avail-
able at the AKC Web site at www.akc.org/events/rally. To find

Obedience program, log onto www.apdt.com/po/rally.

Dance with me: Canine freestyle
Are you musically inclined? Do you like to trip the light fantastic? Is
dancing your idea of heaven? Well, surprisingly, you can dance
with a four-footed partner — your Beagle — in the relatively new
sport of canine freestyle. In canine freestyle, you and your Beagle
perform maneuvers that are set to music. Your dog might circle
around you, spin, or perform a flip in response to your signals and
in time to the music.
After you and your dog take some classes in canine freestyle and
determine whether this sport is for the two of you, check out the
info offered by two groups that promote this rhythmic pursuit. The
World Canine Freestyle Organization (WCFO) was founded by Patie
Ventre, a dog lover who once was a competitive ballroom dancer.
The WCFO Web site is www.worldcaninefreestyle.org. The
other group is the Canine Freestyle Federation Inc. This group’s
Web site includes a list of nationwide organizations that hold
canine freestyle classes. Find out more by logging onto www.

Join the hunt: Field trials
The Beagle’s original reason for being was to hunt rabbits and
other small animals — and today’s dog still has the stuff needed to
do just that. And although you may not need your little hound to
help you hunt your own food, you can still give him a chance to tap
into his deepest instincts by introducing him to field trials.
The American Kennel Club has devised field trials for almost every
type of hunting dog or hound dog. For example, Golden Retrievers,
Labrador Retrievers, and other retriever breeds can participate in
events that test their ability to bring water fowl back to their han-
dlers under various conditions. Other breeds, such as the
Dachshund, the Basset Hound, as well as all Spaniels and Pointers,
have similar opportunities to get back in touch with their roots.
Field trials for Beagles measure the dogs’ abilities to track and trail
rabbits and other small game. These events have many forms:
 Brace: Determines the hunting ability of a pair of Beagles
 Small pack: Measures the talent of a group of as many as nine
Beagles
 Large pack: Rates the performance of between 30 and 60 dogs
 Gun dog brace: Ascertains how a pair of dogs reacts to the
sound of gunfire
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
128

Field trials for Beagles are classified by height and gender.
Thirteen-inch Beagles run only with other 13-inch Beagles; the
same is true with 15-inchers. Dogs also are separated by sex — no
co-ed field trials for Snoopy-dogs! Female dogs in heat may not par-
ticipate (just think of how distracted all those male dogs would
be!). Spayed or neutered dogs may not participate, either, because
field trials, like conformation (see the “Goin’ to the Show” section
in this chapter), aim to showcase the best breeding stock.
The event starts with the flushing out of a rabbit. When a rabbit is
sighted, the cry “Tallyho!” is sounded. The dogs are expected to
pick up the scent of the rabbit and bark, at which point they’re let
off leash to track the bunny. Judges assess each participant’s track-
ing ability, determination, and intensity. Certain mistakes, such as
going the wrong way and quitting altogether, result in a dog’s elimi-
nation from its pack until a winner eventually emerges.
More info on Beagle field trials is available from the American
Kennel Club at www.akc.org/events/field_trials/beagles.
Another place to find out more is at the American Rabbit Hound
Association, which you can find on the World Wide Web at www.
arha.com.
Get on the right track
Although Beagles were built to hunt rabbits and hares, their
incredibly sensitive noses allow them to find just about anything.
To harness this ability without involving those sweet little bunnies,
Beagle owners may find competing in tracking events to be a
worthwhile pursuit. Unlike field trials, tracking events are open to
all breeds. The objective is to measure a dog’s ability to recognize
and follow a human scent until the person is found.
The American Kennel Club offers three tracking titles:
 Tracking Dog (TD): For following a track of up to 440 to 500
yards with several turns
 Tracking Dog Excellent (TDX): For following an older track of
up to 1,000 yards with more turns
 Variable Surface Tracking (VST): For tracking a scent for up
to 800 yards over at least three different surfaces
A dog who earns all three titles is awarded the title of Champion
Tracker (CT). More information about tracking is available from
the American Kennel Club at www.akc.org/events/tracking.
Chapter 9: Getting Physical: Exercising Your Beagle 129

Adjusting for Age
Exercise is as good for senior Beagles as it is for their younger
counterparts, but that doesn’t mean that they should conduct
their workouts the same way that youthful hounds do. Older dogs
are more likely to have special health issues that can limit their
endurance or their ability to engage in certain activities. And even
senior Snoopy-dogs who don’t have specific health issues need to
adjust their physical activities to fit the limitations that aging may
impose. Here are some ways to do just that:
 Go softer. If you and your Beagle have always jogged on side-
walks or streets, move to softer terrain that will be easier on
his hips and joints. Grass is good as long as it’s not wet (and
slippery); so are roadside or trailside shoulders.
 Limber up. A warm-up (such as a slow walk before beginning
to jog) will help keep your senior dog from getting injured or
overworking his muscles and joints.
 Have water at the ready. Your Beagle needs water to prevent
dehydration. Bring some along with you.
 Work out regularly. Regular exercise is the key to minimizing
your senior fitness fanatic’s pain and strain. Plan to work out
with him at least three to four times every week.
 Adjust for the weather. An older dog feels warmth or cold
more keenly than a young one does, so don’t exercise your
senior when the weather is either very hot or very cold.
 Watch your Beagle. Let your dog tell you when he’s had
enough exercise for now. If he’s lagging behind, slowing his
pace, and panting heavily, it’s time for him to quit.
Lots more information on living with and loving an older Beagle
appears in Chapter 12.

In This Chapter
 Grooming for good health and a better relationship
 Brushing for a healthy coat

 Giving your Beagle a bath
 Tending to ears, eyes, feet, and bottom
 Cleaning your Beagle’s teeth
 Dealing with winter-time concerns
M
any people choose to share their lives with Beagles because
the Snoopy-dog is a relatively low-maintenance canine, at
least when it comes to grooming. Those who don’t want to pay for
a Poodle’s monthly trip to a groomer or sit down each day to
remove the mats from a Golden Retriever’s coat undoubtedly
appreciate the Beagle’s no-fuss, no-muss coiffure.
But just because the Beagle has a wash-and-wear hairdo doesn’t
mean that she doesn’t need regular grooming. Not only does she
need grooming to stay clean and healthy, she also needs grooming
to have one-on-one time with you. In addition, regular grooming pro-
vides a great opportunity to examine your little hound for lumps,
bumps, cuts, and other signs that she’s not in tip-top condition.
This chapter gives you the basic info you need to keep your Beagle
well groomed from the end of her nose to the tip of her tail — and
everywhere in between.
Giving Her the Brush-off
A thorough brushing once or twice a week is crucial to keep your
Beagle’s coat and skin healthy. The brushing action gently stimu-
lates the skin and distributes the skin’s natural oils throughout the
coat. Brushing also helps to control your Beagle’s shedding — or,

at least, to reduce the amount of hair that would otherwise get into
your carpets, furniture, or clothes.
You only need one tool to brush your pup: a brush! The best ones
have soft bristles; alternatively, you can use a curry comb.
Easy brushing goes like this:
1. Start by getting yourself and your Beagle into comfort-
able positions.
A safe way to brush your dog is to have her lie down —
Chapter 15 explains how to teach her to lie down on
command — and roll over onto her side, as shown in
Figure 10-1.
Unless you have a professional grooming station with the
means to secure your dog safely, don’t place her on a
raised surface such as a table. She could be at risk for
injury if she decides to end the brushing session prema-
turely and jump down.
2. After she’s lying down and relaxed, gently stroke her
entire body in the direction of the hair growth with the
soft-bristle brush or curry comb.
3. After you’re done with the first side, gently roll her over
and do the other side.
Piece of cake!
It’s hard to imagine that any Snoopy-dog could hate being brushed,
but if yours is one of those rare individuals, help is at hand. If
yours is a hard-to-brush hound, try employing one or both of the
following tactics:
 Turn on the TV. No, I’m not kidding. Put on your favorite trashy
television show (meaning one that doesn’t require much of
your attention) and invite your Beagle to snuggle up with you.
When she does, pet her gently and help her relax. Then, when
you see that she’s headed toward Dreamland, get out the brush
and try a few gentle strokes. If she objects, stop the session
immediately but try again later. If she doesn’t object, tell her in
a soothing voice what a good girl she is and continue brushing.
 Bribe her. Any time you and your Beagle are having a love-
fest (also known as a petting party), give her a treat. Then, as
she’s nibbling the treat, wield the brush for a stroke or two. If
she doesn’t object, give her another treat and praise her for
being a good girl. Gradually build up the number of brush
strokes you give her. Pretty soon, she’ll adore being brushed.
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
132

Figure 10-1: Placing your Beagle on her side can make 
brushing easier.
Establishing a No-Critter Zone
They’re teeny-tiny, almost microscopically small — but they can
make your Beagle’s life (and yours!) miserable. I’m talking about
the fleas and ticks that hitchhike their way to happiness on the
body of your hound and countless other canines.
Fighting those fleas
Just one flea can drive your dog to distraction. A single bite will
cause your four-legged friend to get itchy. Worse, if she’s allergic to
the fleas, she may scratch so much that she’ll lose part of her coat,
cause her skin to bleed, and open the door to all kinds of tough-to-
treat infections. Even if she’s not allergic, without relief from fleas
your dog may become anemic, because the flea’s dinner of choice
is canine blood. However, the flea is an equal opportunity parasite;
it has no problem jumping from your Beagle to you. When it does,
you’ll be scratching, too.
Chapter 10: Sprucing Up Your Beagle 133

And of course, the flea is not a solitary critter. If you find one flea
bite on your dog, you can be sure that a multitude of fleas has been
feasting on her.
Hunting for fleas
How do you know if your Beagle has fleas? If she begins scratching
almost constantly, take a look at her tummy. Many black specks on
the skin of her stomach and/or groin may signal the presence of
flea dirt — the blood the flea expels after it’s dined on your dog.
Moisten any suspected flea dirt with water. If the specks turn red,
your Beagle’s got fleas.
You may even see a tiny little critter or two scampering on your
dog’s skin. Still not sure? Take a flea comb and run it through your
Beagle’s coat. If she’s got fleas, you’ll see them crawling around the
teeth of the comb. (A flea comb is a small comb with very fine
teeth that are very close together. Its single purpose is to help you
deal with fleas on your dog.)
Zapping the little buggers
Fortunately, you can give your Beagle permanent relief from fleas.
In recent years, pharmaceutical companies have unveiled a variety
of products that successfully eradicate these useless parasites.
Some stop the flea’s eggs from developing, thus causing the popu-
lation to die off because it can’t reproduce. Others kill the adult
fleas that make the mistake of biting the treated dog.
Even better are the many flea-control products that are masters of
multitasking. For example, the chewable pill that stops flea eggs
from developing also kills parasites such as heartworm (which can
be fatal if untreated), hookworm, roundworm, and whipworm. A
topical product that zaps adult fleas does the same to ticks. Both
are available only with a veterinarian’s prescription — which leads
me to strongly suggest that you consult your veterinarian before
starting any flea control program. For one thing, your vet can steer
you away from outdated — and frankly, not terribly effective —
remedies, such as flea collars, shampoos, and dips.
Banishing those ticks
Ticks are a real danger to canine and human health. They transmit
serious diseases such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spot-
ted fever. Antibiotics can zap these diseases, but experts agree that
prevention is the better strategy to dealing with these maladies.
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
134

Prevention starts with checking your dog often to see if she has
any ticks on her body and removing them properly. Depending on
the type of tick and how much it’s feasted on your Beagle, it will
look like a bump that’s anywhere from the size of a pinhead to a
pencil eraser and be dark brown to brownish-grey in color.
You’ll need a pair of rubber gloves, tweezers, a needle, rubbing
alcohol, cotton balls, a bowl, doggy shampoo, and water.
To remove a tick, have your dog sit or lie down. Then:
1. Put on the gloves and grab the tweezers.
2. Grab the tick’s body with the tweezers, and pull it
straight off the dog.
Don’t twist or jerk while you pull. That way, you’re more
likely to get the whole tick, not just the headless body.
3. Check to make sure you got the head as well as the body.
If the tick’s head appears to have been left behind, remove
it from the dog’s skin with a needle that’s been dipped in
rubbing alcohol.
4. Put the tick in a bowl of alcohol to kill it.
5. Clean the area from which you pulled the tick with a
cotton ball that has a tiny amount of shampoo on it. Rinse
with water and dry. Then use another cotton ball to place
a dab of rubbing alcohol on the site.
6. Watch for signs of tick-borne disease.
Those signs include appetite loss, weight loss, fever,
lethargy, and stiffness. Such symptoms probably will
appear four to ten days after you’ve removed the tick,
although they may take longer to show up. No matter when
your Beagle shows such signs of trouble, though, take her
to your veterinarian.
Lather Up! Bathing Your Beagle
Every Beagle needs to be bathed periodically — but unlike you,
your Snoopy-dog doesn’t need a daily sudsing, or even a weekly
one. A monthly bath should keep her clean and sweet smelling, but
if she happens to get really dirty between regularly scheduled
baths, an extra turn in the tub is fine.
Chapter 10: Sprucing Up Your Beagle 135

From dirty dog to washed dog
Luckily for you, a Beagle is relatively small and easy to bathe. But
before you put your Beagle in the tub, gather the gear you need:
 Shampoo made just for dogs
 A hand-held shower attachment or bowl for rinsing
 Cotton balls to protect the ears from water
 A rubber bathmat to keep her from her from slipping in the tub
 A couple of big, fluffy towels
Don’t forget about yourself! If you’re bathing your dog in a bathtub,
place a couple of towels on the floor to cushion your knees. And
wear something impervious to water: a waterproof apron or even a
swimsuit. (Yes, you will get wet. Maybe very wet.)
After you gather these goods, do two more things:
 Protect her ears. For dogs, water in the ear is very uncomfort-
able. To keep water out of the ears, place a cotton ball in each.
 Dilute the shampoo. Add three or four units of water to every
unit of shampoo you plan to use. That way, the shampoo will
lather and rinse more easily.
Now you’re ready to get bubbly! Follow these steps to safely bathe
your Beagle:
1. Lay the bathmat in the tub to keep your Beagle’s feet
steady.
2. Carefully lift her into the tub.
Keep a steady hand. If your Beagle hasn’t yet learned to
appreciate the joys of bath time, keep a hand on her while
she’s in the tub so she can’t hop out easily. And in the
unlikely event that she does make a break from the tub,
keep the bathroom door closed so she doesn’t go racing all
over your home before you’ve finished.
3. With a hand-held shower attachment or a small bowl,
pour warm (never hot!) water over your dog, making
sure the water goes all the way down to the skin.
Start at the top of the head and neck, and then wet the
length of the backbone. After that, water her sides, chest,
legs, and tail.
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
136

4. Apply enough diluted shampoo to create lather all over
the dog’s body.
Don’t OD on the suds. Billowy clouds or multiple floating
bubbles mean you’ve laid the lather on way too thick.
5. When your Beagle’s in a full-body lather, use the shower
attachment or bowl to rinse her off.
Perform the rinse in the same order you performed the ini-
tial wet-down: front to back, top to bottom.
Make sure you get every last bit of soap off your Beagle; an
incomplete rinse will leave her skin flaky, dry, and itchy.
Keep pouring on the water for five minutes or until the
rinse water runs clear — whichever comes last.
6. Block the tub and let her shake.
With your Beagle still in the tub, hold a bath towel up in
front of you so it’s between you and your dog. At this point,
she’ll shake the excess water off her coat — but thanks to
the towel, that excess water won’t get on you.
7. Gently lift your Beagle out of the tub and wrap her in a
dry towel to speed up the drying process.
Don’t rub, though; instead, blot the excess water from the
coat and skin.
8. Let your dog indulge in an after-bath running frenzy —
after which you can towel her some more.
Beagles have short hair and small bodies, so you don’t
need to bother with a hair dryer.
And . . . that’s a wrap! You’re done (except for cleaning up the mess
in the bathroom, of course)!
Defusing the Beagle stink bomb
Sometimes your little hound may, well, stink. She may smell bad
because she’s rolled around in something disgusting, such as a
dead animal. That’s normal doggy behavior — but if your dog
engages in such behavior, her next stop should be the bathtub.
At other times, an ear infection or gum disease may be causing her
icky odor. Both conditions can be cleared up with medication, reg-
ular cleaning, and possibly, a change in diet. Your vet can help you
relieve both conditions.
Chapter 10: Sprucing Up Your Beagle 137

If, however, your normally sweet-smelling Snoopy-dog suddenly
sports a foul odor that you can’t attribute to any single cause, take
her to your vet. A sudden change in odor may signal the onset of a
serious condition.
Bottom line: Don’t assume your Beagle’s BO is normal doggy odor.
Chances are it’s not.
Tending to Eyes and Ears
A Beagle’s eyes and ears need special care, but you need not be a
visual or audio specialist to provide the basics.
Cleaning the windows to the soul
Keeping your Beagle’s eyes clean is a snap and really only needs to
be done whenever you see any little eye crumbs at the inner cor-
ners. Just like with you, these crumbs are most likely to appear
after she’s had a nap — and after a nap may be the best time to
remove them.
The only equipment you need is a bit of cotton or small cloth. To
tidy up your little friend’s eyes:
1. Have your dog sit in front of you.
2. Gently wipe the inner corners of her eyes with the cotton
or cloth.
If you see any goopy, colored discharge from the eye, a red or
inflamed eye, cloudiness of the eye, sensitivity to light, or if your
dog frequently paws at her eye, take her to a veterinarian as soon
as possible. She may have a serious vision problem, and prompt
treatment is essential.
Wiping out the ears
A Beagle’s ears need more attention than the eyes do. That’s
because the little hound’s long, floppy ears provide a perfect
breeding ground for fungi and bacterial infections. The ear flap
(that’s the floppy part) covers the rest of the ear and restricts air
flow in and out of it. The result: a perpetually moist ear and lots of
potential for ear trouble.
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
138

Weekly cleaning can keep the ears dry and help them stay infection
free. To do the job right, you need some cotton balls and an ear
cleaner made especially for dogs.
Ear cleaners are available from your veterinarian, but you can also
make your own by combining two parts water with one part white
vinegar in a squirt bottle.
After you’ve secured your Beagle’s ear gear, follow these steps:
1. Have your dog either sit or lie down.
2. Squirt a little bit of cleaner into the ear.
If your dog doesn’t like to have cleaner squirted directly
into her ear, saturate the cotton ball with ear cleaner. Then,
place the cotton ball in the dog’s ear (but not too far into
the canal). Squeeze the cotton ball so the cleaner flows
from the cotton ball into the ear canal.
3. Fold the flap over the ear and massage the base of the ear
for about one minute. Let your Beagle shake her head.
4. Use your cotton ball to clean the visible parts of the ear,
as shown in Figure 10-2.
Figure 10-2: Regular cleaning keeps your Beagle’s ears healthy.
Chapter 10: Sprucing Up Your Beagle 139

If your Beagle shakes her head a lot, runs her ears along the
ground often, paws at her ears, or has a dark, goopy discharge, she
probably has an ear infection. The same is true if your dog’s ears
smell like baking bread. Take her to the vet. Ear infections are not a
trivial matter. They’re very painful to your Snoopy-dog — and if left
untreated can result in permanent hearing loss.
Brushing Those Pearlies
When your Beagle yawns, do you want to give her a breath mint? If
so, your dog isn’t alone. According to the American Veterinary
Dental College, more than 80 percent of all dogs and cats show
signs of dental disease by the age of 3 — and bad breath is a sure
sign that dental disease is present (see Chapter 12). This condition
not only makes your Beagle not so nice to be near, but also could
lead to tooth loss and even bacterial infections in other parts of
the body.
However, all those problems are preventable. All you have to do is
brush your Beagle’s teeth once daily, or at least three or four times
a week. Brushing removes the food particles and other crud that
coats the teeth with plaque and creates a breeding ground for
dental disease.
Before you tackle your Beagle’s teeth, you need to have these
items on hand:
 A soft toothbrush that’s designed for either pets or children
 Toothpaste created especially for dogs
Don’t use human toothpaste; it can upset your Beagle’s stom-
ach. Besides, doggy toothpaste — which comes in flavors like
chicken and beef — will taste much better to your Beagle.
Here’s how to do the job:
1. Put enough toothpaste on the toothbrush to cover half to
two-thirds of the brush. Have your dog sit in front of you.
2. Lift your dog’s lips and gently brush the outer surfaces of
her teeth. Figure 10-3 shows how to pull back the lip.
Brush vertically, from one side of the mouth to the other;
one pass ought to do it. (Your dog probably won’t tolerate
any more brushing than that!) Don’t worry about the inner
surfaces; your Beagle’s tongue keeps those areas clean.
And unlike when we brush our teeth, your Beagle won’t need
to rinse or have a towel nearby for dainty mouth wipes.
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
140

If your four-legged friend has never used a toothbrush
before, get a finger brush from your local pet supply store,
or just wrap some gauze around your finger. Rub her gums
gently with the gauze or finger brush until she’s used to
having you work with her mouth. Then, gradually introduce
her to the toothbrush.
3. Bribe your Beagle with a short walk or play with her for
a few minutes after each session with the toothbrush.
A Beagle who can expect something nice to happen right
after a brushing is much more likely to put up with the pro-
cedure than one who’s got nothing to look forward to.
4. Brush at the same time every day.
Having a schedule helps you to remember to brush daily. An
added bonus: If your Beagle expects her brushing at a par-
ticular time, she may be more amenable to the procedure.
Alas, some dogs simply don’t tolerate having their teeth brushed. If
your dog is one of them, try giving her special plaque-reducing
foods and plaque-fighting treats.
Figure 10-3: Brush your dog’s teeth daily to keep her healthy all over.
Chapter 10: Sprucing Up Your Beagle 141

Trimming the Tootsies
If you saw a Beagle clunking down the street wearing the latest pair
of Manolo Blahnik high heels, you’d probably think she looked
pretty silly, right? And you’d probably shudder over the strain the
poor dog would be putting on her feet and legs.
Well, if you let your Beagle’s toenails grow too long, your Snoopy-
dog suffers the same way she would if she had her own pair of
Manolos — and she doesn’t look nearly as good. Overgrown toe-
nails throw your Beagle off balance and can cause her to suffer any
number of painful injuries. Regular nail trimmings, however, can
prevent such mishaps and keep your Beagle on her right (and left)
feet.
The nails should be short enough to be off the ground when she’s
standing still, and her dew claws (the nails that are found higher
up on the leg near the ankle) should be trimmed short enough to
prevent them from curving back into the skin of the leg.
You only need a few things to give your dog a pedicure:
 A pair of nail clippers designed just for dogs
 Styptic powder (available in pharmacies) or baking flour in
case you cut the quick
 Lots of yummy treats (at least 20 of them!)
Here’s how to trim her toenails and help your Beagle put her best
foot forward:
1. Have your dog either sit or lie down.
She should be relaxed, and you should be able to reach
her paws.
TV time can be a good time to give your dog a nail trim.
That’s because many dogs relax when they watch the tube
with their people.
2. Look for the quick, the blood vessel inside the toenail
that runs almost to the end of the nail.
Light nails make the quick easy to see; it’s the pink area
inside the nail. With dark nails, you can’t see the quick,
so you have to guess where it is.
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
142

3. Pick up one of your Beagle’s paws, and gently squeeze it
to extend the nails a bit. Place the clippers around the
very end of one nail, as Figure 10-4 shows. Squeeze the
clippers quickly to trim off the nail tip.
4. Continue trimming a little at a time until you see the
black dot in the center of the trimmed nail.
The black dot is where the quick starts.
5. Stay calm and apply some styptic powder or baking flour
to the nail if you cut the quick.
If you accidentally trim the nail too short and hit the quick,
the nail will bleed — a lot. Don’t panic. The bleeding will
stop very quickly after you apply styptic powder or flour.
6. Give your Beagle a treat each time you finish trimming
a nail.
Keep rewarding her, one nail at a time. Many dogs decide
that pedicures are tolerable if they get a few treats during
the process.
Figure 10-4: Be careful to avoid cutting the quick when you 
trim the nail.

Addressing Your Beagle’s
Bottom Line
No question about it: A Beagle’s bottom is cute. One look at that
wiggly tush (the wiggles come from that perpetually wagging tail)
and you’ll be hooked — if the Snoopy-dog’s big soulful eyes haven’t
won your heart already.
But at times, the Beagle’s bottom may turn into a real pain in the
you-know-what for her. You may see her rub her derrière along the
ground after she poops, or perhaps her rear end is sporting a very
strong and totally unpleasant odor. Either of these conditions may
indicate a common but painful problem: full anal sacs.
Every Beagle has two of these little sacs, one on each side of her
anus (also known as the rectum, the opening through which the
dog poops). Normally when a dog poops, the sacs release a little
bit of incredibly strong-smelling fluid that helps the dog mark terri-
tory and leave her calling card. In other words, the fluid identifies
the deposit that your Beagle leaves after a bowel movement as
her deposit.
Sometimes, though, the glands around the anus produce more fluid
than the sacs are capable of holding, or the small openings in the
sacs become clogged with fluid. That’s when your Beagle may start
dragging her butt along the ground — a behavior that experts call
scooting — and you notice a very strong-smelling odor emanating
from her tush.
The way to stop the scooting, eliminate the odor, and relieve your
Beagle’s discomfort is to release — or, in veterinarian-speak,
express — the excess fluid from the anal sacs. Any veterinarian and
most professional groomers are happy to do this literally stinky
and certainly unappealing job for you for a nominal charge. But if
you want to do the job yourself, you can.
You will definitely want to have some latex gloves and plenty of tis-
sues for this procedure. After the worst is over, you’ll also need
some petroleum jelly.
Here’s what to do:
1. Take your Beagle to an area such as the bathroom or any-
place else where the floor can be cleaned easily.
2. Put on some latex gloves.

3. Lift your dog’s tail with one hand, and with the other pick
up some tissues.
4. With the tissued hand, feel around the anus for the anal
sacs, which are located at approximately the four o’clock
and eight o’clock positions with respect to the anus (see
Figure 10-5).
If they’re full, you’ll feel two little bumps at those positions.
5. Cover the anus with tissues (trust me, you do not want to
skip this step!).
6. With your fingers on the anal sacs (remember four
o’clock and eight o’clock), gently press inward.
If your fingers are placed correctly, you’ll feel the sacs
begin to empty, and you’ll see fluid on the tissues that
cover the anus. If nothing happens, try repositioning your
fingers until you feel the sacs begin to empty.
7. Continue until no more fluid emerges onto the tissues.
8. Apply a little bit of petroleum jelly to the anus and sur-
rounding area to soothe them.

your Beagle’s anal sacs.

Winterizing Your Beagle
Keeping your Beagle happy and healthy and comfortable in all sea-
sons isn’t hard to do. The Snoopy-dog is a hardy soul, and a few
adjustments are all that’s needed to keep her in tip-top condition
all year round, especially during the winter.
The winter-time Beagle may experience the same cold-weather
phenomena as the winter-time human: dry, flaky skin. But while
human beings can slather on moisturizers and lotions to combat
the dryness, your Beagle’s dry skin may need treatment from
within. Make sure your dog gets plenty of water, and talk with your
veterinarian about adding fatty acid supplements to her diet.
We humans have lots of shoes and boots with which to cover our
feet during the winter, but dogs generally have the dubious pleas-
ure of walking barefoot over snow and ice. Be considerate of your
Beagle. If she’s running outside in the snow, make sure you remove
any snow or ice that’s accumulated between her toes after she gets
inside. Leaving those little ice balls intact can spread your Beagle’s
toes in a most uncomfortable fashion.
During the winter, your considerate neighbors may sprinkle rock
salt on their sidewalks to make them less slippery. But while that
salt helps keep you upright, it causes your Beagle’s sensitive paw
pads to dry out and burn. When you and your pooch walk outside
during snow season, try to avoid walking her over salted surfaces.
If you can’t avoid those surfaces, thoroughly rinse your Beagle’s
feet with warm water when you come back inside.
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
146
Bundling up Beagle
Does your Beagle need a sweater to keep her toasty warm during the winter?
Probably not, but that doesn’t mean she wouldn’t appreciate a little help staying
warm during those cold winter walks. Pet stores and upscale pet clothing catalogs
abound with sweaters and coats to protect Beagles and other canine snow-bunnies
(how’s that for a contradiction in terms?) from the ravages of Old Man Winter.
How do you know which size is right for your Beagle? First, stretch a tape measure
from the base of her neck to the base of her tail. This is her top line measurement.
Then, measure her chest by wrapping the tape measure around her trunk at the
widest point, just behind her front legs. Those two measurements can help you
determine your Beagle’s clothing size. Generally, Beagles wear a medium — but as
with so many other issues, your mileage may vary.

aintaining your Beagle’s health means much more than
schlepping him to the vet for periodic shots and when he
feels sick. You, not your vet, are your dog’s primary health-care
provider, and you can do a lot right from your own home to keep
your little hound in tip-top condition.
That said, you certainly need not (and should not) go it alone
when taking care of your Beagle. Your veterinarian is ready to be
your partner in your ongoing effort to maintain your dog’s health.
This chapter outlines what you need to know and do — both on
your own and with your vet’s help — to keep your Beagle healthy
and happy.
Working with Your Vet
Your friendly veterinarian plays an important role in keeping you
on track in your efforts to keep your Beagle healthy. He’s got the
professional training to be the perfect partner for you, the loving
owner. His knowledge of overall canine health, coupled with your
knowledge of your own, very individual Snoopy-dog, give your dog
the best possible odds for living a healthy, happy life.

The wellness exam
Just as you need regular checkups from your doctor, so too does
your dog. Most experts suggest bringing your Beagle in for a well-
ness exam once a year until he turns 8 or 9 years old. At that point,
you can consider him to be a senior citizen, and he should see his
vet for wellness exams twice a year instead of just once.
But just what is a wellness exam? Simple: It’s a checkup that a
doctor or veterinarian gives the patient when that patient is
believed to be free of illness. The exam provides a baseline against
which to measure future changes in health status.
During a complete wellness exam, your vet will
 Measure your dog’s vital signs, such as weight, temperature,
pulse, and respiration
 Look into your dog’s ears and eyes to see if there’s any redness,
discharge, odor, or any other signs of ear and eye disease
 Run his hands over your Beagle’s bod to determine if he’s got
any lumps, bumps, or tender areas
 Check the heart, lungs, joints, feet, and “private areas”
 Peer at your Beagle’s teeth and gums to see if any redness,
puffiness, or plaque is present
 Check his skin to see if it’s flaky, has a rash, or shows anything
else that’s out of the ordinary
Depending on how your vet clinic does things, your vet also may
 Ask you to bring in a stool and/or urine sample so he can
check for intestinal parasites, nutritional problems, and/or
urinary tract infections.
 Give your dog some shots or other immunizations. But then
again, he may not. The next section explains why.
To immunize or not to immunize?
Not so long ago, there was only one answer to the above question:
Yes, you should immunize your dog, and you should do it every
year. And there’s no question that immunizations have done our
dogs a world of good. They’ve saved many Beagles and other
dogs from contracting dreaded diseases such as rabies, distemper,
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
148

parvovirus, and hepatitis. They can also prevent less serious but
nevertheless unpleasant conditions such as bordetella, which is
also known as kennel cough. Chapter 7 describes the shots your
Beagle probably will get the first time he visits your vet.
In recent years, however, many experts have begun to question
whether yearly immunizations are necessary or even beneficial.
These experts believe that immunizations can protect dogs from
disease for much longer than a year. After all, do we get shots
every year? Not by a long shot (and yes, that pun was fully
intended).
Chapter 11:Managing Your Beagle’s Day-to-Day Health 149
Collecting free samples
If your vet needs a stool or urine sample, he can get them himself, but he’ll charge
you a fee to do so. Better for you, your Beagle, and your wallet to bring the samples
yourself. And you can do it, without making a mess. Here’s how.
To collect a stool sample:
1. Grab a plastic bag (such as a grocery bag or the bag your daily newspaper
comes in) and take your Snoopy-dog out for a walk.
2. When he takes a dump, turn the bag inside out and pull it over your arm.
3. Use the hand covered by the bag to pick up the poop. Then, with your other
hand, pull the bag inside out.
The poop will now be inside the bag.
4. Knot the open end, and take the poop to your vet as soon as possible.
To collect a urine sample:
1. Get a plastic bag and a clean plastic container such as the kind that margarine
comes in.
2. Pull the bag over your arm, and hold the container with your bag-covered hand.
3. Take your little hound out for a walk and watch to see when he’s about to pee.
4. As soon as he squats, slip the container under his tush to collect the urine that
will stream out immediately thereafter. You don’t need much; a teaspoon
at most.
If some of the urine splashes on your arm, no big deal — you’ve got it covered!
5. Seal the container, and take the sample to your veterinarian as soon as
you can.

In addition, many vets and knowledgeable owners have become
concerned that yearly immunizations actually may endanger some
dogs. Among the possible problems they cite:
 Tumors: The possibility is remote, but nevertheless real, that
the dog could develop a tumor at the immunization site.
 Negative effects on the immune system: Frequent shots may
catapult a dog’s immune system into warp drive, which could
trigger the onset of chronic, potentially serious autoimmune
diseases, such as lupus.

Conventional or alternative medicine?
Not so long ago, veterinarians in the United States pretty much all took the same
approach to treating their patients: They viewed disease as an enemy to be van-
quished. The usual battle plan embodied two approaches: stopping the disease
before it started or conquering the disease once it occurred. The result has been —
and continues to be — a vast array of preventive treatments for dreaded diseases
such as parvovirus, rabies, and distemper, and an equally large variety of medicines,
surgical techniques, and similar remedies to rid the body of disease that’s already
taken hold. This approach is known as conventional veterinary medicine or Western
veterinary medicine.
But in recent years, another approach to animal health care has gained ground.
This approach, known as alternative veterinary medicine, complementary veteri-
nary medicine, or Eastern veterinary medicine, focuses on maximizing the body’s
own defenses against illness. This approach to medicine uses therapies and treat-
ments, such as acupuncture and chiropractic, that may be unfamiliar to conven-
tional practitioners. And because this approach emphasizes treating the whole
animal, not just the disease, it’s sometimes known as holistic veterinary medicine.
So which approach is better for your Beagle?
The answer is both. The best veterinary medicine combines each of these
approaches. For example, a Beagle with allergies may need the immunizations
developed under the conventional approach, but may also benefit from a change
in diet, which often is advocated by alternative veterinary medical practitioners. A
good veterinarian will use both approaches in her practice — or, if she can’t, refer
you to someone who can offer the other approach if hers isn’t working.
You can find out more about both approaches by checking out some Web sites such
as that of the American Veterinary Medical Association (www.avma.org) and the
American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association (www.ahvma.org). The latter
site also contains a searchable database that enables you to find a veterinarian
who specializes in holistic medicine in your state — either as the primary practi-
tioner whom you consult or someone who works with you and your regular vet to
maintain your Beagle’s health.

For those reasons, some veterinarians suggest yearly tests for anti-
bodies to specific diseases to determine whether immunizations to
prevent those diseases are necessary. Others, however, believe
that these tests, which are called titers, aren’t yet accurate enough
to be relied upon. Many vets compromise between the old and 
new theories and recommend giving shots every three years
instead of annually. In fact, the American Animal Hospital
Association (AAHA) recommends that after 1 year of age, dogs
receive their core (essential) vaccinations — against rabies, 
parvovirus, and distemper — every three years. For dogs who
spend a lot of time with other dogs, an annual bordetella shot is
recommended.
Should your Beagle have babies?
If you’re concerned that your female Beagle will worry about her
biological clock if she doesn’t have puppies . . . or that your male
Beagle will feel like less of a guy if he doesn’t have a sex life . . .
think again. Your Snoopy-dog’s life can be happy and fulfilling even
if that life does not include sex or babies — I mean, puppies.
Or maybe you thought that by breeding your female Beagle you
could show your kids the miracle of birth? Yes, maybe you could.
But you’ll have an awful lot of hard work to do after that birth
occurs: taking care of several puppies ‘round the clock, and then
finding good homes for them. If you’re like most parents, you
barely have time to help your kids with their homework. Do you
really think you’re going to be able to take care of a litter of pup-
pies? I thought not.
Show dogs get to skip surgery
There’s really only one reason to refrain from spaying or neutering
your Beagle, and that’s if you plan to enter her or him into confor-
mation dog shows. The American Kennel Club (AKC), which is the
primary U.S. honcho for such shows, does not allow spayed or
neutered dogs of any breed to compete. The reason behind that
prohibition is based on history: Dog shows were developed in the
late 19th century to showcase breeding stock to potential buyers.
That thinking still applies to some extent today.
If you think you’d like to show your Beagle, though, get an expert’s
opinion before you begin to venture down that road. The reputable
breeder from whom you bought your Beagle can tell you whether
she thinks your dog has what it takes to become a breed cham-
pion. And get a book that tells you what you need to know to get
started in breeding. A good book to begin with is Breeding Dogs
For Dummies by Richard G. Beauchamp (Wiley).
Chapter 11:Managing Your Beagle’s Day-to-Day Health 151

Chances are, if the contract from your breeder contains a manda-
tory spay or neuter provision, she doesn’t think your little hound
is dog show material. Most breeders evaluate their puppies at a
very young age. They identify show prospects at that time and
structure the purchase contracts for those puppies accordingly.

152
Ready, aim, specialize!
If you had a heart condition and needed a triple bypass, your regular family physi-
cian almost certainly would not be the person to perform the procedure. Instead,
he’d probably refer you to a doctor who specializes in performing surgery on hearts:
a cardiac surgeon. Similarly, if you became pregnant, your regular doctor probably
would send you to a physician who specializes in prenatal care and the delivery of
babies: a obstetrician/gynecologist.
The same is becoming true of veterinary medicine. If your Beagle develops a seri-
ous eye problem, your regular vet can refer you to an eye specialist: a veterinary
ophthalmologist. If he develops a mysterious rash that doesn’t respond to treatment,
your vet would probably refer you to a veterinary dermatologist. The world of human
medicine has become populated with highly skilled specialists — and so, too, has
veterinary medicine.
A national professional organization for vets who work in the United States, the
American Veterinary Medical Association, maintains a listing of 20 specialty organi-
zations. Some of those groups, such as the American College of Zoological Medicine,
probably don’t include vets who would treat your Snoopy-dog. But specialized vet-
erinarians who would treat your canine companion are likely to be a member of the
group that represents their field, such as the American Veterinary Dental College, the
American College of Veterinary Dermatology, and the American College of Veterinary
Ophthalmology. You can find the most current list by logging onto the World Wide Web
at www.avma.org/education/abvs/vetspecialists.asp.
Members of each specialty group are veterinarians who have completed post-grad-
uate work in their subjects. They have to pass challenging exams that test their
knowledge in their specialties. If they pass, their specialty organization certifies
them as being qualified to specialize in their particular field of veterinary medicine.
When you hear that a veterinarian is board-certified, you know that the specialist
brings a ton of knowledge to the work he does with his animal patients.
Some of these specialists work together to create a large referral center. For exam-
ple, about two miles away from my home is the Southpaws Veterinary Referral
Center. This facility houses specialists in emergency care, holistic internal medi-
cine, neurology, oncology, radiology, surgery, and orthopedics. Other specialists
work from schools of veterinary medicine attached to large universities. To find a
referral center in your area, type “veterinary referral center” into an Internet search
engine, such as Google or Yahoo.

The good news about spaying, neutering
If your Beagle isn’t a show prospect, there’s really no sense in
holding off on spaying (the canine equivalent of a hysterectomy,
in which the dog’s uterus and ovaries are removed) or neutering
(the removal of a dog’s testicles). In fact, by “fixing” your Fido or
Fidette, you may well prolong your dog’s life. A neutered male can’t
acquire testicular cancer, which is a fairly common scourge among
doggy guys. A spayed female won’t ever suffer from pyometra, a
potentially serious uterine infection. And if you have her spayed
before her first heat cycle, she’s much less likely to develop breast
cancer, which is one of the most common diseases suffered by
intact female dogs.
Not convinced? Consider this: The neutered or spayed Beagle proba-
bly will behave much better than he or she would otherwise. The
male Beagle will have much less of a need to mark his territory with
a shot of dog pee across the bow or onto your furniture. He won’t
get nearly as upset as he otherwise would if he were to catch the
scent of a female dog in heat and is much less likely to take off for
parts unknown in search of that female. That greatly lessens his
chances of getting lost or struck by a car. As for your female, she —
and you — won’t ever have to deal with the mess and inconvenience
of coming into heat: a twice-a-year, one- or two-week episode that
involves keeping her off the rugs and keeping her in doggy diapers
to spare your furnishings from the bloody discharge that occurs.
Some veterinarians spay or neuter puppies as early as 7 weeks of
age, but many others suggest waiting until the dog is 6 months old
or so, when a pup may be better able to tolerate being anes-
thetized. In any case, you need not wait until your female Beagle
comes into heat for the first time, which is usually around 6 to 9
months of age. The surgery will probably involve an overnight stay,
and your Snoopy-dog will be sore for a few days as the incision
heals — but that’s all. And neither a boy Beagle nor a girl Beagle
will miss having a sex life. Promise!
Can I See Your ID?
No, no, no — I’m not discussing how to keep underage Snoopy-dogs
from bellying up to the local bar and scoring illegal drinks. Beagles
need several kinds of identification for other reasons: to enable
them to get back home if they become lost (which is way too easy
for a wandering Beagle to do), and to comply with state and local
ordinances. Read on to see which forms of ID do which — and see
which one you might consider not bothering with.
Chapter 11:Managing Your Beagle’s Day-to-Day Health 153

Playing tag(s)
Every Beagle needs to have at least two tags hanging from his
collar: a tag that certifies he’s been inoculated against rabies and a
tag that tells people who he is. Depending on where you live, he
may also need a third tag: a dog license.
Rabies tag
Your veterinarian will give you a rabies tag after he has inoculated
your Beagle against the dreaded and always fatal disease of rabies.
The tag certifies that your dog has been immunized against the dis-
ease (see Figure 11-1). Your dog needs to have this tag on his collar
at all times, especially if the two of you are traveling outside your
home state. That way, if your dog is injured or becomes ill while
you travel, the veterinarian who takes care of him will know that
he is protected against rabies and that she doesn’t need to give
him another rabies shot as a precautionary measure.
Figure 11-1: A rabies tag indicates that 
your Beagle is current on his rabies
immunization.
Identification tag
An identification tag is the quickest way that a person can deter-
mine who your dog is and where he lives (see Figure 11-2). You can
create these little gizmos on the spot at any local pet superstore,
and the cost will be minimal. If, however, you go for fancier fare,
you can order a larger, more attractive tag from an upscale pet
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
154

retailer. For example, Planet Dog (www.planetdog.com) offers a
round, silver-plated disk with your dog’s name and address on one
side and the company logo on the other.
Make sure your dog’s tag includes at least his name, address, and a
phone number where you can be reached.
Dog license
Many municipalities and towns require that your dog acquire still
another tag: a dog license. Having a license entitles your dog to use
canine facilities, such as a dog park — although you’ll see plenty of
people bring their dogs to such facilities without anyone checking
to see if the animal has a license. Still, if your beloved but unli-
censed Beagle gets loose, you may have to pay a fine to your com-
munity for having an unlicensed animal. You make the call.
Tattoo you
Until the use of microchips (discussed in the next section) became
widespread as a form of identification, tattoos were the backup ID
of choice for dogs. After a number is tattooed on the inside of a
dog’s hind leg, the number is entered into a national registry, such
as the National Dog Registry (www.nationaldogregistry.com) or
AKC Companion Animal Recovery (www.akccar.org). A person
who finds a dog can call a veterinarian, the police, or animal con-
trol, any of whom know to look for a tattoo and contact the reg-
istry. Voilà! Your dog is then on his way home.
Figure 11-2: An identification tag gives the who and where information 
for your little hound.
Chapter 11:Managing Your Beagle’s Day-to-Day Health 155

A chip in the old (or not-so-old)
Beagle
In recent years, microchips have become more popular than tat-
toos (refer to the previous section) as a form of permanent identifi-
cation for dogs. A veterinarian can easily insert one of these chips
under the skin between your Beagle’s shoulder blades; the chip is
just a little bit larger in diameter than a pencil lead.
At the same time your Beagle gets his microchip, you get a form that
registers him with the registry that’s administering the microchip,
such as the AKC Companion Animal Recovery Program. Just as with
the tattoo, animal pros know how to scan your dog (using a special
scanning device) to see if a microchip is present. The scanning
device activates a unique identification code. The person who per-
forms the scan then calls the appropriate registry, where a recovery
specialist has all of the information needed to get your Beagle safely
back to you. The registry also will give you a tag that contains your
Beagle’s microchip number and the registry’s telephone number.
However, microchipping is all for naught unless you complete the
registration form and send it to the company that administers the
chip. And if you move, contact the registry and tell them your new
address. Make sure, too, that you register with a large microchip
company, such as Home Again or AVID, both of which manufacture
chips that are more easily scanned.
Have your vet insert your Beagle’s microchip when she or he is
being spayed or neutered. That way, you don’t have to make a sep-
arate trip to the vet to have the job done.
Do not rely solely on an identification tag to help your lost Beagle
find his way home. A dog can lose his collar all too easily; my own
dog has done so twice — so far. A permanent form of identification
such as a tattoo or microchip can reunite you with your lost dog
even if he loses his collar.
Maintaining Good Health at Home
Your veterinarian is the best person to know how to treat your
Beagle when he gets sick or injured. But you are the best person to
know when all’s right with your canine companion, and to keep
him that way between visits to the vet.
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
156

Knowing what’s normal
You can’t know if anything’s wrong with your Beagle unless you
know how he looks and acts when everything’s fine. That’s why it’s
important to spend time grooming and otherwise caring for your
little hound and observing how he behaves when he’s free from
illness.
Make it a point to note how much your Beagle usually eats during
one sitting. That way, you’ll know immediately when your dog’s
appetite is off. A lack of interest in food that lasts for more than a
couple of meals can be a sign of serious trouble and warrants a call
to your veterinarian.
Another behavioral clue to note is how much water your Beagle
drinks when all is well. See how often, generally speaking, you need
to fill his water bowl — once a day, twice a day, whatever. If you
observe a sudden increase in his water intake for no obvious
reason (such as being hot, thirsty from exercise, or thirsty from
enjoying a chew toy), your vet needs to have a look at him.
Take note, too, of how often your Beagle does his business, and
what that business looks like. Such knowledge will help you spot
signs of difficulty quickly. For example, if your Beagle suddenly
starts peeing more often than normal, he may have a urinary tract
infection — an uncomfortable condition that requires treatment by
a vet. And if your dog’s stool changes in consistency or color, he
could have any one of a number of intestinal ailments; some of
those ailments are serious, while others may be less so. Either way,
by observing those changes sooner rather than later, you can get
him to the vet and start treating his problem that much quicker.
Finally, try to get a sense of what your dog’s normal activity level
is — whether he’s a hyperactive little dynamo, a laid-back kind of
a fella, or somewhere in between. Any prolonged changes in that
activity level could signal the onset of a medical problem that
needs your vet’s attention.
Checking vital signs
Your Beagle’s temperature, pulse, and respiration (TPR) are crucial
measurements of his health status. If your little hound’s tempera-
ture is above or below normal, if his heart rate is way faster than
usual, or if his breathing is quicker than it should be, he clearly
Chapter 11:Managing Your Beagle’s Day-to-Day Health 157

needs to see the vet pronto. But for you to know whether those
vital signs are normal, you need to know what normal is and how
to measure your own dog’s TPR.
Table 11-1 tells you what a Beagle’s normal TPR should be.
Table 11-1
Normal Vital Signs
Vital Sign
Normal Range
Temperature
100.5° Fahrenheit to 102.0° Fahrenheit
Pulse
60 to 140 beats per minute at rest
Respiration
10 to 30 breaths per minute at rest
Here’s what you need to know to measure your Beagle’s TPR.
Taking the temperature
To measure your dog’s temp, gather together three items:
 A clean, digital rectal thermometer (get one just for him, but
you can use any thermometer for humans from your local
pharmacy)
 Some petroleum jelly
 Another person
After you’ve got your gear:
1. Have the other person hold your Beagle still.
2. Smear some petroleum jelly on the thermometer bulb
(the end with the metal tip).
3. Slowly and gently slide the thermometer about 1 inch
into the dog’s rectum.
4. Wait for two minutes — and gently pet your dog or
engage him in another activity that will help him stay
calm and still.
5. Remove the thermometer slowly, and read it.
Measuring the pulse
All you need to take your pooch’s pulse is yourself, him —prefer-
ably after a nap or otherwise in a relaxed state — and a timer that
counts seconds. Then:
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
158

1. Have your Beagle lie down on his side.
Use a treat to lure him into a Down position (see
Chapter 15); then move the treat in a two o’clock or
ten o’clock direction — depending on which side he
prefers to lie on — to lure him into the proper position.
2. Sit behind your Beagle and place your hand atop his
hind leg.
3. Move your hand forward until your fingers are curled
around the front of the leg.
4. Slide your hand upward until your hand touches the
wall of your dog’s abdomen (see Figure 11-3). Your
hand should be resting on his inner hind leg.
Here, you feel a pulse beating beneath your fingers.
5. Count the beats for 15 seconds.
6. Multiply that number by four, and you’ll have your
dog’s heart rate per minute; compare that number to
the normal pulse rate listed earlier in Table 11-1.
Figure 11-3: Measure your Beagle’s pulse by placing your hand 
atop his inner hind leg.
Chapter 11:Managing Your Beagle’s Day-to-Day Health 159

Measuring respiration
To determine how many breaths your Beagle takes per minute,
grab a timer that counts seconds, and then:
1. Have him lie down on his side.
Get him into a Down position (see Chapter 15) by using a
treat; then move the treat in a two o’clock or ten o’clock
direction — depending on which side he prefers to lie on.
2. With your hand resting lightly on his rib cage, count how
often your hand rises in 15 seconds.
3. Multiply that number by four; compare that number to
the normal respiration rate listed earlier in Table 11-1.
Stocking a first-aid kit
You can be ready to deal with any illness or injury to your Beagle
by stocking up on first-aid gear and medications. A portion of a
bathroom medicine cabinet, a tackle box, or a toolbox are all good
places to stash the following items:
 Adhesive bandages (for small wounds)
 Antibiotic ointment
 Benadryl (25 mg)
 Buffered baby aspirin
 Cotton swabs or balls
 Eyedropper
 Flexible plastic digital rectal thermometer
 Gauze sponges
 Hand wipes
 Hydrogen peroxide (to clean wounds)
 Latex gloves
 Muzzle and leash
 Nonadhesive bandages
 1-inch adhesive tape
 Petroleum jelly (to soothe irritated areas)
 Small pair of scissors
 Soft padded gauze bandage on a roll

 Styptic powder or pencil
 Tweezers

Giving meds
Dispensing pills or liquid medication to a dog is no fun — mainly
because the dog often makes the job very difficult. Some pooches
fool their owners by holding the pill in their mouths and spitting it
out later (my own dog is a master at this maneuver). Others strug-
gle so much that you may be exhausted from the wrestling match
that ensues when you try to dispense the meds.
However, the job doesn’t have to be difficult. With a little confi-
dence and patience on your part, you can get a drug, whether in
pill or liquid form, into your dog with ease.
The pill drill
In most cases, you can bury a pill inside some soft food such as
peanut butter, cream cheese, or moist dog food. Alas, though,
some dogs don’t fall for this ploy: They eat the good stuff and leave
the pill in the dish. If your Beagle proves to be one of these crafty
canines, you’ll need to dispense the pill manually. Here’s how:
1. Place your dog in a sitting position (Chapter 15 tells you
how).
2. Tilt his head back about 45 degrees.
3. Gently run your fingers along his upper lips until your
fingers are about halfway back along the lip line. Place
a slight bit of pressure on both sides of the lips to open
the mouth.
4. Quickly place the pill as far back on the tongue as
possible.
5. Close the mouth and hold it.
6. Keeping his head tilted upward, gently rub his throat
until you feel him swallow the tablet.
Chapter 11:Managing Your Beagle’s Day-to-Day Health 161

Liquid potions
Administering liquid medicines is a bit trickier than dispensing
pills, because they can’t be readily mixed in with food. But you can
still do the job. Just find a clean eyedropper and proceed as follows:
1. Have your dog sit down (Chapter 15 can help).
2. Tilt his head upward and open his mouth by gently run-
ning your fingers along his lips until your fingers are
halfway back along the lip line. Then exert a small amount
of pressure on both side of the lips to open the mouth.
3. Fill the dropper with the proper amount of liquid, and
inject the liquid as far into the mouth as you can.
4. Close the mouth, hold it shut, and stroke the throat until
you feel him swallow the liquid.

O
f course you’re going give your Beagle the best of care. But no
matter how diligent you are in your efforts to keep him healthy,
eventually your dog will get sick. Some illnesses are serious; others
are not. This chapter helps you determine which of your little
hound’s health problems are emergencies, which ones are less so —
and how to deal with each, in partnership with your vet.
Treating Puppy Problems
Beagle puppies are almost always in the best of health, but occa-
sionally a problem befalls one of these little gals. Beyond the usual
cases of worms and such, a Beagle under the age of 1 year may
encounter one of the following conditions.
Cherry eye
This condition results when the tissue that holds the tear-produc-
ing gland in the dog’s third eyelid weakens, causing the gland to
pop out of place and become visible at the inner corner of the eye.
The gland looks like a cherry: round and bright red. The condition
isn’t painful — at least not initially — but without treatment, the
tear gland can become irritated or infected, or even cease to func-
tion. For that reason, you should put in a call to your vet as soon
as possible if your Beagle develops this condition.
Treatment consists of surgery that tacks the gland back into its
proper position.

Chondrodysplasia
Chondrodysplasia is a big name for a relatively rare disease that
keeps a Beagle very small. The condition prevents the bones and
vertebrae from growing properly, resulting in deformed vertebrae
and legs, and joint pain. Some people call the affected dogs “dwarf
Beagles.”
The disease usually shows up when the puppy is 3 to 4 weeks old.
Affected puppies don’t develop as quickly as their littermates,
have trouble moving, and appear to be in pain. By the time the pup
reaches 6 months of age, the growth plates of the bones have
matured and the puppy becomes more comfortable. However, she
may limp when she walks, her legs may be deformed, and her back
and neck appear abnormal. An X-ray taken when the puppy is no
more than 2 months old can illuminate the bone abnormalities that
are the hallmarks of this disease.
Chondrodysplasia has no cure, but medications can relieve the
pain that comes with the arthritis that results from this condition.
Puppy pyoderma
Sometimes a Beagle puppy develops what looks like mild acne
on the hairless area of her abdomen. This condition is called
puppy pyoderma, and it usually results from the presence of
Staphylococcus bacteria.
Puppy pyoderma is not a serious condition. Your vet can prescribe
special shampoos to treat the belly zits and speed their exit. In
severe cases, he may also prescribe an antibiotic.
Handling Adult Health Challenges
Generally, the period between 1 and 8 or 9 years of age finds your
Beagle in her prime. She’s not as vulnerable as she was when she
was a puppy, and she doesn’t have to cope with the frailties of old
age. Still, some maladies can befall the young and middle-aged
adult Beagle. Here’s a sampling of the most common.
Allergies
If your Beagle constantly scratches herself or if you just can’t seem
to get rid of her ear infections, she may suffer from an underlying
problem: allergies. Just like people, Beagles and other dogs can
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
164

develop allergic reactions to a wide variety of sources. These
allergy-triggering sources can include grass, pollen, carpeting, or
even certain foods.
Treatment for allergies depends on the severity of the problem and
the cause. Minor problems may be controllable with simple anti-
histamines and dietary adjustments, such as adding fatty acid sup-
plements. More severe problems require diagnostic testing.
Depending on the results of the tests — which, in the case of food
allergies, can take up to four months to perform — your vet may
recommend a complete change in diet or even allergy shots.
Allergies can’t be cured, but in many cases they can be controlled —
with time and patience. The result, however, will be a much more
comfortable Beagle.
Dental problems
The vast majority of dogs over the age of 3, including more than a
few Beagles, have some sort of dental problem: bad breath,
inflamed gums, and yellowing teeth. A veterinarian can take a look
at your dog’s teeth and confirm a diagnosis of dental disease.
Treatment of dental disease starts with a full cleaning that is per-
formed while the dog is under anesthesia. The cleaning includes
not only removing the tartar (the brown and yellow stuff) from the
teeth, but also extracting any teeth that have become loose. The
vet may also prescribe antibiotics to fight off any infections that
the dog’s dental disease may have caused.
You can prevent dental disease from occurring in the first place —
simply by brushing your Beagle’s teeth every day. See Chapter 10.
Hypothyroidism
Most of the time, the Beagle body does just what it’s supposed to
do, but occasionally the inner workings go awry. For example, if
your middle-aged Beagle starts putting on weight for no apparent
reason, becomes lethargic, and starts losing hair on both sides of
her body, she could suffer from hypothyroidism. This condition
occurs when the dog’s thyroid gland produces insufficient levels of
thyroid hormone. The skin may become scaly-looking and rough to
the touch, and become infected frequently. Chronic ear infections
and skin allergies also could signal the onset of this condition.
A blood test can confirm the veterinarian’s diagnosis. Daily doses
of synthetic thyroid hormone can control the condition and allow
your Beagle to live a completely normal life.
Chapter 12: Dealing with Health Issues 165

Idiopathic epilepsy
Epilepsy is fairly common among many dog breeds, including
Beagles, but very often the cause is unknown. Such epilepsy is
called idiopathic epilepsy, and it’s believed to be genetic in origin.
The first epileptic seizure usually occurs between 6 months and 4
years of age. A seizure usually starts when the dog falls on her side
(unless she’s already lying down). The head and neck arch, and the
mouth opens wide. The limbs extend fully and begin to move in a
jerky manner. The dog may lose control of her bowels or bladder,
and she may froth at the mouth. The seizure probably will last
about two minutes, although it can continue for longer. Afterward,
the dog sleeps for about 20 minutes. When she awakens, she may
walk aimlessly and be extremely hungry or thirsty.
If your Beagle has a seizure, your best immediate course of action
is no action at all. Just leave her alone, unless she is near a flight of
stairs — if that’s the case, move her to a safe place. And keep kids
and strangers away; even the nicest dog may bite during a seizure
because she’s scared, confused, or just completely out of it.
Your vet needs to see your Beagle if she has more than one seizure
or if the seizure is accompanied by other symptoms, such as vom-
iting or diarrhea. Your vet will perform an extensive examination
and lab tests to determine if the seizure has an obvious cause,
such as a brain tumor. If nothing turns up, epilepsy is likely and the
vet can prescribe medication such as phenobarbital or potassium
bromide, both of which can control seizures.
Intervertebral disc disease
If your normally active Beagle suddenly stops, yelps with pain, and
refuses to put weight on a paw, she may have developed a condi-
tion that’s quite common to this breed: intervertebral disc disease.
The disease results when a disc — the gelatinous cushion (like a
jelly doughnut) between two vertebrae — ruptures. When the rup-
ture occurs, the vertebrae no longer have a cushion, and the rup-
tured disc material may protrude and press onto the spinal cord.
Depending on where the rupture occurs and its severity, the dog
could experience paralysis in some or all of her legs. If you notice
your dog exhibiting symptoms of this disease, your dog needs to
see her vet as soon as possible.
At minimum, a myelogram — an X-ray of the spine after a dye has
been injected into the spinal fluid — is needed to determine whether
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
166

a dog has disc disease. However, the myelogram may not reveal a
disc rupture. In such cases, the veterinarian will order a CT scan or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to confirm the diagnosis.
The treatment for disc disease depends on how severe the problem
is. For relatively mild cases, a month of strict confinement to a crate
(the dog can’t leave the crate except to eliminate) plus administra-
tion of an anti-inflammatory medication may help. For more severe
cases — or if the problem recurs — surgery to relieve the pressure
on the spinal cord and remove the disc is the treatment of choice,
followed by several weeks of crate rest.
Easing Your Beagle’s Golden Years
The Beagle enters her senior years at around 8 to 10 years of age.
Why the range? Because every Beagle is an individual. The care
she’s been given, her genes, and her luck all play a role in deter-
mining not only her lifespan but also when she enters the twilight
of that lifespan. Rather than assume that your little hound is a
golden oldie at an arbitrary point in time, see if she’s showing signs
of impending seniorhood. Those signs include:
 Slowing down: Aging dogs aren’t all that different from aging
people — both species move more slowly than when they
were younger. As your Snoopy-dog enters her golden years,
she’ll probably take more time lying down for a nap, getting
up from that nap, and getting up and down the stairs than she
did when she was a youngster. She also probably won’t want
to chase a ball or retrieve a Frisbee for as long as she used to.
 Getting grayer: Gray or white hair, especially around the
eyes and muzzle, is a strong indicator of seniorhood.
 Having accidents: Many aging Beagles appear to forget
proper potty protocol. The causes can range from simply
having an aging bladder to developing a condition called
cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS), which I discuss in a
later section of this chapter.
 Being “out of it”: The senior Beagle who seems to get lost
in her own backyard or ignore you when you call her may
simply be showing her age. At this point in time, many dogs
lose some of their hearing or vision, which can cause them
to act disoriented.
 Freaking out more often: Loud noises, such as fireworks and
thunderstorms, may not have upset your Beagle during her
youth, but that could change once she hits seniorhood.
Chapter 12: Dealing with Health Issues 167

Although all these developments may herald the onset of canine
old age, they could also signal the presence of serious illness.
Don’t attribute any of these changes to mere seniorhood; have
your vet check your Beagle over.
Checkups are, in fact, a great way to help your Beagle’s seniorhood
be truly golden. Start by stepping up her wellness exams. Most
vets want to see your aging Beagle twice a year rather than once a
year once she’s truly an oldie-but-goodie. The reason: Frequent
checkups give your vet that much more opportunity to uncover
any possible problems.
In between visits, keep a careful eye on your senior Snoopy-dog for
any changes in her physical demeanor or behavior. Some of those
changes can mean the onset of diseases or conditions that are
common to senior Beagles. Here are a few.
Arthritis
Arthritis is most commonly found among older dogs, although it can
strike a dog of any age. When the cartilage that covers the bones
becomes worn, the bones that form the joints rub up against each
other. The joints become inflamed, and painful arthritis results.
The arthritic Beagle has more trouble getting around than the
more agile Snoopy-dog does and may have trouble lying down for a
nap or getting up from one. Negotiating stairs and taking walks
may become challenging.
To confirm a diagnosis, your dog’s vet needs to examine the affected
limb(s) and the rest of the body. He may also take X-rays of the
affected joints. Fortunately, remedies for arthritis abound. They
include:
 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): These range
from common aspirin to state-of-the-art meds such as Rimadyl
and Deramaxx.
 Nutritional supplements: Glucosamine and chrondroitin sulfate
are examples. They come in tablets, liquid, or injectable form.
 Acupuncture: The traditional Chinese healing method
employs specially placed needles to bring the body into
proper balance.
 Dietary adjustments: Reducing the amount of food your dog
eats helps pare poundage from an overweight Beagle and thus
reduces strain on the joints.
 Surgery: Your vet may suggest this in certain cases.
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
168

Giving your arthritic Beagle moderate exercise can do a great deal
to alleviate arthritis pain. One or two daily walks, regular swims, or
other gentle, regular exercise can help a stiff, sore Beagle stay a
little more limber and reduce her discomfort. Most importantly,
keep your dog slim enough so you can feel her ribs. A sleek
physique lessens strain on the joints.
Cancer
Cancer is one of the most common diseases to strike dogs of any
age. According to the Animal Cancer Institute at the University of
Colorado, one in five dogs will develop cancer during her lifetime.
Those odds rise considerably when a dog ages. The Veterinary
Cancer Center at the University of Colorado reports that 45 per-
cent of all dogs over the age of 10 die from cancer.
The signs of canine cancer are similar to those of human cancer.
They include:
 Abnormal swellings that persist or continue to grow
 Appetite loss
 Bleeding or discharge from any body opening
 Difficulty breathing, urinating, or defecating
 Difficulty eating or swallowing
 Hesitation to exercise or loss of stamina
 Offensive, unexplained odor
 Persistent lameness or stiffness
 Sores that don’t heal
 Unexplained weight loss
In addition, seizures, unresolved vomiting, and a change in
demeanor can signal the onset of cancer, particularly if one or
more symptoms in the list above also are present.
Canine cancer can take many forms. Among the most common are
lymphoma (cancer of the lymphatic system), skin cancers, and
bone cancer. A cancer diagnosis is not necessarily a death sentence
for a dog. Treatment can include surgery, chemotherapy (the good
news here: Dogs generally tolerate chemo much better than people
do), radiation, and a change in diet. In addition, many scientists are
working aggressively to improve treatments for cancer in dogs.
Chapter 12: Dealing with Health Issues 169

Cognitive dysfunction syndrome
One of the many ways that humans and dogs are similar is that
both can acquire a disease in which proteins form plaque deposits
on the brain. These deposits cause a wide range of behavioral
changes, including apathy, anxiety, confusion, disorientation, and
a changed sleep cycle. In human beings, the condition is known
as Alzheimer’s disease; in dogs, the disease is called cognitive
dysfunction syndrome (CDS).
To diagnose CDS, a veterinarian may perform blood tests, urinaly-
sis, testing of thyroid and adrenocortical hormone levels, and CT
scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.
Two treatments can help delay the effects of CDS.
 Anipryl: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
approved this drug specifically to help reduce the symptoms
of CDS.
 Prescription Diet Canine b/d: Hills Pet Foods, which manu-
factures the product, says this food is designed to combat the
effects of aging on the canine brain, even when those effects
are as extreme as CDS symptoms can be.
Diabetes
Many breeds, including Beagles, can acquire diabetes, which
results when the pancreas produces insufficient insulin, a hormone
that enables the body to process sugar in the blood. Older dogs
and overweight dogs are especially vulnerable. Symptoms include:

170
What about health insurance?
In theory, pet health insurance sounds like a great idea. Just like with human beings,
health insurance for pets allows you to prepay some of the future veterinary costs
that your Beagle is likely to incur. However, theory and practice aren’t always iden-
tical. Before you sign up for any health insurance plan for your little hound, look
carefully at the deductibles and reimbursement rates, and crunch some numbers.
Check, too, for strange conditions or exceptions. For example, at least one major
health insurer covers the cost of spaying or neutering but not the cost of the anes-
thesia required for either procedure (no, I’m not kidding).
Your objective here is to make sure that you don’t end up paying more for your
Beagle’s health care than you would if you hadn’t signed up for insurance at all.

 Increased thirst and urination
 Weight loss despite an increased appetite
 Cloudiness of the eye
Blood tests and analysis of a urine sample confirm the diagnosis.
Treatment is the same as for humans: injections of the insulin the
body can’t produce by itself. The condition can’t be cured, but a
lifelong program of medication, nutritional management (to reduce
or maintain weight), and regular exercise can enable the diabetic
Beagle to live a long, healthy life.
Even if your Beagle is disease free, you need to adjust your rou-
tines to your little hound’s age. If the stairs are getting to be too
much for her, pick her up and carry her. If her eyesight is failing,
reconsider whether you want to rearrange your furniture. If her
hearing is on the wane, start teaching her how to respond to hand
signals as well as audio cues (Chapter 14 shows you how). If her
metabolism is slowing down and she’s starting to look a little
pudgy, adjust her food regimen accordingly.
My Beagle Is Sick! What
Should I Do?
No matter how careful you are with your Snoopy-dog, the time will
come when she’s clearly not feeling well. But even though your
Beagle may exhibit symptoms of illness that frighten you, not all of
those symptoms signal the presence of a life-threatening or even
serious condition. In this section, I identify signs of illness that
require an immediate trip to your vet or emergency clinic, signs that
require a phone call, and signs that may not signify illness at all.
Call the doggy ambulance
There’s no such thing as an ambulance for dogs (at least not that I
know of), but the following symptoms should prompt you to get
your Beagle to your veterinarian or emergency clinic immediately.
Breathing problems
If your Beagle seems to be having trouble breathing, she needs to
see her vet right away. She could be suffering from life-threatening
heart or lung problems, pneumonia, heartworms, anemia (perhaps
caused by an undetected internal injury), or obstructions in the
Chapter 12: Dealing with Health Issues 171

respiratory tract. Even excess weight can force your four-legged
friend to literally gasp for breath. A runny nose qualifies, too. If
your Beagle has a cloudy or bloody nasal discharge, she needs a
vet’s attention immediately.
Changed gum color
If your Beagle’s normally pink gums turn white, blue, yellow, or red,
get her to a vet pronto. The various colors may indicate anemia,
shock, breathing problems, liver or gall bladder disease, blood poi-
soning, severe infection, or heat stroke. Unexplained bruising of
the gums is an emergency, too.
Hyperthermia
Hyperthermia is the condition that results when a dog is
overheated — and an overheated dog is a dog whose life is in
danger. She’s likely to be panting to an extreme, have a dark red
tongue and gums, and be extremely lethargic. She also may be
confused, experience shallow or rapid breathing, vomit blood,
and collapse.
Have someone else phone your vet while you cool down your dog.
Immerse her body in a tub of tepid to cool (but not icy) water,
spray her with water from a hose that’s not been out in the sun, or
apply cold wet compresses to her face, neck, feet, and armpits.
After the soaking, get her to a vet so she can be treated for any
problem resulting from the excessive heat.
Never, ever leave your Beagle in a parked car when the outdoor
temperature is 70 degrees or more, not even in the shade with some
windows rolled partway down. The interior temperature can exceed
100 degrees in a matter of minutes and kill your little hound.
Hypothermia
If your Beagle has cold legs or rigid muscles, shivers deeply, and
acts lethargic, she may be experiencing hypothermia, the opposite
of hyperthermia. Wrap your dog in blankets, put her in your car,
and hot-foot it to your vet’s.
Your Beagle’s coat is too short to protect her against extremely
cold temps for very long. If you’re going to be out on a frigid day
for more than a few minutes, put on her doggy coat or sweater.
Obvious trauma
If your Beagle experiences any clearly traumatic event, such as a
fall or being hit by a car, she needs to see a vet right away, even if
she seems to be OK. She could have a life-threatening internal
injury.
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
172

Persistent vomiting
A Beagle who vomits frequently over several hours — particularly
if the vomitus contains blood or foreign material — may have a
major malady. The many possible causes include ingesting a for-
eign object, poisoning, pancreatitis, kidney disease, cancer, or
inflammatory bowel syndrome. Some of these causes are life-
threatening, while others aren’t. But only a vet can tell you why
your dog can’t keep anything down, and to do that, he needs to see
her. For that reason, persistent vomiting qualifies as a symptom
that requires a vet’s immediate attention.
If you think your dog’s problem is caused by poisoning, have some-
one call the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center. The specialists
there can determine what antidote your Beagle needs, and the
caller can forward that info to you and your vet. A phone consult to
the center costs $55; you can pay with plastic. The phone number
is 888-426-4435. More info is available at www.aspca.org/apcc.
Significant bleeding
If your Beagle bleeds from anywhere so extensively that the bleed-
ing continues even after a pressure bandage has been applied for
15 to 20 minutes, she needs to see a vet right away. Bleeding that
spurts or pulses outward for any length of time also requires a
vet’s immediate attention.
If you accidentally cut the quick of your dog’s nail while trimming,
don’t panic and don’t call your vet. Just check out Chapter 10.
Staggering
Is your Beagle walking as though she’s had several beers too many?
If so, she may have ingested antifreeze — a potentially fatal dietary
indiscretion — or have a metabolic problem. Get her to a vet pronto.
Sudden collapse
A Beagle whose legs suddenly buckle underneath her needs to see
a vet pronto, even if she remains conscious. She could be suffering
from heart problems or the worsening of an illness.
Sudden eye change
An eye that suddenly becomes red, changes color, or shows a
change in the size of the pupil needs prompt veterinary attention.
Possible causes are glaucoma, which leads to blindness if not
treated promptly, or another eye condition called anterior uveitis.
Chapter 12: Dealing with Health Issues 173

Give your vet a heads-up
The symptoms listed here may signal problems that are potentially
serious but not immediately life-threatening. Your best response to
these problems is to call your veterinarian as soon as possible. If
you first notice any of these symptoms after hours, though, it’s
okay to wait until morning to make the call.
Appetite changes
If your Beagle bypasses her meal more than a couple of times, she
could have a serious medical problem. The same is true if your dog
suddenly starts eating much more food than usual. Increased food
intake is a common symptom of diabetes, a condition that often
befalls older dogs.
Bad breath
Hoochy poochie breath is no laughing matter, despite all the joking
references to “dog breath” that we hear. Your foul-mouthed Beagle
may have dental disease — discussed earlier in this chapter — or
other problem such as diabetes, kidney disease, sinus problems,
or a problem with her immune system. All require a vet’s attention.
Behavioral changes
A sudden or extreme change in your Beagle’s behavior or personal-
ity can indicate that something physical is amiss. A disoriented
older dog may have cognitive dysfunction syndrome or may be
losing her eyesight or hearing. Lethargy and depression can signal
the presence of many dangerous conditions.
If your dog’s personality has changed significantly, check on your
own for any physical signs of illness — but also call your vet. Share
with him what you’ve discovered to put your Beagle on the road to
recovery that much faster.
Body odor
A Beagle with BO is not necessarily normal. Unless your dog has
rolled in something gross, her stinkiness could result from sebor-
rhea (which also causes hair loss, flaking, and greasy skin), an
infected wound, or cancer. In any case, she needs a vet’s attention.
Constipation
A dog who goes for more than two days without taking a dump
may simply be constipated, or may have an intestinal blockage
caused by a foreign object or a tumor. Call your vet.
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
174

Diarrhea
All dogs get the runs sometime, often more than once. Such
instances usually result from a dietary goof or a tummy bug. A 
12-hour fast, followed by a bland diet of hamburger and rice, usu-
ally gives the digestive tract time to recover. But if your Beagle’s
diarrhea lasts for more than a day, put in a call to your vet. Call
sooner if she exhibits any other symptoms listed in this chapter.
Hair loss
Doggy baldness is not normal. If your dog is losing so much hair
that she’s got bald spots, she could be suffering from one of several
conditions. Call your vet.
Lameness
The Beagle who favors one leg over the others needs to see her vet
as soon as possible. This condition isn’t a dire emergency, but it
could reflect serious problems that range from arthritis to bone
cancer. A dog who favors one leg, then the other, may have arthri-
tis or a heart valve infection. Either way, she needs to see her vet.
Lumps and bumps
If you find a lump under your Snoopy-dog’s skin, call your vet as
soon as possible during business hours, and make an appointment
for him to see your four-legged friend. But don’t panic: The lump
may not be cancerous. Warts, fatty tumors, and cysts also can
make your dog feel lumpy. Your vet can tell you what’s going on.
Sores that don’t heal
A cut or sore that doesn’t heal may signal a serious condition such
as cancer, or a less serious (but frustrating) condition called acral
lick granuloma. Either way, the dog needs to see her veterinarian,
who can run the proper tests and determine the cause of the
problem.
Stinky ears
A stinky-eared Beagle is probably a pretty unhappy Beagle. Her
problem probably results from a painful ear infection. If such infec-
tions occur frequently, they may reflect an underlying problem such
as allergies or hypothyroidism. Successful treatment requires a vet
to address not only the infection itself but also determine the cause.
Unexplained weight gain or loss
A Beagle who’s porking out or getting skinny for no clear reason
could be more than a little sick. If you notice a change in your
Beagle’s bod either way, but can’t figure out why, make that call.
Chapter 12: Dealing with Health Issues 175

Unusual fatigue
If your Beagle seems to suddenly lose energy and fails to regain it,
your vet needs to know. Such lethargy could be a symptom of
anemia, kidney disease, liver disease, hypothyroidism, obesity,
arthritis, or cancer.
Weird-looking poop
Poop that changes from its usual color or otherwise looks odd
could signal one of many problems, and requires a vet’s attention.
Unusual-looking poop includes:
 Black or dark brown poop: This indicates bleeding that could
result from a tumor, an ulcer, kidney or liver problems, or
inflammatory bowel disease. Other possibilities are parasites, a
bleeding tooth, bleeding in the mouth, dental disease, or even
swallowing the blood that results from an overlicked paw.
 Grayish, greasy-looking poop: Poop that looks like this may
indicate that your Beagle can’t digest the fats in his food.
Other possible causes of gray poop may be urinary stones, a
tumor, or an inflammation of the pancreas.
Not to worry . . .
The following conditions appear worrisome but actually don’t
require a vet’s attention.
Butt-dragging
Nothing is seriously wrong if your Beagle starts dragging her
bottom across the ground. The likely cause is anal sacs that need
to be expressed, or emptied. You can do this thankless task your-
self by following the steps in Chapter 10, or you can ask your vet to
do the job.
Cloudy discharge from the penis
If your Beagle boy discharges a bit of cloudy stuff from his penis,
watch his bathroom behavior. If he has no problems peeing, there’s
no need to call the vet.
Noisy breathing
Sometimes a dog starts to breathe in a way that resembles a
human asthma attack. Vets call such breathing reverse sneezing,
and it’s nothing to worry about. The condition generally abates
within a few minutes — but if it doesn’t, call your vet.

Saying Goodbye to Your Beagle
Living with a Beagle — or, for that matter, any dog — has to be one
of life’s greatest joys. But for all those joys, dog ownership brings
one sorrow that is almost certainly inevitable: We almost always
live longer than our dogs do. That means the time will come when
you will need to face your Beagle’s impending death and say good-
bye to her.
In all likelihood, that time will come when your Beagle is 10 to 14
years old. In some unfortunate instances, it could occur sooner; if
you and your Snoopy-dog are very lucky, it will occur later. No
matter when the end comes, however, you need to be prepared for
it — not only for your sake but also for your dog’s.
Fortunately, we can limit the suffering of our canine companions
and allow them to die with dignity, thanks to euthanasia. But with
this ability comes the responsibility to use this power wisely — to
know when the time is right to euthanize. How can you tell when
the time has come? Answering these questions can give you clues:
 How’s my Beagle doing? If your dog is still interested in the
world around her, eating with gusto, and enjoying your com-
pany, she may be able to stick around a little longer. On the
other hand, if she’s apathetic, in constant pain, and losing her
appetite, now may be the right time to let her go.
 How am I doing? Your state of mind should count for some-
thing in this decision. If your Beagle has a terminal illness but
still seems healthy, you may not want to euthanize her yet. On
the other hand, if you’re providing nursing care for your ter-
minally ill dog — and if that care is becoming more than you
can handle physically, emotionally, and financially — it may
be time to consider euthanasia.
 What will happen? Find out from your vet how your dog’s
condition will progress. If your dog will suffer or lose her dig-
nity, or if you and your family will face undue hardship, now
may be the time to let her go.
When you’ve decided that the time has come to let your dog go, you
can follow these suggestions to make the process a little easier:
 Make arrangements with your veterinarian beforehand, if at
all possible. Most clinics will allow you to pay for the proce-
dure in advance and will allow you to choose how you want
your dog’s body to be disposed.
Chapter 12: Dealing with Health Issues 177

 Try to book your appointment at the end of the day. This
allows your vet to spend some time with you and not have to
rush off to see another patient.
 Arrange to be off work at the time of the procedure, if you
can. At this time, it’s hard to even put up a pretense of work-
ing, much less actually get something done.
The procedure is brief and painless for your Beagle. Your vet or
a technician probably will prepare an intravenous catheter (IV)
and place it in one of your dog’s veins. The vet then pumps a
sedative through the IV to cause your dog to go to sleep, and then
administers the euthanasia solution. Some vets do the procedure
in one step.
Many owners choose to stay with their pets during the euthanasia
procedure. If you can maintain sufficient composure to comfort
your Beagle, you won’t regret having stayed with her as she goes
to a better place. On the other hand, if you can’t bear the thought
of watching your Beagle die, don’t feel you have to stay — your
reaction could add to your dog’s stress. Either way, you are in the
best position to decide what’s best for both of you.
Afterward, you’re likely to feel devastated — but, if your Beagle
had a prolonged illness, you may also feel relief. Either feeling is
okay. What’s important is that you’ve given your Beagle the gift of
a dignified death — the final gift in life that was filled with love.
For more information on euthanizing a beloved canine companion —
making the decision, experiencing the actual process, and coping
with the aftermath — consult my own book, Senior Dogs For
Dummies (Wiley), which contains an extensive discussion on
coping with the end of a beloved dog’s life.

Traveling (or Not)
with Your Beagle
In This Chapter

 Flying with your dog
 Leaving your dog at home

I
nto almost every person’s life comes some travel — but if you
have a Beagle, travel leads to questions: What shall I do with my
dog? Should I take him with me — and if so, how? Should I leave
him home — and if so, with whom? Should I take him somewhere
else — and if so, where?
This chapter answers those questions — or, more accurately, helps
you find answers that are best for you, your Beagle, and the cir-
cumstances in which you find yourself traveling.
Taking Your Beagle with You
Does the thought of leaving your Snoopy-dog behind when you go
away on vacation induce more than just a pang of sadness? Does
the idea of traveling with your little hound elicit feelings of excite-
ment? Perhaps, then, you should give in to your feelings and take
your Beagle with you when you head out of town.
Notice, though, that I say perhaps. Not every trip you take is one that
your Beagle should take as well. It’s crucial to consider whether the
trip will be as much fun for your Beagle as it will be for you.
For example, if your planned sojourn involves tooling around all
day while your dog cools his heels in a hotel room (even at a pet-
friendly hotel), you may want to reconsider. Even if you contain

your Beagle in a crate, and even if he doesn’t bark from sheer lone-
liness, he most certainly won’t be as happy as he would be if he
were either in his own home or at a place where he can play and
have a good time.
On the other hand, if you’re going someplace where you can hang
around with your Beagle most of the time and can keep him safely
crated during the few occasions when he can’t be with you, bring-
ing your little hound along may be a good idea.
Your Beagle’s welfare must be your first consideration when you’re
trying to decide whether to bring him with you when you travel. I
guarantee that if he’s not happy on your trip, you won’t be happy
either.
Riding in cars (and trucks)
with Beagles
Your Beagle’s most frequent form of transportation is likely to be in
a car — after all, that’s probably how you get around most often.
But just as you need to take certain precautions to keep yourself
safe while motoring down the highway, so must you protect your
little hound while he’s along for the ride.
The most important step you can take to keep your dog safe in the
car is to secure him in the back seat with either a doggy seat belt
or in a crate that’s buckled into the back seat. A Beagle who’s
allowed free rein of the back seat could be in serious trouble in the
event of a sudden stop or an accident. He could fall off the seat and
break a leg, or even become a projectile that lands in the front seat
with you. Figure 13-1 shows a Beagle safely buckled into the back
seat of a car using a doggy seat belt.
Doggy seat belts are available at just about any pet superstore,
such as Petco or PetsMart. The devices come with detailed direc-
tions on how to use them, but they’re not that tough to work with
after you and your dog become accustomed to them. Most doggy
seat belts consist of a piece of nylon fabric that extends down the
length of the dog’s chest, two nylon straps that surround the dog’s
body, and a loop that extends from the back. First, you secure the
straps around the dog, and then you run a seat belt through the
loop. Voilà! Your dog is safe and secure.
Do not place your Beagle in a seat that has an airbag. If the airbag
deploys, your dog could be seriously injured or even killed. Keep
your Beagle out of the front seat altogether — and if your car has
side airbags in the back seat, place him in the center of the back
seat.
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
180

Figure 13-1: Buckle up your Beagle to keep him safe in your car.
If your vehicle of choice is an SUV or pickup truck, your Beagle still
belongs in a seat away from the airbag. And under no circum-
stances should you let your dog ride in the truck bed or cargo area
of your vehicle.
No matter where your Beagle sits, though, make sure that his
entire body is in the car. That means keep the windows rolled up,
or otherwise restrain him so his head’s not hanging out the
window. He may like feeling the wind blowing through his ears, but
the price for that enjoyment could be dust or other irritants get-
ting into his eyes.
Of course, car safety consists of much more than securing your
dog with a seat belt. Other considerations include weather and
whether to leave your dog alone in the car.
Don’t leave a dog in a car if the outdoor temperature is above 70
degrees. The temperature inside the car can climb to well over 100
degrees in a just a few minutes — even if you open the windows
and park the car in the shade — resulting in heatstroke, which can
be fatal. If you must go someplace where you can’t bring your
Beagle and the weather is balmy, leave your dog at home! Frankly,
leaving your dog alone in a car is never a good idea.

Leavin’ on a jet plane
So you want to go someplace far, far away — too far to drive.
Hopping on a plane seems to be the best way to get there. And
you’re wondering whether you can take your beloved Beagle
with you.
Maybe you can — but that doesn’t mean that you should.
Air travel can be incredibly stressful for Beagles and other pets. For
one thing, unless your pet is small enough to fit in a carrier that can
be stowed under the seat in front of you, your four-legged friend has
to ride with the rest of the baggage. The noise, the absence of famil-
iar surroundings — not to mention the absence of familiar people —
do not make for a relaxed traveling environment for your dog.
And that’s assuming that the airlines will even accept your Beagle.
During the summer months, when temperatures are high, they

Helping the carsick canine
Although most dogs love to go for rides in cars, a few find the experience to be nau-
seating — literally. If your Beagle turns out to be one of these unhappy pooches,
you may be able to help him. Here are some ideas:
 Run him on empty. The dog who tosses his cookies when he’s in the car may do
better if he’s got no cookies to toss. Try not to feed your Beagle for six hours or
so before you hit the road.
 Desensitize him. Try just sitting in the car with your dog and running the engine
for a few minutes at a time over the course of a few days to get him used to
being in the car. After he can handle that, graduate to short rides and work up
to longer trips.
 Freshen the air. Opening the windows a little bit can give your dog the fresh air
he needs to quell his queasiness.
 Give him some meds. For many pets, a little bit of dimenhydrinate (Dramamine)
given an hour or so before a trip can allay carsickness — although it may also
make him drowsy. Consult your vet about the proper dosage.
 Offer some flower power. Some Beagles benefit from being given a few drops
of Bach Rescue Remedy, a natural flower essence, several hours before a trip.
These and other flower essences are available from health-food stores.

won’t. Airlines have a good reason for that policy: Temperatures on
the airport tarmac and in the baggage compartment get extremely
hot — hot enough to cause heatstroke and even kill your dog.
For that reason, I recommend not traveling by air with your Beagle
unless you absolutely have to. Either choose a vacation site that’s
within easy driving distance, suck it up and drive the longer dis-
tance that you’d planned to fly, or leave your dog at home.
That said, however, a time may come when you have to ship your
Beagle by air — for example, if you’re moving overseas and want to
bring your little hound with you. If that’s your situation, keep the
following suggestions in mind:
 Start planning early. A prudent owner plans her Beagle’s trip
well in advance — say, six months before departure. That’s
because most countries require owners to show that pets are
healthy enough to cross their borders. Some countries merely
require current rabies’ vaccinations, while others demand
that the owner complete numerous forms and certifications
before allowing a dog to enter. Still other countries require
that entering pets be quarantined in a commercial kennel for
days, weeks, or even months before allowing them to join
their owners. Find out, too, how long these certifications last.
By starting the planning process early, you’ll have plenty of
time to fulfill the requirements of your destination, and also
get the flight and/or kennel space that you need.
 Do your homework. As soon as possible, find out the animal
transport regulations of the place you’re moving to. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS) maintains listings of U.S. and foreign countries’
animal transport regulations at www.aphis.usda.gov/ac/
pettravel.html. The same site also includes some tips
for traveling by air with pets. For information on airlines’
requirements — particularly with respect to crates and
carriers — contact individual carriers.
 Get help from your vet. Your veterinarian can help you
obtain any health certificates you need for your Beagle and
can also suggest ways to make him feel more comfortable
while traveling.
 Limit stops. Book the most direct flight possible, even if it
costs more than a flight with one or more layovers. The fewer
stops you make, the fewer chances you have that something
will go wrong during the trip.
Chapter 13: Traveling (or Not) with Your Beagle 183

 Call a pro. Professional animal transporters can maximize
your Beagle’s chances of arriving safely at your destination,
and minimize the hassles that arise when you try to arrange
such transportation yourself. For a list of professional animal
transporters, contact the Independent Pet and Animal
Transportation Association International Inc. The organiza-
tion’s Web site, www.ipata.com, has a searchable database
that enables you to locate an animal transporting company in
your area.
Picking pet-friendly lodging
No matter how you and your Beagle travel, you need to a place to
stay after you reach your destination. These days, though, finding
Beagle-friendly accommodations isn’t all that difficult. That’s
because the hospitality business has seen the light when it comes
to welcoming man’s (and woman’s) best friend. Many establish-
ments that once barred the door to canine guests now realize that
putting up those dogs can lead to big bucks and return visits from
the dogs’ grateful owners. As a result, more hotels, motels, and
even bed-and-breakfasts are rolling out the red carpet for you and
your Beagle than ever before.
So how do you find these pet-friendly lodgings? Start by picking up
some guidebooks and magazines aimed at the dog-owning traveler.
Such publications abound in this era of bringing the canine member
of the family along with everyone else. Among the magazines and
Web sites available are Fido Friendly (a one-year subscription to the
print magazine is $12; more info at www.fidofriendly.com); Pets
on the Go ($15 per year for premium membership; more info at
www.petsonthego.com); and Dog Friendly (a free e-mail newsletter
you can order at www.dogfriendly.com).
Wanna go by the book? Check out these tomes: Traveling with Your
Pet — The AAA PetBook: 8th Edition by the American Automobile
Club (AAA); Pets on the Go: The Definitive Pet Accommodation and
Vacation Guide by Dawn and Robert Habgood (Dawbert Press); and
Fodor’s Road Guide USA: Where to Stay with Your Pet, 1st Edition by
Andrea Arden (Fodor’s).
After you identify a place to stay, however, don’t just breeze into
the reception area with your Beagle in tow. Call first to make sure
an establishment’s pet-friendly policy remains in effect; to learn
the rules for staying with a pet at the facility; and to find out in
advance whether the facility requires a pet deposit and/or an extra
fee for nonhuman guests (many do).

Packing your Beagle’s suitcase
Just as you pack your own suitcase when you travel, so should you
pack one for your Snoopy-dog. Of course, the suitcase need not lit-
erally be a suitcase; a tote bag or old backpack is just as good.
Whatever you choose, though, plan on bringing the following:
 Your Beagle’s crate: That way he’ll have a cozy, familiar place
to stay when you’re not in the room — and you’ll prevent the
room from being damaged. In fact, many hotels require that
dogs be crated when owners aren’t in the room with them.
 Dog food: A trip is no time to change your Beagle’s diet. Pack
enough of his regular food to keep his tummy comfy for the
duration of the trip — or know whether you can buy his food
in the area where you’re traveling. And don’t forget his treats!
 A couple of toys: Pack your dog’s two or three favorite toys
along with all of his other gear. He’ll enjoy being able to play
with familiar objects, especially when he’s in unfamiliar
surroundings.
 Collar and leash: Duh! Don’t leave home without these!
 Immunization record: If your dog becomes sick on the road
and needs a veterinarian’s care, you’ll need to furnish proof of
immunizations. Your vet can provide this record easily.
 Something with your scent: A T-shirt or other object with
your scent on it can provide considerable comfort to your
Beagle when he’s left alone.
 Plastic bags: Be a good dog owner: Bring a bunch of plastic
bags so you can clean up your Beagle’s bathroom deposits.
Chapter 13: Traveling (or Not) with Your Beagle 185
Going visiting?
Just because you’re visiting your parents, your cousin Judy, or your best friend from
high school, don’t assume that your Beagle is as welcome as you are. Not everyone
is thrilled with the prospect of hosting a canine guest — and as the human guest,
you need to respect this perspective, no matter how incomprehensible it is to you.
Always, always ask your host or hostess whether your Beagle is welcome in his or
her home. If the answer is yes, pack your Beagle’s bag just as you would if you were
staying in a hotel — and show the same consideration for a host’s property that you
would at a five-star commercial establishment. And if the answer is no — well, make
other arrangements for your dog, or stay home with him.

Leaving Your Beagle Home
Sometimes bringing your Beagle with you isn’t a good idea. Maybe
you’re flying, or maybe you won’t be able to spend much time with
your Snoopy-dog while you’re on the road, or perhaps your little
hound isn’t welcome at your destination. Whatever the reason,
you need to find someplace else for your four-legged friend to stay
while you’re away. One option may be your home.
The friend option
If you have a dog-loving friend, consider asking her to stay in your
home as a housesitter/Beagle companion while you’re gone. That
way, you know that your home won’t be left vacant while you’re
gone, and you can relax knowing that your Beagle has some com-
pany. This is a great option to consider if you’re going to be away
for more than a couple of days. Make sure, though, that your friend
has the info she needs to take proper care of your Beagle; the sec-
tion “What your pet sitter needs to know” suggests what to tell
your friend.
Picking a pet sitter
If you’ll only be away for two or three days, a professional pet
sitter who visits your home two or three times a day may be just
who you need to keep your Beagle happy and set your mind at rest
while you’re away.
How do you find this lifesaver? Start by asking your veterinarian.
He may be able to refer you to a trustworthy individual or com-
pany. Failing that, you can consult one or both of the following 
pet-sitting organizations: the National Association of Professional
Pet Sitters (www.petsitters.org) or Pet Sitters International
(www.petsit.com). Both organizations’ Web sites allow you to
search by zipcode for a pet-sitting company or individual who’s
located near you. When you contact a person or company, find
out the following:
 Has the person who will come to your home had a criminal
background check? You want to be sure that whoever comes
into your home to take care of your beloved Beagle has no
criminal history, particularly of animal abuse. If the company
or person can’t or won’t provide this information, walk away.
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
186

 Do you have references? Get at least three, and call them.
Make sure, too, that these references are clients, not personal
friends of the pet sitter. Ask the client how long the pet sitter
cared for the pet and how he or she views the experience.
 Do you offer a service contract? A savvy sitter will specify in
writing the services that he or she will perform while you’re
away. Make sure you see a service contract and agree to the
terms before you depart.
 What’s your backup plan? If the sitter becomes ill or otherwise
can’t visit your home, what will happen to your Beagle? This
question is especially important if you’re interviewing an indi-
vidual rather than a company — although in both instances,
they should give you a detailed backup plan ensuring that your
dog will be cared for no matter what happens.
 Can you come for a visit? An understanding sitter will realize
that your Beagle needs to meet his substitute caregiver before
you employ her. That way, you can see how the sitter interacts
with your dog, and the sitter can see the layout of your home
and ask any specific questions she may have.
What your pet sitter needs to know
If you want your Beagle to have optimum care from a pet sitter
or housesitter, you need to provide the sitter with detailed infor-
mation about your trip and your dog’s needs. Here’s the written
information you should provide when you give her your key:
 Location of all supplies: Make sure your sitter knows where
you keep your Beagle’s food, leash, collar, toys, medications,
and anything else she’ll need to care for your four-legged
friend.
 Your itinerary: Give your sitter information on when you’re
leaving, when you’ll return, and a phone number to reach you.
 Contact information: Your sitter should have the telephone
number of your regular veterinarian and, if available, an emer-
gency veterinary clinic.
Boarding Your Beagle
If you plan to be away for more than a few days and you can’t
take your Beagle along, consider taking him to a place where he’s
Chapter 13: Traveling (or Not) with Your Beagle 187

welcome. By going to a boarding kennel or even to the home of a
dog-loving friend, you can be sure that your pooch is getting the
best of care at a home away from home.
A little help from a friend
My family and I recently took a Caribbean cruise — obviously, an
excursion upon which our dog could not join us. But we had no
worries. We took our beloved Allie to stay with someone who was
thrilled to spend time with our girl: her breeder. If you bought your
Beagle from a reputable breeder who lives near you, you may be
able to do the same thing. In other instances, we’ve taken our dogs
to stay with dog-loving friends of ours. Every time we’ve exercised
these options, we’ve enjoyed our vacations more, knowing that our
dogs were having nice vacations, too.
A friend is much more likely to agree to take care of your dog while
you’re away if you make clear your eagerness to return the favor!
Make sure that anyone who cares for your Beagle is an experienced
owner and is someone your dog knows and trusts. A few practice
sessions — say, a few afternoons or even an overnight stay at your
breeder’s or friend’s home — can help put your dog at ease and can
help you and your friend deal with any questions that may arise.
Finding a boarding kennel
If you don’t have a friend who can care for your Beagle, you can
pay to have experts take care of him. Plenty of places specialize in
boarding dogs, and the offerings range from somewhat spartan to
positively luxurious.
On the spartan-but-still-OK side may be your own vet. Many veteri-
nary clinics offer boarding services for their clients. The staff will
feed your dog, let him exercise in a kennel run, and check on him
periodically. You may also be able to arrange to have him groomed
during his stay. The big plus to this option is that it’s probably the
cheapest; the possible minus is that your dog won’t be living in the
lap of luxury.
At the other end of the spectrum are what can only be called dog
resorts. If Zagat’s, Michelin, or the American Automobile Association
(AAA) rated boarding kennels, these facilities would draw the maxi-
mum number of diamonds, stars, or other rating symbols available.
One such resort in my area of northern Virginia offers swimming,
Part III: Caring for Your Beagle 
188

spa services such as massage, agility training, and a cyber-cam so
you can watch your dog if you have Internet access at your vacation
destination. The huge plus to this alternative is that your Beagle will
enjoy his vacation as much as you enjoy your trip, if not more. The
equally big disadvantage is that you may pay more for your dog’s
vacation than you will for your own.
In between these two extremes, of course, are facilities that con-
tain some luxuries, but not a lot, and are moderate in price.
Depending on your budget and other preferences, you can start
your search for a kennel by asking your vet whether his clinic
boards dogs. Another option is to log onto the Web site of the
American Boarding Kennels Association at www.abka.com. There
you’ll find a searchable database that will locate kennels near you.
Be sure to pay a visit to the kennel — preferably unannounced —
before you agree to board your Beagle there. Leave your Beagle
home so you can concentrate on checking for the following:
 Cleanliness: The facility should be clean, with little or no
odor. Doggy accidents should not be in evidence.
 Security: The facility should be escape-proof. Make sure that
the outdoor areas have high fences around them and that the
staff keeps the dogs on leash in any public areas, such as the
reception area.
 Attentiveness: Those who interact with your dog should love
your dog, or show a liking for the canine species in general.
 24/7 presence: If possible, board your dog at a facility that is
staffed by people around the clock.
More information on finding and checking out a kennel is available
from the American Boarding Kennel Association Web site.

W
ho can help falling in love with a Beagle? Certainly not you.
Your sweet Snoopy-dog’s winsome eyes, long floppy ears,
and soft expression had you smitten the moment you first saw her.
When you brought her home, you were sure that your love for her
would only grow and that nothing, absolutely nothing, could get in
the way of that love.
Then she took a whiz in the middle of your white Berber carpet,
which is now graced with a big yellow stain. Understandably, you
are not happy. After a few more similar doggy downloads, you may
not be thinking of your Beagle with a great deal of love. Instead,
you may be wondering whether your little hound is anything more
than a four-legged pooping and peeing machine.
I’m here to assure you that she’s not. Your Beagle is still the same
lovable creature that you believed her to be a couple of days or
weeks ago. However, the fact that she’s adorable doesn’t give her
the knowledge of where and when you want her to do her business.
You must give her that knowledge through the process that’s known
as housetraining.
Simply put, housetraining is the procedure you employ to teach
your Beagle exactly where and when you want her to poop and
pee. When your dog is truly housetrained, she will do just about
anything to avoid making a bathroom boo-boo. Impossible, you
say? Au contraire! This chapter shows you how to teach your
Beagle impeccable bathroom manners.

Going Indoors or Out?
Before you begin to teach proper potty protocol to your Beagle,
you need to make a very important decision: whether that potty
will be located indoors or outdoors.
The ideal indoor potty operates the same way a kitty bathroom
does: You place several layers of newspaper or an open box of
specially prepared dog litter in a laundry room, seldom-used human
bathroom, or anyplace else that’s away from the main living areas of
your home. The ideal outdoor potty is located somewhere in your
backyard or elsewhere in the outdoors, so your home’s interior isn’t
exposed to dog waste after the dog is housetrained.
Each method has advantages and disadvantages. In the next sec-
tions, I outline the pro’s and con’s of each.
Indoor potty pro’s and con’s
Indoor training can be ideal for the owner who’s away from home
all day. Instead of having to wait until her person comes home, the
dog can take herself to her newspapers or litter box and relieve
herself there. With either a litter box or papers, indoor training
helps ensure that the returning owner isn’t greeted by a puddle or
pile deposited in an inappropriate place in the house.
The mobility-impaired owner may find the indoor potty to be
advantageous, too. By keeping the doggy bathroom indoors, the
owner need not walk the dog to a potty outside. The dog can take
care of her bathroom business on her own.
High-rise apartment dwellers with small dogs also may prefer to
train their dogs to do their business inside. Far better to let the
dog do her business in a designated indoor area than to make a
mad dash to the elevator and outdoors to a proper potty spot.
And of course, indoor training seems like a great idea on those
dark and stormy nights when the last thing you want to do is to
take your Beagle out for a bathroom break. The indoor bathroom
allows you both to stay warm and dry whenever your dog needs to
take care of business.
But lest you think that indoor training is a great idea, consider the
disadvantages.
Part IV: Training Your Beagle 
194

The big minus that indoor training carries for the Beagle owner is
that the Beagle’s puddles and deposits may be a little too large,
unwieldy, and gross for the owner to handle inside. That’s because
many Beagles are just a little too large to use the indoor potty —
especially if it’s a litter box. Confining your Beagle’s business to an
indoor location may seem convenient at first, but having to clean
up that business from within your home day in and day out is
likely to get very old very fast. And let’s not forget the smell of
Beagle poop and pee: Both stink and are a major downside to
indoor training.
Outdoor potty pluses and minuses
The outdoor potty is probably better for most Beagles. When you
take your dog outdoors, you don’t have to worry about dealing
with the indoor canine bathroom, or that your dog will outgrow
her litter box or newspapers. In addition, opting for the outdoor
bathroom enables you to multitask: You can exercise your Beagle
outdoors during the same excursion in which you take her to do
her business.
Still not convinced? Choosing to have your dog go outside frees
you from having to keep oodles of newspapers on hand or make
innumerable trips to the store to buy dog litter. And when you
travel, your dog can poop or pee anywhere outdoors; you don’t
need to tote the litter box and dog litter wherever you go.
Of course, snowy days and stormy nights (and vice versa) can
cause the most devoted Beagle owner to question the wisdom of
locating the canine bathroom outdoors — but proper clothing for
you and, perhaps, your Beagle (which you can find at any major
pet supply retailer) can mitigate some of that disadvantage. And if
you work all day, you can’t expect your full-grown, housetrained
dog to hold her water or other stuff for more than eight or nine
hours or so. However, hiring a dog walker or enrolling your Beagle
in doggy day care can forestall accidents that result from your little
hound having to “hold it” for too long.
You gotta choose
If you’ve read the previous two sections and you’re thinking that
I’m solidly aligned with those who housetrain their Beagles out-
doors, you’re right. I think that keeping dog doo outdoors, even
when the weather is less than hospitable to human and canine
exercise, ultimately is more convenient and sanitary under most
circumstances than doing that business indoors.
Chapter 14: Housetraining Your Beagle 195

Still, you may think it would be great to teach your Beagle to potty
outdoors on nice days and spread some newspapers on the ground
so your dog can do her business indoors when the weather isn’t to
your liking. Unfortunately, though, what’s convenient for you will
only confuse your dog — and the result of that confusion will be
decidedly inconvenient. (In other words, you’ll be cleaning up
accidents.)
For these reasons, I strongly suggest that you choose to teach
your Beagle to do her business outdoors. If your heart is set on
having her do the doo inside, though, check out my own book,
Housetraining For Dummies (Wiley), which contains extensive
information on indoor training.
Getting in Gear
You wouldn’t put on a pair of stilettos before running a mile around
the local track, would you? Of course not. Instead, you’d probably
don a pair of sturdy athletic shoes. Your decision would be based
on the understanding that using the right equipment is crucial to
succeeding at whatever you’re trying to do.
That understanding also applies to housetraining. Your Beagle will
learn proper potty protocol much faster if you gather the right
gear together before you try to teach her bathroom basics.
Don’t hate the crate
First, last, and foremost, you need a crate. It doesn’t matter which
kind of crate you use (Chapter 5 outlines your options) — but with-
out a crate, you’ll have a much harder time teaching your Beagle
where and when to potty. But with a crate, housetraining can be
relatively easy. That’s because a crate takes advantage of a basic
canine instinct — a reluctance to dirty the den — and helps your
little hound learn to hold her poop and pee until you can get her to
the designated potty place.
And before you start to fret about what other doggy parents may
think, proper use of the crate is not cruel to the dog. In fact, many
dogs enjoy their crates because they know they can beat a retreat
to their own inner sanctums whenever they feel the need to chill.
My own dog, Allie, is taking her afternoon nap in her open crate
even as I type this housetraining primer. She often chooses to go
into her crate on her own. Your Beagle can learn to do the same.
To understand the role a crate plays in housetraining, see the
“Following Five Steps” section later in this chapter.
Part IV: Training Your Beagle 
196

Keeping things clean
No matter how diligent you are in your housetraining efforts, your
Beagle will make some mistakes during the learning process. Such
mistakes aren’t a big deal, unless you fail to clean up those mis-
takes quickly and completely.
Why is proper cleanup so important? Because the smell of poop or
pee residue is an aromatic come-hither to your Beagle. If you fail to
get rid of the odor as well as the stain from your little hound’s
bathroom transgression, she’ll feel compelled to go right back to
the scene of her earlier crime and become a repeat offender.
However, the right cleanup equipment can help your Beagle make
far fewer mistakes than would otherwise be the case.
To determine whether a cleanup product will do the job, check to
see whether the product contains enzymes. An enzymatic cleaner
not only obliterates any stains that result from doggy bathroom
mishaps, it also eliminates the odors that such mishaps produce.
Examples of such cleaners are Petastic, Nature’s Miracle, Urine Off,
Equalizer, and the oh-so-wonderfully named Anti-Icky-Poo. You can
order the latter from www.AntiIckyPoo.com; the others are avail-
able from pet supply retailers. No matter what you buy, though,
just follow the instructions on the bottle to get the cleanup done.
Don’t use ammonia to clean up your Beagle’s bathroom mistakes.
Ammonia may get rid of the stain, but the smell is almost identical
to the smell of dog pee. That odor will almost certainly prompt
your pooch to return to the scene of his earlier anointing and do
an encore. Ditto for club soda, which also gets rid of the stain but
not the smell.
Chapter 14: Housetraining Your Beagle 197
Let someone else doo it
If you truly can’t stand to pick up your dog’s poop (even after you follow the directions
in Chapter 11), never fear — you can hire someone else to scoop it. In many major
metropolitan areas and their suburbs, companies dedicated to the removal of canine
waste will dispatch technicians to your home on a regular basis to doo their thing.
The costs of these pooper-scooper services vary depending on your local area, the
size of your property, the number of dogs you have, and how often the company visits.
To find a pooper-scooper service in your area, check out the International Directory
of Dog Waste Removal Services at www.pooper-scooper.com/scoopers.htm.

Other helpful items
A few other items that can help you teach bathroom basics to your
Beagle include:
 Paper towels: These not only soak up bathroom boo-boos,
but create a scent cloth that tells your Snoopy-dog exactly
where she should do her business.
 Lots of plastic bags: Cleaning up after your dog makes a
deposit is a basic component of responsible dog ownership.
 A urine detector: If your Beagle keeps anointing the same
spot in your home, even though you think you’ve cleaned it
up, plunking down $20 or so for a urine detector can be a
worthwhile investment. Among the products available are
Simple Solution’s Spot Spotter, which uses ultraviolet light to
reveal urine spots that you can’t see.
What you absolutely don’t need
Pet supply companies offer a plethora of products designed to aid
the housetraining process. In reality, though, a lot of these products
really aren’t necessary. Some of the stuff you don’t need includes
 A housebreaking aid: This is a fancy name for a bottle of drops
that show your Beagle where to do the doo. A scent cloth is a
heck of a lot cheaper (see the “Step 2: Pick a potty place” sec-
tion later in this chapter for more about scent cloths).
 A pooper-scooper: You really don’t need this item. It’s
unwieldy and tough to use precisely. Why bother? Use plastic
bags instead (Chapter 11 tells you how).
 Training pads: These are designed for indoor training, which
generally isn’t a good housetraining option for a Beagle. And
even if you do decide to go the indoor route, using newspa-
pers is cheaper and using dog litter is neater.
 Doggy diapers: Diapers can help an incontinent dog, but they
do nothing to help your Beagle learn her bathroom basics.
Following Five Steps
To housetrain your Beagle, you need to take advantage of her
desire to have her own den; her equally strong desire to refrain
from dirtying that den; and her awesome sense of smell. The task
is easy when you break it down into five steps.
Part IV: Training Your Beagle 
198

Step 1: Create the den
Before you do anything else, get a properly sized crate and make
sure your Beagle is accustomed to it. Chapter 5 gives you the low-
down on how to buy a proper crate; Chapter 6 tells you all you need
to know about introducing the crate to your four-legged friend.
The benefit of using a crate in housetraining is that your Beagle
will do everything she can to avoid dirtying her den, which is how
she views the crate. She’ll hold her poo and pee, just waiting for
the instant that you open up her crate and usher her to the spot
where she can relieve herself. See “Step 4: Follow a schedule” for a
timeline of when to put your dog in her crate and how long she can
wait for the next potty break.
Step 2: Pick a potty place
Find a spot in your backyard or elsewhere on your property where
you can take your Beagle whenever she needs a bathroom break.
Then, show your dog where she should do the doo by creating a
scent cloth and place that cloth on the designated potty place
when you take her out for a pit stop.
As Chapter 6 explains, a scent cloth is a piece of cloth or paper
towel that you use to wipe your Beagle’s urinary area immediately
after she’s peed. Because dogs are drawn to the smell of their
own urine, any place you put that cloth will lure your Beagle
there, at which point she will almost certainly proceed to open
her floodgates.
Step 3: Be vigilant
Yes, your Beagle will mess up (literally) during the housetraining
process, but your objective is to keep those mess-ups to a minimum.
The only way to achieve that objective is to watch your Beagle like a
hawk — in other words, do not take your eyes off her — when she is
out of her crate. If you can’t watch her that carefully, put her back
into the crate until you can.
Why such vigilance? Because you want to make sure that if she
shows signs of needing to go, you can whisk her outdoors to the
potty spot to unload.
Chapter 14: Housetraining Your Beagle 199

Common signs of needing to use the little Beagle’s room are:
 Pacing back and forth
 Trotting around in circles
 Suddenly sniffing the ground intently
 Suddenly stopping whatever she’s been doing
If your dog performs any of those maneuvers, get her to her potty
spot pronto — and praise her lavishly when she poops or pees
there.
If she starts to unload while she’s still in the house, distract her.
Try saying “No!” in a loud voice. The sound may startle her and
cause her to stop her bathroom operation. That’s your cue; scoop
her up and get her out to the potty spot immediately. If she com-
pletes her offload there, praise her to the skies for doing a good
potty and tell her what a good girl she is.
Step 4: Follow a schedule
The whole housetraining process goes a lot easier when you and
your Beagle follow a schedule. That’s because dogs thrive on pre-
dictability — and when you create a potty schedule for your little
friend, she’ll learn to expect a bathroom break and hold it the rest
of the time.
The number of potty breaks you take depends on your dog’s age
and degree of housetraining prowess. A very young puppy may
need to go out hourly. A slightly older pup needs bathroom breaks
when she first wakes up, after every meal, after every playtime,
after every nap, and just before bedtime. A housetrained adult gen-
erally needs no more than three or four breaks each day.

Chapter 14: Housetraining Your Beagle 201

For an adult Beagle, you can skip the midmorning break, the
midday meal, and the midafternoon break. Then you do what’s left:
the 7:00 a.m., 7:30 a.m., noon (minus the meal), 5:30 p.m., 7:00 p.m.
and before-bed breaks.
The housetraining schedule for a 3-month-old puppy or even for an
adult Beagle assumes that someone will be home during the day to
provide the frequent potty breaks the canine housetrainee needs.
If you’re not home during the day, though, you need to provide
alternative arrangements.
If your Beagle is less than 4 or 5 months of age, you’ll need to do
one of two things: arrange for someone to come to your home
during the day to take your little one out, or temporarily allow her
to potty on newspapers during the day. If you choose to allow your
Beagle to use newspapers in the early stages of housetraining, you
train her to go indoors, all the while keeping an eye on the calendar.
Start by spreading out several thicknesses of newspapers in a
corner of your kitchen or laundry room. Place a scent cloth on the
papers so your puppy knows that’s where she’s supposed to potty.
Then, start counting the days until she’s 6 months old. At that
point — or when you come home to dry newspapers for at least a
week, you can switch to the outdoor potty.
Keep your puppy in the room where her newspapers are while
you’re out, and make sure that the room is enclosed by a door or
baby gate so she can’t wander elsewhere in the house.
For the adult housetrainee, have her stay in her crate during the
morning, and have someone come to your home at noon to give
her a potty break and some playtime. She should then stay in her
crate until you come home. And until your dog is completely
housetrained, don’t work late or go out for some after-work drinks
with your colleagues. Your Beagle needs you to come home and
give her that potty break!
Step 5: Be patient
Time’s on your side when you housetrain your Beagle, but you still
need to be patient. You’re asking her to learn something that’s not
easy to learn: to not poop or pee except when she knows she’s
allowed to. A healthy dose of patience, humane use of the crate,
constant vigilance, and a consistent schedule will all help your
Beagle become a housetraining ace.
How do you know when your dog is fully housetrained? Check out
the “Declaring Victory” section later in this chapter.
Part IV: Training Your Beagle 
202

Addressing Accidents
No matter how hard you try, your Beagle housetrainee will have at
least a couple of accidents while you’re teaching her basic potty pro-
tocol. Those accidents won’t necessarily be a bad thing, though — if
you use those occasions to show your Beagle what not to do and to
improve your skills as a bathroom manners instructor.
Catch her in the act
You may have the good luck to catch your Beagle in the middle of a
bathroom transgression. If you see your dog start to squat, distract
her any way you can. A loud “No!” or clap of the hands are just two
ways to interrupt the offload. After you’ve got her attention, pick
her up and get her to the potty spot as fast as you can. If she com-
pletes the offload there, praise her for going in the right place —
and vow to keep a closer eye on her next time so you’ll get her out-
side before she starts her potty maneuvers.
Clean up without comment
You’ve just come home to find a puddle or pile in your hallway.
Then you see your Beagle: ears back, tail between her legs, looking
away from you. You think, “She knows what she did, and now she
feels guilty.” But you’re wrong.
Beagles, like all dogs, have short memories. She has no idea that
you are unhappy about the little present she left you; she doesn’t
even remember creating it. What she does see is your tension and
your expression and she hears your loud voice. She knows you’re
angry. She’s nervous, even scared — but she feels no guilt at all.
The lesson here: Don’t scold your dog or otherwise attempt to dis-
cipline her for having made a bathroom mistake. If you come upon
the mistake, you’re too late to do anything other than clean it up.
Do just that: Lay on the enzymatic cleaner and say nothing to your
Beagle. Your bad temper will only frighten her, and a frightened
student isn’t likely to learn as much as a student who likes her
teacher. Plus, you’re getting angry at the wrong individual: If your
Beagle has an accident, it’s your fault, not hers.
Troubleshoot the accident
Your Beagle’s misplaced puddle or pile should prompt you to
conduct a thorough investigation at the scene of the “crime” to
figure out why that “crime” occurred — and how you can prevent
Chapter 14: Housetraining Your Beagle 203

a recurrence. But you need not be a work-obsessed criminologist
like William Petersen’s character on CSI to conduct an effective
housetraining crime scene investigation. Just examine what you
were doing when your Beagle goofed. Here are some housetraining
boo-boos, and possible explanations as to why they occurred:
 Did she pee when your back was turned? Never let her out
of her crate unless you can watch her every second.
 Did she eliminate in her crate? Make sure that your puppy’s
crate is just large enough for her to stand, turn around, and
lie down comfortably. And don’t leave your housetrainee for
more than two or three hours if she’s a young puppy, and no
more than four hours if she’s an older pup or young adult.
 Did she pee or poop without warning? Start watching your
puppy to see what she does just before she unloads. You’ll
probably see that she does the same thing almost every time
she does the doo (see the “Step 3: Be vigilant” section earlier
in this chapter for a list of behaviors your Beagle is likely to
perform when she needs to go). If she behaves that way in the
house, that’s your cue to get her out to her potty spot — fast.
 Does she have an accident on the same place every day? If
so, you need to do a better clean-up job. Use a cleaner formu-
lated especially for pet stains. See the “Keeping things clean”
section earlier in this chapter for more details.
Declaring Victory
Housetraining a Beagle can seem like a tedious process. You may
wish you could bag the whole business of schedules, cleanups, and
vigilance. You’ll wonder when you can consider your Snoopy-dog
fully housetrained. Here’s how to know when your little hound has
mastered Housetraining 101:
 She’s at least 6 months old. I don’t care how much of a house-
training prodigy you consider your Beagle to be — the fact is,
most dogs can’t hold their poop or pee for an appreciable
length of time until they reach this milestone.
 She hasn’t goofed for at least a month. If your Beagle hasn’t
made a bathroom boo-boo for a month or more, you can be
pretty sure she’s got the housetraining thing down pat.
 She asks to go out. If your dog finds a way to tell you that she
needs to do the doo (for example, going to the door and whin-
ing, tapping her leash with her nose), consider yourself to be a
successful housetrainer. (If you want to teach your dog to tell
you that she needs to go, see the “You can ring my bell . . .”
sidebar.)
Part IV: Training Your Beagle 
204

Addressing Bathroom Issues
Some dogs ace their housetraining lessons, only to develop prob-
lems later. Often, such issues have nothing to do with housetrain-
ing, but reflect another problem. Here are some examples.
She pees on her back
The Beagle who rolls over onto her back and dribbles some urine
when you approach doesn’t have a housetraining problem.
Instead, she’s telling you that you’re the most wonderful being on
earth. This behavior is submissive urination, and it’s easy to fix.
Chapter 14: Housetraining Your Beagle 205
You can ring my bell . . .
Wouldn’t it be wonderful if your Beagle could tell you when she needs to go potty?
Guess what: She can! Some dogs figure this out on their own — I once had a dog
who would tap his leash with his nose and stare at me when he needed a bathroom
break. But if your Beagle isn’t telling you when she needs to go out, you can teach
her how. Here’s what to do:
1. Get something she can communicate with.
Find something that you can hang from a doorknob and that your Snoopy-dog
can reach with her paws or nose. A good choice would be a set of Christmas
bells, because they make a pleasant noise with just a slight touch.
2. Show her what to do.
Each time you take your dog out for a potty break, ring the bells. That way, she’ll
associate the ringing bells with going out to do her business.
3. Let her try.
Sooner or later, your Beagle will want to investigate the bells herself. Encourage
her to do just that: If she even sniffs the bells, praise her lavishly and give her a
treat.
4. Heed her call.
The first time your dog actually taps the bells with her nose, paws at them, or
otherwise causes them to ring, respond immediately: Take her out to her potty
spot. If she goes, praise her lavishly — and pat yourself on the back for teach-
ing her how to communicate with you.

Start by ignoring your deferential doggy when you enter a room.
After a few minutes, get down to her level by squatting or sitting on
the floor. And don’t look directly at her, because she may feel
intimidated by a direct stare, and she’ll piddle some more. Finally,
speak to her softly. Don’t hug or kiss her, because she’ll get excited
and pee.
By making yourself less intimidating to your Beagle, she’ll become
more confident and the behavior will stop.
He christens everything
If your male Beagle is lifting his leg and spraying vertical objects,
he doesn’t have housetraining problems. He’s got turf issues. Dogs
of both genders use their urine to mark their territory, but the
problem is more prevalent among males than females.
The best way to end a dog’s attempts at marksmanship is to neuter
him. A neutered male is much less turf-conscious than his intact
counterpart. Expect to do some follow-up housetraining after the
neutering, though, just to make sure he breaks his bad habit.
Make sure, too, that you clean up any canine christening thor-
oughly with an enzymatic cleaner. Failure to clean up completely
will bring your dog back for encores. 
She strains to pee
The dog who tries to pee, only to produce a wee bit of wee-wee,
may have stones in her urinary tract. Take her to your vet pronto.
Untreated urinary stones can be fatal.
She pees all the time
The housetrained dog who suddenly starts peeing all the time in
all the wrong places probably doesn’t have housetraining amnesia.
Instead, she may have a urinary tract infection or other medical
condition. Get her to her vet as soon as possible. The vet may do
urine tests, blood work, and/or X-rays to determine the cause and
appropriate treatment. Regardless of the cause, it’s a good idea to
take your Beagle out as often as she needs to go, and encourage
her to drink lots of water so she can flush out her system.

Schooling Your Beagle
In This Chapter
 Understanding how Beagles learn
 Taking a positive approach to training
 Choosing training equipment
 Teaching Beagle basics
 Finding an obedience class
A
n educated Beagle — that is, a Beagle who’s had some basic
training — is almost always happier than a Beagle who’s not
had the benefit of such schooling. Why? Because when the edu-
cated Beagle knows and uses that training, the humans in his
household are happy with him. And when the humans are happy,
the Beagle is happy!
Conversely, when the humans are unhappy because the Beagle
isn’t educated, the Beagle almost always is the one who suffers.
That’s because behavioral problems are the overwhelming reason
that people surrender their dogs to animal shelters. The dog who
is destructive, hyperactive, or fails to master bathroom basics can
drive his people to distraction. No one wants to live with a Beagle
who makes life tougher rather than easier — and all too often, the
people beset with such Beagles choose to get rid of those dogs.
Thus, taking the time to teach your little hound some basic man-
ners is really an investment in your future with him. And yes, you
can train him yourself; this chapter explains how. If you’d rather
have someone help you out, though, I also explain how to choose
an obedience class for yourself and your Beagle. If you need to
address behaviors that put a damper on your relationship with
your Beagle, such as biting, barking, or shyness, go directly to
Chapter 16.

Decoding Your Beagle’s SOP
Before you can teach your Beagle anything effectively, you need to
understand how he learns — in other words, you need to decode
his standard operating procedure, or SOP for short. Knowing how
your dog’s mind works and how he views his world gives you a leg
up, so to speak, on teaching him what he needs to know to live
happily ever after with you. Here are some basic principles to keep
in mind as you contemplate schooling your Snoopy-dog.
He lives by his nose
Your Beagle’s number-one tool for learning about the world is his
nose, which is far more sensitive than yours.
The Snoopy-dog sniffer differs from your schnoz in many ways,
meaning that your Beagle not only can detect scents that you
can’t, but also any odor is far more intense to your dog than to
you. Check out these facts:
 The Beagle nose has more than 200 million scent receptors —
cells designed specifically to detect scents — while you’ve got
only around 5 million.
 Even better is the fact that the moisture on your little hound’s
nose enables him to collect large numbers of scent molecules
that together heighten the smell of whatever he’s sniffing.
 Even the Beagle brain is superior to the human brain — at
least when it comes to smells. The area of your Beagle’s brain
that identifies scents is far larger than the corresponding area
in your noggin.
We humans benefit greatly from the superior canine nose. We
employ dogs to sniff out bombs, contraband, disaster victims, and
termites (see Chapter 19). Some especially talented dogs detect
cancerous moles and alert people to imminent epileptic seizures.
But the same nose that can lead a dog to great accomplishments
can also literally lead that dog astray — especially if that dog is a
Beagle. The Beagle is more likely than many other breeds to follow
his nose wherever it takes him, regardless of how much he loves
you and how much danger he puts himself in.
Part IV: Training Your Beagle 
208

He never feels guilty
The Beagle has mastered the art of looking woebegone, but woe to
the human who thinks that those soulful looks reflect canine guilt.
Your little hound doesn’t connect any of your expressions of dis-
pleasure with any mistakes he’s made — and if he can’t make the
connection, he’s not going to feel guilty.
That’s why scolding your Beagle for something he did awhile ago
does nothing to change his behavior. Better to catch him doing
something right and reward him for doing so in a way that allows
him to connect the reward for performing the behavior.
He loves you, but . . .
Beagles, like all dogs, are social creatures, and love to be with their
people. Your pooch is a pack animal who’s hard-wired to look for
canine or other company. Because you are his companion, not to
mention the source of his food, shelter, and safety, he’s predisposed
to love you. He’s happy to bestow doggy kisses on you and cuddle
up for some couch-potato time while you both watch TV. And
when he’s unsure of something, he looks to you for guidance
and direction.
But, as much as he loves you, your dog’s got his own agenda. His
love for you may not be enough to overcome his need to investi-
gate that interesting smell in the yard next door. His desire to
please you may not keep him from raiding the garbage can and
scattering the contents all over the floor. His realization that you
aren’t pleased with what he’s doing won’t prompt him to drop
whatever he’s confiscated from the clothes hamper.
You’re an important priority in your Beagle’s life, but he’s got other
priorities, too. Your job as a trainer is to teach him that you need
to be his number-one priority as often as possible.
He needs consistency
Dogs are incredibly astute observers of behavior. For example, my
own dog suspects that I’m about to leave the house whenever she
sees me put on lipstick. When Allie sees me open up a lipstick tube
and apply the stuff to my lips, she starts to pant happily and lead
me toward her leash. She’s surmised that I’m going to leave the
house, and she wants to make sure that she comes along (alas,
sometimes her efforts are for naught).
Chapter 15: Schooling Your Beagle 209

How does Allie know what I’m going to do before I actually do it?
Simple: I have a consistent routine, and that consistency enables
my four-legged friend to anticipate my behavior.
Your Beagle thrives on consistency just as much as my dog does.
Doing the same thing at the same time each day helps him to pre-
dict what happens next and to adjust his behavior accordingly.
Moreover, such consistency will help him to learn the specific
cues, commands, and maneuvers that you want him to learn. By
using the same words and gestures to convey what you want him
to do, your Beagle will learn to associate those words and gestures
with a specific behavior — and, given the proper incentive, per-
form that behavior accordingly.
He wants to learn
A healthy Beagle is curious about the world around him. His inter-
est in the world leads him to investigate the strange new scent in
the next-door neighbor’s yard, or check out that item of clothing
that didn’t quite make it to the laundry room. That same curiosity
prompts him to study you closely for patterns in your behavior.
You can put this eagerness to work by training your little hound.
Teaching him to respond to your cue or command gives him a job
to do, helps him exercise his brain, and endears him to you (and
vice versa).
Gearing Up for Training
Taking a positive approach to schooling your Beagle requires that
you invest in a little bit of equipment — some of which you proba-
bly have already.
Accentuating the positive
with the right reward
Once upon a time, not all that long ago, dog training was all about
making the dog do what you wanted him to do. If he didn’t comply
voluntarily with your command, you’d force him to do so. A failure
to sit would mean you’d push his tush to the ground. A failure to
walk nicely on leash would mean that you’d yank him back to posi-
tion. A failure to come when called would mean you’d go to him,
grab him by the collar, and drag him back to the spot he was sup-
posed to come to on his own.

Not a very pleasant way to try to learn something, is it?
Fortunately, some empathetic and forward-thinking trainers real-
ized that teaching through coercion or intimidation creates a less-
than-ideal learning atmosphere. Correcting a dog for doing
something wrong doesn’t necessarily teach him to do something
right. A better approach is to show the dog what you want him to
do (or catch him doing so on his own) and then reward that behav-
ior. Applied consistently, this approach, which trainers call positive
reinforcement, will up the odds that your Beagle will do what you
want him to do every time you want him to do it.
When you employ positive reinforcement to train your Beagle, you
condition him to do what you want him to do. Just show him what
you want him to do, and reward him for doing so.
Your Beagle loves you — but when it comes to training, love may
not be enough to motivate your little companion to do what you
want him to do. An incredibly fragrant, tasty treat can fill in the gap
between your dog’s desire to please you and his desire to do what
he wants instead of what you want.

Hamming it up
I’m way, way past high school age, but a couple of months ago, I found myself par-
ticipating in a high school musical. My teenage daughter was a stage manager for
a show called Carnival, an extravaganza that required the presence of a small dog
in the opening scene. The person who was handling the dog for this show — a
sweet little Beagle mix — broke her toe just four days before the show was to open,
so I was asked to step in. My task: to dress up in a clown suit (hold the snickering,
please), bring the dog up on the stage, and then walk with the dog offstage. The
catch: The dog had to walk on his hind legs.
The dog’s handler supplied me with dog treats to give the little guy an incentive to
do the walking-on-hind legs maneuver. But the dog didn’t seem to enjoy those little
goodies, and he refused to perform as desired. Then I noticed that he was extremely
interested in the backstage buffet table for the human actors, which was laden with
ham, cheese, turkey, and other delectables. In a fit of inspiration, I pocketed a few
pieces of ham. At the appropriate moment onstage, I held the ham aloft, just out of
the dog’s easy reach, and began walking. In a flash, the little dog was up on his hind
legs, practically prancing his way offstage. Thunderous applause erupted, and the
dog got the pieces of ham.
My point? The right reward can be incredibly persuasive. So don’t get just any treat —
find a goody that your Beagle really, really likes.

You’ll probably find that your Beagle prefers soft, meaty tidbits to
hard little pieces of kibble-like dog treats. Most dogs also adore hot
dogs (cut up into very tiny pieces, please).
Collar quandaries
Making the right collar choice is crucial to training your Beagle
successfully. To keep your training positive, opt for either a buckle
collar or a tab-snap collar (see Figure 15-1) made of leather, cotton,
or nylon. The collar should be nothing more than a piece of neck-
wear that holds your dog’s identification tag, rabies tag, local
license, microchip identification number, and leash.
Steer clear of collars that purport to be training devices in and of
themselves. Such collars include:
 Slip collars: Also known as training collars or choke collars,
slip collars were once the canine neckwear of choice for pro-
fessional dog trainers and their human students. A handler
uses this metal collar to correct the dog’s behavior by giving
the leash a quick snap and a release immediately afterward.
This snap-and-release action puts momentary pressure on a
dog’s neck, which hypothetically creates an incentive for the
Part IV: Training Your Beagle 
212
Click, click, click: Clicker training
Many trainers advocate the use of a clicker: a handy little gizmo that makes a “click-
ing” sound when pressed. The clicker provides an instant signal to your Beagle that
he’s done something right, and that a reward will soon follow. Experts say that
clicker-trained dogs learn new maneuvers faster than those who get simple praise
to confirm that they’ve done what they’re supposed to.
I’ve found clickers to be very effective in speeding up a dog’s learning process.
However, some individuals find the clicker to be a little cumbersome. It’s one more
thing they have to handle when they’re also trying to juggle treats and, at times, the
dog’s leash. Timing is crucial, too: You need to use the clicker immediately after the
dog complies with the command. That said, many trainers and students contend
that once you start clicking your way to training success, you’ll never go back. Give
it a try, and you may find that your Snoopy-dog becomes a quicker study than you
dreamed possible.
If you want to learn more about clicker training, check out Click & Easy: Clicker
Training for Dogs, by Miriam Fields-Babineau (Wiley).

dog to cease his bad behavior. Moreover, the jingling sound of
the collar is supposed to warn the dog to cease whatever he’s
doing.
In real life, though, slip collars aren’t effective for many
people, and can actually hurt the dog. If a person doesn’t
perform the snap-and-release action correctly, she can
damage her dog’s windpipe at worst, and leave him gasping
for breath at best. Meanwhile, the problem behavior is all
too likely to continue.
 Prong collars: This neck gear is exactly what the name says it
is: a collar with prongs on it that the dog will feel if the owner
needs to pull on the leash. Prong collars hurt, and they’re
cruel. You don’t need to inflict pain or be cruel to teach your
dog proper walking etiquette, bathroom manners, or anything
else. Any questions?
 Electronic collars: Please. Do you really need to give your
Beagle an electric shock to get him to do what you want him
to do? That’s what an electronic collar does. Causing pain or
discomfort should not be part of any trainer’s operating pro-
cedure, standard or otherwise.
Figure 15-1: Choose a buckle or snap collar for your Beagle.
Leash options
As I explain in Chapter 5, a 6-foot leather leash is the best option I
know for keeping your Beagle tethered to you in comfort and
safety. Longer leashes — including retractables — are difficult to
handle and may violate local laws. Shorter leashes aren’t practical
for training.
My preference for leather has nothing to do with fashion but every-
thing to do with comfort — your comfort. If your leashed Beagle
pulls, the movement of leather across your hand is a lot less painful
than the movement of nylon, which can give you a nasty scrape.
Chapter 15: Schooling Your Beagle 213

Teaching the Basics Yourself
The right equipment is crucial to teaching your Beagle basic good
manners, but you also need the right atmosphere. At least in the
beginning, a good training environment downplays distractions
such as kids running around, TV blaring, or lots of commotion
going on outdoors.
Your actual training sessions also need to be short enough to keep
your dog’s attention and sweet enough to keep him motivated. A
training session should be five minutes — max — for puppies
under 4 months of age, and no more than 10 minutes for older
pups and adults. And to keep the session sweet, always end it on a
positive note: Ask him to do something he already knows how to
do. When he complies, lay on the praise and give him a treat.
And don’t think you can’t teach an old dog new tricks. Any dog can
learn at any age. Older dogs may need a little more time to learn
what you want them to do, but they love the attention — and the
mental exercise of training can keep them healthier!
Here’s how to teach basic commands that every dog should know.
His name
Training begins with teaching your Beagle his name. When your
Beagle knows who he is, you can get his attention much more
easily — and attention is crucial to learning. Follow these instruc-
tions to train your Beagle to recognize his name:
1. Bring your Beagle to a place that’s free from distractions. 
2. Say his name in a cheerful voice.
3. As soon as he looks at you, praise him and give him
a treat.
If he doesn’t respond, don’t repeat his name. Instead,
change course: Eat the treat yourself (make sure it’s some-
thing you both like) or leave the room for a minute or so.
Then try again.
4. Wait until he looks away from you, then repeat Steps 1
through 3.
Part IV: Training Your Beagle 
214

Sit
The Sit command is just about the easiest one that you can teach
your Beagle. Here’s how:
1. Stand in front of your dog, and make sure you have his
attention.
2. Hold a treat between your thumb and forefinger in front
of him and make sure he sees it (see Figure 15-2a).
3. At the same time, say “Sit” and hold the treat just over
his head.
4. With your dog’s eyes on the prize, move the treat back
toward his rear end (see Figure 15-2b).
As your dog follows your hand with his eyes, he’ll automat-
ically sit down.
5. Praise and give the treat when his tush hits the ground.
Figure 15-2: Use your hands, your voice, and treats to teach your Beagle to sit.

Chapter 15: Schooling Your Beagle 215

Down
Teaching the Down command follows the same principle as Sit —
but make sure that your Beagle has mastered Sit before you try
teaching this one. To teach the Down command:
1. Squat, sit, or kneel down so you’re close to his level.
2. Hold a treat in front of his face, and make sure he’s look-
ing at it.
3. Say “Down,” in a long, drawn-out tone so you’re really
saying “Dooowwwwn.”
4. Move the treat down to the ground about 6 inches in
front of your Beagle (see Figure 15-3a).
5. Move the treat outward several more inches, so your
hand is moving in an L-shaped path (see Figure 15-3b).
As the dog follows your hand with her eyes, he’ll lie down.
6. Praise and treat as soon as he’s lying down.
Figure 15-3: Lure your Beagle into a Down position with a treat.

Stay
The Stay command tells your dog to remain where he is. Here’s
how to teach it:
1. Start by placing your dog in a Sit or Down position. 
2. Place your open palm about 6 inches from his nose and
say “Stay,” in a long, drawn-out tone so you’re really
saying “Staaaaaay” (see Figure 15-4).
3. Keeping your palm up, move back one step, then return
immediately.
4. Praise your Beagle for staying, and give him a treat.
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4, moving back two steps this
time.
Gradually increase the distance you move away from your
Beagle, the length of time he must stay, and the distrac-
tions in his environment.
Figure 15-4: Your hand reinforces the Stay command.
Chapter 15: Schooling Your Beagle 217

Recall
The Recall command is probably the most important command
that you can teach a dog — but for a Beagle with wanderlust (in
short, probably 99.9 percent of all Snoopy-dogs), it’s also just
about the toughest. To teach this maneuver, arm yourself with lots
of patience and plenty of treats. Then:
1. Say your dog’s name and “Come” in a happy, enthusiastic
tone of voice.
2. Squat down and open your arms as your dog comes
to you.
3. Welcome him enthusiastically and give him a treat when
he reaches you.
4. Repeat the process, but gradually increase the distance
between you.
Even when your Beagle has mastered this maneuver, keep practic-
ing it — but in a fun setting, such as hiding and calling him to come
find you.
Don’t practice this command outdoors unless your Beagle is on
leash or in a securely fenced area!
Off
The Off command tells your Beagle to reverse course, no matter
what he’s doing. If he’s interested in the chicken bone someone left
on the sidewalk, a sharply spoken “off” will keep him from trying to
eat it; if he’s conducting a panty raid on your lingerie, a crisply
spoken “off” will get him out of the clothes hamper or dresser
drawer. To teach the Off command:
1. Place your Beagle’s favorite toy on the ground a few feet
away from him.
2. When he heads for the toy, pick it up and say “Off!” in a
loud, commanding voice that will startle him.
3. As he looks at you in surprise, praise him in a high,
sweet-sounding voice — and then give him the toy.
4 Repeat Steps 1 through 3 until he instantly drops or
moves away from the toy when he hears the command.
Practice this command often — it’s one that Beagles and other
members of the canine persuasion tend to forget easily.

Walking on leash
Wouldn’t it be nice to take your Beagle for a walk and not feel as
though he’s leading you in his own little reenactment of the
Iditarod? News flash: You can! Just follow this plan:
1. Leash your dog and place the leash loop around your
wrist.
2. Grasp the leash with the looped hand just below the loop,
and hold the leash about halfway down its length with
the opposite hand.
3. Have your Beagle stand next to you on the side opposite
your looped hand so the leash falls diagonally across
your body.
4. Tell him, “Let’s go!” in a cheerful but decisive voice, and
start walking briskly.
5. As you walk, chat with your dog so he pays attention to
you.
6. If he bolts out in front of you, let him go the full length of
the leash, and then turn around suddenly — but without
jerking the leash — and walk in the opposite direction.
Your surprised Beagle will soon learn to pay attention to
you instead of whatever’s causing him to run ahead.
7. When you stop, remove your unlooped hand from the
leash, and place that hand in front of your dog’s face so
he stops, too.
8. Repeat if necessary.
Some notorious pullers acquire better walking manners when you
acquire some new equipment. One option is to use a head collar
instead of a regular collar. This device looks like a muzzle but works
the same way a bridle on a horse does. If your Beagle lunges ahead
while he’s wearing this device, his head will be forced downward —
not painfully, but enough to surprise him. Another option is a spe-
cial harness that fastens at the breastbone to prevent pulling. Both
are available at pet specialty stores.
Go to your place
As much as you love your Beagle, sometimes you won’t want
him underfoot. At such times, being able to tell him to go to a
designated spot comes in very handy. Here’s how to teach this
maneuver:
Chapter 15: Schooling Your Beagle 219

1. Choose a spot, such as his crate or a floor cushion in a
corner of your living room, to which your dog can retreat
and see all the household action.
2. Attach his leash, tell him “Place,” and lead him to the
designated spot.
3. Praise and give a treat.
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 until your Beagle goes to his
place on command.
Enrolling Your Beagle 
in Obedience Class
Although you can teach your Beagle basic good manners all by
yourself, taking him to an obedience class is still a good idea. Such
classes offer your little hound the chance to hang out with others
of his kind, and to practice his obedience maneuvers amid more
distractions. A class also allows you to compare notes with other
owners and get expert help to improve your training techniques.
That said, all obedience classes are not created equal. Some are
staffed by competent individuals who have made it their business
to become experts on canine behavior and learning, and who make
sure they keep abreast of research on dog training. Others, alas,
may not have taken any training beyond what their one-gimmick
franchise offers. Your job: Differentiate between the first type of
trainer and the second, and make sure that you take your Beagle
to the first.
Start by talking with your veterinarian and with owners of well-
behaved dogs you know. Ask them where to find competent train-
ers in your area.
Another route to take is through cyberspace. Log onto the Web site
of a training organization, such as the Association of Pet Dog
Trainers at www.apdt.com. There you can search a database to
find a trainer near you.
Look for trainers who have the initials CPDT after their names.
This acronym stands for Certified Pet Dog Trainer and means that
the trainer has studied for and passed a rigorous examination on
positive reinforcement training.
Part IV: Training Your Beagle 
220

After you’ve identified one or more trainers, ask them some ques-
tions. Here’s what you need to know:
 What is your training philosophy? Most trainers are smart
enough to answer “positive reinforcement” — but you need
more specific information than a canned response offers. Find
out how the trainer would apply that philosophy in specific
situations, such as managing a dog who jumps on people.
Some trainers use their knees or the leash to correct the dog’s
jumping; others try to divert the dog away from jumping to
another, more appropriate attention-seeking action. You want
a trainer who employs the latter approach.
 What equipment do you use? This question sheds more light
on a trainer’s methods. If the trainer uses slip chains, prong
collars, electronic devices, or anything else that causes dis-
comfort to the animal, walk away. Pain is not necessary to
train a dog.
 May I observe a class? By watching a trainer in action, you
can not only see for yourself whether he works the way he
says he does, but also determine whether you and your
Beagle would be comfortable working with him. Watch how
the trainer interacts with both people and dogs, and see
whether the class is too crowded (an ideal ratio is one
instructor for every six dogs; a 1-to-8 ratio should be the
max). Note, too, how the trainer explains and demonstrates
concepts, answers owners’ questions, and handles disruptive
dogs. Finally, see whether the human and canine students
appear to be having fun while they’re learning.
 Do you have references? Any trainer can create a gorgeous
brochure or hire a designer to build a great Web site — but
neither of these marketing vehicles gives you the info you
need to evaluate the trainer. That’s why you should ask for
references from clients and veterinarians — and why you
should call at least a couple of them. Ask them what they
think of the trainer, whether they found her classes effective,
and how she deals with dogs who have trouble catching on.
 Do you offer both private and group classes? A trainer who
offers both group classes and private instruction may be more
versatile and flexible than a trainer who offers only group
instruction. Trainers who offer both types of instruction are
more likely to adapt their programs to each individual dog,
and are better able to help you deal with any problems that
your Beagle may have.

 Dealing with behavioral problems
 Finding expert help
E
very Beagle needs basic training (see Chapter 15), but some
Beagles need more than the basics. These little hounds need
special help to overcome special issues that trouble them — and
probably trouble you, too. But you don’t have to live with your
Beagle’s behavioral problems. This chapter helps you to deal with
the problems that most often get in the way of your Beagle getting
a good-conduct medal. If you can’t solve the problem yourself, the
chapter explains how to find an expert who can help you.
Solving Common Snoopy-dog
Problems
No dog, not even your beloved Beagle, is perfect. Every little
hound (heck, every member of the canine kingdom) presents her
own unique set of pluses and minuses: areas where she excels and
areas where she needs a little extra help. Here are some ideas on
how to deal with some of the behavioral challenges that your
pooch is most likely to present.
Huh? You talkin’ to me?
No, I’m not saying that your Beagle is likely to imitate Robert De
Niro’s character in the classic film Taxi Driver. Unlike the melan-
choly Travis Bickle, the Beagle is a merry little dog who is tremen-
dously curious about the world around her. She loves investigating

new smells and sights, and is a master at living in the moment. We
humans could all stand to learn from the Beagle’s ability to
embrace the present.
However, that ability does have a downside: Your little hound may
be so interested in whatever she’s doing at the moment that she
fails to focus on you. Such inattention could pose a real challenge if
you’re trying to train her or otherwise need for her to focus on you.
The solution is to become so interesting to your Beagle that she
will want to focus on you before she pays attention to anything
else. The following tips will help you achieve that goal:
 Bribe shamelessly. The way to a Beagle’s heart often passes
through her stomach, so use that route to your advantage.
Figure out which foods or treats your Snoopy-dog loves more
than any others, and offer those tidbits as incentives for her
to do what you ask.
 Stay positive. Never, ever ask your Beagle to do something
that has a negative consequence. For example, don’t ask her
to come, and then scold her for an earlier transgression.
(Think about it: Would you want to go to someone who yells at
you when you get there?)
 Avoid failure. Don’t ask your Beagle to do something she’s
likely to fail at. If, for example, she’s having a great time play-
ing at the dog park but it’s time to go home, don’t expect her
to come when you call her. Go to her.
 Be the shizzle. The best way to get your Beagle to pay atten-
tion to you is to be the shizzle in her life: the most interesting,
fun-loving owner that you can possibly be. Take her with you
on outings, play with her when you can, and give her tasty
treats when appropriate. Let her know that she’s important to
you, and you’ll become important to her.
Putting the (play) bite on you
Dogs tend to play with their teeth. If a dog’s playmate is another
dog, this oral style of frolicking usually doesn’t present a problem.
Because they both have fur that covers their skin, and because well-
socialized dogs inhibit their bites, such oral gestures generally don’t
hurt the two canine players. But if one of the players is a human
being, everything changes. That’s because bare human skin is far
more tender than fur-covered dog skin, so what feels like gentle
mouthing to another dog feels like a painful bite to a thin-skinned
human.
Part IV: Training Your Beagle 
224

But you don’t have to tolerate having your Beagle put the bite on
you, even if she means no harm. Try these strategies to end those
toothy tactics:
 Make like a dog. If your Beagle plays too roughly with another
dog, that dog will let her know by yelping in pain. Try doing the
same thing with your Beagle: If she’s using her teeth on your
skin, yelp or squeal the way a puppy does. Another option: Say
“Ouch!!!” in a harsh-sounding, loud voice. Either way, chances
are your Beagle will look up in surprise — which means that
she’s no longer mouthing you.
 Walk away. Some dogs persist in their play biting. If your
Beagle is one such dog, end the game and walk away (if she’s
a puppy, put her in her crate). The consistent loss of your
company due to nipping may soon persuade her to find other
ways to keep you around for playtime.
 Give alternatives. Help your rowdy little hound find other
ways besides roughhousing with you to release some of the
pent-up energy that can result in rough play. Toss a ball for
her to fetch, do some obedience moves with her, or take her
for a nice, long walk that gets her good and tired. If she’s old
enough, take her to a dog park to play with other pooches.
 Teach her to stop. A variation of the Off command, which I
explain in Chapter 15, can help you teach your Beagle to keep
her teeth off your person. Get out a few tasty treats, and hold
one treat in your hand. Tell your Beagle “take it” and give her
the treat. Now put another treat in your hand, close your fist,
and say “off.” Do this sequence a few times, and practice daily.
Soon, you should be able to tell your Beagle “off” when she
places her teeth on you.
The advice here is for juvenile and adult Beagles who engage in
play-biting. If your Beagle’s biting is not all in fun — in other words,
if she’s being aggressive — you need to read the following section.
Knocking that chip off her shoulder
Most Beagles are happy-go-lucky, all’s-right-with-the-world kinds of
dogs. But some unfortunate pooches, for one reason or another,
have massive chips on their shoulders. They growl or bite people
without apparent provocation — and they’re not playing. They’re
belligerent and aggressive.
A person who lives with such a dog has a big problem, even with
a little dog such as a Beagle. Aggressive dogs are not only danger-
ous to the people they come in contact with but also are financial
Chapter 16: Rehabbing the Delinquent Beagle 225

liabilities — just try getting homeowner’s insurance renewed if your
dog’s been deemed aggressive in a court of law.
Can the aggressive dog be saved? Maybe. If your Beagle is belliger-
ent, follow this advice:
 Protect others. Until or unless you find out what’s causing
your dog’s aggressive behavior and are able to reverse that
behavior, you must protect other people from her. If you walk
with her in public, make sure she wears a muzzle and a leash.
(Don’t walk your muzzled dog in very hot weather, and don’t
run with her at all.) At home, confine her to her crate if you
have guests, especially if those guests are children.
 Protect the dog. All dogs need protection from clueless
humans, but the aggressive dog needs even more safeguard-
ing. Never leave any children alone with the dog. Do not allow
children to tease the dog in any fashion, and teach your own
children to refrain from running around and screaming when
the dog is nearby.
 See your vet pronto. All too often, aggressive behavior has
physical causes. For example, a dog who suffers from a spe-
cific type of epilepsy can suffer from sudden, unpredictable,
and uncontrollable episodes of rage. The same may be true of
a dog whose production of thyroid hormone is low — even on
the low side of normal. Other physical causes of aggression
include pain, trauma, certain infections such as Lyme disease,
food allergies, excessive protein in the diet, and long-term
exposure to toxic substances such as lead. Your vet can help
you determine whether a physical problem is causing your
dog’s behavior problem, and he may be able to prescribe
medication or another treatment to stabilize her behavior.
 Consult a trainer. Even if your dog’s aggressive behavior has
a treatable physical cause, you still need to work with a highly
skilled trainer to help break the animal’s habit of responding
aggressively. And private lessons are essential. An aggressive
dog needs one-on-one assistance from a pro to learn new
behaviors, and that dog’s people need help to learn how to
deal with their canine companion. Make sure, though, that the
trainer uses positive methods; a trainer who uses harsh, cor-
rective methods may worsen your dog’s problem.
 Be realistic. Sometimes, no matter how much you do to help
your aggressive dog, her behavior is not reliable enough for
you and others to live safely with her. In such cases, euthanasia
is a humane option. Talk with your vet and your trainer if your
dog doesn’t seem to be responding. In the end, though, you
must be prepared to do what’s best not only for you and
your dog, but also for those with whom the dog may come
into contact.

Taming the bouncy Beagle
Who would have thought that a 13- to 15-inch dog could jump to
well more than double that height? If you have a Beagle, you know
the answer to that question: The little hound can morph into a
canine pogo stick if the spirit moves her.
Generally, though, the spirit moves the Beagle to become airborne
for one reason: She wants attention. By shooting herself upward
she usually gets that attention, even if it comes in the form of,
“Ouch! What are you doing to my sweater?! Don’t jump on me! Get
down!!” Your bouncy Beagle doesn’t really care that you don’t like
what she’s doing. She just wants a reaction — especially if she
doesn’t get a lot of attention in the first place. Consequently,
yelling at her does nothing to stop her pogo stick behavior.
And yes, you can knee her in the chest, or grab her paws so she
can’t get back on all fours. However, these maneuvers call for
incredibly good physical coordination on your part and, more
importantly, jeopardize your Beagle’s safety. A knee that lands in
the chest too hard or an awkward grab of the paw can result in
bruises, sprains, or even broken bones.
A better way to bring the bouncy Beagle back down to earth is to
simply refuse to pay attention to her behavior. The next time she
performs a doggy liftoff, walk away from her, or at least turn your
back. Say nothing. Pay no attention to her at all until she’s planted
her four legs back on the floor and keeps them there. Then, praise
her, pet her, and give her a treat. Do this consistently whenever
she jumps up on you — and instruct others in your household to
do the same. Pretty soon she’ll realize that the way to get attention
from you is to keep four on the floor.
Loving you waaaay too much
Most Beagles are reasonably independent, but a few fail to function
well without their people. These sad individuals not only hate soli-
tude but often go bonkers if left alone. They may destroy your stuff,
have bathroom accidents, howl, cry, or otherwise wreak havoc
when you’re not around. Experts call this problem separation anxi-
ety, and it can be a tough challenge for Beagle and human alike.
However, tough doesn’t mean insurmountable. If prolonged soli-
tude drives your Beagle crazy, try taking these tactics:
 Wear her out. If possible, take your Beagle for a brisk 20-minute
walk or engage in a strenuous play session with her before you
Chapter 16: Rehabbing the Delinquent Beagle 227

head out the door. Get her panting. A hearty romp may leave
her too tired to miss you (and get upset) after you’re gone.
 Keep her busy. Interactive toys like Kongs and Busta Cubes can
give your little hound something so intriguing to do that she for-
gets to be lonesome. Both toys, which are available at most pet
supply stores and superstores, allow you to stuff treats inside
them and require your Beagle to ferret those treats out. The
reward, of course, is to enjoy the goodies. If you stuff the treats
tightly enough, your Snoopy-dog will have to work very hard to
reap the tasty reward — which means she won’t be missing you.
 Change your routine. Many dogs can anticipate when their
people are about to depart because those people engage in
the same predeparture routines. My own dog appears from
nowhere just as I’m about to leave the house because I always
put on lipstick, put on my shoes, pick up my purse, and get
out my keys. Fortunately, Allie doesn’t suffer from separation
anxiety, but if your dog does, an unchanging departure routine
can heighten that anxiety.
For that reason, you may want to prevent that anxiety-produc-
ing anticipation by varying your departure rituals. Try putting
on your shoes and then going into the living room to read a
book. Pick up your purse and keys, but then head into the
bathroom. By breaking the chain of anxious anticipation, you
can help your Beagle feel less nervous about your impending
departure — simply because she won’t know that you’re
leaving.
 Downplay your departures. Many dogs with separation anxi-
ety have owners who make a big deal out of their departures.
They rain hugs and kisses on their Beagles, who become so
revved up emotionally that they have no way to discharge
those emotions when the owner isn’t there — except to
destroy the owner’s stuff. Instead, be matter-of-fact when you
take your leave. A simple “Bye, I’ll be back soon” or “Be a
good dog and watch the house” will do.
 Crate her. For some (but not all) dogs, spending alone time in
the crate can help her feel better about being all by herself —
especially if she’s got a Kong or Busta Cube to keep her busy.
 Encourage independence. Even when you’re around, give
your dog something to do on her own. That stuffed Kong or
Busta Cube can keep her happy and content.
 Consider day care. If you’ve got the bucks, your Beagle may
be a prime candidate for doggy day care. At good doggy day
cares, the canine guests get to frolic with one another for
most of the day. Your stuff is safe, your Beagle is happy, and
you have a mellow canine companion when you pick her up
and head for home.
Part IV: Training Your Beagle 
228

 Take her with you. Check and see if your workplace allows
you to bring your dog to work. If the answer is yes and your
Beagle is generally well behaved, your problem’s solved.
 See your vet. If you’ve tried most of the other measures and
have had no luck in abating your Beagle’s anxiety, see your
vet. He may be able to prescribe medications that can help
your dog calm down when you depart — and if she’s even just
a little calmer, she can benefit from other steps you take to de-
traumatize your departures.
Helping the bashful Beagle
Does your Beagle run behind your legs whenever you encounter
other people or pooches during your walks? Does she hide in a
corner when you have guests? Does she shrink from being petted?
If you’ve answered “yes” to any of these questions, you’ve got a
bashful Beagle: a shy little gal who needs lots of love and attention
and some help to build her confidence. Here are some ways to do
just that:
 Expose her. Take your bashful Beagle out and about, and let
her see what the world has to offer. Sit on an urban park
bench with her, and together watch the world go by. Watch a
kids’ soccer game. Walk her everywhere: in your neighbor-
hood, the local shopping center, a park. The more novel sights
and sounds you expose her to, the better. Chapter 7 offers lots
of tips for giving your Beagle a positive introduction to the
joys of the world around her.
 Talk to strangers. Bring some treats with you on your jaunts,
and get some approachable strangers to give those goodies to
your shy Snoopy-dog. True story: Years ago I asked a local mail
carrier to give my very shy dog (not a Beagle) some treats that
I supplied to help Cory be less wary of strangers. The mail car-
rier was happy to oblige, and would offer treats to my bashful
boy whenever he saw him. Within a few weeks, Cory would
start dragging me down the street whenever he saw that letter
carrier — and for the rest of his life he would exhibit unmistak-
able excitement whenever he saw a U.S. Postal Service truck.
 Teach her something new. The dog who lacks confidence often
develops amazing self-assurance when she learns a sport or
new skill. Consider taking your dog to an agility or flyball class,
or take her swimming. Teach her some tricks, too: Dog Tricks
For Dummies by Sarah Hodgson (Wiley) will give you some
ideas for nifty new moves that you can teach your Beagle.
 Take it slow. Don’t push your bashful Beagle to do more than
she’s ready for, and keep your socialization sessions short.
Chapter 16: Rehabbing the Delinquent Beagle 229

The key here is to keep everything happy and positive, so
your Beagle can build her confidence at her own pace.
 Don’t coddle. If your dog starts cringing or otherwise exhibits
fear or shyness, do not pick her up and start crooning, “It’s
okay, baaaayyyybeeeee.” By doing so you reward her shy
behavior — exactly what you don’t want to do.

Terrified Dog into a Terrific Pet by Deborah Wood (Howell Book

Shushing the barking Beagle
Beagles can be rather vocal individuals. They like to bark and, in
true hound fashion, they like to howl. Such vocalizing will make
you rather unpopular with your neighbors unless you can keep the
barking to a manageable level, if not a minimum. Here’s how to
limit your hound’s bow-wowing:
 Wear her out. A dog who’s gotten plenty of exercise is less
likely to have the energy to mouth off than the dog who does
nothing but lie around the house.
 Keep her entertained. If your little hound’s concerts start
while you’re away from home, give her something else to do
instead. A treat-filled Kong toy or Busta cube can provide lots
of tasty entertainment for your solitary Snoopy-dog, and she
won’t need to bark to amuse herself.
 Ignore her. Yes, it’s tempting to respond to your loud-mouth
Beagle by getting a little bit loud yourself — but yelling at your
dog to quiet down usually has the opposite effect. Instead,
walk away. Ignore her. Withdraw the attention that she seeks.
 Ask why. Sometimes dogs have a good reason for barking. For
example, an intruder is nearby (the fact that said intruder is a
squirrel scampering across your patio is totally irrelevant to
your Beagle) or something else is amiss. Try to find out why
your Bowser is barking. If the reason is understandable, thank
her, give her a treat — and then give her something else to do.
Keeping the wanderer home
The Beagle is not a natural homebody. Like many hounds, her idea
of heaven on earth is to sniff something intriguing and follow that
scent to its source. If that source is beyond your property line —
well, from your dog’s standpoint, that’s the way it (and she) goes.
Part IV: Training Your Beagle 
230

What’s most important to her is finding the source of that scent.
She spends her life being led around by her nose.
In addition to a consuming interest in fragrant phenomena, the
Beagle also is a fairly independent member of the canine kingdom.
Of course she loves you — but for her, loving you and adhering to
your agenda are not necessarily one and the same. She’s got her
own priorities, and those priorities can easily take her beyond
your borders, unless you prevent her from doing so. Here’s how:
 Fence her in. Either invest in secure fencing for your yard, or
resolve to never, ever let your Beagle off leash unless she’s in
an area that’s surrounded by secure fencing. Actually, do both!
 Check her collar. If your Beagle wears a buckle collar, check
every few weeks to make sure that the hole for the buckle pin
hasn’t gotten so large that the pin comes loose. And no matter
what sort of collar your Beagle wears, check periodically to
make sure that the collar isn’t so loose that your dog can slip
her head through it and head for the hills.
 Practice recalls. Coming when called is particularly difficult
for a Beagle, but practice never hurts. It’s not beyond the
realm of possibility that your command to come would keep
your Beagle from going on the lam. See Chapter 15 for instruc-
tions on how to teach your Beagle to come when she’s called.
Teaching treat-taking manners
Does your Snoopy-dog get a little too snappish when she takes
the treat you offer her? If so, you can teach her better manners.
Here’s how:
1. Hold the treat between your thumb and index finger.
Make sure that the treat is big enough for your Beagle to
grab without also grabbing your fingers.
2. Offer your Beagle the treat, saying “Take it nice” as you
do so.
3. If she snaps or grabs at the treat, pull it back quickly and
tell her “Oh, nooooooo!” in a scandalized, what-are-you-
thinking tone of voice.
4. Wait a couple of seconds, and then repeat Step 2; if she
still snaps, repeat Step 3.
5. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until your Beagle takes the treat
politely.
Chapter 16: Rehabbing the Delinquent Beagle 231

Picking Experts’ Brains
Not every Beagle responds to owner teaching or even to group
obedience classes. If your Beagle is one of those dogs, don’t
despair: Specialized help is available. Here are some options to
help the Beagle with special behavioral challenges.
Getting private lessons
Some dogs don’t do well in group class settings. My own canine
companion is one such animal. In any class I’ve taken her to, Allie
performs beautifully and learns quickly — but she becomes very
impatient with sitting quietly and having to wait her turn to strut
her stuff. Consequently, she becomes very disruptive. She barks
incessantly and tries to play with the other canine students.
Needless to say, neither she nor I have been very popular with the
other students or the instructors in classes we’ve taken.
In such cases — or if you simply can’t mesh your schedule with that
of a class — private instruction from a trainer could be the answer.
A trainer comes to your home, works with you and your dog both
indoors and out, and gives your dog concentrated one-on-one atten-
tion. The dog learns much more quickly than in a group class.
There’s a downside to private lessons, of course: the price. In my
area, a series of six or seven private sessions costs about $500,
where a seven-session group class costs about $175. (I live in an
expensive area; your mileage may vary.) But if your dog isn’t likely
to learn much in a group class, getting private lessons may be a
good investment.
To find a trainer who does private sessions, check out the
Association of Pet Dog Trainers Web site at www.apdt.com. Call a
couple of the trainers you find on the site’s searchable database and
ask if they do private lessons. Have them come meet your dog, ask
the questions suggested in Chapter 15, and take things from there.
Trying day training
Maybe you’re really busy — so busy that you can’t find the time to
take your Beagle to class, schedule private lessons, or even teach
her basic good manners on your own. If that’s your situation, day
training may be just the ticket for you and your little hound.
Essentially, day training means that you take your Beagle to a
doggy day care or training facility and leave her there for the day.
She’ll get plenty of play time with other pooches, but she’ll also get
Part IV: Training Your Beagle 
232

several one-on-one lessons from a professional trainer. When you
pick your Beagle up in the evening, she’ll be tired from an active
day, but she also will have learned some new moves to add to her
knowledge of good doggy manners.
However, you can’t expect day training to work unless you’re willing
to do at least a little work with your dog, too. Any good trainer will
do two things to ensure that your Beagle applies her new knowledge
at home. First, when you pick up your Beagle, the trainer will show
you what she and your dog did during the day. Second, she’ll give
you some written instructions on how to practice with your dog at
home.
Realize, too, that day training doesn’t come cheap. In my area, a
program that includes a week at a doggy day care, six hours of pri-
vate instruction, and a homework manual costs about $700. That
said, day training can be a great investment for a busy owner who
nevertheless wants a well-mannered Beagle — if the owner is will-
ing to practice at home.
To find a day trainer, call a few local trainers and/or some local
doggy day care facilities.
Finding a Beagle shrink
Some Beagles have behavioral problems that are beyond the abil-
ity of even the most knowledgeable trainer to fix. These challenges
include severe separation anxiety and unprovoked aggressiveness.
But just as we can consult psychologists and psychiatrists to help
us grapple with our mental health issues, Beagles (and their people)
can use the services of animal behaviorists to help them improve
their emotional well-being. Two types of behaviorists are especially
well equipped to help your little hound overcome any issues she
may have: an applied animal behaviorist and a veterinary behaviorist.
The applied animal behaviorist has at least a master’s degree in
behavioral science with an emphasis on animal behavior; many have
doctoral degrees in these disciplines. They are highly qualified to
diagnose and treat complex animal behavior problems; however,
unless a certified applied animal behaviorist is also a veterinarian,
he cannot prescribe medications. Your own vet can refer you to a
certified applied animal behaviorist, or you can contact one your-
self. To find an applied animal behaviorist, log onto the Animal
Behavior Society (ABS) Web site at www.animalbehavior.org/
ABSAppliedBehavior/caab-directory.
The veterinary behaviorist is a veterinarian who has taken post-
graduate coursework in animal behavior, completed a two- or 
Chapter 16: Rehabbing the Delinquent Beagle 233

three-year residency program with another veterinary behaviorist,
completed an animal behavior research project, and passed an
examination. Those who complete such requirements receive certifi-
cation from the American College of Veterinary Behaviorists (ACVB).
The veterinary behaviorist is particularly helpful if your dog’s
problem has a physical cause; for example a seizure problem that
may be prompting a dog to engage in very aggressive behavior.
This type of behaviorist can conduct a medical exam to determine
whether physical factors are causing a behavior problem, and can
prescribe medications when appropriate. Generally, your veteri-
narian must refer you to a veterinary behaviorist. A list is available
at www.veterinarybehaviorists.org/about_us/services.
Anyone can say call himself an animal behaviorist — but applied
animal behaviorists and veterinary behaviorists have the creden-
tials to prove their expertise. If you’re considering the services of a
behaviorist, check to see whether he’s on either the ABS or ACVB
lists. If he’s not — well, then for all you know, he’s just hanging out
his shingle, nothing more.
Reading your Beagle’s mind
Many people wish that they could just understand their Snoopy-
dogs a little better. They wonder what’s going on in their Beagles’
noggins, and are sure that a little bit of insight could help them
have better relationships with their canine companions. These
devoted owners may consider consulting an animal communicator
(sometimes called a pet psychic).
Animal communicators claim to use mental telepathy to understand
what an animal is thinking, which they then communicate to the
owner. Many say that they don’t need to meet the animal in person,
but can get all the information they need from an interview with the
owner and a photo of the animal. The interview usually takes place
over the phone, although in-person interviews are not uncommon.
Animal communication and mental telepathy have plenty of detrac-
tors. Many scientists believe that the practice is just so much
hokum. However, plenty of owners believe otherwise.
A long-time animal communicator, Penelope Smith, has compiled a
directory of others in the profession for her Web site. Those listed in
the directory must provide testimonials from past clients, pay an
annual listing fee, and agree to abide by a code of ethics that Smith
has developed. You can find the listing at www.animaltalk.net/
consultlist.htm.

Ten Ways to Keep Your
Beagle Healthy and Happy
In This Chapter
 Keeping your Beagle in tip-top condition
 Helping your Beagle live longer
 Improving your Beagle’s quality of life
A
lthough no dog lives forever, Beagles can live a pretty long
time: The average life expectancy for the Snoopy-dog ranges
between 10 and 14 years. You can do a lot to increase the odds that
your beloved Beagle will live out her full life span. In this chapter, I
give you a list of ways to not only add months or even years to
your Beagle’s life, but also to keep her happy and healthy through
most, if not all, of that time.
Find a Great Vet
Yes, you are your Beagle’s best friend. But even you, a loving and
attentive owner, can’t be everything to your dog. To live her life to
the max, she also needs the care of someone who has more expert-
ise on Beagle medicine than you probably do. That individual is
your veterinarian.
Throughout your Beagle’s lifetime, your veterinarian will work with
you as a partner in your dog’s care. Regular visits to your vet will
help to maintain your Beagle’s good health and solve any problems
that arise.
But no matter how much technical expertise a veterinarian has,
you will be less likely to use his services if the two of you aren’t a
good match. If you don’t have a vet already, Chapter 5 offers point-
ers on how to choose the right one for you and your beloved
Beagle. Chapter 12 contains valuable tips on how to work most
effectively with your vet when your dog shows signs of illness.

Give Her the Skinny
Beagles have a reputation for being insatiable chowhounds. Left to
their own devices, they’re likely to eat well beyond the point of
stemming hunger and may turn themselves into baby blimps. A
baby blimp may look cute, but looks aren’t an infallible indicator of
good health. Pleasingly plump isn’t a plus for your Beagle (or for
any other dog).
Carrying too much weight can shorten your Beagle’s life. A study
from Nestle Purina Pet Care showed that excessive eating can
cause a dog to show signs of aging earlier than would have been
the case with a normal diet — enough to reduce that dog’s lifespan
by two years. In addition, overweight Beagles are more likely than
their slimmer counterparts to have problems with their hearts and
joints because of the strain created by those extra pounds.
But if you do your part, your Beagle need not be overweight. With
your vet’s help, you can determine what your Beagle’s ideal weight
should be and work from there to get her to that point. If she needs
to pare off some poundage, feed her the correct amount of the
best, highest-quality diet you can afford to give her, and try to at
least limit the amount of doggy treats and other high-calorie good-
ies you slip her between meals. Chapter 8 gives you the skinny on
how to give your Beagle the skinny.
Keep Her Moving
Any dog trainer will tell you that “a tired dog is a good dog.” In
other words, there’s a simple secret to raising your dog to become
a treasured companion who lies at your feet or across your lap,
waking up from her snooze only to give you a loving lick. Moreover,
any dog can become such an affectionate couch potato — even the
devil-may-care, lives-to-be-active Beagle.
Ironically, the secret to creating a couch potato is to keep the couch
potato moving. Make sure she gets plenty of exercise, especially
when she’s young. A daily session of active games, such as those
described in Chapter 9, can siphon off some of the excessive energy
that Beagles are notorious for. The result will be a mellower Beagle
who’s more likely to take to training and will be more amenable to
daily love fests. A tired Beagle also is much less likely to trash your
house than a Beagle who’s rarin’ to go but has no place to go.
Of course, calming your Beagle isn’t the only benefit that regular
exercise offers. Physical fitness will help keep your dog’s heart and
Part V: The Part of Tens 
238

lungs in good condition and can help to forestall arthritis. In addi-
tion, the fit Beagle is likely to be a trim Beagle, because exercise
consumes some of the calories packed into the food she eats.
And don’t forget mental fitness! Combine exercise with games and
training that will stimulate your Beagle’s noggin. Problem-solving
toys, such as food-stuffed Kongs and Buster Cubes (which I
describe in Chapter 16), can engage your Beagle’s interest and
appetite — and keep her from turning into Destructo Dog when
you’re not home to watch her.
Do Fence Her In
More than most breeds, Beagles tend to wander far away from
where they’re supposed to be — and once they’re wandering,
they’re less likely than most dogs to come back when they’re called.
Consequently, the person who releases an unleashed Beagle into an
unfenced yard does so at his peril — and at the Beagle’s peril, too.
Predators, cars, and other dangers are ready to stop the merrily
oblivious, scent-pursuing stray Beagle literally dead in the dog’s
tracks.
For that reason, you should — no, you must! — exercise your
Beagle either on leash or within a securely fenced yard. And be
sure that fencing is real fencing you can see; many a Beagle has
withstood the shock of an underground electronic fence in the
name of pursuing a bunny, squirrel, or other critter. By the same
token, avoid tying your Beagle outside without your supervision.
The tie-out maneuver leaves your dog at the mercy of free-roaming
animals and unscrupulous humans, not to mention the ravages of
her own teeth on the leash.
Chapter 5 discusses equipping your home and yard for a Beagle,
and Chapter 9 discusses exercises that keep your Snoopy-dog not
only fit but also safe.
Take Her to School
Chapter 15 devotes a goodly number of pages to showing you how
to teach your Beagle basic good manners: to come when called, sit
and lie down when told, walk nicely on leash, ask to go out, and go
to a designated place when you need her to. So, why you might
ask, should you also take her to obedience classes?
An obedience class gives you the benefit of real-time, face-to-face
instruction with an expert: a professional dog trainer. The trainer
Chapter 17: Ten Ways to Keep Your Beagle Healthy and Happy 239

can see any mistakes you may be making and help you refine your
technique. Moreover, training amid the distractions of other pup-
pies and people can help solidify the lessons you’re trying to teach
your Beagle at home, even if those distractions make the learning
curve a little bit steep at first.
A class also can put you in touch with other dog people — maybe
even Beagle people! — who have the same interest that you do:
raising a well-trained, mannerly dog. Being able to network and
brainstorm training solutions with other people can help both you
and your dog to live more happily together.
Finally, a well-trained dog inevitably leads a happier life than the
untrained pooch because people love to spend time with a well-
behaved canine. And because just about every pooch loves to
spend time with people, the Beagle who knows how to behave is
happier — because she gets to spend more time with people than
her unschooled counterpart.
Chapter 15 gives you pointers on what to look for in a trainer, as
well as tips on how to find one.
Keep Her Pretty
A Beagle doesn’t have a high-maintenance coat — which is one
reason why a lot of people like this breed — but that doesn’t mean
these dogs don’t need grooming. Grooming your Beagle not only
keeps her pretty but also gives you quiet time together, which helps
to build and strengthen the bond between the two of you. Another
plus to grooming: The hands-on nature of the job helps you spot
potential problems, such as lumps, cuts, and skin problems. Finally,
certain tasks such as tooth brushing and ear cleaning help prevent
other health threats such as tooth decay and ear infections.
Chapter 10 gives you all the information you need to keep your
Beagle beautiful: how to give her a bath, brush her coat, clean her
ears, brush her teeth, and give her a painless pedicure, among
other tasks.
Be Proactive
The old maxim, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,”
is as true for Beagles as it is for people. Dog-care experts such as
veterinarians and trainers can do a lot to keep your dog healthy
and happy — but they’ll be able to do even more if you are on alert
for signs of trouble between visits or classes. As you play with,
Part V: The Part of Tens 
240

train, and care for your Beagle, keep your eyes peeled for possible
health and behavior problems.
On the health front, make sure your Beagle gets an annual wellness
checkup until she’s 8 or 9; at that point, switch to twice-yearly
exams. These checkups give your vet a chance to catch possible
problems early enough to up the odds of effective treatment.
At home, keep a written record of your Beagle’s health exams and
other procedures. Record when she had her last checkup, and note
on your calendar when you need to book her next exam. A sepa-
rate notebook for this purpose can be very helpful, especially if
you include copies of any results of lab tests your vet performs.
Such reports, kept close at hand, can give you more information to
share with your vet as you both work to maintain optimal health
for your Snoopy-dog.
Chapter 11 gives tips on how to maintain your Beagle’s health at
home, and Chapter 12 describes diseases and conditions that are
common to Beagle puppies and adults.
Trust Your Instincts
No one knows your Beagle better than you do — not your vet, your
petsitter, your dog’s trainer, or anyone else. Sure, they’re experts in
their fields and they’ve worked with oodles of dogs, but their
knowledge is only general. They don’t know your very special
Beagle’s individual health quirks and behavioral idiosyncrasies.
And why should they? They don’t live with your dog day in and
day out, so they can’t possibly have the knowledge you have.
That’s why, if your Beagle’s behavior suddenly changes, or she
shows other signs of not feeling up to par, you should act on your
knowledge. Call your veterinarian or dog trainer and work with
them to determine what might be wrong.
And never, ever be afraid to contact your vet or other pet profes-
sional because you think you may be making a mountain out of a
molehill. Your love-driven instincts are the best tools a pet pro has
for discovering problems early — and the earlier those problems
are found, the more likely they are to be resolved.
If you think something’s amiss with your Beagle, go with your gut.
Depending on what you’re observing, put in a call to your vet or
other pet pro — or, at the very least, watch your four-legged friend
even more closely than you usually do.
Chapter 17: Ten Ways to Keep Your Beagle Healthy and Happy 241

Have a Sense of Humor
Beagles are merry little dogs. They’re full of curiosity and take an
unabashed joy in living. For those who live with Beagles, these
characteristics are a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the
Beagle’s happy-go-lucky nature makes her an engaging companion;
on the other hand, the breed’s curiosity (especially when it comes
to unusual scents) can get your dog into trouble early and often.
The Beagle’s ability to make mischief is legendary.
As the owner of a mischief-making dog, I’ve learned that without a
sense of humor, a dog’s misguided adventures and antics can be an
unbearable trial to the humans in her life. They can cause you to
feel less love for her and may even prompt you to question whether
you want to keep your dog. On the other hand, an ability to laugh at
the mayhem your Beagle creates can go a long way toward keeping
your relationship on track and keeping the two of you together.
Of course, it always helps to know that someone has gone through
the same travails — or worse — than you and your Beagle have. If
your sense of humor about your Beagle’s behavior is lagging, try
reading What the Dog Did: Tales of a Formerly Reluctant Dog Owner
by Emily Yoffe (Bloomsbury USA, 2005). Reading about how Yoffe
and her family coped with their Beagle’s antics, and grew to love
her nevertheless, will give you a new perspective on your own
beloved Snoopy-dog.
Love, Love, Love
There’s no such thing as loving a dog too much. After all, that’s
why you got her in the first place, right? So why hold back? Let
yourself love your Beagle, even if you feel silly at first.
Go on: Get down on the floor and coo sweet nothings into the ears
of your four-legged friend. Develop silly little sayings or songs just
for her. Consider lightening up on some of your prohibitions such
as not letting your Beagle sleep in your bedroom. Take her places:
the park, the beach, the woods, the local doggy festival. In short,
make your Beagle a full part of your life.
Knowing that one is loved helps anyone to live a higher-quality life,
which is just as true for your Beagle as it is for you. You’ll never
regret making all this extra effort to please your Beagle. In giving
all this love to her, you’re creating a lifetime of loving memories for
both of you.

Ten Mistakes You Don’t Need
to Make with Your Beagle
In This Chapter
 Uncovering common Beagle ownership goofs
 Avoiding Beagle ownership boo-boos
R
aising a Beagle puppy or adult dog can be a real challenge. No
matter how much you want to do the job right, an unpre-
pared owner can find plenty of ways to bungle the job. Some of
these ownership goofs result from a lack of owner understanding;
others are a result of owner impatience with this utterly adorable
but occasionally exasperating Snoopy-dog.
Either way, many mistakes humans make with Beagles are avoid-
able — if the humans know ahead of time what those mistakes are
likely to be. This chapter describes how and why people goof up
Beagle ownership, and how you can avoid making such mistakes.
Not Doing Your Homework
The Beagle’s big winsome eyes, long floppy ears, and sweet little
snouts are guaranteed heart-melters. That said, you shouldn’t let
your heart melt to the point of buying or adopting a Beagle until
you learn more about the breed first. Then you can decide whether
this endearing breed really is right for you.
Chapter 2 offers much of the info you need to determine whether a
Beagle is likely to be the dog of your dreams — or not. For exam-
ple, if you live in an apartment, you might want to think twice
about bringing a Beagle into your domicile. The reason: Beagles
are vocal individuals, given to barking and other vocalizing that is
likely to make you a tad unpopular with your neighbors.
Taking the time now to read up on all things Beagle will save you a
ton of hassle and disappointment in the future.

Choosing Too Quickly
You’ve done your homework, and you’ve decided that a Beagle is
exactly the right dog for you. You’re sure you know what the next
step is: getting a Beagle now.
Not so fast.
When you’re choosing a Beagle, haste leads to heartbreak. A refusal
to delay gratification can lead you to choose a less-than-healthy
Beagle from a way-far-from-ideal source. Chapter 3 details those
sources, such as the Internet and certain types of pet stores. The
chapter also explains why other sources, such as backyard breeders
and classified ads, are sources not only to question but to avoid.
Play it safe and stick with a puppy or adult from trustworthy
sources, such as a reputable breeder, an animal shelter, or a rescue
group. Getting the right Beagle from a place you can trust is worth
every day, week, or month you may have to wait.
Bypassing the Crate
The sight of your irrepressible Beagle running around in your
fenced yard or tearing down the hallway of your house may cause
you to have second thoughts about using a crate to teach him
where he shouldn’t run or deposit his business. You may wonder
whether putting this carefree creature into a crate is cruel. You
may feel that a crate is nothing more than a doggy prison. You may
even fear that anyone who visits your house and sees your crated
Beagle will summon a band of Animal Cops to your home to cite
you for mistreating your beloved pooch.
Never fear. You’re not being cruel. You’re not becoming a warden
for Beagle prison. And the only thing an Animal Cop would cite you
for is for being a good Beagle owner.
Chapters 5 and 14 explain that a crate can be a Beagle’s best friend.
The crate taps into a dog’s instinctive desire to live in a small den
and to keep that den clean. A healthy Beagle won’t pee or poop in
his den if he can avoid doing so. A Beagle who’s accustomed to a
crate is likely to be a Beagle who’s got a leg up (yes, that pun was
intended!) on the uncrated Beagle when it comes to housetraining.
Here’s another benefit from crate-training your Beagle: By escort-
ing him to his little sanctuary whenever you leave the house, you
can be sure that your house will be spared the ravages of Beagle
Part V: The Part of Tens 
244

mischief-making. Your furniture, carpets, and other possessions
will be unmolested by Beagle claws and teeth.
Making housetraining easier, keeping your Beagle out of trouble,
and sparing your stuff . . . what’s not to like? Bypassing those bene-
fits by eschewing the crate is a major mistake — a mistake that you
don’t need to make.
Expecting Housetraining
to Be Easy
Although crates can make Beagle housetraining easier, teaching
proper bathroom behavior to a Beagle still is no piece-of-cake
enterprise. The reason is not that Beagles are stupid — they cer-
tainly aren’t. They just have other priorities.
The ever-confident Snoopy-dog also can be stubborn, and that
stubbornness may be reflected in a reluctance to do his business
where and when you want him to. The Beagle also is known for his
single-minded interest in following a scent to wherever that scent
may take him and for his nose’s ability to detect the faintest possi-
ble fragrance. Those characteristics mean that you need to be
determined and consistent in teaching your dog proper potty pro-
tocol, no matter how uninterested he may act. You also must be
fanatical about thoroughly cleaning up after any bathroom mis-
takes. The slightest trace of bodily waste residue on a carpet or
floor guarantees that the Beagle will return to the scene of his
crime and commit that crime again.
But like just about any dog, Beagles can be housetrained. As
Chapter 14 explains, the keys to housetraining success are
absolute consistency, abundant patience, and, yes, a good crate.
Failing to Be Vigilant
Did you fail to put one of your socks in the clothes hamper? Kiss
that sock goodbye; your Beagle made off with it as soon as it hit
the ground. Did you leave your ham sandwich on the coffee table
while you went to answer the doorbell? The likelihood of that
sandwich still being on that table when you return is zero. Did you
let your Beagle puppy explore the house on his own before he was
fully housetrained? Start looking for a puddle or pile now. I can
safely guarantee that you will find at least one, maybe even both.
Chapter 18: Ten Mistakes You Don’t Need to Make with Your Beagle 245

Until you can count on your Beagle not to use your living room as
his own personal potty, don’t let him wander through your house
without you keeping an eagle eye on him for signs that he’s plan-
ning to do his business. And never assume that your Beagle will
stay out of your stuff. Instead, assume that he won’t — and prevent
any problems by keeping your stuff way beyond his reach.
Thinking That Your Beagle
Is a Person
You come home from a hard day at the office and there in your
vestibule is a little pile or puddle of you-know-what. Nearby, your
Beagle sits, hanging his head. “Aha!” you think. He knows he’s done
wrong. You proceed to scold your four-legged friend, and you feel
sure that his apparent guilt plus your lecture will persuade him to
never, ever leave such a present for you again.
Think again.
Dogs experience many feelings, but guilt is not one of them. Your
Snoopy-dog’s woebegone demeanor probably results from previ-
ous homecomings in which you lectured him. He did not and will
not connect your scolding with his bathroom boo-boo. Heck, he’s
forgotten that he even did it.
Unlike people, pooches such as Beagles do not feel guilt over that
bad behavior, nor do they engage in such behavior for spite. They
just do what they do unless they have the incentive to do some-
thing else. With the training tips offered in Part IV, you can provide
that incentive and have a better-behaved Beagle.
Doing Things on the Cheap
Having a Beagle or any other canine companion doesn’t come with-
out plenty of expenses: the adoption fee or purchase price, vet
visits, spaying/neutering, food, dishes, toys, treats. . . The list may
seem endless, particularly if you’re in a cash crunch. And you may
be tempted to cut corners.
Maybe, for example, you think that you’ll save money if you opt for
generic-brand supermarket dog food over higher-quality fare.
Perhaps you can’t see the point of shelling out extra bucks for a
stainless steel dish when plastic is so much cheaper. And if your
Beagle gets yet another ear infection or another bout of diarrhea,
Part V: The Part of Tens 
246

you’re understandably tempted to just let it all go or try treating it
yourself, rather than schlepping him back to the vet and whipping
out the plastic yet again.
The trouble is, being penny-wise is pound-foolish when you’re
caring for your Beagle. The recurrent ear infection or diarrhea
could be a food allergy or something more serious. The plastic
dish may be cheaper but also may cause a perpetual rash on your
Beagle’s chin. The cheap food may actually end up being more
expensive than the pricey stuff because your dog needs more of
the inexpensive brand to get the nutrition he needs.
Nobody is saying that you need to outfit your Beagle in a designer
raincoat or rhinestone collar to give him a high-quality life.
(Although if you want to and can afford to do so, that’s your privi-
lege, of course.) But investing the upfront money to take good care
of your Snoopy-dog will pay off big time in good health, better
behavior, and fewer visits to your vet’s office in the long run.
Chapter 5 and Part III explain how.
Thinking That Your Beagle
Can Train Himself
Beagles are multitalented dogs. Some have excelled on the agility
field or at the obedience trial. Others shine in the hospital ward as
therapy dogs. Still others ferret out rabbits and other game. Even
more locate illegally imported fruit and vegetables at busy air-
ports. And even your own Snoopy-dog can learn to come when
called, sit when told, and potty when and where he’s supposed to.
However, he can’t teach himself any of these maneuvers. He needs
someone to teach him. Who better than you, his beloved human?
At the very least, take the time to teach your Beagle basic good
manners — and, if all goes well, think about showing him some
advanced maneuvers. Chapters 14 and 15 give you the lowdown on
teaching basic Beagle etiquette, and Chapter 16 offers pointers on
remedial training for the Beagle with learning issues. For the
Beagle who’s ready for bigger and better things, Chapter 9
describes sports that Snoopy-dogs can excel in.
Playing Doctor
The Beagle, like all other dogs, is a marvelously complicated crea-
ture. His body works because his muscular, skeletal, digestive,
Chapter 18: Ten Mistakes You Don’t Need to Make with Your Beagle 247

circulatory, nervous, and immune systems — to name just a few —
work together to keep him healthy and active. When one or more
of those systems goes awry, your Beagle gets sick.
Although you need to pay close attention to your Beagle’s health
and behavior, when he does get sick (and he will, no matter how
hard you work to keep him well), you can’t cure him yourself. He
needs professional help from his very own doctor: your veterinar-
ian. Tell the vet everything you know about your Beagle’s condi-
tion, share your ideas, and advocate for your Beagle when
necessary, but know that your vet has the training to put your
pooch on the path back to wellness.
Chapters 11 and 12 give you the lowdown on how to work effec-
tively with your vet, as well as vital information about common
Beagle maladies.
Thinking That You Are More
Important Than Bunnies
Your Beagle loves you. Count on it. He knows that you are the
Giver of All Good Things, including great grub, tons of affection,
and a warm, soft place to sleep. In his eyes, you are the most won-
derful two-legged individual he has ever met. He may not always
come when he’s called, but that doesn’t mean he is rejecting you in
any way. He just has different priorities, that’s all.
Those priorities are chasing rabbits, squirrels, and perhaps other
interesting four-legged critters — and the drive to engage in such
pursuits is hard-wired into your Beagle’s psyche. As Chapter 2
explains, Beagles were developed for the express purpose of chasing
down the real-life versions of Bugs Bunny and Rocket J. Squirrel. Put
a fluffy- or cotton-tailed critter in front of a Beagle, and that Beagle
will appear to forget that his beloved owner exists. You can’t take
such amnesia personally. This behavior is not about you.
To keep your Beagle safe, you need to recognize that squirrels, bun-
nies, and other instinct-triggering critters and smells are very likely
to supercede your dog’s desire to please you. Thus, you need to
keep your Beagle on a leash or in a securely fenced yard, so if a local
cotton-tailed burrower or fluffy-tailed tree dweller happens to amble
onto the Beagle’s turf, he can chase that critter without dashing into
the street and into the path of a speeding car. True, the fence or
leash will limit the likelihood of the Beagle actually catching the
critter — but the journey, not the destination, is what counts.

T
his chapter won’t tell you anything you absolutely, positively
must know to love and care for your Beagle. It will, however,
build on your love for this breed by sharing some little-known facts
and stories of hard-working Beagles, chronicling a few ways that
Snoopy-dogs — canine and otherwise — affect our lives.
Keeping Out Forbidden Fruit
(and Other Stuff)
If you thought that winsome, big-eyed Beagles were the last dogs
who could protect a nation, think again. These days, Beagles serve
their country with distinction by making sure that illegally
imported fruit doesn’t get past U.S. Customs inspectors. These
hard-working hounds were once called the Beagle Brigade and
worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Today, however,
they are called Agriculture Detector Dogs, and they are an impor-
tant part of the Department of Homeland Security’s Customs and
Border Protection (CBP) Canine Enforcement Program.
With the help of their human handlers, the specially trained, green-
jacketed Beagles in this program patrol the customs areas at
American airports and other border entry points, sniffing any
luggage that crosses their paths. If a dog smells any sort of fruit,
he alerts his handler by sitting down. The handler, who is a U.S.
Customs officer, then asks the owner of the luggage for permission

to open the bag. Much more often than not, the officer will find
forbidden fruit or plants that could bear pests or diseases, which
could devastate U.S. crops.
According to CBP, these dogs are responsible for about 75,000
seizures of illegal fruit, vegetables, meats, and plants every year.
Nearly 150 Beagle/handler teams currently work in the United States
at 24 airports, land points of entry, and major mailing facilities.
Shaming a President
Back in the mid-1960s, a Beagle demonstrated to no less than a U.S.
president that a dog’s ears are not designed to be handles. The
Beagle’s name was Him, and he belonged to President Lyndon B.
Johnson. During a photo opportunity at the White House in 1964,
the president attempted to show that Beagles didn’t mind being
picked up by their ears. American animal lovers felt otherwise,
however. Even the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum
acknowledges that the maneuver triggered a storm of protests.
(If you want to see the picture, go to www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/
Johnson/archives.hom/FAQs/dog/pet_image_index.asp#ear.
You can click on the “C311-7-64.JPEG” link to view a larger image of
the photo.)
Him and his Beagle companion, Her, moved into the White House
with the Johnson family in December, 1963, soon after Johnson
assumed the presidency. Her died in November, 1964, after she
swallowed a rock. Him died in June, 1966, after being struck by a
car while racing across the White House lawn.
Inspiring Children
During a visit to Shiloh, West Virginia, children’s book author
Phyllis Reynolds Naylor found a frightened, abused dog — and was
so haunted by the experience that she decided to write about the
dog. The story became the classic children’s book Shiloh, the story
of a mistreated Beagle who finds a new home with young Marty
Preston and his family. The book in turn inspired countless chil-
dren to treat animals with greater kindness, to stand up for what
they believed to be right, and to view fellow human beings with
greater empathy than might otherwise be the case.
The book won the Newberry Medal, the most prestigious honor a
book for young readers can receive, and spawned two sequels:
Shiloh Season and Saving Shiloh. Two movies, Shiloh and Shiloh
Two: Shiloh Season, were released in 1997 and 1999, respectively.

Nailing the Red Baron
Of all the characters in the classic Charles Schulz comic strip
Peanuts, the most beloved may well be Snoopy, the Beagle who puts
Christmas lights on his dog house, sleeps atop the same dog house,
and fantasizes about being a World War I flying ace. In 1966, those
fantasies inspired a singing group called the Royal Guardsmen to
record “Snoopy Versus the Red Baron,” a song that stayed atop the
popular music charts for many weeks. A video game of the same
title is available for Mac computers; you can download it from the
Web at http://snoopy2.sourceforge.net/download.html. Not
to be outdone, the U.S. Postal Service unveiled a series of postage
stamps featuring Snoopy in his flying ace regalia.
Flying in (Way) Outer Space
The television show Star Trek: Enterprise featured a canine charac-
ter named Porthos, a Beagle who belonged to Enterprise Captain
Jonathan Archer. The backstory of Porthos notes that he and his
littermates were all named after characters in the Alexandre
Dumas classic The Three Musketeers. Porthos appeared in more
than 30 episodes during the show’s four-season run. A great image
of Porthos with his best friend, Captain John Archer (portrayed
by actor Scott Bakula), is available at www.tvacres.com/
dogs_beagles_porthos.htm.
Comforting Other Dog Owners
Owning a dog can pose a considerable challenge to the most
dedicated human. Not every dog behaves like Lassie does. Some
canine miscreants steal underwear, destroy couches, and create
all-around mayhem. If your Beagle fits this category, you may
wonder whether you’re alone in your efforts to cope with your
four-legged hooligan.
Emily Yoffe, author of What the Dog Did: Tales of a Formerly
Reluctant Dog Owner (Bloomsbury USA, 2005), assures you that
life in Beagle-land can be tough for any owner. Yoffe chronicles
the capers of her beloved Beagle, Sasha, and explains how,
despite the havoc Sasha wreaks, Yoffe and her family come to
love the dog. The story of how Sasha enabled Yoffe to evolve
into a loving dog owner will comfort anyone who wonders why
her Beagle isn’t Lassie.
Chapter 19: Ten Unique Beagle Occupations and Activities 251

Knowing When to Mold ’Em
Mold is gross — if you can see it. When you can’t see it, mold can
still destroy your stuff and make you feel icky. So how do you find
the mold you can see? Never fear: Mold-detecting Beagles are here!
They’re trained the same way Agriculture Detector Dogs are —
except these doggies ignore forbidden fruit and sniff out molds
instead. After you find the mold, you can take steps to get rid of it.
Check out the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s mold Web
page: www.epa.gov/iaq/molds/moldcleanup.html.
Turning Out Termites
If molds suck, termites suck even more. No homeowner wants to
have these obnoxious critters literally eat his house from within.
Trouble is, finding the termites can be difficult, unless your house is
literally falling down around you. Enter the Termite Dog — which in
all probability will be a Beagle. Experts deem the Beagle the dog of
choice for this specialized role, which calls for the same scent dis-
crimination skills the Agriculture Detector Dogs and mold-detecting
dogs employ. And because termite infestations are often hidden,
Beagles can find infestations that elude human pest control
specialists.
Befriending the Famous
Beagles aren’t one of the most popular dogs in America for noth-
ing. Their compact size, winsome good looks, and easygoing tem-
peraments win them friends from countless unknown individuals,
but a few persons of renown as well. Among the individuals who
reportedly live with Beagles are Dr. Phil McGraw (yup, Dr. Phil);
singer Barry Manilow (who has a fan club called the Beagle Bagels
that raises money for various charities), and multiple members of
the British royal family, past and present.
Taking Us to Our Pasts
Arguably, the most famous Beagle of all isn’t a dog but a ship: the
HMS Beagle. The Beagle transported naturalist Charles Darwin to
the Galapagos Islands and the western coast of South America on a
voyage that began in December 1831 and continued for five years.
Darwin detailed his observations in his book Voyage of the Beagle —
a book that may well contain the foundations of ideas that Darwin
later developed into his theories of evolution. An image of the
Beagle in the harbor of Sydney, Australia, is available at www.
sc.edu/library/spcoll/nathist/darwin/darwin3.html.

Turn the Pages
A trip to your local bricks-and-mortar book superstore or its cyber-
space equivalent will yield oodles of offerings on how to raise and
train a dog, Beagle or otherwise. If you want more detail between
two covers than is offered by the book you’re currently holding,
consider these titles:
 Dogs For Dummies, 2nd Edition by Gina Spadafori (Wiley,
2000): This is the mother of all For Dummies books about the
canine kingdom. Spadafori has created a bible for dog-owning
novices, and answers every question a wannabe dog owner
could possibly ask without ever making the questioner feel
stupid. A great read, and an even greater reference book.
 First Aid For Dogs: An Owner’s Guide to a Happy, Healthy
Pet by Stefanie Schwartz (Howell Book House, 1998): Every
dog owner should have a compact guide to basic first aid,
and this pint-sized hardcover fills the bill nicely. Schwartz is

a veterinarian, but she writes in terms that lay people can
understand about a wide variety of canine emergencies and
mishaps that owners can treat on their own.
 The Holistic Dog Book: Canine Care for the 21st Century
by Denise Flaim (Howell Book House, 2003): Chapter 11 of
Beagles For Dummies touches on conventional and alternative
medicine, but this book gives you all the info you could possi-
bly need on the latter. Flaim is the pet columnist for Newsday,
the Long Island, New York, daily newspaper, and uses all of
her knowledge to create an informative guide to cutting-edge
thinking in alternative dog care.
 Housetraining For Dummies by Susan McCullough (Wiley,
2002): Teaching proper potty protocol is a challenge for many
Beagle owners. However, this little manual tells you every-
thing you need to know about the housetraining process and
then some. If Chapter 14 of Beagles For Dummies doesn’t do it
for you and your little hound, this book will fill in the gaps. I’d
recommend it even if I hadn’t written it!
 The Power of Positive Dog Training by Pat Miller (Howell
Book House, 2001): Miller is one of America’s best dog train-
ers, a passionate advocate of positive reinforcement training,
and a former president of the Association of Pet Dog Trainers
(APDT). In this book, she explains the science behind positive
training in clear, understandable terms, and describes with
equal clarity how to transform that science into a humane,
effective training program for your dog. I can’t recommend it
enough.
 Senior Dogs For Dummies by Susan McCullough (Wiley,
2004): Senior dogs need special care and consideration to
keep their more mature years truly golden, and this book tells
you how to do just that. I also provide extensive coverage on
dealing with the end of a dog’s life — a subject that frightens
and worries all too many owners of older dogs. And just like
with Housetraining For Dummies, I’d recommend this book
even if someone else were the author.
Divine DVDs
Plenty of trainers spread their brands of the dog behavior gospel
by creating DVDs for the viewing public. Some are famous, but
fame doesn’t guarantee that the trainer’s methods are effective or
humane. For those reasons, I’ve limited my DVD recommendations
to those by two trainers whom I’ve personally observed to be
humane and positive in their approaches, and who get great
results from both their human and canine students:
Beagles For Dummies 
254

 New Puppy! Now What? by Victoria Schade (Rocket Media
Group, 2006): I live with a dog who is a great adult canine com-
panion but was a little monster when she was a puppy, espe-
cially on walks. Then I met Victoria Schade, who proceeded to
take Allie and me in hand with a series of simple but highly
effective at-home private sessions that helped me teach Allie
some basic walking manners. With this DVD, other owners
can benefit as I did from Schade’s techniques. Order it from
www.newpuppynowwhat.com.
 Really Reliable Recall by Leslie Nelson (Healthy Dog
Productions, 2004): No trainer I’ve seen is more effective than
Nelson in teaching a dog to come immediately. This DVD ver-
sion of Nelson’s renowned “Really Reliable Recall” classes
includes help for challenging breeds such as Beagles. Order it
from www.dogwise.com.
Peruse These Periodicals
If you want more timely information than books can offer, maga-
zines are your ticket. Magazines about dogs and other pets come
and go, but the titles listed here have stood the test of time. Unless
otherwise noted, they’re available on newsstands at book and pet
superstores:
 AKC Family Dog (American Kennel Club): For people who
love purebred dogs but aren’t interested in dog shows, the
AKC offers this quarterly magazine. The emphasis here is on
dog care and integrating your dog successfully into your
family life. The magazine is available only by subscription; log

call 800-533-7323 or log onto www.akc.org/pubs/index.cfm.
 The Bark (The Bark Inc.): This bimonthly title lives up to its
billing as “the modern dog culture magazine.” Although it
does include some dog care information, most of the maga-
zine’s pages focus on essays, literature, and art about dogs. 
 Dog Fancy (Bowtie Inc.): This magazine is probably the most
widely read dog-oriented magazine in America. Whatever you
need to know about living with your Beagle, you’ll find here.

Who can resist an adorable Beagle puppy? If you adopt one from a breeder,
you can bring him home when he’s 8 weeks old.See Chapter 4.
Isabelle Francais

Beagles are inquisitive little dogs.Their
looks,intelligence,and playfulness
make them one of the most popular dog
breeds.See Chapter 1.
Not only do Beagles bark,they howl.
You can minimize these canine concerts
by keeping her entertained with toys or
activities.See Chapter 16.
A Snoopy-dog’s sniffer can lead him to mischief.Keep your sense of humor,
and you and your pet will get along beautifully.See Chapter 17.
www.jeanmfogle.com
Isabelle Francais
Isabelle Francais

Just like you,Beagles need
time to rest,especially as they
grow older. See Chapter 12.
Beagles have one 
of the best senses 
of smell of any 
dog breed.They
instinctively track a
scent,no matter
what.See Chapter 2.
Kids and Beagles can be a
perfect match.Beagles are
just the right size to romp
with youngsters without
worrying about whether
one may hurt the other
one.See Chapter 6.
www.jeanmfogle.com
Isabelle Francais
Isabelle Francais

Beagles are happiest when they’re
getting lots of love and attention from
people.That makes them well suited to
visit people in hospitals or nursing
homes.See Chapter 2.
A Beagle works at getting treats out of 
a plastic ball.If your Beagle suffers from
separation anxiety,keep him occupied
with one of these toys when you leave.
See Chapter 16.
Training to compete in agility trials gives your Beagle a good 
workout and allows the two of you to bond.See Chapter 9.

After a full day of activities with you and your family,your Snoopy-dog 
will be worn out.A tired Beagle is a happy Beagle! See Chapter 7.
Dog shows measure
how well a Beagle
conforms to the
standard of his
breed. See Chapter 9.
Isabelle Francais
Isabelle Francais
Beagles were
bred in the 1500s
to hunt rabbits.
Today their keen
sense of smell is
used to detect
termites and
mold in houses.
See Chapter 19.

If you and your
Snoopy-dog spend a
lot of time outdoors,
make sure to check
her for fleas and 
ticks.See Chapter 10.
Beagles like to explore
every nook and cranny
they find.You’ll want to
Beagle-proof your house
and yard before you
bring your little hound
home.See Chapter 5.
You need a lot of time and
patience to train a Beagle to
behave and perform tricks,
but the results are worth the
effort.See Chapter 15.
www.jeanmfogle.com
www.jeanmfogle.com
www.jeanmfogle.com

Because Beagles have short coats,they only
need a bath about once a month — unless
they find something dirty or smelly to roll
around in.See Chapter 10.
Your Beagle needs annual checkups
with her veterinarian to keep her in
tip-top shape.See Chapter 11.
Beagle pups need three meals a day to help them grow up healthy.As dogs get older,
they just need breakfast and dinner.See Chapter 7.

Choosing a Beagle takes
time and thought.You
have to decide whether
you want a pup or an
adult,a male or a female,
one dog or two.See
Chapter 4.
