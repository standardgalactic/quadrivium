Bringweather and the
Portal of Giving and Taking

We found her that sterile winter night with Ariel by Sylvia Plath
on the bathroom sink and the first Cowboy Junkies CD tolling
from the stereo. The philodendrons, the ficus, and the Swedish
ivy in their terra-cotta planters had wilted. The Prophetess herself
lay in her clawfoot tub with Xs carved in her wrists.
"Obviously, my boy," said the Great Bringweather after smelling
the bathroom, "this was a kidnapping!"
I was crying so hard that I could only speak in fits. "D-D-Don't
-- you think it's more -- likely -- that she committed suicide?"
"Suicide, Brune?" Bringweather spun away from the bloody tub
and aimed his eagle face at me. "Suicide?" The yellow tassel of
his Minnesota Vikings stocking cap bobbed over our heads. "If
you're so certain, where's the note, eh? Hmm? Answer that!"
The Prophetess's final letter was in my hand. I'd found it on the
lid of her indoor compost heap when I came home. Crying loudly
now, I handed him the note.
"Oh. I see. Well." Bringweather removed reading glasses from
his London Fog trench coat. "It's her handwriting, at any rate."
He smoothed one handlebar of his outrageous moustache and
read as if to an audience. "'I hate the incessant needs of my
barren body.'" He stopped and looked at me over the top of his
glasses. "Incessant? Is that a word? It is? Sounds French to me."
He cleared his throat wetly and continued reading. "'The eating,
the sweating, the brushing, the bathing, and worst of all, the
emitting. All to what end? Old age.' Oh, terrible! The Prophetess
stopped seeing the poetry and love of the Great Heap! 'Every
morning a trip to the toilet, and it never ends all day long in the
unyielding variety of emissions -- the pale liquids, the thick
liquids, the odious solids, the gases--"
Bringweather dropped the note on the bathroom floor.
"Sad," I sniffled, wondering if he'd read what I had read between
those lines.
"Evil!" Bringweather declared. He strode into the living room,
then he stopped by the Prophetess's compost heap and pointed
back at the paper on the floor. "An evil spell that decries life and
the Cosmic Animus, and we never should have touched it. This
was no accident, just as I suspected. Sorcerous trickery is afoot.
A midwinter strike against the Holy Heap! Brune! Come with
me!" With the skirts of his trench coat flaring Bringweather took

That was
