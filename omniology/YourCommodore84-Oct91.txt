One day when I had bought
My YC magazine
I couldn't ﬁnd my tape
It was nowhere to be seen
So I hassled poor old newsie
And he gave me it no probs
And then he said unto me
"You're crap, and your poem doesn't rhyme!"

play, hurrah!
with the odd to
kick to the
amily

ariety -
it's never
failed.
Last
Battle is
typical
hero
quest that
challenges
you to
overcome many
obstacles and solve a
few puzzles, which will help
you rescue Alyssa faster.
There are also
conversations between you
and some of the characters
which will give you hints; but
beware, a few are tricks.
At the end of each
chapter, you'll come across
three slimy near-invincible
heroes who will make your
TTLE
the ability to pick up objects,
which is especially fun
because you have to smash
up boxes and other objects
before you can ﬁnd them,
and once you've got 'em you
can use them to crack open
the opponents' sculls,
hurrah!
The game is a bit of a
laugh, doubly so when
you've got an able chum to
take control of your other
joystick. It was all coded by
Mike Hutchison from
Creative Materials, whose
previous track record
contains the
excellent E-Swat and
the, er, OK Double
Dragon II, so his two-
player games are
constantly on the
way up; and Final
Fight is his best to
date.
The graphics,
blocky though they
are, are brilliantly
mission a life of
misery, with
each chapter
being
divided
into
stages
ﬁlled
with
action
and
dodgy
ninjas
ﬂying
around from
all sorts of
angles.
An extra bonus (or
tragedy, depending on your
skill) is the Labyrinth (minus
David Bowie!), which is full of
enemies - more of those
ninjas. You can gain power
or points, too. More power
will enable you to have a
better punc h and kick like a
horse.
The only problem is that
the Labyrinth will only appear
when certain conditions in
the chapter are achieved...
Last Battle sounds like a
spiffy game, huh? Wrong! It's
just your average beat-'em-
up with graphics that are
very p0000r looking, in the
large - just like the Capcom
coin-op its been converted
from. And although I've
actually completed the
arcade machine, I can't see
the later levels of this 'un

actually). If you're a fan of

and you'll not fail to see them in software shop windows up and down the country along with

HOT GOSSIP
Short stories which are hotter than a Ilindaloo and juicier than
your average Jaffa!
MAD MAX
It's mad, we know but US Gold is set to announce what looks
like being the best compilation this year. Maximum Action
Xtra (MAX for short), sounding more like a jar of coffee than a
software compilation, includes the hit games Turrican II, St.
Dragon, Night Shift and Swiv - phew, you'll need the coffee to
keep you up all night playing it!
Another compilation, entitled Super Sim Pack, is also
making it's merry little way to you. This bundle of simulated
fun includes, International 3-D Tennis, Crazy Cars II, Italy 1990
and Airborne Ranger. Sounds sim-ply great (Groan! Readers).
EXPRESS YOURSELF
All your fave lovable characters could be coming your way
soon courtesy of the Sales Curve, 'cos the Battersea-based
company has signed up an
exclusive deal with Hi-Tech
Expressions, who are
responsible for licensing
from Walt Disney, Hanna
Barbera and Warner
Brothers.
So, before you can say
"What's Up, Doc?'', you'll be
seeing Bugs Bunny, Daffy
Duck, The Muppets and
Tom and Jerry on your C64,
although their spokeslady
did stress that the licenses
would be of a more
educational/utility genre.
Just the stuff, eh, to help
you with the old homework!
It's ofﬁcial, Domark's 3-D Construction Kit has made a million
pounds at retail [i.e. in the shops]. And I  always thought
money grew on trees!
Incentive's highly-acclaimed product has sold so well that
Domark is receiving over 40 user registration cards per day
and is busy collating all the information and ideas, which will
be published in a regular newsletter. Hurrah!
VIRGIN GET A NEW MOTOR
If you were to see the Virgin

for not actually doing the homework.

a rather irate customer, and a

Later on in this ish, you'll see that Cheetah took Jeff (and others) Go-Karting
to launch their rather spiffy new joystick ,'The Bug'.
What you might not know about is the rather strange marketing campaign
that the company have been running, which largely involves YC's ofﬁce
getting ﬂooded with pieces of paper with famous celebs on - except that
their heads have been replaced by a pic of a Bug joystick (e.g. Bug
Springsteen, ho ho) in each case.
Now, cos we rather like this 'stick, we're going to give some away!
They're normally E14.99 but ﬁve of you will walk away with one completely
free, gratis and for nothing! You'll also get ﬁve T-shirts and pile of stickers!

OF YOUR ST
• R o l l up, roll up, roll
up! Spectravideo is
knocking down the price
of its two popular slick
sticks. The Manta-ray
and Sting-ray, launched
this year, are now down
two quid from E15.99 to
£13.99. It's got to be a
barg 'cause you can buy
next month's copy of YC
with the remainder'
If you're the kind'a
person who wears a
Cartier watch and
Reebok trainers you'll be
interested in
Spectravideo's latest
stick from the USA
called the Gravis. It
features a full-size
padded foam handle, 8
position centring control
so you can pre-set the
feel of the stick and 3
ﬁre buttons to allocate
separate functions.it's
deﬁnitely the Porsche of
sticks, costing a
staggering £39.99. But
as they state: 'it is often
more expensive to
economise". I think
they've been watching
too many Fairy Liquid
ads (Either that, or
drinking it! Group Ed).
The Royal Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty
to Joysticks, if indeed it
existed, would be more
than chuffed with
Spectravideo's new
launch called the
"Freedom Connection".
It can transform any
joystick to a wire-free
infrared form and comes
in two units - one plugs
into the computer and
the other is plugged into
your stick. It can then be
carried around with you
or clipped to your belt.
Priced a t
must for all you Joystick
Rights Activists!
Finally on the stick
front, Product 2000 has
launched a new red-hot
range onto the market.
The 3 models are called
the Microjet, Superjet
and Megajet and all
feature high quality
microswitches and the
unique 'comfort' grip.
They're identiﬁable for
their bright red bases
and are available now.

HUM..
SCRUMMY
If charging around, jumping on muddy
and sweaty bodies, is your sort of sport
(hang on, we're talking Rugby not mud
wrestling here) then you'll be pleased to
know that Do mark is set to release the
ofﬁcial Rugby World Cup game and
judging by the information we've
received it sure looks as close to the real
thing as possible - without the smelly
feet and tom ears though.
It's a realistic top-down view game,
featuring all of the 16 international teams
and smooth multi-directional scrolling -
which allows you to see one ﬁfth of the
pitch at any time. A radar at the top of
the screen will show the current position
of play in relation to the actual pitch. The
knockout rounds are just the same as in
the World Cup - four groups of four
teams with a points system for winning,
drawing or losing - with the top two
teams going thorugh to the next round.
You'll be able to experience all the
excitement of the real game with try-
scoring, conversions, scrums, kicking,
shirt pulling and even shoving and
barging. It sure looks scrummy doesn't it
- and it'll be in the shops late September

Green issues are certainly a priority
at Mirrorsoft as they prepare for the
release of the second Turtles
licence. This time, though, the
exploits of the pizza-breathed
foursome are based on the smash
kit Konami Coin-op.
The game format is a beat-'em-
up set in New York and you can
choose which awesome green
dude to play. First you will have to
rescue poor old April O'Neil from a burning building and if that's not enough
you'll have to face the evil duo BeBop and Rocksteady. Then it's to the
rescue of Splinter who gets kidnapped by Shredder. Finally you'll have to
rout the formidable Foot Clan, rescue Splinter and then face Shredder in a
showdown at the Technodrome. My word, what a lot to do, but when all is
said and done, you're a green millionaire hero!
The coin-op conversion is being managed by Probe, who will be chomping
away on Pizzas until November to bring you the ﬁnished product. Until then
dudes, you'll have to watch the second ﬁlm, keep on wearing the tatty old
faded T-Shirts and hope to keep on impressing your Granny by continually
saying "Cowabungan.

ITS THE PITS•. NO NOT REALLY!
Atari's fastest-ever selling Tengen Coin-Op, Pitﬁghter, is ﬁghting its way
onto your computer shortly.
It's no game for the wimps amongst you, I mean it's so damn hard,
the ﬁghting is deﬁnitely below the belt and there are no rules. And
choosing from names like Buzz, Ty or Kato and using wrestiing, kick
boxing or karate, you know it's far from fairy-bashing.
There's four ﬁghters in the pit so the punch-up can be between any of
the contenders, i.e. one against one or in gangs against the rest. At the
end you are awarded a knockout bonus, a brutality bonus and your
share of the dosh. A grudge match is held every third match to allow
you to wreak vengeance on your opponent. The main aim is getting to
the Championship match in which you get the chance to rob the
Ultimate Warrior of his title.
Teque is ﬁghting to get the program to you, via Domark, for Christmas
for £10.99 cassette and E14.99. It's bound to be a knock-out!

Just as you thought it was safe to go back into your
Kebab shop... Domark is set to release Taito's Super
Space Invaders onto home computer. "But that will
be dead easy to program" I hear you shout Ha!
Aliens and the likes have progressed a lot in 13 years!
The game will feature level after level of
increasingly weird and hostile invaders (i.e Saddam
lookalikes), amazing multi-way scrolling playﬁelds,
waves of aliens, swooping in from all angles, dozens
of different attack formations, huge end-of-level
baddies and secret hidden levels for you to ﬁnd.
Er, guess what you have to do - yep, blast the
buggers back to where they came from - preferably in
bits and pieces - and collect power-ups for souped-
up weapons, e.g. a Firef lower to frazzle them or a
HyperLaser to sizzle them.
The Kremlin is programming this addictive
masterpiece and it will be available in October for
E10.99 cassette and E14.99 disc and you can be
guaranteed many a good night in front of your screen
with or without a Kebab!

So, driving games are going out of fashion are they? You try telling that to the entire computer games industry, cos if it's got a
car in it, it's big (and I mean BIG!) bucks!
Mirrorsoft has announced the latest release to add to Turbo Charge and Outrun Europa, and it's based on the excellent
1 Jaleco coin-op, Cisco Heat.
But what's so different about it? Well, for a start you play one of the rozzers in your spanking new San Frascisco PD car,
and you have to race through the streets of San Franscisco (cue Michael Douglas, side-burns, ﬂares, and pimps in pink, furry
trilbies), against other members of the force.
Although one driving game is much the same as any
other when it comes down to gameplay. it all depends on
how fast this one will be.
Look for it on the Imageworks label this November!

1 1 1 1  Spots is a dice
game for up to four
players, although
the game allows the
computer to play any or all
of these players. Brief
instructions are included in
the game and a more
detailed explanation is
included below. The game is
similar to some commercial
dice games but uses more
dice and slightly different
rules that increase the
strategy element of the
game.
Play involves initially
rolling six dice and
subsequently choosing to
hold on to or roll, any or all
of them in up to a maximum
of three further throws. The
aim of each throw is to try to
use the dice to make one of
a number of scoring
patterns. Thus the skill lies
partly in choosing which
dice to hold on to and which
to rethrow, and partly in
deciding how best to score
the result.
There are fourteen
patterns or categories that a
player may aim for and these
are listed on a scorecard at
the side of the playing area.
On completion of each throw
a score must be entered in
one of these categories,
even if the dice do not
complete the chosen pattern
in which case the score for
that category will be zero. So
a complete game consists of
fourteen rounds, each player
ﬁlling one category on his
scorecard each round.
The fourteen categories
can be broken down as
follows. The ﬁrst six are the
number categories 'Ones' to
'Sixes and are used to score
any pattern of dice that
contains any dice of the
selected value (Ones =1,
Twos =2 ...) - the score in
each case is the sum of the
spots on these dice. For
example the dice pattern 6 6
1 4 6 4   would score lx1 = 1
point in 'Ones', 2 x 4 = 8
points in 'Fours' and 3 x 6 e.
18 in 'Sixes'. If the pattern
contains no dice of the
selected value, then the
category score would be
zero.
The next three categories
are 'Short', 'Long' and 'Full'
and are used to score
patterns that include a
number of dice whose spots
are in order. 'Short' requires
at least 4 dice in order so
any of 1234, 2345 and 3456
will score the 10 points
available. 'Long' requires at
least 5 dice in order so
1 2345 or 23456 will score the
20 points available. A 'Full'
requires all six dice to be in
order so only 123456 will
score the 30 points here.
(Note: the dice no not have
to be displayed in the given
order, the points will be
scored as long as each of
the dice needed is
somewhere in the ﬁnal
pattern.)
The four categories from
"Set3' to 'Set 6' are used to
score patterns which have a
number of dice showing the
same spot pattern. 'Set 3'
requires at least three of the
dice to be the same, 'Set 4'
requires 4 dice the same and
so on up to 'Set 6', in which
all six dice should be the
same (which does not
happen very often!) The
scores for these categories
are 20,30,40 and 50 points
respectively.
The ﬁnal category is
called 'Chance' because it is
a chance to score ANY
pattern of dice, the core is
simply the sum of all the
spots shown on the six dice,
so 241 262 would score 2 + 4
+ 1 + 2 + 6 + 2 = 17 points,
the minimum score is 6 and
the maximum 36 so don't
waste it.
In addition to these
scores two BONUSES are
awarded, the ﬁrst if
concerned with the number
categories is greater than 69
a bonus of 50 points will be
added to the player's score.
The second bonus is
awarded at the end of each
game, for each player it
starts at 25 points and is
reduced by 5 points for each
category with a zero score,
so if a player has more than
four zeros on his card he ill
get no points from this
bonus.
Control of the game is
achieved using joystick in
port number 2. The joystick
will control a 'cursor' on the
screen, use the joystick to
point the cursor at the
required function and press
the button. There are several
selections to be made at the
beginning of each game,
such as number of players,
but these are self
explanatory. On the main
screen of the game are
several option;
The number s 1 to 6 are
used to move dice into a
'rack' which then may be
kept whilst other dice are re-
thrown. To score a given die
in the rack, simply select the
number that is shown below
that die.
The remaining three
options are:- 'Roll' which is
used to re-throw any dice
that are not scored in the
rack, 'Dice' which is used to
empty all the dice out of the
rack - in case you change
your mind or ﬁnd a better
pattern to keep, and 'Stop'
which will move all of the
dice into the rack and end
that turn.
In a similar way, scoring is
done by pointing the cursor
at the selected category on
the scorecard and pressing
the button. Choose carefully
as mistakes cannot taken
back!
The only section not
controlled by the joystick is
the entering of player's
names. This is done directly
through the keyboard.
Names may be any
alphanumeric sequence of
up to ten characters, the
names are not checked in
any way as they are purely
for the beneﬁt of the players.
As explained in the
program to make the
computer ply for a particular
player, simply press the
Return key without entering
any name for the player. The
computer will give its ﬁrst
player the name CPU 1.
second CPU 2, and so on.
For anyone interested, 4r-

lir the strategy of the
computer players is based
simply on probability and
loss minimalisation - the
computer will attempt to
make the pattern it thinks
has the greatest probability
of success and will score the
results so as to lose the
It is said that, back in the
20the century, there used to
be people who repaired
computers when they broke
down. They siad that
computer repair would be a
thing of the past way back in
the 21st century - little did
they know!
Of course, now that the
impossible has happened
and a military satellite has
passed through a freak

malfunctioned, and is getting
itself ready to blast us all to

They've given me the
'Microdot', a tiny remote
controlled craft capable of
entering the satellite and
absorbing all the 99
radioactive particles that the
storm left scattered around.
And, of course, it's my job to
pilot it around, avoid the
hazards, collect the particles
and save mankind, again!

they expect of me. Once I've

As the game is largely
dependent on chance - the

For players with creative
tendencies Microdot comes
complete with its own
construction set. This allows
you to create a whole new
set of levels. To enter the
editor press 'E' while on the
opening screen.
Editing the Layout
The landscape in Microdot is
made up of blocks of 3*3
characters; including the
reset triangles, rubber mats,
etc. Each level is a 13 by 7
matrix of 91 blocks; the main
labyrinth is a 12 by 12 matrix
of 144 levels.
A joystick is used to move
the cursor through the levels.
If you move out of the matrix
you will move out of the
editor and back into the
opening screens of the
game, the back arrow key
(top left of keyboard) has the
same effect. The ﬁre button
on the joystick is used to lay
the character that you are
currently moving around.
Press any letter to change
the character that you are
going to place. The Inst-Del
key will display all of the
blocks available. The
function keys are used to
select which of the four
different block styles is
selected.
If you want to delete, the
@ key will select a character
that allows you to rub-out
your mistakes.
To set the start point
press the k e y .
Two blocks (F and X)
consist of 3* blobs of
electricity and appear to be
identical. Well, they're not.
Always use F, except when
the blocks form a pool
embedded in the ground.
Each room has separate
key as indicated will return to
the title screen and the start
of the game.
At any time between the
title screen and the ﬁnal
scores the game may be
aborted and re-started by
pressing the Control (CTRL)
key.
colours for the blobs of static
electricity, the rubber mats
and the four different brick
types, these are normally
changed with keys 1-6. Since
these keys are also used
when editing the objects a
letter at the bottom signiﬁes
which mode these number
keys are in. When C is
displayed the number keys
change the colours, when S
is displayed they change the
objects of Sprites. Use the
RETURN key to change
mode_
With spark traps use the N
key to lay the beam between
the pointers.
Positioning Objects
The moving blocks of
electricity, radioactive
particles, bonus triangles and
the ﬁnal electricity switch are
all sprites or objects. A
maximum number of seven
sprites is allowed in each
room, each with its own
reference number. To create
a new sprite use the lowest
unallocated number, eg. if
there are 5 sprites on the
screen press key number 6, 1
on a screen with no sprites,
etc. To change an existing
sprite simply press its
number.
Alter the position of a
sprite by moving the joystick,
alter its colour by pressing C.
Press I  to move through the
four sprite types. Sprites can
be wiped using W or ﬁxed by
pressing ﬁre.
Moving sprites travel for a
speciﬁc time and then return.
This time is measured by the
RU value shown at the base
of the screen. This is
changed with the + and -
keys. D is used to change the
starting direction, S changes
the speed of movement and
A.changes the animation
speed.
To see what your sprite
looks like hold down the left
shift key. NB sprites must
NEVER overlap.

O
Isbisima is, to say
the least, a little
upset. Tomorrow
is his daughter's birthday
and he has no idea what to
get her.
As Magic Knight you
have been ordered to ﬁnd
the Princess Germintrude
a very special present.
This may be your chance
to prove that you are
worthy of joining the
famed 'Polygon Table', the
highest honour any Knight
could wish for!
The King transports you
to the Castle of Spriteland
which is teeming with
many weird and wonderful
creatures. Also there are
two mazes which contain
many of the Queen's
relatives! Apart from the
grisly ghouls and energy
sapping creatures there
are ghostly traders who
are often quite willing to
exchange the treasures
that you ﬁnd in the Castle
for money which they stole
in their former lives.
Some objects will react
with each other to form
either more or less
valuable objects, to sell or
collect. You now have two
choices:
1 You may try and
collect as many treasures
as possible and escape
from the Castle of
Spriteland.
2 Collect the treasure in
order to please the King
and the Princess
Germintrude and join the
Polygon Table.
Will the temptation of
keeping all the treasures
be too much for you or are
you loyal to the King and
the Polygon Table of
Isbisima? 0

Kentilla has a
sophisticated input
editor to ease
command entry.
CAPS SHIFT 0 -
Delete character at
left of cursor.
CAPS SHIFT 9 -
Insert a space at
cursor.
CAPS SHIFT 8 -
Move cursor right.
CAPS SHIFT 5 -
Move cursor left.
CAPS SHIFT 1 -
Recall last command.
This must be used
before any other input
is made. It is useful
for lengthy battles,
correcting mistyped
commands or
conveniently altering
a command leg. after
KILL URGA you might
want to EXAMINE
URGA so just recall
the last command
and overtype KILL
with EXAM).
ALL can be used
with the verbs GET
and DROP to pick up
everything in a
location or drop
everything carried. It
will ignore hidden
objects, etc., and
dead characters.
LOOK is used for
seeing into
containers, eg LOOK
INTO CHEST. It can
also be used to look
at adjacent locations,
eg LOOK EAST will
tell you what objects
and creatures (except
hidden ones) are
there.
When giving an
object to a character,
it must be done in the
form: GIVE (object)
TO (character). Eg.
GIVE SACK TO ELVA.
Talking to other
characters
To talk to another
character you must
mention the character
and use quotes, eg.
SAY TO OGERON
"GIVE ME THE
SWORD". Friendly
characters will usually !
cooperate if they can
- others not
necessarily!
Kentilla is a richly devious adventure. Collecting objects is not
an end, just means to it. You may have to revisit some locations
a number of times in order to make overall progress, and time
may be of the essence. Much is hidden, and not revealed at ﬁrst
examination. Apparently useless things might have curious
effects on those who threaten you. The very title of the game is
of great importance in its playing b u t  you will ﬁnd that out

My Left Foot
made a
gripping,
intense ﬁlm,
well-worthy of
it's numerous Oscars but
it would hardly convert
into a good computer
game.
1
So just what is it that
attracts software publishers
to certain ﬁlm licences?
Does the computer ﬁlm biz
have its ups and downs like
Hollywood? What are those
all important ingredients that
make a Top 10 ﬁlm-licenced
computer game?
•  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •
THE MONEY PIT
The ﬁlm licensing trade is
not to be toyed with, that's
for sure - it's a risky and
expensive business. Hudson
Hawk has just become the
second ﬁlm to cost $100
million and has ﬂopped
miserably in the States.
You only have to look at
the amount of cash that
goes into making a box
ofﬁce smash these days; the
1 8 0  Y C
•  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •
sets, the ﬁlming and the
millions of dollars the
stars command, not to
mention their expenses.
Only recently we
heard that Kim Basinger
insisted on washing her
hair in Evian water every
day, during the making
of Too Hot to Handle.
It's no wonder that
when I asked Publishers
how much a ﬁlm licence
cost, I drew a blank. All I can
say is, that it's damn
expensive!
Think of a successful ﬁlm
licence and you'll link it only
to big Software Publishers;
Ocean, US Gold, Mirrorsoft,
Domark, Grandslam,
Activision, and more recently
Capstone, Disney and Titus,
who obviously have the
amount of cash needed for
such a venture. However,
each deal is unique_ It
depends on how many rights
you require as to how much
the total bill will be. i.e. just
Europe, and how many
computers you intend to
convert it onto, i.e. home
computers only.
The price of ﬁlm licences
was certainly a deciding
factor in Domark's Company
Policy. Although they
published the Star Wars
FEW
trilogy and Bond licences,
they have decided of late to
stick with safer options of
baseball and ﬂight
simulations; As Domark's
MD, Mark Strachan
explained: y ou take a huge
risk when signing a ﬁlm
licence and it might not
succeed. It's a huge
responsibility and we have
our staff to think about."

11., What exactly attracts
a publisher to a
111111.-
do they plump for a
particular kind of ﬁlm?
A jolly good script is
something L u c a s
Gold look for, with a strong
storyline and plot, as the
Indiana Jones series of
games rely heavily on
intrinsic puzzles and
adventure elements - so
much so, that they will be
releasing Indy 4, just based
on the script alone. The
same can be said for the
Godfather licence.
The actual movie stars
can be an attractive aspect
as Stephen Hall of
Gmndslam Entertainments
explained: "buyers like to
identify with the licensed
characters, Bruce Willis is a
good example-, and, let's
face it, computer games
are all about giving
pleasure and enjoyment to
the end-user, well that's
what Grandslam aims to
do!".
The Blues Brothers
game is about to be
released by Titus and at
ﬁrst light did not seem a
good licence, but as
Marissa Pauwels
explained, "they're crazy,
destructive, funny, always
in trouble with the police...
people like them".
It is of no surprise that
ﬁlms, which star heroes like
Arnold ,Schwarzenegger,
Bruce Willis and Hanison
Ford, big names like
Sigoumey Weaver and
Michael J Fox and not
forgetting "likeable" and
endearing stars like
Macaulay Culkin, Bill 'N'
Ted, The Blues Brothers
and The Turtles, are
snapped up because as the
end-user has no problem
identifying with them and
would relish the prospect
of playing the game in their
starring role.
The type of ﬁlms that
publishers snap-up tend to
be those which appeal to
their target audience.
When all is said and done
Publishers are in the games
business, so it would be no
good signing up a licence
that was aimed at the over
40s, like Shirley Valentine.
As Capstone's
Marketing Manager, Claire
Bowen explained, "brand
recognition is important.
Mention the names Bill N
Ted or the ﬁlm Home
Alone, to a kid and they'll
know who and what you
mean." •

have the money
and will take the risk,
how do they go about
purchasing a licence? It's
not just a case of seeing a
good ﬁlm at your local
cinema and nipping down
to Sainsburys to pick it up.
New licences have to
be snapped up by
Publishers before the ﬁlm
has even been screened.
That means reading
through scripts. Mirrorsoft,
riding high on the success
of Turtles, Back to The
Future II & Ill and Predator
II actually hire a agent in
America, namely Mr Dick
Lehrberg.
He told us that you
usually purchase a licence
by dealing though the
actual studio such as 20th
Century Fox, Universal or
Disney and that most
studios have appointed
licensing agencies, who
handle all of the
merchandising rights.
However, he did stress,
that you do have to
convince the studio that
the ﬁlm will be safe in your
hands, i.e. that the
company produces high
quality products, has a
good presence in the world
market, has good
marketing strategies, and
will consider consoles.
With Mirrorsoft's track
record he has no problems!
Even the stars become
involved sometimes,
explained Lucasﬁlm/US
Gold spokeswoman, Sue
Luciano. Both Michael
Jackson for Moonwalker
and Harrison Ford in the
Indiana Jones series
wanted to approve the
artwork and see
themselves pixelised as
part of the deal for they did
not want themselves
portrayed in a bad light.

THE BEST

There's been so many of
the buggers, which ones
should you bother to tiy
out, and why?
BATMAN - THE MOVIE
-an)
This is the ﬁrst deﬁnitively
good ﬁlm licenced game,
and worked because of
two factors; a) it was
loosely based on the ﬁlm,
and b) it had the policy
that has now become
Ocean's trademark in
such cases, by being a
multi-level game with
varying playing styles, all
based on different.
sections of the ﬁlm.
Everything about it is
right, and although the
early sections are hard,
it's all very rewarding (it
also had the biggest
licence of all time, save for
the new T2).

PREDATOR
(Activssion)
The ﬁrst of AmieIs ﬁlms to
be made into a game, and
was a bit of a corker in its
time. It was a left to right
scrolling-shoot-em-up-
action game, and is best
remembered for having
the chunkiest looking
sprites possible - after all,
one of them was our Am!
The game was a bit hard
though, on reﬂection!

BACK TO THE FUTURE 3

Probe coded and
designed this, based on
the movie, but had the
problem that the ﬁlm
company wanted them to
feature (of all things) as
many pie plates
throughout the game as
possible - even though
Marty only throws one of
the dam things in the
whole movie. Nonethe-
less, they followed Ocean
in splitting the ﬁlm up into
different sections, and
therefore featured several
different games in one.
The best section by far,
was the duck shoot, but

ALIEN
(QuicksiNa)
& ALIENS
(Activision)
Alien - the game - was a
strategy game that you
really didn't want to play
in the dark. You had to
guide Ripley (and Jonesy
the cat), and as many of
the crew of the Nostromo
as possible, around the
ship and escape. The
tension was amazing and
for a game that came out
in 1984 it was, and is,
surely a classic.
Aliens - the UK version
(for there was a more
typically crap American
version too) - also had
that brown trouser appeal.
The aliens jumped out at
you when you least
expected it, and the action
was based more on
escape than killing the
xenomomhs.

ROBOCOP & ROBOCOP 2
(Ocean)
The ﬁrst ﬁlm was brilliant,
the second was pool The
ﬁrst game was average
and the second was a real
stonker!
Ocean decided to be a bit
more conventional with
the titles, and based them
more around one speciﬁc
style (although they both
had similar bonus
sections where you had a
shooting gallery). That
style was shoot-em-til-
they-drop-em-up! And lots
of it just like the movies!

TERMINATOR 2
(Ocean)
Reviewed last ish, this
game is obviously a bit
more advanced than any
of the above. Its multi-
level variety is well set,
with a good range of
thangs to do. There's
beat-em-up sections,
arcade-adventure
sections, car chase
sections, and helicopter
shoot-out sections. The
graphics and presentation
are also as up-to-date as
you'd expect. And c'mon,
Terminator is the biggest
thing since someone
discovered that if you
ground wheat, mixed it
with other things and
baked it, it tasted quite
pleasant!

for outstanding
acting and excellent
direction in a good ﬁlm. Mr
Average likes a good old
shoot out, whilst Ms
Average tends to like a
good drama or thriller and a
soggy hankerchief. So
what secret ingredients to
publishers look for in a ﬁlm
to make it a good game?
Overall, action and
excitement were
companies' favourite
ingredients. Grandslam's
MD, Stephen Hall, seemed
to sum up this whole
aspect when he said: "a
game has got to have that
sweaty joystick reaction".
Just like sitting on the edge
of your sweaty seat in the
cinema, I suppose!
Types of action lend
themselves superbly to
games. Take the Bond
licences for instance, apart
from the action and
suspense, "there are four or
ﬁve unbelievable stunts
which, when converted,
make an excellent game",
explained Domark MD Mark
Strachan.
Public awareness of
the ﬁlm also rides high on
publisher's agendas. For
Entertainment International,
the sales and marketing
Company behind Dick
Tracy, The Blues Brothers
and Arachnophobia, a ﬁlm
licence is a Godsend.
Their spokesperson
explained: "there is already
a big marketing machine
behind the ﬁlm, so the
public already know the
product in a way, it makes
our job a whole lot easier!".

If Publishers alike, all jump
on the back of the publicity
bandwagon and release the
game in line with the ﬁlm or
video then their marketing
becomes easier.
There certainly is a lot in
a 'name' in the computer
industry.
"We only sign the
biggest names," said US
Gold's Alexa Czechowski,
"It must be a blockbuster",
said Mirrorsoft's Cathy
Campos.
Publishers would never
sign up the most recent of
Thames Monday Night TV
Movies, starring who?,
who? and who?, for it is so
important that the movie
from which the game ﬂows
has been commercially
successful.
Ocean's Batman, for
example - would the game
have been a success
without Tim Burton's movie
idea and the sheer hype
surrounding it.
This is where the
element of risk and
expertise comes into it as,
in order to snap up the
most recent of licences,
publishers must sign up
from reading the scripts, as
Mirrorsoft's agent Dick
Lehrberg commented:
"The hardest part for us
is in reading the scripts and
ﬁguring out which ones will
make hit movies. Star
power is no guarantee.
Bruce Willis' Hudson Hawk
just released in the US to
incredible hype, has died a
miserable death. If we
could accurately predict
hits from scripts , we'd
probably be making big
screen movies instead of
movies on 3.5" disks".
Even conversions
though can be a hit or a
ﬂop. Dick Tracy, Total
Recall, Nightbreed to name
but a few, were all hits in
the cinema, but died a
death as far as game
sales go.
A hit in the cinema
doesn't necessarily
guarantee a good game,
for at the end of the day
the quality of the product
has to come up to the
standard of the ﬁlm. US
Gold, spokeswoman Alexa
Czechowski stressed this
as she talked about their
Godfather licence; ''The
Godfather is a strong
name and it has to be a
strong product. Our
Development Team,
Creative Materials have
gone as far as travelling to
New York to study the
architecture. Quality wise
out product will be
faultless."
A good review on Film
90 or in Time Out does not
equal a YC Fun One. It's a
bitchy and risky old
business, the ﬁlm
licensing trade, as we
have just found out and if
Publishers want to make
big money out of big-
budget ﬁlms, they'll just
have to sit on the edge of
their seats and wait for the
end result! 0

more should write in.I think

I just thought I'd include my

Er, by the way, don't you

Dear Posty
How's it going?
Please tell Rik
Henderson that he is a
complete and utter a"*hole.
In the June edition, when he
said "C64s were crap" and
'he was an Amiga man now",
in Computer Boffo of the year
1991, I was going to get my
C64 posse to go round to his
house and surgically remove
his small brain and stuff it
where the sun don't shine. If
he is an Amiga man, why is
he still working for VC? He
can sod off.
Oh yeah, is Gunfright out on
budget for the C64?
Carl Jones, Wellingborough,
Northants
PA: Cor,
blimmin' ﬂip!
Get up on the
wrong side of
the bed did we?
When you
compare the C64 to an Uzi
9mm, of course it's crap! I
mean, you can't mow
down a group of animal
rights activists with a ten-
year old computer can
you?
And you'll have to put up
with Rik even more now,
'cause he's your new
Group Editor, and he's
here to stay - or at least
until the men in the
ambulances arrive to take
him to his four star padded
cell!
And Gunfright is not, to my
knowledge, ever going to
be out on budge t. 'cause
it's a pile of dog's muck,
so get a life!!!
ckADear YC
I'm going mad, angry
and vicious!!! You've got to
answer my questions or else,
and please print this as letta
of da munf (sorry, no bribe,
no letta of da munﬂ - PA)!
1) Is there any other way of
receiving more memory on
the Commodore 64?
2) Can you list your top 5
games and music (I would
be grateful for this)?
3) Which computer is better,
the Sega or the 64?
4) Are the following games
ever going to be released
on the C64 or C640S:
Golden Axe, Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles,
Super Mario Bros.
(Nintendo kind),
Wonderboy Ill, Mickey
Mouse, and Street Fighter
II?
5) Will you ever put any disk
games on the cover?
6) Can you get any 3D
glasses and light phaser
gun on the 64? If yes,
where?

How about letting your gran do the letters page? Now, that would be different.
Let's talk (oo-er)... I live in Newport Pagnell, yes, Newport Pagnell. What do you
mean you've never heard of it? Good God man, wake up. Newport Pagnell has a
well known service station, I mean everyone knows Rik got stuck in the bogs there! Oh
yeah, and it's near M.K. (Milton Keynes), so I live next door to the YC guys (well, nearly).
There's this kid called Maff who makes weird noises like "Guuuuugggghhhh", so if this
letter gets printed please title it Grunt (NO! - PA). Thanks, now let's get down to the point
(oww, that point was sharp!).
YC in general: It's crap (only joking!), though it does suffer from people copying other
mags' tips and too many mistakes (like the Star Control review).
Questions...
a) I ordered the tape including Wabbit and it still hasn't come. I wrote this on the 8/8/91.
Please could you send me the tape?
b) Is anyone going to convert Growl, the arcade machine?
c) What is the best cricket game?
d) What do you think is going to be the Xmas no. 1?
e) Have any of the Ye crew ever been to Soft-ly in MK city centre? It's crap isn't it? Or
have they been to Willen lake?
That's it for now

ways to make your mag
better. Firstly, your magazine
is great (that's what all
people say, right?). But
there's a problem, where has
all the colour gone? It's
mostly blue, black and white.
Please add more colours, it'll
be a hit!
Next, you should add some
programs to type in (or
people should send some in
and they could win
something great!). It's for the
people who are new to the
Commodore 64. One more
thing is to add more reviews.

PS, Don't let yourself down!
PA: Alright
(yawn) here's a
few answers to
your questions:
1) Memory on
the 64? Sorry,
what was the question
again?
2) I didn't know whether
you meant top 5 games
and top 5 bands, or top
5 game music, so I've
given you all of them:

3) It depends on a) how
much cash you're
willing to spend, and b)
what you want to do
with your machine! The
C64 is the best 'cause
we don't cover the
Sega, and you'd
miss out if you had one
of them.
4) Golden Axe - about a

impressed with your

sounds like a prominent

there, pitting your wits

The only angle of the game

hen the Mars-a-day man Gazza
wept for his country in the World
Cup, the nation took him to their
hearts. Now, crying is a tradition when
Gazza is involved and 'Gazza's Soccer'
will certainly have you in tears ma in ly
due to such a lousy effort of a footy
simulation.
This game does not do any justice to
the Geordie lad at all. Whilst he was out
in Italy sweating his heart out and, of
course, making mega bucks, Domark
(and originally Entertainment
International) go and bring him down
from behind Ninny Jones style)!
The designer must've thought the
more viewpoints in the game the better,
'cos it starts in side view, and when you
get to the goal area it switches suddenly to sort-of top down. This
sounds okay in theory but in practice it jolly well don't work, as
the controls change also, so nine times out of ten your little man
will just wander off the pitch, into the dressing room, and onto the
number 49 bus.
Man Utd Europe is the game of the century for footy sims and
World Championship Soccer was the worst until now. That
honour is now, without question, Gazza's this ranks as highly as
Sophie Lawrence's singing.
But if you would like to tackle Europe go ahead, this is
deﬁnitely a Spurs fan's game i.e. you'd have to be thick to buy it-
(Careful! Ed), the rest of us should treat it like the plague - keep
well clear of it.

US G: Yeppy-doo-dahs!
We're US Gold, the amazing

classic games like Raid Over

mention Outrun or World

calling to inform you that

MU: We know, as we have

and were well impressed!

how would you like to give

So that's it readers! That's
the Honest-To-God truth of

Well, we've made it completely and utterly easy-peasy - so

East End gangland - and they know what to do with kneecaps,
cement mixers and the bottom of the River Thames.
All you've gotta do is ﬂick through the ENTIRE copy of this ish of
YC and spot as many Mega-Twins as you can (they're quite easy to
recognise, really). And when you think you've seen them all, write
how many there are on the back ota postcard (or sealed envelope).

'Hurm," said a
bod at System 3,
fancy that we

or not, they have, but not any
old driving game, no siree.

responsible for the only game

Turbo Charge breaks
boundaries in more senses
than one. Firstly, its plot
revolves around you trying to
reach different borders in
different countries, and
eventually catching up with a
known third world leader and
blowing them away, and
secondly, it does it in quite a
unique fashion (although you
wouldn't notice at ﬁrst).
One complaint that's
normally aimed at such a
product is that it's too hard to
control the car and shoot the

enemy at the same time -
after all, it IS an arcade game,
and not a simulation! Turbo
Charge deals with this by
having you actually control
the road, and not the car -
which, although it feels like
you're controlling the car at
all times, means that
you are not
likely to crash
into off the
road obstacles.
At times there
are points where the
road splits into two,
and you have to
watch which way
the opposition cars
go to see which way you
should go, otherwise you'll
run head-long into a brick
wall, and I bet that smarts!!!
This all adds to the frantic
action of Turbo Charge, this
and the shoot-'em-up aspect
where you can blast your way
through everybody, with
either your pea-shooting Uzi
9mm, or a he-uge rocket
launcher.
Also, when you get to the
end of each section, the
world leader will be waiting
for you, and he'll weave about
the road ﬁring shots at your
car, while you shoot at his,
it's basically a battle until
one of you runs out of
damage points.
The graphics are
pretty cool,
with an
incredible
number of
roadside extras
(bushes,
advertisements,
camels - you
know the sort of
thing!), but the
real impressive side of it is
the speed - to be honest I've
never even played an Amiga
driving game that was this
fast.

Butler, also coded Power
Drift, but has easily surpa-
ssed even his excellent work_

First there was
Outrun, which
was, in a nutshell,
crap! Then came
Turbo Outrun, and surprised
everybody through being a
truly stunning arcade
conversion, and boasted
probably the best graphics
ever seen on a C64 driving
game.
Now here's the game that
was meant to come
out in between the
two above, and
the question is
"where on
Earth did I
leave my
umbrella in
1984?"
The answer to
that is,
unfortunately, that I
have no idea - but I do
know that Outrun Europa is
the best of the trilogy by far!
So far, in fact, that it's
currently living on a small
ic eberg just off the coast of
Iceland.
Firstly, the gameplay is a bit
more varied this time than
just the old 'race-'til-you-
drop' type displayed in the
originals, for two reasons,
really.
There are some sections
where you can lob bombs at
the opposition, and some
where the boost will come
into use. But the
biggest
extension on
the theme
is that
each level
(i.e. each
load) is a
truly
separate
game, with a
different vehicle
at the forefront for your
use.
The other incredibly novel
thing about Outrun Europa is
that it's not a game
smothered in pictures of
blonde babes in bikinis and
Califonian beach bums
hanging around trying to get
a glimpse of the latest in
Ferrari technology.
Instead, your car has been
absconded, nicked, annexed,
taken by force, stolen, and
it's not here anymore. So in
your chase to get it back you
have to jump on any old
bicycle that happens to fall in
your favour.
The graphics are not as
good as the previous game
(Turbo Outrun) which is a bit
of a strange occurance, cos
Probe did them both, and
unfortunately the multi-loader
takes absolutely ages!!! But
that's enough niggles, now
comes the paragraph of
absolute praise...
WHAT A SPLENDID GAME!!!
Er, that's it. It's not as good
as Turbo Charge (what could
be?) but it deﬁnitely comes
close. 
W
h
e
r
e
 it
falls down is in difﬁculty (it's
a bit difﬁcult for people like
me, i.e. crap at games) and
lack of action-orientated
gameplay. If you, like me,
love driving games it'd be
well worth getting both of
these games - after all if you
add the cost of each
together, it's still cheaper
than a crappy Amiga game.

EXTRAS
8
Loads of meanies
to blast, a change
of car colour when
you go into tunnels,
and occasions
when the road forks
into two and you
have to follow the
correct way!
10
More vehicle
changes than
James Bond!
There's also the
option of a boost
button (like Turbo)
but you can
replenish your
boost by picking up
icons along the
way!
OPPOSITION
10
More meanies
along the route
than there are
sheep in Wales.
And incredibly
tough end.of.level
cars that you have
to blast.
9
Many other cars
(not as many as
Turbo though),
but has the police
involved as they
try and sneak up
on you.
AT THE CHEQUERED FLAG (out of 70)
Turbo Charge 63
Outrun Europa 59
So Turbo Charge is the winner by just two points,
hurrah! But as you can see by the games'
Credit Cards, they are both completely brilliant!!

Poor old Koala
Island, it s always
having a rough time.
This time a Soviet
powemlant has exploded
and radioactivity has covered
a 300 mile radius. As a result,
the climate has changed
dramatically and all life-forms
have mutated into, well, to
say the least, quite hideous
4 0  0  Y C
5 RADIOACTIVE
THINGS:
creatures. Although these
creatures are beyond
recognition, they still posses
the characteristics and
intelligence of everyday
people, since some of them
were once human.
They are quite dangerous,
so they must be disarmed or
destroyed before they can do
any real harm, which they
1) Nuclear Missiles
2) Nuclear Power Stations
3) Most of the Ukraine
(after Chernobyl)
4) Many British sheep
(ditto)
5) Rik's underpants (Oi!
Group Ed)
may well do when they ﬁnd
the remains of the
powerstation and try to blow
up the world, as these people
always seem wont to do. I'm
sure they're nice people
really, and have families and
love each other and things
like that, y'know.
Anyway, you have to
storm in and basically shoot
the hell out of everything.
The gun you are armed with,
although small, is quite juicy
(it's not how big it is, but
what you do with it) and can
really let rip when needs be.
Just as well, considering that
some of the monsters to
shoot are made up of 64
whole sprites (i.e. pretty
damn large) , so they do
require quite a bit of
"learning".
The graphics are
excellent. There are
absolutely tons of sprites, all
really well designed and the
background graphics are
brilliant. There is a two layer
parralax scroll, very similar to
that of Flimbos Quest, that
works really well. Some of
the sprites are (as mentioned
earlier) absolutely humungus
like for instance a huge
'Sumo wrestler' type of
person that punches the
ground and sends masonary
dropping everywhere.
There are creatures that
are on your side, that have to
be freed from their cages so
they can assist in some way.
The ﬁrst one lets you sit on
it's back as a more efﬁcient
form of transport, with a
chunkier weapon also.
Control over your man is
very good. Its easy to move
around, jump and shoot. The
jump especially is very good,
as you can move your man in
mid-jump, making it all very
precision. I think the best
idea is to just keep your
ﬁnger on the ﬁre button, with
auto ﬁre of course!
The music and sound
effects ﬁt the game really
well, the sound effects
especially seem to be perfect
for it,
The presentation on the
whole is excellent.The title
screen is great and the

loading screen with a running
man, is brilliant. There are
loads of ﬂashy little effects
everywhere, like when you
ﬁnish a level and it loads the
next.
Loads of smoothness all
round, loads of ﬂashing
colours, and, basically it's a
very polished product.
This is deﬁnitely worth
buying if you are into the
shoot 'em up scene, even
just a little bit. There's more
to it than just killing things!

the compo winners from the July ish.

the names and addresses for some of the compos to the generous
companies who've stumped up the prizes.

(except, perhaps, the cost of a stamp) if you enter a compo, so DO
IT! We don't run Lem for nothing, y'know...

 Gasp in amazement!
If men like Carl Lewis
can run at
outstanding speeds - even
the Soviets - why oh why do
computer programmers work
at the speed of tortoises?
And to make matters worse.
they eliminate the meaning of
originality.
You are probably thinking
to yourself, has Jason gone
and ﬂipped his lid (Yep, that
had sprung to mind! Readers)
and has he become totally
mad? Or is it due to the
inﬂuence that Rik has over
him? No way Jose, it is those
people at US Gold and their
''let's re-release Gauntlet
again" stance.
The question which arises
is, why? Were the other two
big ﬂops and US Gold can't
face up to it? The answer is
no, of course.
But weren't one and two
identical with few
differences? And didn't they
have mazes that were seen
from so far away that you
needed binoculars to
play?
Well, er, yes! But
Gauntle
3 is a
vast
improve-
ment, you look
at the game in a
new perspective
with a much
improved angle
on the action,
which give you
a better feel for
the sim. Once again heroing

two main themes, with "let's
have fun and kill a few
ghoulies to pass the time"
type action.
Once more heroes are
needed but with Spidey and
friends all webbed up and
Harrison "Indy Jones" Ford
hanging up his boots we're
calling out for new ones. So,
even after going to the
outermost areas of the
universe, searching for
heroes from different regions
to take on the task, not one
could be found.
The old heroes
return (giving up their
part-time work). I
mean,
have you
ever
wondered
what becomes
of a hero? In
everyday life you can
see the Wizard
down your very
own shopping
centre at Xmas,
in a Santa Claus
costume, and
the Rockman has
the pleasure of being a stock
broker or a bouncer at some
dodgy night club looking
after those lager louts.
The Rockman would be
able to re-arrange your face
for no charge at all and may
even be the next plastic
surgeon for Cher.
But now the eight heroes
have all come back.
Gauntlet 3 is a 3D scroll-
play, action-packed - and at
times humourous arcade-
adventure with little ghoulies
that go boo - as well as a
multitude of other meanies -
and come from a ghost

TWENTY THINGS YOU
NEVER KNEW ABOUT
ROCKMEN;
1. They eat rocks!
2. They like to gyrate their
lower bodies whilst
playing air guitar!
(Er, are you sure about
this? Ed)
3 Sometimes they get part--
time jobs as lavatory
assistants.
(This is getting silly, that's
quite enough Rockman
facts! Ed)
TWENTY THINGS YOU
NEVER KNEW ABOUT
ELVES:
1. Elves have pointy ears.
2. Elves are always very ﬁt.
3. This is because of the
National Elf Service!
(This is not funny in the
slightest, get on with
something else! Ed)
TWENTY THINGS YOU
NEVER KNEW ABOUT
WIZARDS:
1. They have long white
beards, probably!
2. They normally wave their
arms about and chant
unitelligible things, like
"Abracadabra" and 'Abba
are great!"
3. Abracadabra was a song
by Steve Miller.
4. So was the Joker.
5. The Joker was in Batman
the movie.
6. Jack Nicholson played the
Joker.
(Er, I think you've strayed
a bit here! Get back to the
point! Ed)
7. Paul Hardcastle once
wrote a song about
Wizards!
8. They quite like Top of The
Pops!
(Careful! Ed)

Just when you are recovering
from your last ninja ﬁght and
your wounds are healing.
that Chinese takeaway menu
has grown once again, in the
form of ''BWOH FOOS" - just
pronouncing that name is
enough to give to you
indigestion.
But Bwoh is actually a
master of the oriental martial
arts and has laid down a
challenge once again. Why
are these ninja simulations
so predictable? The dark
side never lays down after it
has taken a hell of a hiding.
TWEET,

They need their mouths
shutting for good, with a big
cheesy ninja foot smacked in
their gobs and a few punches
to the head giving them
cauliﬂower ears.

STACK UP
Zeppelin C2-99
Those youngsters in jolly boring old Oxford in their fancy
stolen cars, burning rubber, will have one all mighty stack-
up down the motorway sooner or later. So why be a fool
like them when you can have a stack
your own home on your Commodore (That's a rather
tenuous link, Jason! Ed)
Stack Up is a highly addictive game which requires a
little brain power and can punish your head!
You have to solve the best position to store falling
signs - the principal of stack up is that of "Tetris" but the
difference is in the symbols. You are spoiled for choice,
there are food symbols and little
bananas do a strip show
performance as they
descend, pretty
radical, huh!.
If that was not
enough, there are
even green men
and many more
intriguing
symbols!
You have to
place the
symbols in
horizontal and
diagonal lines
like a cross
between Tetils
and Connect 4 and
this concept makes
the game very spunky
indeed.
In fact, it's a corker of a
game.

THE NEW
ZEALAND
STORY
Hit Squad E3.99
The New Zealand Story is,
supposedly, a hilarious
adventure beat-lem-up
simulation with a Kiwi as its
hero, armed with a bow and
arrow to accomplish its
mission.
Auckland Zoo has been
troubled by an psychotic
walrus who has an appetite
for kiwis (so why did he miss
this one).
Not only does he like a
kiwi for his dinner but he has
all the zoo held captive
around the nearby islands.
So this little jumped- up
squirt of a kiwi has the task
of beating up a walrus to
rescue his buddies,
destroying all the creatures
that get in your way. If you
fail, you'll look OK on a
dinner plate. I guess.
Sadly, some
programmers just have no
idea about an action-packed
sim; who wants a mothball
creature to be their ideal
hero of all time? I don't! No
way! Why use a kiwi to do
this heroing, especially given
=•••••.w.....•••••••••••••
that this kiwi looks like Edd
the Duck after a lawnmower
accident.
If you don't mind wimps
as heros then this game is
OK and can be rather fuuny
in places.

enemies ever to be seen? You are a bounty hunter in
one of the most enthralling action-packed simulations
ever. Star Wars may have been a really
big hit and grasped all the kiddies
by the ears but this is by far
the greatest adventure
ever based in space.
Things will get ugly
and violence will be
very handy but
mayhem is your
middle name and
killing is your job,
so zaparising those
evil suckers will be
a pleasure, as will
leaving their bodies
all over the place!
Retrograde is a
Star Wars-y adventure
working on a
horizontally-scrolling idea
that works fantastically,
making the game a real corker_
Retrograde is a real gem.

pressure as these plants are
eating up the oxygen and
the world is becoming very
hot indeed. Unfortunately
you are but a leg with a
basketball stuck on top, and
therefore completely crap,
and you must jump around
ﬁring the basketball at the
various creatures and
ﬂowers. I did say it was bad,
but this takes the biscuit.
It all takes place in a six

P
 level invested jungle, but
you're most likely to just get
the unholy mess off your
screen as soon as possible!
T
country
bumpkin
farmers use
snares to capture
animals in, and
although this is a
rather barbaric
thing to do it's
also a real good
metaphor for
Snare. The
reason why is
that the person
who came up
with this is
torturing the
computer world.
Snare should
be kept out of all
yougsters hands,
because having a

S
y
be Einstein to work out that summer camp is
based on an American idea! Yeah, summer
camp - all that foliage, fresh air, water sports
and barbecues as the nights draw to a close.
Being an American cartoon adventure,
Summer Camp starts with the pride and
joy of America having been stolen, and it
is your task to return it, cos you're the
prime suspect. No, the burgers and soft
drinks have not gone missing, the pride
and joy of the U.S.A. is the stars and
stripes, and there are only 24 hours left
before the opening ceremony of the
camp and it will be a disaster without the
ﬂag. How will they have a nice day when
the big American pride is as big as an ant!.
Summer Camp is a real rib tickler for
everyone, consisting of four very large levels. You
SUMMER CAMP
have to collect as much acme boxes as possible to create a
vehicle in which you can return to the summer camp
and pass onto the next stage. So, that's why
teenagers have Acne, so they can build a free
cart (Er, I think you mean Acme, not Acne!
Ed).
If you're looking for a laugh a minute
this is one that'll even please Les
Dawson fans (ie. they don't get to laugh
very often).
The structure of Summer Camp is a
, platform arcade/adventure with the
sr 
m
o
s
t
 crazy cartoon ﬁgures - with you as
Maximus Mouse - and is a real spiffy
game.

have landed and are
here to stay. The fuzzy-
wuzzies have been captured
by evil demons and held
captive and that one and
only Radcliffe has the chance
to be the hero of the day. Any
mistakes, though, will lead to
torture scenes which are
hilarious and comical as
Creatures is an
arcade/adventure/squish-
em-up with a really weird
sense of humour behind it.
A creature being a hero in
zit on the end of
your nose the
size of a golf ball
is better than
playing it and no-
one likes to have
zits. Mind you
they can be
eliminated with a
bit of cream,
computer
software can't.
Although
Snare is like the
plague, not all is
lost because the
idea behind the
game is quite
good - it's just
the rather lousy
game play that
lets it down, and
it is the most important thing to
take into perspective when
computer games are involved_
The actual game has no
less than 20 levels, and you
must navigate your way
through deadly mazes whilst
hunting for treasure. Its all
based on a scrolling screen,
and this game had everything
going for it, but it fell at the ﬁrst
fence as you get the idea as
somewhere it went wrong. It
has the most awful control
system to use to control your
spaceship, and in the end you'll
be pulling your hair out of your
head.

a violent game is a big joke
but it works every so often.
This being one of those
times, with zany creatures,
such as moles and their
chainsaws as dirty work is
involved. And killing and
zapping is all there for good
measure.

wind that was building up
in his bowels.

the landlord!" he
spluttered.
"I am the landlord!"
cackled the ofﬁcer, as he
changed into Bigbird
from Sesame Street.
"You shall be hanged by
the neck until dead!" he
laughed as he ﬂew off
into the sunset.
Eugene woke in a cold
sweat.
"Phew!" he said,

Bubble Bobble
Here is a Bubble
Bobble playing guide
from Jonathon Parry
in Birmingham.
Tip 1: To build up
your score when
you've killed all
the nasties,
stand near a
wall and blow
bubbles. They
will burst and
you will get 10 points
for each.
Tip 2: If you see a
chest or walking stick
with a bow tie, collect
it. Then kill all but one
of the nestles and
capture him in a
5  4 0  Y C
bubble, and blow lots of
bubbles around him. Burst
the bubble with the nasty in
it. and a large bonus item will
fall to the ground. All the
bubbles will turn into
minatures of what ever it is.
Tip 3: On some levels when
you burst the last nasty
bubble, all the other bubbles
will turn into goodies. So it is
best to blow loads of
bubbles before you catch the
last nasty, so you can ﬁnd
which levels this works on
and which it doesn't.
Egg thingys: Touch these
oval shapes and they shoot
about the screen killing
anything it touches.
EXTEND: Collect all bubbles
with letters in them, as once
you have collected them all,
you skip a level and get an
extra life.
Bottles: All the nasties
dissappear and funny shapes
appear. Collect all of them
withion the time limit.
Clock: All nasties stay put.
Glowing skull; all nestles stay
put again, and you become
invincible and run very fast.
Silver cross: Floods the
screen killing all nasties.
Red cross: Makes you shoot
ﬂame instead of bubbles_
Yellow cross:
Shoots
streaks of
lightning
across the screen, killing
nasties.
Purple trophy: Kills
everything, except Bub and
Bob.
Red and yellow trophies:
Both make you blow bubbles
faster and further.
Apparently there are loads
more features, if you ﬁnd any
really good ones, send them
in! A Prize for the best
Bubble Bobble tip!

THOUSAND YARD STARE
One of them lives in a paper bag!
Slough isn't noted for its
famous pop bands. There's,
er... er... we can't think of
any, actually. But Thousand
Yard Star could be set to
change all that.
Formed in 1988, they've gigged
around the country many times and have
released one or two platters on their own
Stiﬂed Aardvark label. Now they've
signed a big-cash deal with Polydor and
their next single, No Score (After extra
time), will be out very soon indeed.
The band are Stephen Barnes
(Vocals), Dominic Bostock (Drums), Sean
McDonough (Bass), Giles Duffy (Guitar)
and Kevin Moxon (other Guitar). We
Interrupted them all in the studio and
spoke to Sean, the Yardies' bass-player...
Why did you choose the name?
We liked it cos it indicated thinking big,
looking forward. We wanted a big, brash-
sounding name to make big, brash-sounding
music.
Did the band ever have any computers?
I used to have a Spectrum. We're a really
Spectrum band. Spectrums were better than
C64's! We've got a Nintendo Gameboy at the
moment and we want to become Tetris
kings. I think ve've missed about a week of
studio work through playing it!
Would you do a computer game
soundtrack?
No, but we would do a cover version of the
Klax soundtrack!
What's the most bizarre thing that's
happened to the band?
Having to go on stage after a magician in
Brighton and playing next to a swimming
pool in Exeter!
What's the best place you've ever
visited?
Dominic's fridge! And when we were going
to Aberdeen, we stopped off at a castle and
it was really good.
And the worst?
Milton Keynes. But I only went to the
McDonald&
What's the band's philosophy?
Have a good time, all of the time!
If you were a vegetable, which one would
you be?
A cucumber, cos they're green and
environmentally friendly. Giles would be... a
much worse guitar player!
If you were an animal, which one would
you be?
A hedgehog. Giles would be a mole, so he
could dig up football pitches, he hates
football.
Which fruit would you be and can you do
an impression?
An orange. [Phone goes silent for a moment]
There! Well, everyone here thought it was a
really good impression!
How would you describe Slough in 5
words?
Football, multi-cultural, train-to-Windsor!
There's nothing to do in Slough unless you
go to the ice-rink and get your head kicked
in.
Do you have a tidy bedroom?
No, neither does Dominic. Kevin's not got a
bedroom, he's got a brown paper bag in the
corner!
If you could be a pigeon, who would you
crap on?
Eric Thorsvedt, Spurs goalie.
What's your favourite colour?
Red! Cos Arsenal wear it!
What would you ﬁnd down the back of
your sofa?
The TV remote control that'd been lost for a
year!
What would you be if you weren't in the
band?
A full-time dreamer!

'Daddy, what did
you listen to in
the 70's?'
c i
went all funny! A
new breed of
loud, brash,
young bands
offering music to shock your
parents emerged - punk
rock! Not all of them had
safety pins through their
noses, though, some of them
looked quite respectable and
could knock out decent
guitar toons.
One such combo were
the Buzzcocks, who came
from Manchester and who've
inspired other bands from
that city, such as The Stone
Roses, The Smiths and the
Happy Mondays.
Document records are
rather keen on the
Buzzcocks and believe that
their records are classics,
especially 'Spiral Scratch'
(their ﬁrst EP) and 'Time's
Up' (a previously practically-
unavailable bootleg). And
now the label have released
them into the shops.
So if you fancy getting
hold of a slice of the 70's
Underground sound, get
hold of these discs!
Blake's 7

If you thought science

Blake's 7 is classic British TV sci-
ﬁ, originally broadcast in the late
70's and early 80's, never
repeated and now released two-
episodes-to-a-tape by BBC Video
at the rate of two every month or
so.

Jacobls Ladder (18)
If there were
awards for most
suddenly-
shocking arty,
slighty-
confusing, hold-on-what's-
going-on' ﬁlm of the year,
Ja co b s Ladder would win
them. It's all of the above
and concerns a guy who
begins to have terrible
ﬂashbacks to his tour of duty
in Vietnam - one particular
night, in fact, where
something rather terrible
occurred.
This begins to affect his
work at the Post Ofﬁce, his
relationship with his
girlfriend and his whole life.
Well, it'd affect you too if you
kept getting nearly killed by
demons in fast cars and late-
night tube trains. He also
experiences fantastical
harrowing dreams which are
really nasty. Jacob attempts
to get to the bottom of it all
and has to address just what
is real in his life.
The ﬁlm itself is nicely
ﬁlmed and acted and its
ending is freaky as anything.
But only go if a) you're over
18 and b) you don't mind
being suddenly jolted out of
your skin!

of
might of the all-powerful
Federation - the government of
most of the Universe - which is
corrupt, evil and all the other
things you'd expect someone to
be ﬁghting against. Luckily for
Blake and friends, they ﬁnd an
incredible spacecraft early on and
spend most of their time buzzing
around the Galaxy, avoiding their
arch-enemies Servalan and Travis
(ofﬁcers of the Federation).
What makes the whole thing
so good is not the acting (dodgy)
or the scripts (risible) but the
costumes and the strange ideas
that 70's set-designers and
scriptwriters had about the future
(sideburns and ﬂares in the far
future? I suppose it could
happen!). Its an experience aswell
as being mightily entertaining.
Keep a look out for it. Blake's 7
may have had a small budget but
they stretched it a fair way.

A few years ago,
Voice of the
Beehive had a
few cheery pop
hits, and then
they disappeared! A month
of so they returned with a
vengeance with another
hit, 'Monsters and Angels'.
Now they've got a new
album, 'Honey Lingers',
and a new single (which is
a cover version of a 1971
song!). And when you read
this they'll be in the midst
of a tour, but we caught
Daniel "Woody" Woodgate,
drummer with the band
(and, before that, with
wacky early-80's pop
funsters Madness), before
they left!
What's your favourite
piece of clothing?
My 501 Levis, and my
American green bomber
jacket. I've had a green one
since 1979 and it never left
my back.
What's the strangest place
you've ever played?
In Warsaw, Poland, with
Madness. We played there
many years back and were
given the equivalent of two
years' wages with which to
buy whatever we wanted.
But there was nothing on the
shelves; we went to this
music shop and all they had
was a tambourine, a
xylophone and a drum. I did
come back with a camera
and a paper cutter, though.
The trip was a real eye-
opener.
What was the worst show
you've ever played?
When 30 people turned up to
see us in Toronto, Canada.
ink the architects of the 60
The power went down, so we
played an acoustic set but
the crowd didn't like us and
we were booed off!
What's your favourite
colour?
Green, as in the bomber
jacket!
What's your favourite
breakfast cereal?
Porridge. I went to this Welsh
guesthouse once and they
served particularly nice
porridge - and haddock
poached in milk!
What's the strangest thing
you've ever eaten?
In Italy I ate a seafood pasta
with tiny crabs and a mini-
octopus in. Apparently they
were from the sea but it
didn't look like it! And when
we went to Japan, we went
to this restaurant where they
prepared fresh seafood
before our eyes.
Has anything bizarre
happened while you've
been recording with the
band?
The ﬁrst album was pretty
bizarre! We went to this
studio in Denmark and it was
in the middle of some ﬁelds
that were sprayed with
manure all the time. We had
to stay there for a month and
we used to wake up gasping
for air!
Which building would you
demolish?
60's high-rise ofﬁce blocks.
And a car showroom in
Camden Road. From where I
used to live, you always
though 'I could have a
panoramic view of London'. I
think most of the architects
of the 60
up and shot!
Have you ever used the
Yellow Pages?
The only time I did was to
ﬁnd someone to build me a
bike!
If you were a ﬂuffy animal,
which one would you be?
A cat, cos they're
independent and have such a
cushy life. A cat doesn't take
any stick from anyone.
Which animal would the
band be?
Obviously a bee. (Er, that
isn't an animal! Big Thrills
Ed).
Who would you most like
to meet?
I'd like to meet Brian Eno
[Obscure arty musician]. The
one other person I always
wanted to meet was David
Bowie. I met him and I
thought 'Isn't he short!'.
If you had a baseball bat,
who would you hit?
Wendy James [from
Transvision Vamp].
What's your greatest fear?
Losing a limb. I came close
to losing my hand when I was
eight. I put it through a pane
of glass in a door and
severed the nerve. I still can't
feel the tips of my ﬁngers.
What would be your idea of
perfect happiness?
To own a perfect, hand-built
carbon-ﬁbre-frame bike but
they're so expensive. My big
hope is that we crack it in
America...

RAINBOW DRIVE (18)
Rental•
'Daddy, what did you listen to in the 70's?'
Part II
Peter Weller, the man best known for
displaying his robot-like prowess in the
Robocop movies (as Robocop, stoopid),
displays his, er, robot-like prowess in this
V I D E O
average cop thriller - and he doesn't even
play a robot this time.
His headaches start when he discovers a mound
of dead bodies in a house in, wait for it, Rainbow
Drive. And when he gets back to work he ﬁnds that
not only do the powers that be refuse his requests to
snoop around, but they act mighty suspiciously and a
few of the facts of the killings go astray. It's all a bit
average really, Weller needs to loosen up and stop
creaking about as if he's been dipped in a big bowl of
starch, and there's not nearly enough action going
on.

Back in 1979, The Specials stormed the charts with their brand of
upbeat Two-Tone pop - full of rhythm, brass and corkingly good
tunes.
People in 'Pork-pie' hats and dark suits could be seen hopping
wildly to this sort of music and now those ever-so-nice people at
Chrysalis have released 'The Specials - Singles', a compilation of all their er, singles!
In their time, The Specials had seven Top Ten hits. That's more that Dannii Minogue has

DINOSAURS (U)
Rental
Cute teen lizards that wear 'hip'
clothes and spout Americanisms
like "dude" and 'radical"? Now if
that doesn't make you think of a
certain bunch of ninjas who eat
pizza and live down the sewers, where have
you been?
The turtles seem to have taken over all
aspects of life, and typically there's a
plethora of movies that aim to 'cash in' on
such success, but why ever the heck not?
The dinosaurs in question are a trio of
incredibly cool ("they're not cool, they're
cold blooded!" Groan) reptiles that live in an
alternate past (where cavemen follow a
leader called Mr. Big, and dinosaurs live in a
lovely city of they're own), and they get help
in saving Saur City from Mr. Big when a
group of American teens drop in on them
\Klan Ut3
from the future.
If you can stand American teen movies,
that's major joke seems to be how loud the
Neanderthals fart, you'll love this slice of
adventure in a fairly strange vein.

ROUND-UP (THE

interesting and very special (special

First out of the Bobby Charlton

There's more action than
