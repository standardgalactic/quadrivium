 MONITOR: It displays information   
 KEYBOARD: Device used to enter data and commands  
 MOUSE: A pointing device used to input commands only.  
 SYSTEM: House the CPU and other pieces of hardware. The CPU acts as the brain of computer 
which controls the operation the computer does.  
 
A computer is an electronic machine which process, stores and retrieves information 
in 
a desired manner or format. It is made up of two elements i.e. hardware and software.  
 
Computer = hardware + software 
 
 
 
 
Hardware 
 
 
 
 
 
These are physical parts of a computer. These can be seen and touched.  
For example:   
Keyboard, Mouse, Printer, Monitor, etc 
 
 
 
Software 
 
 
 
 
 
Refers to a set of instructions or programs that operates a computer e.g.  
Operating Software Computer hardware requires software to tell it what to do  
and how to do it. A computer consists of many, different types of software. 
Every software has a specific purpose in the computer. Computer software is 
in two types – Systems software (operating software) and Application 
Software, 
 
System software if the software the 
1. An Operating System Controls the hardware.

The functions of the CU are: 
1. Controlling operations of input/output (i/o) systems. 
2. Controlling flow of data within the processor and between the processor and the 
peripheral devices. 
3. Configuring and optimizing RAM to ensure that it works efficiently. 
The ALU performs the following function 
processing data by doing arithmetic and logic operations. 
- 
Arithmetic means addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
- 
Logic is comparing things so as to make appropriate choices. 
 
The CU and the ALU are made on the same computer chip called the Central Processing 
Unit (CPU) or the microprocessor. 
 
RAM is temporary storage. When power is switched off, everything is erased from RAM. 
The Functions of RAM is  
1. Receiving raw data from input. 
2. Receiving processed data from the ALU. 
3. Storing instructions required by the CU. 
4. Holding data awaiting output.

Classification of Computers  
  
Computers are classified in five classes whose differences can be attributed to a number of factors such 
as:  
• 
Their physical size  
• 
Their speed of processing data  
• 
Their memory capacity  
• 
Their storage capacity  
• 
Their cost of acquisition  
• 
Their hardware and software requirements  
• 
Their environmental requirements  
• 
Their ease of use  
  
The five categories of computers are:  
1. Microcomputers  
2. Servers  
3. Minicomputers  
4. Mainframe computers  
5. Supercomputers  
NOTE: Their largeness in physical sizes ranks according to the order they are outlined above. This means 
that the microcomputers are the smallest and the supercomputers are the largest in their physical sizes.   
 
1. Microcomputers  
 
These are single user computers because they are used by one user at a time. They are also 
often called personal computers (PCs) because of being single user.  They run programs 
designed to help individuals accomplish their work more productively. Microcomputers are the 
most widespread and popular because of a variety of reasons. These include:   
1. They are small in size, and therefore do not occupy large space.  E.g. 
laptops, are portable.  
2. They are not as costly as the other computers.  
3. They are easier to operate and maintain.  
4. They can operate in ordinary environments, i.e. they do not necessarily 
require highly controlled environments.  
  
Examples of microcomputers are:  
1. Desktop computers  
2. Laptop computers  
3. Notebook computers  

11

4. Netbook computers  
5. Palmtop computers  
6. Wearable computers  
  
3. Mini Computers  
 
Minicomputers are multi-user systems that can handle the computing needs of a smaller 
corporation or organization.  They are multi user because many people can use them 
simultaneously by means of remote terminals or personal computers. They are faster and have 
bigger storage than Micro computers 
 
 
 
 
4. Mainframe Computers 
 
Mainframes are huge, multi-user systems designed to handle massive processing jobs in large 
corporations or government ministries or departments. These were the earliest computers to be 
introduced. The first mainframe computers were very large; about the size of a classroom.

5. Super Computers 
 
Supercomputers are ultra-fast computers designed to process huge amounts of scientific data 
then display the underlying patterns that have been discovered. They are mainly used in research 
centres to help with the most advanced processing operations.  
 
 
  
 
6. Servers 
 
Servers are not designed to be used directly.  They make programs and data available for 
people hooked up to a computer network, a collection of computers connected together so that 
they can exchange data. As illustration below.

Health and Safety when Handling Computers 
Health  
 
In computers are not handle properly they can give rise to a lot of health problems. The 
following table highlights a number of health problem and possible solutions to either 
minimise the risk or eliminate it altogether.  
  
Health risk   
Solution  
Back and neck problems/strain  
1. use fully adjustable chairs to give the correct posture  
2. use foot rests to reduce posture problems  
3. use screens that can be tilted to ensure the neck is at 
the correct angle  
Repetitive strain injury (RSI) – 
damage to fingers and wrists  
1. ensure correct posture is maintained (i.e. correct angle 
of arms to the keyboard and mouse, for example)  
2. make proper use of a wrist rest when using a mouse or a 
keyboard  
3. take regular breaks and do some exercise  
Eyestrain (caused by staring at a 
computer screen too long or bad 
lighting in the room)  
1. ensure that there is no screen flicker, since this can lead 
to eye problems  
2. change to LCD screens where flicker is less of a problem 
than with CRT screens  
3. take regular breaks and try focusing on a point which is 
some distance away  
Headaches  
1. use an anti-glare screen or use window blinds to cut   
2. out light reflections – bad lighting can cause squinting 
and lead to headaches, etc.  
3. take regular breaks and do some exercise  
4. have eyes tested regularly and use middle-vision 
glasses if necessary 
Ozone irritation (dry  skin, 
respiratory problems, etc.) – this is 
caused by laser printers in an office 
area  
1. ensure proper ventilation to remove the ozone gas as 
quickly as possible  
2. house laser printers in a designated printer room  
3. change to other types of printer if necessary (e.g. inkjet 
printers)

Safety 
Apart from health issues use of computer can also give rise to a lot of safety problems. The 
following table gives a number of safety problems and possible solutions to eliminate or 
minimise the them.  
  
Safety hazards   
Ways of eliminating or minimising hazard  
Electrocution  
1. use of a residual circuit breaker (RCB)  
2. check insulation on wires regularly  
3. do not allow drinks near computers  
4. check equipment regularly  
Trailing wires (trip hazard)  
1. use cable ducts to make the wires safe  
2. cover wires and/or have them neatly tucked 
away  
(Under desks, etc.)  
3. try and use wireless connections wherever 
possible, thus eliminating cables altogether  
Heavy equipment falling  
1. use strong desk and tables to support heavy 
hardware  
2. use large desks and tables so that hardware 
isn’t too close to the edge where it can fall off  
Fire risk  
1. Have a fully tested CO2/dry fire extinguisher 
nearby (not water extinguishers!)  
2. don’t cover equipment vents, which can cause 
equipment to overheat  
3. make sure hardware is fully maintained  
4. ensure good ventilation in the room, again to 
stop  
overheating of hardware  
5. do not overload sockets with too many items  
6. change to low voltage hardware wherever 
possible (e.g. replace CRT monitors with LCD 
monitors)  
  
In summary health and safety issues can be checked and solved by considering some of the following 
good habits 
1. Ensure correct posture is maintained (i.e. Correct angle of arms to the keyboard 
and mouse, for example)  
2. Securing power cables and avoiding liquids and dust near computers.  
3. Sequence of powering up and down of various technologies (i.e. TVs, cell phone, 
printer, scanner   
4. Check insulation on wires regularly  
5. Do not allow drinks near computers  
6. Check equipment regularly  
7. Cover wires and/or have them neatly tucked away (under desks, etc.)  
8. Ensure good ventilation in the room, again to stop overheating of hardware  
9. Do not overload sockets with too many items

Care of Computers 
A computer is an ICT resource, therefore it important that its data and hardware are taken care of. 
 
 
ICT SECURITY  
  
These refer to the defence necessary to wade off threats imposed on ICT resources Basically, 
security is ensuring that resources are free from unauthorized internal and external manipulation  
 
Types of Security  
 
There are two types of security:  
 
1. DATA SECURITY  
This kind of security ensures that data, information and software are safe from 
internal and external.  
 
2. PHYSICAL SECURITY  
The one that ensures that all the various types of hardware are safe.  
 
Security Threats 
Some of the threats are as follows:  
1. Unauthorised access of individuals to data storage. 
2. Incorrect use of hardware and software, media or computer rooms.  
3. Unauthorised manipulation of data files or equipment.  
4. Theft of data or hardware.  
5. Fire/water.  
6. Environmental conditions, e.g. temperature and humidity. 
7. Viruses and other malicious code. 
Measures to Improve On Security 
1. Keeping all doors to computer rooms locked so that access is upon permission granted. 
2. Locking computers so that only personnel with computer keys can unlock and use them. 
3. Backing up all data and programs so that should the data and programs that are used become 
corrupt, backups can quickly be used 
4. Keeping data and program backups in a separate room which is also secured. 
5. Installing antivirus software and keeping it updated. 
6. Using passwords to start computers and to open files.  
Computer viruses 
A computer virus is a program that is meant to cause some kind of damage or discomfort when it is 
activated on an infected computer.   
 

17 
Global Impact Educational Multimedia: http://gicedumedia.blogspot.com 
Unlocking Distinctions Computer Studies Grade 8 Study Notes by B. Mwanza 
There are many ways in which a computer may become infected by a virus. Some of the common 
ones are as follows: 
1. Transferring data from removable storage media from one computer to another, e.g. 
floppies, CDs and flash disks. 
2. Through e-mail; when you receive and open an infected e-mail, your computer gets 
infected. 
3. Through downloads, e.g. of music, pictures, videos, documents and software on the 
Internet. 
Viruses however can be minimised by some of the following ways 
1. Ensure that your computer has latest versions of antivirus software. 
2. Always update the antivirus software from the Internet. 
3. Always scan your computer for viruses 
Safety when Turning On and Off the Computer  
  
When you're done using your computer, it's important to turn it off properly—not only to save 
energy, but also to ensure that your data is saved and to help keep your computer more secure. 
Best of all, your computer will start quickly the next time you use it.  To wake your computer or 
switch on, press the power button on your computer case the button usually is denoted with the 
symbol shown in the figures below. Remember also to switch on and off the monitor. When nothing 
comes on the screen sometimes it is because the monitor is off.  The following shows the symbols 
used for power buttons 
 
  
 
CONSEQUENCES OF THEFT OF COMPUTERS AND OTHER ICTs  
The consequences of theft of computers are in two ways:  
1. The victim of the theft can lose data, information and the property itself. This can be a very 
disturbing experience which can lead to more adverse effects.  
2. The thief can be arrested, punished and taken to court where he or she can be prosecuted 
and later jailed when proven guilty. 
Therefore, It’s important to protect computers with passwords because, In an event that the stolen 
computer has been protected with passwords, it becomes expensive to the thief to unlock it or else 
the computer is useless. 
Computer Peripherals 
A Computer peripheral is a piece of computer hardware that is added to a computer in order to expand 
its abilities. The term peripheral is used to describe those devices that are optional in nature, as 
opposed to hardware that is either demanded or always required in principle. There are all different 
kinds of peripherals you can add your computer. The main distinction among peripherals is the way 
they are connected to your computer. They can be connected internally or externally. 
The Printer 
A printer is a very popular peripheral device which is used for output by a computer. The three main 
types of printers are Dot matrix, Inkjet and Laser printer

Advantages of an Inkjet Printer 
1. Cheaper than a laser printer   
2. More compact than a laser printer   
3. Cartridges cost less to replace than toners   
4. Produce good quality printouts better than a dot-matrix but not as good as a laser   
5. Speed - faster than a dot-matrix but not as fast as a laser   
 
Disadvantages of an Inkjet Printer 
1. Noisier than a laser printer (but not as noisy as a dot-matrix)   
2. Colour printing can be extremely slow   
3. Cost of printouts per page are more expensive than a laser printer   
4. Cartridges need to be replaced more often than a laser printer   
5. Ink will smudge while it is still wet   
6. Colours can become saturated and often don't look the same as on the screen   
7. If not used for a while, the cartridges can dry out   
 
3. Laser jet Printer 
A laser printer is a popular type of personal computer printer that uses a non-impact (keys 
don't strike the paper), photocopier technology. When a document is sent to the printer, a 
laser beam "draws" the document on a selenium-coated drum using electrical charges. After 
the drum is charged, it is rolled in toner, a dry powder type of ink. The toner adheres to the 
charged image on the drum. The toner is transferred onto a piece of paper and fused to the 
paper with heat and pressure. After the document is printed, the electrical charge is removed 
from the drum and the excess toner is collected. Most laser printers print only in monochrome. 
A color laser printer is up to 10 times more expensive than a monochrome laser printer. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Advantages   
1. High quality printouts - better than ink-jet or dot-matrix   
2. Fast printouts - faster than ink-jet or dot-matrix   
3. Prints very quietly - quieter than ink-jet or dot-matrix   
4. Cost per page is low - cheaper than ink-jet or dotmatrix   
 
 
Disadvantages   
1. Most expensive printer type to buy, especially colour lasers   
2. Toner is more expensive than ink-jet cartridges   
3. Expensive to repair - lots of complex equipment inside   
4. Fairly bulky - larger than ink-jet printers   
5. Can't use continuous or multi-part stationary to create carbon copies like you can 
with a dot-matrix printer

4. Plotters 
 
The plotter is a computer printer for printing vector graphics. In the past, plotters were used 
in applications such as computer-aided design. 
 
They are a specialist type of printer which are   able to draw high quality images on very 
large pieces of paper.   
 
Uses of plotters:  
  
Plotters are used by engineers, architects and map-makers to draw plans of buildings, 
diagrams of machines or large scale maps.   
Advantages   
1. Drawings are of the same quality as if an expert drew them   
2. Larger sizes of paper can be used than most printers can manage 
 
Disadvantages   
• 
Plotters are slower than printers because each line is drawn separately

User Interfaces of Computers 
In computer science and human-computer interaction, the user interface (of a computer program) 
refers to the graphical, textual and auditory information the program presents to the user. The user 
employs several control sequences (such as keystrokes with the computer keyboard, movements of 
the computer mouse, or selections with the touchscreen) to control the program. 
There exist several types of user interfaces. We here give you just two examples: 
1. Command-Line Interface (CLI): The user provides the input by typing a command string 
with the computer keyboard and the system provides output by printing text on the 
computer monitor. 
 
 
Advantages 
1. 
Requires fewer resources. 
2. 
Concise and powerful. 
3. 
‘Expert’ – friendly. 
4. 
Easier to automate via scripting. 
5. 
Cons 
 
Disadvantages 
1. 
Commands not obvious. 
2. 
Not visually rich. 
3. 
‘Beginner’ – unfriendly. 
 
2. Graphical User Interface (GUI): The use of pictures rather than just words to represent 
the input and output of a program. Input is accepted via devices such as keyboard and 
mouse.

How does a GUI work? 
 
A GUI uses windows, icons, and menus to carry out commands, such as opening, 
deleting, and moving files. Although many GUI operating systems are navigated through 
the use of a mouse, the keyboard can also be utilized by using keyboard shortcuts or 
arrow keys. 
 
Advantages 
1. Eye-Appealing 
2. Easy to Use 
3. Time-Saver 
 
Disadvantages 
1. Greater requirement of resources 
2. Automation is difficult. 
3. Restricted Access.  
 
Working with the mouse in the GUI 
 
The computer mouse is a tool designed to help you use your computer. The majority of 
mice look similar to the following image but they are also available as tracker balls or 
joysticks. Some people prefer to use the keyboard instead. 
 
The computer mouse is rolled across a flat surface. This moves a pointer or text cursor 
around the screen. Mouse functions include click, double click and drag. 
 
The mouse pointer on the screen has lots of different shapes depending on what it is 
pointing at. If you are keying in text it will look like a large letter I. If you are selecting 
commands from the tool bar or drop down menus it will look like an arrow. Some 
commonly seen pointer shapes are shown in the image below. 
 
 
 

23 
Global Impact Educational Multimedia: http://gicedumedia.blogspot.com 
Unlocking Distinctions Computer Studies Grade 8 Study Notes by B. Mwanza 
Holding the mouse    
 
use which ever hand feels most comfortable*. If you use your right hand place it over the 
mouse, hold it lightly between your thumb and ring or little finger with your index finger 
over the left button, and your middle finger over on the right button. You will probably use 
the left button more often than the right. 
 
*Note: You can use the mouse with your left hand. You use your middle finger for left 
clicks and index finger for right clicks. Alternatively, the function of the buttons can be 
swapped by using controls on the computer. 
 
Click and Double Click 
 
these are actions which make something happen. To single click, press the left mouse 
button lightly and release it immediately. To double click, press the left button twice in 
quick succession. You will use a single left click to select a task from a menu or to use a 
tool on the toolbar. You will use a double click to open a programme. 
 
The pointer will change shape depending on what it is pointing at. For example, when 
you are looking at a webpage (this is known in computer language as browsing), you will 
see the pointer change to a pointing finger symbol like this as you move it over the page. 
This means there is an action; in this case it has recognised a link to another webpage 
(known in computer language as a hyperlink) and if you click the left mouse button once, 
the other page will open. 
 
Right-Click. The right click can be used as a short cut to open an option menu. 
 
Click, hold and drag: click once, hold the button down and roll the mouse to drag 
movable items across the screen. 
 
Wheel. A mouse will often have a small wheel between the buttons. When you roll this 
wheel, the page will move up or down in computer language this is known as scrolling)

Computer Based Learning in education  
Computer-based learning is a term that can be used to describe virtually any kind of learning 
program using computers as a central staple. In other words, it refers to the use of computers 
as a key component of the educational environment.  
There are various merits of using computer-based learning programs in education, these 
including:  
 the ability for pupils to learn from their homes and study without the assistance of an 
instructor(teacher)  
 Allowing pupils to research for their study materials, e.g. use of electronic 
encyclopaedias and the Internet.  
 Communication with teachers, sponsors, parents and friends through E-mail other 
means  
 Production of learning resources, e.g. notes and assignments.  
 The saying “practice makes perfect” becomes a reality with use of ICT because 
learners are able to practice a skill, or listen or watch a presentation many times at 
their own pace, place and time.  
 Storing of school documents for administrative purposes.  
  
Social Impacts of computers  
The effects of computers socially are that it has changed the way people communicate with 
one another and the way people perform work. Computers and the use of the Internet changed 
the world in many ways socially and economically NEGATIVELY,   
 Harmful to learners instead of learning they are busy chatting.  
 Contribute to moral decay.  
 The quality of work goes down because of “too much information available”, especially 
on the web.  
 Cases of plagiarism (i.e. intellectual theft) and piracy become on the increase.   
On the positive side computers enhance social interactions and communication among people 
 Computers are also used in production of sound/songs, videos E.G mixture of tones 
and video clips  
 For social networking E.G E-mail, downloading, face book, what’s up.

Working with Microsoft Windows Operating System 
1. Desktop 
 
Desktop The desktop is the area that appears right after logging in. It contains a background 
picture (wallpaper), icons and the taskbar. 
 
 
On the desktop are pictures with text labels under them, these pictures are called icons 
because they represent something else. 
 
If you move or get rid of an icon, all that means is that you have to access what they represent 
a different way, you haven’t gotten rid of the application software the icon is representing. Icons 
usually represent programs, but sometimes they represent collections of data. Double-clicking 
(clicking twice in rapid succession) on one of these icons will open whatever it represents, the 
text tells you what it represents.

Unlocking Distinctions Computer Studies Grade 8 Study Notes by B. Mwanza 
Icons are tiny pictures that represents a program, folder, or program function. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Taskbar 
 
There is a bar that is usually at the bottom of the desktop, however it may also be on any 
other side. If you cannot see it, then move the cursor to the edge where it is and it will 
come up. It is called the task-bar. 
 
The taskbar is the bar along one side of the desktop. It is used for launching programs 
or opening the window of an open program. 
 
 
 
Along the main part of the task-bar is a list of all open programs, clicking on one element 
of this list will put that program’s window (the box that a program is viewed in) on top of 
all other open windows. Over on one side of the task-bar is a clock; beside the clock are 
a bunch of icons that represent open ‘invisible’ programs. These are programs that are 
always running and do things ‘behind the scenes’. This area is called the system tray. 
On the main part of the task-bar there is sometimes a small group of icons, this is called 
the quick-launch bar. Clicking on one of these icons opens whatever it represents. 
 
2. System Tray  
 
The system tray holds icons for programs currently running ‘behind-the-scenes’. On the 
opposite side of the task-bar from the clock and the system tray is a button.  
 
A button (or command button) is just like a real button, when it is pushed (clicked) it does 
something. Some buttons have text on them that say what they do, and some have icons 
representing what they do. Some have both. 
 
 
 
3. (Command) Buttons 
 
These buttons do something when you click on them. They may be labeled by text, an icon, or 
both. 

31 
Global Impact Educational Multimedia: http://gicedumedia.blogspot.com 
Unlocking Distinctions Computer Studies Grade 8 Study Notes by B. Mwanza 
 
The quick-launch icons are also buttons. Some buttons are raised to look like real buttons and 
some only raise up when you hover (put the cursor on top of) them. The button on the other 
side of the start-bar from the clock and system tray is called the start-button. When you click the 
start-button it opens the start-menu. The start-menu has icons for more programs and data 
collections, although it is usually programs. 
 
4. Start button  
 
The Start button is a button that opens the start-menu. 
 
 
Start menu The Start menu contains icons for all installed programs and data collections, usually for 
programs. 
 
 
 
 
The icons that are on the desktop, the quick-launch bar, and the start-menu are usually shortcuts. On 
the desktop shortcuts are often indicated by a small symbol on top of the icon 
(WindowsShortcutArrow.png). Shortcuts are what I meant earlier when I said ‘if you move or get rid 
of an icon, all that means is that you have to access what they represent a different way, you haven’t 
gotten rid of the actual thing’. Icons represent all data collections and programs even if they are not 
shortcuts, however normally the ones on the desktop and in the start-menu are shortcuts. 
Shortcuts Icons that are only links to the things those icons represent.

Working with Windows OS Applications 
An application—also known as a program—is a type of software that allows you to complete tasks on 
your computer. Windows comes with many built-in applications you can use. For example, if you want to 
browse the Internet, you can use Internet Explorer, the built-in web browser for Windows. 
 
 
 
To open an application (Windows 7 and earlier): 
 
 
 
Using your mouse, click the Start button, then select the desired application. If you don't see the one 
you want, click All Programs to see a complete list of applications. In our example, we'll open Internet 
Explorer.

Working with windows 
Whenever you open a file, folder, or application, it will appear in a new window. You can have 
multiple items open at the same time in different windows. You'll use windows all the time, so 
it's important to know how to switch between open windows, how to move and resize windows, 
and how to close windows when you're done using them. 
 
In Windows 8, some programs will open on the Start screen, not the desktop. If you're using 
Windows 8, note that the information below applies only to windows you have opened on the 
desktop. 
 
Parts of a window 
You'll see the same three buttons in the upper-right corner of almost every window. These 
buttons allow you to: 
 
 Minimize: Click here to hide the window. The window will be minimized to the 
taskbar. You can then click the icon for that window on the taskbar to make it reappear. 
 
 Maximize: Click here to make the window fill the entire screen. The Maximize 
button will be temporarily replaced by the Restore button 
. Just click it to return the 
window to its original size. 
 
 Close: Click here to close the window. 
 
To move a window: 
1. Click and drag the top of the window to move it to the desired location on the screen. When 
you're done, release the mouse. 
 
The window will appear in the new location.

To resize a window: 
1. Hover the mouse over any corner of the window, then click and drag the mouse to make 
the window larger or smaller. When you're done, release the mouse. 
2. The window will be resized. 
Switching between windows 
If you have more than one window open at the same time, you can quickly switch between 
them by clicking the icon for that window on the taskbar. 
 
Shutting down your computer 
When you're done using your computer, it's important to shut it down properly. The procedure 
will vary slightly depending on which version of Windows you're using. To shut down your 
computer (Windows 7 and earlier): 
 
Click the Start button, then select Shut down (in some versions, this may say Turn Off 
Computer or look like the power symbol power symbol).

Restarting and Sleep mode 
 
You can also click the arrow to the right of the Shutdown button for more options. For example, 
if your computer has become unresponsive, you can choose Restart to quickly turn it off and on 
again. 
 
You can also choose to put your computer into Sleep mode. This turns off most of your 
computer's processes, but it remembers which applications and files are open. It allows the 
computer to start up more quickly because you won't have to wait for the operating system and 
applications to load. Note that your computer may go into Sleep mode automatically if you 
haven't used it for more than a few minutes. 
 
If you have a laptop computer, you can simply close the lid to put it into Sleep mode. 
 
If your computer is in Sleep mode, you'll need to wake it to use it. To wake the computer from 
Sleep mode, click the mouse or press any key on the keyboard.     
 
Word Processing 
  
Word processing is the creation, retrieval, changing, storage and printing text (letters, numbers and 
symbols) using a computer. In support, a computer may be defined as an electronic device that process 
data, accept, retrieve, store and outputs data at a high speed according to a programmed instruction.  
 
Therefore, Microsoft Word is one of the programme packages run on a computer and it can be used to 
type letters, reports, and other documents. Furthermore, you can use word to perform some of the 
following tasks: 
• 
Create and save a document (permanent).  
• 
Format a document for different presentations.  
• 
Print the document.  
• 
Prepare flyers, brochures, long documents.  
• 
Word-processing versus paper work. 
 
Microsoft Word 
 
1. The Word interface 
 
When you open Word for the first time, the Start Screen will appear. From here, you'll be able to create 
a new document, choose a template, and access your recently edited documents. From the Start 
Screen, locate and select Blank document to access the Word interface.

The following is the basic representation of the Microsoft Word (Version 2016) interface 
 
 
 
 
Working with the Word environment 
 
Like other recent versions, Word 2016 continues to use features like the Ribbon and the Quick 
Access Toolbar—where you will find commands to perform common tasks in Word—as well as 
Backstage view. 
 
1. The Ribbon 
 
Word uses a tabbed Ribbon system instead of traditional menus. The Ribbon contains 
multiple tabs, which you can find near the top of the Word window. 
 
 
 

37 
Global Impact Educational Multimedia: http://gicedumedia.blogspot.com 
Unlocking Distinctions Computer Studies Grade 8 Study Notes by B. Mwanza 
 
Each tab contains several groups of related commands. For example, the Font group on 
the Home tab contains commands for formatting text in your document. 
 
 
 
Some groups also have a small arrow in the bottom-right corner that you can click for even 
more options. 
 
 
 
Showing and hiding the Ribbon 
 
If you find that the Ribbon takes up too much screen space, you can hide it. To do this, click 
the Ribbon Display Options arrow in the upper-right corner of the Ribbon, then select the 
desired option from the drop-down menu: 
 
 
 
 
Auto-hide Ribbon: Auto-hide displays your document in full-screen mode and completely 
hides the Ribbon from view. To show the Ribbon, click the Expand Ribbon command at the 
top of screen.

Global Impact Educational Multimedia: http://gicedumedia.blogspot.com 
Unlocking Distinctions Computer Studies Grade 8 Study Notes by B. Mwanza 
Show Tabs: This option hides all command groups when they're not in use, but tabs will 
remain visible. To show the Ribbon, simply click a tab. 
 
Show Tabs and Commands: This option maximizes the Ribbon. All of the tabs and 
commands will be visible. This option is selected by default when you open Word for the 
first time. 
To learn how to add custom tabs and commands to the Ribbon, review our Extra on 
Customizing the Ribbon. 
 
The Quick Access Toolbar 
 
Located just above the Ribbon, the Quick Access Toolbar lets you access common 
commands no matter which tab is selected. By default, it shows the Save, Undo, and Redo 
commands, but you can add other commands depending on your needs. 
 
To add commands to the Quick Access Toolbar: Click the drop-down arrow to the right of 
the Quick Access Toolbar. 
 
 
 
Select the command you want to add from the menu. The command will be added to the 
Quick Access Toolbar. 
 
Document views and zooming 
 
Word has a variety of viewing options that change how your document is displayed. You 
can choose to view your document in Read Mode, Print Layout, or Web Layout. These 
views can be useful for various tasks, especially if you're planning to print the document. 
You can also zoom in and out to make your document easier to read. 
 
Switching document views 
 
Switching between different document views is easy. Just locate and select the desired

Excel is a spreadsheet program that allows you to store, organize, and analyse information. While you 
may believe Excel is only used by certain people to process complicated data, anyone can learn how to 
take advantage of the program's powerful features. Whether you're keeping a budget, organizing a 
training log, or creating an invoice, Excel makes it easy to work with different types of data. 
 
 
The Excel interface 
When you open Excel 2016 for the first time, the Excel Start Screen will appear. From here, you'll be able 
to create a new workbook, choose a template, and access your recently edited workbooks. From the 
Excel Start Screen, locate and select Blank workbook to access the Excel interface. 
 
 
Excel 2016 uses a tabbed Ribbon system instead of traditional menus. The Ribbon contains 
multiple tabs, each with several groups of commands. You will use these tabs to perform the 
most common tasks in Excel. 
 
Some groups will have an arrow you can click for more options.

Workbooks and Worksheets 
Excel files are called workbooks. Whenever you start a new project in Excel, you'll need to create a new 
workbook. There are several ways to start working with a workbook in Excel. You can choose to create 
a new workbook—either with a blank workbook or a predesigned template—or open an existing 
workbook. 
 
To create a new blank workbook: 
1. Select the File Tab. Backstage view will appear.

4. If you've opened the desired workbook recently, you can browse your Recent Workbooks rather 
than search for the file. 
 
 
 
 
Worksheets 
 
Every workbook contains at least one worksheet by default. When working with a large amount of data, 
you can create multiple worksheets to help organize your workbook and make it easier to find content. 
You can also group worksheets to quickly add information to multiple worksheets at the same time. 
 
To insert a new worksheet 
1. Locate and select the New sheet button near the bottom-right corner of the Excel window. 
 
 
 

57 
Global Impact Educational Multimedia: http://gicedumedia.blogspot.com 
Unlocking Distinctions Computer Studies Grade 8 Study Notes by B. Mwanza 
2. A new blank worksheet will appear. 
 
 
 
By default, any new workbook you create in Excel will contain one worksheet, called Sheet1. To 
change the default number of worksheets, navigate to Backstage view, click Options, then 
choose the desired number of worksheets to include in each new workbook. 
 
Excel Cells 
Whenever you work with Excel, you'll enter information—or content—into cells. Cells are the basic 
building blocks of a worksheet. You'll need to learn the basics of cells and cell content to calculate, 
analyze, and organize data in Excel. 
 
Understanding cells 
 
Every worksheet is made up of thousands of rectangles, which are called cells. A cell is the intersection 
of a row and a column—in other words, where a row and column meet. 
 
Columns are identified by letters (A, B, C), while rows are identified by numbers (1, 2, 3). Each cell has 
its own name—or cell address—based on its column and row. In the example below, the selected cell 
intersects column C and row 5, so the cell address is C5.

58 
Global Impact Educational Multimedia: http://gicedumedia.blogspot.com 
Unlocking Distinctions Computer Studies Grade 8 Study Notes by B. Mwanza 
 
Note that the cell address also appears in the Name box in the top-left corner, and that a cell's column 
and row headings are highlighted when the cell is selected. 
 
You can also select multiple cells at the same time. A group of cells is known as a cell range. Rather 
than a single cell address, you will refer to a cell range using the cell addresses of the first and last cells 
in the cell range, separated by a colon. For example, a cell range that included cells A1, A2, A3, A4, and 
A5 would be written as A1:A5. Take a look at the different cell ranges below: 
 
1. Cell range A1:A8 
 
 
 
2. Cell range A1:F1 
 
 
 
If the columns in your spreadsheet are labelled with numbers instead of letters, you'll need to 
change the default reference style for Excel. Review our Extra on What are Reference Styles? to 
learn how. 
 
To select a cell 
 
To input or edit cell content, you'll first need to select the cell. 
 
Click a cell to select it. In our example, we'll select cell D9. 

59 
Global Impact Educational Multimedia: http://gicedumedia.blogspot.com 
Unlocking Distinctions Computer Studies Grade 8 Study Notes by B. Mwanza 
A border will appear around the selected cell, and the column heading and row heading will be 
highlighted. The cell will remain selected until you click another cell in the worksheet. 
 
 
You can also select cells using the arrow keys on your keyboard. 
 
To select a cell range: 
 
Sometimes you may want to select a larger group of cells, or a cell range. 
 
Click and drag the mouse until all of the adjoining cells you want to select are highlighted. In our 
example, we'll select the cell range B5:C18. 
Release the mouse to select the desired cell range. The cells will remain selected until you click 
another cell in the worksheet.

Cell content 
 
Any information you enter into a spreadsheet will be stored in a cell. Each cell can contain different 
types of content, including text, formatting, formulas, and functions. 
 
Text: Cells can contain text, such as letters, numbers, and dates. 
 
 
Formatting attributes: Cells can contain formatting attributes that change the way letters, numbers, and 
dates are displayed.  
For example, percentages can appear as 0.15 or 15%. You can even change a cell's text or background 
color. 
 
 
 
Formulas and functions 
 
Cells can contain formulas and functions that calculate cell values. In our example, SUM(B2:B8) adds 
the value of each cell in the cell range B2:B8 and displays the total in cell B9.

Helpful Notes On Excel 
Excel is a spreadsheet software. Other examples of spreadsheet software are 
Microsoft Excel, Lotus 1.2.3, Quattro pro, SuperCalc, Symphony 2.  
 
The advantages of a spreadsheet over a manual worksheet are as follows:  
1. Data can be easily be edited.  
2. Calculations can be done easily.  
3. Charts can be created easily.  
4. Documents similar to those that can be created with a word processor can be done.  
Cells 
- 
A cell is a box in which we enter data and formula. It is identified by its address which is formed by 
the intersecting column letter and row number.  
- 
The appearance of the cell contents can be modified by using the spreadsheet format commands. 
- 
Each cell may contain anyone of the following:  label, number, date or time, formula or function 
Charts  
- 
The Chart feature allows us to visualize the data in pictorial form.  
 
Excel Formulas and Functions  
- 
Formulas are mathematical expressions that we create in Excel. All Formulas begin with the = 
symbol  
- 
All Formulas use the following mathematical operators ( +, / , * , _ )  
- 
Functions are mathematical expressions that are already available in Excel. Example of functions: 
SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN, etc.,  
 
 Common Errors in Microsoft Excel 
 
  
#NAME?  
This error means a Function used is not being recognize by Excel. 
  
####   
A number in a cell is too wide for the cell to display it.  or The formula in the cell produces a result 
that is too wide for the cell.  Or There is a negative number in the cell that has been formatted for 
dates or times. To overcome this we can increase the column width.  
  
#REF! 
 This means a non-valid reference in your formula. Often occurs as the result of deleting rows, 
columns, cells or   Worksheets.  
  
#DIV/0!  
It means you cannot divide zero into a number.  
  
Copying 
  
To Copy the formula from one cell to other cells. Highlight the cell to copy the formula in it and then paste 
it to desired cells

PUBLISHING SOFTWARE  
  
Learning Outcomes 
 Publishing basics and Features 
 Pre-designed layouts or Templates 
 Elementary Graphics 
 Colours and Fonts 
 Clip art/Re-designed graphics 
 
Desktop publishing software is software which is used to generate layouts and produce typographic 
quality text and images better than traditional typography and printing. This technology allows 
individuals, businesses, and other organizations to self-publish a wide range of printed matter. Desktop 
publishing is also the main reference for digital typography. When used skillfully, desktop publishing 
allows the user to produce a wide variety of materials, from menus to magazines and books, without the 
expense of commercial printing. 
 
Microsoft Publisher 
Microsoft Publisher a program designed to help you create publications, or documents that you can print 
and distribute. 
Even if you've never used Publisher before, you'll probably find its interface familiar, as it has many of the 
same features as other Microsoft Office programs. However, it does include some features specifically 
designed for creating publications. 
Advantages and disadvantages of Publisher 
Publisher offers templates and other tools to help you create a variety of publications, including 
brochures, newsletters, business cards, and menus. 
 
 
As you might know, you can do most—if not all—of the tasks mentioned above in Microsoft Word. 
So why not create publications using that program instead? 
One of the advantages of Publisher is that it offers more control over certain aspects of your 
publication. For instance, Publisher offers a work environment that makes it easy to work with

documents in a variety of sizes and shapes. It also has a larger variety of tools to help you arrange 
and align text, images, and other objects within the page margins. 
 
However, while Publisher does have certain advantages, it also has the disadvantage of being 
the least developed program in the Office suite. It does not include the theme colors, advanced 
image editing tools, or many of the other new features present in Word and PowerPoint 2010. In 
fact, in terms of these features Publisher 2010 is more similar to Publisher 2007 and 2003 than it 
is to other current programs in the Office suite. As you begin to use Publisher 2010, you may find 
that you prefer to create certain types of publications in Word. 
Microsoft Publisher Interface 
The Ribbon

appear on the printed page. When you select an object in your publication, a white 
space will appear on the rulers to show the object's location.

Microsoft Publisher Working with Text 
 
To create and design effective publications, you need to be able to present text in a readable and visually 
interesting way. For this reason, Publisher offers a number of tools that let you customize and control the 
layout and appearance of the text in your publication. 
Formatting text 
Publisher 2010 includes various typography commands that are designed to help you embellish your text. 
Although Publisher's developers have touted this as a significant feature, it's important to note that many 
of these effects only work with a small number of fonts, such as Calibri, Cambria, and Gabriola. Still, if 
you're using these fonts the typography commands can enhance the appearance of your text. 
Typography commands can be found in the Text Box Tools tab. To apply any command, simply select 
your text, then click the desired command. Certain commands, like Stylistic Sets, will include a drop-down 
list of choices.

2. Number Style, which lets you choose between four different styles for number spacing and 
alignment 
 
 
3. Ligatures, which connect certain combinations of letters to make them easier to read

In Publisher, the components of any publication are called objects. You've already worked with text boxes, 
which are one type of object. Publisher offers decorative objects as well, including shapes and Building 
Blocks. 
Pictures are a great way to add visual interest to your publication. Depending on the type of publication 
you're creating, adding pictures can even be essential. For instance, you wouldn't create a brochure for a 
product without including at least one picture of it. The picture tools in Publisher 2010 make it easy to 
incorporate images into your documents and modify those images in interesting ways.

What is a computer network?  
A computer network is an interconnection of computers which allows computers to exchange 
data. It is also called data network. It is a link between two or more computers.  
 
A network is simply a collection of computers or other hardware devices that are connected 
together, either physically or logically, using special hardware and software, to allow them to 
exchange information and cooperate.  
 
Networking is the term that describes the processes involved in designing, implementing, 
upgrading, managing and otherwise working with networks and network technologies.  
 
Reasons for networking computers?  
 
1. To share data  
For example, a centralized database can be used to store all the records of an organization. The 
same data in the database can be accessed by everyone. 
 
2. To sharing tasks co - workers 
Co-workers can collaborate on tasks to speed up processing. 
 
3. Increasing Storage Capacity:  
 
As there is more than one computer on a network which can easily share files, thereby 
increasing the storage available for an organisation 
 
4. Reduction in costs by sharing hardware and software resources e.g. Printers

Wireless and Wired Network.  
  
Wireless Network. 
  
In simple terms it is the connection between two or more devices without cables. Networks 
do not use any form of cables. The transmission of data (your files, music, printing to the 
printer, etc.) occurs over radio waves. The following are the examples of wireless network 
devices:   
i. 
Radio   
ii. 
Mobile phone  
iii. 
Television Set Etc.  
 
Wired Network.  
 
This simply means the connection between two or more devices via cables. Examples of wired 
network devices are:   
i. 
Telephone  
ii. 
Cable television  
iii. 
Fiber-optic etc.  
 
How can computers be linked?  
 
There are many ways in which computers can be networked. The type of computer network formed is 
generally determined by the distance which the network will cover. On the basis of distance, there are 
three basic computer networks:  
1. Local Area Network (LAN)  
2. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)  
3. Wide Area Network (WAN)  
 
The Lan  
 
A LAN is an interconnection of computers within the same place/building.   
 
MAN 
 
A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a computer network that interconnects users with 
computer resources in a geographic area or region such as a city or institution. MAN is simply 
a connection of LAN within a relatively large geographical region. 
 
Wide Area Network (Wan)  
 
Wide Area Network (WAN) connects computer at wide distance across 
geographical boundaries such as Cities, countries and the continents.
