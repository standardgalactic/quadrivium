Preface
L___________________________________________________________________________________________________ J
It is with great pleasure that we offer the eleventh edition of Intermediate Algebra. We have 
remained true to the original goal that has guided us over the years—to provide the best 
possible text and supplements package to help students succeed and instructors teach. 
This edition faithfully continues that process through enhanced explanations of concepts, 
new and updated examples and exercises, student-oriented features like Pointers, Cautions, 
Problem-Solving Hints, Margin Problems, and Study Skills, as well as an extensive package 
of helpful supplements and study aids.
This text is part of a series that also includes the following books:
• Basic College Mathematics, Tenth Edition, by Lial, Salzman, and Hestwood
• Prealgebra, Sixth Edition, by Lial and Hestwood
• Introductory Algebra, Eleventh Edition, by Lial, Hornsby, and McGinnis
• Introductory and Intermediate Algebra, Sixth Edition, by Lial, Hornsby, and McGinnis
• Developmental Mathematics: Basic Mathematics and Algebra, Fourth Edition, by Lial, 
Hornsby, McGinnis, Salzman, and Hestwood
WHAT'S NEW IN THIS EDITION
We are pleased to offer the following new text features and supplements.
► Revised Exposition 
With each edition of the text, we continue to polish and improve 
discussions and presentations of topics to increase readability and student understanding. 
We believe this edition is the best yet in this regard.
► More Figures and Diagrams For visual learners, we have made a concerted effort to 
add mathematical figures, diagrams, tables, and graphs whenever possible.
► Enhanced Use of Pedagogical Color We have thoroughly reviewed all pedagogical color 
in discussions and examples and increased its use wherever doing so would enhance 
concept development, emphasize important steps, or highlight key information.
► Improved Study Skills Most of these special activities now include a Now Try This section 
to increase student involvement. Each is designed independently to allow flexible use with 
individuals or small groups of students, or as a source of material for in-class discussions.
► More What Went Wrong? Exercises 
We have increased the number of these popular 
CONCEPT CHECK exercises, which highlight common student errors.
► More Relating Concepts Exercises 
We have increased the number of these flexible 
groups of exercises, located at the end of many exercise sets. Specially written to help 
students tie concepts together, as well as compare and contrast ideas, identify and describe 
patterns, and extend concepts to new situations, these sets of problems may be used with 
individual students or collaboratively with pairs or small groups. All of these exercise 
sets have been added to MyMathLab and tagged for easy location and assignment.
► Dedicated Mixed Review Exercises 
Each chapter review has been expanded to include 
a one-page set of Mixed Review Exercises to help students further synthesize concepts.
► Learning Catalytics 
This interactive student response tool uses students’ own devices 
to engage them in the learning process. Learning Catalytics is accessible through 
MyMathLab and can be customized to an instructor’s specific needs. Instructors can 
employ this tool to generate class discussion, promote peer-to-peer learning, and use 
real-time data to adjust instructional strategy. As an introduction to this exciting new tool, 
we have provided prerequisite skills questions at the beginning of each section to check 
students’ preparedness for the new section. Learn more about Learning Catalytics in the 
Instructor Resources tab in MyMathLab.

v iii Preface
► Enhanced MyMathLab Resources 
Exercise coverage has been refined with new videos 
and homework problems, including new Relating Concepts questions added throughout 
the course. See pages x and xi for more details.
► Data Analytics 
We analyzed aggregated student usage and performance data from 
MyMathLab for the previous edition of this text. The results of this analysis helped us 
improve the quality and quantity of exercises that matter the most to instructors and students.
CONTENT CHANGES
Specific content changes include the following:
► Exercise sets have been updated with a renewed focus on conceptual understanding, skill 
development, and review. New or revised figures are included wherever possible.
► Real-world data in the examples and exercises has been updated.
► Sections 1.4, 2.3, and 4.3 include new problem-solving objectives, examples, exercises, 
and/or hints. Section 1.2 provides new formulas from the health care industry.
► The presentation on linear equations in two variables in Section 3.1 has been reorga­
nized. New exercises have been added in Sections 3.1-3.3 to make better connections 
among tables, equations, and graphs of linear equations.
► The introduction to relations and functions in Section 3.5 has a new example and 
expanded discussion on relations and ordered pairs.
► Scientific notation is covered separately in Section 5.2.
► Increased connections between operations with rational numbers and operations 
with rational expressions are made in Sections 7.1-7.3.
► The following topics are among those that have been enhanced and/or expanded:
Solving linear equations in one variable with fraction and decimal coefficients (Section 1.1) 
Graphing linear inequalities in two variables (Section 3.4)
Solving systems of linear equations in three variables (Section 4.2)

HALLMARK FEATURES
We have enhanced the following popular features, each of which is designed to increase ease 
of use by students and/or instructors.
Emphasis on Problem-Solving We introduce our six-step problem-solving method in 
Chapter 1 and integrate it throughout the text. The six steps, Read, Assign a Variable, 
Write an Equation, Solve, State the Answer, and Check, are emphasized in boldface 
type and repeated in examples and exercises to reinforce the problem-solving process
for students. We also provide students with 
helpful problem-solving tips and strategies.

Preface IX
► Helpful Learning Objectives 
We begin each section with clearly stated, numbered 
objectives, and the included material is directly keyed to these objectives so that students 
and instructors know exactly what is covered in each section.
Popular Cautions and Notes 
One of the most popular features of previous editions, we 
include information marked O  CAUTION and 
Note 
to warn students about com­
mon errors and emphasize important ideas throughout the exposition. The updated text 
design makes them easy to spot.
► Comprehensive Examples The new edition features a multitude of step-by-step, 
worked-out examples that include pedagogical color, helpful side comments, and special 
pointers. We give special attention to checking example solutions—more checks, desig­
nated using a special CHECK tag and / ,  are included than in past editions.
► Guided Solutions 
Selected exercises in the margins and in the exercise sets, marked 
with a $  icon, show the first few solution steps. Many of these exercises can be found in 
the MyMathLab homework, providing guidance to students as they start learning a new 
concept or procedure.
► More Pointers 
Because they were so well received by both students and instructors in 
the previous edition, we incorporate more pointers in examples and discussions through­
out this edition of the text. They provide students with important on-the-spot reminders 
and warnings about common pitfalls.
► Ample Margin Problems 
Margin problems, with answers immediately available at the 
bottom of the page, are found in every section of the text. This key feature allows students 
to immediately practice the material covered in the examples in preparation for the exer­
cise sets. Many include guided solutions.
► Updated Figures, Photos, and Hand-Drawn Graphs 
Today’s students are more visu­
ally oriented than ever. As a result, we include appealing mathematical figures, diagrams, 
tables, and graphs, including a “hand-drawn” style of graphs, whenever possible. We 
have incorporated depictions of well-known mathematicians as well as photos to accom­
pany applications in examples and exercises.
► Relevant Real-Life Applications 
We include many new or updated applications from 
fields such as business, pop culture, sports, technology, and the health sciences that show 
the relevance of algebra to daily life.
► Extensive and Varied Exercise Sets 
The text contains a wealth of exercises to provide 
students with opportunities to practice, apply, connect, review, and extend the skills they 
are learning. Numerous illustrations, tables, graphs, and photos help students visualize 
the problems they are solving. Problem types include skill-building and writing exercises, 
as well as applications, matching, true/false, multiple-choice, and fill-in-the-blank problems.
In the Annotated Instructor’s Edition of the text, the writing exercises are marked with an 
icon 0  so that instructors may assign these problems at their discretion. Students can 
watch an instructor work through the complete solution for all exercises marked with a 
Play Button icon Q  in MyMathLab.
► Special Summary Exercises 
We include a set of these popular in-chapter exercises in 
many chapters. They provide students with the all-important mixed review problems they 
need to master topics and often include summaries of solution methods and/or additional 
examples.
Step-by-Step Solutions to Selected Exercises 
Exercise numbers enclosed in a blue 
square, such as 11. , indicate that a worked-out solution for the problem is available in 
MyMathLab. These solutions are given for selected exercises that most commonly cause 
students difficulty.

OBJECTIVE ► 0  Write sets using set notation. A set is a collection of 
objects called the elements, or members, of the set. In algebra, the elements 
of a set are usually numbers. Set braces, { }, are used to enclose the elements.
For example, 2 is an element of the set {l, 2, 3}. Because we can count 
the number of elements in the set {1, 2, 3 }, it is a finite set.
In algebra, we refer to certain sets of numbers by name. The set
N  =  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 , . . .  }  
Natural (counting) numbers
is the natural numbers, or the counting numbers. The three dots (ellipsis 
points) show that the list continues in the same pattern indefinitely. We cannot 
list all of the elements of the set of natural numbers, so it is an infinite set. 
Including 0 with the set of natural numbers gives the set of whole numbers.
W =  {0 ,1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 , . . .  }  
Whole numbers
The set containing no elements is the empty set, or null set, usually written 
0 . For example, the set of whole numbers less than 0 is 0 .
O  CAUTION
Do not write { 0 }  for the empty set. { 0 }  is a set with one element, 0 . 
Use the notation 0  for the empty set.

A variable is a symbol, usually a letter, used to represent an unknown 
number or to define a set of numbers. For example,
{x | x is a natural number between 3 and 15}
(read “the set of all elements x such that x is a natural number between 3 and 
15”) defines the following set.
{4, 5, 6, 7 ,...,1 4 }
The notation {x \x is a natural number between 3 and 15} is an example 
of set-builder notation.
{x\x has property P}

all elements x 
such that x has a given property P
(b) Which elements of the set

Additive Inverse
For any real number a, the number- a  is the additive inverse of a.
We change the sign o f a number to find its additive inverse. As we shall see 
later, the sum o f a number and its additive inverse is always 0.
Uses of the Symbol -
The s y m b o l c a n  be used to indicate any of the following.
1. A negative number, as in -9 , read "negative 9"
2. The additive inverse of a number, as in "—4 is the additive inverse of 4"
3. Subtraction, as in 12 — 3, read "12 minus 3"
In the expression — ( — 5), the symbol 
” is being used in two ways: 
the first — indicates the additive inverse (or opposite) of —5, and the second 
indicates a negative number, — 5. Because the additive inverse of —5 is 5,
- ( - 5 )  = 5.
This example suggests the following property.

©  Use absolute value. Geometrically, the absolute value of
a number a, written | a |, is the distance on the number line from 0 to a. For 
example, the absolute value of 5 is the same as the absolute value of —5 
because each number lies five units from 0. See Figure 7.

Absolute Value

if a is positive or 0 
— a 
if a is negative.
Consider the second part of this definition, a
= — a if a is negative. If a is a
negative number, then —a, the additive inverse or opposite of a, is a positive 
number. Thus, a is positive. For example, let a = — 3.
a
—3 = — (—3) — 3 
| a | = — a if a is negative.

R.2 Operations on Real Numbers
OBJECTIVE o Add real numbers. Recall that the answer to an addition 
problem is a sum. The procedure for adding real numbers can be generalized 
in the following rules.
Adding Real Numbers
Same sign 
To add two numbers with the same sign, add their absolute 
values. The sum has the same sign as the given numbers.
Examples: 
2 + 7 = 9, 
—2 +  (—7) =  —9
Different signs 
To add two numbers with different signs, find the abso­
lute values of the numbers, and subtract the Lesser absolute value from 
the greater. The sum has the same sign as the number with the greater 
absolute value.
Examples: 
- 8  + 3 = — 5, 
15 + (—9) = 6
OBJECTIVES
o Add real numbers.
©  Subtract real numbers, 
o  Multiply real numbers.
O  Find the reriprocal of a number. 
0 Divide real numbers.
O  Find each sum. 
(a) - 2  + (-7 )
EXAMPLE 1
Adding Two Negative Real Numbers
Find each sum.
(a) - 1 2 +  (-8 )
First find the absolute values:
-1 2  = 12 
and 
- 8  = 8
Because —12 and —8 have the same sign, add their absolute values
- 1 2 +  ( - 8 )
Both numbers are 
negative, so the sum 
will be negative.
= —(12 + 8) 
Add the absolute values
=  -  (20)
=  - 2 0
(b) - 6  + (-3 )
= - ( 1 — 6| + 
= - ( 6  + 3) 
= - 9
(c) -1 .2 +  (-0.4)
= —(1.2 + 0.4) 
= —1.6

EXAMPLE 2
Adding Real Numbers with Different Signs
Find each sum.
(a) -1 7  + 11
First find the absolute values.
- 1 7 1 = 1 7  
and 
11 = 11 
Because —17 and 11 have different signs, subtract their absolute values.
17 -  11 = 6
The number —17 has a greater absolute value than 11, so the answer is 
negative.
-1 7  + 11 = - 6
The sum is 
negative because
1-171 > 1111.
(b) 4 + (-1 )
Subtract the absolute values, 4 and 1 
value, the sum must be positive.
Because 4 has the greater absolute
4 + (-1 ) = 4 —1 = 3
The sum is 
positive because
141 > l-ll.
(c) - 9  + 17
= 1 7 - 9

OBJECTIVE
©  Subtract real numbers. Recall that the answer to a subtrac 
tion problem is a difference. Consider the following statements.
6 - 4  = 2
6 + ( - 4 )  = 2
Thus,
6 - 4  = 6 +  (-4).
To subtract 4 from 6, we add the additive inverse of 4 to 6. This example 
suggests the following definition of subtraction of real numbers.

Section R.2 Operations on Real Numbers 15
Subtraction
For all real numbers a and br the following holds true.
a - b  = a + ( - b )
To subtract b from a, add the additive inverse (or opposite) of b to a. 
Examples:

Multiplying Real Numbers
Same sign 
The product of two numbers with the same sign is positive.

—4 (—8) = 32
Different signs 
The product of two numbers with different signs is negative. 
Examples: 
- 8  (9) = -72, 
6 (-7 ) = -42
The multiplication property of 0 states that the product of any real number 
and 0 is 0.
Multiplication Property of 0
For any real number a, the following hold true.
a • 0 =  0 
and 
0 • a =  0
Examples: 
12 • 0 = 0, 
0 • 12 = 0

This suggests the following definition of division of real numbers.
Division
For all real numbers a and b (where b #  0), the following holds true.
To divide a by b, multiply a (the dividend) by the reciprocal of b (the 
divisor).
There is no reciprocal for the number 0, so division by 0 is undefined. For 
example, y  is undefined and — ^ is undefined.
O  CAUTION
Although division by Ois undefined, dividing 0 by a nonzero number gives 
the quotient 0.

Example: 
— is undefined,

Q  Use exponents.
Q  Identify exponents and bases.
O  Find square roots.
O  Use the order of operations.
Q  Evaluate algebraic expressions for 
given values of variables.________ ^
Two (or more) numbers whose product is a third number are factors of that 
third number. For example, 2 and 6 are factors of 12 because 2 * 6 = 1 2 .
OBJECTIVE o Use exponents. In algebra, we use exponents as a way of 
writing products of repeated factors. For example, we write the product 
2 • 2 • 2 • 2 • 2 as follows.
2 • 2 • 2 • 2 • 2 = 2s

Note
In Example 1, we used the terms squared and cubed to refer to powers of 
2 and 3, respectively. The term squared comes from the figure of a square, 
which has the same measure for both length and width. See Figure 10(a). 
The term cubed comes from the figure of a cube, where the length, width, 
and height of a cube have the same measure. See Figure 10(b).

OBJECTIVE
O  Find square roots. As we saw in Example 2(a), 5 squared
(or 52) equals 25. The opposite (inverse) of squaring a number is taking its 
square root. For example, a square root of 25 is 5. Another square root of 
25 is —5 because (—5)2 = 25. Thus 25 has two square roots, 5 and —5.
We write the positive or principal square root of a number using a
radical symbol V~. The positive or principal square root of 25 is written 
V 25 = 5. The negative square root of 25 is written -  V 25 = — 5.
Because the square o f any nonzero real number is positive, the square 
root o f a negative number, such as V - 25, is not a real number.

R.4 Properties of Real Numbers
OBJECTIVES
Q  Use the distributive property.
Q  Use the identity properties.
O  Use the inverse properties.
O  Use the commutative and 
assoriative properties.
The basic properties of real numbers studied in this section, along with the 
multiplication property of zero presented earlier, reflect results that occur 
consistently in work with numbers. They have been generalized to apply to 
expressions with variables as well.
OBJECTIVE
Ll
►o Use the distributive property. Notice that
2(3 + 5) = 2 -8  = 16 
and 
2 • 3 + 2 • 5 = 6 + 10 = 16,
2(3 + 5) = 2 -3  + 2 -5.
Area of left part is 2 • 3 = 6.
Area of right part is 2 * 5 = 10.
Area of total rectangle is 2(3 + 5) = 16.
Figure 11
This idea is illustrated by the divided rectangle in Figure 11. Similarly, 
observe these facts.
—4 [5 + (—3)] = - 4 ( 2 )  = - 8  
- 4  (5) + (-4 ) (-3 ) = -2 0  + 12 = -  8,
- 4 [ 5  + ( - 3 ) ]  = - 4 ( 5 )  + ( - 4 )  ( - 3 ) .
These examples are generalized to all real numbers as the distributive 
property of multiplication with respect to addition, or simply the distrib­
utive property.
Distributive Property
For any real numbers a, b, and c, the following hold true.
a(b + c) = ab + ac 
and 
(b + c) a = ba + ca
Examples: 
12 (4 +  2) =  12 • 4 +  12 *2 
and
(4 +  2)12 =  4 - 1 2  +  2 - 1 2
The distributive property can also be applied "in reverse."
ab + ac = a (b + c) 
and 
ba + ca = (b + c) a
Examples: 
6 - 8  +  6 - 9 =  6(8 +  9) 
and 
8 - 6  +  9 - 6 =  (8 +  9)6
and
so
This property can be extended to more than two numbers as well.
a (b + c + d) = ab + ac + ad
The distributive property provides a way to rewrite a product a(b + c) 
as a sum ab + ac, or a sum as a product.
Note
When we use the distributive property to rewrite
a (b +  c) 
as 
ab +  ac, 
we refer to the process as "removing" or "clearing" parentheses.

Using the Distributive Property
Use the distributive property to rewrite each expression.
Use the first form of the property to 
rewrite the given product as a sum.

(b) — 2(5 + &)
= —2(5) + ( — 2) (k) 
Distributive property
= - 1 0 - 2 *
(c) 4x + 8jc
= (4 + 8)x 
= 12x
Multiply.
Use the distributive property in reverse 
to rewrite the given sum as a product.
Add inside the parentheses.

Because there is no common number or variable here, we cannot use the 
distributive property to rewrite the expression.
(f) 6 (x + 2 y - 3 z )
= 6x + 6 (2y) + 6 (— 3z) 
Distributive property
= 6x + 12y — 18z
Multiply.

= 38 (17 + 3) 
Distributive property
= 38(20) 
= 760
Add inside the parentheses.
Multiply.
Work Problem ©  at the Side. ►
The distributive property can also be used for subtraction.
a{b — c) = ab — ac 
Example: 6 (x — y) = 6x — 6y
o Use the distributive property to 
rewrite each expression.
(a) 8 (m + n)
(b) —4 (p — 5)
(c) 3k + 6k
(d) —6m + 2m
(e) 2r + 35

© U s e  the distributive property to 
evaluate each expression.
(a) 78 • 33 + 22 • 33
(b) 1 4 - 5 + 1 4 - 8 5
OBJECTIVE e Use the identity properties. The number 0 is the only 
number that can be added to any number to obtain that number, leaving the 
identity of the number unchanged. For this reason, 0 is the identity element 
for addition, or the additive identity.
Multiplying any number by 1 leaves the identity of the number 
unchanged. Thus, 1 is the identity element for multiplication, or the 
multiplicative identity. The identity properties summarize this discussion.

Identity Properties
For any real number a, the following hold true.
a +  0 = a 
and
0 +  o =  o
Examples: 
9 +  0 =: 9 
and
0 +  9 = 9
0 * 1  = a 
and
1 - 0  =  0
Examples: 
9 * 1  = 9 
and
1 - 9  =  9
The identity properties leave the identity o f a real number unchanged.
Think of a child wearing a costume on Halloween. The child’s appearance is 
changed, but his or her identity is unchanged.

your shoes when you get up in the morning and then taking them off before 
you go to bed at night are inverse operations that undo each other.

Expressions such as 12m and 5n from Example 3 are examples of terms. 
A term  is a number or the product of a number and one or more variables 
raised to powers. The numerical factor in a term is the numerical coeffi­
cient, or just the coefficient. Some examples are shown in the table.

(d) 5 • -------= 1
OBJECTIVE !o Use the commutative and associative properties. Simpli­
fying expressions as in Examples 3(a) and (b) is called combining like 
terms. Only like terms may be combined. To combine like terms in an 
expression such as
—2m + 5m + 3 — 6m + 8,
we need two more properties. From arithmetic, we know that the following 
are true.
3 + 9 = 12 
and 
9 + 3 = 12
3 • 9 = 27 
and 
9 • 3 = 27
The order o f the numbers being added or multiplied does not matter. The
same answers result. The following computations illustrate this fact.
(5 + 7) + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14 
5 + (7 + 2) = 5 + 9 = 14
(5 • 7) • 2 = 35 • 2 = 70 
5 • (7 • 2) = 5 • 14 = 70
The grouping o f the numbers being added or multiplied does not matter.
The same answers result.

Commutative and Associative Properties
For any real numbers a, b, and c, the following hold true.
a +  b =  b +  a I
> Commutative properties
ab =  ba 
J
(The order of the two terms or factors changes.)
Examptes: 
9 +  (—3) =  — 3 +  9 
and 
9 (—3) =  (—3) 9
a +  (b +  c) =  (a +  b) +  c \
> Associative properties
a (be) =  (ab) c 
j
(The grouping among the three terms or factors changes, but the order 
stays the same.)
Examples: 7 +  (8 +  9) =  (7 +  8) +  9 
and 
7 • (8 • 9) =  (7 • 8) • 9
The commutative properties are used to change the order of the terms or 
factors in an expression. Think of commuting from home to work and then 
from work to home. The associative properties are used to regroup the terms 
or factors of an expression. The grouped terms or factors are associated.

= (—2m + 5m) + 3 — 6m + 8 
Associative property 
= (—2 + 5)m  + 3 — 6m + 8 
Distributive property
= 3m + 3 — 6m + 8
Add inside parentheses.
The next step would be to add 3m and 3, but they are unlike terms. To 
combine 3m and —6m, use the associative and commutative properties, 
inserting parentheses and brackets as needed according to the rules for order 
of operations.
= [3m + (3 — 6m) ] + 8 
=  [3m + ( —6m + 3) ] + 8  
= [(3m + [ — 6m]) + 3 ] + 8 
= ( — 3m + 3) + 8 
=  —3m +  (3 +  8)
= —3m +11

In practice, many of the steps are not written down, but it is important to 
realize that the commutative and associative properties are used whenever the 
terms in an expression are rearranged and regrouped to combine like terms.

Approaches to Reading Your Math Text
Student A Learns best by listening to his teacher explain things. He "gets it" when he 
sees the instructor work problems. He previews the section before the lecture, so he 
knows generally what to expect. Student A carefully reads the section in his text 
AFTER he hears the classroom lecture on the topic.
Student B learns best by reading on her own. She reads the section and works through 
the examples before coming to class. That way, she knows what the teacher is going 
to talk about and what questions she wants to ask. Student B carefully reads the 
section in her text BEFORE she hears the classroom lecture on the topic.
Which reading approach works better for you—that of Student A 
or that of Student B?______
Tips fo r Reading Your M ath Text
► Turn off your cell phone and the TV. You will be able to concentrate more fully on 
what you are reading.
► Survey the material. Glance over the assigned materialto get an idea of the "big 
picture." Look at the list of objectives to see what you will be learning.
► Read slowly. Read only one section—or even part of a section—at a sitting, with 
paper and pencil in hand.
► Pay special attention to important information given in colored boxes or set in 
boldface type. Highlight any additional information you find helpful.
► Study the examples carefully. Pay particular attention to the blue side comments 
and any pointer balloons.
► Do the margin problems in the workspace provided or on separate paper as
you go. These problems mirror the examples and prepare you for the exercise set. 
Check your answers with those given at the bottom of the page.
► Make study cards as you read. Make cards for new vocabulary, rules, procedures, 
formulas, and sample problems.
► Mark anything you don't understand. ASK  QUESTIONS in class—everyone will 
benefit. Follow up with your instructor, as needed.

Algebraic expressions
Equations and inequalities compare algebraic expressions, just as a balance 
scale compares the weights of two quantities. Recall that an equation is a 
statement that two algebraic expressions are equal. An equation always con­
tains an equality symbol, while an expression does not.
EXAMPLE 1
Distinguishing between Expressions and Equations
Decide whether each of the following is an expression or an equation.
(a) 3x — 1 = 2 
(b) 3 x - l
In part (a) we have an equation, because there is an equality symbol. In 
part (b), there is no equality symbol, so it is an expression.

Linear Equation in One Variable
A linear equation in one variable (here*) can be written in the form
Ax + B = C, 
where A, B, and Care real numbers and A #  0.
Examples: 
x +  1 =  —2, x — 3 =  5, 
2x +  5 =  10 
Linear equations
Answers
1. (a) equation (b) expression 
(c) expression 
(d) equation
A linear equation is a first-degree equation because the greatest power 
on the variable is 1. The following are not linear (that is, nonlinear).
x 2 + 3 y = 5,
g
— = —22, 
and V r = 6 
x
Nonlinear equations
If the variable in an equation can be replaced by a real number that 
makes the statement true, then that number is a solution of the equation. For 
example, 8 is a solution of x — 3 = 5 because replacing x with 8 gives a true 
statement, 8 — 3 = 5. An equation is solved by finding its solution set, the 
set of all solutions. The solution set of x — 3 = 5 is {8}.
Equivalent equations are related equations that have the same solution 
set. To solve an equation, we usually start with the given equation and replace 
it with a series of simpler equivalent equations. The following are all equiva­
lent because each has solution set { 3 }.
5.x+ 2 =  17, 
5x = 15, 
and x = 3 
Equivalent equations

Section 1.1 
Linear Equations in One Variable 49
OBJECTIVE ! O  Solve linear equations using the addition and multiplica­
tion properties of equality. We use two important properties of equality to 
produce equivalent equations.
Addition and Multiplication Properties of Equality
Addition Property of Equality
If A, B, and C represent real numbers, then the equations
A =  B 
and A + C = B + C 
are equivalent.
In words, the same number may be added to each side of an equa­
tion without changing the solution se t
Multiplication Property of Equality
If A, B, and C represent real numbers and C #  0, then the equations
A = B 
and AC = BC 
are equivalent.
In words, each side of an equation may be multiplied by the same 
nonzero number without changing the solution set.
Because subtraction and division are defined in terms of addition and 
multiplication, respectively, these properties can be extended.
The same number may be subtracted from each side o f an equa­
tion, and each side o f an equation may be divided by the same 
nonzero number; without changing the solution set.
EXAMPLE 2
Solving a Linear Equation
Solve 4x — 2x — 5 = 4 + 6x + 3.
The goal is to isolate x on one side of the equation.
4x — 2x — 5 = 4 + 6x + 3 
2x — 5 = 7 + 6x
Combine like terms.
2x — 5 — 6x = 7 + 6x — 6x 
Subtract 6x from each side.
—4x - 5 = 1

Solving a Linear Equation in One Variable
Step 1 
Simplify each side separately. Use the distributive property as
needed.
• Clear any parentheses.
• Clear any fractions or decimals.
• Combine like terms.
Step 2 Isolate the variable terms on one side. Use the addition prop­
erty of equality so that all terms with variables are on one side of 
the equation and all constants (numbers) are on the other side.
Step 3 
Isolate the variable. Use the multiplication property of equality
to obtain an equation that has just the variable with coefficient 1 
on one side.
Step 4 
Check. Substitute the value found into the original equation. If a
true statement results, write the solution set. If not, rework the 
problem.

Solving a Linear Equation
Solve 2{k — 5) + 3k = k +  6.
Step 1 Clear parentheses on the left. Then combine like terms
Be sure to distribute 
over all terms within 
parentheses.
2(k — 5) + 3 k = k + 6
2k + 2 (—5) + 3k = k + 6

5k -  10 = k + 6
Distributive property 
Multiply.
Combine like terms.
Step 2 Isolate the variable terms on one side and constants on the other.
5k — 1 0 — k = k + 6 — k 
Subtract k.
4k -  10 = 6 
4k — 10 + 10 = 6 + 10

Solving a Linear Equation with Decimals
Solve 0.06* + 0.09 (15 -  *) = 0.07 (15).
0.06* + 0.09 (15 - * )  = 0.07 (15)
Clear parentheses first.

Distributive property
0.06* + 1.35 — 0.09* = 1.05
Multiply.
Now clear the decimals by multiplying by a power of 10. Because each 
decimal number here is given in hundredths, we multiply each term by 100 
(that is, by 102). A number can be multiplied by 100 by moving the decimal 
point two places to the right.

O  CAUTION
Notice in the examples that the equality symbols are aligned in columns. 
Do not use more than one equality symbol in a horizontal line of work 
when solving an equation.
OBJECTIVE !o Identify conditional equations, identities, and contradic
tions. The preceding equations had solution sets containing one element. 
Some equations, however, have an infinite number of solutions, while others 
have no solution. The table below summarizes these types of equations.
SOLUTION SETS OF EQUATIONS
Type of Linear

Conditional
One solution; 
solution set (a number)
Indication When Solving
Final line is x = a number. 
(See Examples 2-6, 7(a).)
Identity
Infinitely many solutions; 
solution set 
(all real numbers)
Final line is true, such as
0 =  0.
(See Example 7(b).)
Contradiction
No solution; 
solution set 0
Final line is false, such as 
-15 = -20.
(See Example 7(c).)
Note
Recall that we use the symbol 0  to represent the empty set (or null set), 
which is the set containing no elements. If an equation has no solution, 
then there are no elements in its solution set. In this case, we write the 
solution set as 0 .

or a contradiction.

5 (2 * + 6) — 2 = 7(* + 4)
10* + 30 — 2 = lx  + 28
Distributive property
10* + 28 = lx  + 28
Combine like terms.
10* + 28 — 7x -  28 = lx  + 28 -  lx  -  28
Subtract lx. Subtract 28.
3* = 0
Combine like terms.

* = 0
CHECK 
5(2.e + 6) — 2 = 7 (jt + 4)
Original equation
5 [2 (0) + 6 ] — 2 = 7 (0 + 4)
Let x = 0.
5 (6) — 2 = 1 (4)
Multiply, and then add.
28 = 28 /
True
The value 0 checks, so the solution set is {0}. Because the solution set has
only one element, 5 (2 * +  6) — 2 = 7 (x + 4) is a conditional equation.
5jc — 15 = 5 (jc — 3)
5x — 15 = 5x — 15 
5* — 15 -  5x + 15 = 5* — 15 -  5x + 15
The variable has 
n    n
"disappeared." 
U — U
Distributive property 
Subtract 5x. Add 15. 
True
The true statement 0 = 0 indicates that the solution set is {all real numbers}. 
The equation 5x — 15 = 5 (jc — 3) is an identity. Notice that the first step 
yielded
5x — 15 = 5x — 15, 
which is true for all values of x.
We could have identified the equation as an identity at that point.
5* — 15 = 5 (x — 4)
5x — 15 = 5.x — 20 
Distributive property
5x — 15 — 5x = 5x — 20 — 5x 
Subtract 5x.
The variable has 
"disappeared=s 
-1 5  = -2 0
False
Because the result, —15 = —20, is false, the equation has no solution. The 
solution set is 0 , so the equation 5x — 15 = 5 {x — 4) is a contradiction.

A common error in solving an equation like that in Example 7(a) is to 
think that the equation has no solution and write the solution set as 0 . 
This equation has one solution, the number 0, so itis  a conditional equa­
tion with solution set {o }.

COMPLETING YOUR HOMEWORK
Y
ou are ready to do your homework AFTER you have read the corresponding 
text section and worked through the examples and margin problems.
Hom ework Tips
► Survey the exercise set. Take a few minutes to glance over the prob­
lems that your instructor has assigned to get a general idea of the 
types of exercises you will be working. Skim directions, and note any 
references to section examples.
► Work problems neatly. Use pencil and write Legibly, so others
can read your work. Skip lines between steps. Clearly separate prob­
lems from each other.
► Show all your work. It is tempting to take shortcuts. Include ALL 
steps.
► Check your work frequently to make sure you are on the right 
track. It is hard to unlearn a mistake. For all odd-numbered problems 
and other selected exercises, answers are given in the back of the text.
► If you have trouble with a problem, refer to the corresponding worked example in the 
section. The exercise directions will often reference specific examples to review. Pay attention 
to every line of the worked example to see how to get from step to step.
► If you are having trouble with an even-numbered problem, work the corresponding 
odd-numbered problem. Check your answer in the back of the text, and apply the same steps 
to work the even-numbered problem.
► Do some homework problems every day. This is a good habit, even if your math class does 
not meet each day.
► Mark any problems you don't understand. Ask your instructor about them.

A mathematical model is an equation or inequality that describes a real 
situation. Models for many applied problems, called formulas, already exist. 
A formula is an equation in which variables are used to describe a relation­
ship. For example, the formula for finding the area si* of a triangle is
si = ~bh.

Here, b is the length of the base and h is the 
height. See Figure 1. A list of formulas is 
given at the back of this text.

OBJECTIVE
i
►o Solve a formula for a specified variable. The formula
I = prt says that interest on a loan or investment equals principal (amount 
borrowed or invested) times rate (percent) times time at interest (in years). To 
determine how long it will take for an investment at a stated interest rate to 
earn a predetermined amount of interest, it would help to first solve the for­
mula for t. This process is called solving for a specified variable, or solving 
a literal equation.
When solving for a specified variable, the key is to treat that variable as 
if it were the only one. Treat all other variables like constants (numbers).
(a) p
(b) r
EXAMPLE 1
Solving for a Specified Variable
Solve the formula I = prt for t.
We solve this formula for t by treating I, p, and r as constants (having 
fixed values) and treating t as the only variable.

Finding Unknown Numerical Quantities
For the 2015 regular season, the 
Major League Baseball leaders for 
stolen bases were Dee Gordon of the 
Miami Marlins and Billy Hamilton 
of the Cincinnati Reds. These two 
players had a total of 115 stolen bases. 
Gordon had 1 more stolen base than 
Hamilton. How many stolen bases did 
each of these players have? (Data from

Step 1 Read the problem. We are asked to find the number of stolen bases
each player had.
Step 2 Assign a variable to represent the number of stolen bases for one of
the men.
Let s = the number of stolen bases for Billy Hamilton.
We must also find the number of stolen bases for Dee Gordon. 
Because he had 1 more stolen base than Hamilton,
s + 1 = the number of stolen bases for Gordon.

Solving a Percent Problem
In 2014, total annual health expenditures in the United States were about 
$3000 billion (or $3.0 trillion). This was an increase of 320% over the total 
for 1990. What were the approximate total health expenditures in billions of 
dollars in 1990? (Data from www.cdc.gov)
Step 1 Read the problem. We are given that the total health expenditures
increased by 320% from 1990 to 2014, and $3000 billion was spent 
in 2014. We must find the expenditures in 1990.
Step 2 Assign a variable. Let x = total health expenditures for 1990.
320% = 320(0.01) = 3.2
Thus, 3.2x represents the increase in expenditures from 1990 to 2014.

O  CAUTION
Avoid two common errors that occur when solving problems Like the one 
in Examples.
1. Do not try to find 320% of 3000 and subtract that amount from 3000. 
The 320% should be applied to the amount in 1990, not the amount
in 2014.
2. In Step 3, do not write the equation as
x + 3.2 = 3000. 
Incorrect
The percent must be multiplied by some number—in this case, the 
amount spent in 1990—giving 3.2x.

O  Solve investment problems. The investment problems 
in this chapter deal with simple interest. In most real-world applications, 
compound interest (covered in a later chapter) is used.
EXAMPLE 6
Solving an Investment Problem
Thomas invested $40,000. He put part of the money in an account paying 2% 
interest and the remainder into stocks paying 3% interest. The total annual in­
come from these investments was $1020. How much did he invest at each rate?
Step 1 Read the problem again. We must find the two amounts.
Step 2 Assign a variable.
Let 
x = the amount invested at 2%, and
40,000 — x = the amount invest at 3%.
The formula for interest is / = prt. Here the time t is 1 yr. Use a table

Multiply by 100.
Move decimal points 
2 places to the right.
2* + 120,000 -  3* = 102,000

Multiply.
Combine like terms.
Subtract 120,000. 
Multiply by — 1.
Step 5 State the answer. Thomas invested $18,000 of the money at 2%. At
3%, he invested $40,000 -  $18,000 = $22,000.
Step 6 Check. Find the annual interest at each rate. The sum of these two
amounts should total $1020.
0.02 ($18,000) = $360 
and 
0.03 ($22,000) = $660
$360 + $660 = $1020,

OBJECTIVE
O  Solve mixture problems. Mixture problems involving rates 
of concentration can be solved with linear equations.
EXAMPLE 7
Solving a Mixture Problem
A chemist must mix 8 L of a 40% acid solution with some 70% solution to 
make a 50% solution. How much of the 70% solution should be used?
Step 1 Read the problem. We must find the amount of 70% solution.
Step 2 Assign a variable.
Let x = the number of liters of 70% solution.
The information in the problem is illustrated in Figure 5. We use it to 
complete a table.

Step 4 Solve.

Distributive property
Multiply by 10 
to clear the decimals.
Move decimal points 
1 place to the right.
32 + lx  = 40 + 5x
2x = 8
x = 4
Subtract 32 and 5x. 
Divide by 2.
Step 5 State the answer. The chemist should use 4 L of the 70% solution.
Step 6 Check. 8 L of 40% solution plus 4 L of 70% solution is
8 (0.40) + 4 (0.70) = 6 L of acid.
Similarly, 8 + 4 or 12 L of 50% solution has
12 (0.50) = 6 L of acid.
The total amount of pure acid is 6 L both before and after mixing, 
so the answer checks.

EXAMPLE 8
Solving a Mixture Problem When One Ingredient Is Pure
The octane rating of gasoline is a measure of its antiknock qualities. For a 
standard fuel, the octane rating is the percent of isooctane. How many liters 
of pure isooctane should be mixed with 200 L of 94% isooctane, referred to 
as 94 octane, to obtain a mixture that is 98% isooctane?
Step 1 Read the problem. We must find the amount of pure isooctane.
Step 2 Assign a variable.
Let x = the number of liters of pure (100%) isooctane. 
Complete a table. Recall that 100% = 100(0.01) = 1.

Step 5 State the answer. 400 L of isooctane are needed.
Step 6 Check by substituting 400 for x in the equation from Step 3.
x + 0.94 (200) = 0.98 (x + 200)
400 + 0.94 (200) = 0.98 (400 + 200) 
Let x = 400.
400 + 188 = 0.98 (600) 
Multiply. Add.

Problem-Solving Hint
Uniform motion problems use the distance formula d =  rt. When rate 
(or speed) is given in miles per hour, time must be given in hours. Draw 
a sketch to illustrate what is happening. Make a table to summarize 
given information.
EXAMPLE 2

Two cars leave the same place at the same time, one going east and the other 
west. The eastbound car averages 40 mph, while the westbound car averages 
50 mph. In how many hours will they be 300 mi apart?
Step 1 Read the problem. We must find the time it takes for the two cars to
be 300 mi apart.
Step 2 Assign a variable. A sketch shows what is happening in the prob­
lem. The cars are going in opposite directions. See Figure 6.

o Find the value of x, and 
determine the measure of 
each angle.
Answer
4. 28°, 63°, 89°
Problem-Solving Hint
In Example 3 it was easier to Let the variable represent a quantity other 
than the one that we were asked to find. This is the case in some prob­
lems. It takes practice to Learn when this approach works best.
OBJECTIVE ! Q  Solve problems about angles. An important result of
Euclidean geometry (the geometry of the Greek mathematician Euclid) is 
as follows.
The sum o f the angle measures o f any triangle is 180°.
EXAMPLE 4
Finding Angle Measures
Find the value of x, and determine the measure of each angle in Figure 8.
Step 1 Read the problem. We are asked to find the measure of each angle.
Step 2 Assign a variable.
Let x = the measure of one angle.
Step 3 W rite an equation. The sum of the three measures shown in the
figure must be 180°.
x + (x + 20) + (210 — 3x) = 180 
Measures are in degrees.
Step 4 Solve.
—x + 230 = 180 
Combine like terms, 
—x = ~50 
Subtract 230.
x = 50
Multiply by — 1.
Step 5 State the answer. One angle measures 50°. The other two angles
measure
and
x + 20 = 50 + 20 = 70°
210 -  3x = 210 -  3 (50) = 60°.
Step 6 Check. Because 50° + 70° + 60° = 180°, the answer is correct.
◄ Work Problem 0  at the Side,
0  Solve problems about consecutive integers. Recall that the
set of integers is
{ . . . ,  -3 , - 2 ,- 1 , 0, 1, 2, 3,...}.
Consecutive integers are integers that are next to each other on a number 
line. Two consecutive integers differ by 1. Some examples of consecutive 
integers are 4, 5 and - 6 ,- 5 .
Consecutive even integers always differ by 2. Examples are 4, 6 and 
—4, —2. Similarly, consecutive odd integers also differ by 2, such as 1, 3 
and —5, —3.

EXAMPLE 5
Solving a Consecutive Integer Problem
Find three consecutive integers such that the sum of the first and third, 
increased by 3, is 50 more than the second.
Step 1 Read the problem. We are told to find three consecutive integers
satisfying the given conditions.
Step 2 Assign a variable.
Let 
x = the least of the three consecutive integers.
Then x + 1 = the second (middle) integer,
and x + 2 = the greatest of the three consecutive integers.
Step 3 W rite an equation.

2x + 5 =  x + 51 
x = 46
Combine like terms. 
Subtract x and 5.
Step 5 State the answer. The solution is 46, so the first integer is x = 46,
the second is 46 + 1 =47, and the third is 46 + 2 = 48. The three 
integers are
46, 
47, 
and 
48. 
Step 6 Check. The sum of the first and third is
46 + 48 = 94.
If this is increased by 3, the result is
94 + 3 = 97,
which is indeed 50 more than the second (47). The answer is correct.

2.1 Linear Inequalities in One Variable
OBJECTIVES
▼
Q  Graph intervals on a number line.
O  Solve linear inequalities using the 
addition property.
O  Solve linear inequalities using the 
multiplication property.
O  Solve linear inequalities with three 
parts.
Q  Solve applied problems using linear 
inequalities.
An inequality consists of algebraic expressions related by one of the fol­
lowing symbols. (The symbols are read as shown when the inequality is read 
from left to right.)
<  “is less than” 
^  “is less than or equal to”
>  “is greater than” 
^  “is greater than or equal to”
We solve an inequality by finding all real number solutions for it. For 
example, the solution set of x <  2 includes all real numbers that are less 
than or equal to 2, not just the integers less than or equal to 2.
OBJECTIVE
O  Graph intervals on a number line. A good way to show the
solution set of an inequality is by graphing. We graph all the real numbers 
satisfying x ^  2 by placing a square bracket at 2 and drawing an arrow to 
the left to represent the fact that all numbers less than 2 are also part of the 
graph. See Figure 1.
2 is included.

Figure 1 The interval (—o°, 2 ]
The set of numbers less than or equal to 2 is an example of an interval 
on a number line. To write intervals, we use interval notation, which often 
includes the infinity symbols, oo and — oo. We write the interval of all num­
bers less than or equal to 2 as ( — oo, 2]. The negative infinity symbol — 
does not indicate a number. Rather, it shows that the interval includes all real 
numbers less than 2. The square bracket indicates that 2 is included in the 
solution set.
Remember the following important concepts regarding interval notation.
• A parenthesis indicates that an endpoint is not included.
• A square bracket indicates that an endpoint is included.
• A parenthesis is always used next to an infinity symbol, — co or oo.
• The set of real numbers is written in interval notation as ( — °°, 00).
EXAMPLE 1
Using Interval Notation
Write each inequality in interval notation, and graph the interval.
(a) x >  
5
This statement says that x can represent any number greater than —5, but 
x cannot equal —5. This interval is written (—5, 
). We graph it by placing
a parenthesis at —5 and drawing an arrow to the right, as in Figure 2. The 
parenthesis at —5 shows that —5 is not part of the graph.
-5  is not included.

(b) -1  <  * <  3
This statement is read 
1 is less than or equal to x and x is less than
3.” We want the set of numbers that are between — 1 and 3, with —1 included 
and 3 excluded. In interval notation, we write [—1,3), using a bracket at — 1 
because it is part of the graph and a parenthesis at 3 because it is not part of 
the graph. See Figure 3.

Solving inequalities is similar to solving equations.
Linear Inequality in One Variable
A linear inequality in one variable (here*) can be written in the form 
Ax + B <  C, Ax + B ^  C, 
Ax + B >  C, 
or Ax + B ^  C,
where A, B, and Care real numbers and A #  0.
Examples: 
x +  5 <  2, x — 3 >  5,

OBJECTIVE
Q  Solve linear inequalities using the addition property. We
solve an inequality by finding all numbers that make the inequality true. 
Usually, an inequality has an infinite number of solutions. These solutions, 
like solutions of equations, are found by producing a series of simpler equiv­
alent inequalities. Equivalent inequalities are inequalities with the same 
solution set.
We use two important properties to produce equivalent inequalities.
Addition Property of Inequality
If A, B, and C represent real numbers, then the inequalities
A < B  
and A + C < B  + C 
are equivalent.*
In words, the same number may be added to each side of an inequality 
without changing the solution set.
*This also applies to A <  B, A > B, and A > B.

EXAMPLE 2
Using the Addition Property of Inequality
Solve x — 1 <  —12, and graph the solution set.
x - 1  < -12
X - 7  + 7 C - 1 2  + 7 
Add 7.
x <  — 5 
Combine like terms.
CHECK Substitute —5 for x in the equation x — 1 = —12.
x - 1  = -1 2
— 5 —7 = —12 
Letx = — 5.
— 12 = —12 /  True
The result, a true statement, shows that —5 is the boundary point. Now we 
test a value on each side of —5 to verify that values less than —5 make the 
inequality true. We choose —6 and —4.
x - 1  < -1 2
— 6 — 7 <C —12 
Let x = —6.
— 13 <  —12 y  True 
—6 is in the solution set.
— 4 — 7 <  —12 
Let x = —4.
— 11 <  —12 
False 
—4 is not in the solution set.
The check confirms that x <  5, written as the interval ( — oo, —5), is the 
solution set. See Figure 4.

Solve 14 + 2m ^  3m, and graph the solution set.

Combine like terms. 
Rewrite so the variable

The inequality 14 <  m (that is, 14 is less than or equal to m) can also be 
written m >  14 (that is, m is greater than or equal to 14). Notice that in 
each case, the inequality symbol points to the lesser number, 14.
CHECK
14 + 2m = 3m

Multiplying each side of an inequality by a negative number requires 
reversing the direction of the inequality symbol. The same is true for divid­
ing by a negative number since division is defined in terms of multiplication.
Multiplication Property of Inequality
Let A , B, and C represent real numbers, where C #  0.
(a) If Cis positive, then the inequalities
A < B 
and 
AC < BC 
are equivalent.*
(b) If Cis negative, then the inequalities
A < B 
and 
AC > BC 
are equivalent.*
In words, each side of an inequality may be multiplied (or divided) by 
the same positive number without changing the direction of the inequal­
ity symbol. If the multiplier is negative, we must reverse the direction 
of the inequality symbol.
* This also applies to A < B, A > B, and A >  B.

Using the Multiplication Property of Inequality
Solve each inequality, and graph the solution set.

Linear Inequalities in One Variable 115
Solving a Linear Inequality in One Variable
Step 1 
Simplify each side separately. Use the distributive property as
needed.
• Clear any parentheses.
• Clear any fractions or decimals.
• Combine like terms.
Step 2 Isolate the variable terms on one side. Use the addition property
of inequality so that all terms with variables are on one side of the 
inequality and all constants (numbers) are on the other side.
Step 3 Isolate the variable. Use the multiplication property of inequal­
ity to obtain an inequality in one of the following forms, where A- 
is a constant (number).
variable <  k, 
variable <  k, 
variable >  k, 
or 
variable >  k
Remember: 
Reverse the direction of the inequality symbol only when 
multiplying or dividing each side of an inequality by a negative number.
EXAMPLE 5
Solving a Linear Inequality
Solve — 3 (x + 4) + 2 ^  7 — x, and graph the solution set.
Clear parentheses using the 
distributive property:
—3 (x + 4) = —3x — 3 (4).
Step 1 
— 3(x + 4 ) + 2 ^ 7  — x
Step 2
— 3x — 12 + 2 >  7 — x
—3x — 10 >  7 — x
- l x  -  10 >  7
Combine like terms.
—3x — 10 + x >  7 — x + x 
Add x.
Combine like terms
-2 x  -  10 + 10 >  7 + 10
Add 10.

73. Suppose Lauren earns all of the homework and vocabulary 
points, 50 points for daily activities, and 90 points for lab 
participation and completion.
Let x = points to be earned on exams.
(a) Write three inequalities to find the minimum number 
of points she needs on exams to earn grades no lower 
than A, B, and C.
(b) Solve each inequality from part (a) to find the minimum

of points, given that exams account for 450 possible 
points? (Round up to the nearest whole number.)
74. See Exercise 73. Write and solve a compound 
inequality to find the range of points Lauren needs 
in exam scores to earn a B average. What range of 
“test averages” (as percents) correspond to these 
scores, given that exams account for 450 possible 
points? (Round up to the nearest whole number.)

Absolute Value Equations and Inequalities 135
2.3 Absolute Value Equations and Inequalities
Suppose a government will impose a restriction on greenhouse gas emis­
sions within 3 years of 2025. This means that the difference between the year 
it will comply and 2025 is less than 3, without regard to sign. We state this 
mathematically as follows, where x represents the year in which it complies.
x — 2025 <  3 
Absolute value inequality
We can intuitively reason that the year must be between 2022 and 2028, and 
thus 2022 <  x <  2028 makes this inequality true.
o Use the distance definition of absolute value. Recall that 
the absolute value of a number x, written \x \, represents the undirected 
distance from x to 0 on a number line. For example, the solution set of 
= 4 is {-4, 4}, which means x = —■4 or x = 4, as shown in Figure 24.

Solving Absolute Value Equations and Inequalities
Let k be a positive real number, and p and q be real numbers.

ax + b = k or ax + b = —k.
The solution set is usually of the form {p, q } , which includes two 
numbers.

Case 2 
To solve \ ax +  b\ > k*, solve the compound inequality

The solution set is of the form (—°°,p) U (p, co), which consists 
of disjoint intervals.

Note
It is also acceptable to write the compound statements in Cases 1 and 2 of 
the box as the following equivalent forms.
ax + b =  k 
or 
—(ax + b)  =  k 
Alternative for Case 1
ax +  b >  k 
or 
— (a x +  b ) >  k 
Alternative for Case 2
These forms produce the same results.
OBJECTIVE ! ©  Solve equations of the form \ax +  b\ =  k, for k > 0.
Remember that because absolute value refers to distance from the origin, 
an absolute value equation (with k > 0) will have two parts.

The expression 2x + 1 must represent a number that is less than 7 units 
from 0 on either side of a number line. Another way of thinking of this is to 
realize that 2x + 1 must be between —7 and 7, which is written as a three-

Refer to Examples 1, 2, and 3, and remember the following.
1. The methods described apply when the constant is alone on one side 
of the equation or inequality and is positive.
2. Absolute value equations | ax + b \ = k and absolute value inequalities

OBJECTIVE
O  Solve special cases of absolute value equations and
inequalities. When an absolute value equation or inequality involves a 
negative constant or 0 alone on one side, we use the following properties to 
solve it.
Special Properties of Absolute Value
Property 1 
The absolute value of an expression can never be negative
that is. a
> 0 for all real numbers a.
Property 2 
The absolute value of an expression equals 0 only when the
expression is equal to 0.
EXAMPLE 8
Solving Special Cases of Absolute Value Equations
Solve each equation, 
(a) 5r — 3 = - 4
See Property 1.
The absolute value o f an expression can never be negative, so there are 
no solutions for this equation. The solution set is 0 .
(b) l x - 3  = 0
See Property 2.
The expression lx  — 3 will equal 0 only if lx  — 3 equals 0.
lx  — 3 = 0 
| a | = 0 implies a = 0.
__________  
lx  = 3 
Add 3.
Check by

EXAMPLE 9
Solving Special Cases of Absolute Value Inequalities
Solve each inequality.
(a)
x
>  - 4
See Property 1.
The absolute value of a number is always greater than or equal to 0.
Thus,
(b)
x
>  —4 is true for all real numbers. The solution set is 
00).
x + 6 — 3 <  —5
x + 6 <  — 2 
Add 3 to each side,
By Property 1, there is no number whose absolute value is less than —2, so 
this inequality has no solution. The solution set is 0 .
(c)
x — 1 + 4  <  4
x — 7 <  0 
Subtract 4 from each side,
The value of x — 7 will never be less than 0 (Property 1). However, \ x — 1 
will equal 0 when x = 7 (Property 2). Therefore, the solution set is {7}.

o  Solve an application involv­
ing relative error. Absolute value is used to 
find relative error, or tolerance, in a measure­
ment. If x represents actual measurement and 
xt represents expected measurement, then the 
absolute value of the difference of x and xt, 
divided by xt, gives the relative error in x.
relative error in x
In quality control situations, relative error must 
often be less than some predetermined amount.
EXAMPLE 10
Solving an Application Involving Relative Error
A machine filling quart milk cartons is set for a relative error that is no 
greater than 0.05. How many ounces may a filled carton contain?
Here xt = 32 oz (because 1 qt = 32 oz), and relative error = 0.05. We 
must find x, the actual measurement of a filled carton.
Substitute the given values.

TAKING MATH TESTS
Techniques to Improve 
YourTest Score
Comments
Come prepared with a pencil, eraser, paper, 
and calculator, if allowed.
Working in penal lets you erase, keeping your 
work neat.
Scan the entire test, note the point values 
of different problems, and plan your time 
accordingly.
To do 20 problems in 50 minutes, allow 
50 -h 20 = 2.5 minutes per problem. Spend 
less time on the easier problems.
Do a "knowledge dump " when you get the 
test. Write important notes, such as formulas, 
in a corner of the test.
Writing down tips and information that you've 
learned at the beginning allows you to relax 
later.
Read directions carefully and circle any 
significant words. When you finish a problem, 
reread the directions. Did you do what was 
asked?
Pay attention to any announcements written 
on the board or made by your instructor. Ask if 
you don't understand something.
Show all your work. Many teachers give partial 
credit if some steps are correct, even if the final 
answer is wrong. Write neatly.
If your teacher can't read your writing, you 
won't get credit for it. If you need more space 
to work, ask to use extra paper.
Write down anything that might help solve a 
problem: a formula, a diagram, etc. If neces­
sary, circle the problem and come back to it 
later. Do not erase anything you wrote down.
If you know even a little bit about a problem, 
write it down. The answer may come to you as 
you work on it, or you may get partial credit. 
Don't spend too Long on anyone problem.
If you can't solve a problem, make a guess.
Do not change it unless you find an obvious 
mistake.
Have a good reason for changing an answer. 
Your first guess is usually your best bet.
Check that the answer to an application 
problem is reasonable and makes sense.
Reread the problem. Make sure you've answered 
the question.
Use common sense. Can the father really be 
seven years old? Would a month's rent be 
$32,140? Label answers, if needed: $, years, 
inches, etc.
Check for careless errors. Rework each prob­
lem without looking at your previous work.
Then compare the two answers.
Reworking a problem from the beginning forces 
you to rethink it. If possible, use a different 
method to solve the problem.
Now Try This
Think through and answer each question.

• Clear any parentheses.
• Clear any fractions or decimals.
• Combine like terms.
Step 2 
Isolate the variable terms on one side.
Step 3 
Isolate the variable (here x )  to write the inequality in
one of these forms, where k is a constant.
x  < k, 
x  ^  k, 
x  > k, or 
x  ^  k
If an inequality is multiplied or divided by a negative number, 
then the direction of the inequality symbol must be reversed.

Figure 1
Locating a fly 
on a ceiling
The line graph in Figure 1 presents information based on a method for 
locating a point in a plane developed by Rene Descartes, a 17th-century 
French mathematician. According to legend, Descartes was lying in bed ill 
watching a fly crawl about on the ceiling near a comer of the room. It 
occurred to him that the location of the fly could be described by determin­
ing its distances from the two adjacent walls. See the figure in the margin.
We use this insight to plot points and graph linear equations in two vari­
ables whose graphs are straight lines.
Rene Descartes 
(1596-1650)
OBJECTIVE
Q  Plot ordered pairs. Each of the pairs of numbers
(3,2), 
(-5 ,6 ), 
and 
(4 ,-1 )
is an example of an ordered pair—that is, a pair of numbers written within 
parentheses. The order in which the numbers are written is important. We 
graph an ordered pair using two perpendicular number lines that intersect at 
their 0 points, as shown in Figure 2. The common 0 point is the origin.
The position of any point in this plane is determined by referring 
to the horizontal number line, or x-axis, and the vertical number line, or 
y-axis. The x-axis and the y-axis make up a rectangular (or Cartesian, for 
Descartes) coordinate system.
y
\ x-axis!
Rectangular coordinate system
Figure 2
www.ebook3000.com

Section 3.1 The Rectangular Coordinate System 163
The numbers in an ordered pair are its 
components. The first component indicates 
position relative to the x-axis, and the second 
component indicates position relative to the 
y-axis.
For example, to locate, or plot, the point 
on the graph that corresponds to the ordered 
pair (3, 2), we move 3 units from 0 to the 
right along the x-axis and then 2 units up par­
allel to the y-axis. See Figure 3. The numbers 
in an ordered pair are the coordinates of the 
corresponding point.
We can apply this method of locating ordered pairs to the line graph in 
Figure 1. We move along the horizontal axis to a year and then up parallel to 
the vertical axis to approximate spending for that year. Thus, we can write 
the ordered pair (2013, 2440) to indicate that in 2013, personal spending on 
medical care was about $2440 billion.
O  CAUTION
The parentheses used with an ordered pair are also used to represent an 
open interval. The context of the discussion tells whether ordered pairs 
or open intervals are being represented.

OBJECTIVE JQ  Find ordered pairs that satisfy a given equation. Each
solution to an equation with two variables, such as
2x + 3y = 6, 
Equation with two variables x and y
will include two numbers, one for each variable. To keep track of which 
number goes with which variable, we write the solutions as ordered pairs. 
(If x and y are used as the variables, the x-value is given first.) For example, 
we can show that (6, — 2) is a solution of 2x + 3y = 6 by substitution.
Use parentheses 
to avoid errors.
2x + 3y = 6
2(6) + 3 ( —2) =6

6 =  6
Equation with two variables 
Let x = 6, y = —2.
Multiply.
/  True
Because the pair of numbers (6 ,-2 ) makes the equation true, it is a solution. 
On the other hand, (5,1) is not a solution of 2x + 3y = 6.
2x + 3y = 6
2(5) + 3 (1 ) = 6  
Let jc = 5,y = 1.
10 + 3 = 6 
Multiply.
13 = 6 
False
To find ordered pairs that satisfy an equation, we select any number for 
either one of the variables, substitute it into the equation for that variable, 
and then solve for the other variable.

Section 3.1 The Rectangular Coordinate System 165
The equation 2x + 3y = 6 is a first-degree equation because it has no 
term with a variable to a power greater than one.
The graph o f any first-degree equation in two variables is a 
straight line.
Since first-degree equations with two variables have straight-line graphs, 
they are called linear equations in two variables.
Linear Equation in Two Variables
A linear equation in two variables (here x andy) can be written in the 
form
Ax + By = C,
where A, B, and Care real numbers, and A and B are not both 0. This form 
is called standard form.
Examples: 
3x + 4y = 9, x -  y = 0, 
and x + 2y = — 8
OBJECTIVE
O  Find x- and y-intercepts. A straight line is determined if 
any two different points on the line are known. Therefore, finding two differ­
ent points is sufficient to graph the line.
Two useful points for graphing are the x- and y-intercepts. The x-intercept 
is the point (if any) where the line intersects the x-axis. They-intercept is the 
point (if any) where the line intersects the y-axis.* See Figure 5.
y
Figure 5
Notice the following.
• The y-value of the point where a line intersects the x-axis is always 0.
• The x-value of the point where a line intersects the y-axis is always 0. 
This suggests a method for finding the x- and y-intercepts.
Finding Intercepts
When graphing the equation of a line, find the intercepts as follows.
Let y = 0 to find thex-intercept.
Letx = 0 to find they-intercept.
*Some texts define an intercept as a number, not a point. For example, “^-intercept (0, 4 )” would be given 
as “^-intercept 4.”

EXAMPLE 2
Finding Intercepts
Find the r- and y-intercepts of 4x — y = — 3, and graph the equation.
To find the ^-intercept, let y = 0
4x — y = — 3
4x — 0 = —3 
Let y = 0.
4x = —3
Subtract.
3
x = — — 
Divide by 4.
The x-intercept is ( — f , 0 ).
To find the y-intercept, let x = 0
4x — y = — 3 
4 ( 0 ) — y = ~ 3 
Letjc = 0.
—y = — 3 
Subtract.
y = 3
Multiply by — 1
The y-intercept is (0,3).
To guard against errors when graphing the equation, it is a good idea 
to find a third point. We arbitrarily choose x = —2 and substitute this value 
in the equation to find the corresponding value of y.
4x — y = — 3
4 ( — 2 ) — y —— 3 
Let x = —2.
—8 — y = — 3 
Multiply.
—y = 5
Add 8.
y = — 5 
Multiply by — 1.
The ordered pair ( — 2, —5) lies on the graph. We plot the three ordered 
pairs and draw a line through them. See Figure 6.
A linear equation with both 
x and y variables will have 
both x- and y-intercepts. Its 
graph will be a “slanted” line.
< Work Problem Q  at the Side.
Some lines have both the x- and y-intercepts at the origin.
EXAMPLE 3
Graphing a Line That Passes through the Origin
Graph x + 2y = 0.
Find the x-intercept.
x + 2y = 0 
x + 2 (0) = 0 
Let y = 0. 
jc + 0 = 0 
Multiply.
x = 0 
x-intercept is (0, 0)
Find the y-intercept. 
x + 2y = 0
0 + 2y = 0 
Let x = 0.
2y = 0 
Add.
y = 0 y-intercept is (0, 0).

Section 3.1 The Rectangular Coordinate System 167
Both intercepts are the same ordered pair, (0,0), which means that the graph 
passes through the origin. To find a second point to graph the line, choose 
any nonzero number for x or y and solve for the other variable. We arbitrarily 
choose x = 4.

Divide by 2.
This gives the ordered pair (4, —2). As a final check, verify that the 
ordered pair (—2, 1) also lies on the line. The graph is shown in Figure 7.

ANALYZING YOUR TEST RESULTS
A  n exam is a learning opportunity—learn from your mistakes. After a test is 
A A  returned, do the following:
► Note what you got wrong and why you had points deducted.
► Figure out how to solve the problems you missed. Check your text or notes, or 
ask your instructor. Rework the problems correctly.
► Keep all quizzes and tests that are returned to you. Use them to study for future 
tests and the final exam.
Typical Reasons fo r Errors on M ath Tests
1. You read the directions wrong.
2. You read the question wrong or skipped over something.
3. You made a computation error.
4. You made a careless error. (For example, you incorrectly copied a correct 
answer onto a separate answer sheet.)
5. Your answer was not complete.
6. You Labeled your answer wrong. (For example, you labeled an answer "ft" 
instead of "ft2".)
7. You didn't show your work.
8. You didn't understand a concept.
9. You were unable to set up the problem (in an application).
10. You were unable to apply a procedure.
These are test-taking errors. They are 
easy to correct if you read carefully, 
show all your work, proofread, and 
double-check units and Labels.
These are test preparation errors.
Be sure to practice all the kinds of 
problems that you will see on tests.

3.2 The Slope of a Line
OBJECTIVES
Q  Find the slope of a line given two 
points on the line.
Q  Find the slope of a line given an 
equation of the line.
O  Graph a line given its slope and a 
point on the line.
O  Use slopes to determine whether 
two lines are parallel, perpendicular, 
or neither.
©  Solve problems involving average 
rate of change.
Slope (steepness) is used in many practical ways. The slope of a highway 
(sometimes called the grade) is often given as a percent. For example,
a 10% ( or 
= j^j) slope means the highway rises 1 vertical unit for every
10 horizontal units. Stairs and roofs have slopes too, as shown in Figure 11.
Figure 11
Slope is the ratio of vertical change, or rise, to horizontal change, or run. 
A simple way to remember this is to think, “Slope is rise over run.”
o Use the information given in 
the figure to find the following.
(a) The rise
(b) The run
OBJECTIVE
o  Find the slope of a line given two points on the line. To
obtain a formal definition of the slope of a line, we designate two different 
points on the line as (jq, yi) and (*2, y2)- See Figure 12.

(*2^ 2)
Figure 12
As we move along the line in Figure 12 from (xi, yi) to (*2, y2), they-value 
changes (vertically) from yi to y2, an amount equal to y2 — yi. As y changes 
from yi to y2, the value of x changes (horizontally) from x\ to X2 by the amount
x 2 ~  X \.
The ratio of the change in y to the change in x (the rise over the run, or 
^ )  is the slope of the line, with the letter m traditionally used for slope.
Slope Formula
(c) The slope
The slope m of the Line passing through the distinct points (*i,yi) and 
(*2,y 2) is defined as follows.
m = rise _  change iny _  y2 -  yi

OBJECTIVE
Find the slope of a line given an equation of the line.
When an equation of a line is given, one way to find the slope is to use the 
definition of slope with two different points on the line.
EXAMPLE 2
Finding the Slope of a Line
Find the slope of the line 4x — y = — 8.
The intercepts can be used as the two points needed to find the slope. Let 
y = 0 to find that the x-intercept is (—2, 0). Then let x = 0 to find that the 
y-intercept is (0, 8). Use these two points in the slope formula.

Horizontal and Vertical Lines
• An equation of the form y  = b always intersects they-axis atthe point 
(0, b). A line with that equation is horizontal and has slope 0.
• An equation of the form x = a always intersects the x-axis atthe point

Section 3.2 The Slope of a Line 179
The slope of a line can also be found directly from its equation. Consider 
the equation Ax — y = — 8 from Example 2. Solve this equation for y.
Ax -  y = -8
Equation from Example 2
Going forward, 
we combine 
these steps.
—y = —8 — Ax 
- y  = -A x -  8
Subtract Ax. 
Commutative property
y = Ax + 8 
Multiply by -1.
The slope, 4, found using the slope formula in Example 2, is the same 
number as the coefficient of x in the equation y = Ax + 8. We will see in the 
next section that this always happens, as long as the equation is solved for y.

In Example 5(a), the slope of the line is the positive number 3. The
graph of the line in Figure 16 slants up (rises) from left to right. The line in 
Example 5(b) has negative slope, —4. As Figure 17 shows, its graph slants 
down (falls) from left to right.
These facts suggest the following generalization.
Orientation of a Line in the Plane
A positive slope indicates that a Line slants up (rises) from Left to right.
A negative slope indicates that a Line slants down (falls) from Left to right.

To see how the slopes of perpendicu­
lar lines are related, consider a nonverti­
cal line with slope §. If this line is rotated 
90°, the vertical change and the horizontal 
change are interchanged and the slope is
— |  because the horizontal change is now
negative. See Figure 20. Thus, the slopes of 
perpendicular lines have product — 1 and are 
negative reciprocals of each other.

OBJECTIVE !0 Solve problems involving average rate of change. The
slope formula applied to any two points on a line gives the average rate of 
change in y per unit change in x, where the value of y depends on the value 
of x.
For example, suppose the height of a boy increased from 60 to 68 in. 
between the ages of 12 and 16, as shown in Figure 21.
Change in height y -> 68 — 60 
8
—------- = — = 2 in. per yr
Change in age x ---- > 16 — 12 
4
The boy may have grown more than 2 in. during 
some years and less than 2 in. during others. If 
we plotted ordered pairs (age, height) for those 
years and drew a line connecting any two of the 
points, the average rate of change would likely 
be slightly different than that found above. How­
ever using the data for ages 12 and 16, the boy’s 
average change in height was 2 in. per year over 
these years.

OBJECTIVE
O  Write an equation of a line given its slope andy-intercept.
Recall that we can find the slope of a line from the equation of the line by 
solving the equation for y. For example, the slope of the line with equation
y = 4x + 8
is 4, the coefficient of x. What does the number 8 represent?
To find out, suppose a line has slope m and y-intercept (0, b). We can 
find an equation of this line by choosing another point (x, y) on the line, as 
shown in Figure 24, and applying the slope formula.
y — b <
y - b
m = -------
x
mx = y — b 
mx + b = y
y =  mx +  b
Change in y 
Change in x
Subtract.
Multiply by x. 
Add b.
Interchange sides.
y
This last equation is the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line, 
because we can identify the slope m and y-intercept (0, b) at a glance. 
Thus, in the line with equation y = 4x + 8, the number 8 indicates that the 
y-intercept is (0, 8).
Q  Write an equation for each line 
with the given slope and 
y-intercept.

Note
Every Linear equation (of a nonverticalline) has a unique (one and only one) 
slope-intercept form. Later in this chapter, we study linear functions, which 
are defined using slope-intercept form. Also, this is the form used when 
graphing a line with a graphing calculator.

I Graphing Lines Using Slope andy-intercept
Graph each line using its slope and y-intercept.
(a) y = 3x — 6

Here m = 3 and b = — 6. Plot the y-intercept (0, — 6). The slope 3 can

From (0 ,-6 ), move 3 units up and 1 unit to the right, and plot a second 
point at (1, —3). Join the two points with a straight line. See Figure 25.
(b) 3y + 2x = 9 (Not in slope-intercept form)
Write the equation in slope-intercept form by solving for y.
3y + 2x = 9
3y = — 2x + 9

Write an equation of the line passing through the point (—3, 3) that satisfies 
the given condition.
(a) The line has slope 0.
Because the slope is 0, this is a horizontal 
line. A horizontal line through the point (a, b) has 
equation y = b. In (—3, 3), the y-coordinate is 3, 
so the equation is y = 3.
(b) The line has undefined slope.
This is a vertical line, because the slope is 
undefined. A vertical line through the point (a, b) 
has equation x = a. In ( — 3, 3), the x-coordinate 
is — 3, so the equation is x = — 3.

Slope is — f  (B 7^ 0).
x-intercept is (j , 0)
(A 7^ 0).
y-intercept is (0, §)
(B 7^ 0).
The x- and y-intercepts can 
be found quickly and used 
to graph the equation. The 
slope must be calculated.

(b) A cell phone plan costs

(c) Interpret the ordered pair

OBJECTIVE o Write an equation of a line that models real data. If a
given set of data changes at a fairly constant rate, the data may fit a linear 
pattern, where the rate of change is the slope of the line.
EXAMPLE 7
Writing a Linear Equation to Describe Data
A local gasoline station is selling 89-octane gas for $3.50 per gal.
(a) Write an equation that describes the cost y to buy x gallons of gas.
The total cost is determined by the number of gallons we buy multiplied 
by the price per gallon (in this case, $3.50). As the gas is pumped, two sets 
of numbers spin by:
the number of gallons pumped and the cost of that number of gallons.
The table illustrates this situation.
Number of 
Gallons Pumped
Cost of This 
Number of Gallons
0
0 ($ 3 .5 0 ) =  $ 0.00
1
1 ($ 3 .5 0 ) =  $ 3.50
2
2 ($ 3 .5 0 ) =  $ 7.00
3
3 ($ 3 .5 0 ) =  $10.50
4
4 ($ 3 .5 0 ) =  $14.00
If we let x denote the number of gallons pumped, then the total cost y in 
dollars can be found using the following linear equation.
Total cost
r
y = 3.50*
Number of gallons
Theoretically, there are infinitely many ordered pairs (jc, y) that satisfy this 
equation, but here we are limited to nonnegative values for x because we 
cannot have a negative number of gallons. There is also a practical maxi­
mum value for x in this situation, which varies from one car to another—the 
size of the gas tank.
(b) A car wash at this gas station costs an additional $3.00. Write an equa­
tion that defines the cost of gas and a car wash.
The cost will be 3.50* + 3.00 dollars for* gallons of gas and a car wash.
y = 3.5x + 3 
Final 0’s need not be included.
(c) Interpret the ordered pairs (5, 20.5) and (10, 38) in relation to the equa­
tion from part (b).
(5, 20.5) indicates that 5 gal of gas and a car wash cost $20.50.
(10, 38) indicates that 10 gal of gas and a car wash cost $38.00.

Answers

(b) y = 85* + 100
(c) The ordered pair (11, 1035) indicates 
that the cost for 11 months of service is 
$1035.
Note
In Example 7(a), the ordered pair (0, 0) satisfied the equation, so 
the linear equation has the form y =  mx, where b =  0. If a situation 
involves an initial charge b plus a charge per unit m as in Example 7(b), 
the equation has the form y = mx + b, where b #  0.

(Sf3435)
(a) Write an equation that models the data.
Because the points in Figure 32 lie approximately on a straight line, we 
can write a linear equation that models the relationship between year x and 
costy. We choose two data points, (0, 2938) and (5, 3435), to find the slope 
of the line.
3435 -  2938 
5 - 0
= 99.4
The slope 99.4 indicates that the cost of tuition and fees increased by about 
$99 per year from 2010 to 2015. We use this slope and the y-intercept 
(0, 2938) to write an equation of the line in slope-intercept form.
y = 99.4* + 2938
(b) Use the equation from part (a) to approximate the cost of tuition and fees 
in 2016.
The value x = 6 corresponds to the year 2016.
y = 99.4jc + 2938 
Equation from part (a)
y = 99.4 (6) + 2938 
Substitute 6 for x.
y = 3534.4 
Multiply, and then add.
According to the model, average tuition and fees for in-state students at public 
two-year colleges in 2016 were about $3534.

Relating Concepts (Exercises 89-96) For Individual or Group Work
To see how the formula that relates Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures is derived, 
work Exercises 89-96 in order.
89. There is a linear relationship between Celsius and
Fahrenheit temperatures. When C = 0°, F = _______°,
and when C = 100°, F = ______ °.
90. Think of ordered pairs of temperatures (C, F), where C 
and F represent corresponding Celsius and Fahrenheit 
temperatures. The equation that relates the two scales 
has a straight-line graph that contains the two points 
determined in Exercise 89.
(a) What are these two points?
(b) Find the slope of the line described in part (a).
91. Use the slope found in Exercise 90(b) and one 
of the two points determined earlier, and write an 
equation that gives F in terms of C. (Hint: Use the 
point-slope form, where C replaces x and F 
replaces y.)
92. To obtain another form of the formula, use the 
equation found in Exercise 91 and solve for C in 
terms of F. For what temperature does F = C? 
(Use the photo to confirm this temperature.)
93. A quick way to estimate Fahrenheit temperature for a 
given Celsius temperature is to double C and add 30. 
Use this method to estimate F if C = 15.
94. Use the equation found in Exercise 91 to find F if 
C = 15. How does the answer compare with the 
answer to Exercise 93?
95. Use the method given in Exercise 93 to estimate the 
Fahrenheit temperature given C = 30. Then use the 
equation from Exercise 91 to find F when C = 30. 
How do the temperatures compare?
96. Explain why the method given in Exercise 93 to 
estimate Fahrenheit temperature gives a good

3.4 Linear Inequalities in Two Variables
OBJECTIVE ! o  Graph linear inequalities in two variables. We have graphed
linear inequalities in one variable on a number line. We graph linear inequali­
ties in two variables on a rectangular coordinate system in this section.
Linear Inequality in Two Variables
A linear inequality in two variables (here x and y) can be written in the 
form
Ax + By <  C, Ax + By ^  C, Ax + By >  C, or Ax 4- By ^  C,
where A, B, and Care real numbers and A and B are not both 0.
OBJECTIVES
o Graph linear inequalities in two 
variables.
Q  Graph the intersection of two linear 
inequalities.
O  Graph the union of two linear 
inequalities.
Consider the graph in Figure 33. The graph of the line x + y = 5 divides 
the points in the rectangular coordinate system into three sets of points.
y
1. Those points that he on the line itself and satisfy the equation x + y = 5 
[such as (0 , 5), (2, 3), and (5 ,0 ) ]
2. Those points that he in the region above the hne and satisfy the inequahty 
x + y > 5 [such as (5, 3) and (2, 4) ]
3. Those points that he in the region below the hne and satisfy the inequahty 
x + y <  5 [ such as (0 , 0 ) and (—3, — 1) ]
The graph of the hne x + y = 5 is the boundary line for the two inequalities
x + y > 5 
and 
x + y <  5.
A graph o f a linear inequality in two variables is a region in the real num­
ber plane that may or may not include the boundary line.
Graphing a Linear Inequality in Two Variables
Step 1 
Draw the graph of the straight line that is the boundary.
• Make the line solid if the inequality involves <  or > .
• Make the line dashed if the inequality involves <  or > .
Step 2 
Choose a test point. Choose any point not on the line, and sub­
stitute the coordinates of this point in the inequality.
Step 3 
Shade the appropriate region. Shade the region that includes
the test point if it satisfies the original inequality. Otherwise, 
shade the region on the other side of the boundary line.

EXAMPLE 1
Graphing a Linear Inequality
Graph 3x + 2y >  6.
Step 1 
First graph the boundary line 3x + 2y = 6, which has intercepts
(2, 0) and (0, 3), as shown in Figure 34.
Step 2
Step 3
The graph of the inequality 3x + 2y > 6 includes the points of 
the boundary line 3x + 2y = 6 (because the inequality symbol >  
includes equality) and either the points above the line or the points 
below it. To decide which, select any point not on the boundary line 
as a test point. Substitute the values from the test point, here (0, 0), 
for jc and y in the inequality.
(0, 0)isa 
convenient 
test point.
3x + 2y > 6
We are testing the region 
below the boundary line.
3(0) + 2 (0 ) ^>6 
Let x = 0 and y = 0.
0 >  6 
False
Because the result is false, (0, 0) does not satisfy the inequality. 
The solution set includes all points on the other side of the line. This 
region is shaded in Figure 35.
As a further check, select a test point 
in the shaded region, say (3, 0).
3x + 2y > 6 
Test the region.
3(3) + 2(0) >  6
Let x — 3 and 
y = 0.
9 + 0 >  6 
Multiply.
9 >  6 /  True
The check confirms that the correct 
region is graphed.
Figure 35 
◄ Work Problem Q  at the Side,
If the inequality is written in the form y > mx + b or y < mx + b, the 
inequality symbol indicates which region to shade.
• If y > mx + b, shade above the boundary line.
• If y < mx + b, shade below the boundary line.
This method works only if the inequality is solved fo r y.

! EXAMPLE 2
Graphing a Linear Inequality with Boundary Passing 
through the Origin
Graph 3x — 4y > 0.
Graph the boundary line. The x- and y-intercepts are the same point 
(0, 0), so this line passes through the origin. Two other points on the line are 
(4, 3) and (—4, —3). The points of the boundary line do not belong to the in­
equality 3x — 4y > 0 (because the inequality symbol is > , not ^ ). For this 
reason, the line is dashed.
Now solve the inequality for y.
3x — 4y > 0 
Original inequality
Use this equivalent 
inequality to 
deride which 
region to shade.
—4y >  -3 x

y < - x
Subtract 3x.
Divide by —4. Change > to <.
Because the is less than symbol occurs when the original inequality is 
solved fory, shade below the line. See Figure 36.
CHECK Choose a test point not on the line, which 
rules out the origin. We choose (2, — 1).
3x — 4y > 0

Relating Concepts (Exercises 51-56) For Individual or Group Work
Linear programming is a method for finding the optimal (best possible) solution that 
meets all the conditions for a problem like the following.
A factory can have no more than 200 workers on a shift, but must have at least 100 
and must manufacture at least 3000 units at minimum cost. How many workers 
should be on a shift in order to produce the required units at minimal cost?
Let x represent the number of workers and y represent the number of units 
manufactured. Work Exercises 51-56 in order.
51. Write three inequalities expressing the problem conditions.
52. Graph the inequalities from Exercise 51 and shade the 
intersection.

Section 3.5 Introduction to Relations and Functions 215
Function
A function is a relation in which, for each distinct value of the first 
component of the ordered pairs of the relation, there is exactly one value 
of the second component.
EXAMPLE 2
Determining Whether Relations Are Functions
Determine whether each relation defines a function.
(a) F
=  {(1,2), (-2 ,4 ), (3, -1 )}
Look at the ordered pairs that defined this relation.
For x = 1, there is only one value of y, 2.
For x = — 2, there is only one value of y, 4.
For x = 3, there is only one value of y, — 1.
Relation F is a function—for each distinct x-value, there is exactly one 
y-value.
(b) G = {(-2, -1 ), (-1 . 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2)}
Relation G is also a function. Although the last two ordered pairs have the 
same y-value (1 is paired with 2, and 2 is paired with 2), this does not violate 
the definition of a function. The first components (x-values) are distinct, and 
each is paired with only one second component (y-value).
(c) H =  { (-4 ,1 ), (-2 ,1 ), (-2 ,0 )}
In relation H, the last two ordered pairs have the same x-value paired with 
two different y-values (—2 is paired with both 1 and 0). H is a relation, but 
not a function.
In a function, no two ordered pairs have the same first component 
and different second components.

Work Problem Q  at the Side. ►
Relations may be defined in several different ways.
• A relation may be defined as a set of ordered pair. (See Example 2.)
RelationF = {(1, 2), (—2, 4), (3, —1)} 
Function 
Relation H = {(—4, 1), (—2, 1), (—2, 0)} 
Not a function
• A relation may be defined as a correspondence or mapping.
See Figure 40. In the mapping for relation F from Example 2(a), 
1 is mapped to 2, —2 is mapped to 4, and 3 is mapped to —1. Thus, F is a 
function—each first component of an ordered pair is paired with exactly 
one second component.
In the mapping for relation H from Example 2(c), which is not a function, 
the first component —2 is paired with two different second components.

• A relation may be defined as a graph.

• A relation may be defined as an equation (or rule).
The solutions of an equation give an infinite 
set of ordered pairs. For example, if the value 
of y is twice the value of x, the equation is
y = 2x.
There are an infinite number of ordered-pair 
solutions (x, y), which can be represented by 
the graph in Figure 42.
In the equation y = 2x, the value of y 
depends on the value of x. Thus, the variable 
y is the dependent variable. The variable x is 
the independent variable.
y
y = 2x
Figure 42
Dependent variable —> y = 2x 
Independent variable
An equation tells how to determine the value of the dependent variable for a 
specific value of the independent variable.
Note
An equation that describes the relationship given at the beginning of 
this section between number of hours worked and paycheck amount is
y  =  8x. 
8 represents the hourly rate, $8.
Paycheck amounty depends on number of hours worked x. Thus, pay- 
check amount is the dependent variable, and number of hours worked is 
the independent variable.
In a function, there is exactly one value o f the dependent variable, the 
second component, for each value o f the independent variable, the first 
component.
Note
Another way to think of a function relation­
ship is to think of the independent variable 
as an input and the dependent variable as 
an output. This input-output (function) 
machine illustrates the relationship between 
number of hours worked and paycheck 
amount.

OBJECTIVE
Q  Find the domain and range.
Section 3.5 Introduction to Relations and Functions 217
Domain and Range
For every relation defined by a set of ordered pairs (x, y), there are two 
important sets of elements.
• The set of all values of the independent variable (x) is the domain.
• The set of all values of the dependent variable (y) is the range.
o  Give the domain and range of 
each relation. Decide whether 
the relation defines a function.
(a) {(2, 2), (2, 5), (4, 8)}
EXAMPLE 3
Finding Domains and Ranges of Relations
Give the domain and range of each relation. Decide whether the relation 
defines a function.
(a) {(3, -1 ), (4, 2), (4, 5), (6, 8)}
List 4 only once.
Domain: {3,4,6} 
Set of x-values
Range: 
{ — 1, 2, 5, 8} 
Set of y-values
This relation is not a function because the same x-value 4 is paired with 
two different y-values, 2 and 5.
(b)
The components 
in a relation do 
not need to be 
numerical.
This mapping represents the following set of ordered pairs 
{(95, A), (89, B), (88, B), (78, C)}
Domain: {95, 89, 88, 78} 
Set of first components
Range: 
{A, B, C}
Set of second components
The mapping defines a function—each domain value corresponds to exactly 
one range value.

220 Chapter 3 
Graphs, Linear Equations, and Functions
If a relation is defined by an equation involving a fraction or a radical, 
apply these guidelines when finding its domain.
1. Exclude from the domain any values that make the denominator of a 
fraction equal to 0.
Example: 
The function y = \  has the set of all real numbers except 0 as 
its domain because division by 0 is undefined.
2. Exclude from the domain any values that result in an even root of a 
negative number.
Example: 
The function y = V x  has the set of all nonnegative real num­
bers as its domain because the square root of a negative number is not real.
Agreement on Domain
Unless specified otherwise, the domain of a relation is assumed to be all 
real numbers that produce real numbers when substituted for the inde­
pendent variable.
EXAMPLE 6
Identifying Functions from Their Equations
Decide whether each relation defines y as a function of x. Give the domain.
(a) y = x + 4
In this equation, y is found by adding 4 to x. Thus, each value of x cor­
responds to just one value of y, and the relation defines a function. Because 
x can be any real number, the domain is (—00, 00).
(b) y = V 2 x  -  1
For any choice of x in the domain, there is exactly one corresponding 
value for y. (The radical is a single nonnegative number.) This equation 
defines a function. The quantity under the radical symbol cannot be 
negative—that is, 2x — 1 must be greater than or equal to 0.
A dd 1. D ivide by 2.
The domain of the function is 
oo).
(c) y2 = x
The ordered pairs (16, 4) and (1 6 ,-4 ) both satisfy this equation. One 
value of x, 16, corresponds to two values of y, 4 and —4, so this equation 
does not define a function. Because x is equal to the square of y, the values 
of x must always be nonnegative. The domain is [ 0, oo).
(d) y <  x -  1
By definition, y is a function of x if every value of x leads to exactly one 
value of y. Here a particular value of x, such as 1, corresponds to many values 
of y. The ordered pairs
(1,0), 
(1 ,-1 ), 
(1 ,-2 ), 
(1 ,-3 ), 
and so on,
all satisfy the inequality. Thus, this relation does not define a function. Any 
number can be used for x, so the domain is the set of real numbers, (—00, 00).

Section 3.5 Introduction to Relations and Functions 221
(e) y =
5
x -  1
Given any value of x in the domain, we find y by subtracting 1 and then 
dividing the result into 5. This process produces exactly one value of y for 
each value in the domain, so the given equation defines a function. The 
domain includes all real numbers except those that make the denominator 0.
x — 1 = 0 
Set the denominator equal to 0. 
x = 1 
Add 1.
The domain includes all real numbers except 1, written (— oo, 1) u (1, o°).

Function Notation and Linear Functions 225
3.6 Function Notation and Linear Functions
OBJECTIVE o Use function notation. When a function f  is defined with 
a rule or an equation using x and y for the independent and dependent vari­
ables, we say “y is a function of x” to emphasize that y depends on x. We use 
the notation y = /(x ), called function notation, to express this and read 
f(x) as 66f  o f x ” or “/  at x.” The letter /  is a name for this particular function.
For example, if y = 9x — 5, we can name this function f  and write
OBJECTIVES
o Use function notation, 
e Graph linear and constant functions,
/(x ) = 9x -  5.
f  is the name of the function. 
x is a value from the domain. 
f(x) is the function value (or y- value) 
that corresponds to x.
f(x ) is just another name fo r the dependent variable y.
We evaluate a function at different values of x by substituting x-values 
from the domain into the function.
EXAMPLE 1
Evaluating a Function
Let f(x) = 9x — 5. Find the value of function/for each value of x. 
(a) x = 2
Read/(2) as "/of 2" 
or " /a t 2".
f(x) = 9 x - 5  
/ ( 2) = 9 * 2  — 5 
/(2 ) = 1 8 - 5
/ ( 2) = 13
Given function 
Replace x with 2. 
Multiply. 
Subtract.
Thus, for x = 2, the corresponding function value (or y-value) is 13. 
/(2 ) = 13 is an abbreviation for the statement “If x = 2 in the function f, 
then y = 13” and is represented by the ordered pair (2 ,13).
(b) x = -3
/(* ) = 9 , - 5  
|Use parentheses 
avoid errors.
/(  — 3) = 9 ( — 3) — 5 
Replace x with —3
/ ( -  3) = - 3 2
Multiply, and then subtract.
Thus, /( — 3) = — 32 and the ordered pair ( — 3, — 32) belongs to f.

OCAUTION
The symbol f(x) does not indicate "/tim es x," but represents they-value 
associated with the indicated x-value. As shown in Example 1(a), /( 2 )  is

Introduction to Relations and Functions
y
A relation is any set of ordered pairs (xty). A function is 
a set of ordered pairs in which, for each distinct value of 
the first component, there is exactly one value of the second 
component.
The set of first components (x-values) is the domain.
The set of second components (y-values) is the range.
The set of ordered pairs {(—1,4), (0, 6), (1,4)} defines a 
function.
Domain: {—1,0, 1} 
Set of x-values 
Range: {4,6} 
Set of y-values
The equation y = x2 defines a function.
Domain: (—°°, 00) 
Range: [0, o°)
Function Notation and Linear Functions
To evaluate a function /, where f(x) defines the range value 
for a given value of x in the domain, substitute the domain 
value wherever x appears.
Let f(x) = x2 — 7x + 12. Find /(l).
f{x) =x2- l x + \ 2
/(l) = l2-7 (1 ) + 12 
Let x = 1.
/ ( I ) - 6
To write an equation that defines 
notation, follow these steps.

Systems of Linear Equations
Just as the intersection of two streets consists of the region common to both, a solution 
of a system of two linear equations (represented graphically by lines) is an ordered pair 
found in the solution sets of both of the individual equations.

Figure 1
As shown beside Figure 1, we can use a linear equation to model the 
graph of the number of people who ran (red graph) and another linear equa­
tion to model the graph of the number of people who fished (blue graph). 
Such a set of equations is a system of equations—in this case, a linear 
system of equations. The point where the graphs in Figure 1 intersect is 
a solution of each of the individual equations. It is also the solution of the 
linear system of equations.
OBJECTIVE o Decide whether an ordered pair is a solution of a linear 
system. The solution set of a system of equations contains all ordered pairs 
that satisfy all the equations of the system at the same time.
EXAMPLE 1
Deciding Whether an Ordered Pair Is a Solution
Decide whether the given ordered pair is a solution of the given system.
(a) 
x + y = 6 
4 x —y =  14
(4, 2)
Replace * with 4 and y with 2 in each equation of the system.
x + y  = 6
4 + 2 = 6
6 = 6 /  True
4 x —y = 14 
4(4) -  2 = 14
16 -  2 = 14
1 4 = 1 4  /  True
Because (4, 2) makes both equations true, (4, 2) is a solution of the system.

3x + 2y = 11 
3 ( - l )  + 2(7) = 11
- 3  + 14 = 11
11 = 11 /  True
x + 5y = 36 
- 1  +  5 (7 ) =  36 
-1  + 35 = 36
34 = 36 
False
The ordered pair (—1, 7) is not a solution of the system—it does not make 
both equations true.

There are three possibilities for the number of elements in the solution 
set of a linear system in two variables.
Graphs of Linear Systems in Two Variables
Case 1 
The two graphs intersect in a single point.
The coordinates of this point give the only solution of the 
system. Because the system has a solution, it is consistent. 
The equations are not equivalent, so they are independent. See 
Figure 3(a).
Case 2 
The graphs are parallel lines.
There is no solution common to both equations, so the solution 
set is 0  and the system is inconsistent. Because the equations 
are not equivalent, they are independent. See Figure 3(b).
Case 3 
The graphs are the same line—that is, they coincide.
Because any solution of one equation of the system is a solution 
of the other, the solution set is an infinite set of ordered pairs 
representing the points on the line. This type of system is consis­
tent because there is a solution. The equations are equivalent, 
so they are dependent. See Figure 3(c).

OBJECTIVE
O  Solve linear systems (with two equations and two vari­
ables) by substitution. It can be difficult to read exact coordinates from a 
graph, especially if they are not integers, so we generally use algebraic meth­
ods to solve systems. One such method, the substitution method, is well 
suited for solving linear systems in which one equation is solved or can be 
easily solved for one variable in terms of the other.

(1)
x =  y +  2 
(2)
©  Solve each system, 
(a) lx  — 2y =  —2 
y = 3x
Equation (2) is solved for x, so we substitute y +  2 for x in equation (1)
2x — y =  6 
(1)
Substitute in the 
other equation.
Be sure to use 
parentheses here.
2 (y + 2) — y =  6 
Let x = y + 2.
2y + 4 — y = 6 
Distributive property
y + 4 = 6 
Combine like terms. 
y = 2 
Subtract 4.
Now we find jc by substituting 2 for y in either equation (1) or (2).
x = y + 2 
(2)
x = 2 + 2 
Let y = 2.
* = 4
Add.
Write thex-value first 
in the ordered pair.
Thus, x = 4 and y =  2, giving the ordered pair (4, 2). Check these values in 
both equations of the original system.

Be careful. Even though we foundy first in Example 3, thex-coordinate 
is always written first in the ordered-pair solution of a system.
Solving a Linear System by Substitution
Step 1 
Solve one of the equations for either variable. If one equation
has a variable term with coefficient 1 or -1 , choose it because 
the substitution method is usually easier.
Step2 Substitute for that variable in the other equation. The result
should be an equation with just one variable.
Step 3 Solve the equation from Step 2.
Step 4 
Find the other value. Substitute the result from Step 3 into the
equation from Step 1 and solve for the value of the other variable.
Step5 Check the values in both of the original equations. Then write
the solution set as a set containing an ordered pair.

By adding the equations in Example 6, we eliminated the variable y 
because the coefficients of the y-terms were opposites. In many cases the 
coefficients will not be opposites, and we must transform one or both equa­
tions so that the coefficients of one pair of variable terms are opposites.
Solving a Linear System by Elimination
Step 1 
Write both equations in the form Ax + By = C.
Step 2 Transform the equations as needed so that the coefficients
of one pair of variable terms are opposites. Multiply one or 
both equations by appropriate numbers so that the sum of the 
coefficients of either the x- ory-terms is 0.
Step 3 Add the new equations to eliminate a variable. The sum should
be an equation with just one variable.
Step 4 Solve the equation from Step 3 for the remaining variable.
Step5 
Find the other value. Substitute the result from Step 4 into
either of the original equations and solve for the other variable.
Step 6 Check the values in both of the original equations. Then write
the solution set as a set containing an ordered pair.

PREPARING FOR YOUR MATH FINAL EXAM
our math final exam is likely to be a comprehensive exam, 
which means it will cover material from the entire term. One 
way to prepare for it now is by working a set of Cumulative 
Review Exercises each time your class finishes a chapter. This 
continual review will help you remember concepts and procedures 
as you progress through the course.
Final Exam Preparation Suggestions
1. Figure out the grade you need to earn on the final exam to 
get the course grade you want. Check your course syllabus for 
grading policies, or ask your instructor if you are not sure.
2. Create a final exam week plan. Set priorities that allow you to 
spend extra time studying. This may mean making adjustments, 
in advance, in your work schedule or enlisting extra help with 
family responsibilities.
3. Use the following suggestions to guide your studying.
► Begin reviewing several days before the final exam.
DON'T wait until the last minute.
► Know exactly which chapters and sections will be 
covered.
► Divide up the chapters. Decide how much you will review 
each day.
► Keep returned quizzes and tests. Use them to review.
Practice all types of problems. Use the 
Cumulative Review Exercises at the end of each 
chapter in your text beginning in Chapter 2. All 
answers are given in the answer section.
► Review or rewrite your notes to create summaries 
of key information.
► Make study cards for all types of problems. Carry 
the cards with you, and review them whenever you 
have a few minutes.
Take plenty of short breaks as you study to 
reduce physical and mental stress. Exercising, 
listening to music, and enjoying a favorite activity 
are effective stress busters.

4.2 Systems of Linear Equations in Three Variables
OBJECTIVES
▼
Q  Understand the geometry of systems 
of three equations in three variables.
Q  Solve linear systems (with three 
equations and three variables) by 
elimination.
O  Solve linear systems (with three 
equations and three variables) in 
which some of the equations have 
missing terms.
O  Solve special systems.
A solution of an equation in three variables, such as
2x + 3y — z — 4, 
Linear equation in three variables
is an ordered triple and is written (jc,y,z). For example, the ordered triple 
(0,1, — 1) is a solution of the equation, because
2 (0) + 3 (1) — ( — 1) = 4 
is a true statement.
Verify that another solution of this equation is (10, —3, 7).
We now extend the term linear equation to equations of the form
Ax + By + Cz + •. • + Dw = K, 
where not all the coefficients A, B, C
, , D equal 0. For example,
2x + 3y — 5z = 7 
and x — 2y — z + 3m — 2w = 8
are linear equations, the first with three variables and the second with five.
OBJECTIVE
O  Understand the geometry of systems of three equations 
in three variables. Consider the solution of a system such as the following.
4x + 8y + z — 2
x + l y - 3 z  = - l 4
2x — 3y + 2z — 3
System of linear equations 
in three variables
Theoretically, a system of this type can be solved by graphing. However, the 
graph of a linear equation with three variables is a plane, not a line. Because 
visualizing a plane requires three-dimensional graphing, the graphing 
method is not practical with these systems. However, it does illustrate the 
number of solutions possible for such systems, as shown in Figure 6.

Section 4.2 Systems of Linear Equations in Three Variables 263
Figure 6  on the preceding page illustrates the following cases.
Graphs of Linear Systems in Three Variables
Case 1 
The three planes may meet at a single, common point.
This point is the solution set of the system. See Figure 6 (a).
Case 2 The three planes may have the points of a line in common.
The infinite set of points that satisfy the equation of the Line is 
the solution of the system. See Figures 6 (b) and (c).
Case 3 The three planes may coincide.
The solution set of the system is the set of all points in a plane. 
See Figure 6 (d).
Case 4 The planes may have no points common to all three.
There is no solution of the system. See Figures 6 (e)-(h).
OBJECTIVE ►© Solve linear systems (with three equations and three
variables) by elimination. Because graphing to find the solution set of a 
system of three equations in three variables is impractical, these systems are 
solved with an extension of the elimination method.
In the steps that follow, we use the term focus variable to identify the 
first variable to be eliminated. The focus variable will always be present in 
the working equation, which will be used twice to eliminate this variable.
Solving a Linear System in Three Variables*
Step 1 
Select a variable and an equation. A good choice forthe variable,
which we call the focus variable, is one that has coefficient 1 or 
—1. Then select an equation, one that contains the focus vari­
able, as the working equation.
Step 2 
Eliminate the focus variable. Use the working equation and one
of the other two equations of the original system. The result is an 
equation in two variables.
Step 3 
Eliminate the focus variable again. Use the working equation
and the remaining equation of the original system. The result is 
another equation in two variables.
Step 4 
Write the equations in two variables from Steps 2 and 3 as a
system, and solve it. Doing this gives the values of two of the 
variables.
Step 5 
Find the value of the remaining variable. Substitute the values
of the two variables found in Step 4 into the working equation to 
obtain the value of the focus variable.
Step 6 Check the three values in each of the original equations of the
system. Then write the solution set as a set containing an ordered 
triple.

suggestions here.

EXAMPLE 1
Solving a System in Three Variables
Solve the system.
4x + 8y + z — 2
(1)
x + 7y — 3z = —14 
(2)
2x — 3y + 2z — 3
(3)
Step 1
Because z in equation (1) has coefficient 1, we choose z as the focus 
variable and (1) as the working equation. (Another option would be 
to choose jc as the focus variable—it also has coefficient 1—and use 
(2) as the working equation.)
- Focus variable
nT
4x + 8y + z = 2 
(1) <—Working equation
Step 2 
Multiply working equation (1) by 3 and add the result to equation (2)
\2x + 24y + 3z — 
6 
Multiply each side of (1) by 3.
Focus variable 
zwas 
eliminated.
* +  7y —3z = —14
13x + 31 y
=  -8
(2)
Add.
(4)
Step 3 
Multiply working equation (1) by —2 and add the result to remain­
ing equation (3) to again eliminate focus variable z.
S x ~  16y — 2z = —4 
Multiply each side of (1) by —2.
Focus variable 
zwas 
eliminated.
2x — 3y + 2z — 
3
-6 x  -  19y
= - l
(3)
Add.
(5)
Step 4 Write the equations that result in Steps 2 and 3 as a system.
Make sure these 
equations have the 
same two variables.
13x + 31y = —8 
(4) 
The result from Step 2
—6x — 19y = — 1 
(5) 
The result from Step 3
Now solve this system. We choose to eliminate x.
78x + 186y = —48 
Multiply each side of (4) by 6.
—78x — 247y = —13 
Multiply each side of (5) by 13
—61y = —61 
Add.
y =  i
Divide by —61.
Substitute 1 for y in either equation (4) or (5) to find x.
- 6 x -  19y = - l
(5)
—6jc — 19 (1) = — 1 
Let y = 1
- 6 x -  19 = - l
- 6 i  = 18
Multiply. 
Add 19.
Step 5
x = — 3 
Divide by —6.
Now substitute the two values we found in Step 4 in working equa­
tion (1) to find the value of the remaining variable, focus variable z-
4x + 8y + z = 2 
(1)
4 ( —3) + 8 (1) + z — 2 
Let x = — 3 andy = 1.
—4 + z — 2 
Multiply, and then add.
Z = 6 
Add 4.

Section 4.2 Systems of Linear Equations in Three Variables 265
Write the values ofx,y, 
and zin the correct order
Step 6 
It appears that ( — 3 ,1, 6) is the only solution of the system. We must
check that this ordered triple satisfies all three original equations of 
the system. We begin with equation (1).
CHECK
4* + 8 y + z  = 2 
(1)
4 ( —3) + 8 (1) + 6  = 2 
Substitute.
-1 2  + 8 + 6 =  2
Multiply.
2 = 2 /  True
The check of these values in equations (2) and (3) is done similarly. 
Because (—3, 1, 6) satisfies all three original equations, the solution set is 
{(—3, 1, 6)}. This is Case 1, illustrated earlier in Figure 6 (a) and repeated 
in the margin.
---------------------------------------------------------Work Problem Q  at the Side. ►
OBJECTIVE
O  Solve linear systems (with three equations and three 
variables) in which some of the equations have missing terms.
EXAMPLE 2
Solving a System with Missing Terms
Solve the system.
6* — 12y = —5
(1)
Missing z
8y + 
z = 0
(2)
Missing *
9* — 
z — 12
(3)
Missing y
Because equation (3) is missing the variable y, one way to begin is to use 
y as the focus variable and eliminate y using equations (1) and (2).
Leave space for 
the missing 
terms.
12* -  24y

Note
Another way to solve the system in Example 2 is to begin by eliminating 
the variablez from equations (2) and (3). The resulting equation together 
with equation (1) forms a system of two equations in the variables* andy. 
Try working Example 2 this way to see that the same solution results.
There are often multiple ways to solve a system of equations. Some

When solving a system such as this, attempting to eliminate one variable 
results in elimination of all variables. The equations are dependent—that is, 
they are equivalent forms of the same equation—and have the same graph. 
This is Case 3, as illustrated in Figure 6 (d). The solution set is written
{(x, y, z) | 2x — 3y + 4z — 8}. 
Set-builder notation
Although any one of the three equations could be used to write the solution 
set, we use the equation with integer coefficients having greatest common 
factor 1 and positive coefficient of x, as in the previous section.

The resulting false statement indicates that equations (1) and (3) have no 
common solution. Thus, the system is inconsistent and the solution set is 0 . 
The graph of this system would show these two planes parallel to one 
another and a third plane that intersects both, as illustrated in Figure 6 (f). 
This is Case 4.

Note
If a false statement results when adding, as in Example 4, it is not neces­
sary to go any further with the solution. Because two of the three planes

Equations (1) and (2) are equivalent. If we multiply each side of equa­

have the same graph.
Equations (1) and (3) are not equivalent, however. If we multiply
equation (3) by ^» we obtain

This equation has the same coefficients as equation (1), but a different con­
stant term. Therefore, the graphs of equations (1) and (3) have no points in

Thus, this system is inconsistent and the solution set is 0 , as illustrated

4.3 Applications of Systems of Linear Equations
Although some problems with two unknowns can be solved using just one 
variable, it is often easier to use two variables and a system of equations. The 
following problem, which can be solved with a system, appeared in a Hindu
work that dates back to about a.d. 850. (See Exercise 19.)
The mixed price of 9 citrons (a lemon­
like fruit) and 7fragrant wood apples 
is 107; again, the mixed price of 
7 citrons and 9 fragrant wood apples 
is 101. O you arithmetician, tell me 
quickly the price of a citron and the 
price of a wood apple here, having 
distinctly separated those prices well.
OBJECTIVES
o Solve geometry problems using 
two variables.
Q  Solve money problems using 
two variables.
O  Solve mixture problems using 
two variables.
O  Solve distance-rate-time problems 
using two variables.
©  Solve problems with three 
variables using a system of 
three equations.
The following steps are based on the problem-solving method presented 
earlier in the text.
Solving an Applied Problem Using a System of Equations
Step 1 
Read the problem carefully. What information is given? What is to
befound?
Step 2 Assign variables to represent the unknown values. Write down
what each variable represents. Make a sketch, diagram, or table, 
as needed.
Step 3 Write a system of equations using all the variables.
Step 4 Solve the system of equations.
Step 5 State the answer. Label it appropriately. Does it seem reasonable?
Step 6 Check the answer in the words of the original problem.
Problem-Solving Hint
When solving an applied problem using two variables, it is a good idea 
to pick letters that correspond to the descriptions of the unknown 
quantities. In the opening problem above, we could choose
c to represent the number of citrons, 
and 
w to representthe number of wood apples.
OBJECTIVE 3o Solve geometry problems using two variables. Problems
about the perimeter of a geometric figure often involve two unknowns and 
can be solved using systems of equations.

(b) length: 210 ft; width: 100 ft
EXAMPLE 1
Finding the Dimensions of a Soccer Field
A rectangular soccer field may have a width between 50 and 100 yd and a 
length between 100 and 130 yd. One particular field has a perimeter of 320 yd. 
Its length measures 40 yd more than its width. What are the dimensions of 
this field? (Data from www.soccer-training-guide.com)
Step 1 
Read the problem again. We must find the dimensions of the field.
Step 2 
Assign variables. A sketch may be helpful, as in Figure 7.
Let L = the length 
and 
W = the width.
Step 3 
W rite a system of equations. Because the perimeter is 320 yd, we
find one equation using the perimeter formula.
2L + 2W = 320 
2L + 2W=P
For a second equation, use the information given about the length.
L = W + 40 
The length is 40 yd more than the width.
These two equations form a system of equations.
2L + 2W = 320 
(1)
L = W + 40 
(2)
Step 4 
Solve the system. Here equation (2) is solved for L, so we use the
substitution method, substituting W + 40 for L in equation (1) and 
solving for W.
2L + 2W = 320 
2 (W + 40) + 2W = 320
Be sure to use
parentheses around 
2W + 80 + 2W —  320
W+ 40.
4W + 80 = 320 
4 W = 240
Don't stop here. >  W =  60
(1)
Let L = W  + 40. 
Distributive property 
Combine like terms. 
Subtract 80.
Divide by 4.
Let W = 60 in the equation L = W + 40 to find L.
L = 60 + 40 = 100
Step 5 
State the answer. The length is 100 yd, and the width is 60 yd. Both
dimensions are within the ranges given in the problem.
Step 6 
Check using the words of the problem.
2 ( 1
0
0 ) +2(60) = 320 
The perimeter is 320 yd, as required.
100 — 60 = 40 
Length is 40 yd more than width, as required.
-----------------------------------------------------------◄ Work Problem Q  at the Side.
Problem-Solving Hint
In Step 3 of Example 1, we might write the second equation as
W = L -  40. 
(2)
In this case, we would substitute L — 40 for Win equation (1) to obtain
2L + 2(L — 40) = 320 
Let W = L -  40.
and solve for L first (instead of W, as in Step 4 above). The same answer 
results.

Q  Solve money problems using two variables.
EXAMPLE 2
Solving a Problem about Ticket Prices
Step 3
For the 2014-2015 National Hockey League and National Basketball Associ­
ation seasons, two hockey tickets and one basketball ticket purchased at their 
average prices cost $178.34. One hockey ticket and two basketball tickets 
cost $170.14. What were average ticket prices for the two sports? (Data from 
Team Marketing Report.)
Step 1 
Read the problem again. There are two unknowns.
Step 2 
Assign variables.
Let h = the average price for a hockey ticket
and b = the average price for a basketball ticket.
W rite a system of equations. We write one equation using the fact 
that two hockey tickets and one basketball ticket cost $178.34.
2h + b = 178.34
By similar reasoning, we can write a second equation.
h + 2b = 170.14
These two equations form a system of equations.
2h + b = 178.34 
(1)
h + 2b = 170.14 
(2)
Solve the system. Either the substitution or the elimination method 
can be used, based on personal preference. We choose the elimina­
tion method. To eliminate h, multiply equation (2) by —2 and add.
2h+ b =  
178.34 
(1)
Step 4
Step 5
- 2 h - 4 b = -340.28 
—3b = —161.94
b = 53.98
Multiply each side of (2) by —2. 
Add.
Divide by —3.
To find the value of h, let b = 53.98 in equation (2)
h + 2b = 110.14 
(2)
h + 2 (53.98) = 170.14 
Let b = 53.98. 
h + 107.96 = 170.14 
Multiply.
h = 62.18
Subtract 107.96,
State the answer. The average price for one basketball ticket was 
$53.98. For one hockey ticket, the average price was $62.18.
Step 6 
Check that these values satisfy the problem conditions.
2 ($62.18) + $53.98 = $178.34, 
as required. 
$62.18 + 2 ($53.98) = $170.14, 
as required.

EXAMPLE 5
Solving a Motion Problem
While kayaking on the Blackledge River, Rebecca traveled 9 mi upstream 
(against the current) in 2.25 hr. It only took her 1 hr paddling downstream 
(with the current) back to the spot where she started. Find her kayaking rate 
in still water and the rate of the current.
Step 1 
Read the problem. We must find two rates—Rebecca’s kayaking
rate in still water and the rate of the current.
Step 2 
Assign variables.
Let x = Rebecca’s kayaking rate in still water
and y = the rate of the current.
When the kayak is traveling against the current, the current slows it 
down. The rate of the kayak is the difference between its rate in still 
water and the rate of the current, which is (x — y) mph.
When the kayak is traveling with the current, the current speeds 
it up. The rate of the kayak is the sum of its rate in still water and 
the rate of the current, which is (x + y) mph.
Thus, 
x — y = the rate of the kayak against the current,
and 
x + y = the rate of the kayak with the current.
Make a table. Use the formula d = rt, or rt = d.

three equations.
EXAMPLE

Solving a Geometry Problem
The sum of the measures of the angles of a triangle is 180°. The smallest 
angle measures 36° less than the middle-sized angle. The largest angle mea­
sures 16° more than twice the smallest angle. Find the measure of each angle.
Step 1 
Read the problem again. There are three angles, so there will be
three unknowns.
Step 2 
Assign variables. Make a sketch, as in Figure 9.
Let 
x = the measure of the smallest angle,
y = the measure of the middle-sized angle,
and 
z = the measure of the largest angle.
Write a system of three equations. The sum of the measures of the 
angles of a triangle is 180°.
x + y + z — 180 
We can write two more equations from the information given.
Step 3
Step 4
Smallest angle

=
Largest angle

36° less than middle-sized angle.
\
y — 36
16° more than twice smallest angle.
16 + 2x
These three equations form a system.
x + y + z — 180
x = y — 36
(1)
(2)
z = 16 + 2x 
(3)
Solve the system of equations. If we write equation (2) in terms of y, 
then equations (2) and (3) will give both y and z in terms of x.
x = y — 36 
(2)
y = x + 36 
Add 36. Interchange sides.
Now substitute x + 36 for y and 16 + 2x (from equation (3)) for z in 
equation (1).
x + y + z = 180 
(1)
x + (x + 36) + (16 + 2x) = 180 
Lety = x + 36 and z = 16 + 2x.
4x + 52 = 180 
Combine like terms.
4x = 128 
Subtract 52.
x = 32
Divide by 4.
Substitute 32 for x in y = x + 36 (equation (2) solved fory) to findy.
y = 32 + 36 
Let x = 32.
y = 68
Add.

Section 4.3 
Applications of Systems of Linear Equations 279
Step 5 
Step 6
Substitute 32 for x in z = 16 + 2x (equation (3)) to find z.
Z — 16 + 2 (32) 
Let x = 32.
Z = 80 
Multiply, and then add.
State the answer. The three angles measure 32°, 68°, and 80°. 
Check. The sum of the measures of the three angles is
32° + 68° + 80° = 180°, 
as required.
Also, each of the following is a true statement.
32° = 68° — 36° 
Smallest measures 36° less than middle-sized.
80° = 16° + 2 (32°) 
Largest measures 16° more than twice smallest.
--------------------------------------------- Work Problem Q  at the Side. ►
Problem-Solving Hint
In Step 4 of Example 6, we could also have substituted 16 +  2x (from 
equation (3)) forz in equation (1) as follows.
x + y  + z  = 180 
(1)
x + y  +  (16 +  2x) =  180 
L etz = 16 + Zx.
3x  +  y  =  164 
Combine like term s. Subtract 16. 
(4)
This gives a system of two equations in xandy.
x — y = ~ 36 
(2) in standard form
3x +  y =  164 
(4)
Eliminating y gives x = 32, which can be used to obtain y =  68 and 
z =  80. There is often more than one way to solve applications involving 
systems of three equations.
EXAMPLE 7
Solving a Problem Involving Prices
At Panera Bread, a loaf of honey wheat bread costs $3.89, a loaf of tomato 
basil bread costs $5.39, and a loaf of French bread costs $3.19. On a recent 
day, three times as many loaves of honey wheat were sold as tomato basil. 
The number of loaves of French sold was 5 less than the number of loaves 
of honey wheat sold. Total receipts for these breads were $90.57. How many 
loaves of each type of bread were sold? (Data from Panera Bread.)
Step 1 
Read the problem again. There are three unknowns.
Step 2 
Assign variables to represent the three unknowns.
Let x = the number of loaves of honey wheat bread, 
y = the number of loaves of tomato basil bread, 
and z — the number of loaves of French bread.
Step 3 
Write a system of three equations. Three times as many loaves of
honey wheat were sold as of tomato basil.
x = 3y

so one way to begin is to eliminate z again, using equations (2) and (3).
319x

Multiply (2) by 319.
389x + 539y + 319z —

Use resulting equation (4) in x and y, together with equation (1), 
x — 3y = 0, to eliminate x.

Multiply (1) by -708.
708x + 539y -  10,652 (4)

y = 4 
Divide by 2663.
We can find x by substituting this value for y in equation (1).
x — 3y = 0 
x — 3 (4) = 0 
Let y = 4.
x = 12 
Multiply. Add 12.
We can find z by substituting this value for x in equation (2).
x -  z = 5

Let x = 12.
Z =  7 
Subtract 12. Multiply by —1.
State the answer. There were 12 loaves of honey wheat bread, 
4 loaves of tomato basil bread, and 7 loaves of French bread sold.
Check. Each of the following is a true statement.
12 = 3 *4 
Honey wheat is three times tomato basil.
7 = 12 — 5 
French is 5 less than honey wheat.
Multiply cost per loaf by number of loaves and add to confirm total 
receipts.

Q
 Systems of Linear Equations in Two Variables
Solving a Linear System by Substitution
Step 1 
Solve one of the equations for either variable.
Step 2 
Substitute for that variable in the other equation.
The result should be an equation with just one 
variable.
Step 3 
Solve the equation from Step 2.
Step 4 Find the value of the other variable by substituting
the result from Step 3 into the equation from Step 1.
Step 5 Check the values in both of the original equations. Then
write the solution set as a set containing an ordered pair.
Solving a Linear System by Elimination
Step 1 
Write both equations in standard form.
Step 2 Transform the equations as needed so that the
coefficients of one pair of variable terms are opposites.
Step 3 Add the new equations. The sum should be an
equation with just one variable.
Step 4 Solve the equation from Step 3.
Step 5 Find the value of the other variable by substituting
the result from Step 4 into either of the original 
equations.
Step 6 Check the values in both of the original equations. Then
write the solution set as a set containing an ordered pair.
Examples
Solve by substitution.
4 x -  y = 7 
(1)
3* + 2y = 30 
(2)
Solve for y in equation (1).
y = 4x -  1
Substitute 4* — 1 for y in equation (2), and solve for x.
3x + 2y = 30 
(2)
3x + 2(4* — 7) = 30 
Lety = 4x — 7.
3* + 8* — 14 = 30 
Distributive property 
1 lx — 14 = 30 
Combine like terms. 
11* = 44 
Add 14.
* = 4
Divide by 11.
Substitute 4 for * in the equation y = 4x — 1 to find y.
y = 4 (4) — 7 
Let x = 4. 
y = 9 
Multiply. Subtract.
Check to verify that {(4, 9)} is the solution set.
Solve by elimination.
5* + y = 2 
(1)
2* -  3y = 11 
(2)
To eliminate y, multiply equation (1) by 3, and add the result 
to equation (2).
15* + 3y = 6 3 times equation (1)
2* -  3y = 11 (2)
17* 
=17 Add.
* = 1 
Divide by 17.
Let * = 1 in equation (1), and solve for y.
5(1) + y = 2 
(1)
y = — 3 
Multiply. Subtract 5.
Check to verify that {(1,-3)} is the solution set.
Special Systems
If the result of the addition step (Step 3) is a false statement, 
such as 0 = 4, the graphs are parallel fines and there is no 
solution. The solution set is 0.
If the result is a true statement, such as 0 = 0, the graphs are 
the same fine, and an infinite number of ordered pairs are 
solutions. The solution set is written in set-builder notation as
{(*» y) I---------- }>
x — 2y — 6
—* + 2y = —2
0 = 4
x — 2y = 6
—* + 2y = —6 
0 = 0
where a form of the equation is written in the blank.
Inconsistent system 
Solution set: 0
Dependent equations 
Solution set: {(*, y) \x — 2y = 6}

equation and the remaining equation of the system.
Step 4 Solve the system of two equations in two variables
formed by the equations from Steps 2 and 3.
Step 5 Find the value of the remaining variable.
Step 6 Check the values in each of the original equations
of the system. Then write the solution set as a set 
containing an ordered triple.
Solve the system.
x + 2y — z = 6 
(1)
x + y + z = 6 
(2)
2x+ y -  z = l

Multiply (4) by —3.
6x + 4y = 26 
—5y = —10
y = 2
Multiply (5) by 2. 
Add.
Divide by —5.
To find x, substitute 2 for y in equation (4).
2x + 3 (2) = 12 
Let y = 2 in (4) 
2x 4- 6 = 12 
Multiply.
2x = 6
x = 3
Subtract 6. 
Divide by 2.
Substitute 3 for x and 2 for y in working equation (2).
x + y + z = 6 
(2)
3 + 2 + z = 6 
Substitute.
z = 1 
Subtract 5.
Check to verify that {(3, 2 ,1)} is the solution set.
Applications of Systems of Linear Equations
Use the six-step problem-solving method.
Step 1 
Read the problem carefully.
Step 2 
Assign variables.
Step 3 
Write a system of equations using all the variables. 
Step 4 Solve the system.
Step 5 
State the answer.
Step 6 Check.
The perimeter of a rectangle is 18 ft. The length is 3 ft more 
than twice the width. What are the dimensions of the rectangle?
Let x = the length and y = the width.
Write a system of equations.
2x + 2y = 18
From the perimeter formula
x = 2y + 3 
Length is 3 ft more than twice the width. 
Solve the system to find that
x — 1 and y = 2.
The length is 7 ft, and the width is 2 ft.
2(7) +2(2) = 18 and 2(2) + 3 = 7, as required.

is defined as 
2 • 2 • 2 • 2 • 2, 
which equals 
32.
The number 5, the exponent (or power), indicates that the base 2 appears as 
a factor 5 times. The quantity 25 is an exponential expression. We read 25 as 
“
2  to the fifth power” or “
2  to the fifth.”
O  Use the product rule for exponents. Consider the product 
25 • 23, which can be simplified as follows.
OBJECTIVE
5 + 3 = 8
25 • 23 =  (2 • 2 • 2 • 2 • 2 )  (2 • 2 • 2 )  =  28

Scientific Notation
A number is written in scientific notation when it is expressed in the form
a x 10°, where 1 ^  | a | <  10, and n is an integer.
OBJECTIVES
o Write numbers in scientific notation.
©  Convert numbers in srientific 
notation to standard form.
©  Use srientific notation in 
calculations.
V____________ _________________
It is customary to use X rather 
than • for multiplication.
Examples:
4 0 0 ,0 0 0 ,0 0 0 ,0 0 0 ,0 0 0  =  4  X  1 0 14
8 5 0 0  — 8 .5  X  1 0 3

In scientific notation, a number is written with the decimal point 
after the first nonzero digit, then multiplied by a power of 10.
Converting a Positive Number to Scientific Notation
Step 1 
Position the decimal point. Place a caretA to the right of the
first nonzero digit, where the decimal point will be placed.
Step 2 
Determine the numeral for the exponent. Count the number of
digits from the decimal point to the caret. This number gives the 
absolute value of the exponent on 10.
Step 3 
Determine the sign forthe exponent. Decide whether multiplying
by 10" should make the result of Step 1 greater or less.
• The exponent should be positive to make the result greater.
• The exponent should be negative to make the result Less.

Multiplying a number by a positive power of 10 makes the number greater, 
so move the decimal point to the right n places if n is positive in 10".
Multiplying by a negative power of 10 makes a number less, so move the 
decimal point to the left | n | places if n is negative.

The intensity of an earthquake is measured relative to the intensity of 
a standard zero-level earthquake of intensity 70. The relationship is 
equivalent to I  = IQX 10R, where R is the R ich ter scale measure. For 
example, if an earthquake has magnitude 5.0 on the Richter scale, then 
its intensity is calculated as
I = 70 X 105 0 = 70 X 100,000
which is 1 0 0 ,0 0 0  times as intense as a zero-level earthquake.
To compare an earthquake that measures 8.1 on the Richter scale 
to one that measures 5.2,find the ratio of the intensities.

Therefore, an earthquake that measures 8.1 on the Richter scale is almost 8 0 0  times as 
intense as one that measures 5.2.

If f(x) and g(x) define functions, then
( / + g) t o  = / t o  + g(x)
and 
( / -  g) (x ) = / ( x )  -  g (x ).
Let /( x) = x2 and g(x) = 2x + 1.

Multiplying Polynomials
To multiply two polynomials, multiply each term of one by 
each term of the other.
Multiply.
(*3 + 3x) (4x2 — 5* + 2)
= x3(4x2 — 5a; + 2) + 3x (4x2 — 5x + 2)
= 4x5 — 5X4 + 2x3 + 12jc3 — I5x2 + 6x
= 4x5 -  5x4 + 14x3 -  15r2 + 6x
To multiply two binomials, use the FOIL method. Multiply 
the First terms, the Outer terms, the Inner terms, and the 
Last terms. Then add these products.
Special Products
(x + y) (x — y) = x2 — y2 
(jc + y)2 = x2 + 2 xy + y2

Dividing by a Polynomial
Use the “long division” process. The process ends when the 
remainder is 0 or when the degree of the remainder is less 
than the degree of the divisor.

Q  Factor out the greatest 
common factor.
Q  Factor by grouping.
J
Writing a polynomial as the product of two or more simpler polynomials is 
called factoring the polynomial. For example, consider the following.
3x (5x — 2) = 15x2 — 6x 
Multiplying
15x2 — 6x = 3x (5x — 2) 
Factoring
Notice that both multiplying and factoring use the distributive property, but 
in opposite directions. Factoring “undoes” or reverses, multiplying.
o Factor out the greatest 
common factor.
®  (a) Ik + 28
The GCF is ____because it
is the greatest factor that 
divides into both____and 28.
Ik + 28
= 7 (___ ) + ____ (____ )
OBJECTIVE
■
o Factor out the greatest common factor. The first step in
factoring a polynomial is to find the greatest common factor. The product of 
the greatest common numerical factor and each variable factor of least degree 
common to every term in a polynomial is the greatest common factor (GCF) 
of the terms of the polynomial.
For example, the greatest common factor for 8* + 12 is 4 because 4 is 
the greatest factor that divides into both Sx and 12.
Sx + 12
=  4 (2 x) + 4(3) 
Factor 4 from each term.
=  4 (2x + 3) 
Distributive property, ab + ac = a (b + c)
CHECK Multiply 
4 (2 * + 3) 
to obtain 
Sx + 12. /  Original polynomial
Using the distributive property in this way is called factoring out the 
greatest common factor.

Since multiplying and factoring are operations that “undo” each other, 
factoring trinomials involves using the FOIL method in reverse. As shown 
here, the x2-term comes from multiplying x and x, and —15 comes from 
multiplying 3 and —5.

Product of 3 and —5 
is

We find the term —2x in x2 — 2x — 15 by multiplying the outer terms, 
multiplying the inner terms, and adding the results.

Inner terms:

This discussion can be generalized.
Factoring x2 + bx + c (Coeffirient of Second-Degree Term = 1)
Step 1 
Find pairs of integers whose product is c. Write all pairs whose
product is c, the third term of the trinomial.
Step 2 
Find the sum of each pair. Choose the pair whose sum is br the
coefficient of the middle term.
Step 3 
Factor the trinomial as the product of two binomials. Use the
pair of integers identified in Step 2.
If there is no pair of integers in Step 2 whose sum is b, then the polynomial 
cannot be factored. A polynomial that cannot be factored with integer 
coefficients is a prime polynomial.

EXAMPLE 6
Factoring Trinomials in ax2 + bx + cForm
Factor each trinomial.
(a) 3x2 + l x  + 2
The goal is to find the correct numbers to fill in the blanks
(
x +
.)(
X +
)
All the signs in the trinomial indicate addition, so we use addition signs. The 
first two expressions have a product of 3jc2, so they must be 3x and x.
(3jc +
m*  +
)
The product of the two last terms must be 2, which means the numbers must 
be 2 and 1. There is a choice. The 2 could be placed with the 3x or with the x. 
Only one of these choices will give the correct middle term, lx.
3x
(3x + 2) (x + 1)
2x
3x + 2x = 5x 
Wrong middle term
6x
(3x + 1) (x + 2)
x
Use the FOIL 
method to check 
each factored 
form.
6x + x = lx 
Correct middle term
Therefore, 3jc2 + l x  + 2 factors as (3jc+1)(jc + 2). (Compare to the 
answer obtained using factoring by grouping on the preceding page.)
(b) 12r2 -  5r -  2
To reduce the number o f trials, we note that the terms o f the trinomial 
have greatest common factor 1. This means that neither o f its factors can 
have a common factor except 1. We try 4 and 3 for the two first terms.
(4 r
.)(3r
)
The factors of —2 are —2 and 1, or 2 and — 1. We try both possibilities
(4r -  2) (3r + 1)
Wrong: The terms of 
4r — 2 have a common 
factor of 2. This 
cannot be correct 
because 2 is not a factor 
of 12r2 -  5r -  2.
8r
(4r — l ) ( 3 r + 2 )
—3r
8r — 3r = 5r 
Wrong middle term
The middle term on the right is 5r, instead of the —5r that is needed. We 
obtain — 5r by interchanging the signs of the second terms in the factors.
—8r
( 4 r +  l ) ( 3 r - 2 )
3 r
-8 r + 3r = -5 r 
Correct middle term
Thus, 12r2 — 5r — 2 factors as (4r + 1 ) (3r — 2). (Compare to Example 5.)

Section 6.2 
Factoring Trinomials 371
Note
As shown in Example 6(b), if the terms of a polynomial have greatest 
common factor 1, then none of the terms of its factors can have a common 
factor (except 1). This will eliminate some potential factors.
Factoring ax2 + bx + c (GCFof a,b,c = 1)
Step 1 
Find pairs of integers whose product is a. Write all pairs of
integer factors of a, the coefficient of the second-degree term.
Step 2 
Find pairs of integers whose product is c. Write all pairs of
integer factors of c, the last term.
Step 3 
Choose inner and outer terms. Use the FOIL method and try
various combinations of the factors from Steps 1 and 2 until the 
correct middle term is found.
If no such combinations exist, the trinomial is prime.
EXAMPLE 7
Factoring a Multivariable Trinomial
Factor 18m2 — 19mx — I2x2. 
(The terms have GCF 1.)
Follow the above steps to factor the trinomial. There are many possible 
factors of both 18 and —12. Try 6 and 3 for 18 and —3 and 4 for —12.
(6m — 3x) (3m + 4x)
Wrong: common factor
(6m + 4x) (3m — 3x)
Wrong: common factors
Because 6 and 3 do not work as factors of 18, try 9 and 2 instead, with 3 and 
—4 as factors o f— 12.
(9m + 3x) (2m — 4x)
Wrong: common factors
21 mx
(9m — 4x) (2m + 3x)
—8 mx
21 mx + (—8mx) = 19 mx 
Wrong middle term
The result on the right differs from the correct middle term only in sign, so 
interchange the signs of the second terms in the factors.
18m2 — 19mx — 12x2 factors as 
(9m + 4x) (2m — 3x).

Factoring Perfect Square Trinomials

x2 -  2xy + y 2 = (x -  y )2
(b) 2x2 -  4x + 4
(c) 9a2 + 12ab + 16b2
Because the trinomial x 2 + 2x y + y 2 is the square of x + y, it is a 
perfect square trinomial. Both the first and the last terms of the trinomial 
must be perfect squares. In the factored form (x + y )2, twice the product of 
the first and the last terms must give the middle term of the trinomial.

EXAMPLE 2
Factoring Perfect Square Trinomials
Factor each polynomial.
(a) 144p2 -  120p + 25
Here, 144p2 = (12p )2 and 25 = 52. The sign on the middle term is —. If 
144p2 — 120p + 25 is a perfect square trinomial, the factored form must be
(12P ~  5)2.
Determine twice the product of the two terms to see if this is correct.
2(12p) ( “ 5) = — 120p <- Desired middle term 
This is the middle term of the given trinomial.
144p2 — 120p + 25 
factors as 
(12p — 5)2
(b) 4m2 + 20mn + 49n2
If this is a perfect square trinomial, it will equal (2m + In )2. When 
multiplied out, this squared binomial has middle term
2 (2m) (In) = 28mn, 
which does not equal 20mn.
This trinomial cannot be factored by any other method. It is prime.

6.4 A General Approach to Factoring
OBJECTIVE o Factor any polynomial. A polynomial is completely factored 
when it is written as a product of prime polynomials with integer coefficients.
Factoring a Polynomial
Step 1 
Factor out any common factor.
Step 2 How many terms are in the polynomial?
If the polynomial is a binomial, check to see whether it is a dif­
ference of squares, a difference of cubes, ora sum of cubes.
If the polynomial is a trinomial, check to see whether it is a 
perfect square trinomial. If it is not, use one of the following 
methods.
• To factor x2 + bx + c, find two integers whose product is c and 
whose sum is b, the coefficient of the middle term.
• To factor ax2 + bx + c, find two integers having product ac 
and sum b. Use these integers to rewrite the middle term, and 
factor by grouping.
Alternatively, use the FOIL method and try various combina­
tions of the factors until the correct middle term is found.
If the polynomial has more than three terms, try to factor it by 
grouping.
Step 3 If any of the factors can be factored further, do so.
Step 4 Check the factored form by multiplying.

6.5 Solving Equations Using the Zero-Factor Property
OBJECTIVES
Q  Use the zero-factor property.
Q  Solve applied problems that require 
the zero-factor property.
O  Solve a formula for a specified 
variable, where factoring is 
necessary.
We have solved linear, or first-degree, equations. Solving higher-degree 
polynomial equations uses other methods, one of which involves factoring.
OBJECTIVE o Use the zero-factor property. The zero-factor property is
a special property of the number 0.
Zero-Factor Property
If two numbers have a product of 0, then at least one of the numbers must 
be 0.
Ifab = 0, then 
a = 0 or 6 = 0 
(or both).
o Solve each equation.
(a) (3x + 5 )(x +  1) = 0
To prove the zero-factor property, we first assume that a #  0. (If a 
then the property is proved already.) If a #  0, then \ exists.
ab = 0
— • ab = — • 0 
Multiply each side by i . 
a 
a
= 0,
b = 0
Multiply.
Thus, if a #  0, then b = 0, and the property is proved.
O  CAUTION
If ab = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0. However, if ab = 6, for example, it is not 
necessarily true that a = 6 or b = 6. In fact, it is very likely that neither 
a = 6 norb = 6.
The zero-factor property applies only for a product equal to 0.

Q
 Greatest Common Factors and Factoring by 
Grouping
Factoring Out the Greatest Common Factor
Use the distributive property to write the given polynomial as 
a product of two factors, one of which is the greatest common 
factor of the terms of the polynomial.
Factor 4 x2y — 50xy2.
4x2y -  50xy2
= 2xy (2x — 25y)
The greatest common 
factor is 2xy.
Factoring by Grouping
Step 1 
Group the terms so that each group has a common
factor.
Step 2 
Factor out the common factor in each group.
Step 3 
If each group now has a common factor, factor it out.
If not, try a different grouping.
Always check the factored form by multiplying.
Factor by grouping.
5a — 5b — ax + bx

Check by multiplying.
Factoring ax2 + bx + c
Use one of the following methods.
• Identify the values of a, b, and c. Find two integers having 
product ac and sum b. Use these integers to rewrite the 
middle term, and factor by grouping.
Factor I5x2 + 14x — 8.
a = 15, b = 14, and c = —8, so ac = 15 (—8) = —120. 
We must find two integers with product —120 and sum 14.
20 (-6) = -120 and 20 + (-6) = 14 
The necessary integers are 20 and —6.
15 x2 + 14* -  8
= 15 x2 + 20* -  6x -  8 
= (15;e2 + 20jc) + (—6x — 8) 
= 5* (3* + 4) — 2 (3x + 4) 
= (3* + 4) (5x -  2)

The graph of f(x) =

exist when x = 5. (It does not intersect 
the dashed vertical line whose equation 
is x = 5. This line is an asymptote.)
R ational Function
A rational function is defined by a quotient of polynomials and has the form
/(* ) =
p w
Q M
where Q (x) ^  0.
The domain of a rational function includes all real numbers except those 
that make Q(x)—that is, the denominator—equal to 0.
For example, the domain of the rational function
/(*) =
2
x — 5
Cannot equal 0
includes all real numbers except 5 because 5 would make the denominator 
equal to 0. See Figure 1.
EXAMPLE 1
Finding Domains of Rational Functions
Give the domain of each rational function.
(a) f{x) =
3
lx  -  14
Values that make the denominator 0 cannot be 
used. Set the denominator equal to 0 and solve.
lx  -  14 = 0
lx  = 14 
Add 14.
x = 2
Divide by 7.
The number 2 cannot be used as a replacement for x. Therefore, the domain 
of f  includes all real numbers except 2 and can be written using set-builder 
notation or interval notation.

Only common factors may be divided out.
Examples:

The 2 in y -  2 is not a 
factor of the numerator.
The expression 
indicates that the entire numerator is being divided 
by 2, notjust certain terms. It is already in lowestterms, although it could 
be written in the equivalent form \  -  §, or f  — 1.
We must factor before writing a fraction in lowestterms.

(a — 3) (a + 2)
a2 + 5a + 6 ’ 
(a + 3) (a + 2)
Here, a can be any value except —3 or —2, because these values make the

denominator 0. In the simplified expression ^ - 3 , a cannot equal — 3. Thus,

Section 7.2 
Adding and Subtracting Rational Expressions 419
OBJECTIVE
Find a least common denominator. We add or subtract
rational expressions with different denominators by first writing them with a 
common denominator, usually the least common denominator (LCD).
Finding the Least Common Denominator 
Step 1 
Factor each denominator.
Step 2 Find the least common denominator. The LCD is the product
of all different factors from each denominator, with each factor 
raised to the greatest power that occurs in any denominator.
7 
5
Example: 
To find the LCD for 
and ^ , we factor each denominator.
15 = 3 • 5 
and 
12 = 2 • 2 • 3 = 22 • 3
LCD = 22 • 3 • 5 = 60
Find the product of the factors, 
each raised to its greatest power.
EXAMPLE 2
Finding Least Common Denominators
Suppose that the given expressions are denominators of fractions. Find the 
LCD for each group of denominators.
(a) 5xy2, 2x3y
5xy2 = 5 • x • y 2
2x3y = 2 • x 3 • y
3
Each denominator is already factored. 
Greatest exponent on x is 3.
LCD = 5 • 2 • x 3 • y2 
Greatest exponent on y is 2
= 10jc3y2
(b) k — 3, k
The LCD must be divisible by both k — 3 and k. It is 
usually best to leave an LCD in factored form.
LCD = k ( k -  3)
Don't forget 
the factor k.
(c) y2 -  2y -  8, yl + 3y + 2
y2 — 2y — 8 = (_y — 4) (_y + 2)
y2 + 3y + 2 = (y + 2) (y + 1)
Factor.
LCD = (y — 4) (y + 2) (y + 1)
(d) 8z -  24, 5z2 -  15z
8z -  24 = 8 (z -  3)
5z2 -  15z = 5z(z -  3)
Factor.
LCD = 8 • 5z • (z — 3), 
or 4 0 z(z~ 3 )
(e) m2 + 5m + 6, 
m2 + 4m + 4, 
2m + 6
m2 + 5m + 6 = (m + 3) (m + 2) 
m2 + 4m + 4 = (m + 2)2 
2m + 6 = 2 (m + 3)
LCD = 2 (m + 3) (m + 2)
Factor. Notice that 
(m + 2) is squared 
in the second 
denominator.

OBJECTIVE o Determine the domain of the variable in a rational
equation. The domain of the variable in a rational equation is the inter­
section (overlap) of the domains of the rational expressions in the equation. 
When we solve rational equations, knowing the domain of the variable 
allows us to determine whether a proposed solution—that is, a value of the 
variable that appears to be solution—must be discarded.

{x | x is a real number}, 
and 
{jc | jc is a real number, x #  0}.

(We could use 
interval notation.)

{x \x is a real number, x #  — 3},
and 
{jc | jc is a real number, x #  ± 3 }
±  is read "positive 
or negative," or 
"plus or minus."
The domain of the variable is the intersection of the three domains, all real 
numbers except 3 and —3, written {x \x is a real number, x #  ±3}.

OBJECTIVE
e  Solve rational equations. To solve rational equations, we 
usually multiply all terms in the equation by the least common denominator 
to clear the fractions. We can do this only with equations, not expressions.
Solving an Equation with Rational Expressions
Step 1 
Determine the domain of the variable.
Step 2 
Multiply each side of the equation by the LCD to dear the
fractions.
Step 3 Solve the resulting equation.
Step 4 
Check that each proposed solution is in the domain, and discard
any values that are not. Check the remaining proposed solu­
tio n ^) in the original equation.

OBJECTIVE
Q  Recognize the graph of a rational function. Recall that a
function defined by a quotient of polynomials is a rational function. 
Because one or more values of the variable may be excluded from the 
domain of a rational function, its graph is often discontinuous—that is, there 
will be one or more breaks in the graph.

One simple rational function is the reciprocal function /(x ) = K The 
domain of this function includes all real numbers except 0. Thus, this func­
tion pairs every real number except 0 with its reciprocal.
The closer negative values of x are to 0, 
the less (“more negative”) y is.
The closer positive values of
x are to 0, the greater y is.

Plotting the points from the table, we obtain the graph in Figure 2.
Reciprocal function
f ( x ) = -x
Domain: {x \ x is a real number, x 
0}
Range: {y \ y is a real number, y 
0}
Because the domain of f ( x ) = \  includes all real numbers except 0, 
there is no point on the graph where x = 0. The vertical line with equation 
x = 0 is a vertical asymptote. The horizontal line with equation y = 0 is a 
horizontal asymptote. The graph approaches these asymptotes but does not 
cross them.

There is no point on the graph, shown in 
Figure 3, for x = 3 because 3 is excluded 
from the domain. The dashed line
x = 3 is a vertical asymptote.
It is not part of the graph. The graph gets 
closer to the vertical asymptote as the 
x-values get closer to 3. Again,
y = 0 is a horizontal asymptote.

EXAMPLE 6
Solving a Distance, Rate, Time Problem
A paddle wheeler travels 10 mi against the current in a river in the same time 
that it travels 15 mi with the current. If the rate of the current is 3 mph, find 
the rate of the boat in still water.
Step 1 
Read the problem. We must find the rate of the boat in still water.
Step 2 
Assign a variable.
Let x = the rate of the boat in still water.
Traveling against the current slows the boat down, so the rate of the 
boat is the difference between its rate in still water and the rate of 
the current—that is, (jc — 3) mph.
Traveling with the current speeds the boat up, so the rate of the 
boat is the sum of its rate in still water and the rate of the current— 
that is, (x + 3) mph.
Thus, 
x — 3 = the rate of the boat against the current,
and 
x + 3 = the rate of the boat with the current.
Because the time is the same going against the current as with 
the current, find time in terms of distance and rate for each sit­
uation. Against the current, the distance is 10 mi and the rate is 
(jc — 3) mph.

OBJECTIVE
Solve applications about work rates.
Problem-Solving Hint
If the letters r, t, and A represent the rate at which work is done, the time 
required, and the amount of work accomplished, respectively, then
A = rt.
Notice the similarity to the distance formula, d = rt.
Amount of work can be measured in terms of jobs accomplished. If 1 job 
is completed, then A = 1, and the formula gives the rate r as
1
1 = rt, 
or 
r = —.

Nurses use proportions to determine the amount of a drug to administer when the dose 
of the drug is measured in milligrams but the drug is packaged in a diluted form in 
milliliters. (Data from Hoyles, Celia, Richard Noss, and Stefano Pozzi, “Proportional 
Reasoning in Nursing Practice,” Journal for Research in Mathematics Education.)
For example, to find the number of milliliters of fluid needed to administer 
300 mg of a drug that comes packaged as 120 mg in 2 mL of fluid, a nurse sets up the 
proportion
120 mg 
300 mg 
2 mL 
x mL
where x represents the amount to administer in milliliters. Use this method to find the 
correct dose for each prescription.

7.6 Variation
OBJECTIVE !o Write an equation expressing direct
variation. The circumference of a circle is given by the 
formula C = 2irr, where r is the radius of the circle. See 
Figure 5. The circumference is always a constant multiple 
of the radius—that is, C is always found by multiplying r by 
the constant 2tt.
As the radius increases, the circumference increases. 
As the radius decreases, the circumference decreases.
C = 2nr
Figure 5
As a result, the circumference is said to vary directly as the radius.
Direct Variation
y varies directly as x if there exists a real number k such that
y  = kx.
Stated another way, y is proportional to x. The number k is the constant 
of variation.
In direct variation, for k > to, as the value o f x increases, the value o f y 
also increases. Similarly, as x decreases, y decreases.
OBJECTIVE
G  Find the constant of variation, and solve direct variation
problems. The direct variation equation y = kx defines a linear function, 
where the constant o f variation k is the slope o f the line. For example, the 
following equation describes the cost y to buy x gallons of gasoline.
y = 3.50x
The cost varies directly as the number of gallons of gasoline purchased. 
As the number of gallons of gasoline increases, the cost increases. 
As the number of gallons of gasoline decreases, the cost decreases. 
The constant of variation k is 3.50, the cost of 1 gallon of gasoline.

Eva is paid an hourly wage. One week she worked 43 hr and was paid 
$795.50. How much does she earn per hour?
Let 
h = the number of hours she works

P = her corresponding pay.
k represents Eva's

P varies directly as h.
Let P = 795.50 and h = 43. 
Divide by 43.
Her hourly wage is $ 18.50, and P and h are related by P = 18.50k.

The interest on a loan or an investment is given by the formula I = prt. Here, 
for a given principal p, the interest earned I varies jointly as the interest rate 
r and the time t that the principal is left earning interest. If an investment 
earns $100 interest at 5% for 2 yr, how much interest will the same principal 
earn at 4.5% for 3 yr?
We use the formula I = prt, where p is the constant of variation because 
it is the same for both investments.
I = prt
100 = p (0.05) (2) 
Let / = 100, r = 0.05, and t = 2.

p = 1000 
Divide by 0.1. Rewrite.
Now we find I when p = 1000, r = 0.045, and t = 3.

OBJECTIVE ► 0
 Find roots of numbers. Recall that 62 = 36. We say that 
“6 squared equals 36.” The opposite (or inverse) of squaring a number is 
taking its square root.
It is customary to 
write V , rather
than 
.
V 36 = 6, 
because 
62 = 36.
We extend this idea to cube roots V~~, fourth roots XV, and higher roots.
Meaning of Vo
The nth root of a, written V o , is a number whose nth power equals a.
V o  =  b 
means 
bn =  o.
The number a is the radicand, n is the 
index, or order, and the expression 
V o  is a radical.

OBJECTIVE
e
 Find principal roots. If n is even, positive numbers have two 
nth roots. For example, both 4 and —4 are square roots of 16, and 2 and —2
are fourth roots of 16. For a > 0, V o  represents the positive root, or the
principal root, and — V o  represents the negative root. For all n, V 5  = 0.
nth Root
Case 1 
If n is even and a is positive or 0, then
V o  represents the principal nth root of a, and
-  V o  represents the negative nth root of a (here a ±  0). 
Case 2 
If n is even an d a is negative, th en
V o  is not a real number.
Case 3 
If n \sodd, then
there is exactly one nth root of a, written V o .
www.ebook3000.com

Section 8.1 
Radical Expressions and Graphs 481
If n is even (Case 1), then the two nth roots of a are often written together 
with ±  read “positive or negative” or “plus or minus.”
EXAMPLE 2
Finding Roots
Find each root.
(a) V 100 = 10 
(Case 1)
Because the radicand, 100, is positive, there are two square roots: 10 and 
— 10. We want the principal square root, which is 10.
(b) -  VlOO = -  10 
(Case 1)
Here, we want the negative square root, —10.
(c) ^ 8 l  = 3 
Principal 4th root (Case 1)
(d) — \/8 T  = — 3 
Negative 4th root (Case 1)
(e) N /-81 
(Case2)
The index is even and the radicand is negative. Any real number raised 
to an even power is positive—here 34 = 81 and (—3)4 = 81. Thus,
81 is not a real number.
(f) \K8 = 2, because 23 = 8. 
(Case 3)
(g) 
8 = —2, because (—2 )3 = —8. 
(Case 3)
In parts (f) and (g), the index is odd. Each radical represents exactly one 
nth root (regardless of whether the radicand is positive, negative, or 0).

OBJECTIVE !o Graph functions defined by radical expressions. A radical
expression is an algebraic expression that contains a radical.
Radical expressions
In earlier chapters we graphed functions defined by polynomial and rational
expressions. Now we examine the graphs of functions defined by the radical
expressions f(x ) = V x  and f(x ) = 'NKx.
Figure 1 shows the graph of the square root function
f(x) = V i,
together with a table of selected points. Only nonnegative values can be used 
for x, so the domain is [0, oo). Because V x  is the principal square root of x, 
it always has a nonnegative value, so the range is also [ 0, oo).

Figure 2 shows the graph of the cube root function
f ( x )  = i f f .
Any real number (positive, negative, or 0) can be used for x in the cube root 
function, so nKx can be positive, negative, or 0. Thus, both the domain and 
the range of the cube root function are (—00, 00).

Graph each function, and give its domain and range.
(a) f(x) = V x  -  3
A table of values is given with the graph in Figure 3. The x-values were 
chosen so that the function values are all integers. For the radicand to be 
nonnegative, we must have
x -  3 >  0 
x >  3.
Therefore, the domain is [3, oo). Function values are positive or 0, so the

Radical Expressions and Graphs 483
OBJECTIVE !o Find nth roots of nth powers. Consider the expression
v a2. At first glance, we may think that it is equivalent to a. However, this 
is not necessarily true. For example, consider the following.
If a = 6, 
then 
If a = — 6, 
then
= 
V &
=
V 36 = 6. 
V 36 = 6.
Instead of —6, we 
get 6, the absolute 
value of—6.
The symbol V o 2 represents the nonnegative square root, so we write V o 2 
with absolute value bars, as \a\, because a may be a negative number.
Meaning of Vo*
For any real number a, 
V o 2 =  | a |.
In words, the principal square root of a2 is the absolute value of a.
o Find each square root. In parts (c)

o Use a calculator to approximate 
each radical to three decimal 
places.
(a) V 17 
(b) -V 3 6 2
OBJECTIVE
O  Use a calculator to find roots. Radical expressions often 
represent irrational numbers. To find approximations of such radicals, we 
usually use a calculator. For example,
V l5  =  3.872983346, 3^10 =  2.15443469, 
and 
^ 2  =  1.189207115,
where the symbol «  means “is approximately equal to.” In this text, we 
often give approximations rounded to three decimal places. Thus,
V l5  «  3.873, 
=  2.154, 
and 
V 2  «  1.189.
There is a simple way to check that a calculator approximation is “in the 
ballpark.” For example, because 16 is slightly larger than 15, \ / l 6 = 4 should 
be slightly larger than \ / l 5 . Thus, 3.873 is a reasonable approximation
for V l5 .
(c) v  9482 
(d) V 6825
Note
Methods for finding approximations differ among makes and models of 
calculators. Consult your owner's guide for keystroke instructions. Be 
aware that graphing calculators often differ from scientific calculators in 
the order in which keystrokes are made.

8.2 Rational Exponents
OBJECTIVE o Use exponential notation for nth roots. Consider the 
expression (31/2)2. We can simplify it as follows.
(31/2)2
= 31/2 • 31/2 
a2 = a -a
— 3 1 /2 + 1 /2
= 31 
= 3
n  —  „ m + n
Product rule: am • an = a 
Add exponents.
a1 = a
Also, by definition,
(V 3 )2 -  V 3  • V 3  = 3
Because both (31/2)2 and (\/3  )2 equal 3, it seems reasonable to define
31/2 = V 3.

Q  Define and use expressions of the form am,n. We know

109. The threshold weight 7, in pounds, for a person is 
the weight above which the risk of death increases 
greatly. The threshold weight in pounds for men 
aged 40-49 is related to height in inches by the 
function
h(T) = (1860.8677)1/3.
What height corresponds to a threshold weight of 
200 lb for a 46-yr-old man? Round the answer to the 
nearest inch and then to the nearest tenth of a foot.
110. Meteorologists can determine the duration of a 
storm by using the function
7(D ) = 0.07D372,
where D is the diameter of the storm in miles and 
7 is the time in hours. Find the duration of a storm 
with a diameter of 16 mi. Round the answer to the 
nearest tenth of an hour.
The windchill factor is a measure of the cooling effect that the wind has on a 
person’s skin. It calculates the equivalent cooling temperature if there were no wind. 
The National Weather Service uses the formula
Windchill temperature = 35.74 + 0.62157 -  35.75V4725 + 0.42757Y4725,
where T is the temperature in °F and V is the wind speed in miles per hour, to 
calculate windchill. The table gives the windchill factor for various wind speeds 
and temperatures at which frostbite is a risk, and how quickly it may occur.

OBJECTIVE Q  Use the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem
gives an equation that relates the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle.
Pythagorean Theorem
If 0  and b are the lengths of the shorter sides of a right triangle and cis 
the length of the longest side, then the following holds true.
a2 + b2 = c2
Leg a
1 denotes a 90° 
or right angle
The two shorter sides are the legs of the triangle, and the longest side is 
the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle.
leg2 + leg2 = hypotenuse2
Later we will see that an equation such as x2 = 7 has two solutions: V 7 
(the principal, or positive, square root of 7) and — 'S/l. Similarly, c2 = 15 
has two solutions, ± \/l5. In applications we often choose only the positive 
square root.

(—5, 3) and the horizontal line through (3,-4) intersect at the point 
(—5, —4). Thus, the point (—5, —4) becomes the vertex of the right angle in 
a right triangle.
By the Pythagorean theorem, the sum of the squares of the lengths of the 
two legs a and b of the right triangle in Figure 6 is equal to the square of the 
length of the hypotenuse, c.

Because the x-coordinate of two of the points in Figure 6 is —5, side a 
is vertical. We can find a by finding the difference of the y-coordinates. We 
subtract —4 from 3 to obtain a positive value for a.
a = 3 -  (-4) = 7
Similarly, we find b by subtracting —5 from 3.
b = 3 -  (-5) = 8

Section 8.3 Simplifying Radical Expressions 505
Now substitute these values for a and b into the equation.
c2 = a2 + b2 
Pythagorean theorem 
c2 = 72 + 82 
Let a = 7 and b = 8.
c2 = 49 + 64 Apply the exponents.
c2 — 113
= V U 3
Add.
Choose the principal root.
We choose the principal root because distance cannot be negative. Therefore, 
the distance between (—5, 3) and (3, —4) is n/  113.
o Find the distance between each 
pair of points.
(a) (2,-1) and (5, 3)
Note
It is customary to leave the distance in radical form. Do not use a calculator 
to get an approximation unless specifically directed to do so.
This work can be generalized. Figure 7 shows the two points (jq, y\) and 
(.x2, y2). The distance a between (jq, y\) and (jc2, y\) is given by
The distance b between (jc2, y2) and (jc2, yi) is 
given by
b = \y2 - y 1
From the Pythagorean theorem, we obtain the 
following.
c2 = a2 + b2
c2 = (x2 -  Xly  + h 2 -  yi)2
For all real numbers a,

Choosing the principal square root gives the distance formula. In this 
formula, we use d (to denote distance) rather than c.
(b) (-3, 2) and (0, -4)
Distance Formula
The distance d between the points (*i,y i) and (x2,y2) is given by
d = V(x2 -  Xi)2 + (y2 -  yi)2.
EXAMPLE 9
Using the Distance Formula
Find the distance between the points (—3, 5) and (6, 4).
We arbitrarily choose to let (jci, yi) = (—3, 5) and (jc2, y2) = (6, 4)
Distance formula
d = V { x 2 - Xl)2 + (y2 -  yi)2
d = \/[ 6  — (— 3) ]2 +  (4 — 5)2 
Let x 2 =  6, y 2 =  4, X\

The following letter appeared in the column “Ask Tom Why, ” written by 
Tom Skilling of the Chicago Tribune.
Dear Tom,
I cannot remember the formula to calculate the distance to the 
horizon. I have a stunning view from my 14th floor condo, 150 feet 
above the ground. How far can I see?
Ted Fleischaker; Indianapolis, Indiana 
(Used by permission of Ted Fleischaker.)
Skilling’s answer was as follows.
To find the distance to the horizon in miles, take the square root 
of the height of your view in feet and multiply that result by 1.224.
Your answer will be the number of miles to the horizon. (Data from 
Chicago Tribune.)
Use this information to work each problem.
135. (a) Write a formula for calculating the distance d to the horizon in terms of the
height h of the view.
(b) Assuming Ted’s eyes are 6 ft above the ground, the total height from the 
ground is 150 + 6 = 156 ft. Use the formula from part (a) to find the distance, 
to the nearest tenth of a mile, that Ted can see to the horizon.

Multiplying and Dividing Radical Expressions 519
OBJECTIVE ►© Rationalize denominators with one radical term. As
defined earlier, a simplified radical expression will have no radical in the 
denominator. The origin of this agreement no doubt occurred before the days 
of high-speed calculation, when computation was a tedious process performed 
by hand.
Consider the radical expression 
To find a decimal approximation by
hand, it is necessary to divide 1 by a decimal approximation for Vl, such 
as 1.414. The division is much easier if the divisor is a whole number. This

can be accomplished by multiplying ^  by 1 in the form

in any form does not change the value o f the original expression.

Rationalizing a Denominator
The process of removing radicals from a denominator so that the

Section 8.6 Solving Equations with Radicals 529
8.6 Solving Equations with Radicals
OBJECTIVE ► Q  Solve radical equations using the power rule. An equation
that includes one or more radical expressions with a variable in a radicand is 
a radical equation.
V jc — 4 = 8, V ^ T E  = 3 V ^ T ,  
+ X = 27
Radical equations
Consider the equation x = I, which has only one solution. Its solution set
is {1}. If we square both sides of this equation, we obtain x2 = 1. This new 
equation has two solutions, — 1 and 1. Notice that the solution of the original 
equation is also a solution of the “squared” equation. However, that equation 
has another solution, — 1, that is not a solution of the original equation.
When solving radical equations, we use this idea of raising both sides to 
a power. This is an application of the power rule.
OBJECTIVES
o Solve radical equations using the
power rule.
©  Solve radical equations that 
require additional steps.
O  Solve radical equations with 
indexes greater than 2.
O  Use the power rule to solve a 
formula for a specified variable.
Power Rule for Solving a Radical Equation
If both sides of an equation are raised to the same power, all solutions of 
the original equation are also solutions of the new equation.
Q Solve each equation.
(a) V r  = 3
The power rule does not say that all solutions o f the new equation are 
solutions o f the original equation. They may or may not be. A value of the 
variable that appears to be a solution is a proposed solution. Such values 
that do not satisfy the original equation are extraneous solutions. They must 
be rejected.
O  CAUTION L
When the power rule is used to solve an equation, every solution of the 
new equation must be checked in the original equation.
EXAMPLE 1
Using the Power Rule
Solve \/3 x  + 4 = 8.
(V o )2 = Vo • Vo = 0,
for o > 0.
(\/3 x  + 4) 2 = 82 
Use the power rule and square each side. 
3x + 4 = 64 Apply the exponents.
3x = 60 Subtract 4.
x = 20 Divide by 3.
CHECK
V3x+4 = 8
Original equation
V3 • 20 + 4 — 8 
Let x = 20.
V64 — 8 
Evaluate the radicand.
8 = 8 /  True
Because 20 satisfies the original equation, the solution set is {20}.

(V 5 x + 3)2 = (____)2
Step 3 Solve.
5x +  3 = ___

Step 4 Check the proposed 
solution in the original 
equation.
The result is a {true / false) 
statement, so the solution 
set is___
(b) V x -  9 -  3 = 0
(c) V3x + 4 + 5 = 0
The method used in the solution of the equation in Example 1 can be 
generalized.
Solving a Radical Equation
Step 1 
Isolate the radical. Make sure that one radical term is alone on
one side of the equation.
Step 2 
Apply the power rule. Raise each side of the equation to a power
that is the same as the index of the radical.
Step 3 
Solve the resulting equation. If it still contains a radical, repeat
Steps 1 and 2.
Step 4 
Check all proposed solutions in the original equation. Discard
any values that are not solutions of the original equation.
O  CAUTION
Remember to check all proposed solutions (Step 4) or an incorrect 
solution set may result.

OBJECTIVE o Simplify numbers of the form V — b, where b >  0. The
equation x2 + 1 = 0 has no real number solution because any solution must 
be a number whose square is — 1. In the set of real numbers, all squares are 
nonnegative numbers because the product of two positive numbers or two 
negative numbers is positive and 02 = 0. To provide a solution for the 
equation x2 + 1 = 0, we introduce a new number i.

of a real number and i.

Imaginary Unit /
The imaginary unit/is defined as follows.

If a and b are real numbers, then any number of the form

t 
t
Real part 
Imaginary part
is a complex number. In the complex number a +  bi, the number a is the 
real part and b is the imaginary part.*
The following important concepts apply to a complex number a + bi.
1. If b = 0, then a + bi = a, which is a real number.
Thus, the set o f real numbers is a subset of the set o f complex numbers. 
See Figure 8.
2. If b ¥= 0, then a + bi is a nonreal complex number.
Examples: 
7 + 2/, 
—1 — i
3. If a = 0 and b 9^ 0, then the nonreal complex number is a pure imaginary 
number.
Examples: 
3/, 
—16/
A complex number written in the form a + bi is in standard form. 
In this section, most answers will be given in standard form, but if a = 0 or 
b = 0, we consider answers such as a or bi to be in standard form.
The relationships among the subsets of the complex numbers are shown

Solving Equations with Radicals
Solving a Radical Equation
Step 1 Isolate one radical on one side of the equation.
Step 2 Raise each side of the equation to a power that is the 
same as the index of the radical.
Step 3 Solve the resulting equation. If it still contains a 
radical, repeat Steps 1 and 2.
Step 4 Check all proposed solutions in the original equation. 
Discard any values that are not solutions of the 
original equation.

A quadratic equation (in x here) can be written in the form
ax2 + bx + c = 0,
where a, b, and c are real numbers and a #  0. The given form is called 
standard form.

◄ Work Problem Q  at the Side.
OBJECTIVE
o  Review the zero-factor property. In earlier work, we used 
factoring and the zero-factor property to solve quadratic equations.
Zero-Factor Property
If two numbers have a product of 0, then at Least one of the numbers 
must be 0. That is, if ab = 0, then a = Oorb = 0.
EXAMPLE 1
Using the Zero-Factor Property
Solve 3x2 — 5x — 28 = 0.
This trinomial can 
be factoredran >  3x2 -  5x -  28 = 0
The quadratic equation 
must be in standard form.
(3x + 7) (x — 4) = 0 
Factor.
3x + 7 = 0

EXAMPLE 3
Using the Square Root Property in an Application
Galileo Galilei developed a formula for freely falling objects,
d = 1612,
where d is the distance in feet that an object falls (disregarding air resistance) in 
t seconds, regardless of weight. The Leaning Tower of Pisa is about 180 ft tall. 
Use the formula to determine how long it would take an object dropped from 
the top of the tower to fall to the ground. (Data from www.brittanica.com)
d = 1612 
180 = 1612 
11.25 = t2
Galileo’s formula 
Let d = 180. 
Divide by 16.
t = V ll.2 5
or
t = - V ll.2 5  
Square root property
Time cannot be negative, so we discard t = - V ll.2 5 . Using a calculator, 
V ll.2 5  =  3.4 so t «  3.4. The object would fall to the ground in about 3.4 sec.

OBJECTIVE ► ©  Solve quadratic equations by completing the square. We
can use the square root property to solve any quadratic equation by writing it 
in the form
Square of a binomial ->  (x + k)2 = n. 
Constant
That is, we must write the left side of the equation as a perfect square trino­
mial that can be factored as (x + k)2, the square of a binomial, and the right 
side must be a constant. This process is called completing the square. 
Recall that the perfect square trinomial
x2 + lOx + 25 
can be factored as 
(x + 5)2.
In the trinomial, the coefficient of x (the first-degree term) is 10 and the con­
stant term is 25. If we take half of 10 and square it, we get the constant term, 25.

Completing the Square to Solve ax2 + bx + c = 0 (Where a #  0)
Step 1 
Be sure the second-degree term has coefficient 1.
• If the coefficient of the second-degree term is 1, go to Step 2.
• If it is not 1, but some other nonzero number a, divide each 
side of the equation by a.
Step 2 Write the equation in correct form. Make sure that all variable
terms are on one side of the equality symbol and the constant
term is on the other side.
Step 3 
Complete the square.
• Take half the coefficient of the first-degree term, and square it.
• Add the square to each side of the equation.
• Factor the variable side, which should be a perfect square tri­

The Greeks had a method of completing the square geometrically in which they 
literally changed a figure into a square. For example, to complete the square for
x2 + 6x,
we begin with a square of side x, as in the figure on the left. We add three rectangles of 
width 1 to the right side and the bottom to get a region with area x2 + 6x. To fill in the 
corner (complete the square), we must add nine l-by-\ squares, as shown on the right.

When solving a quadratic equation, it is a good idea to try to factor the 
quadratic expression first. If it can be factored, then apply the zero-factor

quadratic formula.

EXAMPLE 2
Using the Quadratic Formula (One Rational Solution)
Solve 9x2 + 12* + 4 = 0.
The trinomial on the left side of the equality symbol can be factored, so 
this equation could be solved using the zero-factor property. However, if 
we did not recognize this and solved using the quadratic formula, our work 
might look similar to that shown below.

OBJECTIVE
O  Use the discriminant to determine the number and type 
of solutions. The solutions of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 are 
given by
—b ± \Zb2 — 4 ac
Discriminant
The expression under the radical, b2 — 4ac, is called the discriminant 
because it distinguishes among the numbers of solutions—one or two—and 
the types of solutions—rational, irrational, or nonreal complex—of a 
quadratic equation.
(b) (* + 2 ) ( * - 6 )  = —17
Discriminant
If a, b, and care integers in a quadratic equation ax2 +  bx +  c =  0, then 
the discriminant b2 — 4ac can be used to determine the number and type 
of solutions of the equation as follows.

EXAMPLE 5
Using the Discriminant
Find the discriminant. Use it to predict the number and type of solutions 
for each equation. Then tell whether the equation can be solved using the 
zero-factor property or whether the quadratic formula should be used.
(a) 6*2 — * — 15 = 0
First identify the values of a, b, and c. Because — * = — 1*, the value of 
b is — 1. We find the discriminant by evaluating b2 — 4ac.
b2 — 4ac
= ( - i ) 2 -
Use parentheses and 
substitute carefully.
4 (6) (—15) 
a = 6, b = — l,c = —15 (all integers)
= 1+ 360
Apply the exponent. Multiply.
Add.
= 192, 
which is a perfect square.
The discriminant 361 is a perfect square, so referring to the table we see 
that there will be two rational solutions. We can solve using the zero-factor 
property.
(b) 3*2 — 4* = 5
Write the equation in standard form as 3*2 — 4* — 5 = 0
b 2  — 4ac
Discriminant
= (— 4)2 — 4 (3) (—5) 
a = 3, b = —4, c = — 5 (all integers)
= 16 + 60
Apply the exponent. Multiply.
= 76
Add.
Because 76 is positive but not the square of an integer, and a, b, and c are 
integers, this quadratic equation will have two irrational solutions and is best 
solved using the quadratic formula.
(c) 4*2 + 9 = 12*
First write the equation in standard form as 4*2 — 12* + 9 = 0.
b2 — 4 ac 
Discriminant
= (—12)2 — 4 (4) (9) 
a = 4, b = —12, c = 9 (all integers)
= 144 — 144 
Apply the exponent. Multiply.
= 0 
Subtract.
The discriminant is 0, so this quadratic equation will have only one rational 
solution. We can solve using the zero-factor property.
4*2 + * + 1 = 0
X =  lx , so
b = 1.
b2 — 4 ac
= l2 — 4 (4) (1) 
= 1 - 1 6  
= -1 5
Discriminant
a = 4, b = 1, c = 1 (all integers) 
Apply the exponent. Multiply. 
Subtract.
Because the discriminant is negative, this quadratic equation will have two 
nonreal complex solutions. The quadratic formula should be used to solve it.

E S I S i l & O  Solve equations that are quadratic in form. A nonqua 
dratic equation that can be written in the form
au2 + bu + c = 0,
for a #  0 and an algebraic expression u, is quadratic in form.
Many equations that are quadratic in form can be solved more easily 
by defining and substituting a “temporary” variable u for an expression 
involving the variable in the original equation.
o Solve each equation, 
(a) * = \ / l x  — 10

©  Define a variable u in terms 
of x, and write each equation 
in quadratic form
au2 + bu + c = 0.
(a) 2*4 + 5*2 -  12 = 0
EXAMPLE 5
Defining Substitution Variables
Define a variable u in terms of x, and write each equation in quadratic form
au2 + bu + c = 0.
(a) x 4 -  13*2 + 36 = 0
Look at the two terms involving the variable *, ignoring their coeffi­
cients. Try to find one variable expression that is the square of the other. 
Because *4 = (x 2)2, we can define u = x 2, and rewrite the original equation 
as a quadratic equation in u.
u2 — 13u + 36 = 0 
Here, u = x2.
(b) 2 (4* -  3)2 + 7 (4* -  3) + 5 -  0
Because this equation involves both (4* — 3)2 and (4* — 3), we choose 
u — 4* 
3. Substituting u for 4* — 3 gives a quadratic equation in u.
2u2 + lu  + 5 = 0 
Here, u = Ax — 3.
(c) 2jc2/3 -  1 1jc1/3 + 12 = 0
In this case, we apply a power rule for exponents, (am)n = amn. Because 
(xlh)2 = x213, we define u = x i/3. With this substitution, the original equation 
can be written as follows.
2u2 — 11m + 12 = 0 
Here, u = x113.

Solving for a Specified Variable
Solve s = 2t2 + kt for t.
Because the equation has terms with t2 and t, we write it in standard 
form ax2 + bx + c = 0, with t as the variable instead of x
s = 2t2 + kt 
0 = 2t2 + kt -
2t2 + kt — s = 0
Subtract s. 
Standard form
To solve 2t2 + kt — s = 0 for t, we use the quadratic formula.

The Pythagorean theorem is represented by the equation
a2 + b2 = c2. 
See Figure 2.
EXAMPLE 3
Using the Pythagorean Theorem
Two cars left an intersection at the same time, one heading due north, the other 
due west. Some time later, they were exactly 100 mi apart. The car headed 
north had gone 20 mi farther than the car headed west. How far had each car 
traveled?
Step 1 
Read the problem carefully. 
Step 2 
Assign a variable.
North
Let
x = the distance traveled by 
the car headed west.
/
West
Then x + 20 = the distance traveled by
the car headed north.
See Figure 3. The cars are 100 mi apart, 
so the hypotenuse of the right triangle 
equals 100.

for 296 sq yd of sod. How 
wide will the strip be?
OBJECTIVE
Solve applied problems using area formulas.
EXAMPLE 4
Solving an Area Problem
A rectangular reflecting pool in a park is 20 ft wide and 30 ft long. The park 
gardener wants to plant a strip of grass of uniform width around the edge of 
the pool. She has enough seed to cover 336 ft2. How wide will the strip be?
Step 1 
Read the problem carefully.
Step 2 
Assign a variable. The pool is shown in Figure 4.
Let 
* = the unknown width of the grass strip.
Then 20 + 2x = the width of the large rectangle (which is the width
of the pool plus two grass strips),
and 
30 + 2x = the length of the large rectangle.
Step 3 
W rite an equation. Refer to Figure 4.
(30 + 2x) (20 + 2x) 
Area of large rectangle (length • width)
30 • 20, 
or 
600 
Area of pool (in square feet)
The area of the large rectangle minus the area of the pool should 
equal 336 ft2, the area of the grass strip.

Factor.
* + 28 = 0 
or 
* — 3 = 0
Zero-factor property
* = — 28 
or 
* = 3
Solve each equation.
Step 5 
State the answer. The width cannot be —28 ft, so the grass strip
will be 3 ft wide.
Step 6 
Check. If x = 3, we can find the area of the large rectangle (which
includes the grass strip).
(30 + 2*3)  (20 + 2 • 3) = 36 • 26 = 936 ft2 
Area of pool and strip
The area of the pool is
30 • 20 = 600 ft2.
So, the area of the grass strip is
936 — 600 = 336 ft2, 
as required.

OBJECTIVE o Solve applied problems using quadratic functions as
models. Some applied problems can be modeled by quadratic functions, 
which for real numbers a, b, and c can be written in the form
f ( x )  = ax2 + bx + c 
(where a ^  0).
EXAMPLE 5
Solving an Applied Problem Using a Quadratic Function
If an object is projected upward from the top of a 144-ft building at 112 ft 
per sec, its position (in feet above the ground) is given by
s(t) = - \ 6 t 2 + 112t + 144,
where t is time in seconds after it was projected. When does it hit the ground?
When the object hits the ground, its distance above the ground is 0. We 
must find the value of t that makes s(t) = 0.
s(t) = - 1 6 t 2 + 112f + 144 
0 = —1612 + l i l t  + 144

EXAMPLE 6
Using a Quadratic Function to Model the CPI
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is used to measure trends in prices for a 
“basket” of goods purchased by typical American families. This index uses 
a base period of 1982-1984, which means that the index number for that 
period is 100. The quadratic function
f(x) = —0.002.x2 + 4.58* + 83.7
approximates the CPI for the years 1980-2014, where * is the number of 
years since 1980. (Data from Bureau of Labor Statistics.)
(a) Use the model to approximate the CPI for 2014.
For 2014, * = 2014 -  1980 = 34, so find /(34) 
f(x) = -0.002*2 + 4.58* + 83.7
Given model
/ (34) = -0.002 (34)2 + 4.58 (34) + 83.7 
Let * = 34. 
/(34) = 237
Nearest whole number
According to the model, the CPI for 2014 was 237.

Total spending (in billions of dollars) in the United States from all sources on 
physician and clinical services for the years 2000-2014 are shown in the bar graph 
and can be modeled by the quadratic function
f(x) = —0.2901.x2 +  2 5 .9 0 *  +  2 9 1 .6 .
Here, x = 0  represents 2000, x = 1 represents 2001, and so on. Use the graph and the 
model to work each problem. See Example 6.

Graph a quadratic function.
Graphing a Quadratic Function /(x) = ax2 + bx + c
Step 1 
Determine whether the graph opens up or down.
• If a >  0, then the parabola opens up.
• If a <  0, then the parabola opens down.
Step 2 
Find the vertex. Use the vertex formula or complete the square.
Step 3 
Find any intercepts.
• To find the x-intercepts (if any), solve/(x) =  0.
• To find they-intercept, evaluate /(0 ).
Step 4 
Complete the graph. Plot the points found so far. Find and plot
additional points as needed, using symmetry about the axis.

O  CAUTION
Be careful when interpreting the meanings of the coordinates of the 
vertex. The first coordinate, x, gives the value for which the function 
value, y  or f(x), is a maximum ora minimum.
Read the problem carefully to determine whether to find the value of 
the independent variable, the function value, or both.

The graph shows how Social Security trust fund assets are expected 
to change, and suggests that a quadratic function would be a good 
fit to the data. The data are approximated by the function
/ ( * )  =  —2 0 .5 7 * 2 +  7 5 8 .9 *  -  3 1 4 0 .
In the model, x  =  10 represents 2 0 1 0 , x  =  15 represents 2 0 1 5 , and 
so on, and f(x) is in billions of dollars.

Quadratic Inequality
A quadratic inequality (in x here) can be written in the form
ax2 +  bx +  c <  0, 
ax2 +  bx +  c >  0,
ax2 +  bx +  c ^  0, 
or 
ax2 +  bx +  c ^  0,

Note
If the inequalities in Example 1 had used >  and < , the solution sets 
would have included thex-values of the intercepts, which make the qua­
dratic expression equal to 0. They would have been written in interval 
notation as
(—0
0 , -

and 
[ - 3 , 4 ] .
Square brackets would indicate that the endpoints —3 and 4 are included 
in the solution sets.

Solving a Quadratic Inequality
Step 1 Write the inequality as an equation and solve it.
Step 2 Use the solutions from Step 1 to determine intervals. Graph
the values found in Step 1 on a number Line. These values divide 
the number Line into intervals.
Step3 
Find the intervals that satisfy the inequality. Substitute a
test value from each interval into the original inequality to 
determine the intervals that satisfy the inequality. ALL numbers 
in those intervals are in the solution set. A graph of the solution 
set will usually look like one of these.
Step 4 Consider the endpoints separately. The values from Step 1 are
included in the solution set if the inequality is <  or > . They are 
notincluded if it is <  or > .

10.1 Composition of Functions
OBJECTIVE
▼
Q  Find the composition 
of functions.
OBJECTIVE
O  Find the composition of functions. The diagram in Figure 1
shows a function g that assigns, to each element x of set X , some element y 
of set Y. Suppose that a function /  takes each element of set Y  and assigns a 
value z of set Z. Then g and f  together assign an element x in X  to an element
z in Z.
The result of this process is a new function h, which takes an element x 
in X  and assigns it an element z in Z.
Figure 1
This function h is the com position of functions f  and g, written f  ° g.
Composition of Functions
The composite function, or composition, of functions/and gis defined by
( / ° 9 )  (x) = f ( g ( x ) ) ,
for a llx in the domain of g  such that g ( x )  is in the domain o f f .
Read /  ° g as " / o f g" (or " f compose g").
As a real-life example of how composite functions occur, consider the 
following retail situation.
A  $40 p a ir o f blue je a n s is on sale fo r  25% off. I f  we purchase 
the je a n s before noon, the retailer offers an additional 10% off.
W hat is the fin a l sale p rice o f the blue je a n s?
We might be tempted to say that the jeans are 35% off and calculate as follows.
$40 -  0.35 ($40) 
= $40 -  $14
Original price — Discount 
= Sale price
= $26 <---------This is not correct.
To find the correct final sale price, we must first find the price after taking 
25% off, and then take an additional 10% off that price.
Take 25% off the 
original price.
Take an additional 
10% off.
$40 -  0.25 ($40) 
-  $40 -  $10 
= $30----------
> $30-0 .1 0  ($30) 
= $30 -  $3 
= $27
This is the idea behind composition of functions.

Composition of Functions 649
As another real-life example of composition, 
suppose an oil well off the coast is leaking, with 
the leak spreading oil in a circular layer over the 
surface. See Figure 2.
At any time t, in minutes, after the beginning 
of the leak, the radius of the circular oil slick is 
given by r(t) = 51 feet. Because si(r) = irr2 gives 
the area of a circle of radius r, the area can be 
expressed as a function of time.

Q  Deride whether a function is one-to-one, and if it is, find 
its inverse. Suppose we define the function
G = {( - 2 , 2), ( - 1 , 1), (0, 0), (1, 3), (2, 5)}.
OBJECTIVES
▼
Q  Decide whether a function is 
one-to-one, and if it is, find its 
inverse.
e
 Use the horizontal line test to 
determine whether a function 
is one-to-one.
O  Find the equation of the inverse 
of a function.
O  Graph /  \  given the graph off.
We can form another set of ordered pairs from G by interchanging the x- and 
y-values of each pair in G. We can call this set F, so
F = {(2, - 2 ) , (1, - 1 ) , (0, 0), (3 ,1), (5, 2)}.
To show that these two sets are related as just described, F is called the inverse 
of G. For a function f  to have an inverse function, f  must be one-to-one.
One-to-One Function
In a one-to-one function, eachx-value corresponds to just oney-value, 
and eachy-value corresponds to just one x-value.
The function shown in Figure 3(a) is not one-to-one because the y-value 
7 corresponds to two x-values, 2 and 3. That is, the ordered pairs (2, 7) and 
(3, 7) both appear in the function. The function in Figure 3(b) is one-to-one.

For inverses f  and /  *, it follows that for all x in their domains,
(f ° f  ') (*) = * 
and 
( /  1 0/) ( * )  = x.
EXAMPLE 1
Finding Inverses of One-to-One Functions
Decide whether each function is one-to-one. If it is, find the inverse.
(a) F = { ( - 2 ,1), (-1 , 0), (0 ,1), (1, 2), (2, 2)}
Each x-value in F corresponds to just one y-value. However, the y-value 
1 corresponds to two x-values, —2 and 0. Also, the y-value 2 corresponds to 
both 1 and 2. Because some y-values correspond to more than one x-value, 
F is not one-to-one and does not have an inverse function.
(b) G = {(3, 1), (0,2), (2, 3), (4,0)}
Every x-value in G corresponds to only one y-value, and every y-value 
corresponds to only one x-value, so G is a one-to-one function. The inverse 
function is found by interchanging the x- and y-values in each ordered pair.
G~' = {(1,3), (2,0), (3, 2), (0,4)}
The domain and range of G become the range and domain, respectively,
of G~l.

Inverse Functions 655
OBJECTIVE
e  Use the horizontal line test to determine whether a function
is one-to-one. By graphing a function and observing the graph, we can use 
the horizontal line test to tell whether the function is one-to-one.
Horizontal Line Test
A function is one-to-one if every horizontal line intersects the graph of 
the function at most once.
The horizontal line test follows from the definition of a one-to-one 
function. Any two points that lie on the same horizontal line have the same 
y-coordinate. No two ordered pairs that belong to a one-to-one function may 
have the same y-coordinate. Therefore, no horizontal line will intersect the 
graph of a one-to-one function more than once.
e  Use the horizontal line test to 
determine whether each graph 
is the graph of a one-to-one 
function.
EXAMPLE 2
Using the Horizontal Line Test
Use the horizontal line test to determine whether each graph is the graph of 
a one-to-one function.
(a) 
y
Because the red horizontal line 
shown in Figure 4 intersects the graph 
in more than one point (actually three 
points), the function is not one-to-one.
(b) 
y
Every horizontal line will inter­
sect the graph in Figure 5 in exactly 
one point. This function is one-to- 
one.

EXAMPLE 3
Finding Equations of Inverses
Decide whether each equation represents a one-to-one function. If so, find 
the equation that defines the inverse.
(a) f(x) = 2x + 5
The graph of y = 2x + 5 is a nonvertical line, so by the horizontal line 
test, /  is a one-to-one function. Find the inverse as follows.
Step 1 
Step 2
Step 3
y = 2x + 5 
x = 2y + 5
2y = x — 5
x -  5
y  =
f ~ \ x )  =
x -  5
Let y — f(x).
Interchange x and y.
Subtract 5. 
Interchange sides.
Solve for y.
Divide by 2.
/
Replace y with f  1 (x).
Thus, f  1 is a linear function. In the function y = 2x + 5, the value of y 
is found by starting with a value of x, multiplying by 2, and adding 5. The
equation / -1(x) = 
for the inverse has us subtract 5, and then divide by 2.
An inverse is used to “undo” what a function does to the variable x.
(b) y = x2 + 2
This equation has a vertical parabola as its graph, so some horizontal 
lines will intersect the graph at two points. For example, both x = 3 and 
x = — 3 correspond to y = 11. Because of the x2-term, there are many pairs 
of x-values that correspond to the same y-value. This means that the function 
y = x2 + 2 is not one-to-one and does not have an inverse.
Alternatively, apply the steps for finding the equation of an inverse.
y = x 2 + 2
x = y 2 + 2 
Interchange x and y.
Remember 
both roots.
= ±  V x -  2
Solve for y.
Square root property
The last step shows that there are two y-values for each choice of x in (2, o°), 
so the given function is not one-to-one. It does not have an inverse.
(c) f  (x) -  ( x -  2)3
A cubing function like this is one-to-one. See the graph in Figure 6.
Step 1 
Step 2
y = ( x -  2)3 
x = ( y - 2  y
V x = ^ / ( y -  2 )3
x = y -  2
y = V^c + 2
Step 3 
f  J(x) =

Replace /( x )  w ith y.

and Letting x =  \  would give ( - 2 ) 1/ 2, which is not a real number.

Exponential Functions 663
The graph of f ( x ) = 2X is typical of the graphs of exponential functions 
of the form f(x) = ax, where a > 1.
The larger the value o f a, the faster the graph rises.
To see this, compare the graph of F(x) = 5X with the graph of f(x) = 2X in 
Figure 11. When graphing such functions, be sure to plot a sufficient number 
of points to see how rapidly the graph rises.
The vertical line test assures us that the graphs in Figures 10 and 11 
represent functions. These graphs also show an important characteristic of 
exponential functions where a > 1:
As x gets larger, y increases at a faster and faster rate.

©  Solve exponential equations of the form a* = ak forx. Until
this chapter, we have solved only equations that had the variable as a base, like 
x 2 = 8. In these equations, all exponents have been constants. An exponential 
equation is an equation that has a variable in an exponent, such as
9X = 27.
We can use the following property to solve many exponential equations.

Solving an Exponential Equation
Step 1 
Each side must have the same base. If the two sides of the
equation do not have the same base, express each as a power of 
the same base if possible.
Step 2 
Simplify exponents if necessary, using the rules of exponents. 
Step 3 
Set exponents equal using the property given in this section. 
Step 4 
Solve the equation obtained in Step 3.
Note
These steps cannot be applied to an exponential equation like 3X =  12 
because Step 1 cannot easily be done. A method for solving such equa­
tions is given later in the chapter.

Exponential Functions 667
The data graphed in Figure 14 are approximated by the exponential 
function
f(x) = 266(1.001)*,
where x is the number of years since 1750. Use this function and a calculator 
to approximate the concentration of carbon dioxide in parts per million, to 
the nearest unit, for each year.
(a) 1900
Because x represents the number of years since 1750,
x = 1900 -  1750 =150.
f(x) = 266(1.001)* 
/(150) = 266 (1.001)150 
/(150) -  309
Given function 
Let x = 150.
Evaluate with a calculator.
The concentration in 1900 was approximately 309 parts per million.
(b) 1950
f(x) = 266(1.001)* 
/(200) = 266 (1.001)200

EXAMPLE 7
Applying an Exponential Decay Function
The atmospheric pressure (in millibars) at a given altitude x, in meters, can 
be approximated by the exponential function
f(x) = 1038(1.000134) —X
for values of x between 0 and 10,000. Because the base is greater than 1 and 
the coefficient of x in the exponent is negative, the function values decrease 
as x increases. This means that as the altitude increases, the atmospheric 
pressure decreases. (Data from Miller, A. and J. Thompson, Elements of 
Meteorology, Fourth Edition, Charles E. Merrill Publishing Company.)
(a) According to this function, what is the pressure at ground level?

O  Define a logarithm. The
graph of y = 2X is the curve shown in blue 
in Figure 15. Because y = 2X defines a one- 
to-one function, it has an inverse function. 
Interchanging * and y gives
x = 2y, 
the inverse of y = 2X.
The graph of the inverse is found by re­
flecting the graph of y = 2X across the line 
y = x. The graph of the inverse x = 2V is the 
curve shown in red in Figure 15.
We can also write the equation of the 
red curve using a new notation that involves 
the concept of logarithm.

EXAMPLE 6
Solving an Application of a Logarithmic Function
The barometric pressure in inches of mercury at a distance of x miles from the 
eye of a typical hurricane can be approximated by the logarithmic function
f  (x) = 27 + 1.105 logio (* +  1).
(Data from Miller, A. and R. Anthes, Meteorology, Fifth Edition, Charles E. 
Merrill Publishing Company.)
Approximate the pressure 9 mi from the eye of the hurricane.
/ ( 9) = 27 + 1.105 log10 (9 + 1) 
/(9 ) = 27 + 1.105 log1010 
/(9 ) = 21 + 1.105(1)
/(9 ) = 28.105
Let x = 9 in the given function. 
Add inside the parentheses, 
logio 10 = 1 
Add.
The pressure 9 mi from the eye of the hurricane is 28.105 in.

10.5 Properties of Logarithms
OBJECTIVES
Q  Use the product rule for logarithms.
Q  Use the quotient rule for logarithms.
O  Use the power rule for logarithms.
G  Use properties to write alternative 
forms of logarithmic expressions.
Logarithms have been used as an aid to numerical calculation for several 
hundred years. Today the widespread use of calculators has made the use 
of logarithms for calculation obsolete. However, logarithms are still very 
important in applications and in further work in mathematics.
OBJECTIVE
_________ O  Use the product rule for logarithms. One way in which
logarithms are used is to change a problem of multiplication into one of 
addition. For example, we know that
log2 4 = 2, 
log2 8 = 3, 
and 
log2 32 = 5
Therefore, we can make the following statements.
log2 32 = log2 4 + log2 8 
5 = 2 + 3
log2 (4 * 8 ) =  log2 4 + log2 8 
32 = 4 • 8
This is an example of the product rule for logarithms.
Product Rule for Logarithms
Ifx ,y , and b are positive real numbers, where b ^  1, then the following 
holds true.
logb *y = log/,* + log6y
In words, the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the 
fa cto rs.
Exam ples:
log3 ( 4 * 7 )  =  log3 4 +  log3 7 
and 
logio 8  +  log™ 9 =  log™ ( 8  • 9)
To prove this rule, let m = log/, x and n = log/, y, and recall that
log/, x = m 
means 
Jf1 = x. 
log/,y = n 
means bn = y.
Now consider the product xy
xy = bm • bn 
xy = bm+n 
log/, xy = m  + n
Substitute.
Product rule for exponents 
Write in logarithmic form.
log/, xy = log/, x + log by 
Substitute for m and n
The last statement is the result we wished to prove.
Note
The word statement of the product rule for logarithms above can be 
restated by replacing the word "logarithm " with the word "exponent." 
The rule then becomes the fam iliar rule for m ultiplying exponential 
expressions:
The exponent of a product is equal to 
the sum of the exponents of the factors.

o Evaluate common logarithms using a calculator. Loga­
rithms are important in applications in biology, engineering, economics, 
and social science. In this section we find numerical approximations for 
logarithms. Traditionally, base 10 logarithms were used most often because our 
number system is base 10. Logarithms with base 10 are common logarithms.
logio x 
is abbreviated as 
log x ,
where the base is understood to be 10.
In Example 1, we evaluate some common logarithms using a calculator 
with a (L0G i  key. We express calculator approximations for logarithms to 
four decimal places.
o Evaluate each logarithm to 
four decimal places using a 
calculator as needed.

(b) log 437,000 -  5.6405 
(d) log 106-1988 = 6.1988
Special property log/, br — r
In part (c), log 0.0615 ~  —1.2111 is a 
negative number. The common logarithm of 
a number between 0 and 1 is always nega­
tive because the logarithm is the exponent 
on 10 that produces the number. In this case, 
we have
10-1.2111
0.0615.
If the exponent (the logarithm) were positive, 
the result would be greater than 1 because 
10° = 1. The graph in Figure 18 illustrates 
these concepts.

is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. Water, for example,

EXAMPLE 2
Using pH in an Application
Wetlands are classified as bogs, fens, marshes, and swamps on the basis 
of pH values. A pH value between 6.0 and 7.5, such as that of Summerby 
Swamp in Michigan’s Hiawatha National Forest, indicates that the wet­
land is a “rich fen.” When the pH is between 3.0 and 6.0, the wetland is 
a “poor fen,” and if the pH falls to 3.0 or less, it is a “bog.” (Data from 
Mohlenbrock, R., “Summerby Swamp, Michigan,” Natural History.)
e  Solve the problem.
Find the pH of water with a 
hydronium ion concentration of 
1.2 X 10~3 mole per liter. If this 
water had been taken from a 
wetland, is the wetland a rich 
fen, a poor fen, or a bogl
Suppose that the hydronium ion concentration of a sample of water from a 
wetland is 6.3 X 10~3 mole per liter. How would this wetland be classified?
Use the definition of pH.
pH = -lo g [H 30 +] 
pH = -log (6.3 X 10“3) 
pH = — (log 6.3 + log 10~3) 
Product rule
pH ~  —[0.7993 -  3]

graph of the function at most once.
Inverse Functions
For a one-to-one function f  defined by an equation y = f(x), 
find the defining equation of the inverse f~l as follows.
Step 1 Interchange x and y.
Find f  1 if f(x) = 2x — 3. The graph of /  is a slanted straight 
line, so f  is one-to-one by the horizontal line test.
y = 2x -  3

In general, the graph of / -1 is the mirror image of the graph

Exponential and Logarithmic Equations 
and Their Applications
To solve exponential equations, use these properties 
(where b > 0, b 
1).
1. If bx = by, then x = y.
2. If x = y (* >  0,j? >  0), then log* x = log*y.
To solve logarithmic equations, use these properties (where 
b > 0,b #  l,* > 0 ,y > 0 ) . First use the product rule, 
quotient rule, power rule, or special properties, if necessary, 
to write the equation in the proper form.
1. If log* x = log* y, then x = y.
2. If log* x = y, then by = x.

Factor.
x + 20 = 0
or * — 5 = 0 
Zero-factor property
* = — 20 or

Solve each equation.
The value — 20 must be rejected as a solution because it 
leads to the logarithm of at least one negative number in the 
original equation. Check that the only solution is 5, so the 
solution set is { 5 } .

OBJECTIVES
▼
Q  Recognize graphs of the absolute 
value, reriprocal, and square root 
functions, and graph their 
translations.
©  Recognize and graph step 
functions.
OBJECTIVE
O  Recognize graphs of the absolute value, reciprocal, and 
square root functions, and graph their translations. The elementary func­
tion f ( x )  = |x| is the absolute value function. This function pairs each real 
number with its absolute value. Its graph is shown in Figure 1.
Absolute value function 
f(x) = 1*1
Domain: (—°°, go) 
Range: [0, °°)
Figure 1
Recall that the reciprocal function f ( x )  = j  pairs every real number 
except 0 with its reciprocal. Its graph is shown in Figure 2. Because x can 
never equal 0, as x gets closer and closer to 0, £ approaches either co or — co. 
Also, \ can never equal 0, and as x approaches co or — co, \ approaches 0. 
The axes are asymptotes for the function.
Figure 2
Reciprocal function
Domain: (— o°, 0) U (0, co) 
Range: (—a>,0) U (0, go)
The square root function f ( x )  = V r , also introduced earlier, pairs 
every nonnegative real number with its principal square root. See Figure 3.
Square root function
/(* ) = v 5
Domain: [0, °o) 
Range: [0, go)

Additional Graphs of Functions 715
The graphs of these elementary functions can be shifted, or translated.
EXAMPLE 1
Applying a Horizontal Shift
Graph f(x) = \ x — 2 |. Give the domain and range.
If x = 2, then f(x) = 0, which gives the lowest point on the graph (2, 0). 
The graph of f(x) = | x — 2 | has the same shape as that of f(x) = | * | but is 
shifted, or translated, 2 units to the right, as shown in Figure 4.

As seen in Example 1, the graph of
y = f(x  + h)
is a horizontal translation of the graph of y = f(x). In Example 2, we use 
the fact that the graph of
y = /(*) + k
is a vertical translation of the graph of y = f(x).

The graph, as shown in Figure 7, consists of a series of horizontal line 
segments. In each segment, the left endpoint is included and the right 
endpoint is excluded. These segments continue indefinitely following this 
pattern to the left and right. The appearance of the graph is the reason why 
this function is called a step function.
Greatest integer function

Domain: (— co9co)
Range: {..., —3, -2 ,-1 , 0, 1, 2, 3,...} 
(the set of integers)
The ellipsis points indicate that the graph 
continues indefinitely in the same pattern.
The graph of a step function also may be shifted. For example, the graph 
of h(x) = lx — 2] is the same as the graph of f(x) = [xfl shifted 2 units to 
the right. Similarly, the graph of g(x) = [xfl + 2 is the graph of f(x) shifted 
2 units up.

Q  Find an equation of a circle given its center and radius.
A circle is the set of all points in a plane that lie a fixed distance from a fixed

of a circle with radius r and center at (h, k). If (x, y) is 
a point on the circle, then the distance from the center

Reflecting property 
of an ellipse
Figure 15
Note
There are three possibilities for the graph of an equation of the form
( x -  h ) 2 +  ( y  -  k ) 2 =  m ,  
where m is a constant.
1. If m >  0, then r2 = m, and the graph of the equation is a circle with 
radius V m .
2. If m  = 0, then the graph of the equation is the single point (h, k).
3. If m <  0, then no points satisfy the equation, and the graph is non­
existent.
OBJECTIVE o Recognize the equation of an ellipse. An ellipse is the set
of all points in a plane the sum of whose distances from two fixed points is 
constant. These fixed points are the foci (singular: focus). The ellipse in 
Figure 14 has foci (c, 0) and (—c, 0), with x-intercepts (a, 0) and (—a, 0) 
and y-intercepts (0,/?) and (0 ,—/?). It can be shown in more advanced 
courses that c2 = a2 — b2 for an ellipse of this type. The origin is the center 
of the ellipse.

When a ray of light or sound emanating from one focus of an ellipse 
bounces off the ellipse, it passes through the other focus. See Figure 15. This 
reflecting property is responsible for whispering galleries. In the Old House 
Chamber of the U.S. Capitol, John Quincy Adams was able to listen in on 
his opponents’ conversations—his desk was positioned at one of the foci 
beneath the ellipsoidal ceiling, and his opponents were located across the 
room at the other focus. (See the chapter opener photo.)

Circles and Ellipses 725
Elliptical bicycle gears are designed to 
respond to the legs’ natural strengths and weak­
nesses. At the top and bottom of the powerstroke, 
where the legs have the least leverage, the gear 
offers little resistance, but as the gear rotates, the 
resistance increases. This allows the legs to apply 
more power where it is most naturally available. See Figure 16.

OBJECTIVE o Graph ellipses. To graph an ellipse centered at the origin, 
we plot the four intercepts and sketch the ellipse through those points.
n EXAMPLE 5
Graphing Ellipses
Graph each ellipse.
Here, a2 = 49, so a = 7, and the ^-intercepts for this ellipse are (7, 0) 
and (—7,0). Similarly, b2 = 36, so b = 6, and the y-intercepts for this 
ellipse are (0,6) and (0 ,-6 ). Plotting the intercepts and sketching the 
ellipse through them gives the graph in Figure 17.

The ^-intercepts for this ellipse are (6, 0) and (—6, 0), and the y-intercepts 
are (0, 11) and (0 ,-1 1 ). Join these intercepts with the smooth curve of an 
ellipse. See Figure 18.

Just as (x — 2)2 and (y + 3)2 would indicate that the center of a circle 
would be (2, —3), so it is with this ellipse. Figure 19 shows that the graph 
goes through the four points
(2,4), 
(7 ,-3 ), 
(2 ,-1 0 ), 
and 
(-3 ,-3 ).
The x-values of these points are found by adding ± a = + 5 to 2 (the x-value 
of the center). The y-values are found by adding ± b  = ± 7 to —3 (the 
y-value of the center).

Again, the center is not part 
of the actual graph, but

Graphs of circles and ellipses are not graphs of functions—they fail to 
meet the conditions of the vertical line test. The only conic section whose 
graph represents a function is the vertical parabola with equation

A lithotripter is a machine used to crush kidney stones using shock waves. The patient 
is placed in an elliptical tub with the kidney stone at one focus of the ellipse. A beam 
is projected from the other focus to the tub, so that it reflects to hit the kidney stone. 
See the figure.

11.3 Hyperbolas and Functions Defined by Radicals
OBJECTIVE o Recognize the equation of a hyperbola. A hyperbola is
the set of all points in a plane such that the absolute value of the difference of 
the distances from two fixed points (the foci) is constant. The graph of a 
hyperbola has two parts, or branches, and two intercepts (or vertices) that lie 
on its axis, called the transverse axis.
The hyperbola in Figure 20 has a horizontal transverse axis, with foci 
(c, 0) and (—c, 0) and x-intercepts (a, 0) and (—a, 0). (A hyperbola with 
vertical transverse axis would have its intercepts on the y-axis.)
A hyperbola centered at the origin has one of the following equations. 
(It is shown in more advanced courses that for a hyperbola, c2 = a2 + b2.)
OBJECTIVES
o Recognize the equation of a 
hyperbola.

EXAMPLE 3
Identifying the Graphs of Equations
Identify the graph of each equation.
(a) 9x2 = 108 + 12y2
Both variables are squared, so the graph is either an ellipse or a hyperbola. 
(This situation also occurs for a circle, which is a special case of an ellipse.) 
To see which conic section it is, rewrite the equation so that both the x2-term 
and y2-term are on one side of the equation and 1 is on the other side.
9x2 — 12 y2 =108 
Subtract 12y2.

Divide by 108
Because of the subtraction symbol, the graph of this equation is a hyperbola.
(b) x2 = y — 3
Only one of the two variables, x, is squared, so this is the 
vertical parabola with equation y = x2 + 3.
(c) x2 = 9 -  y2
Write the variable terms on the same side of the equation
xz + y2 = 9 
Add y2.
The graph of this equation is a circle with center at the origin and radius 3.

OBJECTIVE o Graph generalized square root functions. Recall that no
vertical line will intersect the graph of a function in more than one point. 
Thus, horizontal parabolas and all circles, ellipses, and hyperbolas with 
horizontal or vertical axes are examples of graphs that do not satisfy the con­
ditions of a function. However, by considering only a part of the graph of 
each of these, we have the graph of a function, as seen in Figure 23.

32. Using LORAN, a location-finding system, a radio 
transmitter at M sends out a series of pulses. When 
each pulse is received at transmitter S, it then sends 
out a pulse. A ship at P receives pulses from both M 
and S. A  receiver on the ship measures the difference 
in the arrival times of the pulses. A special map gives 
hyperbolas that correspond to the differences in 
arrival times (which give the distances d\ and d2 in the 
figure). The ship can then be located as lying on a 
branch of a particular hyperbola.

Suppose d\ = 80 mi and d2 = 30 mi, and the distance 
between transmitters M and S is 100 mi. Use the

Section 11.4 Nonlinear Systems of Equations 739
11.4 Nonlinear Systems of Equations
An equation in which some terms have more than one variable or a variable 
of degree 2 or greater is a nonlinear equation. A nonlinear system of
equations includes at least one nonlinear equation.
When solving a nonlinear system, it helps to visualize the types of graphs 
of the equations of the system to determine the possible number of points 
of intersection. For example, if a system includes two equations where the 
graph of one is a circle and the graph of the other is a line, then there may be 
zero, one, or two points of intersection, as illustrated in Figure 26.

(1)
2x — y = 3 
(2)
The graph of (1) is a circle and the graph of (2) is a line. The graphs could 
intersect in zero, one, or two points, as shown in Figure 26. We begin by 
solving the linear equation (2) for one of its two variables.
2x — y = 3
(2)
y = 2x — 3 
Solve for y. 
(3)
Then we substitute 2x — 3 for y in the nonlinear equation (1)
xz + y 2 = 9
(1)
x 2 + (2x — 3 )2 = 9 
Let y = 2x — 3.
Set both factors 
equal to 0.
2 + 4x2 -  12* + 9 = 9
5x2 — \2x = 0 
x ( 5 x -  12) = 0
x = 0 
or

If we let x = 0 in equation (3), y = 2x — 3, we obtain y = — 3. If x = =f in
equation (3), then y = |.  The solution set of the system is {(0, —3), ( y, f)} . 
The graph in Figure 27 confirms the two points of intersection.

Section 11.4 
Nonlinear Systems of Equations 743
If we substitute the x- values we found into equation (1) or (2) instead of 
into equation (3), we get extraneous solutions. It is always wise to check all 
solutions in both o f the given equations. We show a check for the ordered 
pair (/, ~2i).
CHECK Let x = i and y = —2i in both equations (1) and (2).
x 2 + 2xy -  y 2 = 7 
(1)
i2 + 2 (i) (— 2i) -  (—2/)2 = 7
i2 -  4/2 -  4/2 = 7

i2 -  4i2 = 3 
— 1 —4(—1) = 3 
i2 = - l
7 = 7 /  True
3 = 3 /  True
The other ordered pairs would be checked similarly. There are four ordered 
pairs in the solution set, two with real values and two with nonreal complex 
values. The solution set is
{(2. 1). ( - 2 ,- 1 ) , (/, ~ 2/), (—/, 2;)}.
The graph of the system, shown in Figure 31, shows only the two real 
intersection points because the graph is in the real number plane. In general, 
if solutions contain nonreal complex numbers as components, they do not 
appear on the graph.
o Solve each system.

Note
It is not essential to visualize the number of points of intersection of the 
graphs in order to solve a nonlinear system. Sometimes we are unfamiliar 
with the graphs or, as in Example 4, there are nonreal complex solutions 
that do not appear as points of intersection in the real plane. Visualizing 
the geometry of the graphs is only an aid to solving these systems.

OBJECTIVE
O  Graph second-degree inequalities. An inequality with at 
least one variable of degree 2 and no variable with degree greater than 2 is a 
second-degree inequality.
EXAMPLE 1
Graphing a Second-Degree Inequality
Graph x2 + y2 <  36.
The boundary of the inequality x2 + y2 <  36 is the graph of the equa­
tion x2 + y2 = 36, a circle with radius 6 and center at the origin, as shown 
in Figure 32.
The inequality x2 + y2 <  36 includes the 
points of the boundary (because the symbol < 
includes equality) and either the points “out­
side” the circle or the points “inside” the circle.
To decide which region to shade, we substitute 
any test point not on the circle.
We are testing the region.
x2 + y 2 <  36 
02 + 02 <  36 
Use (0, 0) as a test point.
0 <  36 
True
Because a true statement results, the original 
inequality includes the points inside the circle, 
the shaded region in Figure 32, and the boundary.
◄ Work Problem Q  at the Side.
EXAMPLE 2
Graphing a Second-Degree Inequality
Graph y <  — 2 (x — 4 )2 — 3.
The boundary, y = —2(x — 4)2 — 3, is a parabola that opens down with 
vertex at (4 ,-3 ). Decide whether to shade the region “inside” or “outside” 
the parabola.
y < —2(x — 4)2 — 3 
Original inequality
0 <  —2 (0 — 4 )2 — 3 
Use (0, 0) as a test point.
?
0 < -3 2  -  3
0 <  -3 5
Simplify.
False
Because the final inequality is a false state­
ment, the points in the region contain­
ing (0, 0) do not satisfy the inequality. In 
Figure 33, the parabola is drawn as a dashed 
curve because the points of the parabola it­
self do not satisfy the inequality. The region 
inside (or below) the parabola is shaded.

Second-Degree Inequalities and Systems of Inequalities 747
Note
Because the substitution is easy, the origin is the test point of choice 
unless the graph actually passes through (0, 0).
EXAMPLE 3
Graphing a Second-Degree Inequality
Graph 16y2 <  144 + 9x2.
Rewrite the inequality as follows.
16y2 — 9x2 <  144 
Subtract 9x2.
y
16 <  1
Divide by 144.
y
This form shows that the boundary is the following hyperbola.
/  _  x ^ = {
9 
16
Because the graph is a vertical hyperbola, 
the desired region will be either the region 
between the branches or the regions “above” 
the top branch and “below” the bottom 
branch. We choose (0, 0) as a test point.
16y2 <  144 + 9x2
16(0)2 <  144 + 9(0)2
0 <  144 
True
Because a true statements results, we shade 
the region between the branches containing 
(0, 0). See Figure 34.

 Graph x2 + 4y2 > 3 6 .
OBJECTIVE
0  Graph the solution set of a system of inequalities. If two
or more inequalities are considered at the same time, we have a system of 
inequalities. To find the solution set of the system, we find the intersection 
of the graphs (solution sets) of the inequalities in the system.
EXAMPLE 4
Graphing a System of Two Inequalities
Graph the solution set of the system.
x + 2y <  2
We begin by graphing the solution set of x — y <  4. The inequality 
includes the points of the boundary line x — y = 4 because the symbol <  
includes equality. The test point (0, 0) leads to a true statement in x - y  < 4, 
so we shade the region above the line. See Figure 35 on the next page.
The graph of the solution set of x + 2y <  2 does not include the bound­
ary line x + 2y = 2. Testing the point (0, 0) leads to a true statement, indicating 
that we should shade the region below the dashed boundary line. See Figure 36 
on the next page.

Graphing a System of Two Inequalities
Graph the solution set of the system.
2x + 3y >  6
x2 + y2 <  16
We begin by graphing the solution set of 2x + 3y >  6. The boundary 
line is the graph of 2x + 3y = 6 and is a dashed line because the symbol > 
does not include equality. The test point (0, 0) leads to a false statement in 
2x + 3y >  6, so we shade the region above the line, as shown in Figure 38.
The graph of x2 + y2 < 16 is the region inside of a dashed circle cen­
tered at the origin with radius 4. See Figure 39.

EXAMPLE 6
Graphing a System of Three Inequalities
Graph the solution set of the system.
x + y <  1
y ^  2x + 3 
^ - 2
We graph each inequality separately, on the same axes.
The graph of x + y <  1 is the region that 
lies below the dashed line x + y = 1.
y
• The graph of y <  2x + 3 is the region 
that lies below the solid line y = 2x + 3.
• The graph of y >  —2 is the region above 
the solid horizontal line y = —2.
Verify that the test point (0, 0) satisfies 
all three inequalities. Thus, the graph of the 
system, the intersection of these three graphs, 
is the triangular region enclosed by the three 
boundary lines in Figure 41, including two of 
its boundary lines.

EXAMPLE 7
Graphing a System of Three Inequalities
Graph the solution set of the system.
y >  x2 — 2x + 1
2x2 + y2 >  4 
y < 4
We graph each inequality separately, on the same axes.
• The graph of y = x2 — 2x + 1 is a parabola 
with vertex at (1,0). Those points inside 
(or above) the parabola satisfy the condi­
tion y > x2 — 2x + 1. Thus, the solution 
set of y >  x2 — 2x + 1 includes points on 
or inside the parabola.
• The graph of the equation 2x2 + y2 = 4 is 
an ellipse. We draw it as a dashed curve.
To satisfy the inequality 2x2 + y2 >  4, a 
point must lie outside the ellipse.
• The graph of y < 4 includes all points 
below the dashed line y = 4.
The graph of the system is the region shaded in Figure 42, which lies 
outside the ellipse, inside or on the boundary of the parabola, and below the 
line y = 4.

Q Q  Nonlinear Systems of Equations
Solving a Nonlinear System
A nonlinear system can be solved by the substitution method, 
the elimination method, or a combination of the two.
Geometric Interpretation
If, for example, a nonlinear system includes two second- 
degree equations, then there may be zero, one, two, three, 
or four solutions of the system.
This system has four 
solutions because there are 
four points of intersection.
Solve the system.
x2 + 2xy — y2 = 14 
(1)
x2 — y2 = —16 
(2)
Multiply equation (2) by — 1 and use the elimination method.
x2 + 2 x y - y 2= 14

Second-Degree Inequalities and 
Systems of Inequalities
Graphing a Second-Degree Inequality
To graph a second-degree inequality, graph the corresponding 
equation as a boundary and use test points to determine which 
region(s) form the solution set. Shade the appropriate region(s).
Graphing a System of Inequalities
The solution set of a system of inequalities is the intersection 
of the graphs (solution sets) of the inequalities in the system.
Graph y > x2 — 2x + 3.
The boundary is a 
parabola that opens up with 
vertex (1,2). Use (0, 0) as a 
test point. Substituting into the 
inequality y > x2 — 2x + 3 
gives a false statement,
0 > 3. 
False
Shade the region inside 
(or above) the parabola.
Graph the solution set of the 
system.

Any number multiplied by 1 remains the same. 
Example: f • 1 =  f
A fraction is in lowest terms when the numerator and denominator have 
no factors in common (other than 1).
Writing a Fraction in Lowest Terms
Step 1 
Write the numerator and denominator in factored form.
Step 2 
Replace each pair of factors common to the numerator and
denominator with 1.
Step3 
Multiply the remaining factors in the numerator and in the
denominator.
(This procedure is sometimes called "simplifying the fraction.")

Finding the Least Common Denominator (LCD)
To add or subtract fractions with different denominators, find the least
common denominator (LCD) as follows.
Step 1 
Write each denominator in prime factored form.
Step 2 
The LCD is the product of every (different) factor that appears in
any of the factored denominators. If a factor is repeated, use the 
greatest number of repeats as factors of the LCD.
Step 3 
Write each fraction with the LCD as the denominator, using the
second property of 1.

We begin by reviewing the terminology for the parts of a division problem. 
The divisor is the quantity we are dividing by, the dividend is the quantity 
we are dividing into, and the quotient is the result of the division.

a shortcut method called synthetic division can be used. For an illustration, 
look at the division on the left below.

On the right above, the same division is shown written without the 
variables. This is why it is essential to use 0 as a placeholder in synthetic 
division. All the numbers in color on the right are repetitions of the numbers 
directly above them, so we omit them to condense the work, as shown on the

OBJECTIVE 3©  Use the remainder theorem to evaluate a polynomial. We
can use synthetic division to evaluate polynomials. For example, in the 
synthetic division of Example 2, where the polynomial was divided by 
x — 2, the remainder was — 6.
Replacing x in the polynomial with 2 gives the following.
—4jc5 + x4 + 6x3 + 2x2 + 50 
= - 4  • 25 + 24 + 6 • 23 + 2 • 22 + 50
From Example 2 
Replace x with 2.

Evaluate the powers. 
= -128 + 16 + 48 + 8 + 50

This number, —6, is the same number as the remainder. Dividing by x — 2 
produced a remainder equal to the result when x is replaced with 2. This 
always happens, as the following remainder theorem states. This result is 
proved in more advanced courses.

Matrix
The numbers are the elements of the matrix. Matrices (the plural of matrix) 
are named according to the number of rows and columns they contain. The 
rows are read horizontally, and the columns are read vertically. This matrix 
is a 2 X 3 (read “two by three”) matrix because it has 2 rows and 3 columns. 
The number of rows followed by the number of columns gives the dimen­
sions of the matrix.

A square matrix has the same number of rows as columns. The 2 X 2  matrix 
above is a square matrix.
We now discuss a matrix method of solving linear systems that is a 
structured way of using the elimination method. The advantage of this new 
method is that it can be done by a graphing calculator or a computer.
OBJECTIVES
o Define a matrix.
Q  Write the augmented matrix of a 
system.
Q  Use row operations to solve a 
system with two equations.
Q  Use row operations to solve a 
system with three equations.
0
 Use row operations to solve 
special systems.
OBJECTIVE ► Q  Write the augmented matrix of a system. To solve a linear
system using matrices, we begin by writing an augmented matrix for the 
system. An augmented matrix has a vertical bar that separates the columns 
of the matrix into two groups. For example, to solve the system
jc -  3y = 1
2x + y = —5,
we start by writing the augmented matrix
Augmented matrix
Place the coefficients of the variables to the left of the bar, and the constants 
to the right.
781
A matrix is just a shorthand way o f writing a system o f equations, so the 
rows o f an augmented matrix can be treated the same as the equations 
o f a system o f equations.

Exchanging the position of two equations in a system does not change 
the system. Also, multiplying any equation in a system by a nonzero number 
does not change the system. Comparable changes to the augmented matrix of 
a system of equations produce new matrices that correspond to systems with 
the same solutions as the original system.
The following row operations produce new matrices that lead to systems 
having the same solutions as the original system.
Matrix Row Operations
1. Any two rows of the matrix may be interchanged.
2. The elements of any row may be multiplied by any nonzero real 
number.
3. Any row may be transformed by adding to the elements of the row 
the product of a real number and the corresponding elements of 
another row.

OBJECTIVE ! Q  Use row operations to solve a system with two equations.
Row operations can be used to rewrite a matrix until it is the matrix of a system 
whose solution is easy to find. The goal is a matrix in the form

Our goal is to use the various row operations to change this matrix into one 
that leads to a system that is easier to solve. It is best to work by columns.
We start with the first column and make sure that there is a 1 in the first 
row, first column position. There is already a 1 in this position.
Next, we introduce 0 in every position below the first. To obtain 0 in 
row two, column one, we add to the numbers in row two the result of multi­
plying each number in row one by —2. (We abbreviate this as —2Ri + R2.) 
Row one remains unchanged.

Answers to Selected Exercises
In this section we provide the answers that we think most students will 
obtain when they work the exercises using the methods explained in the 
text. If your answer does not look exactly like the one given here, it is not 
necessarily wrong. In many cases there are equivalent forms of the answer 
that are correct. For example, if the answer section shows 4 and your answer 
is 0.75, you have obtained the correct answer but written it in a different 
(yet equivalent) form. Unless the directions specify otherwise, 0.75 is just as 
valid an answer as
In general, if your answer does not agree with the one given in the 
text, see whether it can be transformed into the other form. If it can, then it 
is the correct answer. If you still have doubts, talk with your instructor.

51. / ( I )  =  1; /(2 ) =  2 
52. /(3 ) =  4; /(4 ) =  8; /(5 ) =  16 
53. /(3 ) =  4; /(4 ) =  8; /(5 ) =  16 
54. The pattern 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 
emerges, so most students predict 32 because the terms are doubling each 
time. However, /(6 ) = 31 (not 32). See the figure.

114. (a — b)2 = a2 — 2ab +  b2; This reinforces the special product for the 
square of a binomial difference.
115. 
The large square is made up of two smaller
a

squares and two congruent rectangles.
The sum of the areas is a2 + 2ab +  b2. 
Because (a + b)2 must represent the 
same quantity, they must be equal. Thus,
(.a +  b)2 =  a2 + 2 ab + b2.

1. The student stopped too soon. This is a sum of two terms, not a 
product, w2 — 8 must be factored out to obtain (w2 — 8) (2t + 5).
2. The polynomial was not factored completely. The binomial factor can 
be factored further as 2 (xy2 — 2), so the completely factored form is 
4^y3 (xy2 — 2).

The expression 6 — 4 V 3  cannot be simplified further.
34. In the denominator, V

5. There is no solution. The radical expression, 
which is nonnegative, cannot equal a negative number. The solution set is 0 . 
6. The proposed solution —3 is extraneous. Because the radical on the left 
side cannot be negative, and it must equal x, x  cannot be negative. The
solution set is {6}.

Answers to Selected Exercises A-23
SECTION 9.2
1. No. The fraction bar should extend under the term —b. The correct
—b ±  \ / b 2 — 4ac 
formula is x = ------------------------- . 
2. No. The patron forgot the
2  a
±  symbol in the numerator. (See the correct formula in the Exercise 1 answer.) 
3. The last step is wrong. Because 5 is not a common factor of the terms in 
the numerator, the fraction cannot be simplified further. The solution set is 
5 + V 5  5 -  V 5
<■

The quadratic formula can be used to solve

any quadratic equation. The equation can be written as 2x2 + Ox — 5 = 0, 
so it follows that a =  2, b = 0, and c =  —5. The solution set is

concentration corresponds to only one year. 
5. This function is not 
one-to-one because two sodas in the list have 41 mg of caffeine.

13. The division in the second step does not lead to x on the left side. By 
expressing each side using the same base, 2X = 25, we obtain the correct 
solution set, {5}. 
14. Subtracting 3 from each side in the second step does 
not help to obtain x. By expressing each side using the same base, 3X = 34,
we obtain the correct solution set, {4}.

65. Because every real number power of 1 equals 1, if y = log! x, then
x =  V and so x  = 1 for every y. This contradicts the definition of a function.
66. If the base is a negative number, say —2, then y =  log-2x. For a
y-value of —, x is not a real number. Also, for any odd y-value, such as 3, x  is
a negative number, which is outside the domain restriction for logarithmic 
functions. 67. x =  loga 1 is equivalent to ax — 1. The only value of x  that 
makes ax — 1 is 0. (Recall that a ^  1.) 
68. Because a1 = a for any 
positive real number a, the equivalent logarithmic statement loga a = 1

CHAPTER 1 Linear Equations 
and Applications
SECTION 1.1
37. 2 [ w -  ( 2 w  + 4) + 3] = 2 ( w +  1)
2 [w -  2w -  4 + 3] =  2(w + 1)
Distributive property
2 [—w — l] =2 (w + 1)
Combine like terms.
—2w — 2 = 2w + 2
Distributive property
- 2  =  4w + 2
Add 2w.
- 4  = 4w 
Subtract 2.
— 1 = w 
Divide by 4.
CH ECK Substitute — 1 for w in the original

u = 45.66 
The unearned interest is $45.66.
SECTION 1.3
31. Step 1
Read the problem again.
Step 2
Let 
x = the length of the middle side, 
x  — 75 = the length of the shortest side, 
x + 375 = the length of the longest side. 
Step 3
The perimeter of the Bermuda Triangle is 
3075 mi. Using the formula for perimeter 
of a triangle
P = a + b + c 
gives the following equation.
r + ( r - 7 5 )  +  ( r +  375) =  3075 
Step 4
3* + 300 =  3075 
Combine like terms. 
3x =  2775 
Subtract 300.
x =  925 
Divide by 3.
Step 5
The length of the middle side is 925 mi.
The length of the shortest side is
x -  75 = 925 -  75 = 850 mi.
The length of the longest side is
x + 375 = 925 + 375 =  1300 mi.
Step 6
The answer checks because
925 + 850 + 1300 = 3075 mi, 
which is the correct perimeter.
43. Let x = the amount of the receipts exclud­
ing tax. Because the sales tax is 9% of x, 
the total amount was as follows.
x + 0.09* = 2725 
1* + 0.09* = 2725 
1.09* = 2725
2725
* = -----
1.09
* = 2500
Thus, the tax was
0.09(2500) = $225.
57. Let * = the amount of $6 per lb nuts.

The total value of the $2-per-lb nuts and 
the $6-per-lb nuts must equal the value of
the $5-per-lb nuts.
100 + 6* = 5 (* + 50) 
I
100 + 6* = 5 * +  250 
"
* =  150 
He should use 150 lb of $6 nuts.
CHECK 50 lb of the $2-per-lb nuts are 
worth $100, and 150 lb of the $6-per-lb 
nuts are worth $900.
$ 100 + $900 = $ 1000, which is the same 
as (50 + 150) lb worth of $5-per-lb nuts.

0.01* + 0.10* + 0.25 (44 -  2*) = 4.37
0.01* + 0.10* + 11 -  0.5* = 4.37
Distributive property
