LETTER FROM THE AUTHOR
As of the late 1980s, the geometry textbooks written for the elementary college stu-
dent contained flaws in reasoning as well as errors and even contradictions. In those
textbooks, there seemed to be an overall lack of geometric figures that are essential to
visual reasoning. Using my collected notes and problems, I developed an outline for
the geometry textbook that would present the necessary topics in a logical order.
Providing descriptions and explanations that students could read and comprehend,
students were able to learn the vocabulary of geometry, recognize visual relationships,
solve problems, and even create some proofs of theorems as well. The textbook would
have to provide several exercises, many of them serving as building blocks that would
transition the student to mid-range and challenging problems and applications.
Without doubt, earlier editions of this textbook have evolved so that any improve-
ments would advance my early goals. In time, the Interactive Companion (for added
practice and reinforcement) was incorporated into the Student Study Guide. Both the
technology for geometry and the applications of geometry are evident throughout this
textbook.
As authors, Geralyn Koeberlein and I feel quite strongly that we have always
accurately and completely addressed the fundamental concepts of geometry, as sug-
gested by a number of professional mathematical associations. However, many of the
changes in the sixth edition are attributable to current users and reviewers of the fifth
edition. For instance, we chose to include an increased discussion of the parabola as
well as a new section dealing with three-dimensional coordinate geometry. As always,
we present new topics concisely and with easily understood explanations.
We continue to include the visual explanations of theorems that are enabled by
accurate and well-labeled figures. Comparable to the guidance provided by roadway
signs and GPS systems, the geometric figures found in this textbook provide guidance
for student readers too. Thus, students will have the tools, figures, and background to
“see” results intuitively, explore relationships inductively, and establish principles
deductively.
We believe that explanations are a necessary component of the geometry text-
book. As well as forcing us to look back (to review), these “proofs” are learning 
experiences within themselves. Our textbook presents these proofs in the most 
compact and understandable form that we can find. As the reader will discover, we
provide suggestions and insights into the construction of a proof whenever possible.
Writing this textbook for college students, I have incorporated my philosophy 
for the teaching of geometry. The student who is willing to study geometry and to
accept the responsibility and challenges herein will be well-prepared for advanced
mathematical endeavors and will also have developed skills of logic that are useful in
other disciplines.

Preface
As authors, we aim to help the students of the sixth edition of Elementary Geometry for
College Students become familiar with the terminology of geometry, explore (and perhaps
discover) geometric principles, strengthen their skills in deductive reasoning, and gain new
skills in problem solving, particularly in the area of geometry-based applications. Our style
of writing enables novices of geometric study to open doors, refreshes the memories of 
students who have had an earlier introduction to the subject, provides a different perspective
for other students, and even encourages and directs those who might someday be teaching
the subject matter.
As any classroom teacher of geometry would expect, we have developed this textbook
in a logical order and with features that are intuitive, informative, and motivational; as a
result, students are enabled to achieve the goals cited in the preceding paragraph. For this
textbook to be an effective learning tool, it is imperative that it contain a multitude of 
figures and illustrations; of course, this approach follows from the assumption that 
“A picture is worth a thousand words.”
We are well aware that the completion of a proof is quite the challenge for the student
of geometry. With this in mind, we seek initially to have the student recognize and 
appreciate the role of proof throughout the development of our geometry textbook. To
achieve this end, the student will initially be asked to follow the flow of a given proof. In
turn, the student should be able to supply missing pieces (statements and reasons) for 
the proof, thus recognizing a need to both order and justify one’s claims. Of course, the 
ultimate goal is that the student actually generate a geometric proof, beginning with writing
a lower-level proof and then progressing toward creating a higher-end proof.
For completeness, convenience, and compactness, we provide proof in a variety of
forms: the two-column proof, the paragraph proof, and the “picture” proof. A student’s 
actual creation of the two-column proof demonstrates the student’s understanding; that is, it
becomes evident that the student can both order and justify conclusions toward a desired
end. Our belief is that such accomplishments in the ability to reason extend themselves to
other disciplines; for instance, successful students will likely improve paragraph writing in
a composition class by improving the order, flow, and even the justification of their claims.
Also, the elements of logic found in the study of geometry may very well enable students
who are also or will be enrolled in a computer science class to create more powerful and
more compact subroutines in their computer codes.
In each edition, we have continued to be inspired and guided by both the National
Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) and the American Mathematical Association
of Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC). Of course, we encourage suggestions for content and
improvement in this textbook from those who are current users.
OUTCOMES FOR THE STUDENT
■Mastery of the essential concepts of geometry, for intellectual and vocational needs
■Preparation of the transfer student for further study of mathematics and geometry at
the senior-level institution
■Understanding of the step-by-step reasoning necessary to fully develop a
mathematical system such as geometry
■Enhancement of one’s interest in geometry through discovery activities, features,
and solutions to exercises

Foreword
In the sixth edition of Elementary Geometry for College Students, the topics that comprise
a minimal course include most of Chapters 1–6 and Chapter 8. For a complete basic course,
coverage of Chapters 1–8 is recommended. Some sections that can be treated as optional in
formulating a course description include the following:
■
Section 2.6 Symmetry and Transformations
■
Section 3.4 Basic Constructions Justified
■
Section 3.5 Inequalities in a Triangle
■
Section 5.6 Segments Divided Proportionally
■
Section 6.4 Some Constructions and Inequalities for the Circle
■
Section 7.1 Locus of Points
■
Section 7.2 Concurrence of Lines
■
Section 7.3 More About Regular Polygons
■
Section 8.5 More Area Relationships in the Circle
■
Section 10.6 The Three-Dimensional Coordinate System
Given that this textbook is utilized for three-, four-, and five-hour courses, the follow-
ing flowchart depicts possible orders in which the textbook can be used. As suggested by
the preceding paragraph, it is possible to treat certain sections as optional.
For students who need further review of related algebraic topics, consider these topics
found in Appendix A:
A.1: Algebraic Expressions
A.2: Formulas and Equations
A.3: Inequalities
A.4: Factoring and Quadratic Equations
A.5: The Quadratic Formula and Square Root Properties
Sections A.4 and A.5 include these methods of solving quadratic equations: the factor-
ing method, the square roots method, and the Quadratic Formula.
Logic appendices can be found at the textbook website. These include:

Line and Angle Relationships
Magical! In geometry, figures can be conceived to create an illu-
sion. Known as the Bridge of Aspiration, this passageway was con-
ceptualized by the Wilkinson Eyre Architects. It connects the Royal
Opera House and the Royal Ballet School in Covent Garden in
London, England. In this geometric design, 23 square portals are each
rotated slightly in order to create the illusion of a twisted passage.
Although a visual inspection of the bridge might have one think that
people would have to walk on walls to cross Floral Street below, it is
easy to walk upright. The architectural design successfully creates the
fluidity, grace, and spirit of the dance. This chapter opens with a dis-
cussion of the types of reasoning: intuition, induction, and deduction.
Additional topics found in Chapter 1 and useful for design include
tools of geometry, such as the ruler, protractor, and compass. By con-
sidering relationships between lines and angles, the remainder of the
chapter begins the logical development of geometry. For the geometry
student needing an algebra review, several topics are found in
Appendix A. Other topics are developed as needed.
Additional video explanations of concepts, sample problems, and applications are
available on DVD.

SETS
A set is any collection of objects, all of which are known as the elements of the set. 
The statement A  {1, 2, 3} is read, “A is the set of elements 1, 2, and 3.” In geometry, 
geometric figures such as lines and angles are actually sets of points.
Where A  {1, 2, 3} and B  {counting numbers}, A is a subset of B because each 
element in A is also in B; in symbols, 
. In Chapter 2, we will discover that T  {all 
A  B
triangles} is a subset of P  {all polygons}; that is, 
.

KEY CONCEPTS
Sets, Statements, and Reasoning
1.1
A statement is a set of words and/or symbols that collectively make a claim that can be
classified as true or false.
EXAMPLE 1
Classify each of the following as a true statement, a false statement, or neither.
1.
2. An angle has two sides. (See Figure 1.1.)
3. Robert E. Lee played shortstop for the Yankees.
4.
(This is read “7 is less than 3.”)
5. Look out!
SOLUTION 1 and 2 are true statements; 3 and 4 are false statements; 5 is not a 
statement.
Some statements contain one or more variables; a variable is a letter that represents a
number. The claim “
” is called an open sentence or open statement because it
can be classified as true or false, depending on the replacement value of x. For instance,
is true if
; for x not equal to 1, 
is false. Some statements con-
taining variables are classified as true because they are true for all replacements. Consider the
Commutative Property of Addition, usually stated in the form 
. In words,
this property states that the same result is obtained when two numbers are added in either or-
der; for instance, when 
and 
, it follows that 
.
The negation of a given statement P makes a claim opposite that of the original state-
ment. If the given statement is true, its negation is false, and vice versa. If P is a statement,
we use ~P (which is read “not P”) to indicate its negation.

EXAMPLE 2
Give the negation of each statement.
a)
b) All fish can swim
SOLUTION
a)
( means “is not equal to.”)
b) Some fish cannot swim. (To negate “All fish can swim,” we say that at least
one fish cannot swim.) 
A compound statement is formed by combining other statements used as “building
blocks.” In such cases, we may use letters such as P and Q to represent simple statements.
For example, the letter P may refer to the statement “
,” and the letter Q to the
statement “Babe Ruth was a U.S. president.” The statement “
and Babe Ruth
was a U.S. president” has the form P and Q, and is known as the conjunction of P and Q.
The statement “
or Babe Ruth was a U.S. president” has the form P or Q, and
is known as the disjunction of statement P and statement Q. A conjunction is true only
when P and Q are both true. A disjunction is false only when P and Q are both false. See
Tables 1.1 and 1.2.
EXAMPLE 3
Assume that statement P and statement Q are both true.
P:
Q: An angle has two sides.
Classify the following statements as true or false.
1.
and an angle has two sides.
2.
or an angle has two sides.
SOLUTION Statement 1 is false because the conjunction has the form “F and T.”
Statement 2 is true because the disjunction has the form “F or T.”
The statement “If P, then Q,” known as a conditional statement (or implication), is
classified as true or false as a whole. A statement of this form can be written in equivalent
forms; for instance, the conditional statement, “If an angle is a right angle, then it mea-
sures 90 degrees” is equivalent to the statement, “All right angles measure 90 degrees.”
EXAMPLE 4
Classify each conditional statement as true or false.
1. If an animal is a fish, then it can swim. (States, “All fish can swim.”)
2. If two sides of a triangle are equal in length, then two angles of the triangle
are equal in measure. (See Figure 1.2 below.)

SOLUTION Statements 1 and 2 are true. Statement 3 is false; Wendell may study yet
not receive an A.
In the conditional statement “If P, then Q,” P is the hypothesis and Q is the conclu-
sion. In statement 2 of Example 4, we have
Hypothesis: Two sides of a triangle are equal in length.
Conclusion: Two angles of the triangle are equal in measure.
For the true statement “If P, then Q,” the hypothetical situation described in P implies the
conclusion described in Q. This type of statement is often used in reasoning, so we turn our
attention to this matter.
REASONING
Success in the study of geometry requires vocabulary development, attention to detail and
order, supporting claims, and thinking. Reasoning is a process based on experience and
principles that allows one to arrive at a conclusion. The following types of reasoning are
used to develop mathematical principles.
Intuition
We are often inspired to think and say, “It occurs to me that. . . .” With intuition, a sudden in-
sight allows one to make a statement without applying any formal reasoning. When intuition
is used, we sometimes err by “jumping” to conclusions. In a cartoon, the character having the
“bright idea” (using intuition) is shown with a light bulb next to her or his head.
EXAMPLE 5
Figure 1.3 is called a regular pentagon because its five sides have equal lengths and its
five interior angles have equal measures. What do you suspect is true of the lengths of
the dashed parts of lines from B to E and from B to D?
SOLUTION Intuition suggests that the lengths of the dashed parts of lines (known as
diagonals of the pentagon) are the same.
NOTE 1: Using induction (and a ruler), we can verify that this claim is true. We will 
discuss measurement with the ruler in more detail in Section 1.2.
NOTE 2: Using methods found in Chapter 3, we could use deduction to prove that the
two diagonals do indeed have the same length.
The role intuition plays in formulating mathematical thoughts is truly significant. But to
have an idea is not enough! Testing a theory may lead to a revision of the theory or even to
its total rejection. If a theory stands up to testing, it moves one step closer to becoming
mathematical law.
Induction
We often use specific observations and experiments to draw a general conclusion. This type of
reasoning is called induction. As you would expect, the observation/experimentation process
is common in laboratory and clinical settings. Chemists, physicists, doctors, psychologists,

weather forecasters, and many others use collected data as a basis for drawing conclusions. In
our study of geometry, the inductive process generally has us use the ruler or the protractor (to
measure angles).
EXAMPLE 6
While in a grocery store, you examine several 6-oz cartons of yogurt. Although the
flavors and brands differ, each carton is priced at 75 cents. What do you conclude?
CONCLUSION Every 6-oz carton of yogurt in the store costs 75 cents.
As you may already know (see Figure 1.2), a figure with three straight sides is called
a triangle.
EXAMPLE 7
In a geometry class, you have been asked to measure the three interior angles of each
triangle in Figure 1.4. You discover that triangles I, II, and IV have two angles (as

of equal measure.

appears to be true of the stairs drawn?
ANSWER 
The stairs constantly rise or descend.
Deduction is the type of reasoning in which the knowledge and acceptance of selected
assumptions guarantee the truth of a particular conclusion.
DEFINITION
In Example 8, we illustrate a valid argument, a form of deductive reasoning used fre-
quently in the development of geometry. In this form, at least two statements are treated as
facts; these assumptions are called the premises of the argument. On the basis of the premises,
a particular conclusion must follow. This form of deduction is called the Law of Detachment.

EXAMPLE 8
If you accept the following statements 1 and 2 as true, what must you conclude?
1. If a student plays on the Rockville High School boys’ varsity basketball team,
then he is a talented athlete.
2. Todd plays on the Rockville High School boys’ varsity basketball team.
CONCLUSION Todd is a talented athlete.
To more easily recognize this pattern for deductive reasoning, we use letters to represent
statements in the following generalization.

2. P

NOTE: The symbol  means “therefore.”
In the preceding form, the statement “If P, then Q” is often read “P implies Q.” That is, 
when P is known to be true, Q must follow.
EXAMPLE 9
Is the following argument valid? Assume that premises 1 and 2 are true.
1. If it is raining, then Tim will stay in the house.
2. It is raining.
C. ‹ Tim will stay in the house.
CONCLUSION The argument is valid because the form of the argument is
1. If P, then Q
2. P
C. ‹ Q
with P = “It is raining,” and Q = “Tim will stay in the house.”
EXAMPLE 10
Is the following argument valid? Assume that premises 1 and 2 are true.
1. If a man lives in London, then he lives in England.
2. William lives in England.
C. ‹ William lives in London.
CONCLUSION The argument is not valid. Here, P = “A man lives in London,” and 
Q = “A man lives in England.” Thus, the form of this argument is

2. Q

We will use deductive reasoning throughout our work in geometry. For example, suppose
that you know these two facts:
1. If an angle is a right angle, then it measures 90°.
2. Angle A is a right angle.
Because the form found in statements 1 and 2 matches the form of the valid argument, you
may draw the following conclusion.
C. Angle A measures 90°.
VENN DIAGRAMS
Sets of objects are often represented by geometric figures known as Venn Diagrams. Their
creator, John Venn, was an Englishman who lived from 1834 to 1923. In a Venn Diagram,
each set is represented by a closed (bounded) figure such as a circle or rectangle. If state-
ments P and Q of the conditional statement “If P, then Q” are represented by sets of objects
P and Q, respectively, then the Law of Detachment can be justified by a geometric argu-
ment. When a Venn Diagram is used to represent the statement “If P, then Q,” it is absolutely
necessary that circle P lies in circle Q; that is, P is a subset of Q. (See Figure 1.5.)
EXAMPLE 11
Use Venn Diagrams to verify Example 8.
SOLUTION Let B  students on the Rockville High varsity boys’ basketball team.
Let A  people who are talented athletes.
To represent the statement “If a basketball player (B), then a talented athlete (A),” 
we show B within A. In Figure 1.6 we use point T to represent Todd, a person on the
basketball team (T in B). With point T also in circle A, we conclude that “Todd is a
talented athlete.”
The statement “If P, then Q” is sometimes expressed in the form “All P are Q.” For instance,
the conditional statement of Examples 8 and 11 can be written “All Rockville High School
basketball players are talented athletes.” Venn Diagrams can also be used to demonstrate
that the argument of Example 10 is not valid. To show the invalidity of the argument in 
Example 10, one must show that an object in Q may not lie in circle P. (See Figure 1.5.)
To represent a valid argument, the Law of Detachment would require that the first
statement has the form “If Q, then P.” Even though statement Q is true, it does not
enable us to draw a valid conclusion about P. Of course, if William lives in England, 
he might live in London; but he might instead live in Liverpool, Manchester, Coventry,
or any of countless other places in England. Each of these possibilities is a
counterexample disproving the validity of the argument. Remember that deductive
reasoning is concerned with reaching conclusions that must be true, given the truth of
the premises.

The compound statements known as the conjunction and the disjunction can also be 
related to the intersection and union of sets, relationships that can be illustrated by the use
of Venn Diagrams. For the Venn Diagram, we assume that the sets P and Q may have ele-
ments in common. (See Figure 1.7.)
The elements common to P and Q form the intersection of P and Q, which is written
P ¨ Q. This set, P ¨ Q, is the set of all elements in both P and Q. The elements that are in
P, in Q, or in both form the union of P and Q, which is written P ´ Q. This set, P ´ Q, is
the set of elements in P or Q.

CHAPTER 1 ■LINE AND ANGLE RELATIONSHIPS
Unless otherwise noted, all content on this page is © Cengage Learning.
In geometry, the terms point, line, and plane are described but not defined. Other concepts
that are accepted intuitively, but never defined, include the straightness of a line, the flat-
ness of a plane, the notion that a point on a line lies between two other points on the line,
and the notion that a point lies in the interior or exterior of an angle. Some of the terms
found in this section are formally defined in later sections of Chapter 1. The following are
descriptions of some of the undefined terms.
A point, which is represented by a dot, has location but not size; that is, a point has no
dimensions. An uppercase italic letter is used to name a point. Figure 1.8 shows points A,
B, and C.
The second undefined geometric term is line. A line is an infinite set of points. Given
any two points on a line, there is always a point that lies between them on that line. Lines
have a quality of “straightness” that is not defined but assumed. Given several points on a
line, these points form a straight path. Whereas a point has no dimensions, a line is one-
dimensional; that is, the distance between any two points on a given line can be measured.
Line AB, represented symbolically by 
, extends infinitely far in opposite directions, as
suggested by the arrows on the line. A line may also be represented by a single lowercase
letter. Figures 1.9(a) and (b) show the lines AB and m. When a lowercase letter is used to
name a line, the line symbol is omitted; that is, 
and m can name the same line.
Note the position of point X on 
in Figure 1.9(c). When three points such as A, X,
and B are on the same line, they are said to be collinear. In the order shown, which is sym-
bolized A-X-B or B-X-A, point X is said to be between A and B. When a drawing is not 
provided, the notation A-B-C means that these points are collinear, with B between A and
C. When a drawing is provided, we assume that all points in the drawing that appear to be
collinear are collinear, unless otherwise stated. Figure 1.9(d) shows that A, B, and C are
collinear; in Figure 1.8, points A, B, and C are noncollinear.
At this time, we informally introduce some terms that will be formally defined later.
You have probably encountered the terms angle, triangle, and rectangle many times. An 
example of each is shown in Figure 1.10.

Using symbols, we refer to Figures 1.10(a), (b), and (c) as ABC, DEF, and WXYZ,
respectively. Some caution must be used in naming figures; although the angle in Figure
1.10(a) can be called CBA, it is incorrect to describe the angle as ACB because that order
implies a path from point A to point C to point B . . . a different angle! In ABC, the point B
at which the sides meet is called the vertex of the angle. Because there is no confusion regard-
ing the angle described, ABC is also known as B (using only the vertex) or as 1. The
points D, E, and F at which the sides of DEF (also called DFE, EFD, etc.) meet are
called the vertices (plural of vertex) of the triangle. Similarly, W, X, Y, and Z are the vertices
of the rectangle; the vertices are named in an order that traces the rectangle.
A line segment is part of a line. It consists of two distinct points on the line and all
points between them. (See Figure 1.11.) Using symbols, we indicate the line segment by
; note that 
is a set of points but is not a number. We use BC (omitting the segment
symbol) to indicate the length of this line segment; thus, BC is a number. The sides of a 
triangle or rectangle are line segments. 
EXAMPLE 1
Can the rectangle in Figure 1.10(c) be named a) XYZW? b) WYXZ?
SOLUTION
a) Yes, because the points taken in this order trace the figure.
b) No; for example, 
is not a side of the rectangle.
MEASURING LINE SEGMENTS
The instrument used to measure a line segment is a scaled straightedge such as a ruler, a
yardstick, or a meter stick. Line segment RS (
in symbols) in Figure 1.12 measures 5 cen-
timeters. Because we express the length of 
by RS (with no bar), we write RS = 5 cm.
RS
RS
WY
BC
BC
Because manufactured measuring devices such as the ruler, yardstick, and meter stick
may lack perfection or be misread, there is a margin of error each time one is used. In Fig-
ure 1.12, for instance, RS may actually measure 5.02 cm (and that could be rounded from
5.023 cm, etc.). Measurements are approximate, not perfect.
Figure 1.12
In Example 2, a ruler (not drawn to scale) is shown in Figure 1.13. In the drawing, the
distance between consecutive marks on the ruler corresponds to 1 inch. The measure of a
line segment is known as linear measure.

MEASURING ANGLES
Although we formally define an angle in Section 1.4, we consider it intuitively at this time.
An angle’s measure depends not on the lengths of its sides but on the amount of open-
ing between its sides. In Figure 1.16, the arrows on the angles’ sides suggest that the sides
extend indefinitely.

The instrument shown in Figure 1.17 (and used in the measurement of angles) is a pro-
tractor. For example, we would express the measure of RST by writing m
; 
this statement is read, “The measure of RST is 50 degrees.” Measuring the angles in 
Figure 1.16 with a protractor, we find that m
and m

Some protractors show a full

known as a reflex angle.
Just as measurement with a ruler is not perfect, neither is measurement with a protractor.
The lines on a sheet of paper in a notebook are parallel. Informally, parallel lines lie
on the same page and will not cross over each other even if they are extended indefinitely.
We say that lines and m in Figure 1.19(a) are parallel; note here the use of a lowercase let-
ter to name a line. We say that line segments are parallel if they are parts of parallel lines;
if

Figure 1.17
To find the degree measure of an angle using a protractor:
1. Place the notch of the protractor at the point where the sides of the angle meet 
(the vertex of the angle). See point S in Figure 1.18.
2. Place the edge of the protractor along a side of the angle so that the scale reads “0.” 
See point T in Figure 1.18 where we use “0” on the outer scale.
3. Using the same (outer) scale, read the angle size by reading the degree measure that 
corresponds to the second side of the angle.
Warning
Many protractors have dual scales, as
shown in Figure 1.18.

For 
and 
, there are no common elements; for this reason,
we say that the intersection of A and B is the empty set (symbol is 
). Just as 
,
the parallel lines in Figure 1.19(a) are characterized by
.
EXAMPLE 5
In Figure 1.20, the sides of angles ABC and DEF are parallel (
to 
and 
to 
). 
Use a protractor to decide whether these angles have equal measures.
Figure 1.20
SOLUTION The angles have equal measures. Both measure 44°.
Two angles with equal measures are said to be congruent. In Figure 1.20, we see that
ABC  DEF. In Figure 1.21, ABC  CBD.
In Figure 1.21, angle ABD has been separated into smaller angles ABC and CBD; if the
two smaller angles are congruent (have equal measures), then angle ABD has been bisected.
In general, the word bisect means to separate a line segment (or an angle) into two parts of
equal measure; similarly, the word trisect means that the line segment (or angle) is sepa-
rated into three parts of equal measure.
Any angle having a 180° measure is called a straight angle, an angle whose sides are in
opposite directions. See straight angle RST in Figure 1.22(a). When a straight angle is bisected,
as shown in Figure 1.22(b), the two angles formed are right angles (each measures 90°).
When two lines have a point in common, as in Figure 1.23, they are said to intersect.
When two lines intersect and form congruent adjacent angles, they are said to be perpendi-
cular. In Figure 1.23, lines r and t are perpendicular if 
or 
, and so on.

CONSTRUCTIONS
Another tool used in geometry is the compass. This instrument, shown in Figure 1.24, is
used to draw circles and parts of circles known as arcs. 
The ancient Greeks insisted that only two tools (a compass and a straightedge) be used
for geometric constructions, which were idealized drawings assuming perfection in the use
of these tools. The compass was used to create “perfect” circles and for marking off seg-
ments of “equal” length. The straightedge could be used to draw a straight line through two
designated points.
A circle is the set of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a particular
point (known as the “center” of the circle). The part of a circle between any two of its points
is known as an arc. Any line segment joining the center to a point on the circle is a radius
(plural: radii) of the circle. See Figure 1.25.
Construction 1, which follows, is quite basic and depends only on using arcs of the
same radius length to construct line segments of the same length. The arcs are created by
using a compass. Construction 2 is more difficult to perform and explain, so we will delay
its explanation to a later chapter (see Section 3.4).
To construct a segment congruent to a given segment.  
GIVEN:

CONSTRUCT:

point D, as shown in Figure 1.26(b). Then

The following construction is shown step by step in Figure 1.27. Intuition suggests that
point M in Figure 1.27(c) is the midpoint of 
.
To construct the midpoint M of a given line segment AB.
GIVEN:

CONSTRUCT: M on 
so that 
CONSTRUCTION: Figure 1.27(a): Open your compass to a length greater than
one-half of 
.
Figure 1.27(b): Using A as the center of the arc, mark off an arc that extends
both above and below segment AB. With B as the center and keeping the 
same length of radius, mark off an arc that extends above and below 
so 
that two points (C and D) are determined where the arcs cross.

crosses

Relative to its point of departure or some other point of refer-

airplane is called its bearing. The bearing may also be used to
describe the direction in which the airplane or ship is moving.
By using an angle between 0 and 90 , a bearing is measured

A MATHEMATICAL SYSTEM
Like algebra, the branch of mathematics called geometry is a mathematical system. The for-
mal study of a mathematical system begins with undefined terms. Building on this founda-

CHARACTERISTICS OF A GOOD DEFINITION
Terms such as point, line, and plane are classified as undefined because they do not fit into
any set or category that has been previously determined. Terms that are defined, however,
should be described precisely. But what is a good definition? A good definition is like a
mathematical equation written using words. A good definition must possess four character-
istics, which we illustrate with a term that we will redefine at a later time.
certain properties (characteristics) of the system become apparent. These properties are
known as axioms or postulates of the system; more generally, such statements are called 
assumptions in that they are assumed to be true. Once we have developed a vocabulary and 
accepted certain postulates, many principles follow logically as we apply deductive methods.
These statements can be proved and are called theorems. The following box summarizes the
components of a mathematical system (sometimes called a logical system or deductive system).
In the definition, notice that: (1) The term being defined—isosceles triangle—is named. 
(2) The term being defined is placed into a larger category (a type of triangle). (3) The 
distinguishing quality (that two sides of the triangle are congruent) is included. 
(4) The reversibility of the definition is illustrated by these statements:
“If a triangle is isosceles, then it has two congruent sides.”
“If a triangle has two congruent sides, then it is an isosceles triangle.”
The reversibility of a definition is achieved by using the phrase “if and only if.” For 
instance, we could define congruent angles by saying “Two angles are congruent if 
and only if these angles have equal measures.” The “if and only if” statement has the 
following dual meaning:
“If two angles are congruent, then they have equal measures.”
“If two angles have equal measures, then they are congruent.”
When represented by a Venn Diagram, the definition above would relate set C = {con-
gruent angles} to set E = {angles with equal measures} as shown in Figure 1.30. The sets
C and E are identical and are known as equivalent sets.
Once undefined terms have been described, they become the building blocks for other
terminology. In this textbook, primary terms are defined within boxes, whereas related
terms are often boldfaced and defined within statements. Consider the following definition
(see Figure 1.31).

EXAMPLE 1
State the four characteristics of a good definition of the term “line segment.”
1. The term being defined, line segment, is clearly present in the definition.
2. A line segment is defined as part of a line (a category).
3. The definition distinguishes the line segment as a specific part of a line.
4. The definition is reversible.
i)
A line segment is the part of a line between and including two points.
ii) The part of a line between and including two points is a line segment.
INITIAL POSTULATES
Recall that a postulate is a statement that is assumed to be true.
Postulate 1 is sometimes stated in the form “Two points determine a line.” See Figure
1.32, in which points C and D determine exactly one line, namely 
. Of course, Postulate
1 also implies that there is a unique line segment determined by two distinct points used as
endpoints. Recall Figure 1.31, in which points A and B determine 
.
NOTE: In geometry, the reference numbers used with postulates (as in Postulate 1) need
not be memorized.
EXAMPLE 2
In Figure 1.33, how many distinct lines can be drawn through
a) point A?
b) both points A and B at the same time?
c) all points A, B, and C at the same time?
SOLUTION
a) An infinite (countless) number
b) Exactly one
c) No line contains all three points.
Recall from Section 1.2 that the symbol for line segment AB, named by its endpoints,
is 
. Omission of the bar from 
, as in AB, means that we are considering the length of
the segment. These symbols are summarized in Table 1.3.

A ruler is used to measure the length of a line segment such as 
. This length may be
represented by AB or BA (the order of A and B is not important). However, AB must be a
positive number.

We wish to call attention to the term unique and to the general notion of uniqueness.
The Ruler Postulate implies the following:
1. There exists a number measure for each line segment.
2. Only one measure is permissible.
Characteristics 1 and 2 are both necessary for uniqueness! Other phrases that may replace
the term unique include
One and only one
Exactly one
One and no more than one
A more accurate claim than the commonly heard statement “The shortest distance between
two points is a straight line” is found in the following definition.
As we saw in Section 1.2, there is a relationship between the lengths of the line segments
determined in Figure 1.34. This relationship is stated in the third postulate. The title and
meaning of the postulate are equally important! The title “Segment-Addition Postulate”
will be cited frequently in later sections.

In general, geometric figures that can be made to coincide (fit perfectly one on top of the
other) are said to be congruent. The symbol
is a combination of the symbol ~, which

ter can be used to name a plane. Because a plane (like a line) is infinite, we can show only
a portion of the plane or planes, as in Figure 1.41.
Figure 1.41
A plane is two-dimensional, consists of an infinite number of points, and contains an
infinite number of lines. Two distinct points may determine (or “fix”) a line; likewise, ex-
actly three noncollinear points determine a plane. Just as collinear points lie on the same
line, coplanar points lie in the same plane. In Figure 1.42, points B, C, D, and E are copla-
nar, whereas A, B, C, and D are noncoplanar.
In this book, points shown in figures are generally assumed to be coplanar unless 
otherwise stated. For instance, points A, B, C, D, and E are coplanar in Figure 1.43(a), as
are points F, G, H, J, and K in Figure 1.43(b).

On the basis of Postulate 5, we can see why a three-legged table sits evenly but a four-
legged table would “wobble” if the legs were of unequal length.
Space is the set of all possible points. It is three-dimensional, having qualities of
length, width, and depth. When two planes intersect in space, their intersection is a line. An
opened greeting card suggests this relationship, as does Figure 1.44(a). This notion gives

The intersection of two planes is infinite because it is a line. [See Figure 1.44(a) on
page 25.] If two planes do not intersect, then they are parallel. The parallel vertical planes
R and S in Figure 1.44(b) may remind you of the opposite walls of your classroom. The par-
allel horizontal planes M and N in Figure 1.44(c) suggest the relationship between the ceil-
ing and the floor.
Imagine a plane and two points of that plane, say points A and B. Now think of the line
containing the two points and the relationship of 
to the plane. Perhaps your conclusion
can be summed up as follows.

Because the uniqueness of the midpoint of a line segment can be justified, we call the
following statement a theorem. The “proof” of the theorem is found in Section 2.2.
If M is the midpoint of 
in Figure 1.45, then no other point can separate 
into two
congruent parts. The proof of this theorem is based on the Ruler Postulate. M is the point
that is located 
units from A (and from B).

are known as the sides of the angle. B, the common endpoint of these rays, is known as the
vertex of the angle. When three letters are used to name an angle, the vertex is always
named in the middle. Recall that a single letter or numeral may be used to name the angle.
The angle in Figure 1.46 may be described as

NOTE: In Chapters 1 to 10, the measures of most angles will be between 0 and 180,
including 180. Angles with measures between 180 and 360 are introduced in this 
section; these angles are not often encountered in our study of geometry.
TYPES OF ANGLES
An angle whose measure is less than 90 is an acute angle. If the angle’s measure is 
exactly 90, the angle is a right angle. If the angle’s measure is between 90 and 180, the
angle is obtuse. An angle whose measure is exactly 180 is a straight angle; alternatively,
a straight angle is one whose sides form opposite rays (a straight line). A reflex angle is
one whose measure is between 180 and 360. See Table 1.4 on page 30.
In Figure 1.47, 
contains the noncollinear points A, B, and C. Unless otherwise
stated or indicated (by an arc), 
is an acute angle. The three points A, B, and C also
determine a plane. The plane containing 
is separated into three subsets by the angle:
Points such as D are said to be in the interior of 
.
Points such as E are said to be on
.
Points such as F are said to be in the exterior of 
.
With this description, it is possible to state the Angle-Addition Postulate, which is the coun-
terpart of the Segment-Addition Postulate! Consider Figure 1.48 as you read Postulate 9.

CLASSIFYING PAIRS OF ANGLES
Many angle relationships involve exactly two angles (a pair)—never more than two angles
and never less than two angles!

In Figure 1.48, 
and 
are said to be adjacent angles. In this description,
the term adjacent means that angles lie “next to” each other; in everyday life, one might say
that the Subway sandwich shop is adjacent to the Baskin-Robbins ice cream shop. When
two angles are adjacent, they have a common vertex and a common side between them. In
Figure 1.48, 
and 
are not adjacent because they have interior points in com-
mon; notice that the common side 
does not lie between

CONSTRUCTIONS WITH ANGLES
In Section 1.2, we considered Constructions 1 and 2 with line segments. Now consider two
constructions that involve angle concepts. In Section 3.4, it will become clear why these
methods are valid. However, intuition suggests that the techniques are appropriate.
To construct an angle congruent to a given angle.
GIVEN:
in Figure 1.52(a)
CONSTRUCT: With 
as one side, 
CONSTRUCTION: Figure 1.52(b): With a compass, mark an arc to intersect both
sides of 
at points G and H.
Figure 1.52(c): Without changing the radius, mark an arc to intersect 
at K and
the “would-be” second side of 
.
Figure 1.52(b): Now mark an arc to measure the distance from G to H.
Figure 1.52(d): Using the same radius as in the preceding step, mark an arc with
K as center to intersect the would-be second side of the desired angle. Now
draw the ray from P through the point of intersection of the two arcs.
The resulting angle 
is the one desired, as we will prove in Section 3.4,
Example 1.
Just as a line segment can be bisected, so can an angle. This takes us to a fourth con-
struction method.
To construct the bisector of a given angle.
GIVEN:

CONSTRUCT:

To believe certain geometric principles, it is necessary to have proof. This section intro-
duces some guidelines for establishing the proof of these geometric properties. Several
examples are offered to help you develop your own proofs. In the beginning, the form of
proof will be a two-column proof, with statements in the left column and reasons in the
right column. But where do the statements and reasons come from?
To deal with this question, you must ask “What” is known (Given) and “Why” the
conclusion (Prove) should follow from this information. In correctly piecing together a
proof, you will usually scratch out several conclusions, discarding some and reordering the
rest. Each conclusion must be justified by citing the Given (hypothesis), a previously 
stated definition or postulate, or a theorem previously proved.
Selected properties from algebra are often used as reasons to justify statements. For
instance, we use the Addition Property of Equality to justify adding the same number to
each side of an equation. Reasons found in a proof often include the properties found in
Tables 1.5 and 1.6 on page 38.

Before considering geometric proof, we study algebraic proof in Examples 2 and 3.
Each statement in the proof is supported by the reason why we can make that statement
(claim). The first claim in the proof is the Given statement; and the sequence of steps must
conclude with a final statement representing the claim to be proved (called the Prove 
statement).
In Example 2, we construct the algebraic proof of the claim, “If 
then
” Where P represents the statement “
” and R represents “
” the
theorem has the form “If P, then R.” We also use letter Q to name the intermediate conclu-
sion “
” Using the letters P, Q, and R, we show the logical development for the
proof at the left. This logical format will not be provided in future proofs.

Informally, a vertical line is one that extends up and down, like a flagpole. On the other
hand, a line that extends left to right is horizontal. In Figure 1.59, 
is vertical and j is 
horizontal. Where lines and j intersect, they appear to form angles of equal measure.


Perpendicular lines do not have to be vertical and horizontal. In Figure 1.60, the slanted
lines m and p are perpendicular 
. As in Figure 1.60, a small square is often placed
in the opening of an angle formed by perpendicular lines.
Example 1 provides a formal proof of the relationship between perpendicular lines and
right angles. Study this proof, noting the order of the statements and reasons. The numbers
in parentheses to the left of the statements refer to the earlier statement(s) of the proof upon
which the new statement is based.

The relationship between perpendicular lines suggests the more general, but undefined, math-
ematical concept of relation. In general, a relation “connects” two elements of an associated
set of objects. Table 1.8 provides several examples of the concept of a relation R.

Any relation (such as congruence of angles) that has reflexive, symmetric, and transi-
tive properties is known as an equivalence relation. In later chapters, we will see that con-
gruence of triangles and similarity of triangles also have reflexive, symmetric, and
transitive properties; therefore, these relations are
also equivalence relations.
Returning to the formulation of a proof, the fi-
nal example in this section is based on the fact that
vertical angles are congruent when two lines inter-
sect. See Figure 1.62(a). Because there are two pairs
of congruent angles, the Prove could be stated
Prove:
and 
Such a conclusion is a conjunction and would be proved if both congruences were 
established. For simplicity, the Prove of Example 3 is stated
Prove:
Study this proof of Theorem 1.6.2, noting the order of the statements and reasons.
∠2  ∠4
∠2  ∠4
∠1  ∠3
EXAMPLE 2
Does the relation “is less than” for numbers have a reflexive property? a symmetric
property? a transitive property?
SOLUTION Because “
” is false, there is no reflexive property.
“If 
, then 
” is also false; there is no symmetric property.
“If 
and 
, then 
” is true; there is a transitive property.
NOTE: The same results are obtained for choices other than 2, 5, and 9.
Congruence of angles (or of line segments) is closely tied to equality of angle mea-
sures (or line segment measures) by the definition of congruence.

Geometry in Nature
There are three special properties that may exist for a given relation R. Where a, b, and
c are objects associated with relation R, the properties consider one object (reflexive), two ob-
jects in either order (symmetric), or three objects (transitive). For the properties to exist, it is
necessary that the statements be true for all objects selected from the associated set. These
properties are generalized, and specific examples are given below:

PROVE:
PROOF
Statements
Reasons
In the preceding proof, there is no need to reorder the congruent angles from state-
ment 7 to statement 8 because congruence of angles is symmetric; in the later work, 
statement 7 will be written to match the Prove statement even if the previous line does not
have the same order. The same type of thinking applies to proving lines perpendicular or
parallel: The order is simply not important!
CONSTRUCTIONS LEADING TO PERPENDICULAR LINES
Construction 2 in Section 1.2 determined not only the midpoint of 
but also that of the
perpendicular bisector of 
. In many instances, we need the line perpendicular to an-
other line at a point other than the midpoint of a segment.
To construct the line perpendicular to a given line at a
specified point on the given line.
GIVEN:
with point X in Figure 1.63(a)
CONSTRUCT: A line 
, so that 
CONSTRUCTION: Figure 1.63(b): Using X as the center, mark off arcs of equal
radii on each side of X to intersect 
at C and D.
Figure 1.63(c): Now, using C and D as centers, mark off arcs of equal radii
with a length greater than XD so that these arcs intersect either above 
(as shown) or below 
.
Calling the point of intersection E, draw 
, which is the desired line; that is,
.
The theorem that Construction 5 is based on is a consequence of the Protractor
Postulate, and we state it without proof.

1.7 ■The Formal Proof of a Theorem
51
Recall from Section 1.3 that statements that can be proved are called theorems. To under-
stand the formal proof of a theorem, we begin by considering the terms hypothesis and 
conclusion. The hypothesis of a statement describes the given situation (Given), whereas
the conclusion describes what you need to establish (Prove). When a statement has the form
“If H, then C,” the hypothesis is H and the conclusion is C. Some theorems must be 
reworded to fit into “If . . . , then . . .” form so that the hypothesis and conclusion are easy
to recognize.
EXAMPLE 1
Give the hypothesis H and conclusion C for each of these statements.
a) If two lines intersect, then the vertical angles formed are congruent.
b) All right angles are congruent.
c) Parallel lines do not intersect.
d) Lines are perpendicular when they meet to form congruent adjacent angles.
SOLUTION
a) As is
H: Two lines intersect.
C: The vertical angles formed are congruent.
b) Reworded
If two angles are right angles, then these angles are congruent.
H: Two angles are right angles.
C: The angles are congruent.
c) Reworded 
If two lines are parallel, then these lines do not intersect.
H: Two lines are parallel.
C: The lines do not intersect.
d) Reordered
When (if) two lines meet to form congruent adjacent angles, these
lines are perpendicular.
H: Two lines meet to form congruent adjacent angles.
C: The lines are perpendicular.
Why do we need to distinguish between the hypothesis and the conclusion? For a 
theorem, the hypothesis determines the Given and the Drawing. The Given provides 
a description of the Drawing’s known characteristics. The conclusion (Prove) determines
the relationship that you wish to establish in the Drawing.

The most difficult aspect of a formal proof is the thinking process that must take place
between parts 4 and 5. This game plan or analysis involves deducing and ordering conclu-
sions based on the given situation. One must be somewhat like a lawyer, selecting the
claims that help prove the case while discarding those that are superfluous. In the process
of ordering the statements, it may be beneficial to think in reverse order, like so:
The Prove statement would be true if what else were true?
The final proof must be arranged in an order that allows one to reason from an ear-
lier statement to a later claim by using deduction (perhaps several times). Where principle
P has the form “If H, then C,” the logical order follows.
H: hypothesis
—¬¬
statement of proof
P: principle
—¬¬
reason of proof
‹ C: conclusion

next statement in proof
Consider the following theorem, which was proved in Example 1 of Section 1.6.
EXAMPLE 2
Write the parts of the formal proof of Theorem 1.6.1.
SOLUTION
1. State the theorem.
If two lines are perpendicular, then they meet to form right angles.
2. The hypothesis is H: Two lines are perpendicular.
Make a Drawing to fit this description. 
(See Figure 1.65.)
3. Write the Given statement, using the 
Drawing and based on the hypothesis H: 
Two lines are
Given:
intersecting at E
4. Write the Prove statement, using the 
Drawing and based on the conclusion C: 
They meet to form right angles.
Prove:

5. Construct the Proof. This formal proof is 
found in Example 1, Section 1.6.

ESSENTIAL PARTS OF THE FORMAL PROOF OF A THEOREM
1. Statement: States the theorem to be proved.
2. Drawing: Represents the hypothesis of the theorem.
3. Given: Describes the Drawing according to the information found in the hypothesis of
the theorem.
4. Prove: Describes the Drawing according to the claim made in the conclusion of the 
theorem.
5. Proof: Orders a list of claims (Statements) and justifications (Reasons), beginning with
the Given and ending with the Prove; there must be a logical flow in this Proof.

CONVERSE OF A STATEMENT
The converse of the statement “If P, then Q” is “If Q, then P.” That is, the converse of a given
statement interchanges its hypothesis and conclusion. Consider the following:
Statement:
If a person lives in London, then that person lives in England.
Converse:
If a person lives in England, then that person lives in London.
As shown above, the given statement is true, whereas its converse is false. Sometimes the
converse of a true statement is also true. In fact, Example 3 presents the formal proof of
Theorem 1.7.1, which is the converse of Theorem 1.6.1.
Once a theorem has been proved, it may be cited thereafter as a reason in future
proofs. Thus, any theorem found in this section can be used for justification in proof prob-
lems found in later sections.
The proof that follows is nearly complete! It is difficult to provide a complete formal
proof that explains the “how to” and simultaneously presents the final polished form.
Example 3 illustrates the polished proof. You do not see the thought process and the
scratch paper needed to piece this puzzle together.
The proof of a theorem is not unique! For instance, students’ Drawings need not
match, even though the same relationships should be indicated. Certainly, different letters
are likely to be chosen for the Drawing that illustrates the hypothesis.

THEOREM 1.7.1
If two lines meet to form a right angle, then these lines are perpendicular.
Warning
You should not make a drawing that
embeds qualities beyond those
described in the hypothesis; nor
should your drawing indicate fewer
qualities than the hypothesis 
prescribes!

Give a formal proof for Theorem 1.7.1.

Several additional theorems are now stated, the proofs of which are left as exercises. This

a proof is less detailed, the impact of the explanation is the same! This is the first of 
several “picture proofs” found in this textbook. In Figure 1.67, the square is used to

THE DEVELOPMENT OF GEOMETRY
One of the first written accounts of geometric knowledge
appears in the Rhind papyrus, a collection of documents that
date back to more than 1000 years before Christ. In this docu-
ment, Ahmes (an Egyptian scribe) describes how north-south
and east-west lines were redrawn following the overflow of the
Nile River. Astronomy was used to lay out the north-south line.
The rest was done by people known as “rope-fasteners.” By
tying knots in a rope, it was possible to separate the rope into
segments with lengths that were in the ratio 3 to 4 to 5. The knots
were fastened at stakes in such a way that a right triangle would
be formed. In Figure 1.69, the right angle is formed so that one
side (of length 4, as shown) lies in the north-south line, and the
second side (of length 3, as shown) lies in the east-west line.
Figure 1.69
The principle that was used by the rope-fasteners is known as
the Pythagorean Theorem. However, we also know that the
ancient Chinese were aware of this relationship. That is, the
Pythagorean Theorem was known and applied many centuries
before the time of Pythagoras (the Greek mathematician for
whom the theorem is named).
Ahmes describes other facts of geometry that were known to
the Egyptians. Perhaps the most impressive of these facts was
that their approximation of 
was 3.1604. To four decimal places
of accuracy, we know today that the correct value of 
is 3.1416.
Like the Egyptians, the Chinese treated geometry in a very
practical way. In their constructions and designs, the Chinese
used the rule (ruler), the square, the compass, and the level.
Unlike the Egyptians and the Chinese, the Greeks formalized
and expanded the knowledge base of geometry by pursuing it as
an intellectual endeavor.
According to the Greek scribe Proclus (about 50 B.C.), Thales
(625–547 B.C.) first established deductive proofs for several of
the known theorems of geometry. Proclus also notes that it was
Euclid (330–275 B.C.) who collected, summarized, ordered, and
verified the vast quantity of knowledge of geometry in his time.
Euclid’s work Elements was the first textbook of geometry.
Much of what was found in Elements is the core knowledge of
geometry and thus can be found in this textbook as well.

PERSPECTIVE ON APPLICATIONS
PATTERNS
In much of the study of mathematics, we seek patterns related to
the set of counting numbers N  {1,2,3,4,5, . . .}. Some of these
patterns are geometric and are given special names that reflect
the configuration of sets of points. For instance, the set of square
numbers is shown geometrically in Figure 1.70 and, of course,
corresponds to the numbers 1, 4, 9, 16, . . . .
Figure 1.70
EXAMPLE 1
Find the fourth number in the pattern of triangular numbers
shown in Figure 1.71(a).
Figure 1.71(a)
SOLUTION Adding a row of 4 points at the bottom, we have
the diagram shown in Figure 1.71(b), which contains 10
points. The fourth triangular number is 10.
Figure 1.71(b)
Some patterns of geometry lead to principles known as postu-
lates and theorems. One of the principles that we will explore in
the next example is based on the total number of diagonals
found in a polygon with a given number of sides. A diagonal of
a polygon (many-sided figure) joins two non-consecutive ver-
tices of the polygon together. Of course, joining any two vertices
of a triangle will determine a side; thus, a triangle has no diago-
nals. In Example 2, both the number of sides of the polygon and
the number of diagonals are shown.
EXAMPLE 2
Find the total number of diagonals for a polygon of 6 sides.
Figure 1.72(a)
SOLUTION By drawing all possible diagonals as shown in
Figure 1.72(b) and counting them, we find that there are a
total of 9 diagonals!
Figure 1.72(b)
Certain geometric patterns are used to test students, as in testing
for intelligence (IQ) or on college admissions tests. A simple
example might have you predict the next (fourth) figure in the
pattern of squares shown in Figure 1.73(a).
Figure 1.73(a)
We rotate the square once more to obtain the fourth figure as
shown in Figure 1.73(b).

A Look Back at Chapter 1
Our goal in this chapter has been to introduce geometry. We dis-
cussed the types of reasoning that are used to develop geometric
relationships. The use of the tools of measurement (ruler and pro-
tractor) was described. We encountered the four elements of a
mathematical system: undefined terms, definitions, postulates, and
theorems. The undefined terms were needed to lay the foundation
for defining new terms. The postulates were needed to lay the foun-
dation for the theorems we proved here and for the theorems that lie
ahead. Constructions presented in this chapter included the bisector
of an angle and the perpendicular to a line at a point on the line.
A Look Ahead to Chapter 2
The theorems we will prove in the next chapter are based on a pos-
tulate known as the Parallel Postulate. A new method of proof,
called indirect proof, will be introduced; it will be used in later
chapters. Although many of the theorems in Chapter 2 deal with
parallel lines, several theorems in the chapter deal with the angles
of a polygon. Symmetry and transformations will be discussed.

Parallel Lines
Breathtaking! The widest cable-stayed bridge in the world, the
Leonard P. Zakim Bridge (also known as the Bunker Hill Bridge) lies
at the north end of Boston, Massachusetts. Lying above the Charles
River, this modern design bridge was dedicated in 2002. Cables for
the bridge are parallel or nearly parallel to each other. The vertical
towers above the bridge are perpendicular to the bridge floor. In this
chapter, we consider relationships among parallel and perpendicular
lines. Thanks to the line relationships, we can establish a most impor-
tant fact regarding angle measures for the triangle in Section 2.4.
Another look at the Bunker Hill Bridge suggests the use of symmetry,
a topic that is given considerable attention in Section 2.6.
Additional video explanations of concepts, sample problems, and applications are
available on DVD.

CHAPTER 2 ■PARALLEL LINES
Unless otherwise noted, all content on this page is © Cengage Learning.
PERPENDICULAR LINES
By definition, two lines (or segments or rays) are perpendicular if they meet to form 
congruent adjacent angles. Using this definition, we proved the theorem stating that 
“perpendicular lines meet to form right angles.” We can also say that two rays or line 
segments are perpendicular if they are parts of perpendicular lines. We now consider a
method for constructing a line perpendicular to a given line.
To construct the line that is perpendicular to a given line
from a point not on the given line.
GIVEN: In Figure 2.1(a), line 
and point P not on 
CONSTRUCT:
CONSTRUCTION: Figure 2.1(b): With P as the center, open the compass to a
length great enough to intersect 
in two points A and B.
Figure 2.1(c): With A and B as centers, mark off arcs of equal radii (using the
same compass opening) to intersect at a point Q, as shown.
Draw 
to complete the desired line.
In this construction, 
and 
are right angles. Greater accuracy is achieved
if the arcs drawn from A and B intersect on the opposite side of line 
from point P.
Construction 6 suggests a uniqueness relationship that can be proved.

THEOREM 2.1.1
From a point not on a given line, there is exactly one line perpendicular to the given line.
The term perpendicular includes line-ray, line-plane, and plane-plane relationships. In
Figure 2.1(c), 
. The drawings in Figure 2.2 on page 69 indicate two perpendicular
lines, a line perpendicular to a plane, and two perpendicular planes. 
PARALLEL LINES
Just as the word perpendicular can relate lines and planes, the word parallel can also be
used to describe relationships among lines and planes. However, parallel lines must lie in
the same plane, as the following definition emphasizes.

Parallel lines are lines in the same plane that do not intersect.
DEFINITION
More generally, two lines in a plane, a line and a plane, or two planes are parallel if
they do not intersect. Figure 2.3 illustrates possible applications of the word parallel.

EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY
The type of geometry found in this textbook is known as Euclidean geometry. In this
geometry, we interpret a plane as a flat, two-dimensional surface in which the line segment
joining any two points of the plane lies entirely within the plane. Whereas the postulate
that follows characterizes Euclidean geometry, the Perspective on Applications section
near the end of this chapter discusses alternative geometries. Postulate 10, the Euclidean
Parallel Postulate, is easy to accept because of the way we perceive a plane.
Consider Figure 2.5, in which line m and point P (with P not on m) both lie in plane R.
It seems reasonable that exactly one line can be drawn through P parallel to line m.
The method of construction for the unique line through P parallel to m is provided in
Section 2.3.
A transversal is a line that intersects two (or more) other lines at distinct points; all of
the lines lie in the same plane. In Figure 2.6, t is a transversal for lines r and s. Angles that
are formed between r and s are interior angles; those outside r and s are exterior angles.
Relative to Figure 2.6, we have
Interior angles:
, 
, 
, 
Exterior angles:
, 
, 
, 
Consider the angles in Figure 2.6 that are formed when lines are cut by a transversal.
Two angles that lie in the same relative positions (such as above and left) are called 
corresponding angles for these lines. In Figure 2.6, 
and 
are corresponding angles;
each angle is above the line and to the left of the transversal that together form the angle.
As shown in Figure 2.6, we have
Corresponding angles:
and 
above left
(must be in pairs)
and 
below left
and 
above right
and 
below right
Two interior angles that have different vertices and lie on opposite sides of the trans-
versal are alternate interior angles. Two exterior angles that have different vertices and lie
on opposite sides of the transversal are alternate exterior angles. Both types of alternate
angles must occur in pairs; in Figure 2.6, we have:
Alternate interior angles:
and 
(must be in pairs)
and 
Alternate exterior angles:
and 
(must be in pairs)
and 
PARALLEL LINES AND CONGRUENT ANGLES
In Figure 2.7, parallel lines 
and m are cut by transversal v. If a protractor were used to
measure 
and 
, these corresponding angles would have equal measures; that is, they
would be congruent. Similarly, any other pair of corresponding angles would be congru-
ent as long as

corresponding angles for r and s with transversal .
For and m of Figure 2.10 to be parallel as well, name two angles that would have to

In general, the conditional statement and its contrapositive are either both true or both
false! Similarly, the converse and the inverse are also either both true or both false. 
EXAMPLE 1
For the conditional statement that follows, give the converse, the inverse, and the con-
trapositive. Then classify each as true or false.
If two angles are vertical angles, then they are congruent angles.
SOLUTION
CONVERSE: If two angles are congruent angles, then they are vertical angles. (false)
INVERSE: If two angles are not vertical angles, then they are not congruent angles.
(false)
CONTRAPOSITIVE: If two angles are not congruent angles, then they are not vertical
angles. (true)

“If P, then Q” and “If not Q, then not P” are equivalent.
Venn Diagrams can be used to explain why the conditional statement 
and its
contrapositive 
are equivalent. The relationship “If P, then Q” is represented 
in Figure 2.11. Note that if any point is selected outside of Q (that is 
), then it cannot
possibly lie in set P (thus, 
).
THE LAW OF NEGATIVE INFERENCE (CONTRAPOSITION)
Consider the following circumstances, and accept each premise as true:
1. If Matt cleans his room, then he will go to the movie. (
)
2. Matt does not get to go to the movie. (
)
What can you conclude? You should have deduced that Matt did not clean his room; if he
had, he would have gone to the movie. This “backdoor” reasoning is based on the fact that
the truth of 
implies the truth of

Like the Law of Detachment from Section 1.1, the Law of Negative Inference (Law of
Contraposition) is a form of deduction. Whereas the Law of Detachment characterizes the
method of “direct proof” found in preceding sections, the Law of Negative Inference char-
acterizes the method of proof known as indirect proof.
INDIRECT PROOF
You will need to know when to use the indirect method of proof. Often the theorem to be
proved has the form 
, in which Q is a negation and denies some claim. For instance,
an indirect proof might be best if Q reads in one of these ways:
c is not equal to d
is not perpendicular to m
However, we will see in Example 5 of this section that the indirect method can be used
to prove that line 
is parallel to line m. Indirect proof is also used for proving existence
and uniqueness theorems; see Example 6.
The method of indirect proof is illustrated in Example 3. All indirect proofs in this
book are given in paragraph form (as are some of the direct proofs).
In any paragraph proof, each statement must still be justified. Because of the need to
order your statements properly, writing any type of proof may have a positive impact on
the essays you write for your other classes!
EXAMPLE 3
GIVEN: In Figure 2.12, 
is not perpendicular to 
PROVE:
and 
are not complementary
PROOF: Suppose that 
and 
are
complementary. Then 
because the sum of the measures of two 
complementary 
is 90. We also know that 
by the Angle-
Addition Postulate. In turn, 
by substitution. Then 
is a right angle. In
turn, 
. But this contradicts the given
hypothesis; therefore, the supposition must be 
false, and it follows that 
and 
are not complementary.
In Example 3 and in all indirect proofs, the first statement takes the form
Suppose/Assume the exact opposite of the Prove Statement.
By its very nature, such a statement cannot be supported even though every other statement
in the proof can be justified; thus, when a contradiction is reached, the finger of blame
points to the supposition. Having reached a contradiction, we may say that the claim
involving 
has failed and is false; in effect, the double negative 
is equivalent to
Q. Thus, our only recourse is to conclude that Q is true. Following is an outline of this
technique.

The contradiction found in an indirect proof often takes the form “Q and 
,” which 
cannot be true. Thus, the assumed statement 
has forced the conclusion 
, assert-
ing that 
is true. Then the desired theorem 
(which is equivalent to the 
contrapositive of 
) is also true.

EXAMPLE 4
Complete a formal proof of the following theorem:
If two lines are cut by a transversal so that corresponding angles are
not congruent, then the two lines are not parallel.
GIVEN: In Figure 2.13, 
and m are cut by transversal t
PROVE:
PROOF: Assume that 
. When these lines are cut by transversal t, any two 
corresponding angles (including 
and 
) are congruent. But 
by hypothesis. Thus, the assumed statement, which claims that 
, must be
false. It follows that 
. 
The versatility of the indirect proof is shown in the final examples of this section. The
indirect proofs preceding Example 5 contain a negation in the conclusion (Prove); the
proofs in the final illustrations use the indirect method to arrive at a positive conclusion.
EXAMPLE 5
GIVEN: In Figure 2.14, plane T intersects parallel planes P and Q in lines 
and 
m, respectively
PROVE:
PROOF: Assume that 
is not parallel to m. Then 
and m intersect at some
point A. But if so, point A must be on both planes P and Q, which means that
planes P and Q intersect; but P and Q are parallel by hypothesis. Therefore,
the assumption that 
and m are not parallel must be false, and it follows 
that

by the indirect method, use the following steps:
1. Suppose that

2. Reason from the supposition until you reach a contradiction.

therefore be true.

If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the pairs of interior angles on the same
side of the transversal are supplementary.
THEOREM 2.1.5
If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the pairs of exterior angles on the same
side of the transversal are supplementary.
THEOREM 2.3.1
If two lines are cut by a transversal so that two corresponding angles are congruent, then
these lines are parallel.
Suppose that we wish to prove that two lines are parallel rather than to establish an
angle relationship (as the previous statements do). Such a theorem would take the form “If
. . . , then these lines are parallel.” At present, the only method we have of proving lines
parallel is based on the definition of parallel lines. Establishing the conditions of the defi-
nition (that coplanar lines do not intersect) is virtually impossible! Thus, we begin to
develop methods for proving that lines in a plane are parallel by proving Theorem 2.3.1 by
the indirect method. Counterparts of Theorems 2.1.2–2.1.5, namely, Theorems
2.3.2–2.3.5, are proved directly but depend on Theorem 2.3.1. Except for Theorem 2.3.6,
the theorems of this section require coplanar lines.

line. When an auxiliary line is added to the drawing for a proof, a justification must be given
for the existence of that line. Justifications include statements such as

There is exactly one line through two distinct points.
An angle has exactly one bisector.
There is only one line perpendicular to another line at a point on that line.
When an auxiliary line is introduced into a proof, the original drawing is redrawn for
the sake of clarity. Each auxiliary figure must be determined, but not underdetermined
or overdetermined. A figure is underdetermined when more than one figure is possible.
On the other extreme, a figure is overdetermined when it is impossible for the drawing to
include all conditions described.
The first statement in the following “picture proof” establishes the auxiliary line that is
used. The auxiliary line is justified by the Parallel Postulate.

A theorem that follows directly from a previous theorem is known as a corollary of
that theorem. Corollaries, like theorems, must be proved before they can be used. These
proofs are often brief, but they depend on the related theorem. Some corollaries of
Theorem 2.4.1 follow. We suggest that the student make a drawing to illustrate each

2.5 ■Convex Polygons

Unless otherwise noted, all content on this page is © Cengage Learning.
Most polygons considered in this textbook are convex; the angle measures of convex
polygons are between 
and 
. Some convex polygons are shown in Figure 2.28; those
in Figure 2.29 are concave. A line segment joining two points of a concave polygon can
contain points in the exterior of the polygon. Thus, a concave polygon always has at least
one reflex angle. Figure 2.30 shows some figures that aren’t polygons at all!

Table 2.3 categorizes polygons by their number of sides.
With Venn Diagrams, the set of all objects under consideration is called the universe.
If P  {all polygons} is the universe, then we can describe sets T  {triangles} and 
Q  {quadrilaterals} as subsets that lie within the universe P. Sets T and Q are described
as disjoint because they have no elements in common. See Figure 2.31.

DIAGONALS OF A POLYGON
A diagonal of a polygon is a line segment that joins two nonconsecutive vertices.
Figure 2.32 shows heptagon ABCDEFG for which 
, 
, and 
are some
of the interior angles and 
, 
, and 
are some of the exterior angles. Because they
join consecutive vertices,

are some of the sides of the heptagon. Because
a diagonal joins nonconsecutive vertices of ABCDEFG,

many diagonals of the polygon.

When the number of sides of a polygon is small, we can list all diagonals by name.
For pentagon ABCDE of Table 2.4, we see diagonals 
, 
, 
, 
, and 
—a 
total of five. As the number of sides increases, it becomes more difficult to count all the 
diagonals. In such a case, the formula of Theorem 2.5.1 is most convenient to use.

Let us consider an informal proof of Theorem 2.5.2 for the special case of a pentagon.
The proof would change for a polygon of a different number of sides but only by the num-
ber of triangles into which the polygon can be separated. Although Theorem 2.5.2 is also
true for concave polygons, we consider the proof only for the case of the convex polygon.
PROOF
Consider the pentagon ABCDE in Figure 2.33, with auxiliary segments (diagonals from
one vertex) as shown.
The equations that follow are based upon the sum of the interior angles in 
triangles ABC, ACD, and ADE. Adding columns of angle measures, we have

A regular polygon is a polygon that is both equilateral and equiangular.
DEFINITION
The polygon in Figure 2.34(c) is a regular pentagon. Other examples of regular poly-
gons include the equilateral triangle and the square. In Chapter 3, we will prove that any
equilateral triangle is also equiangular.
Based upon the formula 
from Theorem 2.5.2, there is also a 
formula for the measure of each interior angle of a regular polygon having n sides. 
It applies to equiangular polygons as well.

equiangular octagon (Figure 2.35).
SOLUTION For an octagon, 
. Applying Corollary 2.5.3,
Each interior angle of the tile measures 
.
NOTE: For the octagonal tiles of Example 4, small squares are used as “fillers” to
cover the floor. The pattern, known as a tessellation, is found in Section 8.3.
EXAMPLE 5
Each interior angle of a certain regular polygon has a measure of 144°. Find its num-
ber of sides, and identify the type of polygon it is.
SOLUTION Let n be the number of sides the polygon has. All n of the interior angles
are equal in measure.
The measure of each interior angle is given by

same vertex and do not overlap.
What is the sum of measures of the
four angles?
ANSWER 
360°
COROLLARY 2.5.4
The sum of the measures of the four interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360°.
COROLLARY 2.5.5
The sum of the measures of the exterior angles of a polygon, one at each vertex, is 360°.
On the basis of Corollary 2.5.4, it is clearly the case that each interior angle of a square
or rectangle measures 90°.
The following interesting corollary to Theorem 2.5.2 can be established through 
algebra.
We now consider an algebraic proof for Corollary 2.5.5.
PROOF
A polygon of n sides has n interior angles and n exterior angles, if one is considered at each
vertex. As shown in Figure 2.36, these interior and exterior angles may be grouped into
pairs of supplementary angles such as 
and 
(read 
“prime”). Because there are
n pairs of angles, the sum of the measures of all pairs is 
degrees.
Of course, the sum of the measures of the interior angles is 
.
In words, we have
Where S represents the sum of the measures of the exterior angles,
The next corollary follows from Corollary 2.5.5. The claim made in Corollary 2.5.6 is
applied in Example 6.

EXAMPLE 6
Use Corollary 2.5.6 to find the number of sides of a regular polygon if each interior
angle measures 
. (Note that we are repeating Example 5.)
SOLUTION If each interior angle measures 
, then each exterior angle measures
(they are supplementary, because exterior sides of these adjacent angles form
a straight line).
Now each of the n exterior angles has the measure
In this case,

(a decagon) has 10 sides.
POLYGRAMS
A polygram is the star-shaped figure that results when the sides of convex polygons with
five or more sides are extended. When the polygon is regular, the resulting polygram is
also regular—that is, the interior acute angles are congruent, the interior reflex angles 
are congruent, and all sides are congruent. The names of polygrams come from the names
of the polygons whose sides were extended. Figure 2.37 shows a pentagram, a hexagram,
and an octagram. With congruent angles and sides indicated, these figures are regular
polygrams.

A figure has symmetry with respect to point P if for every point M on the figure, there
is a second point N on the figure for which point P is the midpoint of MN.
DEFINITION
On the basis of this definition, each point on ABCD in Figure 2.41(a) has a correspon-
ding point that is the same distance from P but which lies in the opposite direction from
P. In Figure 2.41(b), M and N are a pair of corresponding points. Even though a figure may
have multiple lines of symmetry, a figure can have only one point of symmetry. Thus, the
point of symmetry (when one exists) is unique.

TRANSFORMATIONS
In the following material, we will generate new figures from old figures by association of
points. In particular, the transformations included in this textbook will preserve the shape
and size of the given figure; in other words, these transformations preserve lengths and
angle measures and thus lead to a second figure that is congruent to the given figure. 
The types of transformations included are (1) the slide or translation, (2) the reflection,
and (3) the rotation. Each of these types of transformations is also called an isometry,
which translates to “same measure.”
Slides (Translations)
With this type of transformation, every point of the original figure is associated with a sec-
ond point by locating it through a movement of a fixed length and direction. In Figure 2.43,
is translated to the second triangle (its image 
) by sliding each point through
the distance and in the direction that takes point A to point D. The background grid is not
necessary to demonstrate the slide, but it lends credibility to our claim that the same length
and direction have been used to locate each point.

Reflections
With the reflection, every point of the original figure is reflected across a line in such a
way as to make the given line a line of symmetry. Each pair of corresponding points will
lie on opposite sides of the line of reflection and at like distances. In Figure 2.46, obtuse
triangle MNP is reflected across the vertical line 
to produce the image 
. The 
vertex N of the given obtuse angle corresponds to the vertex H of the obtuse angle in the
image triangle. With the vertical line as the axis of reflection, a drawing such as Figure
2.46 is sometimes called a horizontal reflection, since the image lies to the right of the
given figure. It is possible for the line of reflection to be horizontal or oblique (slanted).

SKETCH OF EUCLID
Names often associated with the early development of Greek
mathematics, beginning in approximately 600 B.C., include
Thales, Pythagoras, Archimedes, Appolonius, Diophantus,
Eratosthenes, and Heron. However, the name most often associ-
ated with traditional geometry is that of Euclid, who lived
around 300 B.C.
Euclid, himself a Greek, was asked to head the mathematics
department at the University of Alexandria (in Egypt), which
was the center of Greek learning. It is believed that Euclid told
Ptolemy (the local ruler) that “There is no royal road to geome-
try,” in response to Ptolemy’s request for a quick and easy
knowledge of the subject.
Euclid’s best-known work is the Elements, a systematic treat-
ment of geometry with some algebra and number theory. That
work, which consists of 13 volumes, has dominated the study of
geometry for more than 2000 years. Most secondary-level
geometry courses, even today, are based on Euclid’s Elements
and in particular on these volumes:
Book I:
Triangles and congruence, parallels, 
quadrilaterals, the Pythagorean theorem, 
and area relationships
Book III: Circles, chords, secants, tangents, and angle
measurement
Book IV:
Constructions and regular polygons
Book VI: Similar triangles, proportions, and the Angle
Bisector theorem
Book XI: Lines and planes in space, and parallelepipeds
One of Euclid’s theorems was a forerunner of the theorem of
trigonometry known as the Law of Cosines. Although the law is
difficult to understand now, it will make sense to you later. As
stated by Euclid, “In an obtuse-angled triangle, the square of the
side opposite the obtuse angle equals the sum of the squares of
the other two sides and the product of one side and the projec-
tion of the other upon it.”
While it is believed that Euclid was a great teacher, he is also
recognized as a great mathematician and as the first author of 
an elaborate textbook. In Chapter 2 of this textbook, 
Euclid’s Parallel Postulate has been central to our study of 
plane geometry.
PERSPECTIVE ON HISTORY
PERSPECTIVE ON APPLICATIONS
NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES
The geometry we present in this book is often described as
Euclidean geometry. A non-Euclidean geometry is a geometry
characterized by the existence of at least one contradiction of a
Euclidean geometry postulate. To appreciate this subject, you
need to realize the importance of the word plane in the Parallel
Postulate. Thus, the Parallel Postulate is now restated.
The Parallel Postulate characterizes a course in plane geom-
etry; it corresponds to the theory that “the earth is flat.” On a
small scale (most applications aren’t global), the theory works
well and serves the needs of carpenters, designers, and most
engineers.
To begin the move to a different geometry, consider the sur-
face of a sphere (like the earth). See Figure 2.53. By definition,
a sphere is the set of all points in space that are at a fixed dis-
tance from a given point. If a line segment on the surface of the
sphere is extended to form a line, it becomes a great circle (like
the equator of the earth). Each line in this geometry, known as
spherical geometry, is the intersection of a plane containing the
center of the sphere with the sphere.
Figure 2.53
Spherical (or elliptical) geometry is actually a model of
Riemannian geometry, named in honor of Georg F. B. Riemann
(1826–1866), the German mathematician responsible for the
next postulate. The Reimannian Postulate is not numbered in
this book, because it does not characterize Euclidean geometry.
m
(a)    and m are lines in
     spherical geometry
(b) These circles are not
      lines in spherical geometry
PARALLEL POSTULATE
In a plane, through a point not on a line, exactly one line is
parallel to the given line.

■Perspective on Applications
113
To understand the Reimannian Postulate, consider a sphere
(Figure 2.54) containing line 
and point P not on . Any line
drawn through point P must intersect in two points. To see this
develop, follow the frames in Figure 2.55, which depict an
attempt to draw a line parallel to 
through point P.
Figure 2.54
Consider the natural extension to Riemannian geometry of
the claim that the shortest distance between two points is a
straight line. For the sake of efficiency and common sense, a per-
son traveling from New York City to London will follow the
path of a line as it is known in spherical geometry. As you might
guess, this concept is used to chart international flights between
cities. In Euclidean geometry, the claim suggests that a person
tunnel under the earth’s surface from one city to the other.
A second type of non-Euclidean geometry is attributed to the
works of a German, Karl F. Gauss (1777–1855), a Russian,
Nikolai Lobachevski (1793–1856), and a Hungarian, Johann
Bolyai (1802–1862). The postulate for this system of non-
Euclidean geometry is as follows:
This form of non-Euclidean geometry is termed hyperbolic
geometry. Rather than using the plane or sphere as the surface
for study, mathematicians use a saddle-like surface known as a
hyperbolic paraboloid. (See Figure 2.56.) A line 
is the 
intersection of a plane with this surface. Clearly, more than one
plane can intersect this surface to form a line containing P that
does not intersect . In fact, an infinite number of planes inter-
sect the surface in an infinite number of lines parallel to 
and
containing P. Table 2.5 compares the three types of geometry.

A Look Back at Chapter 2
One goal of this chapter has been to prove several theorems based
on the postulate, “If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then
the pairs of corresponding angles are congruent.” The method of
indirect proof was introduced as a basis for proving lines parallel if
a pair of corresponding angles are congruent. Several methods of
proving lines parallel were then demonstrated by the direct method.
The Parallel Postulate was used to prove that the sum of the 
measures of the interior angles of a triangle is 
. Several 
corollaries followed naturally from this theorem. A formula was
then developed for finding the sum of the measures of the interior
angles of any polygon. The chapter closed with a discussion of
symmetry and transformations.
A Look Ahead to Chapter 3
In the next chapter, the concept of congruence will be extended to
triangles, and several methods of proving triangles congruent will
be developed. Several theorems dealing with inequality relation-
ships in a triangle will also be proved. The Pythagorean Theorem
will be introduced.

Majestic! In Statue Square of Hong Kong, the Bank of China 
(the structure shown at the left in the photograph above) rises 
1209 feet above the square. Designed by I. M. Pei (who studied at 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and also graduated from
the Harvard Graduate School of Design), the Bank of China displays
many triangles of the same shape and size. Such triangles, known as
congruent triangles, are also displayed in the Ferris wheel found in
Exercise 43 of Section 3.3. While Chapter 3 is devoted to the study 
of triangle types and their characteristics, the properties of triangles
developed herein also provide a much-needed framework for the
study of quadrilaterals found in Chapter 4.
Additional video explanations of concepts, sample problems, and applications are
available on DVD.

As always, any definition is reversible! If two triangles are known to be congruent, 
we may conclude that the corresponding parts are congruent. Moreover, if the six pairs 
of parts are known to be congruent, then so are the triangles! From the congruent parts
indicated in Figure 3.2, we can conclude that 
. Using the terminology
introduced in Section 2.6 and Figure 3.2, 
is the reflection of 
across a
vertical line (not shown) that lies midway between the two triangles. 
Following Figure 3.2 are some of the properties of congruent triangles that are useful
in later proofs and explanations. In the figure, notice that corresponding sides lie opposite
corresponding angles and conversely.

On the basis of the properties above, we see that the “congruence of triangles” is an
equivalence relation.
It would be difficult to establish that triangles were congruent if all six pairs of
congruent parts had to first be verified. Fortunately, it is possible to prove triangles
congruent by establishing fewer than six pairs of congruences. To suggest a first method,
consider the construction in Example 2.
EXAMPLE 2
Construct a triangle whose sides have the lengths of the segments provided in 
Figure 3.3(a).
SOLUTION Figure 3.3(b): Choose 
as the first side of the triangle (the choice of
is arbitrary) and mark its length as shown.

Figure 3.3(c): Using the left endpoint A, mark off an arc of length equal to that of
.
Now mark off an arc the length of 
from the right endpoint B so that these arcs
intersect at C, the third vertex of the triangle. Joining point C to A and then to B
completes the desired triangle.
Look again at Example 2. If a “different” triangle were constructed by choosing 
to be the first side, it would be congruent to the triangle shown; however, it might be 
necessary to flip or rotate it to have corresponding vertices match. The objective of
Example 2 is that it provides a method for establishing the congruence of triangles by
using only three pairs of their parts. If corresponding angles are measured in the given 
triangle and in the constructed triangle with the same lengths for sides, these pairs of
angles will also be congruent!

Figure 3.5
Informally, the term include names the part of a triangle that is “between” two other
named parts. In a triangle, two sides include an angle, while two angles include a side. The
two sides that include the angle actually form the angle. The two angles that include a side
share that side.
EXAMPLE 4
In 
of Figure 3.5(b):
a) Which angle is included by 
and 
?
b) Which sides include 
?
c) What is the included side for 
and 
?
d) Which angles include 
?
SOLUTION
a)
(because it is formed by 
and 
)
b)
and 
(because these form 
)
c)
(because it is the common side for 
and 
)
d)
and 
(because 
is a side of each angle)
SAS (METHOD FOR PROVING TRIANGLES CONGRUENT)
A second way of establishing that two triangles are congruent involves showing that two
sides and the included angle of one triangle are congruent to two sides and the included
angle of a second triangle. If two people each draw a triangle so that two of the sides mea-
sure 2 cm and 3 cm and their included angle measures 54°, then those triangles are con-
gruent. See Figure 3.6.

If two sides and the included angle of one triangle are congruent to two sides and the
included angle of a second triangle, then the triangles are congruent (SAS).
POSTULATE 13
The order of the letters SAS in Postulate 13 helps us to remember that the two sides that are
named have the angle “between” them; that is, the two sides referred to by S and S form the
angle, represented by A.
In Example 5 on page 126, the two triangles to be proved congruent share a common
side; the statement 
is justified by the Reflexive Property of Congruence, which
is conveniently expressed as Identity.
PN  PN
In a proof, Identity (also known as the Reflexive Property of Congruence) is the reason
cited when verifying that a line segment or an angle is congruent to itself.

ASA (METHOD FOR PROVING TRIANGLES CONGRUENT)
The next method for proving triangles congruent requires a combination of two angles and
the included side. If two triangles are drawn so that two angles measure 33° and 47° while
their included side measures 5 centimeters, then these triangles must be congruent. See the

If two angles and the included side of one triangle are congruent to two angles and the
included side of a second triangle, then the triangles are congruent (ASA).
POSTULATE 14
Although the method in Postulate 14 is written compactly as ASA, you must use caution
as you write these abbreviations that verify that triangles are congruent! For example, ASA
refers to two angles and the included side, whereas SAS refers to two sides and the included
angle. For us to apply any postulate, the specific conditions described in it must be satisfied.
SSS, SAS, and ASA are all valid methods of proving triangles congruent, but SSA is
not a method and cannot be used. In Figure 3.9 on page 127, the two triangles are marked
to demonstrate the SSA relationship, yet the two triangles are not congruent.

Another combination that cannot be used to prove triangles congruent is AAA.
See Figure 3.10. Three pairs of congruent angles in two triangles do not guarantee three
pairs of congruent sides!
In Example 6, the triangles to be proved congruent overlap (see Figure 3.11). To clar-
ify relationships, the triangles have been redrawn separately in Figure 3.12. In Figure 3.12,
the parts indicated as congruent are established as congruent in the proof. For statement 3,
Identity (or Reflexive) is used to justify that an angle is congruent to itself.

STRATEGY FOR PROOF ■Proving That Two Triangles Are Congruent

For the triangles shown, we can express their congruence
with the statement

vertices, express this congruence with a different statement.

(a) If 
can you prove that 
(b) If yes in part (a), by what reason are the triangles 
congruent?
6.
In a right triangle, the sides that form the right angle are 
the legs; the longest side (opposite the right angle) is the
hypotenuse. Some textbooks say that when two right 
triangles have congruent pairs of legs, the right triangles 
are congruent by the reason LL. In our work, LL is just a
special case of one of the postulates in this section. Which
postulate is that? 
7.
In

and

Using the reason Identity, name one pair of corresponding

angles of these triangles that must be congruent.

Recall that the definition of congruent triangles states that all six parts (three sides and three
angles) of one triangle are congruent respectively to the six corresponding parts of the 
second triangle. If we have proved that 
by SAS (the congruent parts are
marked in Figure 3.14), then we can draw further conclusions such as 
and
. The following reason (CPCTC) is often cited for drawing such conclusions and
is based on the definition of congruent triangles.

also congruent.

stated before we conclude that

STRATEGY FOR PROOF ■Proofs That Involve Congruent Triangles
Suggestions for a proof that involves congruent triangles:
1. Mark the figures systematically, using:
a) A square in the opening of each right angle
b) The same number of dashes on congruent sides
c) The same number of arcs inside congruent angles
2. Trace the triangles to be proved congruent in different colors.
3. If the triangles overlap, draw them separately.

RIGHT TRIANGLES
In a right triangle, the side opposite the right angle is the hypotenuse of that triangle, and
the sides of the right angle are the legs of the right triangle. These parts of a right triangle
are illustrated in Figure 3.18.
Another method for proving triangles congruent is the HL method, which applies
exclusively to right triangles. In HL, H refers to hypotenuse and L refers to leg. The proof
of this method will be delayed until Section 5.4.

THEOREM 3.2.1
If the hypotenuse and a leg of one right triangle are congruent to the hypotenuse and a
leg of a second right triangle, then the triangles are congruent (HL).
The relationships described in Theorem 3.2.1 (HL) are illustrated as marked in 
Figure 3.19. In Example 3, the construction based upon HL leads to a unique right triangle.

3.3 ■Isosceles Triangles
139
Unless otherwise noted, all content on this page is © Cengage Learning.
In an isosceles triangle, the two sides of equal length are legs, and the third side is the base.
See Figure 3.22. The point at which the two legs meet is the vertex of the triangle, and the
angle formed by the legs (and opposite the base) is the vertex angle. The two remaining
angles are base angles.
If 
in Figure 3.23, then 
is isosceles with legs 
and 
, base 
,
vertex C, vertex angle C, and base angles at A and B. With 
, we see that the base
of this isosceles triangle is not necessarily the “bottom” side.
Helping lines known as auxiliary lines are needed to prove many theorems. To this
end, we consider some of the lines (line segments) that may prove helpful. Each angle of
a triangle has a unique angle bisector; this may be indicated by a ray or segment from the
vertex of the bisected angle. See Figure 3.24(a). Just as an angle bisector begins at the ver-
tex of an angle, the median also joins a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. See
Figure 3.24(b). Generally, the median from a vertex of a triangle is not the same as the
angle bisector from that vertex. An altitude is a line segment drawn from a vertex to the
opposite side so that it is perpendicular to the opposite side. See Figure 3.24(c). Finally,
the perpendicular bisector of a side of a triangle is shown as a line in Figure 3.24(d). A
segment or ray could also perpendicularly bisect a side of the triangle.

Each triangle has three medians—one from each vertex to the midpoint of the
opposite side. As the medians are drawn for 
in Figure 3.28(a), it appears that the
three medians intersect at a point.
Each triangle has three angle bisectors—one for each of the three angles. As these are
shown for 
in Figure 3.28(b), it appears that the three angle bisectors have a point
in common. 
Each triangle has three perpendicular bisectors for its sides; these are shown for
in Figure 3.28(c). Like the altitudes, medians, and angle bisectors, the perpendicu-
lar bisectors of the sides also appear to meet at a single point.

The angle bisectors (like the medians) of a triangle always meet in the interior of the
triangle. However, the altitudes (like the perpendicular bisectors of the sides) can meet in
the exterior of the triangle; see Figure 3.28(c). The points of intersection described in this

Figure 3.30 and the following three descriptions, which are coded D for determined, U for
underdetermined, and O for overdetermined:
D: Draw a line segment from A perpendicular to 
so that the terminal point is
on 
. [Determined because the line from A perpendicular to 
is unique; 
see Figure 3.30(a).]
U: Draw a line segment from A to 
so that the terminal point is on 
.
[Underdetermined because many line segments are possible; see Figure 3.30(b).]
O: Draw a line segment from A perpendicular to 
so that it bisects 
.
[Overdetermined because the line segment from A drawn perpendicular to 
will not contain the midpoint M of 
; see Figure 3.30(c).]
For Example 2, an auxiliary segment will be needed. As you study the following
proof, note the uniqueness of the segment and its justification (reason 2) in the proof.

CHAPTER 3 ■TRIANGLES
General Rule: An early statement of the proof establishes the “helping line,” such as
the altitude or the angle bisector.
Illustration: See the second line in the proof of Example 2. The chosen angle bisector
leads to congruent triangles, which enable us to complete the proof.

Reasons
For the proof of Theorem 3.3.3, a different angle bisector (such as the bisector of 
)
would not lead to congruent triangles; that is, the choice of auxiliary line must lead to the
desired outcome!
Theorem 3.3.3 is sometimes stated, “The base angles of an isosceles triangle are 
congruent.” We apply this theorem in Example 3.
EXAMPLE 3

A consequence of Theorem 3.3.4 is that “A triangle with two congruent angles must
be an isosceles triangle.”
When all three sides of a triangle are congruent, the triangle is equilateral. If all 
three angles are congruent, then the triangle is equiangular. Theorems 3.3.3 and 3.3.4 
can be used to prove that the sets {equilateral triangles} and {equiangular triangles} are 
equivalent.

In some instances, a carpenter may want to get a quick, accurate measurement 
without having to go get his or her tools. Suppose that the carpenter’s square shown in 
Figure 3.33 is handy but that a miter box is not nearby. If two marks are made at lengths
of 4 inches from the corner of the square and these are then joined, what size angle is 
determined? You should see that each angle indicated by an arc measures 
.
Example 4 shows us that the converse of the theorem “The base angles of an 
isosceles triangle are congruent” is also true. However, see the accompanying Warning.

therefore equiangular) triangle. To accomplish this, mark off a line segment of
length a. From the endpoints of this line segment, mark off arcs with the same
radius length a. The point of intersection determines the third vertex of this 
equilateral triangle, whose angles measure 
each. 
Figure 3.41(c): By constructing the bisector of one angle, we determine an angle
that measures 
.

In Example 5, we justify the method for constructing a line perpendicular to a given
line from a point not on that line. In the example, point P lies above line .

In Example 6, we recall the method for constructing the line perpendicular to a given
line at a point on the line. We illustrate the technique in the example and ask that the 
student justify the method in Exercise 29. In Example 6, we construct an angle that mea-
sures

SOLUTION Figure 3.43(a): We begin by constructing a line segment perpendicular to
a given line 
at a point P on that line.
Figure 3.43(b): Next we bisect one of the right angles that was determined. The
bisector forms an angle whose measure is

As we saw in Example 4, constructing an equilateral triangle is fairly simple. It is also

The converse of Theorem 3.5.6 is also true. It is necessary, however, to use an indirect
proof to establish the converse. Recall that this method of proof begins by supposing the
opposite of what we want to show. Because this assumption leads to a contradiction, the
assumption must be false and the desired claim is therefore true.

THEOREM 3.5.7
If the measure of one angle of a triangle is greater than the measure of a second angle,
then the side opposite the larger angle is longer than the side opposite the smaller angle.
The proof of Theorem 3.5.7 depends on a fact known as the Trichotomy Property. It is 
stated below.
THE TRICHOTOMY PROPERTY
Given real numbers a and b, one and only one of the following statements can be true.
a  b,      a  b,      or      a  b
EXAMPLE 4
Prove Theorem 3.5.7 by using an indirect approach.
GIVEN:

(See Figure 3.53.)
PROVE:
PROOF: Given 
with 
, assume that 
. But if
, then 
, which contradicts the hypothesis. Also, if
, then it follows by Theorem 3.5.6 that 
, which also
contradicts the hypothesis. Thus, the assumed statement must be false; 
applying the Trichotomy Property, it follows that 
.
EXAMPLE 5
Given 
(not shown) in which 
and 
, write an 
extended inequality that compares the lengths of the three sides.
SOLUTION Because the sum of angles of

The perpendicular line segment from a point to a plane is the shortest line segment that
can be drawn from the point to the plane.
In Figure 3.55,

the hypotenuse of

, 
, 
, or any other line segment joining point P to a point in plane
R. With 
plane R, the length of 
is the distance from point P to plane R.
Our final theorem shows that no side of a triangle can have a length greater than or
equal to the sum of the lengths of the other two sides. In the proof, the relationship is val-
idated for only one of three possible inequalities. Theorem 3.5.10 is often called the
Triangle Inequality. See Figure 3.56.

the third side.
b) No, because 
c) No, because 
d) Yes, if 
or 
The alternative form of Theorem 3.5.10 was used in part (d) of Example 6 to show
that the length of the third side must be between 1 and 7.
Our final example illustrates a practical application of inequality relationships in 
triangles.
EXAMPLE 7
On a map, firefighters are located at points A and B. A fire has broken out at point C.
Which group of firefighters is nearer the location of the fire? (See Figure 3.57.)
Figure 3.57
SOLUTION With 
and 
, the side opposite 
has a
greater length than the side opposite 
; that is, 
. Because the dis-
tance from B to C is less than the distance from A to C, the firefighters at site B
should arrive at the fire located at C first.
NOTE: In Example 7, we assume that highways from A and B (to C) are equally 
accessible.

■Perspective on  Applications

SKETCH OF ARCHIMEDES
Whereas Euclid (see Perspective on History, Chapter 2) was a
great teacher and wrote so that the majority might understand
the principles of geometry, Archimedes wrote only for the very
well-educated mathematicians and scientists of his day.
Archimedes (287–212 B.C.) wrote on such topics as the measure
of the circle, the quadrature of the parabola, and spirals. In his
works, Archimedes found a very good approximation of . His
other geometric works included investigations of conic sections
and spirals, and he also wrote about physics. He was a great
inventor and is probably remembered more for his inventions
than for his writings.
Several historical events concerning the life of Archimedes
have been substantiated, and one account involves his detection of
a dishonest goldsmith. In that story, Archimedes was called upon
to determine whether the crown that had been ordered by the king
was constructed entirely of gold. By applying the principle of
hydrostatics (which he had discovered), Archimedes established
that the goldsmith had not constructed the crown entirely of gold.
(The principle of hydrostatics states that an object placed in a fluid
displaces an amount of fluid equal in weight to the amount of
weight the object loses while submerged.)
One of his inventions is known as Archimedes’ screw. This
device allows water to flow from one level to a higher level so
that, for example, holds of ships can be emptied of water.
Archimedes’ screw was used in Egypt to drain fields when the
Nile River overflowed its banks.
When Syracuse (where Archimedes lived) came under siege
by the Romans, Archimedes designed a long-range catapult that
was so effective that Syracuse was able to fight off the powerful
Roman army for three years before being overcome.
One report concerning the inventiveness of Archimedes has
been treated as false, because his result has not been duplicated.
It was said that he designed a wall of mirrors that could focus
and reflect the sun’s heat with such intensity as to set fire to
Roman ships at sea. Because recent experiments with concave
mirrors have failed to produce such intense heat, this account is
difficult to believe.
Archimedes eventually died at the hands of a Roman soldier,
even though the Roman army had been given orders not to harm
him. After his death, the Romans honored his brilliance with a
tremendous monument displaying the figure of a sphere
inscribed in a right circular cylinder.

PASCAL’S TRIANGLE
Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) was a French mathematician who
contributed to several areas of mathematics, including conic sec-
tions, calculus, and the invention of a calculating machine. But
Pascal’s name is most often associated with the array of numbers
known as Pascal’s Triangle, which follows:

Each row of entries in Pascal’s Triangle begins and ends with 
the number 1. Intermediate entries in each row are found by the 
addition of the upper-left and upper-right entries of the preceding
row. The row following 1

Applications of Pascal’s Triangle include the counting of subsets
of a given set, which we will consider in the following para-
graph. While we do not pursue this notion, Pascal’s Triangle is
also useful in the algebraic expansion of a binomial to a power
such as 
, which equals 
. Notice that the
multipliers in the product found with exponent 2 are 1

from a row of Pascal’s Triangle. In fact, the expansion 
leads to

SUBSETS OF A GIVEN SET
A subset of a given set is a set formed from choices of elements
from the given set. Because a subset of a set with n elements can
have from 0 to n elements, we find that Pascal’s Triangle pro-
vides a count of the number of subsets containing a given count-
ing number of elements.

A Look Back at Chapter 3
In this chapter, we considered several methods for proving triangles
congruent. We explored properties of isosceles triangles and justi-
fied construction methods of earlier chapters. Inequality relation-
ships for the sides and angles of a triangle were also investigated.
A Look Ahead to Chapter 4
In the next chapter, we use properties of triangles to develop the prop-
erties of quadrilaterals. We consider several special types of quadrilat-
erals, including the parallelogram, kite, rhombus, and trapezoid.

CHAPTER 3 ■TRIANGLES
In algebra, it is shown that 
; not by coincidence, the set
which has 0 elements, has 1 subset. Just as 
, the set
which has 1 element, has 2 subsets. The pattern continues so
that a set with 2 elements has 
subsets and a set with 
3 elements has 
subsets. A quick examination suggests
this fact:
The entries of the fifth row of Pascal’s Triangle correspond to
the numbers of subsets of the four-element set 
; of
course, the subsets of 
must have 0 elements, 1 ele-
ment each, 2 elements each, 3 elements each, or 4 elements each.
Based upon the preceding principle, there will be a total of
subsets for

SOLUTION The number of subsets is

Looking back at Example 1, we notice that the number of sub-
sets of the four-element set

which equals 16, or

in the following equivalent form:

Quadrilaterals
Comforting! Designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright
(1867–1959), this private home is nestled among the trees in the 
Bear Run Nature Preserve of southwestern Pennsylvania. Known as
Fallingwater, this house was constructed in the 1930s. The geometric
figure that dominates the homes designed by Wright is the quadrilat-
eral. In this chapter, we consider numerous types of quadrilaterals—
among them the parallelogram, the rhombus, and the trapezoid. 
Also, the language and properties for each type of quadrilateral are
developed. Each type of quadrilateral has its own properties and
applications. Many of these real-world applications can be found in
the examples and exercises of Chapter 4.
Additional video explanations of concepts, sample problems, and applications are
available on DVD.

CHAPTER 4 ■QUADRILATERALS
Unless otherwise noted, all content on this page is © Cengage Learning.
A quadrilateral is a polygon that has exactly four sides. Unless otherwise stated, the term
quadrilateral refers to a plane figure such as ABCD in Figure 4.1(a), in which the line seg-
ment sides lie within a single plane. When two sides of the quadrilateral are skew (not
coplanar), as with MNPQ in Figure 4.1(b), that quadrilateral is said to be skew. Thus,
MNPQ is a skew quadrilateral. In this textbook, we generally consider quadrilaterals
whose sides are coplanar.

A parallelogram is a quadrilateral in which both pairs of opposite sides are parallel. 
DEFINITION
In Figure 4.2(a), if 
and 
, then RSTV is a parallelogram. We sometimes
indicate parallel lines (and line segments) by showing arrows in the same direction. Thus,
Figure 4.2(b) emphasizes the fact that RSTV is a parallelogram. Because the symbol 
for parallelogram is 
, the quadrilateral in Figure 4.2(b) is 
. The set

General Rule: To prove that parts of a quadrilateral are congruent, we often use a 
diagonal as an auxiliary line to prove that triangles are congruent. Then we 
apply CPCTC.
Illustration: This strategy is used in the proof of Corollaries 4.1.2 and 4.1.3. In the
proof of Corollary 4.1.4, we do not need the auxiliary line.

In Example 3, we used the definition of a parallelogram to prove that a particular
quadrilateral was a parallelogram; however, there are other ways of establishing that a
given quadrilateral is a parallelogram. We will investigate those methods in Section 4.2.
For 
, 
and 
are altitudes to side 
(or to side 
), as shown in Figure 4.5(a).
With respect to side 
, sometimes called base 
, the length RW (or SX) is the height of
RSTV. Similarly, in Figure 4.5(b), 
and 
are altitudes to side 
(or to side 
).  Also,
the length TY (or ZS) is called the height of parallelogram RSTV with respect to side 
(or 
).
Next we consider an inequality relationship for the parallelogram. To develop this
relationship, we need to investigate an inequality involving two triangles. We will use, but
not prove, the following relationship found in Lemma 4.1.7.

LEMMA 4.1.7
If two sides of one triangle are congruent to two sides of a second triangle and the measure
of the included angle of the first triangle is greater than the measure of the included angle
of the second, then the length of the side opposite the included angle of the first triangle
is greater than the length of the side opposite the included angle of the second.

(See Figure 4.6.)
PROVE:
Now we can compare the lengths of the diagonals of a parallelogram. For a parallel-
ogram having no right angles, two consecutive angles are unequal but supplementary; thus,
one angle of the parallelogram will be acute and the consecutive angle will be obtuse. In
Figure 4.7(a) on page 174, 
has acute angle A and obtuse angle D. In Figure
4.7(b), diagonal 
lies opposite the obtuse angle ADC in

THEOREM 4.1.8
In a parallelogram with unequal pairs of consecutive angles, the longer diagonal lies
opposite the obtuse angle.
EXAMPLE 4
In parallelogram RSTV (not shown), 
.
a) Find the measure of 
.
b) Determine which diagonal (
or 
) has the greater length.
SOLUTION
a)
(
and 
are supplementary).
b) Because 
is obtuse, the diagonal opposite this angle is longer; that is, 
is
the longer diagonal.
We use an indirect approach to solve Example 5.
EXAMPLE 5
In parallelogram ABCD (not shown), 
and 
are diagonals, and 
.
Determine which angles of the parallelogram are obtuse and which angles are acute.
SOLUTION Because the longer diagonal 
lies opposite angles A and C, these
angles are obtuse. The remaining angles B and D are necessarily acute.
Our next example uses algebra to relate angle sizes and diagonal lengths.

SPEED AND DIRECTION OF AIRCRAFT
For the application in Example 7, we will indicate the velocity of an airplane or of the wind
by drawing a directed arrow. In each case, a scale is used on a grid in which a north-south
line meets an east-west line at right angles. Consider the sketches in Figure 4.9 and read
their descriptions.

In some scientific applications, such as Example 7, a parallelogram can be used to
determine the solution to the problem. For instance, the Parallelogram Law enables us to
determine the resulting speed and direction of an airplane when the velocity of the airplane
and that of the wind are considered together. In Figure 4.10, the arrows representing the
two velocities are placed head-to-tail from the point of origin. Because the order of the two
velocities is reversible, the drawing leads to a parallelogram. In the parallelogram, it is the
length and direction of the indicated diagonal that solve the problem. In Example 7, accu-
racy is critical in scaling the drawing that represents the problem. Otherwise, the ruler and
protractor will give poor results in your answer.

EXAMPLE 7
An airplane travels due north at 500 kph. If the wind blows at 50 kph from west to
east, what are the resulting speed and direction of the plane? See Figure 4.11 on 
page 175.
SOLUTION Using a ruler to measure the diagonal of the parallelogram, we find that
the length corresponds to a speed of approximately 505 kph. Using a protractor,
we find that the direction is approximately N 
E. 
NOTE: The actual speed is approximately 502.5 kph, while the direction is N

Consider the Discover activity at the left. Through it, we discover conditions that force
a quadrilateral to be a parallelogram. This activity also leads to the following theorem;
proof of the theorem is left to the student.
Another quality of quadrilaterals that determines a parallelogram is found in Theorem
4.2.3. Its proof is also left to the student. 
To understand Theorem 4.2.3, connect vertices A, B, C, and D of Figure 4.13 to 
form quadrilateral ABCD. Now Theorem 4.2.2 can be used to show that ABCD is a 
parallelogram.
When a figure is drawn to represent the hypothesis of a theorem, we should not
include more conditions than the hypothesis states. Relative to Theorem 4.2.3, if we drew
two diagonals that not only bisected each other but also were equal in length, then the
quadrilateral would be the special type of parallelogram known as a rectangle. We will
deal with rectangles in the next section.
THE KITE
The next quadrilateral type that we consider is known as a kite, a quadrilateral that gets its
name from the child’s toy pictured at the left. In the construction of the kite, there are two
pairs of congruent adjacent sides. See Figure 4.14(a) on page 181.

The word distinct is used in the definition of kite to clarify that the kite does not have four
congruent sides. The word adjacent is necessary for the quadrilateral to be a kite; if 
the word adjacent were replaced by the word opposite, the quadrilateral described would
be a parallelogram.
In Example 2, we verify Theorem 4.2.4 by proving that

Reasons
The proof of Theorem 4.2.4 required auxiliary diagonal 
; if drawn, diagonal 
would not determine two congruent triangles—thus, no help!
When observing an old barn or shed, we often see that it has begun to lean. Unlike a
triangle, which is rigid in shape [Figure 4.15(a)] and bends only when broken, a quadrilat-
eral [Figure 4.15(b)] does not provide the same level of strength and stability. In the 
construction of a house, bridge, building, or swing set [Figure 4.15(c)], note the use of
wooden or metal triangles as braces.

Figure 4.20
A rectangle is a parallelogram that has a right angle. (See Figure 4.20.)
DEFINITION
Any reader who is familiar with the rectangle may be confused by the fact that the preced-
ing definition calls for only one right angle. Because a rectangle is a parallelogram by 
definition, the fact that a rectangle has four right angles is easily proved by applying
Corollaries 4.1.3 and 4.1.5; in order, these corollaries remind us that a parallelogram has
“opposite angles that are congruent” and “consecutive angles that are supplementary.” 
The proof of Corollary 4.3.1 is left to the student.
The following theorem is true for rectangles, but not for parallelograms in general.
NOTE: To follow the flow of the proof in Example 1, it may be best to draw triangles
NMQ and PQM of Figure 4.21 on page 188 separately.
COROLLARY 4.3.1
All angles of a rectangle are right angles.
COROLLARY 4.3.2
The diagonals of a rectangle are congruent.
Reminder
A rectangle is a parallelogram. Thus,
it has all the properties of a parallelo-
gram plus some properties of its own.

A square is a rectangle that has two congruent adjacent sides. (See Figure 4.22.)
DEFINITION
COROLLARY 4.3.3
All sides of a square are congruent.
Because a square is a type of rectangle, it has four right angles and its diagonals are con-
gruent. Because a square is also a parallelogram, its opposite sides are parallel. For any
square, we can show that the diagonals are perpendicular; see Exercise 32.
In Chapter 8, we measure area in “square units.” For the calculation of area, we count
the number of congruent squares that fit inside a geometric region.
THE RHOMBUS
The next type of quadrilateral we consider is the rhombus. The plural of the word rhombus
is rhombi (pronounced rho˘m-bi¯).

rhombus ABCD (a type of parallelogram) bisect each other. By SSS, the 
four small triangles are congruent; thus, each angle at vertex E is a right 
angle. Then 
An alternative definition of square is “A square is a rhombus whose adjacent sides
form a right angle.” Therefore, a further property of a square is that its diagonals are 
perpendicular. Because the square and the rhombus are both types of parallelograms, we
have the following consequence.

THE PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM
The Pythagorean Theorem, which deals with right triangles, is also useful in applications
involving quadrilaterals that have right angles. In antiquity, the theorem claimed that 
“the square upon the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares upon the legs of the right
triangle.” See Figure 4.25(a). This interpretation involves the area concept, which we study
in a later chapter. By counting squares in Figure 4.25(a), one sees that 25 “square units” is
the sum of 9 and 16 square units. Our interpretation of the Pythagorean Theorem uses
number (length) relationships.
Figure 4.25
The Pythagorean Theorem will be proved in Section 5.4. Although it was introduced in
Section 3.2, we restate the Pythagorean Theorem for convenience and then review its
application to the right triangle in Example 3. When right angle relationships exist in
quadrilaterals, we often apply the “rule of Pythagoras” as well; see Examples 4, 5, and 6.

The Pythagorean Theorem In a right triangle with hypotenuse of length c and legs of lengths
a and b, it follows that 
.
c2  a2  b2
Provided that the lengths of two of the sides of a right triangle are known, the Pythagorean
Theorem can be applied to determine the length of the third side. In Example 3, we seek
the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle whose lengths of legs are known. When 
we are using the Pythagorean Theorem, c must represent the length of the hypotenuse;
however, either leg can be chosen for length a (or b).
EXAMPLE 3
What is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs measure 6 in. and
8 in.? (See Figure 4.26.)

each right triangle formed by the diagonal.

In Example 5, we apply Corollary 4.3.6, “The diagonals of the rhombus are perpen-

EXAMPLE 5
What is the length of each side of a rhombus whose diagonals measure 10 cm and 
24 cm? (See Figure 4.28.)

When all vertices of a quadrilateral lie on a circle, the quadrilateral is a cyclic quadri-
lateral. As it happens, all rectangles are cyclic quadrilaterals, but no rhombus is a cyclic
quadrilateral. The key factor in determining whether a quadrilateral is cyclic lies in the fact
that the diagonals must intersect at a point that is equidistant from all four vertices. In
Figure 4.30(a), rectangle ABCD is cyclic because A, B, C, and D all lie on the circle.
However, rhombus WXYZ in Figure 4.30(b) is not cyclic because X and Z cannot lie on the
circle when W and Y do lie on the circle.

trapezoid is “trap.” The parallel sides

of trapezoid HJKL are its bases, and the
nonparallel sides

are its legs. Because

Every trapezoid contains two pairs of consecutive interior angles that are supplemen-
tary. Each of these pairs of angles is formed when parallel lines are cut by a transversal. In

are angles L and K. See the “Reminder” at the left.

For completeness, we state two further properties of the isosceles trapezoid.
1. An isosceles trapezoid has line symmetry; this line (or axis) of symmetry is the
perpendicular bisector of either base.
2. An isosceles trapezoid is cyclic; the center of the circle containing all four ver-
tices of the trapezoid is the point of intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of
any two consecutive sides (or of the two legs).

An ancient Chinese puzzle known as a
tangram begins with the specified sep-
aration of a square into seven precise
smaller shapes known as tans. As
shown, the tans are a smaller square,
five right triangles, and a parallelo-
gram. Each puzzle challenges the 
player to rearrange all the tans to form
recognizable two-dimensional shapes:
geometric shapes: a trapezoid, a
rectangle, a parallelogram, etc.
animal shapes: a cat, a rabbit, a
horse, etc.
object shapes: a shoe, a teapot, a
person walking, etc.
In researching (Googling) the tangram,
you may discover this topic and chal-
lenge to be of great personal interest.

SKETCH OF THALES
One of the most significant contributors to the development of
geometry was the Greek mathematician Thales of Miletus
(625–547 B.C.). Thales is credited with being the “Father of
Geometry” because he was the first person to organize geomet-
ric thought and utilize the deductive method as a means of veri-
fying propositions (theorems). It is not surprising that Thales
made original discoveries in geometry. Just as significant as his
discoveries was Thales’ persistence in verifying the claims of his
predecessors. In this textbook, you will find that propositions
such as these are only a portion of those that can be attributed 
to Thales:
Chapter 1: If two straight lines intersect, the opposite
(vertical) angles formed are equal.
Chapter 3: The base angles of an isosceles triangle 
are equal.
Chapter 5: The lengths of the sides of similar triangles 
are proportional.
Chapter 6: An angle inscribed in a semicircle is a 
right angle.
Thales’ knowledge of geometry was matched by the wisdom
that he displayed in everyday affairs. For example, he is known
to have measured the height of the Great Pyramid of Egypt by
comparing the lengths of the shadows cast by the pyramid and
by his own staff. Thales also used his insights into geometry to
measure the distances from the land to ships at sea.
Perhaps the most interesting story concerning Thales was one
related by Aesop (famous for fables). It seems that Thales was on
his way to market with his beasts of burden carrying saddlebags
filled with salt. Quite by accident, one of the mules discovered
that rolling in the stream where he was led to drink greatly
reduced this load; of course, this was due to the dissolving of salt
in the saddlebags. On subsequent trips, the same mule continued
to lighten his load by rolling in the water. Thales soon realized the
need to do something (anything!) to modify the mule’s behavior.
When preparing for the next trip, Thales filled the offensive
mule’s saddlebags with sponges. When the mule took his usual
dive, he found that his load was heavier than ever. Soon the mule
realized the need to keep the saddlebags out of the water. In this
way, it is said that Thales discouraged the mule from allowing the
precious salt to dissolve during later trips to market.

The geometric explanation for this principle utilizes a wrap-
around effect. Study the diagrams in Figure 4.42.
Figure 4.42
Given a unit square (one with sides of length 1), we build a
second square by wrapping 3 unit squares around the first unit
square; in Figure 4.42(b), the “wrap-around” is indicated by 
3 shaded squares. Now for the second square (sides of length 2),
we form the next square by wrapping 5 unit squares around this
square; see Figure 4.42(c).
The next figure in the sequence of squares illustrates that

Where n is a counting number, the sum of the first n
positive odd counting numbers is n2.

A Look Back at Chapter 4
The goal of this chapter has been to develop the properties of
quadrilaterals, including special types of quadrilaterals such as 
the parallelogram, rectangle, and trapezoid. The Overview of
Chapter 4 on page 205 summarizes the properties of quadrilaterals.
A Look Ahead to Chapter 5
In the next chapter, similarity will be defined for all polygons, with
an emphasis on triangles. The Pythagorean Theorem, which we
applied in Chapter 4, will be proved in Chapter 5. Special right 
triangles will be discussed.

In the “wrap-around,” we
emphasize 
that 
the 
next 
number in the sum is an odd
number. The “wrap-around”
approach adds 
, or 
7 unit squares in Figure 4.43.
When building each sequential
square, we always add an odd
number of unit squares as in
Figure 4.43.

Similar Triangles
Talented! The handiwork of a skillful craftsman, these Russian
nesting dolls have the same shape but different sizes. Because of their
design, each doll can be placed within another so that they all nest
together. These painted dolls are said to be similar in shape. In nature,
water lily pads have the same shape but different sizes. In the every-
day world, cylindrical containers found on grocery store shelves may
have the same shape but different sizes. In all these situations, one
figure is merely an enlargement of the other; in geometry, we say 
that two such figures are similar. Further illustrations of both 
two-dimensional and three-dimensional similar figures can be found
in Sections 5.2 and 5.3. The solutions for some applications in this
and later chapters lead to quadratic equations. A review of the 
methods that are used to solve quadratic equations can be found in
Appendix A.4 and Appendix A.5 of this textbook.
Additional video explanations of concepts, sample problems, and applications are
available on DVD.

CHAPTER 5 ■SIMILAR TRIANGLES
Unless otherwise noted, all content on this page is © Cengage Learning.
The concepts and techniques discussed in Section 5.1 are often necessary for managing the
algebraic and geometric applications found in this chapter and beyond.
A ratio is the quotient (where 
) that provides a comparison between the num-
bers a and b. Because every fraction indicates a division, every fraction represents a ratio.
Read “a to b,” the ratio is sometimes written in the form a:b. The numbers a and b are
often called the terms of the ratio.
It is generally preferable to express the ratio in simplified form (lowest terms), so the
ratio 6 to 8 would be reduced (in fraction form) from to . If units of measure are found
in a ratio, these units must be commensurable (convertible to the same unit of measure).
When simplifying the ratio of two quantities that are expressed in the same unit, we 
eliminate the common unit in the process. If two quantities cannot be compared because
no common unit of measure is possible, the quantities are said to be incommensurable.
EXAMPLE 1
Find the simplified form of each ratio:
a) 12 to 20
b) 12 in. to 24 in.
c) 12 in. to 3 ft
(NOTE: 1 ft 
12 in.)
d) 5 lb to 20 oz
(NOTE: 1 lb 
16 oz)
e) 5 lb to 2 ft
f) 4 m to 30 cm
(NOTE: 1 m 
100 cm)
SOLUTION
a)
d)
b)
e)

c)

A rate is a quotient that relates two quantities that are incommensurable. If an auto-
mobile can travel 300 miles along an interstate while consuming 10 gallons of gasoline,
then its consumption rate is 
. In simplified form, the consumption rate is 
,
which is read as “30 miles per gallon” and abbreviated 30 mpg.

A proportion is a statement that equates two ratios or two rates. Thus, 
is a 
proportion and may be read as “a is to b as c is to d.” In the order read, a is the first term
of the proportion, b is the second term, c is the third term, and d is the fourth term. The
first and last terms (a and d) of the proportion are the extremes, whereas the second and
third terms (b and c) are the means.
The following property is extremely convenient for solving proportions.

Because a proportion is a statement, it could be true or false. The truth or falsity of a
proportion can be “tested” by applying the Means-Extremes Property. In the false propor-
tion

In application problems involving proportions, it is essential to order the related quan-
tities in each ratio or rate. The first step in the solution of Example 4 illustrates the care
that must be taken in forming the proportion for an application. Because of consistency,
units may be eliminated in the actual proportion.

PROPERTY OF EXTENDED RATIOS
Unknown quantities in the ratio a:b:c:d can be represented by ax, bx, cx, and dx.
We apply the Property of Extended Ratios in Example 6.
EXAMPLE 6
Suppose that the perimeter of a quadrilateral is 70 and the lengths of the sides are in
the ratio 2:3:4:5. Find the measure of each side.
SOLUTION We represent the lengths of the sides by 2x, 3x, 4x, and 5x. Then
Because 
, 
, 
, and 
, the lengths of the sides of the
quadrilateral are 10, 15, 20, and 25.
It is possible to solve certain problems in more ways than one, as illustrated in the next
example. However, the solution is unique and is not altered by the method chosen.
EXAMPLE 7
The measures of two complementary angles are in the ratio 2 to 3. Find the measure
of each angle.

Using the Means-Extremes Property, we have
Therefore, 
so the angles have measures of 36° and 54°.
ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION Because the measures of the angles are in the ratio 2:3, we
represent their measures by 2x and 3x. Because the angles are complementary,
Now

THE GOLDEN RATIO
It is believed that the “ideal” rectangle is determined when a square can be
removed in such a way as to leave a smaller rectangle with the same shape as
the original rectangle. As we shall find, the rectangles are known as similar in
shape. Upon removal of the square, the similarity in the shapes of the rectangles
requires that 
. To discover the relationship between L and W, we
choose 
and solve the equation 
for L. The solution is 
. The ratio comparing length to width is known as the golden ratio.
Because 
when

is approximately 1.62 times its width; that is,

In this chapter, the discussion of similarity will generally be limited to plane figures.
For two polygons to be similar, it is necessary that each angle of one polygon be con-
gruent to the corresponding angle of the other. However, the congruence of angles is not
sufficient to establish the similarity of polygons. The vertices of the congruent angles are
corresponding vertices of the similar polygons. Consider Figure 5.5. If 
in one poly-
gon is congruent to 
in the second polygon, then vertex A corresponds to vertex H, and
this is symbolized 
; we can indicate that 
corresponds to 
by writing
. A pair of angles like 
and 
are corresponding angles, and the sides
determined by consecutive and corresponding vertices are corresponding sides of the
similar polygons. For instance, if 
and 
, then

.

Given similar quadrilaterals ABCD and HJKL with congruent angles as indicated in

. Similarly,
Associating pairs of consecutive and corresponding vertices of similar polygons,
we determine the endpoints of the corresponding sides.
With an understanding of the terms corresponding angles and corresponding sides, we
can define similar polygons.

The second condition for similarity requires that the following extended proportion
exists for the sides of the similar quadrilaterals of Example 1 on page 218.
Note that both conditions 1 and 2 for similarity are necessary! Although condition 1 of the
definition is satisfied for square EFGH and rectangle RSTU [see Figures 5.6(a) and (b)],
the figures are not similar. That is, one is not an enlargement of the other because the
extended proportion comparing the lengths of corresponding sides is not true. On the other
hand, condition 2 of the definition is satisfied for square EFGH and rhombus WXYZ
[see Figures 5.6(a) and 5.6(c)], but the figures are not similar because the pairs of corre-
sponding angles are not congruent.
Figure 5.6
EXAMPLE 2
Which figures must be similar?
a) Any two isosceles triangles
c) Any two rectangles
b) Any two regular pentagons
d) Any two squares
SOLUTION
a) No; 
pairs need not be
nor do the pairs of sides need to be proportional.
b) Yes; all angles are congruent (measure 
each), and all pairs of sides are
proportional.
c) No; all angles measure 
, but the pairs of sides are not necessarily 
proportional.
d) Yes; all angles measure 
, and all pairs of sides are proportional.

SOLUTION Because the sum of the measures of the angles of a triangle is 180°,
.
Because of the similarity and the correspondence of vertices in Figure 5.7,
.
The proportion that relates the lengths of the sides is
.
From 
, we see that 
and 
.
From 
, we see that 
and 
.
In any proportion, the ratios can all be inverted; thus, Example 3 could have been
solved by using the proportion
In any extended proportion, the ratios must all be equal to the same constant value. By 
designating this number (which is often called the “constant of proportionality”) by k, we
see that
It follows that 
and 
In Example 3, this con-
stant of proportionality has the value 
which means that the length of each side of
the larger triangle was twice the length of the corresponding side of the smaller triangle.
In the following application, the constant of proportionality is the number 4.3.
EXAMPLE 4
For television viewers, there is an ideal relationship between the size of the flat panel
television and the distance at which the viewer watches it. Where D is the diagonal
measure of the television set and V is the distance to the viewer, we express this 
relationship by the proportion 
where the ratio between D and V equals the
constant of proportionality k. Of course, this also leads to the form 
. For 
the following example, it is further noted that flat panel TV sets are commonly 
manufactured with diagonals that measure 19, 22, 26, 32, 37, 42, and 50.
In the following statement, D is measured in inches while V is measured in feet.
While D measures the length of the diagonal of the TV and V the distance from 
the observer to the TV, the ideal relationship is given by 
.
a) Find the ideal distance for a person to watch a TV that has a diagonal 
measuring 37 inches.
b) A shopper intends to purchase an LCD flat panel set that will be viewed 
at a distance of approximately 6 feet. What size set should she purchase?

SOLUTION
a) Using the relationship 
and knowing that 
, we have
. Then 
That is, the viewer would ideally watch 
the TV from a distance of 8.6 feet.
b) With

26 inches.
Let k represent the constant of proportionality for two similar polygons. When 
, 
the similarity produces an enlarged figure known as a stretch or dilation. If 
the similarity produces a smaller figure known as shrink or contraction.
The constant of proportionality is also used to scale a map, a diagram, or a blueprint.
As a consequence, scaling problems can be solved by using proportions.
EXAMPLE 5
On a map, a length of 1 in. represents a distance of 30 mi. On the map, how far apart
should two cities appear if they are actually 140 mi apart along a straight line?
SOLUTION Where 
the map distance desired (in inches),
Then

SOLUTION With

representing the lengths of the congruent segments (
and 
) by x, we have
Substituting into the proportion above, we have
It follows that
Thus, BC equals 4 or 12. Each length is acceptable, but the scaled drawings

The following example uses a method called shadow reckoning. This method of cal-
culating a length dates back more than 2500 years when it was used by the Greek mathe-
matician, Thales, to estimate the height of the pyramids in Egypt. In Figure 5.10,

EXAMPLE 7
Darnell is curious about the height of a flagpole that stands in front of his school.
Darnell, who is 6 ft tall, casts a shadow that he paces off at 9 ft. He walks the length
of the shadow of the flagpole, a distance of 30 ft. How tall is the flagpole?

It is quite difficult to establish a proportionality between the lengths of the corresponding
sides of polygons. For this reason, our definition of similar polygons (and therefore of sim-
ilar triangles) is almost impossible to use as a method of proof. Fortunately, some easier
methods for proving triangles similar are available. If two triangles are carefully sketched
or constructed so that pairs of angles are congruent, the triangles will have the same shape
as shown in Figure 5.11.

If the three angles of one triangle are congruent to the three angles of a second triangle,
then the triangles are similar (AAA).
POSTULATE 15
Corollary 5.3.1 of Postulate 15 follows from Corollary 2.4.4, which states “If two angles
of one triangle are congruent to two angles of another triangle, then the third pair of angles
must also be congruent.” 
COROLLARY 5.3.1
If two angles of one triangle are congruent to two angles of another triangle, then the tri-
angles are similar (AA).

In some instances, we wish to prove a relationship that takes us beyond the similarity
of triangles. The following consequences of the definition of similarity are often cited as
reasons in a proof. 
EXS. 1–4
Corresponding sides of similar triangles are proportional.
CSSTP
Corresponding angles of similar triangles are congruent.
CASTC
The first fact, abbreviated CSSTP, is used in Example 2. Although the CSSTP 
statement involves triangles, the corresponding sides of any two similar polygons are 
proportional. That is, the ratio of the lengths of any pair of corresponding sides of 
one polygon equals the ratio of the lengths of another pair of corresponding sides of the
second polygon. The second fact, abbreviated CASTC, is used in Example 4.

THEOREM 5.3.2
The lengths of the corresponding altitudes of similar triangles have the same ratio as the
lengths of any pair of corresponding sides.
The proof of Theorem 5.3.2 is left to the student; see Exercise 35. Note that this proof also
requires the use of CSSTP.
The paragraph style of proof is generally used in upper-level mathematics classes. These
paragraph proofs are no more than modified two-column proofs. Compare the following

angles are congruent. Now

NOTE: In the proof, the sides selected for the proportion were carefully chosen. 
The statement to be proved required that we include NP, QR, RP, and MN in 
the proportion.
In addition to AA, there are other methods that can be used to establish similar trian-
gles. Recall that SAS and SSS name methods for proving that triangles are congruent. To
distinguish the following techniques for showing that triangles are similar from the 
methods for proving that triangles are congruent, we use 
and 
to identify
the similarity theorems. We will prove 
in Example 6, but the proof of

THEOREM 5.3.3 (SAS
)

If an angle of one triangle is congruent to an angle of a second triangle and the pairs of
sides including the angles are proportional, then the triangles are similar.
THEOREM 5.3.4 (SSS
)

If the three sides of one triangle are proportional to the three corresponding sides of a
second triangle, then the triangles are similar.
Consider this application of Theorem 5.3.3.

THEOREM 5.4.1
The altitude drawn to the hypotenuse of a right triangle separates the right triangle into
two right triangles that are similar to each other and to the original right triangle.
THEOREM 5.4.2
The length of the altitude to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is the geometric mean of
the lengths of the segments of the hypotenuse.
Theorem 5.4.1 is illustrated by Figure 5.18, in which the right triangle 
has its right
angle at vertex C so that 
is the altitude to hypotenuse 
. The smaller triangles are
shown in Figures 5.18(b) and (c), and the original triangle is shown in Figure 5.18(d). Note
the matching arcs indicating congruent angles.

Chinese were aware of the relationship before the time of Pythagoras.

SOLUTION Applying the Pythagorean Theorem, the desired height h is the length of
a leg of the indicated right triangle.
The height is exactly 
, which is approximately 11.31 ft.
EXAMPLE 4
One diagonal of a rhombus has the same length, 10 cm, as each side of the rhombus
in Figure 5.26. How long is the other diagonal?
SOLUTION Because the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other, four
right 
s are formed. For each right 
, a side of the rhombus is the hypotenuse.
Half of the length of each diagonal is the length of a leg of each right triangle.
Therefore,
Thus, the length of the whole diagonal is 
or 
The solution for Example 5 also depends upon the Pythagorean Theorem, but it 
is slightly more demanding than the solution for Example 4. Indeed, it is one of those 
situations that may require some insight to solve. Note that the triangle described in

the lengths of their sides, as found in Theorem 5.4.7 on page 239.

Three sets of Pythagorean triples encountered in this section are (3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), and
(8, 15, 17). These combinations of numbers, as lengths of sides, always lead to a right 
triangle.
Natural-number multiples of any of these triples also produce Pythagorean triples. 
For example, doubling (3, 4, 5) yields (6, 8, 10), which is also a Pythagorean triple; in
Figure 5.29, the two triangles are similar by SSS
.
The Pythagorean triple (3, 4, 5) also leads to the multiples (9, 12, 15), (12, 16, 20),
and (15, 20, 25). The Pythagorean triple (5, 12, 13) leads to triples such as (10, 24, 26) 
and (15, 36, 39). Basic Pythagorean triples that are encountered less frequently include 
(7, 24, 25), (9, 40, 41), and (20, 21, 29).
Pythagorean triples can be generated by using select formulas. Where p and q are 
natural numbers and 
, one formula uses 2pq for the length of one leg, 
for
the length of other leg, and 
for the length of the hypotenuse (See Figure 5.30.).
Table 5.1 lists some Pythagorean triples corresponding to choices for p and q. The
triples printed in boldface type are basic triples, also known as primitive triples; the entries
a, b, and c of a primitive triple have only the common factor 1. In applications, knowledge
of the primitive triples and their multiples will save you considerable time and effort. In
the final column of Table 5.1, the resulting triple is provided in the order from a (small) to
c (large).

THE CONVERSE OF THE PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM
The Converse of the Pythagorean Theorem (Theorem 5.4.5) allows us to recognize a right
triangle by knowing the lengths of its sides. A variation on this converse allows us to deter-
mine whether a triangle is acute or obtuse. This theorem is stated without proof.
THEOREM 5.4.7
Let a, b, and c represent the lengths of the three sides of a triangle, with c the length of
the longest side.
1. If 
, then the triangle is obtuse and the obtuse angle lies opposite
the side of length c.
2. If 
, then the triangle is acute.

Many of the calculations that we do in this section involve square root radicals. To under-
stand some of these calculations better, it may be necessary to review the Properties of
Square Roots in Appendix A.5.
Certain right triangles occur so often that they deserve more attention than others. The
two special right triangles that we consider in this section have angle measures of 
, 
, 
and 
or of
, 
, and 
.
THE 45°-45°-90° RIGHT TRIANGLE
In the 45º-45º-90º triangle, the legs lie opposite the congruent angles and are also congru-
ent. Rather than using a and b to represent the lengths of the legs, we use a for both
lengths; see Figure 5.31. By the Pythagorean Theorem, it follows that

THEOREM 5.5.1 ■45-45-90 Theorem
In a right triangle whose angles measure 45°, 45°, and 90°, the legs are congruent and
the hypotenuse has a length equal to the product of 
and the length of either leg.
2
It is better to memorize the sketch in Figure 5.32 than to repeat the steps of the “proof”
that precedes the 45-45-90 Theorem. The boxed information that follows summarizes the
facts shown in Figure 5.32.

SOLUTION
a) The length of hypotenuse 
is 
, the product of 
and the length of
either of the equal legs.
b) Let a denote the length of 
and of 
. The length of hypotenuse 
is
.
Then 
, so 
. Simplifying yields
Therefore, 
NOTE: If we use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve Example 1, the solution in part (a)

GIVEN: The right triangle with lengths of sides a, a, and 
(See Figure 5.39).
PROVE: The triangle is a 45°-45°-90° triangle
PROOF
In Figure 5.39, the length of the hypotenuse is 
, where a is the
length of either leg. In a right triangle, the angles that lie opposite the
congruent legs are also congruent. In a right triangle, the acute angles are
complementary, so each of the congruent acute angles measures 45°.
EXAMPLE 6
In right 
, 
in Figure 5.40. What are the measures of the angles of the
triangle? If 
, what is the length of 
(or 
)?
Figure 5.40
SOLUTION The longest side is the hypotenuse 
, so the right angle is 
and
. Because 
, the congruent acute angles are 
R and T and
. Because 
, 
.
The converse of Theorem 5.5.2 is also true and can be proved by the indirect method.
Rather than construct the proof, we state and apply this theorem. See Figure 5.41.

A jogger runs along two sides of an open rectangular lot. 
If the first side of the lot is 200 ft long and the diagonal 
distance across the lot is 400 ft, what is the measure of 
the angle formed by the 200-ft and 400-ft dimensions? To
the nearest foot, how much farther does the jogger run by
traveling the two sides of the block rather than the diagonal
distance across the lot?

Exercises 35, 36
In this section, we begin with an informal description of the phrase divided proportion-
ally. Suppose that three children have been provided with a joint savings account by their
parents. Equal monthly deposits have been made to the account for each child since birth.
If the ages of the children are 2, 4, and 6 (assume exactness of ages for simplicity) and the
total in the account is $7200, then the amount that each child should receive can be found
by solving the equation
Solving this equation leads to the solution $1200 for the 2-year-old, $2400 for the 4-year-
old, and $3600 for the 6-year-old. We say that the amount has been divided proportion-
ally. Expressed as a proportion that compares the amount saved to age, we have

CHAPTER 5 ■SIMILAR TRIANGLES
CEVA’S PROOF
Giovanni Ceva (1647–1736) was the Italian mathematician for
whom Ceva’s Theorem is named. Although his theorem is diffi-
cult to believe, its proof is not lengthy. The proof follows.
Theorem 5.6.4 E (Ceva’s Theorem)
Figure 5.55
PROOF
Given 
with interior point D [see Figure 5.55(a)], draw a
line 
through point C that is parallel to 
. Now extend 
to
meet at point R. Likewise, extend 
to meet at point S. See
Figure 5.55(b). Using similar triangles, we will be able to 
substitute desired ratios into the statement
,
obviously true because each numerator has a matching denomi-
nator. Because 
by AA, we have 
Also with 
, we have 
. By the 
Transitive Property of Equality, 
and by interchanging 
the means, we see that 
[The first ratio, 
of this pro-
portion will replace the ratio 
in the starred (*) statement.]
From the fact that

[The second
ratio, 
of this proportion will replace the ratio

AN UNUSUAL APPLICATION 
OF SIMILAR TRIANGLES
The following problem is one that can be solved in many ways.
If methods of calculus are applied, the solution is found through
many complicated and tedious calculations. The simplest solu-
tion, which follows, utilizes geometry and similar triangles.
Problem: A hiker is at a location 450 ft downstream from his
campsite. He is 200 ft away from the straight stream, and his tent
is 100 ft away, as shown in Figure 5.56(a). Across the flat field,
he sees that a spark from his campfire has ignited the tent.
Taking the empty bucket he is carrying, he runs to the river to get
water and then on to the tent. To what point on the river should
he run to minimize the distance he travels?

■Summary
259
A Look Back at Chapter 5
One goal of this chapter has been to define similarity for two 
polygons. We postulated a method for proving triangles similar and
showed that proportions are a consequence of similar triangles, a
line parallel to one side of a triangle, and a ray bisecting one angle
of a triangle. The Pythagorean Theorem and its converse were
proved. We discussed the 30 -60 -90
triangle, the 45 -45 -90
triangle, and other special right triangles whose lengths of sides
determine Pythagorean triples. The final section developed the 
concept known as “segments divided proportionally.”
A Look Ahead to Chapter 6
In the next chapter, we will begin our work with the circle.
Segments and lines of the circle will be defined, as will special
angles in a circle. Several theorems dealing with the measurements
of these angles and line segments will be proved. Our work with
constructions will enable us to deal with the locus of points and the
concurrence of lines that are found in Chapter 7.

Summary
We wish to determine x in Figure 5.56(b) on page 258 so that
the total distance 
is as small as possible.
Consider three possible choices of this point on the river. These
are suggested by dashed, dotted, and solid lines in Figure
5.57(a). Also consider the reflections of the triangles across the
river. [See Figure 5.57(b).]
Figure 5.57
The minimum distance D occurs where the segments of
lengths 
and 
form a straight line. That is, the configuration
with the solid line segments minimizes the distance. In that case,
the triangle at left and the reflected triangle at right are similar,
as shown in Figure 5.58.
Figure 5.58
Thus
Accordingly, the desired point on the river is 300 ft (determined
by 
) upstream from the hiker’s location.

Circles
Towering! Displayed in the design of the Jardine House in Hong
Kong are numerous windows that take the shape of circles. Circles
appear everywhere in the real world, from the functional gear or 
pulley to the edible pancake. In this chapter, we will deal with the 
circle, related terminology, and properties. Based upon earlier 
principles, the theorems of this chapter follow logically from the
properties found in previous chapters. There are numerous applica-
tions of the circle found in the examples and the exercises of this
chapter. Another look at the Jardine House reveals that the circle 
has contemporary applications as well.
Additional video explanations of concepts, sample problems, and applications are
available on DVD.

CHAPTER 6 ■CIRCLES

In this chapter, we will expand the terminology for circles that was found in Section 1.2.
We also introduce some methods of measurement of arcs and angles and develop many
properties of the circle.
A circle is named by its center point. In Figure 6.1, point P is the center of the circle.
The symbol for circle is 
, so the circle in Figure 6.1 is 
. Points A, B, C, and D are
points of (or on) the circle. Points P (the center) and R are in the interior of circle P; points
G and H are in the exterior of the circle.
In 
of Figure 6.2, 
is a radius of the circle. A radius is a segment that joins the
center of the circle to a point on the circle.

A line segment (such as

points of a circle is a chord of the circle. A diameter of a
circle is a chord that contains the center of the circle; if T-Q-W

ANGLE AND ARC RELATIONSHIPS IN THE CIRCLE
In Figure 6.8, the sum of the measures of the angles about point O (angles determined by
perpendicular diameters 
and 
) is 360°. Similarly, the circle can be separated 
into 360 equal arcs, each of which measures 1° of arc measure; that is, each arc would be
intercepted by a central angle measuring 1°. Our description of arc measure leads to the
following postulate.

In a circle or congruent circles, congruent arcs are arcs with equal measures.
DEFINITION
To further clarify the definition of congruent arcs, consider
the concentric circles (having the same center) in Figure 6.10.
Here the degree measure of 
of the smaller circle is the
same as the degree measure of 
of the larger circle.
Even though 
, we conclude that 
because the arcs would not coincide.

When 
as in Figure 6.12(a), we say that point B is between A and
C of circle O.
Given points A, B, and C on 
as shown in Figure 6.12(a), suppose that radii 
,
, and 
are drawn. Just as 
by the Angle-
Addition Postulate, it follows that
.
In the statement of the Arc-Addition Postulate, the reason for writing 
(rather than 
)
is that the arc with endpoints at A and C could be a major arc. 
Figure 6.12
The Arc-Addition Postulate can easily be extended to include more than two arcs. In
Figure 6.12(b), 
(or 
because 
is a minor 
arc). If 
, then point S is the midpoint of 
; alternately, 
is bisected at
point S.
In Example 4, we use the fact that the entire circle measures 360°.
EXAMPLE 4
In Figure 6.13, determine the measure of the angle formed by the hands of a clock at
3:12 P.M.
SOLUTION The minute hand moves through 12 minutes, which is 
or of an hour.
Thus, the minute hand points in a direction whose angle measure from the 
vertical is 
or 72°. At exactly 3 P.M., the hour hand would form an angle 
of 90° with the vertical. However, gears inside the clock also turn the hour hand 
through of the 30° arc from the 3 toward the 4; that is, the hour hand moves 
another 
or 6° to form an angle of 96° with the vertical. At 3:12 P.M., the
angle between the hands must measure 
or 24°.
The measure of an arc of a circle can be used to measure the corresponding 
central angle. The measure of an arc can also be used to measure an inscribed angle, which
is defined as follows.

An inscribed angle of a circle is an angle whose vertex is a point on the circle and whose
sides are chords of the circle.
DEFINITION
In Figure 6.14, 
is an inscribed angle. Note that the word inscribed is often 
associated with the word inside. As suggested by the Discover activity at the left, the 
relationship between the measure of an inscribed angle and its intercepted arc leads to 
the following theorem.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

The proof of Theorem 6.1.2 must be divided into three cases:
CASE 1. One side of the inscribed angle is a diameter. See Figure 6.16.
CASE 2.
The diameter through the vertex of the inscribed angle lies in the interior
of the angle. See Figure 6.15(a).
CASE 3. The diameter through the vertex of the inscribed angle lies in the exterior
of the angle. See Figure 6.15(b).
Figure 6.15
The proof of Case 1 follows, but proofs of the other cases are left as exercises.
GIVEN:
with inscribed 
and diameter 
(See Figure 6.16.)
PROVE:
PROOF OF CASE 1: We begin by drawing auxilary radius 
. Then
because the central angle has a measure equal to the measure
of its intercepted arc. With 
, 
is isosceles and 
.
Now the exterior angle of the triangle is 
, so 
.
Because 
, 
. Then 
. With 
, we have 
by substitution.
Although proofs in this chapter generally take the less formal paragraph form, it
remains necessary to be able to justify each statement of the proof.

We suggest that the student make drawings to illustrate Theorems 6.1.4–6.1.6. Some of the
proofs require the use of auxiliary radii.
In Theorems 6.1.5 and 6.1.6, the related chords and arcs share the same endpoints.
On the basis of an earlier definition, we define the distance from the center of a circle
to a chord to be the length of the perpendicular segment joining the center to that chord.
Congruent triangles are used to prove Theorems 6.1.7 and 6.1.8.

A tangent is a line that intersects a circle at exactly one point; the point of intersection
is the point of contact, or point of tangency.
DEFINITION
The term tangent also applies to a line segment or ray that is part of a tangent line to a cir-
cle. In each case, the tangent touches the circle at one point.
A secant is a line (or segment or ray) that intersects a circle at exactly two points.

arc. Now we consider another type of angle found within the circle.

Recall that a circle separates points in the plane into three sets: points in the interior
of the circle, points on the circle, and points in the exterior of the circle. In Figure 6.26,
point A and center O are in the interior of 
because their distances from center O are
less than the length of the radius. Point B is on the circle, but points C and D are in the
exterior of 
because their distances from O are greater than the length of the radius.
(See Exercise 46.) In the proof of Theorem 6.2.3, we use the fact that a tangent to a circle
cannot contain an interior point of the circle.

THEOREM 6.2.3
The radius (or any other line through the center of a circle) drawn to a tangent at the point
of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent at that point.
GIVEN:
with tangent 
; point B is the point of tangency (See Figure 6.27.)
PROVE:
PROOF:
is tangent to 
at point B. Let C name any point on 
except
point B. Now 
because C lies in the exterior of the circle. It follows
that 
because the shortest distance from a point to a line is determined
by the perpendicular segment from that point to the line.
The following example illustrates an application of Theorem 6.2.3.
EXAMPLE 2
A manned NASA shuttle going to the moon has reached 
a position that is 5 mi above its surface. If the radius of 
the moon is 1080 mi, how far to the horizon can the crew 
members see? See Figure 6.28.
SOLUTION According to Theorem 6.2.3, the tangent 
determining the line of sight and the radius of the 
moon form a right angle. In the right triangle 
determined, let t represent the desired distance. 
Using the Pythagorean Theorem,
A consequence of Theorem 6.2.3 is Corollary 6.2.4, which has three possible cases.
In Case 1, we consider the measure of an angle formed by a tangent and the diameter
drawn to the point of contact. Illustrated in Figure 6.29, only the first case is proved; proofs
of the remaining two cases are left as exercises for the student in Exercises 44 and 45.

If an angle is formed by a secant and a tangent that intersect in the exterior of a circle, then
the measure of the angle is one-half the difference of the measures of its intercepted arcs.
In Figure 6.33, 
according to Theorem 6.2.6. Again, we 
must subtract the measure of the smaller arc from the measure of the larger arc. A quick
study of the figures that illustrate Theorems 6.2.5–6.2.7 shows that the smaller 
intercepted arc is “nearer” the vertex of the angle and that the larger intercepted arc is 
“farther from” the vertex of the angle.

CIRCLES THAT ARE TANGENT
In this section, we assume that two circles are coplanar. Although concentric circles do not
intersect, they do share a common center. For the concentric circles shown in Figure 6.41,
the tangent of the smaller circle is a chord of the larger circle.
If two circles touch at one point, they are tangent circles. In Figure 6.42(a), circles P
and Q are internally tangent; in Figure 6.42(b), circles O and R are externally tangent.

COMMON TANGENT LINES TO CIRCLES
A line, line segment, or ray that is tangent to each of two circles is a common tangent
for these circles. If the common tangent does not intersect the line segment joining the 
centers, it is a common external tangent. In Figure 6.44(a), circles P and Q have one
common external tangent,

In Exercises 44 to 47, prove the stated theorem.

If a line is drawn through the center of a circle perpendicu-
lar to a chord, then it bisects the chord and its minor arc.
See Figure 6.37 on page 288.
(NOTE: The major arc is also bisected by the line.)
45.
If a line through the center of a circle bisects a chord other
than a diameter, then it is perpendicular to the chord. See
Figure 6.38 on page 289.

If two secant segments are drawn to a circle from an exter-

If a tangent segment and a secant segment are drawn to a
circle from an external point, then the square of the length
of the tangent equals the product of the length of the secant
with the length of its external segment. See Figure 6.52 on

given line at a point on that line.

THEOREM 6.4.1
The line that is perpendicular to the radius of a circle at its endpoint on the circle is a 
tangent to the circle.

GIVEN: In Figure 6.54(a),

PROVE:
is a tangent to 
at point T
PROOF: Suppose that 
is not a tangent to 
at T. Then the tangent (call it 
)
can be drawn at T, the point of tangency. [See Figure 6.54(b).]
Now 
is the radius to tangent 
at T, and because a radius drawn to 
a tangent at the point of contact of the tangent is perpendicular to the tangent,
. But 
by hypothesis. Thus, two lines are perpendicular to 
at point T, contradicting the fact that there is only one line perpendicular to a line
at a point on the line. Therefore, the supposition is false and 
must be the 
tangent to 
at point T.
CONSTRUCTIONS OF TANGENTS TO CIRCLES
To construct a tangent to a circle at a point on the circle.
GIVEN:
with point X on the circle [See Figure 6.55(a).]
CONSTRUCT: A tangent

To construct a tangent to a circle from an external point.
GIVEN:
and external point E [See Figure 6.56(a).]

Figure 6.56(c): With M as center and MQ (or ME) as the length of radius, 
construct a circle. The points of intersection of circle M with circle Q are 
designated by T and V. Now draw

NOTE: If drawn, 
would also be a tangent to

.
In the preceding construction, 
(not shown) is a radius of the smaller circle Q. In the
larger circle M, 
is an inscribed angle that intercepts a semicircle. Thus, 
is a
right angle and 
. Because the line (
) drawn perpendicular to the radius (
) of
a circle at its endpoint on the circle is a tangent to the circle, 
is a tangent to circle Q.

THEOREM 6.4.4
In a circle (or in congruent circles) containing two unequal chords, the shorter chord is
at the greater distance from the center of the circle.
THEOREM 6.4.5
In a circle (or in congruent circles) containing two unequal chords, the chord nearer the
center of the circle has the greater length.
We apply Theorem 6.4.4 in Example 3.
EXAMPLE 3
In circle P of Figure 6.59, the radius length is 6 cm, and the chords have lengths

name 
perpendicular segments to these chords from center P.
a) Of

SOLUTION
a)

CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE EARTH
By traveling around the earth at the equator, one would traverse
the circumference of the earth. Early mathematicians attempted
to discover the numerical circumference of the earth. But the
best approximation of the circumference was due to the work of
the Greek mathematician Eratosthenes (276–194 B.C.). In his
day, Eratosthenes held the highly regarded post as the head of
the museum at the university in Alexandria.
What Eratosthenes did to calculate the earth’s circumference
was based upon several assumptions. With the sun at a great dis-
tance from the earth, its rays would be parallel as they struck the
earth. Because of parallel lines, the alternate interior angles
shown in the diagram would have the same measure (indicated
by the Greek letter a). In Eratosthenes’ plan, an angle measure-
ment in Alexandria would be determined when the sun was
directly over the city of Syene. While the angle suggested at the
center of the earth could not be measured, the angle (in
Alexandria) formed by the vertical and the related shadow could
be measured; in fact, the measure was a
.
Eratosthenes’ solution to the problem was based upon 
this fact: The ratio comparing angle measures is equivalent
to the ratio comparing land distances. The distance between
Syene and Alexandria was approximately 5,000 stadia 
Figure 6.62
(1 stadium
516.73 ft). Where C is the circumference of the
earth in stadia, this leads to the proportion
Solving the proportion and converting to miles, Eratosthenes’
approximation of the earth’s circumference was about 24,662 mi,
which is about 245 mi less than the actual circumference.
Eratosthenes, a tireless student and teacher, lost his sight late
in life. Unable to bear his loss of sight and lack of productivity,
Eratosthenes committed suicide by refusing to eat.

A Look Back at Chapter 6
One goal in this chapter has been to classify angles inside, on, and
outside the circle. Formulas for finding the measures of these
angles were developed. Line and line segments related to a circle
were defined, and some ways of finding the measures of these 
segments were described. Theorems involving inequalities in a 
circle were proved. Some constructions that led to tangents of 
circles were considered.
A Look Ahead to Chapter 7
One goal of Chapter 7 is the study of loci (plural of locus), which
has to do with point location. In fact, a locus of points is often noth-
ing more than the description of some well-known geometric 
figure. Knowledge of locus leads to the determination of whether
certain lines must be concurrent (meet at a common point). Finally,
we will extend the notion of concurrence to develop further 
properties and terminology for regular polygons.

PERSPECTIVE ON APPLICATIONS
SUM OF INTERIOR ANGLES OF A POLYGON
Suppose that we had studied the circle before studying polygons.
Our methods of proof and justifications would be greatly 
affected. In particular, suppose that you do not know the sum of
the measures of the interior angles of a triangle is 
but you
do know these facts:
1. The sum of the arc measures of a circle is 
.
2. The measure of an inscribed angle of a circle is 
the measure of its intercepted arc.
Using these facts, we prove “The sum of the measures of the
interior angles of a triangle is 
.”
Proof: In 
, 
, 
, 
and 
. Then 
Using known facts 1 and 2, we can also
show that “The sum of the measures of the
interior angles of a quadrilateral is 
.”
However, we would complete our proof 
by utilizing a cyclic quadrilateral. The
strategic ordering and association of terms
leads to the desired result.
Proof: For quadrilateral HJKL in Figure 6.64,
or
360
By the Transitive Property,
360
We could continue in this manner to show that the sum of the
measures of the five interior angles of a pentagon (using a cyclic
pentagon) is 540° and that the sum of the measures of the n
interior angles of a cyclic polygon of n sides is 
.

Gorgeous! Not only are the gardens at the Chateau de Villandry in
France beautiful, but the layout of the garden also demonstrates the
importance of location in this design. At the core of this chapter is the
notion of locus, a Latin term that means “location.” In the symmetry
of the garden, each flower or shrub has a counterpart located on the
opposite side of (and at the same distance from) the central path. 
The notion of locus provides the background necessary to develop
properties for the concurrence of lines as well as further properties 
of regular polygons.

CHAPTER 7 ■LOCUS AND CONCURRENCE
Unless otherwise noted, all content on this page is © Cengage Learning.
In some instances, we describe the set of points whose locations satisfy a given condition
or set of conditions. The term used to describe the resulting geometric figure is locus
(pronounced l¯o-k˘us), the plural of which is loci (pronounced l¯o-s¯i). The English word
location is derived from the Latin word locus.
In this definition, the phrase “all points and only those points” has a dual meaning:
1. All points of the locus satisfy the given condition.
2. All points satisfying the given condition are included in the locus.
The set of points satisfying a given locus can be a well-known geometric figure such as a
line or a circle. In Examples 1, 2, and 3, several points are located in a plane and then con-
nected in order to form the locus.
EXAMPLE 1
Describe the locus of points in a plane that are at a fixed distance (r) from a given
point (P).
SOLUTION See Figure 7.1. Each point shown in red is the same distance r from 
point P. Thus, the locus of points at fixed distance r from point P is the circle
with center P and radius length r.
EXAMPLE 2
Describe the locus of points in a plane that are 
equidistant from two fixed points (P and Q).
SOLUTION See Figure 7.2. Each point shown in red 
is located the same distance from point P as it is
from point Q. For instance, if 
and 
were
drawn, then 
. The locus of points in 
the plane that are equidistant from P and Q is the
perpendicular bisector of 
.

EXAMPLE 3
Describe the locus of points in a plane that are 
equidistant from the sides of an angle 
in that plane.
SOLUTION In Figure 7.3, each point shown in red 
is the same distance from

For instance, 
. Thus, the locus of 
points equidistant from the sides of

) that bisects

Figure 7.3
A circle is the locus of points in a plane that are at a fixed distance from a given point.
DEFINITION
Each of the preceding examples includes the phrase “in a plane.” If that phrase is omit-
ted, the locus is found “in space.” For instance, the locus of points that are at a fixed
distance from a given point is actually a sphere (the three-dimensional object in 
Figure 7.4); the sphere has the fixed point as center, and the fixed distance determines the
length of the radius. Unless otherwise stated, we will consider the locus to be restricted to
a plane.
EXAMPLE 4
Describe the locus of points in space that are equidistant from two parallel planes
(P and Q).
SOLUTION See Figure 7.5. Where plane P
plane Q, the points in red are the same
distance from plane P as from plane Q. The locus is the plane parallel to each of
the given planes and midway between them. 
Following are two very important theorems involving the locus concept. The results
of these two theorems will be used in Section 7.2. When we verify the locus theorems, we
must establish two results:
1. If a point is in the locus, then it satisfies the condition.
2. If a point satisfies the condition, then it is a point of the locus.

THEOREM 7.1.1
The locus of points in a plane and equidistant from the sides of an angle is the angle
bisector.
PROOF
(Note that both parts i and ii are necessary.)
i) If a point is on the angle bisector, then it is equidistant from the sides of 
the angle.

We now return to further considerations of a locus in a plane.
Suppose that a given line segment is to be used as the hypotenuse of a right triangle.
How might one locate possible positions for the vertex of the right angle? One method
might be to draw 30° and 60° angles at the endpoints so that the remaining angle formed
must measure 90° [see Figure 7.9(a)]. This is only one possibility, but because of symme-
try, it actually provides four permissible points, which are indicated in Figure 7.9(b). This
problem is completed in Example 5.
Figure 7.9
EXAMPLE 5
Find the locus of the vertex of the right angle of a right triangle if the hypotenuse is
in Figure 7.10(a).
SOLUTION Rather than using a “hit or miss” approach for locating the possible 
vertices (as suggested in the paragraph preceding this example), recall that an
angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle. Thus, we construct the circle
whose center is the midpoint M of the hypotenuse and whose radius equals 
one-half the length of the hypotenuse. 
Figure 7.10(b): First, the midpoint M of the hypotenuse 
is located.

The locus of the vertex of the right angle of a right triangle whose hypotenuse 
is given is the circle whose center is at the midpoint of the given segment and
whose radius is equal in length to half the length of the given segment. Every
point (except A and B) on 
is the vertex of a right triangle with hypotenuse
; see Theorem 6.1.9.
In Example 5, the construction involves locating the midpoint M of 
; the midpoint
is found by constructing the perpendicular bisector of 
. The compass is then opened to
a radius whose length is MA or MB, and the circle is drawn. 
When a construction is performed, it falls into one of two categories:
1. A basic construction method
2. A compound construction problem that may require several steps and may
involve several basic construction methods 
The next example falls into category 2.
Recall that the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular and also bisect each other.
With this information, we can locate the vertices of the rhombus whose diagonals (lengths)
are known.
EXAMPLE 6
Construct rhombus ABCD given its diagonals 
and 
. (See Figure 7.11(a).)
SOLUTION Figure 7.11(a): To begin, we construct the perpendicular bisector of 
;
we know that the remaining vertices B and D must lie on this line. As shown, 
M is the midpoint of 
.
Figure 7.11(b): To locate the midpoint of 
, we construct its perpendicular
bisector as well. The midpoint of 
is also the midpoint of 
.

In this definition, the fixed point is known as the focus of the parabola while the fixed
line is the directrix of the parabola. In the following description, we will indicate points
that lie on the directrix by 
, 
, and so on. Using this subscripted notation, we also indi-
cate points that are on the parabola by 
, 
, and so on. Subscripted notation will also be
useful in the formulas of Chapters 8, 9, 10, and 11. For the moment, think of 
as “the
third point located on directrix d.”
Consider Figure 7.12(a), in which the indicated directrix d (a line) and the focus F
(a point) are shown. In Figure 7.12(b), each point of the locus is equidistant from the line
d (the directrix) and point F (the focus). In symbols, 
and so on. Point 
, the midpoint of the perpendicular line segment from
focus F to directrix d, is the vertex of the parabola. Also, the line through F that is perpen-
dicular to d is known as the axis of symmetry for the parabola; that is, each point on one
side of the axis has a mirror image on the opposite side of the axis. Line segments that
measure distances from 
to 
from 
to 
from 
to 
, and so on, are always mea-
sured along a perpendicular line segment to the directrix d. The line segments that join
mirror images of the parabola (such as 
and 
) are perpendicular to the axis of sym-
metry. In Figure 7.12, the parabola is shown in black.
Figure 7.12
Many parabolas are drawn or constructed on a grid system (like the Cartesian system
that we will study in Chapter 10). In such a system, it is fairly easy to draw lines parallel
to the directrix and also easy to measure distances from the focus.
EXAMPLE 7 
Sketch the parabola that has focus F and directrix d, as shown in Figure 7.13(a) on
page 316.

the light source in such a way as to brighten and expand the illuminated path of the 
vehicle. See illustrations below.

not concurrent even though any pair of lines (such as r and s) do intersect.

Figure 7.16
By the Transitive Property of Congruence, it follows that 
. Because 
the bisector of an angle is the locus of points equidistant from the sides of the
angle, E is also on the bisector of the third angle, 
. Thus, the three angle
bisectors are concurrent at point E.
The point E at which the angle bisectors meet in Example 1 is the incenter of the 
triangle. In Example 1, we saw that 
. As the following example shows,
the term incenter is well deserved because this point is the center of the inscribed circle of
the triangle.
EXAMPLE 2
Complete the construction of the inscribed circle for 
in Figure 7.16(b).
SOLUTION Having found the incenter E, we need the length of the radius. Because
(as shown in Figure 7.17), the length of 
(or 
or 
) is the
desired radius; thus, the circle is completed.
NOTE: The sides of the triangle are tangents for the inscribed circle known as the 
incircle of the triangle. The incircle lies inside the triangle.
It is also possible to circumscribe a circle about a given triangle. The construction
depends on the following theorem, the proof of which is sketched in Example 3.

Figure 7.18
In Figure 7.18, the point at which the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle
meet is the circumcenter F of the triangle. In Example 3, we see that 
.
The term circumcenter is easily remembered as the center of the circumscribed circle.
EXAMPLE 4
Complete the construction of the circumscribed circle for 
that was given in
Figure 7.18(a).
SOLUTION We have already identified the center of the circle as point F. To complete
the construction, we use F as the center and a radius of length equal to the 
distance from F to any one of the vertices A, B, or C. The circumscribed circle 
is shown above in Figure 7.18(b).
NOTE: The sides of the inscribed triangle are chords of the circumscribed circle, which is
called the circumcircle of the triangle. The circumcircle of a polygon lies outside the
polygon except where it contains the vertices of the polygon.
The incenter and the circumcenter of a triangle are generally distinct points. However,
it is possible for the two centers to coincide in a special type of triangle. Although the
incenter of a triangle always lies in the interior of the triangle, the circumcenter of an
obtuse triangle will lie in the exterior of the triangle. See Figure 7.19.
To complete the discussion of concurrence, we include a theorem involving the
altitudes of a triangle and a theorem involving the medians of a triangle.

THEOREM 7.2.3
The three altitudes of a triangle are concurrent.
The point of concurrence for the three altitudes of a triangle is the orthocenter of the
triangle. In Figure 7.20(a), point N is the orthocenter of 
. For the obtuse triangle in
Figure 7.20(b), we see that orthocenter X lies in the exterior of 
.
Rather than proving Theorem 7.2.3, we sketch a part of that proof. In Figure 7.21(a)
on page 322, 
is shown with its altitudes. To prove that the altitudes are concurrent
requires
1. that we draw auxiliary lines through N parallel to 
, through M parallel to 
,
and through P parallel to 
. [See Figure 7.21(b).]
2. that we show that the altitudes of 
are perpendicular bisectors of the sides
of the newly formed 
; thus, altitudes 
, 
, and 
are concurrent 
(a consequence of Theorem 7.2.2).

SKETCH OF PROOF THAT

Because

by construction. Because
a line perpendicular to one of two parallel lines must be perpendicular to the other, we have
. Now we need to show that 
bisects

because the opposite sides of a
parallelogram are congruent. By construction, MPSN is also a parallelogram and

By the Transitive Property of Congruence,

bisector of

In Figure 7.21(b), similar arguments (leading to one long proof) could be used to show
that

bisector of 
and also that 
is the
bisector of 
. Because the 
concurrent perpendicular bisectors of the sides of 
are also the altitudes of 
,
these altitudes must be concurrent.
The intersection of any two altitudes determines the orthocenter of a triangle. We use
this fact in Example 5. If the third altitude were constructed, it would contain the same
point of intersection (the orthocenter).
EXAMPLE 5
Construct the orthocenter of 
in Figure 7.22(a).
SOLUTION First construct the altitude from A to

intersect 
at X and Y. Now draw equal arcs from X and Y to intersect at Z. 
is the desired altitude. Repeat the process to construct altitude 
from vertex C
to side 
. In Figure 7.22(b), the point of intersection O is the orthocenter 
of 
.
Recall that a median of a triangle joins a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side
of the triangle. Through construction, we can show that the three medians of a triangle are
concurrent. We will discuss the proof of the following theorem in Chapter 10.

The three medians of a triangle are concurrent at a point that is two-thirds the distance
from any vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.
The point of concurrence C for the three medians is the centroid of the triangle in 
Figure 7.23. M, N, and P are midpoints of the sides of

The centroid of a triangular region is sometimes called its center of mass or center of
gravity. This is because the region of uniform thickness “balances” upon the point known
as its centroid. Consider the Discover activity at left.
It is possible for the angle bisectors of certain quadrilaterals to be concurrent.
Likewise, the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a quadrilateral can be concurrent. 
Of course, there are four angle bisectors and four perpendicular bisectors of sides to 
consider. In Example 8, we explore this situation.
EXAMPLE 8
Use intuition and Figure 7.25 to decide which of the following are concurrent.
Figure 7.25
a) The angle bisectors of a kite
c) The angle bisectors of a rectangle
b) The perpendicular bisectors of 
d) The perpendicular bisectors of the
the sides of a kite
sides of a rectangle
SOLUTION
a) The angle bisectors of the kite are concurrent at a point (the incenter of 
the kite).
b) The
bisectors of the sides of the kite are not concurrent (unless 
and
are both right angles).
c) The angle bisectors of the rectangle are not concurrent (unless the rectangle 
is a square).
d) The
bisectors of the sides of the rectangle are concurrent (the circumcenter
of the rectangle is also the point of intersection of the diagonals).
NOTE: The student should make drawings to verify the results in Example 8.

Several interesting properties of regular polygons are developed in this section. For
instance, every regular polygon has both an inscribed circle and a circumscribed circle;
furthermore, these two circles are concentric. In Example 1, we use bisectors of the angles
of a square to locate the center of the inscribed circle. The center, which is found by using
the bisectors of any two consecutive angles, is equidistant from the sides of the square.

EXAMPLE 1
Given square ABCD in Figure 7.26(a), construct inscribed 
.
Figure 7.26
SOLUTION Figure 7.26(b): The center of an inscribed circle must lie at the same 
distance from each side. Center O is the point of concurrency of the angle 
bisectors of the square. Thus, we construct the angle bisectors of 
and 
to identify point O.
Figure 7.26(c): Constructing 
, OM is the distance from O to 
and
the length of the radius of the inscribed circle. Finally we construct inscribed 
with radius 
as shown.
In Example 2, we use the perpendicular bisectors of two consecutive sides of a regu-
lar hexagon to locate the center of the circumscribed circle. The center determines a point
that is equidistant from the vertices of the hexagon.
EXAMPLE 2
Given regular hexagon MNPQRS in Figure 7.27(a), construct circumscribed 
.
Figure 7.27
SOLUTION Figure 7.27(b): The center of a circumscribed circle must lie at the same
distance from each vertex of the hexagon. In Figure 7.27(b), we construct the
perpendicular bisectors of 
and 
to locate point X. Center X is the point 
of concurrency of the perpendicular bisectors of two consecutive sides of the
hexagon. 
Figure 7.27(c): Where XM is the distance from X to vertex M, we use radius 
to construct circumscribed 
.
For a rectangle, which is not a regular polygon, we can only circumscribe a circle (see
Figure 7.28). For a rhombus (also not a regular polygon), we can only inscribe a 
circle (see Figure 7.29). 
As we shall see, we can construct both inscribed and circumscribed circles for 
regular polygons because they are both equilateral and equiangular. A few of the regular
polygons are shown in Figure 7.30 on the next page.

Regular polygons allow us to inscribe and to circumscribe a circle. The proof of the
following theorem will establish the following relationships:
1. The centers of the inscribed and circumscribed circles of a regular polygon are
the same.
2. The angle bisectors of two consecutive angles or the perpendicular bisectors of
two consecutive sides can be used to locate the common center of the inscribed
circle and the circumscribed circle.
3. The inscribed circle’s radius is any line segment from the center drawn perpen-
dicular to a side of the regular polygon; also, the radius of the circumscribed 
circle joins the center to any vertex of the regular polygon.

By continuing this procedure, we can show that

CPCTC,

as
radius, circle O can be circumscribed about ABCDEF, as shown in Figure 7.31(e).
Because 
, 
, 
,

, and 
are congruent,
we see that 
because these are the
corresponding altitudes to the bases of the congruent triangles.
Again with O as center, but now with a radius equal in length to OM, we 
complete the inscribed circle in ABCDEF. [See Figure 7.31(f).]
In the proof of Theorem 7.3.1, a regular hexagon was drawn. The method of proof
would not change, regardless of the number of sides of the polygon chosen. In the proof,
point O was the common center of the circumscribed and inscribed circles for ABCDEF.
Because any regular polygon can be inscribed in a circle, any regular polygon is cyclic.

The center of a regular polygon is the common center for the inscribed and circum-
scribed circles of the polygon.
DEFINITION
A radius of a regular polygon is any line segment that joins the center of the regular
polygon to one of its vertices.
DEFINITION
The preceding definition does not tell us how to locate the center of a regular 
polygon. The center is the intersection of the bisectors of two consecutive angles; 
alternatively, the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of two consecutive sides can
be used to locate the center of the regular polygon. Note that a regular polygon has a 
center, whether or not either of the related circles is shown. In Figure 7.32, point O is the

A central angle of a regular polygon is an angle formed by two consecutive radii of the
regular polygon.
DEFINITION
All central angles of a regular polygon are congruent.
In regular hexagon ABCDEF with center Q (in Figure 7.34), angle EQD is a central
angle. Due to the congruences of the triangles in the proof of Theorem 7.3.1, we also see
that Theorem 7.3.2 is a consequence of the following relationship.

CHAPTER 7 ■LOCUS AND CONCURRENCE

THE VALUE OF 
In geometry, any two figures that have the same shape are
described as similar. Because all circles have the same shape, we
say that all circles are similar to each other. Just as a proportion-
ality exists among the corresponding sides of similar triangles,
we can demonstrate a proportionality among the circumferences
(distances around) and diameters (distances across) of circles.
By representing the circumferences of the circles in Figure 7.35
by 
, 
, and 
and their corresponding lengths of diameters
by 
, 
, and 
, we claim that
for some constant of proportionality k.
Figure 7.35
We denote the constant k described above by the Greek letter
. Thus, 
in any circle. It follows that 
or
(because 
in any circle). In applying these 
formulas for the circumference of a circle, we often leave 
in
the answer so that the result is exact. When an approximation for
the circumference (and later for the area) of a circle is needed,
several common substitutions are used for . Among these are
and 
. A calculator may display the value
.
Because 
is needed in many applications involving the 
circumference or area of a circle, its approximation is often 
necessary; but finding an accurate approximation of 
was not
quickly or easily done. The formula for circumference can be
expressed as 
, but the formula for the area of the circle
is 
. This and other area formulas will be given more
attention in Chapter 8.
Several references to the value of 
are made in literature.
One of the earliest comes from the Bible; the passage from 
I Kings, Chapter 7, verse 23, describes the distance around a vat
as three times the distance across the vat (which suggests that 
equals 3, a very rough approximation). Perhaps no greater 
accuracy was needed in some applications of that time.
In the content of the Rhind papyrus (a document over 
3000 years old), the Egyptian scribe Ahmes gives the formula
for the area of a circle as 
. To determine the Egyptian
approximation of , we need to expand this expression as follows:
In the formula for the area of the circle, the value of 
is 
the multiplier (coefficient) of 
. Because this coefficient is 
(which has the decimal equivalent of 3.1604), the Egyptians
found a better approximation of 
than was given in the book of 
I Kings.
Archimedes, the brilliant Greek geometer, knew that the 
formula for the area of a circle was 
(with C the 
circumference and r the length of radius). His formula was
equivalent to the one we use today and is developed as follows:
The second proposition of Archimedes’ work Measure of the
Circle develops a relationship between the area of a circle and
the area of the square in which it is inscribed. (See Figure 7.36.)
Specifically, Archimedes claimed that the ratio of the area of the
circle to that of the square was 11:14. This leads to the follow-
ing set of equations and to an approximation of the value of .
Archimedes later improved his approximation of 
by showing
that
Today’s calculators provide excellent approximations for the
irrational number 
. We should recall, however, that 
is an 
irrational number that can be expressed as an exact value only by
the symbol .

PERSPECTIVE ON APPLICATIONS
THE NINE-POINT CIRCLE
In the study of geometry, there is a curiosity known as the Nine-
Point Circle—a curiosity because its practical value consists of
the reasoning needed to verify its plausibility.
In 
, in Figure 7.37 we locate these points:
M, N, and P, the midpoints of the sides of 
, D, E,
and F, points on 
determined by its altitudes, and
X, Y, and Z, the midpoints of the line segments determined
by orthocenter O and the vertices of 
.
Through these nine points, it is possible to draw or construct
the circle shown in Figure 7.37.
Figure 7.37
To understand why the Nine-Point Circle can be drawn, we
show that the quadrilateral NMZY is both a parallelogram and a
rectangle. Because 
joins the midpoints of 
and 
, we
know that 
and 
Likewise, Y and Z are 
midpoints of the sides of 
, so 
and 
By Theorem 4.2.1, NMZY is a parallelogram. Then 
must 
be parallel to 
With 
, it follows that 
must be
perpendicular to 
as well. In turn, 
, and NMZY is a
rectangle in Figure 7.37. It is possible to circumscribe a circle
about any rectangle; in fact, the length of the radius of the 
circumscribed circle is one-half the length of a diagonal of 
the rectangle, so we choose 
This circle 
certainly contains the points N, M, Z, and Y.
Figure 7.38
Although we do not provide the details, it can be shown that
quadrilateral XZPN of Figure 7.38 is a rectangle as well. Further,
is also a diagonal of rectangle XZPN. Then we can choose
the radius of the circumscribed circle for rectangle XZPN to have
the length 
Because it has the same center G
and the same length of radius r as the circle that was circum-
scribed about rectangle NMZY, we see that the same 
circle must contain points N, X, M, Z, P, and Y.
Finally, we need to show that the circle in Figure 7.39 with
center G and radius 
will contain the points D, E, and
F. This can be done by an indirect argument. If we suppose that
these points do not lie on the circle, then we contradict the fact
that an angle inscribed in a semicircle must be a right angle. Of
course, 
, 
and 
were altitudes of 
, so inscribed
angles at D, E, and F must measure 90°; in turn, these angles
must lie inside semicircles. In Figure 7.37, 
intercepts an
arc (a semicircle) determined by diameter 
. So D, E, and F are
on the same circle that has center G and radius r. Thus, the 
circle described in the preceding paragraphs is the anticipated
Nine-Point Circle!

CHAPTER 7 ■LOCUS AND CONCURRENCE
A Look Back at Chapter 7
In Chapter 7, we used the locus of points concept to establish 
the concurrence of lines relationships in Section 7.2. In turn, these 
concepts of locus and concurrence allowed us to show that a 
regular polygon has both an inscribed and a circumscribed circle;
in particular, these two circles have a common center. Several new
properties of regular polygons were discovered.
A Look Ahead to Chapter 8
One goal of the next chapter is to deal with the areas of triangles,
certain quadrilaterals, and regular polygons. We will consider
perimeters of polygons and the circumference of a circle. The area
of a circle and the area of a sector of a circle will be discussed.
Special right triangles will play an important role in determining
the areas of some of these plane figures.

Powerful! The unique shape and the massive size of the Pentagon
in Washington, D.C., manifest the notion of strength. In this chapter,
we introduce the concept of area. The area of an enclosed plane
region is a measure of size that has applications in construction, 
farming, real estate, and more. Some of the units that are used to
measure area include the square inch and the square centimeter.
While the areas of square and rectangular regions are generally 
easily calculated, we will also develop formulas for the areas of 
less common polygonal regions. In particular, Section 8.3 is devoted
to calculating the areas of regular polygons, such as the Pentagon
shown in the photograph. Many real-world applications of the area
concept are found in the examples and exercise sets of this chapter.
Areas of Polygons and Circles
Additional video explanations of concepts, sample problems, and applications are
available on DVD.

Lines are said to be one-dimensional because we can measure only the length of a line 
segment. Of course, such measures are only good approximations. A line segment is 
measured in linear units such as inches, centimeters, or yards. When a line segment 
measures 5 centimeters, we write 
cm (or 
if units are not stated). The 
instrument for measuring length is the ruler.
A plane is an infinite two-dimensional surface. A closed or bounded portion of 
the plane is called a region. When a region such as R in plane M [see Figure 8.1(a)] is 
measured, we call this measure the “area of the plane region.” The unit used to measure
area is known as a square unit because it is a square with each side of length 1 [see 
Figure 8.1(b)]. The measure of the area of region R is the number of nonoverlapping
square units that can be placed adjacent to each other in the region.

We can measure the area of the region within a triangle [see Figure 8.2(b)]. However, we 
cannot actually measure the area of the triangle itself (three line segments do not have area).
Nonetheless, the area of the region within a triangle is commonly referred to as the area of 
the triangle.
One application of area involves measuring the floor area to be covered by carpeting,
which could be measured in square feet (ft ) or square yards (
). Another application of
area involves calculating the number of squares of shingles needed to cover a roof; in this
situation, a “square” is the number of shingles needed to cover a 100-
section of the roof.
In Figure 8.2, the regions have measurable areas and are bounded by figures encoun-
tered in earlier chapters. A region is bounded if we can distinguish between its interior
and its exterior; in calculating area, we measure the interior of the region.

The preceding discussion does not formally define a region or its area. These are
accepted as the undefined terms in the following postulate.

As with the length of a line segment, the area measure of an enclosed plane region is
also an approximation. One way to estimate the area of a region is to place it in a grid, as
shown in Figure 8.3. Counting only the number of whole squares inside the region gives
an approximation that is less than the actual area. On the other hand, counting squares that
are inside or partially inside provides an approximation that is greater than the actual area.
A fair estimate of the area of a region is often given by the average of the smaller and 
larger approximations just described. If the area of the circle shown in Figure 8.3 is
between 9 and 21 square units, we might estimate its area to be 
or 15 square units.
To explore another property of area, we consider 
and 
(which are con-
gruent) in Figure 8.4. One triangle can be placed over the other so that they coincide. How
are the areas of the two triangles related? The answer is found in the following postulate.

Consider Figure 8.6. The entire region is bounded by a curve and then subdivided by
a line segment into smaller regions R and S. These regions have a common boundary and
do not overlap. Because a numerical area can be associated with each region R and S, the
area of

sum of the areas of R and S. This leads to Postulate 20, in which

Study rectangle MNPQ in Figure 8.8, and note that it has dimensions of 3 cm and 4 cm. The number of squares,

calculate the area?
ANSWER 
Multiply

If the units used to measure the dimensions of a region are not the same, then they must

Recall that one side of a rectangle is called its base and that any line segment between
sides and perpendicular to the base is called an altitude of the rectangle. The length of the
altitude is known as the height of the rectangle. In the statement of Postulate 21, we
assume that b and h are measured in like units.

No proof is given for Theorem 8.1.1, which follows immediately from Postulate 21.
AREA OF A PARALLELOGRAM
A rectangle’s altitude can be one of its sides, but that is not true of a parallelogram. An
altitude of a parallelogram is a perpendicular line segment drawn from one side to the
opposite side, known as the base. A side may have to be extended in order to show this 
altitude-base relationship in a drawing. In Figure 8.11(a), if 
is designated as the base,
then any of the segments 
, 
, or 
is an altitude corresponding to that base (or, for
that matter, to base 
).

Another look at 
[in Figure 8.11(b)] shows that 
(or

have been chosen as the base. Possible choices for the corresponding altitude in this case

COROLLARY 8.1.4
The area of a right triangle with legs of lengths a and b is given by A  1

In the proof of Corollary 8.1.4, the length of either leg can be chosen as the base; in
turn, the length of the altitude to that base is the length of the remaining leg. This follows
from the fact “The legs of a right triangle are perpendicular.”

We begin this section with a reminder of the meaning of perimeter.
Table 8.1 summarizes perimeter formulas for selected types of triangles, and Table 8.2
summarizes formulas for the perimeters of selected types of quadrilaterals. However, it is
more important to understand the concept of perimeter than to memorize formulas. Study
each figure so that you can explain its corresponding formula.

The outside boundary of an 
enclosure is called its perimeter 
or its periphery.
Geometry in the Real World
The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of all sides of the polygon.

HERON’S FORMULA
If the lengths of the sides of a triangle are known, the formula generally used to calculate
the area is Heron’s Formula (named in honor of Heron of Alexandria, circa A.D. 75). One
of the numbers found in this formula is the semiperimeter of a triangle, which is defined
as one-half the perimeter. For the triangle that has sides of lengths a, b, and c, the 
semiperimeter is 
. We apply Heron’s Formula in Example 3. The proof
of Heron’s Formula can be found at the website for this textbook.

The following theorem is named in honor of Brahmagupta, a Hindu mathematician
born in A.D. 598. We include the theorem without its rather lengthy proof. As it happens,
Heron’s Formula for the area of any triangle is actually a special case of Brahmagupta’s
Formula, which is used to determine the area of a cyclic quadrilateral. In Brahmagupta’s
Formula, as in Heron’s Formula, the letter s represents the numerical value of the 
semiperimeter. The formula is applied in essentially the same manner as Heron’s Formula.

Brahmagupta’s Formula becomes Heron’s Formula when the length d of the fourth side
shrinks (the length d approaches 0) so that the quadrilateral becomes a triangle with sides
of lengths a, b, and c.
The remaining theorems of this section contain numerical subscripts. In practice, 
subscripts enable us to distinguish quantities. For instance, the lengths of the two unequal
bases of a trapezoid are written 
(read “b sub 1”) and

the use of numerical subscripts and their interpretations.

GIVEN: Quadrilateral ABCD with 
[See Figure 8.24(a).]
PROVE:
PROOF: Through points A and C, draw lines parallel to 
. Likewise, draw lines
through B and D parallel to 
. Let the points of intersection of these lines be 
R, S, T, and V, as shown in Figure 8.24(b). Because each of the quadrilaterals
ARDE, ASBE, BECT, and CEDV is a parallelogram containing a right angle, 
each is a rectangle. 
Furthermore, 
, 
,

Then

containing a right angle. Because RSTV has dimensions

In problems involving the rhombus, we often utilize the fact that its diagonals are 
perpendicular bisectors of each other. If the length of a side and the length of either 
diagonal are known, the length of the other diagonal can be found by applying the
Pythagorean Theorem.

Because the triangles are similar, we know that 
. Because the lengths of corre-
sponding altitudes of similar triangles have the same ratio as the lengths of a pair of
corresponding sides (Theorem 5.3.2), we also know that 
. Through substitution, 
becomes 
. Then 
.
Because Theorem 8.2.7 can be extended to any pair of similar polygons, we could also
prove that the ratio of the areas of two squares equals the square of the ratio of the lengths
of any two sides. We apply this relationship in Example 8.
EXAMPLE 8
Use the ratio 
to compare the areas of
a) two similar triangles in which the sides of the first triangle are as long as 
the sides of the second triangle.
b) two squares in which each side of the first square is 3 times as long as each
side of the second square.
SOLUTION
a)
, so 
. (See Figure 8.30.)
Now 
, so that 
or 
. That is, the area of the first triangle
is the area of the second triangle.
b)
, so 
. (See Figure 8.31.) 
, so that 
or 
. That is, 
the area of the first square is 9 times the area 
of the second square.
NOTE: For Example 8, Figures 8.30 and 8.31 provide 
visual evidence of the relationship described in 
Theorem 8.2.7.

Regular polygons are, of course, both equilateral and equiangular. As we saw in 
Section 7.3, we can inscribe a circle within any regular polygon and we can circumscribe
a circle about any regular polygon. For regular hexagon ABCDEF shown in Figure 8.32,
suppose that 
and 
bisect the interior angles of ABCDEF as shown. In terms of 
hexagon ABCDEF, recall these terms and theorems.
1. Point Q, the center of regular hexagon ABCDEF, is the 
common center of both the inscribed and circumscribed 
circles for regular hexagon ABCDEF.
2.
is a radius of regular hexagon ABCDEF because it joins
the center of the regular polygon to a vertex.
3.
is an apothem of regular hexagon ABCDEF because it is
drawn from the center of the regular polygon perpendicular
to a side of the polygon.
4.
is a central angle of regular hexagon ABCDEF because center Q is the
vertex of the central angle, while the sides are consecutive radii of the polygon.

SOLUTION For this repeat of Example 3, refer to Figure 8.35 on page 363. Because
the length of apothem

NOTE: The answer found in Example 5 must repeat that of Example 3.
For Examples 6 and 7, the measures of the line segments that represent the length of the
apothem, the radius, or the side of a regular polygon depend upon relationships that  are
developed in the study of trigonometry. The methods used to find related measures will be
developed in Chapter 11 but are not given attention at this time. Using those methods, many
of the measures provided in the following examples are actually only good  approximations.

SOLUTION If 
cm, then the perimeter of regular 
octagon PQRSTUVW is

SOLUTION In 
, the perimeter is 
or 36 in.
To find the length a of an apothem, we draw the radius 
from center O to
point A and the apothem 
from O to side 
. Because the radius bisects

TESSELLATIONS
Tessellations are patterns composed strictly of interlocking and nonoverlapping regular polygons. All of the 
regular polygons of a given number of sides will be congruent. Tessellations are commonly used in design, but
especially in flooring (tiles and vinyl sheets). A pure tessellation is one formed by using only one regular polygon 
in the pattern. An impure tessellation is one formed by using two different regular polygons.
In the accompanying pure tessellation, only the regular hexagon
appears. In nature, the beehive has compartments that are regular 
hexagons. The sum of the measures of the adjacent angles must equal 
; in this case,
. It would also be possible 
to form a pure tessellation of congruent squares because the sum of the
adjacent angles’ measures would be 
.
In the impure tessellation shown, the regular octagon and the square
are used; of course, the sides of the square and the octagon must be 
congruent. In Champaign-Urbana, sidewalks found on the University of
Illinois campus use this tessellation pattern. Again it is necessary that the
sum of the adjacent angles’ measures be 
; for this impure tessellation,
.
a) Can congruent equilateral triangles be used to form a pure tessellation?
b) Can two regular hexagons and a square be used to build an impure 
tessellation?

In geometry, any two figures that have the same shape are similar; for this reason, all 
circles are similar to each other. Just as a proportionality exists among the lengths of the
sides of similar triangles, experimentation shows that there is a proportionality among the
circumferences (distances around) and the lengths of diameters (distances across) of 
circles; see the Discover activity on this page. Representing the circumferences of the 
circles in Figure 8.39 by 
, 
, and 
and their respective lengths of diameters by

LENGTH OF AN ARC
In Example 1(b), we used the phrase length of arc without a definition. Informally, the
length of an arc is the distance between the endpoints of the arc as though it were 
measured along a straight line. If we measured one-third of the circumference of the 
rubber gasket (a 120° arc) in Example 3, we would expect the length to be slightly less
than 5 in. This measurement could be accomplished by holding that part of the gasket taut
in a straight line, but not so tightly that it would be stretched.

Two further considerations regarding the measurement of arc length follow.
1. The ratio of the degree measure m of the arc to 360 (the degree measure of the
entire circle) is the same as the ratio of the length of the arc to the circumference;
that is, 
.
2. Just as 
denotes the degree measure of an arc, 
denotes the length of
the arc. Whereas 
is measured in degrees, 
is measured in linear units
such as inches, feet, or centimeters.

LIMITS
In the discussion that follows, we use the undefined term limit; in practice, a limit 
represents a numerical measure. In some situations, we seek an upper limit, a lower 
limit, or both. The following example illustrates this notion.
EXAMPLE 5
Find the upper limit (largest possible number) for the length of
a chord in a circle whose length of radius is 5 cm.
SOLUTION By considering several chords in the circle in
Figure 8.44, we see that the greatest possible length 
of a chord is that of a diameter. Thus, the limit of the 
length of a chord is 10 cm.
NOTE: Although the length of a chord must be a positive 
number, the lower limit of this length is 0.
AREA OF A CIRCLE
Now consider the problem of finding the area of a circle. To do so, let a regular polygon
of n sides be inscribed in the circle. As we consider larger and larger values of n (often
written as 
and read “n approaches infinity”), two observations can be made:
1. The length of an apothem of the regular polygon approaches the length of a
radius of the circle as its limit 
.
2. The perimeter of the regular polygon approaches the circumference of the circle
as its limit 
.

area of the circle as its limit as n increases. Using observations 1 and 2, we make the fol-
lowing claim. Because the formula for the area of a regular polygon is

AREA OF A CIRCLE
Use a protractor to divide a circle into several congruent “sectors.” For instance,
central angles will divide the circle into 
sectors. If these sectors are alternated
as shown, the resulting figure approximates a parallelogram. This parallelogram has
a base of length 
r (half the circumference of the circle) and an altitude 
of length r (radius of the circle). Based upon the formula 
, the area
of the parallelogram (and of the circle) can be seen to be

Taking the positive square root for the approximate length of radius,
A plane figure bounded by concentric circles is known as a ring or annulus (see 
Figure 8.46). The piece of hardware known as a washer has the shape of an annulus.
EXAMPLE 8
A machine cuts washers from a flat piece of metal. The radius of the inside circular
boundary of the washer is 0.3 in., and the radius of the outer circular boundary is 
0.5 in. What is the area of the annulus? Give both an exact answer and an approxi-
mate answer rounded to tenths of a square inch. Using the approximate answer, 
determine the number of square inches of material used to produce 1000 washers. 
SOLUTION Where R is the larger radius and r is the smaller radius, 
.
Then 
, or 
. The exact number of square 
inches used in producing a washer is 
, or approximately 0.5 in . 
When 1000 washers are produced, approximately 500 in of metal is used.
Many students have a difficult time remembering which expression (
or 
) is
used in the formula for the circumference or for the area of a circle. This is understandable
because each expression contains a 2, a radius length r, and the factor . To remember that
gives the circumference and 
gives the area, think about the units
involved. Considering a circle of radius 3 in., 
becomes 
or Circumference equals 18.84 inches. (We measure the distance around a circle in 
linear units such as inches.) For the circle of radius 3 in.,

AREA OF A SECTOR
Just as the length of an arc is part of the circle’s circumference, the area of a sector is part
of the area of this circle. When fractions are illustrated by using circles, is represented 
by shading a 90° sector, and is represented by shading a 120° sector (see Figure 8.48).
Thus, we make the following assumption about the measure of the area of a sector.

becomes
In applications with circles, we often seek exact answers for circumference and area;
in such cases, we simply leave 
in the result. For instance, in a circle of radius length 
5 in., the exact circumference is 10
in. and the exact area is expressed as 
.
Because a sector is bounded by two radii and an arc, the perimeter of a sector is the
sum of the lengths of the two radii and the length of its arc. In Example 2, we use the 
intercepted arc 
and apply the formula, 
.

EXAMPLE 6
Find the area of a triangle whose sides measure 5 cm, 12 cm, and 13 cm, if the radius
length of the inscribed circle is 2 cm. See Figure 8.55.
SOLUTION With the given lengths of sides, the perimeter of the triangle is
. Using 
, we have 
, 
or 
.
Because the triangle shown in Example 6 is a right triangle 
, the 
area of the triangle could have been determined by using either 
or 
. The advantage provided by Theorem 8.5.3 lies in
applications where we need to determine the length of the radius of the inscribed circle of
a triangle. We consider such an application in Example 7.
EXAMPLE 7
In an attic, wooden braces supporting the roof form a triangle whose sides measure 
4 ft, 6 ft, and 6 ft; see Figure 8.56. To the nearest inch, find the radius of the largest
circular cold-air duct that can be run through the opening formed by the braces.
SOLUTION Where s is the semiperimeter of the triangle, Heron’s Formula states that
. With 
,
we have 
. We can
simplify the area expression to 
, so 
.
Recalling Theorem 8.5.3, we know that 
. Substitution leads to

Converting to inches, it follows that 
NOTE: If the ductwork is a flexible plastic tubing, the duct having radius 17 in. can
probably be used. If the ductwork were a rigid metal or heavy plastic, the radius
might need to be restricted to perhaps 16 in.

SKETCH OF PYTHAGORAS
Pythagoras (circa 580–500 B.C.) was a Greek philosopher and
mathematician. Having studied under some of the great minds of
the day, he formed his own school around 529 B.C. in Crotona,
Italy.
Students of his school fell into two classes, the listeners and
the elite Pythagoreans. Included in the Pythagoreans were 
brilliant students, including 28 women, and all were faithful 
followers of Pythagoras. The Pythagoreans, who adhered to a
rigid set of beliefs, were guided by the principle “Knowledge is
the greatest purification.”
The apparent areas of study for the Pythagoreans included
arithmetic, music, geometry, and astronomy, but underlying
principles that led to a cult-like existence included self-
discipline, temperance, purity, and obedience. The Pythagoreans
recognized fellow members by using the pentagram (five-
pointed star) as their symbol. With their focus on virtue, politics,
and religion, the members of the
group saw themselves as above 
others. Because of their belief in
transmigration (movement of the
soul after death to another human or
animal), the Pythagoreans refused to
eat meat or fish. On one occasion, it
is said that Pythagoras came upon a
person beating a dog. Approaching that person, Pythagoras said,
“Stop beating the dog, for in this dog lives the soul of my friend;
I recognize him by his voice.”
In time, the secrecy, clannishness, and supremacy of the
Pythagoreans led to suspicion and fear on the part of other fac-
tions of society. Around 500 B.C., the revolution against the
Pythagoreans led to the burning of their primary meeting house.
Although many of the Pythagoreans died in the ensuing inferno,
it is unclear whether Pythagoras himself died or escaped.
PERSPECTIVE ON HISTORY
PERSPECTIVE ON APPLICATIONS
ANOTHER LOOK AT 
THE PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM
Some of the many proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem depend
on area relationships. One such proof was devised by President
James A. Garfield (1831–1881), twentieth president of the
United States.
In his proof, the right triangle with legs of lengths a and b and
a hypotenuse of length c is transformed into a trapezoid. See
Figures 8.57(a) and (b).
In Figure 8.57(b), the points A, B, and C are collinear. With
and 
being complementary and the sum of the angles’
measures about point B being 180°, it follows that 
is a 
right angle.
Figure 8.57
If the drawing is perceived as a trapezoid (as shown in 
Figure 8.58), the area is given by
Now we treat the trapezoid as a composite of three triangles as
shown in Figure 8.59.

The total area of regions (triangles) I, II, and III is given by
Equating the areas of the trapezoid in Figure 8.58 and the 
composite in Figure 8.59, we find that
Multiplying by 2, we have
An earlier proof (over 2000 years earlier!) of this theorem by
the Greek mathematician Pythagoras is found in many historical
works on geometry. It is not difficult to see the relationship
between the two proofs.
In the proof credited to Pythagoras, a right triangle with legs
of lengths a and b and hypotenuse of length c is reproduced 
several times to form a square. Again, points A, B, C (and C, D,
E, and so on) must be collinear. [See Figure 8.60(c).]
Figure 8.60
The area of the large square in Figure 8.61(a) is given by
Figure 8.61
Considering the composite in Figure 8.61(b), we find that
because the four right triangles are congruent. Then
Again, because of the uniqueness of area, the results (area of
square and area of composite) must be equal. Then
Another look at the proofs by President Garfield and by
Pythagoras makes it clear that the results must be consistent. In
Figure 8.62, observe that Garfield’s trapezoid must have 
one-half the area of Pythagoras’ square, while maintaining the
relationship that

A Look Back at Chapter 8
One goal of this chapter was to determine the areas of triangles, 
certain quadrilaterals, and regular polygons. We also explored the
circumference and area of a circle and the area of a sector of a 
circle. The area of a circle is sometimes approximated by using
or 
. At other times, the exact area is given by
leaving

A Look Ahead to Chapter 9
Our goal in the next chapter is to deal with a type of geometry
known as solid geometry. We will find the surface areas of solids
with polygonal or circular bases. We will also find the volumes of
these solid figures. Select polyhedra will be discussed.

Colossal! Located near Cairo, Egypt, the Great Pyramids illustrate
one of the types of solids that we study in Chapter 9. The architectural
designs of buildings often illustrate other solid shapes that we study
in this chapter. The real world is three-dimensional; that is, solids 
and space figures can be characterized by contrasting three defining
measures of length, width, and depth. Each solid determines a 
bounded region of space that has a measure known as volume. Some
units that are used to measure volume include the cubic foot and the
cubic meter. The same technique that is used to measure the volume
of the pyramid in Section 9.2 could be used to measure the volumes
of the Great Pyramids.

PRISMS
Suppose that two congruent polygons lie in parallel planes in such a way that their corre-
sponding sides are parallel. If the corresponding vertices of these polygons [such as A and
in Figure 9.1(a)] are joined by line segments, then the “solid” or “space figure” that
results is known as a prism. The congruent figures that lie in the parallel planes are the
bases of the prism. The parallel planes need not be shown in the drawings of prisms.
Suggested by an empty box, the prism is like a shell that encloses a portion of space by 
the parts of planes that form the prism; thus, a prism does not contain interior points. In 
practice, it is sometimes convenient to call a prism such as a brick a solid; of course, this
interpretation of a prism contains its interior points.
A
In Figure 9.1(a), 
, 
, 
, 
, 
, and 
are base edges of the prism,
while 
, 
, and 
are lateral edges of the prism. Because the lateral edges of this
prism are perpendicular to its base edges, the lateral faces (such as quadrilateral 
)
are rectangles. The bases and lateral faces are known collectively as the faces of the prism.
Any point at which three faces are concurrent is a vertex of the prism. Points A, B, C,
,
, and 
are the vertices of the prism.
In Figure 9.1(b), the lateral edges of the prism are not perpendicular to its base edges;
with respect to the base edges, the lateral edges are often described as oblique (slanted).
For the oblique prism, the lateral faces are parallelograms. Considering the prisms in
Figure 9.1, we are led to the following definitions.

Part of the description used to classify a prism depends on its base. For instance, the
prism in Figure 9.1(a) is a right triangular prism; in this case, the word right describes 
the prism, whereas the word triangular refers to the triangular base. Similarly, the prism
in Figure 9.1(b) is an oblique square prism. Both prisms in Figure 9.1 have an altitude (a
perpendicular segment between the planes that contain the bases) of length h, also known
as the height of the prism.
EXAMPLE 1
Name each type of prism in Figure 9.2.
Figure 9.2
SOLUTION
a) The lateral edges are perpendicular to the base edges of the hexagonal base.
The prism is a right hexagonal prism.
b) The lateral edges are oblique to the base edges of the pentagonal base. 
The prism is an oblique pentagonal prism.
c) The lateral edges are perpendicular to the base edges of the triangular 
base. Because the base is equilateral, the prism is a right equilateral 
triangular prism.

The lateral area L of a prism is the sum of the areas of all lateral faces.
DEFINITION
In the right triangular prism of Figure 9.3, a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of
either base. These dimensions are used along with the length of the altitude (denoted by h)
to calculate the lateral area, the sum of the areas of rectangles 
, 
, and
. The lateral area L of the right triangular prism can be found as follows:
where P is the perimeter of a base of the prism. This formula, 
, is valid for 
finding the lateral area of any right prism. Although lateral faces of an oblique prism 
are parallelograms, it is easy to show that the formula 
can be used to find its 
lateral area as well.

Many students (and teachers) find it easier to calculate the lateral area of a prism 
without using the formula 
. We illustrate this in Example 2.
EXAMPLE 2
The bases of the right prism shown in Figure 9.4 are equilateral pentagons with sides
of length 3 in. each. If the altitude measures 5 in., find the lateral area of the prism.
SOLUTION Each lateral face is a rectangle with dimensions 3 in. by 5 in. The area of
each rectangular face is 
. Because there are five congruent
lateral faces, the lateral area of the pentagonal prism is 
.

leads to

Recalling Heron’s Formula, we know that the base area B of the right triangular prism
in Figure 9.6 can be found by the formula
in which s is the semiperimeter of the triangular base. We will apply Heron’s Formula in
Example 3.
EXAMPLE 3
Find the total area of the right triangular prism with an altitude of length 8 in. if the
sides of the triangular bases have lengths of 13 in., 14 in., and 15 in. See Figure 9.6.
SOLUTION The lateral area is found by adding the areas of the three rectangular lat-
eral faces. That is,

As we shall see, the cube is very important in determining the volume of a solid.
VOLUME OF A PRISM
To introduce the notion of volume, we recognize that a prism encloses a portion of space. 
Without a formal definition, we say that the volume of the solid is a number that measures
the amount of enclosed space. To begin, we need a unit for measuring volume. Just as the
meter can be used to measure length and the square yard can be used to measure area, a
cubic unit is used to measure the amount of space enclosed within a bounded region of
space. One such unit is described in the following paragraph.
The volume enclosed by the cube shown in Figure 9.9 is 1 cubic inch or 1 in . The 
volume of a solid is the number of cubic units within the solid. Thus, we assume that the
volume of any solid is a positive number of cubic units.

A cube is a right square prism whose edges are congruent.

The simplest space figure for which we can determine volume is the right 
rectangular prism. Such a solid might be described as a parallelpiped or as a “box.”
Because boxes are used as containers for storage and shipping (such as a boxcar), it is
important to calculate volume as a measure of capacity. A right rectangular prism is shown
in Figure 9.10; its dimensions are length , width w, and height h.
The volume of a right rectangular prism of length 4 in., width 3 in., and height 2 in.
is easily shown to be 24 in . The volume is the product of the three dimensions of the given
solid. We see not only that 
but also that the units of volume are
. Figures 9.11(a) and (b) illustrate that the 4 by 3 by 2 box must have
the volume 24 in . We see that there are four layers of blocks, each of which is a 2 by 3
configuration of 6 in . Figure 9.11 provides the insight that leads us to our following 
postulate.

POSTULATE 25
In order to apply the formula found in Postulate 25, the units used for dimensions ,

Find the volume of a box whose dimensions are 1 ft, 8 in., and 10 in. (See 
Figure 9.12.)
SOLUTION Although it makes no difference which dimension is chosen for 
or w
or h, it is most important that the units of measure be the same. Thus, 1 ft is
replaced by 12 in. in the formula for volume:
Note that the formula for the volume of the right rectangular prism,

The solids (space figures) shown in Figure 9.14 below are pyramids. In Figure 9.14(a),
point A is noncoplanar with square base BCDE. In Figure 9.14(b), point F is noncoplanar
with its base, 
. In each space pyramid, the noncoplanar point is joined to each 
vertex as well as each point of the base. A solid pyramid results when the noncoplanar
point is joined both to points on the polygon as well as to points in its interior. Point A is
known as the vertex or apex of the square pyramid; likewise, point F is the vertex or apex
of the triangular pyramid. The pyramid of Figure 9.14(b) has four triangular faces; for
this reason, it is called a tetrahedron.

The pyramid in Figure 9.15 is a pentagonal pyramid. It has vertex K, pentagon
LMNPQ for its base, and lateral edges

triangles; 
is one of the five lateral faces of the pentagonal pyramid. Including base
LMNPQ, this pyramid has a total of six faces. The altitude of the pyramid, of length h, is
the line segment from the vertex K perpendicular to the plane of the base. In every 
pyramid, the lateral edges are concurrent at the vertex (apex) of the pyramid. Likewise, the
lateral faces are concurrent at the apex of the pyramid.

.

Suppose that the pyramid in Figure 9.15 on page 399, is a regular pentagonal 
pyramid. Then the lateral faces are necessarily congruent to each other; by SSS,
. Each lateral face is an isosceles 
triangle. In a regular pyramid, the altitude joins the apex of the pyramid to the center of
the regular polygon that is the base of the pyramid. The length of the altitude is height h.

NOTE: Among pyramids, only a regular pyramid has a slant height.
In our formulas and explanations, we use 
to represent the length of the slant height
of a regular pyramid. See Figure 9.16(c) in Example 1.
EXAMPLE 1
For a regular square pyramid with height 4 in. and base edges of length 6 in. each,
find the length of the slant height . 
SOLUTION In Figure 9.16, it can be shown that the apothem to any side has length
3 in. (one-half the length of the side of the square base). Also, the slant height is
the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs equal to the lengths of the altitude of
the pyramid and the apothem of the base. See Figure 9.16(c). Applying the
Pythagorean Theorem,

To lay the groundwork for the next theorem, we justify the result by “taking apart” one of
the regular pyramids and laying it out flat. Although we use a regular hexagonal pyramid
for this purpose, the argument is similar if the base is any regular polygon.
When the lateral faces of the regular pyramid are folded down into the plane, as shown
in Figure 9.17, the shaded lateral area is the sum of the areas of the congruent triangular
lateral faces. Using 
, we find that the area of each triangular face is 
(each
side of the base of the pyramid has length s, and the slant height has length ). The 
combined areas of the triangles give the lateral area. Because there are n triangles,
where P is the perimeter of the base.

VOLUME OF A PYRAMID
The final theorem in this section is presented without any attempt to construct the proof. In
an advanced course such as calculus, the statement can be proved. The factor “one-third”
in the formula for the volume of a pyramid provides exact results. This formula can be 
applied to any pyramid, even one that is not regular; in Figure 9.20(b), the length of the 
altitude is the perpendicular distance from the vertex to the plane of the square base. Read

In Example 5, we apply Theorem 9.2.5. This application of the Pythagorean Theorem
relates the lengths of the lateral edge, the radius of the base, and the altitude of a regular
pyramid. Figure 9.21(c) provides a visual interpretation of the theorem.
EXAMPLE 5
Find the volume of the regular square pyramid in Figure 9.21(a).
Figure 9.21
SOLUTION The length of the altitude of the pyramid is represented by h, which is
determined as follows.
The altitude meets the diagonals of the square base at their common midpoint
[see Figure 9.21(b)]. Each diagonal of the base has the length 
by the 
45°-45°-90° relationship. Thus, the radius of the square base measures 
. 
In Figure 9.21(c), we have a right triangle whose legs are of lengths 
and

Plane and solid figures may have line symmetry and point symmetry. However, solid
figures may also have plane symmetry. To have this type of symmetry, a plane can be
drawn for which each point of the space figure has a corresponding point on the opposite
side of the plane at the same distance from the plane.
Each solid in Figure 9.24 has more than one plane of symmetry. In Figure 9.24(a), the
plane of symmetry shown is determined by the midpoints of the indicated edges of the
“box.” Note that the box also has both line symmetry and point symmetry. In 
Figure 9.24(b), the plane determined by the apex and the midpoints of opposite sides of
the square base leads to plane symmetry for the pyramid. The pyramid also has line sym-
metry, but it does not have point symmetry.

Because

, the solid on the left is an oblique
circular cylinder. With 
perpendicular to planes P and 
, the solid on the right is a
right circular cylinder. For both cylinders, the distance h between the planes P and

the length of the altitude of the cylinder; h is also called the height of the cylinder. The
congruent circles are known as the bases of each cylinder.

A right circular cylinder is shown in Figure 9.26; however, the parallel planes (such
as P and 
in Figure 9.25) are not pictured. The line segment joining the centers of the
two circular bases is known as the axis of the cylinder. For a right circular cylinder, it is
necessary that the axis be perpendicular to the planes of the circular bases; in such a case,
the length of the altitude h is the length of the axis.

Think of the labeled part of the aluminum can as a right circular
cylinder. For the cylinder, the lateral surface is the “label” of the
can. If the label were sliced downward by a perpendicular line
between the planes, removed, and rolled out flat, it would be rec-
tangular in shape. As shown below, that rectangle would have a
length equal to the circumference of the circular base and a width
equal to the height of the cylinder. Thus, the lateral area is given

In considering the volume of a right circular cylinder, recall that the volume of a prism is
given by 
, where B is the area of the base. In Figure 9.28, we inscribe a prism in
the cylinder as shown. Suppose that the prism is regular and that the number of sides in the
inscribed polygon’s base increases without limit; thus, the base approaches a circle 
in this limiting process. The area of the polygonal base also approaches the area of the 
circle, and the volume of the prism approaches that of the right circular cylinder. Our 
conclusion is stated without proof in the following theorem.

interior of the circle, a solid is formed. If 
is not perpendicular to the plane of circle O
in Figure 9.30, the cone is an oblique circular cone.
In Figures 9.30 and 9.31, point P is the vertex (or apex) of the cone, and circle O is
the base. The segment 
, which joins the vertex to the center of the circular base, is the
axis of the cone. If the axis is perpendicular to the plane containing the base, as in Figure
9.31, the cone is a right circular cone. In any cone, the perpendicular segment from the
vertex to the plane of the base is the altitude of the cone. In a right circular cone, the length
h of the altitude equals the length of the axis. For a right circular cone, and only for this
type of cone, any line segment that joins the vertex to a point on the circle is a slant height
of the cone; we will denote the length of the slant height by 
as shown in Figure 9.31.
SURFACE AREA OF A CONE
Recall now that the lateral area for a regular pyramid is given by 
. For a right 
circular cone, consider an inscribed regular pyramid as in Figure 9.32. As the number of
sides of the inscribed polygon’s base grows larger, the perimeter of the inscribed polygon
approaches the circumference of the circle as a limit. In addition, the slant height of the
congruent triangular faces approaches that of the slant height of the cone. Thus, the 
lateral area of the right circular cone can be compared to 
; for the cone, we have

SOLIDS OF REVOLUTION
Suppose that part of the boundary for a plane region is a line segment. When the plane
region is revolved about this line segment, the locus of points generated in space is called
a solid of revolution. The complete 360° rotation moves the region about the edge until
the region returns to its original position. The side (edge) used is called the axis of the
resulting solid of revolution. Consider Example 5.
EXAMPLE 5
Describe the solid of revolution that results when
a) a rectangular region with dimensions 2 ft
by 5 ft is revolved about the 5-ft side as 
shown in Figure 9.35(a).
b) a semicircular region with radius of length
3 cm is revolved about the diameter shown
in Figure 9.35(b).
SOLUTION
a) In Figure 9.35(a), the rectangle on the left
is revolved about the 5-ft side to form the 
solid on the right. The solid of revolution generated is a right circular cylinder
that has a base radius length of 2 ft and an altitude measuring 5 ft.
b) In Figure 9.35(b), the semicircle on the left is revolved about its diameter to
form the solid on the right. The solid of revolution generated is a sphere with
a radius of length 3 cm.
NOTE: We will study the sphere in greater detail in Section 9.4.
EXAMPLE 6
Determine the exact volume of the solid of revolution formed when the region 
bounded by a right triangle with legs of lengths 4 in. and 6 in. is revolved about 
the 6-in. side. The triangular region is shown in Figure 9.36(a) on page 416.

It may come as a surprise that the formulas that are used to calculate the volumes of an
oblique circular cylinder and a right circular cylinder are identical. To see why the formula
or 
can be used to calculate the volume of an oblique circular cylinder,
consider the stacks of pancakes shown in Figures 9.37(a) and 9.37(b). With each stack h
units high, the volume is the same regardless of whether the stack is vertical or oblique.

It is also true that the formula for the volume of an oblique circular cone is the same
as the formula for the volume of the right circular cone. In fact, the motivating argument
preceding Theorem 9.3.7 could be repeated, with the exception that the inscribed pyramid
is oblique. For both the right circular cone and the oblique circular cone,

POLYHEDRONS
When two planes intersect, the angle formed by two half-planes with a common edge (the
line of intersection) is a dihedral angle. The angle shown in Figure 9.38 is such an angle;
in that figure, the measure of the dihedral angle is the same as that of the angle determined
by two rays that
1. have a vertex (the common endpoint) on the edge.
2. lie in the planes so that they are perpendicular to the edge.
Recall that three (or more) planes can intersect 
in a point; in this situation, the planes are said to 
be concurrent at that point. A polyhedron (plural 
polyhedrons or polyhedra) is a solid bounded by four
or more plane regions. Polygons form the faces of the
solid, and the line segments common to these polygons
are the edges of the polyhedron. Endpoints of the
edges are the vertices of the polyhedron. When a 
polyhedron is convex, each face determines a plane for
which all remaining faces lie on the same side of that plane. Figure 9.39(a) illustrates a
convex polyhedron, and Figure 9.39(b) illustrates a concave polyhedron. In the concave
polyhedron, at least one diagonal lies in the exterior of the polyhedron.
Figure 9.39
The prisms and pyramids discussed in Sections 9.1 and 9.2 were special types of 
polyhedrons. For instance, a pentagonal pyramid can be described as a hexahedron
because it has six faces. Because some of their surfaces do not lie in planes, the cylinders
and cones of Section 9.3 are not polyhedrons.
Leonhard Euler (Swiss, 1707–1763) found that the number of vertices, edges, and
faces of any polyhedron are related by Euler’s equation. This equation is given in the 
following theorem, which is stated without proof.

folding shown below is known as
origami. Starting with a square piece
of paper, the goal of the origami 
practitioner is to create numerous
three-dimensional figures (geometric,

commonly created of the origami 
figures is the crane; see below. So
many people have found origami to

EXAMPLE 1
Verify Euler’s equation for the (a) tetrahedron and (b) square pyramid shown in
Figure 9.40(a) and (b), respectively.
SOLUTION
a) The tetrahedron has four vertices 
, six edges 
, and four faces
. So Euler’s equation becomes 
, which is true.
b) The pyramid has five vertices (apex
vertices from the base), eight edges
(4 base edges
4 lateral edges), and five faces (4 triangular faces
1
square base). Now 
becomes 
, which is
also true.
A polyhedron must have at least four faces. Special names are given to polyhedra having
a specific number of faces. See Table 9.4.

REGULAR POLYHEDRONS
A regular polyhedron is a convex polyhedron whose faces are congruent regular 
polygons, all of the same type.
DEFINITION
There are exactly five regular polyhedrons, named as follows:
1. Regular tetrahedron: with 4 faces that are congruent equilateral triangles
2. Regular hexahedron (or cube): with 6 faces that are congruent squares
3. Regular octahedron: with 8 faces that are congruent equilateral triangles
4. Regular dodecahedron: with 12 faces that are congruent regular pentagons
5. Regular icosahedron: with 20 faces that are congruent equilateral triangles

Four of the regular polyhedrons are shown in Figure 9.41.
Regular Polyhedrons
Figure 9.41
Because each regular polyhedron has a central point, each solid is said to have a center.
Except for the tetrahedron, these polyhedrons have point symmetry at the center. All regu-
lar polyhedra have line symmetry and plane symmetry as well.
EXAMPLE 2
Consider a die that is a regular tetrahedron with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Assuming that each face has an equal chance of being rolled, what is the likelihood
(probability) that one roll produces (a) a “1”? (b) a result larger than “1”?
SOLUTION
a) With four equally likely results (1, 2, 3, and 4), the probability of a “1” is .
b) With four equally likely results (1, 2, 3, and 4) and three “favorable” outcomes
(2, 3, and 4), the probability of rolling a number larger than a “1” is .
SPHERES
Another type of solid with which you are familiar is the sphere. Although the surface of a
basketball correctly depicts the sphere, we often use the term sphere to refer to a solid 
like a baseball as well. A sphere can be inscribed in or circumscribed about any regular
polyhedron because it has point symmetry about its center.

Reminder
The sphere was described as a locus
of points in Chapter 7.
In space, the sphere is characterized in three ways:
1. A sphere is the locus of points at a fixed distance r from a given point O. Point O is
known as the center of the sphere, even though it is not a part of the spherical surface.
2. A sphere is the surface determined when a circle (or semicircle) is rotated about any of
its diameters.
3. A sphere is the surface that represents the theoretical limit of an “inscribed” regular
polyhedron whose number of faces increases without limit.
NOTE: In characterization 3, suppose that the number of faces of the regular polyhedron
could grow without limit. In theory, the resulting regular polyhedra would appear 
more “spherical” as the number of faces increases without limit. In reality, a regular
polyhedron can have no more than 20 faces (the regular icosahedron). It will be 
necessary to use this third characterization of the sphere when we determine the 
formula for its volume.
Each characterization of the sphere has its advantages.
Characterization 1
In Figure 9.42, a sphere was generated as the locus of points in space at a distance r from
point O. The line segment 
is a radius of sphere O, and 
is a diameter of the sphere.
The intersection of a sphere and a plane that contains its center is a great circle of the sphere.

SURFACE AREA OF A SPHERE
Characterization 2
The following theorem claims that the surface area of a sphere equals four times the area
of a great circle of that sphere. This theorem, which is proved in many calculus textbooks,
treats the sphere as a surface of revolution.

VOLUME OF A SPHERE
Characterization 3
The third description of the sphere enables us to find its volume. To accomplish this, we
treat the sphere as the theoretical limit of an inscribed regular polyhedron whose number
of faces n increases without limit. The polyhedron can be separated into n congruent 
pyramids; the center of the sphere is the vertex of each pyramid. As n increases, the length
of the altitude of each pyramid approaches the length of the radius of the sphere. Next we
find the sum of the volumes of these pyramids, the limit of which is the volume of the
sphere.
In Figure 9.43, one of the pyramids described in the preceding paragraph is shown.
We designate the height of each and every pyramid by h. Where the areas of the bases of
the pyramids are written 
, and so on, the sum of the volumes of the n pyramids
forming the polyhedron is
Next we write the volume of the polyhedron in the form
As n increases, 
and 
, the surface area of the 
sphere. That is, 
. Because the surface area of the 
sphere is 
, the sum approaches the following limit as the volume of the sphere:

diameter of length 12 cm [see Figure 9.46(a)]

CHAPTER 9 ■SURFACES AND SOLIDS
SKETCH OF RENÉ DESCARTES
René Descartes was born in Tours, France, on March 31, 1596,
and died in Stockholm, Sweden, on February 11, 1650. He was
a contemporary of Galileo, the Italian scientist responsible for
many discoveries in the science of dynamics. Descartes was also
a friend of the French mathematicians Marin Mersenne
(Mersenne Numbers) and Blaise Pascal (Pascal’s Triangle).
As a small child, René Descartes was in poor health much of
the time. Because he spent so much time reading in bed during
his illnesses, he became a very well-educated young man. When
Descartes was older and stronger, he joined the French army. It
was during his time as a soldier that Descartes had three dreams
that vastly influenced his future. The dreams, dated to November
10, 1619, shaped his philosophy and laid the framework for his
discoveries in mathematics.
Descartes resigned his commission with the army in 1621 so
that he could devote his life to studying philosophy, science, and
mathematics. In the ensuing years, Descartes came to be highly
regarded as a philosopher and mathematician and was invited to
the learning centers of France, Holland, and Sweden.
Descartes’s work in mathematics, in which he used an
oblique coordinate system as a means of representing points, led
to the birth of analytical geometry. His convention for locating
points was eventually replaced by a coordinate system with 
perpendicular axes. In this system, algebraic equations could 
be represented by geometric figures; subsequently, many 
conjectured properties of these figures could be established
through algebraic (analytic) proof. The rectangular coordinate
system (which is called the Cartesian system in honor of
Descartes) can also be used to locate the points of intersection 
of geometric figures such as lines and circles. Much of the 
material in Chapter 10 depends on his work.
Generally, the phrase conic sections refers to four geometric
figures: the circle, the parabola, the ellipse, and the 
hyperbola. These figures are shown in Figure 9.48 both 
individually and also in relation to the upper and lower nappes
of a cone. The conic sections are formed when a plane intersects
the nappe(s) of a cone.
Other mathematical works of Descartes were devoted to the
study of tangent lines to curves. The notion of a tangent to a
curve is illustrated in Figure 9.49; this concept is the basis for the
branch of mathematics known as differential calculus.
Descartes’s final contributions to mathematics involved 
his standardizing the use of many symbols. To mention a few of
these, Descartes used (1) 
rather than aa and 
rather than
aaa; (2) ab to indicate multiplication; and (3) a, b, and c as 
constants and x, y, and z as variables.

PERSPECTIVE ON APPLICATIONS
BIRDS IN FLIGHT
The following application of 
geometry is not so much practical
as classical.
Two birds have been attracted
to bird feeders that rest atop verti-
cal poles. The bases of these poles
where their perches are located
are 20 ft apart. The poles are
themselves 10 ft and 16 ft tall. See Figure 9.50. Each bird eyes
birdseed that has fallen on the ground at the base of the other
pole. Leaving their perches, the birds fly in a straight-line path
toward their goal. Avoiding a collision in flight, the birds take
paths that have them pass at a common point X. How far is the
point above ground level?
The solution to the problem follows. However, we redraw the
figure to indicate that the 20-ft distance between poles is 
separated along the ground into line segments with lengths of a
and 
as shown. See Figures 9.51(a), 9.51(b), and 9.51(c).
Figure 9.51
From Figures 9.51(b) and 9.51(c), we form the following 
equations based upon the similarity of the right triangles:
By the Means-Extremes Property of Proportions,
and 
. By substitution,
From the fact that 
, we see that
so
The point at which the birds flew past each other was 
feet
above the ground.

A Look Back at Chapter 9
Our goal in this chapter was to deal with a type of geometry known
as solid geometry. We found formulas for the lateral area, the total
area (surface area), and the volume of prisms, pyramids, cylinders,
cones, and spheres. Some of the formulas used in this chapter were
developed using the concept of “limit.” Regular polyhedra were
introduced.
A Look Ahead to Chapter 10
Our focus in the next chapter is analytic (or coordinate) geometry.
This type of geometry relates algebra and geometry. Formulas for
the midpoint of a line segment, the length of a line segment, and the
slope of a line will be developed. We will not only graph the equa-
tions of lines but also determine equations for given lines. We will
see that proofs of many geometric theorems can be completed by
using analytic geometry.

Guidance! The French mathematician René Descartes is considered
the father of analytic geometry. His inspiration relating algebra and
geometry, the Cartesian coordinate system (or Cartesian plane), was a
major breakthrough in the development of much of mathematics. The
photograph illustrates the use of a GPS (global positioning system).
The system allows one to pinpoint locations such as that of a moving
vehicle or that of a destination. On the map, locations identified by
latitude and longitude are comparable to points whose x and y coordi-
nates locate a position in the Cartesian coordinate system. Cartesian
space extends the relationship between algebra and geometry to three
dimensions; in this system, each point has three coordinates.

CHAPTER 10 ■ANALYTIC GEOMETRY
Unless otherwise noted, all content on this page is © Cengage Learning.
Graphing the solution sets for 
and 
requires a single number
line to indicate the value of x. (See Appendices A.2 and A.3 for further information.) In
this chapter, we deal with equations containing two variables; to relate such algebraic
statements to plane geometry, we will need two number lines.
The study of the relationships between number pairs and points is known as 
analytic geometry. The Cartesian coordinate system or rectangular coordinate system
is the plane that results when two number lines intersect perpendicularly at the origin (the
point corresponding to the number 0 of each line). This two-dimensional coordinate plane
is often called the Cartesian plane, named in honor of René Descartes (see Perspective on
History for Chapter 9). The horizontal number line is known as the x axis, and its numer-
ical coordinates increase from left to right. On the vertical number line, the y axis, values
increase from bottom to top; see Figure 10.1. The scale (unit size) is generally the same
for the x axis and the y axis. The two axes separate the plane into four quadrants which
are numbered counterclockwise I, II, III, and IV, as shown. The point that marks the com-
mon origin of the two number lines is the origin of the rectangular coordinate system. It
is convenient to identify the origin as (0, 0); this notation indicates that the x coordinate
(listed first) is 0 and also that the y coordinate (listed second) is 0.
In the coordinate system, each point has the order 
and is called an ordered pair.
In Figure 10.2, the point 
for which 
and 
is shown. The point
is located by moving 3 units to the right of the origin and then 2 units down 
from the x axis. The dashed lines shown emphasize the reason why the grid is called the
rectangular coordinate system. The point 
is located in Quadrant IV. In Figure 10.2,
ordered pairs of positive and negative signs characterize the signs of the coordinates of a
point located in each quadrant.
EXAMPLE 1
Plot points A
and B
, and find the 
distance between them.
SOLUTION Point A is located by moving 3 units 
to the left of the origin and then 4 units up 
from the x axis. Point B is located by moving 
2 units to the right of the origin and then 4 units
up from the x axis. In Figure 10.3, 
is a 
horizontal segment.
In the rectangular coordinate system, ABCD
is a rectangle in which 
; 
is easily
measured because it lies on the x axis. Because
the opposite sides of a rectangle are congruent, 
it follows that

In Example 1, the points 
and 
have the same y coordinates. In this case,
the distance between the points on a horizontal line is merely the positive difference in the
x coordinates; thus, the distance between A and B is 
, or 5. It is also easy to find
the distance between two points on a vertical line; if the x coordinates of two points are the
same, the distance between points is the positive difference in the y coordinates. In Figure
10.3, where C is (2, 0) and B is (2, 4), the distance between the points is 
or 4.
In the following definition, the repeated y coordinates for the endpoints of the line seg-
ment indicate that the segment is horizontal.

DEFINITION
In the following definition, repeated x coordinates for the endpoints of a line segment
determine a vertical line segment. In both definitions, the distance between points is found
by subtracting the smaller from the larger of the two unequal coordinates.
EXAMPLE 2
In Figure 10.4, name the coordinates of points C and D, and find the distance 
between them. The x coordinates of C and D are identical because the points lie 
on a vertical line.
SOLUTION C is the point (0, 1) because C is 1 unit above the origin; similarly, D is
the point (0, 5). We designate the coordinates of point C by 
and 
and the coordinates of point D by 
and 
. Using the preceding 
definition,
We now turn our attention to the more general problem of finding the distance
between any two points. In this situation, the line segment described is neither vertical nor
horizontal.
THE DISTANCE FORMULA
The following formula enables us to find the distance between two points that lie on a
“slanted” line.

PROOF
In the coordinate system in Figure 10.5 are points 
and 
. In addition to
drawing the segment joining these points, we draw an auxiliary horizontal segment
through 
and an auxiliary vertical segment through 
; these meet at point C
in
Figure 10.5(a). Using Figure 10.5(b) and the definitions for lengths of horizontal and 
vertical segments,

In right triangle 
of Figure 10.5(b), let 
. By the Pythagorean Theorem,
Taking the positive square root for length d yields
EXAMPLE 3
In Figure 10.6, find the distance between points 
and 
.
SOLUTION Using the Distance Formula and choosing 
and 
(from point A) and 
and 
(from point B), we obtain
NOTE: If the coordinates of point A were designated as 
and 
and
those of point B were designated as 
and 
, the distance would remain
the same.
If we look back at the proof of the Distance Formula, Figure 10.5 shows only one 
of several possible placements of points. If the placement had been as shown in 
Figure 10.7, then 
because

because

The Pythagorean Theorem leads to what looks like a different result:
But this can be converted to the earlier formula by using the fact that

The following example reminds us of the form of a linear equation, an equation
whose graph is a straight line. In general, the form of a linear equation is 
for constants A, B, and C (where A and B do not both equal 0). We will consider the graph-
ing of linear equations in Section 10.2.
EXAMPLE 4
Find the equation that describes all points 
that are equidistant from 
and 
. See Figure 10.8.
SOLUTION In Chapter 7, we saw that the locus of points equidistant from two 
fixed points is a line. This line (
in Figure 10.8) is the perpendicular 
bisector of 
.
If X is on the locus, then 
. By the Distance Formula, we have
or
after simplifying and squaring. Then
Eliminating 
and 
terms by subtraction leads to the equation
When we divide by 4, the equation of the line becomes
If we divide the equation 
by 
, an equivalent solution is
NOTE: The equations 
and 
are said to be 
equivalent because their solutions are the same. For instance, 
, (2, 3), 
and (6, 6) are all solutions for both equations.
THE MIDPOINT FORMULA
In Figure 10.8, point M is the midpoint of 
. It will be shown in Example 5(a) that M is
the point (2, 3). The Distance Formula can be used to verify that 
.
A generalized midpoint formula is given in Theorem 10.1.2. The result shows that the
coordinates of the midpoint M of a line segment are the averages of the coordinates of the
endpoints. See the Discover activity at the left.

For Example 5(a), the line segment described is shown in Figure 10.8 on page 439;
from appearances, the solution seems reasonable! In Example 5(b), we are generalizing 
the coordinates in preparation for the analytic geometry proofs that appear later in the
chapter. For those proofs, we choose the x and y values for each point in such a way as
to represent the general case.

Let the coordinates of M be designated by

In Section 10.1, we were reminded that the general form of the equation of a line is
(where A and B do not both equal 0). Some examples of linear equations
are 
, 
, and 
; as we shall see, the graph of each of
these equations is a line.

In the rectangular coordinate system, the graph of an equation is the set of all points 
(x, y) whose ordered pairs satisfy the equation.
DEFINITION
EXAMPLE 1
Draw the graph of the equation 
.
SOLUTION We begin by completing a table. It is 
convenient to use one point for which 
,
a second point for which 
, and a third 
point as a check for collinearity.

Upon plotting the third point, we see that the three points are collinear. The graph
of a linear equation must be a straight line, as shown in Figure 10.10.
For the graph and equation in Example 1, every point on the line must also 
satisfy the given equation. Notice that the point 
lies on the line shown in 
Figure 10.10. This ordered pair also satisfies the equation 
; that is,
because

b)
and 
Testing 
, we see that 
, which is
true; 
is also on the graph.
For the equation 
, the number 6 is known as the x intercept because
is the point at which the graph crosses the x axis; similarly, the number 4 is known
as the y intercept. See Figure 10.10 on page 444. Most linear equations have two 
intercepts; these are generally represented by a (the x intercept) and b (the y intercept).

EXAMPLE 3
Find the x and y intercepts of the equation 
, and use the intercepts
to graph the equation.
SOLUTION The x intercept is found when 
, so 
.
The x intercept is 
, so 
is on the graph. The y intercept results
when 
; 
, so 
. The y intercept is 
, so (0, 3)
is on the graph. Once the points 
and (0, 3) have been plotted, the graph
can be completed by drawing the line through these points. See Figure 10.11.
As we shall see in Example 4, a linear equation may have only one intercept. It is
impossible for a linear equation to have no intercepts whatsoever.
EXAMPLE 4
Draw the graphs of the following equations:

SOLUTION First note that each equation is a linear equation and can be written in the
form

the vertical line containing the point (a, 0). When an equation can be written in the form
(for constant b), its graph is the horizontal line containing the point (0, b).
THE SLOPE OF A LINE
Most lines are oblique; that is, the line is neither horizontal nor vertical. Especially for
oblique lines, it is convenient to describe the amount of “slant” by a number called the
slope of the line.

is given by

DEFINITION ■Slope Formula
NOTE: When 
, the denominator of the Slope Formula becomes 0 and we say that
the slope of the line is undefined or that the slope of the line does not exist.
Whereas the uppercase italic M means midpoint, we use the lowercase italic m to rep-
resent the slope of a line. Other terms that are used to describe the slope of a line include
pitch and grade. A carpenter may say that a roofline has a 
pitch. [See Figure 10.13(a).]
In constructing a stretch of roadway, an engineer may say that this part of the roadway has
a grade of 
, or 3 percent. [See Figure 10.13(b).]
Figure 10.13
Whether in geometry, carpentry, or engineering, the slope of a line is a number. The
slope of the line is the ratio of the vertical change (rise) to the horizontal change (run). For
any two points on the line in question, a line that “rises” from left to right has a positive
slope, and a line that “falls” from left to right has a negative slope. The lines shown in
Figures 10.14(a) and (b) on page 447 confirm these claims.

Figure 10.14
Any horizontal line has slope 0; any vertical line has an undefined slope. Figure 10.15
shows an example of each of these types of lines.
EXAMPLE 5
Without graphing, find the slope of the line that contains:
a) (2, 2) and (5, 3)
b)
and (1, 3)
SOLUTION
a) Using the Slope Formula and choosing 
, 
, 
, and 
,
we have
.
NOTE: If drawn, the line in part (a) will slant upward from left to right.
b) Let 
, 
, 
, and 
. Then we calculate
,
which is undefined.
NOTE: If drawn, the line in part (b) will be vertical because the x coordinates of the
points are the same.
The slope of a line is unique; that is, the slope does not change when:
1. The order of the two points is reversed in the Slope Formula.
2. Different points on the line are selected.
The first situation is true because 
. The second situation is more difficult to explain
because it depends on similar triangles.
For an explanation of point 2, consider Figure 10.16, in which points 
, 
, and 
are collinear. We wish to show that the slope of the line is the same whether 
and 
or 
and 
are used in the Slope Formula. If horizontal and vertical segments are drawn
as shown in Figure 10.16, we can show that triangles 
and 
are similar. The 
similarity follows from the facts that

are right angles. Then 
because these are corresponding sides of similar triangles. 
By interchanging the means, we have 
. But
so
Thus, the slope of the line is not changed by our having used either pair of points. In sum-
mary, the slopes agree because of similar triangles.
If points 
, and 
are collinear, then the slopes of 
, 
, and 
are the
same. The converse of this statement is also true. If the slopes of 
, 
, and 
are
equal, then 
, and 
are collinear. See Example 6 for an application.
EXAMPLE 6
Are the points 
, 
, and 
collinear?
SOLUTION Let 
and 
represent the slopes of 
and 
, respectively. By the
Slope Formula, we have
Because 
, it follows that A, B, and C are collinear.
As we trace a line from one point to a second point, the Slope Formula tells us that
This interpretation of slope is used in Example 7.
EXAMPLE 7
Draw the line through 
so that it has slope 
.
SOLUTION First we plot the point 
. The slope can be written as 
.
Thus, we let the change in y from the first to the second point be 
while 
the change in x is 3. From the first point 
, we locate the second point 
by moving 2 units down and 3 units to the right. The line is then drawn as 
shown in Figure 10.17.
Theorems 10.2.1 and 10.2.2 are stated without proof. However, drawings needed for
the proofs of the theorems are found in Figures 10.18 and 10.19. Each proof depends on 
similar triangles created through the use of the auxiliary segments found in the drawings.

.
In Example 8, it was worthwhile to sketch the lines described. It is apparent from
Figure 10.20 that the lines are not perpendicular. A sketch may help to show that a
relationship does not exist, but sketching is not a precise method for showing that lines are
parallel or perpendicular.

perpendicular, or neither?
SOLUTION Because

thus, its slope is

SOLUTION The line 
contains the points (4, 0) and (0, 3); this line has
the slope
For the two lines to be perpendicular, the second line must have slope . Using
the Slope Formula, we find that the second line has the slope
so
Multiplying by 3, we obtain 
. It follows that 
.
EXAMPLE 11
In Figure 10.21, show that the quadrilateral with
vertices A(0, 0), B(a, 0), C(a, b), and D(0, b) is a
rectangle.
SOLUTION By applying the Slope Formula, we
see that
and
.
Then 
and 
are both horizontal and, 
therefore, parallel to each other.
For 
and 
, the slopes are undefined because the denominators in the
Slope Formula both equal 0. Then 
and 
are both vertical and, therefore,
parallel to each other.
Thus, ABCD is a parallelogram. With 
being horizontal and 
vertical, it 
follows that 
. Therefore, ABCD is a rectangle by definition.

In this section, we lay the groundwork for constructing analytic proofs of geometric 
theorems. An analytic proof requires the use of the coordinate system and the application
of the formulas found in earlier sections of this chapter. Because of the need for these 
formulas, a summary follows in Table 10.1. Be sure that you have committed to memory
these formulas and know when and how to use them.
EXAMPLE 1
Suppose that you are to prove the following relationships:
a) Two lines are parallel.
b) Two lines are perpendicular.
c) Two line segments are congruent.
Which formula(s) from Table 10.1 would you need to use? How would you complete
your proof?
SOLUTION
a) Use the Slope Formula to find the slope of each line. Then show that the
slopes are equal.
b) Use the Slope Formula to find the slope of each line. Then show that
.
c) Use the Distance Formula to find the length of each line segment. Then show
that the resulting lengths are equal.

The following example has a proof that is subtle. Figure 10.22 is provided to help you
understand the concept.
EXAMPLE 2
How can the Midpoint Formula be used to verify that the two line segments shown in
Figure 10.22 bisect each other?
SOLUTION If 
bisects 
, and conversely, then M is the common midpoint of 
the two line segments. The Midpoint Formula is used to find the midpoint of
each line segment, and the results are then shown to be the same point. This
establishes that each line segment has been bisected at a point that is found 
on each line segment.

To construct proofs of geometric theorems by using analytic methods, we must use the
hypothesis to determine the drawing. Unlike the drawings in Chapters 1–9, the 
figure must be placed in the coordinate system. Making the drawing requires careful 
placement of the figure and strategically naming the coordinates of the vertices in that 
figure. The following guidelines should prove helpful in positioning the figure and in 
naming its vertices.

Some considerations for preparing the drawing:
1. Coordinates of the vertices must be general; for instance, you may use (a, b) as a 
vertex, but do not use a specific point such as (2, 3).
2. Make the drawing satisfy the hypothesis without providing any additional qualities;
if the theorem describes a rectangle, draw and label a rectangle but not a square.
3. For simplicity in your calculations, drop the figure into the rectangular coordinate
system in such a manner that
a) as many 0 coordinates as possible are used.
b) the remaining coordinates represent positive numbers due to the positioning of the
remaining vertices in Quadrant I.
NOTE: In some cases, it is convenient to place a figure so that it has symmetry with
respect to the y axis, in which case some negative coordinates are present.

position indicated. Because we have freedom of placement, we choose the positioning that
allows the simplest solution for a proof or problem.
EXAMPLE 5
Suppose that you need to make a drawing for the following theorem, which is to be
proved analytically: “The midpoint of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equidistant
from the three vertices of the triangle.” Explain why the placement of right

SOLUTION Refer to Figure 10.23.
a) The choice of vertices causes 
, so the triangle is also an isosceles
triangle. This contradicts point 2 of the list of suggestions.
b) The coordinates are too specific! This contradicts point 1 of the list. A proof
with these coordinates would not establish the general case.
c) The drawing does not make use of horizontal and vertical lines to obtain the
right angle. This violates point 4 of the list.
d) This placement fails point 3 of the list because b is a negative number. The
length of 
would be 
, which could be confusing.
e) This placement fails point 3 because we have not used as many 0 coordinates
as we could have used. As we shall see, it also fails point 5.
f) This placement fails point 2. The triangle is not a right triangle unless 
.
In Example 5, we wanted to place 
in the coordinate system so that we met as
many of the conditions found in the “Strategy” on pages 453 and 454 as possible. Two 
convenient placements are given in Figure 10.24. The triangle in Figure 10.24(b) is 
slightly better than the one in 10.24(a) in that it uses four 0 coordinates rather than 
three. Another advantage of Figure 10.24(b) is that the placement forces angle B to be a
right angle, because the x and y axes are perpendicular.
We now turn our attention to the role of the conclusion of the theorem for the proof.

Three considerations for using the conclusion as a guide:
1. If the conclusion is a conjunction “P and Q,” be sure to verify both parts of the 
conclusion.
2. The following pairings indicate the formulas from Table 10.1 used to prove 
statements of the type shown in the left column.
To prove the conclusion:
Use the:
a) Segments are congruent or have 
Distance Formula
equal lengths (such as 
).
b) Segments are parallel 
Slope Formula (need 
)
(such as 
).
c) Segments are perpendicular 
Slope Formula (need

d) A segment is bisected.

e) Segments bisect each other.
Midpoint Formula

reason backward from the conclusion.

b) By studying the theorem, name at least two of the formulas that will be used
to complete the proof. Explain your choices.
SOLUTION
a) We improve Figure 10.24(b) by giving the value 2a to the x coordinate of A
and the value 2b to the y coordinate of C. (A factor of 2 makes it easier to 
calculate and represent the midpoint M of 
. See Figure 10.25 on page 456.)

b) The Midpoint Formula is applied to describe the midpoint of 
. Using the
formula, we find that
.
So the midpoint of the hypotenuse is (a, b). The Distance Formula will also be
needed because the theorem states that the distances from M to A, from M to
B, and from M to C should all be equal.
The purpose of our next example is to demonstrate efficiency in the labeling of 
vertices. Our goal is to use fewer variables in characterizing the vertices of the parallelo-
gram found in Figure 10.26.
EXAMPLE 7
If MNPQ is a parallelogram in Figure 10.26, find the coordinates of point P in terms
of a, c, and d.
SOLUTION Consider 
in which we refer to point P as (x, y). 
Because 
, we have 
. But 
and
so we are led to the equation
Now P is described by (x, d). Because 
, we are also led to equal slopes
for these segments. But
Then
By using the Means-Extremes Property, we have
(with 
)
(dividing by d)
(adding a)
Therefore, P is the point (

In retrospect, Example 7 shows that 
is characterized by vertices M(0, 0),
, 
, and 
. Because 
and 
are horizontal segments, it is 
obvious that 
. Both 
(starting at M) and 
(starting at N) trace paths that
move along each segment c units to the right and d units upward. Thus, the slopes of 
and 
are both , and it follows that 
.
In Example 7, we named the coordinates of the vertices of a parallelogram with the
fewest possible letters. We now extend our result in Example 7 to allow for a rhombus—
a parallelogram with two congruent adjacent sides.
EXAMPLE 8
In Figure 10.27, find an equation that relates a, c, and d if 
is a rhombus.
SOLUTION As we saw in Example 7, the coordinates of the vertices of ABCD define
a parallelogram. For emphasis, we note that 
and 
because
For Figure 10.27 to represent a rhombus, it is necessary that 
. Now
because 
is a horizontal segment. To find an expression 
for the length of 
, we need to use the Distance Formula.
Because 
, we are led to

desired equation,

If 
in Figure 10.28, find a relationship among the variables a, b, c, and d.
SOLUTION First we find the slopes of lines 
and

For

With

When we use algebra along with the rectangular coordinate system to prove a geometric
theorem, the method of proof is analytic. The analytic (algebraic) approach relies heavily
on the placement of the figure in the coordinate system and on the application of the 
formulas in Table 10.1. In order to contrast analytic proof with synthetic proof (the 
two-column or paragraph proofs used in earlier chapters), we repeat in this section some
earlier theorems and prove these analytically.
In Section 10.3, we saw how to place triangles having special qualities in the coordi-
nate system. We review this information in Table 10.2; in Example 1, we consider the

EXAMPLE 2
Prove the following theorem by the analytic method. See Figure 10.30.
EXS. 5–9
1. Read the theorem carefully to distinguish the hypothesis and the conclusion. The
hypothesis characterizes the figure to use.
2. Use the hypothesis (and nothing more) to determine a convenient placement of 
the figure in the rectangular coordinate system. Then label the figure. See Tables 10.1
and 10.2.
3. If any special quality is provided by the hypothesis, be sure to state this early in the
proof. (For example, a rhombus should be described as a parallelogram that has two
congruent adjacent sides.)
4. Study the conclusion, and devise a plan to prove this claim; this may involve reason-
ing backward from the conclusion step by step until the hypothesis is reached.
5. Write the proof, being careful to order the statements properly and to justify each
statement.
STRATEGY FOR PROOF ■Completing an Analytic Proof
As we did in Example 1, we include a “plan” for Example 2. Although no plan is
shown for Example 3 or Example 4, one is necessary before the proof can be written.
PLAN: Use the Midpoint Formula to show that the two diagonals have a 
common midpoint. Use a factor of 2 in the coordinates of the vertices.
PROOF: With coordinates as shown in Figure 10.30, quadrilateral ABCD is a
parallelogram. The diagonals intersect at point P. By the Midpoint Formula,
we have
Also, the midpoint of 
is
Thus, 
is the common midpoint of the two diagonals and must be the 
point of intersection of 
and 
. Then 
and 
bisect each other at point
.
The proof of Theorem 10.4.2 is not unique! In Section 10.5, we could prove Theorem
10.4.2 by using a three-step proof:
1. Find the equations of the two diagonals.
2. Determine the point of intersection of these lines.
3. Show that this point of intersection is the common midpoint.
But the phrase bisect each other in Theorem 10.4.2 implied the use of the Midpoint
Formula. Our approach to Example 2 was far easier and just as valid as the three steps
described above. The use of the Midpoint Formula is generally the best approach when the
phrase bisect each other appears in the statement of a theorem.
We now outline the method of analytic proof.

In Example 3, we had to use the condition that two adjacent sides of the rhombus were
congruent to complete the proof. Had that condition been omitted, the product of slopes
could not have been shown to equal 
. In general, the diagonals of a parallelogram are
not perpendicular.
In our next example, we consider the proof of the converse of an earlier theorem.
Although it is easy to complete an analytic proof of the statement “The diagonals of a 
rectangle are equal in length,” the proof of the converse is not as straightforward.

Another method for solving a system of equations is geometric and requires graphing.
Solving by graphing amounts to finding the point of intersection of the linear graphs. 
That point is the ordered pair that is the common solution (when one exists) for the two
equations. Notice that Example 8 repeats the system of Example 7. The graphs of the

The graphs are drawn in the same coordinate system. See Figure 10.39. The
point of intersection (4, 1) is the common solution for each of the given equations
and thus is the solution of the system.
NOTE: To verify the result (solution) found in Examples 7 and 8, we show that (4, 1) 
satisfies both of the given equations:
The solution is verified in that both statements are true.
Advantages of the method of solving a system of equations by graphing include the
following:
1. It is easy to understand why a system such as
when we are solving by addition or subtraction. We know that the graphs 
of 
and 
are coincident (the same line) because 
each equation can be changed to the form 
.
2. It is easy to understand why a system such as
has no solution. In Figure 10.40, the graphs of these equations are parallel lines.

The first equation is equivalent to 
, and the second equation 
can be changed to 
Both lines have slope 
, but have 
different y intercepts. Therefore, the lines are parallel and distinct.
Two lines with the same slope and the same y intercept are coincident; otherwise, lines
having the same slope but different y intercepts are parallel.
Algebraic substitution can also be used to solve a system of equations. In our
approach, we write each equation in the form 
and then equate the 
expressions for y. Once the x coordinate of the solution is known, we substitute this value
of x into either equation to find the value of y.

In three-dimensional space (the real world in which we live), an object can be located by
its latitude, longitude, and altitude. In mathematics, we can extend the coordinate system
to include three axes; in this extension, the third axis (the z axis) is perpendicular to the 
xy plane (the Cartesian plane) at the point that is the common origin of all three number
lines (axes). In Figure 10.42, the three axes are mutually perpendicular, meaning that any 
two axes are perpendicular. The three-dimensional coordinate system is known as
Cartesian space; at times, the system will be called the xyz system.

POINTS
Points in the three-dimensional Cartesian system are characterized by ordered triples of the
form 
. While the origin of this system is the point (0, 0, 0), the point (4, 5, 3) has
the x coordinate 4, the y coordinate 5, and the z coordinate 3. To plot the point (4, 5, 3),
we need to know the orientation of the axes. In space, the x axis moves forward and back,
the y axis moves right and left, and the z axis moves up and down. Table 10.2 indicates the
positive and negative directions of the three axes. As shown in Figure 10.43, we use the
same scale on each of the three axes.

LINES
A line is determined by exactly two points in any coordinate system. Because the slope
concept of the two-dimensional Cartesian system is a ratio of two numbers, there is no
slope concept for a line in three dimensions. In Cartesian space, we give direction to a line
by using a direction vector. A direction vector of the form 
provides changes in x,
y, and z (respectively) as we trace movement along the line from one point to another point.

PLANES
In space, a plane is determined by three noncollinear points, two intersecting lines, or two
parallel lines. In space, we first consider planes that are determined by two intersecting
axes. The xy plane that is determined by the intersection of the x and y axes has the equa-
tion 
Determined by two intersecting axes, there is an xz plane (where 
) and a
yz plane (where 
). Where a, b, and c are constants, the planes that are most easily
described are those of the form 
or 
For instance, 
is a plane
that is parallel to and 2 units above the xy plane 
Likewise, 
is a plane
that is parallel to the yz plane 
and 4 units behind it.
There are numerous similarities in the two-dimensional and three-dimensional coor-
dinate systems; however, the graph of the equation for the linear equation 
in two dimensions is a line, while the graph of the linear equation 
is actually a plane. It is still convenient to graph this plane by using intercepts; the x inter-
cept has the form 
and is the point where the graph intersects the x axis. Similarly,
the y intercept has the form 
while the z intercept has the form

LINE AND PLANE RELATIONSHIPS
There are four possible relationships between two lines drawn in Cartesian space. 
First, two lines with different direction vectors will intersect in a point if the x, y, and z
coordinates of the intersecting lines are respectively equal. A second possibility occurs
when two lines neither move in the same direction nor intersect at a point; such lines are
called skew lines. Third, two lines that have the same direction vectors may be parallel
lines; for example 
and 
are
parallel because their direction vectors are multiples and the lines do not have a point

in common. Finally, two lines with direction vectors that are multiples coincide if they 
contain 
a 
common 
point; 
for 
instance, 
and
are known as coincident lines. Next, we illustrate a
method used to determine whether two lines with different direction vectors intersect or
else are skew.
EXAMPLE 7
Decide if 
and 
intersect or are skew. If 
and 
intersect, what is the point of intersection?
SOLUTION If the lines intersect, then there are values of n and r for which a 
point on the lines is identical. Point forms of the lines are
and 
If there is a point of intersection for the two lines, then

(from 
in turn, the points on the lines are 
or 
and
or

Yes, the lines intersect in that the point having the common values for x and y also 
has a common value for z.
Of course, the point of intersection is 
NOTE 1: Equating x and y produced values of n and r that could lead to different z
coordinates for the two lines; in that case, the two lines are necessarily skew lines.
NOTE 2: The system of equations in n and r can be solved by the addition-subtraction
method. If the first and third equations are used to form a system, then a common y
value is sought; using the second and third equations, then a common x value is found.
The four relationships for two lines in Cartesian space are summarized in Table 10.5.

While two planes generally intersect in a line, two planes can be parallel. If two planes
are parallel, the coefficients for their equations will be multiples; however, the resulting
constants will not be multiples. For example, the planes represented by 
and 
are parallel; the graphs will have different intercepts and yet
the same orientation in Cartesian space. When two planes are parallel, they have (or simplify

to) equations that have forms such as 
and 
where 
As with lines, two equations for planes could lead to coincident planes (the same
plane). For example, the graphs of 
and 
are the
same; notice that the second equation is a multiple of the first equation. When one equa-
tion is a multiple of the other, as with 
and 
the
equations are said to be equivalent equations; when graphed, the planes having equivalent
equations will have identical x, y, and z intercepts so that the planes coincide. 
As we saw in Chapter 7, three or more lines that intersect at a common point are said
to be concurrent. Similarly, three or more planes that intersect at a single point are also
known as concurrent planes. 
INTERSECTION OF PLANES
In Cartesian space, finding the line of intersection of two intersecting planes by a visual
(geometric) approach is virtually impossible. Furthermore, the algebraic technique used to
determine the vector equation of the line of intersection is a real challenge. To be complete,
we examine the intersection of two nonparallel planes in Example 8.
EXAMPLE 8 
The intersection of the planes 
and 
is the line given in vector form by 
a) Name a point on the line of intersection.
b) State a direction vector for the line of intersection.
c) Using 
name a second point on the line of intersection. 
d) Show that the point named in the solution for part (a) lies in both planes.
e) Show that the point named in the solution for part (c) lies in both planes.
SOLUTION
a) By its vector equation form, the line of intersection must contain the 
point (0, 6, 0).
b) A direction vector of the line is 
c) With 
a second point is 
or
or 
d) For (0, 6, 0) to be on both planes, it must be a solution for the equation 
of each plane: 
becomes 
or 12, so (0, 6, 0) is a 
solution;
becomes 
or 18, so (0, 6, 0) 
is a solution.
e) Similarly, 
must be a solution for the equation of each plane:
becomes 
or 12, so
is a solution;
becomes 
or 18, so
is a solution.
NOTE: If 
and 
lie on both planes then these two points
determine the line of intersection for the two planes.
As we saw earlier in this section, there is an alternative form for the equation of a line
in three variables. Found by simplification of a real number multiple and addition, it 
provides a form that makes it easier to recognize points on the line.

In Cartesian space, the counterpart of the circle is the sphere. To find the equation for a
sphere, we apply the Distance Formula. Where

length r, the points on the sphere 
must lie at distance r from the center. This 
relationship leads to the equation

THE BANACH-TARSKI PARADOX
In the 1920s, two Polish mathematicians proposed a mathematical
dilemma to their colleagues. Known as the Banach-Tarski para-
dox, their proposal has puzzled students of geometry for decades.
What was most baffling was that the proposal suggested that 
matter could be created through rearrangement of the pieces of a
figure! The following steps outline the Banach-Tarski paradox.
First consider the square whose sides are each of length 8.
[See Figure 10.49(a).] By counting squares or by applying a 
formula, it is clear that the 8-by-8 square must have an area of
64 square units. We now subdivide the square (as shown) to form
two right triangles and two trapezoids. Note the dimensions 
indicated on each piece of the square in Figure 10.49(b).
Figure 10.49
The parts of the square are now rearranged to form a rectan-
gle [see Figure 10.50(a)] whose dimensions are 13 and 5. The 
rectangle redrawn in Figure 10.50(b) clearly has an area that
measures 65 square units, 1 square unit more than the given
square! How is it possible that the second figure has an area
greater than that of the first?
Figure 10.50
The puzzle is real, but you may also sense that something is
wrong. This paradox can be explained by considering the slopes
of lines. The triangles, which have legs of lengths 3 and 8, 
determine a hypotenuse whose slope is 
. Although the side of
the trapezoid appears to be collinear with the hypotenuse, 
it actually has a slope of 
. It was easy to accept that the 
segments were collinear because the slopes are nearly equal; in
fact, 
and 
. In Figure 10.51 (which
is somewhat exaggerated), a very thin parallelogram appears in
the space between the original segments of the cut-up square.
One may quickly
conclude that the
area of that parallel-
ogram is 1 square
unit, and the paradox
has been resolved
once more!

PERSPECTIVE ON APPLICATIONS
THE POINT-OF-DIVISION FORMULAS
The subject of this feature is a generalization of the formulas 
that led to the Midpoint Formula. Recall that the midpoint of 
the line segment that joins A
to B
is given by 
, which is derived from the formulas 
and 
The formulas
for a more general location of a point between A and B follow;
to better understand how these formulas can be applied, we note
that r represents the fractional part of the distance from point A
toward point B on 
; in the Midpoint Formula, 
Table 10.6 clarifies the use of the formulas above.
EXAMPLE 1
Find the point P on 
that is one-third of the distance from
to 
.
SOLUTION
and
and      
Then
Also,
The desired point is 
.
NOTE: See the figure above, in which similar triangles can
be used to explain why point P is the desired point.
In some higher-level courses, the value of r is not restricted
to values between 0 and 1. For instance, we could choose 
or 
. For such values of r, the point P produced by the
Point-of-Division Formulas remains collinear with A and B;
however, the point P that is produced does not lie between A
and B. 
The Point-of-Division Formulas extend to Cartesian space.
That is, the point 
that is part r of the distance from
to 
is given by

A Look Back at Chapter 10
Our goal in this chapter was to relate algebra and geometry. This
relationship is called analytic geometry or coordinate geometry.
Formulas for the distance between points, the midpoint of a line
segment, and the slope of a line were developed. We found the
equation for a line and used it for graphing. Analytic proofs were
provided for a number of theorems of geometry. In the final section,
we extended the Midpoint Formula and the Distance Formula 
to three dimensions; also, we considered the equations of lines,
planes, and spheres.
A Look Ahead to Chapter 11
In the next chapter, we will again deal with the right triangle. Three
trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, and tangent) will be defined for
an acute angle of the right triangle in terms of its sides. An area 
formula for triangles will be derived using the sine ratio. We will
also prove the Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines for acute 
triangles.

Surreal! The Pontusval Lighthouse is located on the rugged 
shoreline of the Bretagne (Brittany) peninsula in northwest France.
As with any lighthouse, it sends a “Welcome” message as well as 
a “Caution” message to the people on board an approaching vessel.
Methods of trigonometry enable the ship captain to determine the 
distance from his or her ship to the rocky shoreline beneath the 
lighthouse. The word trigonometry, which means “the measure of a
triangle,” provides methods for the measurement of parts (sides and
angles) of a triangle. Found in Chapter 11 are some techniques that
enable you to find measures of one part of a right triangle when the
measures of other parts are known. These methods can be expanded
to include techniques for measuring parts of acute triangles as well.
For the applications of this chapter, you will find it necessary to
use a scientific or graphing calculator.

CHAPTER 11 ■INTRODUCTION TO TRIGONOMETRY
Unless otherwise noted, all content on this page is © Cengage Learning.
In this section, we deal exclusively with similar right triangles. In Figure 11.1,
and 
and 
are right angles. Consider corresponding angles A
and D; if we compare the length of the side opposite each angle to the length of the
hypotenuse in each triangle, we obtain this result by the reason CSSTP:
In the two similar right triangles, the ratio of each pair of corresponding sides depends on
the measure of acute 
(or 
, because 
); for each angle, the numerical
value of the ratio
is unique. This ratio becomes smaller for smaller measures of 
and larger for larger
measures of 
. This ratio is unique for each measure of an acute angle even though the
lengths of the sides of the two similar right triangles containing the angle are different.
Figure 11.1
In Figure 11.2, we name the measures of the angles of the right triangle by the Greek
letters 
(alpha) at vertex A, 
(beta) at vertex B, and 
(gamma) at vertex C. The lengths
of the sides opposite vertices A, B, and C are a, b, and c, respectively. Relative to the acute
angle, the lengths of the sides of the right triangle in the following definition are described
as “opposite” and “hypotenuse.” The word opposite is used to mean the length of the side
opposite the angle named; the word hypotenuse is used to mean the length of the
hypotenuse.

Recall the 
relationship, in which the side opposite the 30° angle has a
length equal to one-half that of the hypotenuse; the remaining leg has a length equal to the
product of the length of the shorter leg and 
.

Although the exact value of

, a calculator
would give an approximate value for 
such as 0.8660254. If we round the ratio for
to four decimal places, then 
Use your calculator to show that
as well.
In Example 4, we apply the 
triangle. In this triangle, the legs of the right
triangle are congruent; also, the length of the hypotenuse is 
times the length of 
either leg.
EXAMPLE 4
Find exact and approximate values for sin 45°.
SOLUTION Using the 
triangle in Figure 11.6, we 
see that 
. Equivalently, 
.
In turn, 
.
We will now use the Angle-Bisector Theorem (from Section 5.6) to determine the sine
ratios for angles that measure 15° and 75°. Recall that the bisector of one angle of a 
triangle divides the opposite side into two segments whose lengths are proportional to
those of the sides forming the bisected angle. In Figure 11.5, we bisect the 30° angle 
and choose 
. Using the resulting triangle shown in Figure 11.7, we are led to the 
proportion
Applying the Means-Extremes Property, we have
The number 0.4641 is the length of the side that lies opposite the 15° angle of 
the 15°-75°-90° triangle in Figure 11.8. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can 
show that the length of the hypotenuse is approximately 1.79315. In turn, 
. Using the same triangle, 
.
We now begin to formulate a small table of values of sine ratios. In Table 11.1, the
Greek letter (theta) designates the angle measure in degrees. The second column has the
heading sin 
and provides the ratio for the corresponding angle; this ratio is generally
given to four decimal places of accuracy. Note that the values of sin 
increase as 
increases in measure.

In each right triangle shown in Figure 11.9, 
is an acute angle with a side that is
horizontal. In the figure, note that the length of the hypotenuse is constant—it is always
equal to the length of the radius of the circle. However, the length of the side opposite 
gets larger as 
increases in measure. In fact, as 
approaches 90°
, the length 
of the leg opposite 
approaches the length of the hypotenuse. As

The table or a calculator can also be used to find the measure of an angle. This is 
possible when the sine of the angle is known. Because 
, the following 
statement is true. “The acute angle whose sine ratio is 
measures 
.” To find the 
missing angle measure on a scientific calculator, we would input “inverse sine of .” On the 
graphing calculator, we find the angle’s measure by the input “
of .” The method is
illustrated in Example 7.
EXAMPLE 7
If 
, find 
to the nearest degree by using
a) Table 11.2.
b) a calculator.
SOLUTION
a) Find 0.7986 under the heading sin . Now look to the left to find the degree
measure of the angle in the 
column:
b) On a scientific calculator that is in degree mode, you can use the following
key sequence to find :
⋅→7 →9 →8 →6 →inv →sin →53
The combination “inv” and “sin” yields the angle whose sine ratio is known, 
so 
.
NOTE: On a graphing calculator that is in degree mode, use this sequence:
→
( →⋅→7 →9 →8 →6 →
) →ENTER →53
The calculator function  
is found by pressing  2nd followed by  sin  .
In most application problems, a drawing provides a good deal of information and
affords some insight into the method of solution. For some drawings and applications, the
phrases angle of elevation and angle of depression are used. These angles are measured from
the horizontal as illustrated in Figures 11.11(a) and 11.11(b). In Figure 11.11(a), the angle
measured upward from the horizontal ray is the angle of elevation. In Figure 11.11(b),
the angle 
measured downward from the horizontal ray is the angle of depression.

from the Pythagorean triple 
(5, 12, 13). Consequently,
Just as the sine ratio of any angle is unique, the cosine ratio of any angle is also
unique. Using the 30°-60°-90° and 45°-45°-90° triangles of Figure 11.17, we see that
Now we use the 15°-75°-90° triangle shown in Figure 11.18 to find cos 75°

Use your calculator to verify the results found in Table 11.3.
This textbook does not provide an expanded table of cosine ratios comparable to Table
11.2 for sine ratios. Nonetheless, we can use Table 11.3 or a calculator to find the cosine
ratio of an angle. We illustrate the application of such a table in Example 3.
EXAMPLE 3
Using Table 11.3, find the length of b in Figure 11.20 correct to the nearest tenth.
SOLUTION
from the triangle. Also, 
from the table. Then
(because both equal cos 15°)
Therefore,
when rounded to the nearest tenth of an inch.
In a right triangle, the cosine ratio can often be used to find either an unknown length
or an unknown angle measure. Whereas the sine ratio requires that we use opposite and
hypotenuse, the cosine ratio requires that we use adjacent and hypotenuse.
An equation of the form 
or 
contains three variables; for the 
equation 
, the variables are 
, b, and c. When the values of two of the 
variables are known, the value of the third variable can be determined; however, we must
decide which trigonometric ratio is needed to solve the problem.
In Example 4, we deal with the question, “Should we write an equation containing the
sine or the cosine of the angle measure?”

EXAMPLE 5
Find cos 67° correct to four decimal places by using a calculator.
SOLUTION On a scientific calculator that is in degree mode, use the following key

Using a graphing calculator (in degree mode), follow this key sequence:
cos  →( →6  →7 → ) →ENTER  →    0.3907
That is,

As in Sections 11.1 and 11.2, we again deal exclusively with right triangles in this section.
The next trigonometric ratio that we consider is the tangent ratio, which is defined for an
acute angle of the right triangle by
Like the sine ratio, the tangent ratio increases as the measure of the acute angle increases.
Unlike the sine and cosine ratios, whose values range from 0 to 1, the value of the tangent
ratio is from 0 upward; that is, there is no greatest value for the tangent.

The value of tan

the measure of the acute angle approaches 90°. That the tangent ratio 
becomes 
infinitely large as

(approaching 0) while the numerator increases.
Study Figure 11.26 to see why the value of the tangent of an angle grows immea-
surably large as the angle approaches 90° in size. As the angle grows larger, consider the
value of the ratio

(abbreviated “cot”), secant (abbreviated “sec”), and cosecant (abbreviated “csc”). These
are defined in terms of the right triangle shown in Figure 11.33.

attention to some relationships that we will prove for (and apply with) acute triangles. The
first relationship provides a formula for the area of a triangle in which , , and

This relationship between the lengths of the sides of an acute triangle and the sines of

LAW OF COSINES
The final relationship that we consider is again proved only for an acute triangle. Like the
Law of Sines, this relationship (known as the Law of Cosines) can be used to find unknown
measures in a triangle. The Law of Cosines (which can also be established for obtuse 
triangles in a more advanced course) can be stated in words, “The square of the length of
one side of a triangle equals the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two remaining
sides decreased by twice the product of the lengths of those two sides and the cosine of
their included angle.” See Figure 11.42(a) as you read Theorem 11.4.3.

SKETCH OF PLATO
Plato (428–348 B.C.) was a Greek philosopher who studied under
Socrates in Athens until the time of Socrates’ death. Because his
master had been forced to drink poison, Plato feared for his own
life and left Greece to travel. His journey began around 400 B.C.
and lasted for 12 years, taking Plato to Egypt, Sicily, and Italy,
where he became familiar with the Pythagoreans (see page 381.)
Plato eventually returned to Athens where he formed his own
school, the Academy. Though primarily a philosopher, Plato
held that the study of mathematical reasoning provided the most
perfect training for the mind. So insistent was Plato that his stu-
dents have some background in geometry that he placed a sign
above the door to the Academy that read, “Let no man ignorant
of geometry enter here.”
Plato was the first to insist that all constructions be performed
by using only two instruments, the compass and the straightedge.
Given a line segment of length 1, Plato constructed line segments
of lengths 
, 
and so on. Unlike Archimedes (see page 161),
Plato had no interest in applied mathematics. In fact, Plato’s
methodology was quite strict and required accurate definitions,
precise hypotheses, and logical reasoning. Without doubt, his
methods paved the way for the compilation of geometric knowl-
edge in the form of The Elements by Euclid (see page 112).
Commenting on the life of Plato, Proclus stated that Plato
caused mathematics (and geometry in particular) to make great
advances. At that time, many of the discoveries in mathematics
were made by Plato’s students and by those who studied at the
Academy after the death of Plato. It is ironic that although Plato
was not himself a truly great mathematician, yet he was largely
responsible for its development in his time.

CHAPTER 11 ■INTRODUCTION TO TRIGONOMETRY
PERSPECTIVE ON APPLICATIONS
RADIAN MEASURE OF ANGLES
In much of this textbook, we have considered angle measures
from 0° to 180°. As you study mathematics, you will find that
two things are true:
1. Angle measures used in applications do not have to be
limited to measures from 0° to 180°.
2. The degree is not the only unit used in measuring angles.
We will address the first of these issues in Examples 1, 2, and 3.
EXAMPLE 1
As the time changes from 1 P.M. to 1:45 P.M., through what
angle does the minute hand rotate? See Figure 11.47.
Figure 11.47
SOLUTION Because the rotation is of a complete circle 
(360°), the result is 
or 270°.
EXAMPLE 2
An airplane pilot is instructed 
to circle the control tower twice
during a holding pattern before
receiving clearance to land.
Through what angle does 
the airplane move? See 
Figure 11.48.
SOLUTION Two circular 
rotations give 2(360°) or 720°.
In trigonometry, negative measures for angles are used to 
distinguish the direction of rotation. A counterclockwise rota-
tion is measured as positive, a clockwise rotation as negative.
The arcs with arrows in Figure 11.49 are used to indicate the
direction of rotation.
Figure 11.49
EXAMPLE 3
To tighten a hex bolt, a
mechanic applies clockwise
rotations of 60° several times.
What is the measure of each
rotation? See Figure 11.50.
SOLUTION Tightening occurs if the angle is 
.
NOTE: If the angle of rotation is 60° (that is, 
), 
the bolt is loosened.
Our second concern is with an alternative unit for measur-
ing angles, a unit often used in the study of trigonometry and 
calculus.
In Figure 11.51, the length
of each radius and the inter-
cepted arc are all equal to r.
Thus, the central angle shown
measures 1 radian. A com-
plete rotation about the circle 
corresponds to 360° and to 
.
Thus, the arc length of 1 radius
corresponds to the central angle
measure of 1 rad, and the 
circumference of 
radii cor-
responds to the complete rotation of 
rad.
The angle relationship
found in the preceding
paragraph allows us to
equate 360° and 
radi-
ans. As suggested by
Figure 11.52, there are
approximately 6.28 rad (or
exactly 
radians) about
the circle. The exact result
leads to an important 
relationship.

DEFINITION
In a circle, a radian (rad) is the measure of a central
angle that intercepts an arc whose length is equal to
the radius of the circle.

Review Exercises
A Look Back at Chapter 11
One goal of this chapter was to define the sine, cosine, and tangent
ratios in terms of the sides of a right triangle. We derived a formula
for finding the area of a triangle, given two sides and the included
angle. We also proved the Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines for
acute triangles. Another unit for measuring angles, the radian, was
introduced in the Perspective on Applications section.

ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS
In algebra, we do not define terms such as addition, multiplication, number, positive, and
equality. However, a real number is defined as any number that has a position on the 
number line, as shown in Figure A.1.
Figure A.1
Any real number positioned to the right of another real number is larger than the 
number to its left. For example, 4 is larger than 
; equivalently, 
is less than 4 (smaller
numbers are to the left). Numbers such as 3 and 
are opposites or additive inverses.
Two numerical expressions are equal if and only if they have the same value; for example,
. The axioms of equality are listed in the following box; they are also listed in
Section 1.6.

AXIOMS OF EQUALITY
Reflexive 
: Any number equals itself.
Symmetric (if 
, then 
): Two equal numbers are equal in either order.
Transitive (if 
and 
, then 
): If a first number equals a second number and
the second number equals a third number, then the first number equals the third number.
Substitution: If one numerical expression equals a second, then it may replace the second.

To add two real numbers, think of positive numbers as gains and negative numbers as
losses. For instance, 
represents the result of combining a gain of $13 with a
loss (or debt) of $5; because the outcome is a gain of $8, we have
The answer in addition is the sum. Three more examples of addition are
.
If you multiply two real numbers, the product (answer) will be positive if the two
numbers have the same sign, negative if the two numbers have different signs, and 0 if
either number is 0 or both numbers are 0.

FORMULAS AND EQUATIONS
A variable is a letter used to represent an unknown number. However, the number 
represented by the Greek letter 
is known as a constant because it always equals the same
number (approximately 3.14); in reality, any real number, such as 5, 
, or 
, is a 
constant. Although we often use x, y, and z as variables, it is convenient to choose r to 
represent the measure of a radius, h for the measure of height, b for the measure of a base,
and so on.

APPENDIX A ■ALGEBRA REVIEW
EXAMPLE 1
For Figure A.2, combine like terms to find the perimeter P (sum of the lengths of all
sides) of the figure.
SOLUTION
When the FOIL method is used with variable expressions, we combine like terms in
the simplification.
EXAMPLE 2
Find a simplified expression for the product 
SOLUTION
In Example 2, we multiplied by the FOIL method before adding like terms in 
accordance with rules of order. When evaluating a variable expression, we must also 
follow that order. For instance, the value of 
when 
and 
is given by
because exponential expressions represent multiplications and so must be simplified
before addition occurs.

An equation is a statement that equates two expressions. Although formulas are 
special types of equations, most equations are not formulas. Consider the following four
examples of equations:
(a formula)
The phrase solving an equation means finding the values of the variable that make the
equation true when the variable is replaced by those values. These values are known as
solutions for the equation. For example, 3 is a solution (in fact, the only solution) for the
equation 
because 
is true.
When each side of an equation is transformed (changed) without having its solution(s)
changed, we say that an equivalent equation is produced. Some of the properties used to
produce equivalent equations when solving an equation are listed in the following box.

division. In problems that involve equation solving, we will utilize inverse operations, as
suggested in the following box.

the equation with 5, we confirm this as shown:
An equation that can be written in the form

a linear equation. Our plan for solving such an equation involves getting variable terms
together on one side of the equation and numerical terms together on the other side.

INEQUALITIES
In geometry, we sometimes need to work with inequalities. Inequalities are statements
that involve one of the following relationships:
 means “is less than”
	 means “is greater than”

 means “is less than or equal to”
 means “is greater than or equal to”
 means “is not equal to”
The statement 
is true because negative 4 is less than positive 7. On a horizontal
number line, the smaller number is always found to the left of the larger number. An 
equivalent claim is 
which means positive 7 is greater than negative 4. See the
number line at the top of page 541.

Find, if possible, the following:
a) Any number a for which “
” is true.
b) Any numbers a and b for which “
and 
” is true.
SOLUTION
a) There is no such number. If 
then 
for some positive 
number p. Subtracting a from each side of the equation gives 
. 
This statement 
contradicts the fact that p is positive.
b) There are no such numbers. If 
then a is to the left of b on the number
line. Therefore, 
is false, because this statement claims that b is to the 
left of a.
Part (b) of Example 2 suggests the following property.
b  a
a  b,
(p  0)
p  0
a  p  a

means that x is to the left of y, as in Figure A.6. Similarly, 
(equivalently, 
) means that z is to the left of x. With z to the left of x, which
is itself to the left of y, we clearly have z to the left of y; thus

TRANSITIVE PROPERTY OF INEQUALITY
For numbers a, b, and c, if 
and 
, then a  c.
b  c
a  b
This property can be proved as follows:
1.
means that 
for some positive number 
2.
means that 
for some positive number 
3. Substituting 
for b (from statement 1) into the statement 
, 
we have 
.
4. Now 
.
5. But the sum of two positive numbers is also positive; that is, 
so statement 4 becomes 
.
6. If 
, then 
, by the definition of “is less than.”
Therefore, 
and 
implies that 
.
The Transitive Property of Inequality can be extended to four or more unequal 
expressions. When a first value is less than a second, the second is less than a third, and so
on, then the first is less than the last.
EXAMPLE 4
Two angles are complementary if the sum of their measures is exactly 90°. If the 
measure of the first of two complementary angles is more than 27°, what must you 
conclude about the measure of the second angle?
SOLUTION
Where
is the first angle, 
it follows that 
Also,
By substitution,
By definition, the measure of the second angle must be less than 63.

FACTORING AND QUADRATIC EQUATIONS 
In many geometry applications, it is necessary to use the techniques found in this 
appendix in order to solve such problems. Factoring is the procedure in which a 
polynomial is replaced by an indicated product of multipliers (factors). Because FOIL 
can be used to replace the product of 
and 
by 
, we fac-
tor 
by replacing it with the factored form 
.
THE GREATEST COMMON FACTOR
Just as 
equals 
, we factor 
as 
by using the
Distributive Property. The individual terms of 
can be written as follows:
and  
.
With common factors of 5 and x for the terms of the polynomial 
, the greatest
common factor (GCF) for 
is

THE DIFFERENCE OF TWO SQUARES
For apparent reasons, expressions such as 
and 
are each known as a 
difference of two squares. Because

this difference of two squares as follows:

A.4 ■Factoring and Quadratic Equations
547
QUADRATIC TRINOMIALS
Consider the following multiplications, each completed by the FOIL method:
Each result, such as 
, is known as a quadratic trinomial because it has
three terms (a trinomial), of which the largest exponent is two (a quadratic term). For 
quadratic trinomials, sign combinations of the terms are most important; for instance, the
trinomial 
has only positive terms due to the multiplication of two sums.
Each multiplication shown above can be reversed; that is, each quadratic trinomial shown
above at the right can be factored. A polynomial like 
cannot be factored and
is said to be prime. 
Factoring 
would require factors that are a sum and a difference; 
that is, we know that 
has the form 
. Of course, the final
term being numerically 21 suggests that question marks be replaced with 1 and 21 or 
else 3 and 7. FOIL can be used to eliminate the possible choice of 1 and 21; however, 
one must be cautious in that the factored form of 
is 
, 
not 
. Factors can be reversed; for instance, 
equals
Multiplication (using FOIL) verifies that 
or
is equal to 
.
EXAMPLE 3

error, we test combinations that lead to the last term 32, namely 
,

Now

b) The factored form of

in turn, 
c) The factored form of

d) The terms of

Then 
or 
NOTE: In part d), we say that the quadratic trinomial is factored completely.
The terms of the quadratic trinomial 
have no GCF other than 1. 
In the quadratic trinomial 
, the leading term suggests that the factors 
have a form like 
or 
or 
or
. The final term of 
also suggests that we need to 
consider numerical factors of 20. With some experimentation (trial and error), we find 
that 
.
When factoring a polynomial, always look first for a common factor (the GCF) for 
its terms. Factoring 
is fairly easy when we realize the existence of 
the GCF of 6. Otherwise, we have to consider lead factors that produce 
and numerical
factors of 18. The correct factorization of

A.4 ■Factoring and Quadratic Equations
549
If you were asked to use factoring to solve the quadratic equation
,
it would be necessary to change the equation so that one side would be equal to 0. The
form 
is the standard form of a quadratic equation.
ax2  bx  c  0
6x2  7x  3
SOLVING A QUADRATIC EQUATION BY THE FACTORING METHOD
1. Be sure the equation is in standard form (one side
).
2. Factor the polynomial side of the equation.
3. Set each factor containing the variable equal to 0.
4. Solve each equation found in step 3.
5. Check solutions by substituting into the original equation.

Step 5, which was shown in Example 5, is omitted in Example 6.

Therefore, 
is the solution set.
In some instances, a common factor can be extracted from each term in the factoring
step. In the equation 
, the left side of the equation has the common
factor 2. Factoring leads to 
and then to 
. Of
course, only the factors containing variables can equal 0, so the solutions to this equation
are 
and 3.
Equations such as 
and 
are incomplete quadratic equations
because one term is missing from the standard form. Either equation can be solved by 
factoring; in particular, the factoring is given by

THE QUADRATIC FORMULA AND SQUARE ROOT
PROPERTIES
When 
cannot be solved by factoring, solutions may be determined by
the following formula. In the formula, a is the number multiplied by 
, b is the number
multiplied by x, and c is the constant term. The
symbol tells us that there are generally
two solutions, one found by adding and one found by subtracting. The symbol 
is read
“the square root of a.”

Just as fractions are reduced to lower terms

When simplifying a square root, we replace the radicand by a product in which the largest
possible number (from the list of perfect squares below) is selected as one of the factors:
4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, . . .
For example,
The radicand has now been reduced from 45 to 5. Using a calculator, we see that

The expression 
may be prime (meaning “not factorable”). Because
is prime, we solve the equation

Quadratic Formula

23. (a) The
measure of an arc equals the measure of its corresponding central
angle. Therefore, congruent arcs have congruent central angles.
(b) The measure of a central angle equals the measure of its 
intercepted arc. Therefore, congruent central angles have 
congruent arcs. (c) Draw the radii to the endpoints of the 
congruent chords. The two triangles formed are congruent by
SSS. The central angles of each triangle are congruent by
CPCTC. Therefore, the arcs corresponding to the central angles
are also congruent. Hence, congruent chords have congruent arcs.
(d) Draw the four radii to the endpoints of the congruent arcs.
Also draw the chords corresponding to the congruent arcs. The
central angles corresponding to the congruent arcs are also 
congruent. Therefore, the triangles are congruent by SAS. The
chords are congruent by CPCTC. Hence, congruent arcs have con-
gruent chords. (e) Congruent central angles have congruent arcs
(from b). Congruent arcs have congruent chords (from d). Hence,
congruent central angles have congruent chords.
(f) Congruent chords have congruent arcs (from c). Congruent
arcs have congruent central angles (from a). Therefore, congruent
chords have congruent central angles.
