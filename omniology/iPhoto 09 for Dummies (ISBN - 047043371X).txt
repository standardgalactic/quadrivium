About the Author
Angelo Micheletti has had a lifelong passion for photography, starting out 
with a Kodak Brownie 8mm camera as a youth and graduating to a 4 x 5 
camera with a digital back as his skills and interests progressed. The owner 
of Scenes From The West (www.scenesfromthewest.com), Angelo com-
bines his love of photography with an easy-to-understand writing style and 
a devotion to the Mac since its inception in 1984 to produce well-received 
lectures, Apple Macintosh training courses, and books.
With an MBA from St. Mary’s College in California, Angelo currently resides in 
Bend, Oregon.
Dedication
This book is dedicated to my family, who gave me encouragement and sup-
port throughout this endeavor; and especially to my dad, who taught me 
from an early age the joy and magic of photography. And to all my friends 
who offered, countless times, to review portions of the book and give me 
feedback, I offer my wholehearted thanks.
Author’s Acknowledgments
First of all, I want to thank Carole McClendon, my agent, for thinking of me as 
the perfect author for this book and for her guidance throughout the process.
Thanks go to my excellent Project Editor, Blair Pottenger, for his suggestions 
and advice; to Acquisitions Editor Kyle Looper for many productive and enjoy-
able discussions; to Senior Copy Editor Teresa Artman and Copy Editor Heidi 
Unger for their timely and helpful comments and corrections, to Technical 
Editor Dennis Cohen for his insight and editing skill, and to the entire Wiley 
Publishing production team for their professionalism.
Finally, I want to thank all the nuns (many of them posthumously) at 
Bellarmine-Jefferson High School who taught me the love of art and writing 
that I’ve built on throughout my life and who gave me an appreciation for the 
fact that learning is a lifetime occupation.

iPhoto ‘09 For Dummies 

Introduction
G
ot photos? Better yet, want to make your photos (past, present, and 
future) better? Then you’ve come to the right place.
You have the iPhoto software and a Macintosh, and you’ve probably already 
tried out your camera and have a few photos, maybe quite a few. Taking pho-
tographs is lots of fun, and you want to ensure that the ones you take are the 
best they can be. After all, they’re treasured moments you want to preserve 
and share.
My goal is to make you a better photographer, regardless of the camera 
equipment you use or your photographic experience, by using iPhoto ’09. 
And you’re going to have fun doing it.
About This Book
In this book, I show you how to reach your goals — to make your photos the 
best that they can be. A number of key areas are discussed, including
 
✓ The power and capabilities of iPhoto ’09
 
✓ Taking your photos from input, through editing, to final image
 
✓ Editing tricks to enhance your photographic capabilities
 
✓ Printing and electronic sharing
 
✓ Creating photo albums, calendars, cards, and slideshows
Along the way, I’ll also give you some techniques to apply before you ever 
press the camera shutter. They’ll improve your ability to capture what you 
see through the lens and enhance the outcome of using iPhoto ’09’s powerful 
toolset.
If you can, take this book with you when you’re out photographing your 
favorite subjects. Although not written as a broad digital photography guide, 
it’s a handy reference and is full of information that will make your photo-
graphic excursions even more enjoyable and rewarding.

2
iPhoto ’09 For Dummies 
Foolish Assumptions
I tried to make as few assumptions as possible about you, the reader. 
However, there are some which are inescapable. I assume that
 
✓ You have a Mac and iPhoto (part of the iLife suite).
 
✓ You’re familiar with using a Mac: specifically, that you know how to use 
menus, dialogs, and windows; that you can open, close, and copy files; 
and that you know how to navigate the Mac environment.
 
✓ You have information on your camera’s operation. If an operation with 
the camera is required, you know how to do it or can look it up.
 
✓ You’re using iPhoto ’09, for which this book is written. This is the latest 
version available at the time of writing. Although some capabilities that 
are described will work in multiple versions of the software, others 
might not.
Conventions Used in This Book
Before you begin your iPhoto adventure, I need to discuss how information 
will be presented to you in this book. Although pictures are worth a thou-
sand words, it’s the words and symbols presented in this book that convey a 
great deal of information — if you know what you’re looking at.
 
✓ Because this software runs on only a Mac, there are no PC conven-
tions to discuss. For the Mac, the primary shortcut keys used are the 
Command (Ô), the Option key, and the Control key. At times, the Shift 
key will also be used. These keys are used in conjunction with other 
keys as shortcuts for menu selections and invoking various tools and 
commands.
 
 For instance, when you wish to initiate the Print sequence for your 
photo, there is usually a button in a window labeled Print that you can 
click. Or, you can select the Print command from the File menu or use a 
keyboard shortcut (Ô+P). Just remember that any shortcut requires you 
to hold down all the keys except the last one; then press the last key to 
make the shortcut work.
 
✓ Menu commands are given in the order in which you select them: for 
example, “Choose File➪Import to Library.”
 
✓ Options in dialogs use initial caps even if they aren’t capitalized on 
your screen to make it easier to identify them in sentences. For example, 
what appears as Check for iPhoto updates automatically in 
a dialog will appear as Check for iPhoto Updates Automatically in this 
book.

3
 Introduction
 
✓ Web site addresses appear like this: www.scenesfromthewest.com.
 
✓ Context menus are also used from time to time in this book. They 
appear at your cursor’s position when you right-click (or for those with 
a one button mouse, Control-click) your mouse.
 
✓ I included some information that is somewhat technical. This informa-
tion is presented in the book’s sidebars. Although this information isn’t 
absolutely required reading, I recommend you give it a quick look and 
decide for yourself whether to read it. It’s all relevant and will enrich 
your photographic experience.
How This Book Is Organized
This book contains five major parts, each of which is divided into chapters. 
Each chapter is then divided into smaller pieces to help you quickly find the 
information you’re looking for.
The book covers a logical progression of subjects, and I encourage you to 
take advantage of all the information available. That being said, I’ve written 
this book so that you can read any section without necessarily knowing what 
was covered in previous sections. If you just want to look up a particular sub-
ject, find the chapter you need and go there.
Here’s a breakdown of the parts of this book and what you’ll find there.
Part I: Getting Ready to Roll with iPhoto ’09
Part I opens with Chapter 1, familiarizing you with the iPhoto ’09 interface, 
discovering where things are, how to move between the various modes of 
operation, and checking out the technical specifications of the iPhoto soft-
ware. Chapter 2 gets you using the software by completing a simple iPhoto 
project, practicing photo importing, simple editing procedures (including 
cropping and straightening), and printing your first photo. You can download 
the example photo used for the simple project in Chapter 2 from the book’s 
companion Web site at www.dummies.com/go/iphotofd.
You can begin making the software preferences for iPhoto reflect your own 
preferences and spend time understanding the import process in detail, 
including connecting your camera or flash card to your computer, in 
Chapter 3.

iPhoto ’09 For Dummies 
Part II: Manipulating Photo Organization
Organizing is something you know you should do but often don’t.
Part III introduces you to the iPhoto tools that produce a well-organized and 
maintainable archive for your photo collection. Chapter 4 helps you group 
photos by the event they represent — or, thanks to iPhoto’s new facial rec-
ognition and GPS technology, uses the Faces and Places features for grouping 
photos based on the people in them or the location where they were cap-
tured. Chapter 5 covers creating Albums, including Smart Albums for having 
iPhoto automatically organize types of photos in one place. Chapter 6 pro-
vides all you need to know about searching so you can find that favorite shot 
taken at your recent anniversary celebration.
Part III: Making Your Photos Look Even Better
In these four chapters, you can expand your depth of knowledge about the 
iPhoto editing process. Chapter 7 introduces you to the iPhoto Editor. Then, 
in Chapter 8, you effectively deal with what I call the usual suspects: photos 
that are too light or too dark, red eye, and spots or imperfections in the 
photo.
You see the heart of the editing process, including a concise but useful dis-
cussion of the histogram, its meaning, and uses, in Chapter 9. In Chapter 10, 
take advantage of the advanced editing functions available in the Adjust tool 
in which you can work with the histogram to correct exposure, contrast, 
highlights, shadows, and saturation, as well as sharpening and noise removal. 
You also try out some of the wonderful effects you can create with the simple 
click of a button and also see how to save the corrections you have made so 
they can be easily duplicated on other photos.
Part IV: Showing and Sharing Your Photos
It’s only natural to want to share your photos with others, and in this part, 
you’ll explore the many ways to do that.
You can send e-mails to your friends and relatives, burn photos onto CDs 
and DVDs, and — if you have the MobileMe service — exhibit your photos in 
your own Gallery. You can even send your photos directly to Facebook and 
Flickr, which are two popular social networking sites. All this is covered in 
Chapter 11.
Of course, another way to share is by printing your photos, and that’s what 
Chapter 12 is all about. You’ll see the entire process, from selecting borders, 
layouts, and backgrounds to choosing the correct printer settings. But just 

5
 Introduction
making a print isn’t the only way to share a hard copy of your photo. In 
Chapter 13, I show you how to create a photo book (including travel maps 
showing the location of your photos), a calendar (replete with your photos), 
cards containing your favorite vacation shots, and even a slideshow set to 
music.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Traditionally, the last part of a For Dummies book is its Part of Tens, 
whose chapters each contain . . . you guessed it, ten items. This book is 
no exception.
In Chapter 14, I identify and describe ten terrific Web resources and software 
add-ons that can help make your experience with iPhoto even more reward-
ing. Chapter 15 presents ten helpful hints, tips, and shortcuts, all aimed at 
making iPhoto even more powerful in your hands.
What to Read First
I didn’t write this book expecting you to sit down and read it through, cover 
to cover, in one sitting (although you can do that if you like). It’s written and 
arranged to provide both thorough and practical knowledge of iPhoto and to 
be a source for finding quick solutions to immediate photographic problems 
and questions.
To some extent, what you read first will depend on your experience with 
iPhoto. If you’re familiar with the layout, menus, and functionality, you can 
start with Chapter 2 and become involved with an actual iPhoto project.
If you’ve been using iPhoto for some time and just want to get help with 
advanced editing tools and techniques, you can go to Chapter 7 and start 
there.
To explore sharing photos electronically or in print, go to Chapters 11 and 12, 
respectively.
The book is ordered in a way I think makes sense, but each chapter stands on 
its own as much as possible. That said, you might have to go to other chap-
ters from time to time to review the basis for a particular tool or technique 
being discussed.

iPhoto ’09 For Dummies 
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book are icons that appear in the left margin that provide 
extra and often vital information regarding the topic at hand. Here’s what the 
ones I use in the book look like and mean:
 
These shortcuts and ideas can help you make better photographs or keep 
you from doing extra work. They’re often undocumented operations that I 
discovered during my years as a professional photographer and want to 
pass on.
 
These nuggets are reminders of what not to do, or at least what will happen if 
you do perform an action. They might not always be detrimental actions, but 
you should at least slow down and tread lightly.
 
Information denoted with this icon reinforces information that you need to 
retain. For these topics, it’s going to be important later.
 
This is material that you don’t have to read, but I can assure you it’s at least 
interesting and certainly informative. This can vary from information about 
camera formats and what they mean to how the camera and the eye see 
things very differently and how that can affect your photos.
I’ll do my best to give you all the tools and information needed to enhance 
your photographic skills and enjoy photography to the fullest. The rest, as 
they say, is up to you.

efore you dig into the many capabilities and 
sheer fun of iPhoto ’09, it’s important that 
you have a good understanding of what tools you 
have available and how you can use them.
Chapter 1 gives you an overview of the iPhoto ’09 
interface. After all, it’s difﬁ cult to use the technol-
ogy if you’re not sure where to ﬁ nd the controls 
and which initial choices you can make. This 
chapter provides an easy introduction meant to 
make you comfortable in the iPhoto environment.
But all the information in Chapter 1 isn’t going to 
make you proﬁ cient in using the software — you 
need to get your feet wet, so to speak, and that’s 
what Chapter 2 is all about. When you understand 
the essentials, you get to work using that knowl-
edge on a simple iPhoto project. Nothing difﬁ cult, 
but it’s complete enough to show you how to use 
your newly found knowledge.
With some comfort in the operation of iPhoto, it’s 
time to start getting your own photos into the 
iPhoto Library. Chapter 3 covers importing your 
photos from a variety of sources — and, equally 
important, adding information to those photos 
that will make them easier to ﬁ nd and use later on.

A
long with your Mac and all the other software you received or have 
purchased for it is the software that’s the subject of this book — 
iPhoto ’09.
Having been a photo enthusiast for many years using film and standard meth-
ods for developing and printing, you can imagine my curiosity, wonder, and 
finally, pure joy when digital photography arrived on the scene. No 
more running out of film or having the wrong kind. No more 
taking photo after photo trying to ensure I got the shot 
only to discover, after developing the film, that I still 
didn’t get it.
As wondrous as digital photography is, there 
are still plenty of things for mere mortals to do 
with it — and iPhoto ’09 gives you the power to 
do them.
In this chapter, I help you discover how to 
harness that power.
iPhoto — The Big Picture
I believe it’s a good thing when those who might describe 
themselves as amateurs get to use tools that approach pro-
fessional status. iPhoto ’09 is just such a tool. The trick isn’t in 
bringing more and more technology to bear and deal with; it’s bringing in 
more and more technology while keeping the software’s operation at a level 
best described as easy to understand and easy to use.

10
Part I: Getting Ready to Roll with iPhoto ’09 
I’m amazed at how Apple improved iPhoto. Professional photographers are 
expected to think of things like saving photos to ensure that they’re safe, 
but iPhoto does that for you. And it offers a simple tool for backing them up. 
When you import your photos into its Library, the original photo files are 
placed on your hard drive. iPhoto then uses nondestructive editing; as you 
work on the photos, any edits you make to the photos are kept as lists of 
operations that iPhoto applies to the original photo files in the Library. The 
lists of edits are applied to the photos when you view them onscreen or print 
them, but the original photo files in the Library aren’t changed — wonderful!
Facial recognition capabilities and geotagging (attaching geographical loca-
tions) aren’t the kinds of things you’d expect at this level, yet they’re present 
in iPhoto. iPhoto has tools within the editing environment that rival those in 
far more expensive photographic software, and it possesses photo effects 
that can make the user look like a graphics genius.
iPhoto ’09 also gives you an incredible number of ways to share the photos 
you’re so proud of. Of course, making prints is a snap. What knocks your 
socks off are the abilities to easily use the major social networking sites on 
the Internet to display your masterpieces. And turning your art into books, 
calendars, and greeting cards has never been easier. As I write this book, 
I find myself stuck making slideshows, not because they’re difficult but 
because I’m having so much fun — syncing music to slideshows has never 
been easier, and the results are truly outstanding.
Enough with the gushing; time to see how this amazing piece of software 
does its stuff.
Looking at What iPhoto Can Do
One of the biggest selling points for iPhoto ’09 isn’t really a feature at all. 
It’s the clever, consistent, and comprehensive way it leads you through the 
proper steps, in the correct sequence, to ensure that your photos are as 
professional-looking as they can be (and safe from harmful actions — even 
yours!)
So why spend hours in a classroom trying to understand the best work-
flow for photography? Just use iPhoto and this book, and you’ll get all the 
answers.
You do the majority of iPhoto work in these four main areas:
 
✓ Organizing: This is a part of photography that everyone tends to put 
off until “some other day.” That tends to make particular photos, like 
the only time Aunt Sarah ever smiled on camera, very difficult — if not 
impossible — to find. iPhoto can help you organize the photos that 

11
 Chapter 1: Presenting the iPhoto’09 Interface
you’ve already taken and make organizing new photos incredibly easy 
and more automatic.
 
✓ Editing: Any camera is capable of taking a good photograph, and if you 
use good photographic techniques, the outcome is a good photo. If 
everything is perfect in that 1/100th of a second when the camera shut-
ter is open, there’s no need for editing. Alas, in this imperfect world, that 
rarely happens. iPhoto provides a powerful and easy-to-use edit function 
that makes up for many imperfections.
 
✓ Displaying: It’s only natural for you to want to share your photo-
graphic triumphs with family and friends, and iPhoto helps here as 
well. Whether it’s e-mailing Uncle Richard with photos of the new baby, 
putting those photos in a Shared folder so those you tell can download 
them, or placing those photos in your Gallery on the Web, iPhoto makes 
displaying photographs easy and safe.
 
✓ Printing: At the mention of that word, some of you might flash back to 
thoughts of being in a darkroom manipulating images on paper, sur-
rounded by chemicals that smelled bad and could be dangerous. Banish 
those thoughts. Digital printing is a joy, and iPhoto takes you through 
the entire process, with tools and choices you can use to produce first-
class prints.
The sections that follow take a look at these four areas, as well as where the 
controls are located in the iPhoto interface. With a little practice, using the 
iPhoto buttons, panes, and controls becomes second nature.
Organizing in iPhoto
I’m sure we’ve all had instances in our lives where we know something exists, 
but we have no idea where it is or how to find it. And, no, I’m not talking about 
“senior moments.” It happens to everyone because of the sheer volume of 
things we deal with in this modern world.
Nowhere is it more true than in our collection of photographs. We’ve all had 
a particular photo we wanted to show someone but couldn’t for the life of us 
remember where it was. In the digital era, we aren’t limited by running out of 
film, so the number of photos we take can be astronomical. Organizing is key 
to sanity. Luckily, iPhoto gives us some choices that are truly amazing.
iPhoto provides several ways to organize according to your preferences.
 
✓ Events: The key to organizing in iPhoto is an Event. An Event can be any 
grouping or an occasion, such as a particular date or a birthday. As an 
example, Figure 1-1 shows a five-photo Event that was grouped by date. 
You could also group these photos by subject — say, in an Event called 
House Shots. There are lots of options, so be sure to read Chapter 4 for 
more details.

12
Part I: Getting Ready to Roll with iPhoto ’09 
 
 
Figure 1-1: Event photos grouped by date.
 
✓ Albums: Suppose you want to take some photos from several Events 
and group them, under a subject or theme, while still leaving them in 
their original Events. That’s where Albums come in. You can choose 
any photos from any number of Events (usually they have something 
in common) and put them in an Album whose name suggests the com-
monality. The Event groups remain unchanged. You can even use Smart 
Albums, which select their photos based on conditions you can set for 
them. Any photo matching those conditions is automatically put in that 
Smart Album. I tell you much more about Albums and Smart Albums in 
Chapter 5.
 
✓ Folders: Taking organization one step further, suppose that you created 
several Albums that have a similar subject or theme. You can put all 
the Albums in a folder. For instance, if you have several Birthday Party 
Albums covering several years, you can put them all into a folder named 
Birthdays, making all these Albums easy to find.

13
 Chapter 1: Presenting the iPhoto’09 Interface
 
✓ Faces: No, it’s not about making faces — it’s about recognizing them. 
It almost sounds like science fiction, but it’s a wonderful new part of 
iPhoto. The software recognizes that one or more faces are in a photo, 
outlines them, and asks you to name them. It then finds more photos 
that it thinks match the person, and you can confirm or deny the match. 
Now you can quickly find all the photos of Grandpa Pete, regardless of 
when you took them or where they might be in the Library. Neat, huh?
 
✓ Places: If your camera puts GPS information into your photos, you can 
use the new iPhoto Places feature to keep track of it. And with a little 
help from you, iPhoto provides maps that contain pins marking the loca-
tion of each photo. There’s even a Location browser that lets you search 
for photos by location. You can also enter location information manually 
even if your camera doesn’t. I show you how in Chapter 3. Good stuff.
Editing in iPhoto
Of the many great things to like about iPhoto, to me, its greatest plus is non-
destructive editing. Simply put, the original photo in the iPhoto Library is 
never changed. Behind the scenes, iPhoto keeps track of all your edits for 
a photo and applies them whenever you want to view, edit, or publish the 
photo. Amazing, isn’t it?
 
When you edit, iPhoto compiles an edit list of all the changes you make to a 
photo. Later, when you re-open the photo, the original has all the items in the 
edit list applied to it again, to get you back where you left off. You can now 
make further edits — or, lo and behold! — revert to the original photo if you 
decide you’re going down the wrong path.
And the tools available for editing are impressive, too.
 
✓ Rotate: Need to turn a photo in 90° increments? This tool is made just 
for that.
 
✓ Crop: Want to enhance the look of a photo? Sometimes, it just requires 
removing things that are distracting, and that’s what using the Crop tool 
does.
 
✓ Straighten: Held the camera a little crooked when you took the picture, 
did you? No matter — it’s easy to straighten things out by using the 
Straighten tool and moving a slider.
 
✓ Enhance: This is the tool to use to quickly adjust brightness and 
contrast.
 
✓ Red-Eye: You’ll have no more photos of people with ghoulish looks 
when you use the Red-Eye tool in iPhoto.
 
✓ Retouch: You’ll love this very effective blemish-remover tool.

14
Part I: Getting Ready to Roll with iPhoto ’09 
 
✓ Effects: Use the Effects tool and check out how your photo looks with 
different toning and viewing effects.
 
✓ Adjust: This tool provides multiple adjustments for light and color that 
really make your photos sparkle.
Discover more about these editing capabilities in Chapters 8, 9, and 10.
Displaying in iPhoto
You can show off your artistic side by displaying your photos in a number 
of ways. iPhoto not only helps prepare your photos to look their best, but 
it also assists you in letting others share in your joy. All the details are in 
Chapter 11. Some of the displaying possibilities are
 
✓ E-mail attachments: This sharing method is probably the most common 
way to send out photos. iPhoto has a quick and easy-to-use interface to 
take your photos from the iPhoto Library into your e-mail client.
 
✓ CDs and DVDs: A great way to share, CDs and DVD are also excellent 
media for backing up your photos.
 
✓ On your Web site: Want to provide world-wide access to your photos? 
Whether you’re using the iPhoto interface with iWeb or creating a Web 
page that you can send to a Web server, iPhoto can help you create your 
own Web site for sharing photos.
 
✓ MobileMe: Apple’s service that can synch files on your computer is also 
a fantastic platform for sharing your photos. You can create your own 
Gallery on MobileMe, uploading directly from iPhoto. You can allow 
others to download your photos or add some of their own, and they can 
access your Gallery via the Web.
 
✓ Facebook and Flickr: You can upload photos to two of the most popular 
social networking sites directly from iPhoto. Publish to either of them 
with the click of a button.
Printing in iPhoto
One popular way to share your photos is by printing them for framing, greet-
ing cards, and calendars. iPhoto has a rich assortment of choices when 
printing a hard copy is the way you want to go. Chapters 12 and 13 provide 
the details about all the wonderful printing possibilities. Some of the choices 
you’ll find are
 
✓ Printing photos yourself: A large number of photo printers are on the 
market for home use, with quite a price and performance range. Make 
sure that any printer you purchase is compatible with Macs (most of 
them are) and try to get the best value for your money. After all the hard 

15
 Chapter 1: Presenting the iPhoto’09 Interface
work you put into your photos, you don’t want to shortchange yourself 
on the print.
 
✓ Ordering photo books and prints: You can use a service available 
through iPhoto to order a professional, bound book filled with your 
photographs.
 
✓ Turning your photos into greeting cards: iPhoto gives you a choice of 
several greeting card sizes and styles for just about any occasion. Just 
drag your photo into the card format, add your message, and then either 
print it yourself or send it out directly from iPhoto for professional 
production.
 
✓ Creating a calendar with your photos: This can be a great birthday 
or holiday gift. Choose a theme and then begin customizing. You can 
choose the month the calendar begins, the number of months (up to 24), 
and which holidays you want to appear. Then just drag in your photos, 
add or change special dates as you wish, and you’re done. You can 
order a professionally printed calendar or print it yourself, all through 
iPhoto.
iPhoto’s Technical Specifications
iPhoto is very easy to use and gives you wide latitude in how you accomplish 
your photographic goals. Like with all things in life, you need to have some 
items in order to use even this very forgiving application. Here’s a list:
 
✓ A compatible digital camera: Although, strictly speaking, a camera isn’t 
required to import photos into iPhoto, you’re going to want one if you 
intend to do much in the way of photography. I cover the various ways 
for importing photos into iPhoto in Chapter 3.
 
✓ A Mac with Mac OS X and iPhoto: This requirement kind of goes with-
out saying, seeing as how iPhoto runs only on a Mac, but I put it in for 
completeness. I wrote this book for the latest version of iPhoto (iPhoto 
’09) available at the time of this book’s printing.
 
✓ Universal Serial Bus (USB) ports: You’ll need one port on your camera 
and one (at least) on your Mac. These ports allow you to connect your 
camera to your computer and import your photos into the iPhoto 
Library.
 
✓ An A-to-B USB cable: This cable connects your camera to your com-
puter (using the USB ports): hence, to iPhoto. This cable probably came 
with your camera, but if it didn’t, you’ll have to buy one. Make sure the 
cable you get has the proper connector on the camera end: They do vary. 
The USB connector for the Mac is a standard 6-pin USB connector — it’s 
the same for all computers.

• iWeb: Sends the selected photos to iWeb.
In the lower-left of the main window is what I call the small toolbar because 
it contains some very useful, one-click actions. From left to right, the 
buttons are
 
✓ Create New: Also referred to as the Add button, clicking this creates a 
new Album, Smart Album, MobileMe Gallery, book, calendar, card, or 
slideshow.
 
✓ Get Info: Shows information about the selected photo(s).
 
✓ Full Screen: Clicking this button expands the window to full-screen size.
Toward the center of the iPhoto main window, you can find the Search field 
that allows you to input your photo search criteria, such as title, description, 
date, keyword, or photo rating. Chapter 6 discusses the Search field in detail.
On the bottom right of the iPhoto window, the thumbnail size adjusting slider 
allows you to change the size of the thumbnails over a continuous range.
That’s the power and the scope of iPhoto. Taking and processing your 
photos has never been so much fun.

Putting iPhoto through Its Paces
In This Chapter
▶ Getting your photos into iPhoto
▶ Using quick and easy edits
▶ Printing your photos with iPhoto
▶ Modifying preferences
A
fter you get a feel for the iPhoto interface, jumping in and trying it out 
is a great idea. In this chapter, you get started using the program with a 
simple iPhoto project.
Yes, that’s right; dive right in! After you take a photo, you can transfer it to 
your computer, edit it to improve how it looks, and then create your first 
print with iPhoto. I guide you through those very steps in this 
chapter. This process helps you see that iPhoto software is 
incredibly powerful as well as easy to understand and use.
Also in this chapter, I show you how to modify the 
default iPhoto preferences so they reflect how you 
work, thus truly making them your own. As you find 
out more about iPhoto, you can come back and 
modify these preferences to meet your needs.
 
I use a photo named Chapter2Photo in this chapter 
to demonstrate using iPhoto for editing. If you wish 
to use this photo, you can download it from www.
dummies.com/go/iphotofd. Or you’re free to use 
your own photo because the processes described apply 
to any photograph needing editing.
Importing Photos into iPhoto
The first thing you have to do to use iPhoto to edit photos is, well, to import 
some photos. Importing simply means downloading photos from your camera 

20
Part I: Getting Ready to Roll with iPhoto ’09 
(or other storage device) to your computer. Because you can’t work on pho-
tographs in iPhoto without importing them first, it’s imperative to practice 
imports so you become comfortable with the process and understand the 
steps involved.
To import photos, follow these steps:
 
1. Open iPhoto and choose File➪Import to Library.
 
 Your hard drive directory structure appears on your screen. Open the 
folder that contains the photo you want to import.
 
 For now, import photos from your hard drive. I cover other means of 
importing in Chapter 3, such as importing from your camera or a flash 
card.
 
2. Highlight the photo’s filename by clicking it, and then click Import.
 
 One way iPhoto organizes your photos is by what it calls Events. An 
Event in iPhoto is how iPhoto groups photos by the dates they were 
captured. You can also create groups manually after importing photos. 
(See Chapter 4 for more on organizing and grouping photos.) Figure 2-1 
shows the iPhoto window and the imported photo, which has the tem-
porary name untitled event. I know, it isn’t very glamorous, but you can 
change it to a better name right away.
 
 You can have several iPhoto libraries that you use for importing 
although you can work with only one at a time. This procedure is 
explained in detail in Chapter 3.
 
3. Click the words untitled event, type a name of your choice, and then 
press Return.
 
 Ordinarily, the Event name you choose would signify an event that uni-
fies all the photos contained within it, such as Kim’s 10th Birthday, or 
Jane and Tom’s 40th Anniversary Party. In this case, you have only one 
photo, and the reason for that photo is to understand the editing pro-
cess. So an Event name, such as My First Edit, is still significant.
 
See Chapter 3 for more on importing photos.
Performing Simple Edits
There are many great things to like about iPhoto, but to me, its greatest 
plus is nondestructive editing. One of the goals of iPhoto is for your original 
photos to remain just that — original, unchanged, and unharmed. Simply put, 
the original photo in the iPhoto Library is never changed. Behind the scenes, 
iPhoto keeps track of all your edits for a photo and applies them whenever 
you want to view, edit, or publish the photo. Amazing, isn’t it?

21
 Chapter 2: Putting iPhoto through Its Paces
 
 
Figure 2-1: Your imported photo, grouped as an untitled event.
To begin to do any type of edit, you must open your photo in the Edit pane 
(iPhoto’s main window in Edit mode). From there, you can see the collection 
of tools available to you — and quite a collection it is. The Edit window gives 
you eight tools to help you improve your photograph — tools that handle 
rotation, cropping, straightening, enhancing, removing red eye, retouching, 
adding photo effects, and adjusting color. The first six tools provide a lot of 
editing power that will improve your photos quickly and easily, and it’s worth 
trying them first. Chapter 7 gives you a chance to use the more advanced 
tools to see what they can do.
To quickly and easily improve your photos, follow these steps:
 
1. You can either double-click your image or highlight it; then click Edit.
 
 As shown in Figure 2-2, you’re now in the iPhoto Edit pane, with all the 
editing tools displayed on the toolbar at the bottom of the window.

22
Part I: Getting Ready to Roll with iPhoto ’09 
 
Toolbar
 
Figure 2-2: The iPhoto Editing pane and toolbar.
 
 For the photo shown in Figure 2-2, no rotating is needed, but it looks like 
a little cropping, straightening, and exposure adjustment are in order.
 
 In this photo, the wooden railing is distracting and tends to pull the eye 
down to the bottom of the photo. Every photo you take has something 
you want the viewer’s eye attracted to — a central focus — so always be 
on the lookout for distracting items that negate that focus. Take care of 
the cropping first.
 
2. Click the Crop button.
 
 You now have an outline within your photo that has adjustable corners 
and sides, as shown in Figure 2-3.
 
3. Place your mouse on each side, top, and bottom of the cropping rect-
angle and adjust it so that it covers most of the photo but not the parts 
you want to remove.
 
4. Click the Apply button (located immediately under the photo) to com-
plete the crop operation and return to the Edit pane, where the newly 
cropped photo is displayed, as shown in Figure 2-4.
 
 If you want to compare this cropped photo with the one you started 
with, press and release the Shift key to toggle between them.

 Thank goodness that you can always Undo your last operation by either 
choosing Edit➪Undo or by pressing Ô+Z on the keyboard.
 
5. Click the Straighten button to make additional adjustments.
 
 As you see in Figure 2-5, the tree and the flagstick appear to be slightly 
crooked. At the bottom center of the photo, you see a control area with 
a slider to correct this.
 
 
Figure 2-5: The photograph before straightening corrections have been made.
 
6. Click and drag the indicator in the center of the slider to the right or 
left to straighten the photo.
 
 To the right of the slider is the degree indicator, which tells you the 
amount of adjustment. When you’re finished, click the Straighten button 
again to set the correction.
 
 For the photo in this example, I applied an adjustment of 2.9 degrees to 
make the correction, as shown in Figure 2-6.
 
 Now, I do one final edit. The photograph appears a little darker than 
desirable, but I can fix it with the Enhance tool.
 
7. Keep your eyes on the photo — because the Enhance tool works 
immediately — and click the Enhance button to see the result.
 
 Figure 2-7 shows that the grass and trees are lighter.

 In Chapter 9, you find out that you can do only so much to color and 
lighting after a photo is captured, but usually you can make it better 
with iPhoto’s tools.
 
8. Click the Done button (lower-right) of the Edit pane.
 
 This saves your changes, leaves Edit mode, and returns you to the main 
window.
Creating Your First iPhoto Print
After you improve the look of your photos with the editing tools, you might 
want to print them. What a great culmination — being in the right place, 
taking the photo, and editing it to perfection.
Follow some fundamental steps when you’re making a print. Make sure that 
the photo you want to print (for this example, I use Chapter2Photo) is high-
lighted by clicking it in the main window. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Print from the iPhoto menu, or click Print on the toolbar 
at the bottom of the main window.
 
 Notice the ellipsis (. . .) in the menu item. This always means that there 
will be more choices to make in the next dialog box.
 
2. In the dialog that appears, make the appropriate choices using the 
pop-up menus for Printer, Paper Size, Presets, and Print Size to match 
your environment.
 
 Figure 2-8 shows what some of these choices are, and you can see the 
ones that I made. Your mileage may vary, as they say, because the hard-
ware and paper you have might be different.
 
 Chapter 12 discusses the choices you can make when clicking the 
Customize button.
 
3. Click Print.
 
 At this point, you’d expect to hear the sound of your printer starting — 
or so you thought. What appears is another dialog (shown in Figure 2-9), 
allowing you to make additional printer- and paper-specific settings.
 
 These choices are very printer- and paper-specific. They deal with the 
type of paper, whether to print color or black and white, and other 
choices. Chapter 12 deals with all this in detail. For now, you can use the 
default settings.
 
4. Click Print.
 
 Voilà! Your first print is created.

 In Chapters 12 and 13, I discuss additional techniques you can use to 
print your photos.
If you started at the beginning of this chapter and have followed along up 
until now, congratulations — you just completed your first iPhoto project! 
Although this is a simple project, the techniques and tools that you used are 
similar to the ones you’ll use in any iPhoto project you might undertake in 
the future.
As Monty Python would say, “Now for something completely different.” 
Making iPhoto conform to how you want to work with your photos is accom-
plished by modifying iPhoto’s Preferences settings. It’s easy to do, and I show 
you how in the next section.
Making iPhoto Preferences Your Own
Most software provides a large number of settings for the user to choose 
from to determine how it will operate. Although the user can change them, 
the software usually makes initial selections for these settings. These are 
the default settings, and the software operates just fine using them. However, 
defaults might not reflect how you operate or be the settings you want — you 
need to make them your own. Remember that regardless of the choices you 
make at any time, you can always update and change them as you learn more 
about iPhoto.
To open and view the iPhoto Preferences, choose iPhoto➪Preferences. The 
following sections show you each of the six Preferences panes, in order. I tell 
you what settings are available for you to adjust, as well as which settings I 
choose and why. Remember, you can make your changes in any order you 
wish.
General Preferences pane
After you choose iPhoto➪Preferences, click the General button to open the 
General Preferences pane (shown in Figure 2-10). These preferences deal 
with your iPhoto software’s fundamental operation. As you progress in your 
understanding of iPhoto and work with the software, you might decide to 
change these values several times.
The General Preferences pane contains the following settings:
 
✓ Sources: Selecting the Show Last x Months Album check box places an 
Album that contains all the photos that fall within the indicated time 
span on the left side of the main screen under the Recent heading. 
Selecting the Show Item Counts check box indicates how many items are 
contained within each icon at the left side of the main screen. I leave it 
deselected because I don’t find the number very important.

29
 Chapter 2: Putting iPhoto through Its Paces
 
 
Figure 2-10: The General Preferences pane.
 
✓ Double-Click Photo: When you double-click a photo, the default set-
ting, Edits Photo, causes iPhoto to open the photo in Edit mode. I like 
this choice, but you can set it so that double-clicking simply enlarges 
the photo, making it easier to examine, by selecting the Magnifies Photo 
radio button.
 
✓ Rotate: You can choose to have iPhoto rotate pictures clockwise (the 
first radio button) or counter-clockwise (the second radio button) 
when you click the Rotate button. I prefer a clockwise direction of rota-
tion for photos, but you can choose counter-clockwise. Which one you 
prefer depends on how you normally orient your camera when shooting 
photos and can always be changed by pressing the Option key while 
clicking the Rotate button in the Edit pane.
 
✓ Edit Photo: Here you have three choices, which define how you like to 
operate in Edit mode.
 
• In Main Window: Selecting this option means that editing is done 
within the confines of the current or main window. This is my 
preference because I like to keep the number of open windows at a 
minimum.
 
• Using Full Screen: This option enlarges the editing area to encom-
pass the entire screen with pop-up editing controls on the bottom. 
This hides everything else on the Desktop.
 
• In Application: This setting allows you to choose a separate, photo-
oriented application (such as Photoshop Elements) to use for 
editing. Doing this makes iPhoto an efficient repository for your 
photos.

30
Part I: Getting Ready to Roll with iPhoto ’09 
 
✓ Email Photos Using: This setting allows you to choose Apple Mail, 
Entourage, America Online, or Eudora.
 
✓ Connecting Camera Opens: You can choose to have iPhoto open auto-
matically when you connect your camera to your computer, have Image 
Capture (which simply reads the photos on your hard drive) open, or 
have nothing at all open (which means you must drag photos from the 
camera to your hard drive manually).
 
✓ Check for iPhoto Updates Automatically: I recommend enabling this 
option because it’s a good idea to keep your software up to date. If 
selected, this happens every time iPhoto opens.
Appearance Preferences pane
To view the Appearance Preferences pane, click the Appearance button. The 
settings shown in Figure 2-11 are the defaults, and they usually work very 
well. Whether you decide to change them is up to you.
 
 
Figure 2-11: The Appearance Preferences pane.
 
✓ Border: This determines whether your thumbnails are displayed with an 
outline (border), a drop shadow, or neither. (Simply don’t select either 
check box to choose the implied Neither option.) Purely a matter of 
taste.
 
✓ Background: Use this slider to adjust the shade (from dark to light) 
of the area around your photo in the main window. A medium gray, at 
about the mid-point of the slider, isn’t distracting, and it’s usually best 
as a background for photos.
 
✓ Organize View: Selecting the Align Photos to Grid check box forces the 
thumbnails to align themselves both horizontally and vertically and 
keeps the window uncluttered. Selecting Show Scrolling Information 
gives an indication of where you are in the sort order of the photos 

31
 Chapter 2: Putting iPhoto through Its Paces
when you click your mouse on the scroll bar. The Use Smooth Scrolling 
option smoothes out the scrolling action of the windows.
 
✓ Source Text: Adjusting the text size to Large helps those who need a 
little visual help (myself included) to more easily read the text associ-
ated with the photos. The other option is Small.
Events Preferences pane
Figure 2-12 shows the default settings for the Events Preferences pane, which 
you can access by clicking the Events button. I’ve found the default settings 
to be good choices unless I have a specific reason to want a different action.
 
 
Figure 2-12: The Events Preferences pane.
 
✓ Double-Click Event: In General Preferences, you can choose the out-
come of double-clicking a photograph. This setting, however, sets the 
outcome of a double-click for an entire Event.
 
• Selecting the Shows Event Photos radio button causes the thumb-
nails for all photos in the event to appear in one window. From 
there, you can double-click an individual photo to put it in Edit 
mode, if that’s the response you chose in the General pane.
 
• The Magnifies Photo option works differently. As your mouse 
moves across the event window, the key photo (see Chapter 3 for 
more details) changes to display each of the photos contained in 
the event. When you see the one you want, you can double-click 
to open that photo for inspection, editing, and so on. Click that 
photo, and it closes. You can continue to browse and open key 
photos for the entire event. I prefer this choice because with one 
double-click, I get the photo of interest into Edit mode.
 
✓ Show Event Reflections: Selecting this check box causes a small reflec-
tion of the photo to appear beneath the thumbnail. This choice is 
strictly a matter of taste.

32
Part I: Getting Ready to Roll with iPhoto ’09 
 
✓ Show Scrolling Information: This check box serves the same function 
for events as it does in Appearance Preferences for individual photos. It 
provides an indication, in the center of the window, of where you are in 
the sort order when scrolling through many events.
 
✓ Autosplit into Events: In Chapter 1, I introduce the concept of Events, 
which is a very handy way of organizing and collecting newly imported 
photos. But suppose that not all your photos correspond to one event? 
This pop-up menu is used in conjunction with the Imported Items from 
Finder check box beneath it to remedy that situation. Importing from a 
hard drive and selecting the check box means your that photos are split 
into different events according to the pop-up menu setting as I describe 
in the bullets that follow. If the check box isn’t selected, all photos 
imported at the same time, from the same folder, are in the same event. 
The pop-up menu settings are
 
• One Event Per Day: All photos taken on the same day are grouped 
into one Event.
 
• One Event Per Week: This does the same for photos taken within 
one week of each other, starting with the first photo.
 
• Two Hour Gaps and Eight Hour Gaps: Split groups of photos into 
Events based on the timespan when they were taken.
Sharing Preferences pane
Click the Sharing button to view the Sharing Preferences pane. The settings 
for the Sharing Preferences pane are shown in Figure 2-13. By default, all 
these settings are deselected, meaning that they’re turned off. Sharing of 
any type of information must be done carefully, and when you don’t need to 
share specific information, turn off these settings.
 
I deal with sharing in more detail in Chapter 11. I recommend using the 
default settings.
Web Preferences pane
MobileMe is the new name for Apple’s .Mac service. MobileMe allows you to 
access and manage your e-mail, contacts, calendar — and, most importantly 
for our purposes, your photos via the Web and across various hardware 
devices including Macs, PCs, the iPhone, and the iPod Touch. As such, it isn’t 
a part of iPhoto, and it’s something you must pay an annual fee to use. If you 
don’t have this service and aren’t interested in finding out what it can do in 
conjunction with iPhoto, skip this section.

33
 Chapter 2: Putting iPhoto through Its Paces
I discuss this service in more detail in Chapter 11, including how to subscribe 
to MobileMe Galleries.
Click the Web button, and the Web Preferences pane appears, as shown in 
Figure 2-14.
 
 
Figure 2-13: The Sharing Preferences pane.
 
 
Figure 2-14: The Web Preferences pane.

34
Part I: Getting Ready to Roll with iPhoto ’09 
The Web Preferences available to you are the following:
 
✓ Include Location Information for Published Photos: If this check box is 
selected, the location information in the photos is uploaded along with 
the photos.
 
✓ Check for New Published Photos: This pop-up menu allows you to 
check for photos in MobileMe Gallery Albums you subscribe to at these 
chosen intervals:
 
• Manually: Occurs when you click the Check Now button
 
• Automatically: Occurs immediately when new photos are published
 
• Every Hour: Starts at the time you set this option
 
• Every Day: Starts at the time and day you set this option
 
• Every Week: Starts at the time and day you set this option
 
✓ iDisk Storage: This indicator shows how much of your allotted storage 
you’ve used; click the Buy More button to buy more storage directly 
from MobileMe.
Advanced Preferences pane
The last Preferences pane is the Advanced Preferences pane, as shown 
in Figure 2-15. The choices in this pane are very important to understand 
because they can dramatically affect your operation with iPhoto.
 
 
Figure 2-15: The Advanced Preferences pane.

35
 Chapter 2: Putting iPhoto through Its Paces
The Advanced Preferences pane includes the following settings:
 
✓ Importing: When you import photos into your library, iPhoto either 
imports a copy (when the Copy Items to the iPhoto Library check box 
is selected) or imports only a reference to the original photo (when the 
Copy Items to the iPhoto Library check box isn’t selected). In either 
case, subsequent changes made in iPhoto don’t affect the original photo-
graph, and that’s important! So what difference does it make then?
 
 When iPhoto is working with a reference, it must gather information 
from the original photo each time you open iPhoto. That means that if 
you modify the original — or even worse, move it to another volume or 
delete the original — iPhoto can no longer find it or work with it. You’ll 
still see the image when you look at your Events in iPhoto, but it’s really 
just a “picture of a picture,” and you can’t share, edit, or print the image. 
This is guaranteed to make you very uncomfortable!
 
 My advice is to leave the Copy Items to the iPhoto Library check box 
selected to ensure that you have a copy imported.
 
 Selecting the Embed ColorSync Profile check box allows your image’s 
colors to be displayed properly on either a monitor or printer. If your 
photo doesn’t have a profile already attached to it, iPhoto assigns one. If 
you’re sure you want to assign your own profile at some later time, leave 
the check box deselected.
 
 If you’re not sure what all this means, you definitely should leave the 
Embed ColorSync Profile check box selected.
 
✓ Raw Photos: If you’ll be using an external editor (such as Photoshop) 
and want to have the Raw image transferred to that editor, select the 
Use Raw When Using External Editor check box. (I discuss Raw images 
in detail in Chapter 9.) Selecting the Save Edits as 16-bit TIFF Files check 
box ensures that your edited files preserve their highest resolution.
 
✓ Look Up Places: When this option is set to Automatically, iPhoto uses 
the GPS coordinates that specify the location where that photo was taken 
and drops a marker pin for that location name on your map in Places, in 
the Source list. This occurs at the time of import or whenever location 
information is updated. If the option is set to Never, iPhoto never looks up 
location names. Places are explained in detail in Chapter 3.
You can change Preferences at any time, and the changes are usually the 
result of you changing how you interact with the software.

Importing Your Images into iPhoto
In This Chapter
▶ Hardware methods for bringing photos into your computer
▶ Troubleshooting the import process
▶ Understanding all your import options
S
imply defined, importing photos is the process of downloading your 
photos from your camera (or other storage device) to your computer. 
Lately, the photographic software industry has begun calling the process 
of importing photos into the computer ingesting. For me, that conjures up 
scenes from old science fiction thrillers where monsters satisfied their needs 
at the expense of the local inhabitants. I assure you that isn’t an accurate 
description of what happens at import time, and I’m going to continue to use 
the term import in this book.
Those of you who already have your photos imported to 
your computer are likely wondering what all the fuss is 
about. Case closed, right? No, this idea of importing is 
more than just physically bringing the photographic 
file onto your hard drive. It’s about safety, backup, 
and nondestructive editing.
Take a look at this chapter and the import process, 
and you’ll see what I mean.
Importing Your Photos 
from Your Camera
You can use any of several ways to import your digital photos from 
your camera to your computer. They all work, but some are preferable — 
depending on the source of the photos and how you like to work with them — 
and I want you to understand why. The possibilities are as follows:

38
Part I: Getting Ready to Roll with iPhoto ’09 
 
✓ Importing from a memory card reader
 
✓ Importing directly from the camera
 
✓ Importing from an external hard drive or any other data storage 
device, such as a CD or DVD or a USB flash drive
 
 Typically, this method is for photos saved previously or for photos 
PhotoCDs from film developer companies
Face it: You’ve taken a great deal of time and care to capture events that 
are important to you, and the last thing you want is to negate that effort and 
lose your photos. It’s important to remember that at this point in time, the 
only places where these photos exist are in your mind and in your camera. 
Unfortunately, iPhoto can’t do a mind-meld, but with proper care, it can 
ensure the safety of what’s in your camera.
I’ll start with what I consider the best choice.
Importing using a memory card reader
Like many professional photographers, I’m not in favor of doing a direct, 
camera-to-computer import. I recommend removing the flash or SD memory 
card from your camera and inserting it into a card reader, which is connected 
to your computer using the computer’s Universal Serial Bus (USB) port. This 
lessens the possibility of damage to your camera, and it’s certainly as fast 
as a direct connection. Nearly every digital camera comes with a removable 
card of some kind. If the camera also has internal memory, I recommend that 
you set the camera to use its removable memory card for photo storage. The 
particular card reader shown in Figure 3-1 can handle several different types 
of cards. Make sure the card reader you choose can read the type of card 
your camera uses.
 
 
Figure 3-1: A typical flash/SD card reader.

39
 Chapter 3: Importing Your Images into iPhoto
Importing from a memory card is just as simple as importing from a camera. 
To use a card reader to import photos, follow these steps:
 
1. Remove the flash or SD card from your camera, using your camera 
manufacturer’s instructions.
 
 Most likely, those instructions include turning off the camera power and 
opening a small door in the camera body to remove the card.
 
2. Plug the card reader into a USB port on your computer.
 
3. Insert your flash or SD card into the card reader.
 
4. Start iPhoto, if it isn’t already running.
 
 A window similar to the one in Figure 3-2 opens and displays the name 
of the camera that the card came from in the Source list (under Devices) 
on the left side of the window and the photos on the card in the iPhoto 
main window.
 
 To automatically start iPhoto before importing (which means that it 
starts when you connect a device to the computer), see the section 
“Automatically Starting iPhoto Before Importing” later in this chapter.

5. Fill in the Event Name and Description.
 
 This is your chance to give the Event a name that signifies the theme of 
the photos and set a longer description of the Event.
 
6. Determine the actions for the check boxes.
 
• Autosplit Events After Importing: Select this check box if you want 
iPhoto to divide your photos into separate Events based on the 
date and time you took them.
 
• Hide Photos Already Imported: Select this option if you already 
imported some of the photos on the camera. The duplicate photos 
won’t appear in the iPhoto window, so they won’t be imported 
again.
 
 In the example import in Figure 3-3, some photos were taken more than 
two hours apart. Because the Autosplit Events After Importing option 
was selected and because I has set the limit in Event Preferences (see 
Chapter 2 for more on Event Preferences) as Two-Hour Gaps, two Events 
are produced even though all the photos were taken on the same day.
 
 
Figure 3-3: Importing photos with the Autosplit Events option and two-hour gaps.

41
 Chapter 3: Importing Your Images into iPhoto
 
7. Click the appropriate Import button.
 
 If you wish to import only some of the photos, select them and then 
click the Import Selected button. Otherwise, click the Import All button. 
When the import is complete, iPhoto asks whether you want to delete 
the photos in the camera. I find it best and safest to do this action sepa-
rately, using the controls in the camera (see the camera owner’s manual 
for instructions), so click No in the dialog.
 
8. (Optional) If you used the Autosplit Events After Importing option to 
create multiple Events, click the additional untitled event titles and 
change them to what you want.
 
 Because the import window has a place for only one Event name, you 
must change additional Events after the import.
 
9. Remove the card from the card reader by clicking the Eject button 
next to the camera name under Devices in the Source list.
 
 Always use the Eject button to do this. If you just pull the card out of the 
card reader, you risk problems, including lost data.
 
10. Disconnect the card reader from your computer.
Importing directly from your camera
If you don’t have a memory card reader or prefer a more direct method, you 
can easily import your photos into iPhoto. Here’s what you do:
 
1. Connect the small end of the USB cable to your camera.
 
 The USB connection on a camera is usually under some kind of rubber 
flap to keep out dirt. Because each camera is different, you need to 
use the camera’s owner’s manual to determine where this connection 
is. One end of the USB cable is much smaller than the other, and the 
smaller end is the one that connects to the camera.
 
2. Connect the larger end of the USB cable to your computer.
 
 Connect the USB cable directly into a USB port on the computer. You can 
connect to a USB hub if necessary although this doesn’t always work.
 
3. Turn the camera on, if it isn’t on already.
 
4. Start iPhoto, if it isn’t already running.
 
 If everything is connected properly, you see your camera appear in 
the Source list under Devices on the left side of the iPhoto window, as 
shown in Figure 3-4. You will also see all the photographs contained 
within the camera in the iPhoto main pane.

42

 To automatically start iPhoto before importing (which means that it 
starts when you connect a device to the computer), see the next section, 
“Automatically Starting iPhoto Before Importing.”

Figure 3-4: iPhoto with a camera connected.
 
5. Fill in the Event Name and Description.
 
 Give the Event a name that signifies the theme of the photos and set a 
longer description of the Event.
 
6. Determine the actions for the check boxes.
 
• Autosplit Events After Importing: Select this option if you want 
iPhoto to divide your photos into separate Events based on the 
date you took them.
 
• Hide Photos Already Imported: Select this check box if any of the 
photos on the camera have already been imported. As a result, 
they won’t be imported again.
 
7. Click the appropriate Import button.
 
 If you wish to import only photos that you selected, click Import 
Selected; otherwise, click Import All. When the import is complete, 
iPhoto asks whether you want to delete the photos in the camera. Again, 

43
 Chapter 3: Importing Your Images into iPhoto
I find it best and safest to do this action separately, using the controls in 
the camera. So click No in the dialog.
 
8. (Optional) If you used the Autosplit Events After Importing option to 
create multiple Events, click the additional untitled Event titles and 
change them to what you want.
 
 Because the import window has a place for only one Event name, you 
must change additional Events after the import.
 
9. When you imported all photos, it’s safe to Control-click (or right-click) 
your camera icon in the Source list and choose Unmount. Or, you can 
drag your camera icon into the iPhoto Trash.
 
 Only when this is done is it safe to turn off your camera and then physi-
cally disconnect it from your computer.
 
10. Disconnect the camera from the computer.
Importing your photos from a CD or hard drive
Importing photos from external media is almost as easy as importing from 
your camera or memory card. This is a big advantage for many reasons. You 
might have photos that you took sometime in the past, and they’re already 
saved to your computer. You might have a 35mm or medium-format camera 
that uses film, which you had processed, digitized, and saved on a disc. Or 
the photos might have come to you attached to an e-mail, either with the 
Apple Mail client or even Web mail. Whatever the scenario might be, now 
you want to organize your old, existing photos in iPhoto. The import process 
goes like this:
 
1. If the photos aren’t already on a hard drive or disc, put them there.
 
 I don’t recommend dragging photos into iPhoto — there’s too much 
chance for error. Instead, highlight the photos and save them to the 
appropriate location.
 
2. Open iPhoto and choose File➪Import to Library.
 
 iPhoto imports file formats such as JPEG, TIFF, and RAW. You can read 
more about file formats in Chapter 7.
 
3. Navigate to the place where the photos are stored (shown in Figure 3-5) 
and select the photo file(s)/folder(s) you want to import.
 
 By using List view in the Finder, as shown, you can select multiple files/
folders at one time.
 
4. Click the Import button.
 
 The photo file(s)/folder(s) is imported. The last Event imported appears 
in iPhoto under Last Import in the Source list, as shown in Figure 3-6. 
(Your import(s) also appear in the Events window.) The Last Import 
pane shows the last photo(s) that were imported.

 Chapter 3: Importing Your Images into iPhoto
 
5. (Optional) In this case, I didn’t give an Event name at Import time. 
However, you can always change an Event name by clicking the Event 
Name area (in this case, it reads untitiled event) and typing a new 
name.
 
 Events are created for your photos depending on the settings you make in 
Events Preferences (discussed in Chapter 2). If the Imported Items from 
Finder check box isn’t selected, Events are created based on the folders 
the photos are imported from, regardless of the date on which you took 
them (the capture date). That means that all photos in any folder are in 
one Event, with the folder name as the Event name. If the Imported Items 
from Finder check box is selected, all photos with the same capture date, 
regardless of the folder they’re in, are placed in the same Event, and the 
Event name is the name of the first folder in the batch to be imported. If 
the photos are not in a folder, untitled event will be used.
Automatically Starting iPhoto Before Importing
If you’re the kind of person who gets aggravated each time you connect your 
camera or card reader, only to realize you haven’t started iPhoto yet, the 
solution is very simple. If this doesn’t apply to you (come on — ’fess up; you 
know it does), feel free to skip this section, secure in the knowledge that 
you’re far above the rest of us.
To set iPhoto to open automatically before importing photos from your digi-
tal camera, follow these steps:
 
1. Open iPhoto and choose iPhoto➪Preferences.
 
2. Click the General button on the toolbar.
 
 This opens the General Preferences pane.
 
3. Near the bottom of the General Preferences pane, you see a Connecting 
Camera Opens option. Set it for iPhoto, as shown in Figure 3-7.
 
 This ensures that whether you connect a camera or the card reader, 
iPhoto will open.
 
4. Close the dialog.
 
 This saves your selection.

Select iPhoto
 
Figure 3-7: Set this preference to open iPhoto automatically.
Adding and Editing Keywords in iPhoto
Keywords are labels that you can add to your photos to provide additional 
information about the subject — and, more importantly, make searches more 
efficient. I discuss iPhoto’s searching capabilities in detail in Chapter 6, but at 
this point, during the import process, I encourage you to add your keywords. 
If your imported photos already have keywords, you might want to edit them 
to ensure more accurate retrievals.
You can use these two ways to view keywords in iPhoto:
 
✓ Move your mouse over the photo.
 
✓ From the iPhoto menu, choose Window➪Show Keywords.
When you find the photo’s keywords (or find that they don’t have any yet), 
you can edit (or add) them. Take a look at both of these methods in more 
detail. First, try moving your mouse over the selected photo. To do so, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Select Photos in the Source list, find the photo of interest, and simply 
move the mouse over it.
 
 If you move your mouse over a photo that has no keywords, you see add 
keywords beneath the photo, as shown in Figure 3-8. If you see keywords, 
proceed to Step 3.

47
 Chapter 3: Importing Your Images into iPhoto
 
Add your keywords here
 
Figure 3-8: Photo showing where to add keywords.
 
2. To add keywords to a photo that doesn’t have any, click add key-
words and type in your keywords, separating each with a comma.
 
 That’s all there is to adding keywords.
 
3. To edit existing keywords, click any one of the keywords. Double-
click the one to be edited to highlight it; then type your changes. Then 
press Return if you’re finished editing, or double-click another key-
word and edit it.
Another way to add or edit keywords is to use this second method:
 
1. Choose Window➪Show Keywords.
 
 The Keywords dialog shown in Figure 3-9 appears, showing all current 
keywords and providing a means for editing them and creating new 
ones. To create a new one, continue with the steps that follow.

2. Click the Edit Keywords button.
 
 You see the Edit Keywords dialog, as shown in Figure 3-10.
 
 
Figure 3-10: The Edit Keywords dialog.
 
3. Click the + button in the dialog to create an Untitled keyword entry 
space. Type the new keyword and click OK.
 
 The keyword automatically gets a shortcut assigned (usually the first 
letter of the keyword, or the second letter if the first is already taken, 
and so on) and is placed in the Quick Group at the top of the dialog.
 
 In Figure 3-11, I added Crater Lake for the keyword.
 
 
Figure 3-11: Showing the new keyword.
 
4. Select the appropriate photo in the iPhoto main window, and then 
click the Crater Lake keyword button you just created.
 
 The keyword appears beneath the photo.

 Chapter 3: Importing Your Images into iPhoto
 
 Figure 3-12 shows the Crater Lake keyword applied to the photo.
 
5. To edit a current keyword, click Edit Keywords, highlight the keyword 
to be edited, click the Rename button, and make your changes. If you 
want to change the shortcut, click the Shortcut button and make your 
change. When you’re finished, click OK.
 
 
Figure 3-12: The new keyword added to the photo.
 
 Another way to add or delete keywords from a photo is to select the 
photo, open the Show Keywords dialog, and click a current keyword to 
delete it or click a new keyword to add it. There’s even some animation 
that goes along with these actions.
 
I recommend adding and/or editing keywords right after you import your 
photos. Of course, you can add and edit keywords at any time.
Adding Places to Your Photos
During the capture of your photos, your camera, if it’s suitably equipped, can 
attach GPS data to your photos. (Check your camera’s manual to find out 
whether your camera has this feature.)
If your camera isn’t so equipped, all is not lost — as long as you can remem-
ber where you were! I recommend adding this location data right after you 
import your photos. Of course, you can add and edit location information at 
any time.
 
Any location information added by your camera or by you becomes part 
of the metadata for the photo. That means that it can be viewed by anyone 
having access to that photo. If you don’t wish to share this information, don’t 
enter it manually. Also, check your camera manual to see how to turn off the 
GPS capability.

50
Part I: Getting Ready to Roll with iPhoto ’09 
To add locations to your photos manually, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the photo, photos, or Event to which you want to add a location.
 
 When you move the mouse pointer over a photo or Event, a small, white 
Information button appears in the lower-right corner.
 
2. Click the Information button.
 
 The photo or Event flips to the back so that you can enter information. If 
you select multiple photos or an entire Event, entering location informa-
tion for one photo enters it for all.
 
3. Click Enter Event Location, and then type the name of the place where 
you took the photo.
 
 This is why I said you have to remember where you were.
 
 As you type, a list of matching locations appears, as shown in Figure 3-13. 
If necessary, scroll to find the correct name and select it.
 
 If you’re not connected to the Internet, you won’t be able to complete 
the next steps in this section, which require that you are. As soon as you 
do connect, finish these steps by using Places Maps and the My Places 
dialog.

 If you don’t see a location match in the list, follow these steps:
 
a. Click New Place.
 
 The Edit My Places dialog appears, as shown in Figure 3-14.
 
 Type as much address information as possible and then press 
Return. One or more matches appears. Select the one you want, 
and a blue pin marks the spot on the map.
 
Type the location’s address here

b. Move the pin manually to fine-tune the location. Drag the arrow on 
the circle to increase or decrease the circle size.
 
c. Add this new location to My Places by clicking the + button next to the 
address in the list.
 
 Adding a location to My Places makes it available to be chosen in 
other photos taken at the same place.
 
d. When you’re satisfied, click the Assign to Photo button. (This is 
called the Assign to Event button if you’re adding the location to 
an entire Event.) Proceed to Step 4.
 
 iPhoto enters the name and produces a map with a pin in it depicting 
that location, as shown in Figure 3-15.

You can even add and name a personal location that might not have an 
address. Suppose you have a photo that you took at your friend’s cabin near 
Crater Lake. Here’s how you can set that location.
 
1. Select the photo (or Event, if all the photos were taken at the same 
place) and click the small Information button.
 
2. Click New Place.
 
3. Click the Google Search button.
 
 You can drag the map up, down, left, and right, and use the + and – 
buttons to zoom in and out in order to get the approximate place you’re 
looking for.
 
4. Click the Drop Pin button, and then drag the head of the pin to posi-
tion it where you want it, as shown in Figure 3-17.
 
 
Figure 3-17: Adding a personal location.
 
5. The new location is added to the list on the left and appears as New 
Place; click it, type the name for this location, and then press Return.
 
6. Click the Assign to Photo button. (This is the Assign to Event button if 
you’re adding the location to an entire Event.) Click the plus sign next 
to the name.
 
 This adds the location to My Places.

To remove a location from any photo, move the mouse over it, click the 
white Information button, and then select the location name. Click the small 
X button at the right side of the location name.
Adding Ratings To Your Photos
Ratings are a very subjective way of classifying your photos. It’s kind of like a 
Hollywood critic judging a movie — only in this case, you’re the critic. As you 
can see in Chapter 6, making a rating can help find those photos you want to 
have a closer look at, or those where you want to do more intense editing. 
Ratings can be changed at any time. To set them, do the following:
 
1. Select a photo or photos for which you want to set ratings.
 
 If you select more than one photo, when you set a rating, it will be 
applied to all the selected photos.
 
2. Either right-click or Control-click any of the photos. In the menu that 
appears, choose My Rating and then choose None or 1 to 5 stars.
 
 Alternatively, you could also choose Photos➪My Rating and choose 
None or 1 to 5 stars. Figure 3-18 shows the menu choices.
 
 
Figure 3-18: Choosing a rating from the menu.

55
 Chapter 3: Importing Your Images into iPhoto
 
3. You can also simply click one or more of the dots that appear beneath 
the photo thumbnails to set the rating.
 
 If you click a star already set for a photo, it will be canceled, and the 
rating will be one less. This is the easiest way to add or delete stars for 
individual photos.
Setting the Key Photo for an Event
When you look at all the Events in your Library, you see that only one pho-
tograph is displayed per Event (see Figure 3-19) even though the Event con-
tains several photos. This photo is called the key photo, and it’s meant to give 
an indication of the type of content within that Event folder.
 
 
Figure 3-19: Showing the key photo for each Event.
By default, the first photo imported into an Event becomes the key photo, but 
you might prefer another photo. To change the photo used as the key photo, 
follow these simple steps:
 
1. Click Events in the Source list and then move your mouse across the 
Event slowly.
 
 You see all the photos in the Event displayed one after the other.

56
Part I: Getting Ready to Roll with iPhoto ’09 
 
2. When the photo you’re interested in appears, simply right-click (or 
Control-click) your mouse and choose Make Key Photo. Or, even more 
simply, just press the spacebar.
 
 The photo you selected now becomes the key photo.
Another way to do this is as follows:
 
1. Double-click the Event to open it in another window and show all the 
photos.
 
 This allows you to more easily choose the likely candidate for key 
photo.
 
2. When you determine which one you want, highlight it and choose 
Events➪Make Key Photo.
 
 Any time you change your mind, you can make this selection again and 
choose another photo.
Handling Import Problems
Sometimes, no matter how careful you are, things happen that cause prob-
lems during the import process. They might occur because of inadvertent 
errors you made or because the software or hardware simply can’t do what 
you want it to do. iPhoto can handle up to 250,000 photographs in its Library. 
Sounds like you shouldn’t have any worries, but you don’t have unlimited 
hard drive space or computer memory, so the theoretical limit might be 
much lower for you — and that can be a problem. Depending on the situa-
tion, here are some things to try:
 
✓ Make more storage space available. One obvious solution is to buy 
more hard disk space. Before doing that, though, you can try an easier 
and less-costly solution. You can back up your Library or part of your 
Library to a CD or DVD and then delete those less-often used photos 
from the Library, gaining back that space. When necessary, use the pro-
cedures in this chapter to import those photos back to the Library from 
the CD or DVD you backed them up on.
 
✓ Check your camera to ensure that it’s on and properly set to transfer 
photos. If the camera is connected properly but doesn’t appear in the 
Source list, perhaps some camera-specific settings are incorrect for file 
transfer. Also check to ensure the USB cable is seated in the connector 
properly. If you have another USB cable, try substituting that one, and 
plug the cable into another USB port on your computer.

57
 Chapter 3: Importing Your Images into iPhoto
 
✓ Quit other programs to speed up the process. Depending on your 
operating environment, you might find the import operation to be run-
ning slowly. If you have other programs open, try quitting them to see 
whether that helps.
 
✓ If you have multiple USB ports on your computer, use one that doesn’t 
have other devices connected to it if possible. This will eliminate any 
contention among devices for time on the port. Also, use a USB 2.0 port, 
if available, rather than a slower USB 1.1 (commonly found on your 
keyboard).
There’s another operation you can perform regarding the Library that can 
serve two purposes. You can physically move the iPhoto Library to another 
hard drive that has more room; that way, you don’t have to worry about 
backing up to a disc and then deleting less-frequently used photos. You can 
also use this to create multiple iPhoto Libraries so that you can separate 
photos that cover different time frames. For instance, one Library can have 
all photos you imported with dates prior to 1999, and another one covers 
2000 to the present.
Whatever your reasons, here’s how to move the iPhoto Library:
 
1. Close iPhoto if it’s open.
 
2. Open the folder where the iPhoto Library is stored and drag it to a 
new location.
 
 The default location for the Library is in the Pictures folder on your hard 
drive.
 
3. Hold down the Option key and open iPhoto.
 
 You see the dialog in Figure 3-20, asking you to create or choose a 
Library from the list iPhoto found.
 
 
Figure 3-20: Choose or create an iPhoto Library.

58
Part I: Getting Ready to Roll with iPhoto ’09 
 
4. Click a Library name in the list or click the Other Library button.
 
5. Find the location where you moved the Library in Step 2, select it, and 
click Open.
Creating a new iPhoto Library is a similar process.
 
1. Close iPhoto if it’s open.
 
2. Open the folder where the current Library is stored and either 
rename it or move it to another location.
 
 Because iPhoto can work with only one Library at a time, you must 
break the link to the current Library before you can create a new one.
 
3. Press and hold the Option key and open iPhoto.
 
 The dialog in Figure 3-20 again appears.
 
4. Click the Create New button.
 
5. Type a name of your choice for the new Library and choose a location 
to store it.
 
6. Click Save.
 
 An empty iPhoto Library is created at the location you chose and with 
the name you typed.
 
At this point, all future imports will place the photos into this moved/new 
Library.
 
Never move or rename the current iPhoto Library when iPhoto is open. This 
would likely cause corruption of the file and, potentially, permanent damage 
to the Library contents.
That’s it. With the techniques in this chapter, importing from any medium 
the Macintosh accepts is easy, and the photos that mean so much to you and 
your family are secure.

Part II
Manipulating 
Photo Organization

I
n this part of the book, I talk about getting and 
keeping your photo collection organized. With 
the advent of digital photography, we’re encour-
aged to take lots of photos. No more worries 
about running out of ﬁ lm at a crucial time, which 
used to make us ration our shots. Now, using rela-
tively inexpensive memory cards instead of ﬁ lm, 
you can shoot to your heart’s content.
Is there a downside to this bountiful harvest of cin-
ematic endeavor? Sort of. All these hundreds and 
hundreds of photo ﬁ les can become unwieldy — 
and what’s worse, irretrievable. How frustrating it 
is to know that you have a photo of a particular 
event or person, but you can’t ﬁ nd it?
Chapter 4 discusses all the different ways you can 
organize your photos, whether by the event, 
place, and even the faces in the photo! Chapter 5 
takes organization one step further, enabling you 
to take several groups of photos and combine 
them into an Album. The part concludes with 
Chapter 6, providing everything you need to know 
about searching for your photos and backing 
them up.

Events and Faces — Grouping 
Your Photos
In This Chapter
▶ How iPhoto initially creates Events
▶ Using Events to create groups
▶ Addressing multiple same-day Events
▶ Combining Events
▶ Separating Events
▶ Hiding photos without deleting them
▶ An alternate grouping strategy — Faces
T
he feature that iPhoto ’09 uses to allow quick and accu-
rate grouping of your photos is Events. Events reflect 
the baseline concept that photos taken at nearly the 
same time can be related under the heading of date 
and time, if nothing else.
For those of you upgrading from older versions of 
iPhoto, Events might be a new term for you. Events 
are similar to Film Rolls — the organization used in 
previous versions of iPhoto — that provide easier 
access to your photos. When you upgrade from 
iPhoto 6 or earlier, iPhoto converts all your Film 
Rolls into Events.
Of course, the time for a series of photos can’t be exactly 
the same, but you can set up a time span of hours, days, or 
weeks into which your photos will be gathered, forming an Event. 
There’s a lot of latitude in how Events are named and displayed, as 
well as how Event contents can be changed after they’re created.

62
Part II: Manipulating Photo Organization 
For your photos that contain people, you can also use facial recognition 
technology — Faces — to not only group photos containing the same person 
but also make them all easy to find. Sounds like stuff out of a spy novel, 
doesn’t it? But it’s actually part of iPhoto’s capability. Time to get up close 
and personal with Events and Faces.
Understanding iPhoto’s Default 
for Creating Events
A great deal of information is generated by most cameras and stored as 
part of the photographs you take. This information can comprise the type 
of camera; the lens’ focal length, shutter speed, and aperture; and a host of 
other details, including the date and time of the photo capture. All this info 
is vital for iPhoto because this is how (by default) it first creates Events. And 
for cameras so equipped, this information can also contain GPS coordinates 
and location, which can be used by Places in iPhoto.
 
The information generated by the camera — metadata — is included 
within the image. This metadata goes by the name EXIF, which stands for 
Exchangeable Image File data. It generally contains date and time, camera set-
tings, copyright information, and much more.
Figure 4-1 shows a sample of this metadata information. Just highlight a 
photograph in iPhoto and choose Photos➪Show Photo Info.
 
 
Figure 4-1: Viewing a photo’s metadata.

63
 Chapter 4: Events and Faces — Grouping Your Photos
Because the original date and time of capture are embedded, it doesn’t 
matter what day you import your photos into iPhoto or whether you down-
load from a Flash card or the camera itself (via USB cable) to import the 
photos — the date of capture is preserved in the photo.
And here’s one other important thing to know about the default grouping — 
it isn’t forever. At any time after import, you can change the name of an Event 
and alter the Event contents. I’ll show you how to do that.
Creating Groupings Using Your Events
All of us have experienced milestone events in our lives. The ones that 
are important to you will define how your iPhoto Library is constructed. 
Regardless of how Events were assembled and named in iPhoto initially, you 
might want to redefine and rearrange how your photos are stored, thus creat-
ing a customized Event. In iPhoto, that’s easy and straightforward.
To create a customized Event
 
1. Select Photos from the Source list in iPhoto.
 
 With this selection, you can now view all the photos in all Events in your 
Library.
 
2. Select all the photos you want to include in your customized Event.
 
 To select nonconsecutive photos, hold down the Command key (Ô) and 
click the photos you want. To select consecutive photos, hold down 
the Shift key, click the starting photo, and then click the ending photo. 
Figure 4-2 shows a sample of how this might look when selecting non-
consecutive photos.
 
3. Choose Events➪Create Event.
 
 The Create New Event dialog opens, as shown in Figure 4-3.
 
 You see a warning message in the dialog reminding you that photos 
can be in only one Event — and, therefore, the selected photos will be 
moved to the new Event and removed from the Event they were previ-
ously grouped in.
 
4. Click Create and then select Events from the Source list.
 
5. A new untitled event appears containing the photos you selected, as 
shown in Figure 4-4.
 
 Photos will retain their original capture dates despite being moved from 
one Event to another. This way, unless you choose to change the dates 
you can always tell, in the future, exactly when the photos were taken.

64
Part II: Manipulating Photo Organization 
 
 
Figure 4-2: A nonconsecutive photo selection.
 
 
Figure 4-3: The Create New Event dialog.
 
6. To change the name of the Event, click the name untitled event and 
then enter a new name.
 
 If the photos in the new Event were taken on different dates, a date 
range will display beneath the Event name. In iPhoto, you have the 
opportunity, using the Batch Change option, to make the date and time 
of all the photos in an Event the same, or to change just the date. You 
can also modify the photo’s Title, Time, and Description.
 
7. To use the Batch Change option, make sure the Event is still selected 
and then choose Photos➪Batch Change.

65
 Chapter 4: Events and Faces — Grouping Your Photos
 
 
Figure 4-4: The new untitled event.
 
 Figure 4-5 shows an example of a date change to be made. This change 
affects only the currently edited state of your photos in the Library. If 
you want to modify the originally imported photos as well, select the 
Modify Original Files check box.
 
 
Figure 4-5: Use Batch Change to edit an Event’s date.
 
8. Click OK.
 
 The change is made.

66
Part II: Manipulating Photo Organization 
 
 Figure 4-6 shows the changes applied. Notice that after the change, the 
date shown for the entire Event is the new date you chose.
 
The new date for the Event
 
Figure 4-6: An Event with a new date applied.
 
9. Another way to make date and time changes is to choose Photos➪
Adjust Date and Time.
 
 With this command, the date and time of each photo is shifted, based 
upon the new date and time for the first photo in the Event. The original 
files may also be changed if desired. For example, if the photos in the 
Event are each one day apart, changing the first one by one month will 
simply shift all photos in the Event by that amount. There will still be a 
one day difference between them, though. This capability is shown in 
Figure 4-7.
 
 Although you can’t see all the photos, the photo dates originally 
spanned Jan 3, 2005 to Feb 3, 2007. Note in Figure 4-8 that they will 
now span Jan 3, 2006 to Feb 3, 2008.

Part II: Manipulating Photo Organization 
Dealing with Multiple Same-Day Events
The idea of separating photos taken on different days into different Events 
works very well. Events can be a birthday, wedding, trip to the lake, visit to 
Uncle Harry, and so on. But what happens if you do more than one of these 
on a single day? Turns out that iPhoto can be of some help there, too.
As you see in Figure 4-9, you can choose to Autosplit into Events in Events 
Preferences (see Chapter 2 for more on Events Preferences) based on a 2- or 
8-hour gap in capture time on the same day. If the Events you’re dealing with 
don’t fit that time frame, you have to use the techniques described in this 
chapter to move photos between Events to restore the Event separation you 
desire.
 
 
Figure 4-9: Setting 2- or 8-hour Event gaps.
Merging Events
Another way to manually manipulate Events is to merge two or more Events 
into one. Perhaps you photographed a lake scene at two different times of 
the year and would like to merge the photos into an Event called A Change of 
Seasons at the Lake. To merge Events
 
1. Select Events from the Source list.
 
2. Ô-click to select the two or more Events you want to merge.
 
3. Either click the Merge button (bottom-left of the iPhoto toolbar) or 
choose Events➪Merge Events, as shown in Figure 4-10.
 
4. In the dialog that appears, click Merge Events.
 
 The first Event selected becomes the one into which all other selected 
Events will be merged.
 
5. You can now rename the merged Event by clicking the Event name 
and typing a new one.
 
 You can also use the Information (the lowercase “i”) button (lower-left 
corner of the iPhoto window) to do this.

69
 Chapter 4: Events and Faces — Grouping Your Photos
 
 
Figure 4-10: Merging two Events.
You can also merge two or more Events by simply dragging them onto the 
Event you want to merge them with. As is often the case in iPhoto, there are 
multiple ways to accomplish the same result. Dragging and merging works 
like this:
 
1. Select the Event or Events, using Ô-click, to be merged into another.
 
2. Click and drag onto the Event to be merged with.
 
 A dialog appears, verifying the operation that’s about to begin, as shown 
in Figure 4-11.
 
 
Figure 4-11: Merging Events by dragging.

70
Part II: Manipulating Photo Organization 
 
3. Click the Merge button.
 
 The selected Event(s) will be merged, in order, into the Event they’re 
being dragged onto.
Splitting Events
Another technique you can use to manipulate how your photos have been 
stored is to split an Event. This can be useful if, for instance, you were photo-
graphing multiple happenings on a single day but they weren’t more than two 
hours apart. When you import into iPhoto, the photos would be stored as 
part of one Event. Using iPhoto’s Split feature for splitting them apart works 
like this:
 
1. Set the Double-Click Event option in Events Preferences to Shows 
Event Photos.
 
 For more on Events Preferences, see Chapter 2.
 
2. Select Events from the Source list and then double-click the Event you 
want to split.
 
 This displays all the photos in the Event.
 
3. Select the photos that will constitute the second Event.
 
 You can use either standard Macintosh way of selecting:
 
• Hold the Shift key and then click the first and last photos that are con-
secutive.
 
• Press Ô and then click nonconsecutive photos.
 
 Figure 4-12 shows the Event and the highlighted photos.
 
4. Click the Split button on the iPhoto toolbar or choose Events➪Split 
Events.
 
 The photos you select are moved to a new untitled event, as shown in 
Figure 4-13.
 
5. Click the name Untitled Event and type in a meaningful name.

Part II: Manipulating Photo Organization 
Hiding Photos in Events
Maybe you have photos within an Event that you want to keep in it but don’t 
want to appear when the Event is opened. Hiding a photo can be useful if 
you don’t want to use it or see it, but you’re not sure you want to delete 
it. “Magic!” you say? Not really. Just an easy way to change the look of an 
Event without losing any photos. As you might have guessed, you can hide a 
photo. Refer to Figure 4-13 as I show you how to hide one of the photos in the 
untitled event. Here’s how easy it is to do. These steps can be applied to any 
photo you want to hide.
 
1. To hide a photo, select it and either click the Hide button on the tool-
bar or choose Photos➪Hide Photo(s).
 
 The second photo in CUSTOMIZED EVENT becomes hidden, as shown 
in Figure 4-14. Notice the wording to the right of the Event name in the 
figure — Show 1 Hidden Photo — letting you know that there is one 
photo in the Event that isn’t displayed in the Event pane.
 
An Event with 1 hidden photo
 
Figure 4-14: An Event with a hidden photo.

73
 Chapter 4: Events and Faces — Grouping Your Photos
 
2. Click Show 1 Hidden Photo.
 
 The photo reappears.
 
 Figure 4-15 shows the photo reappearing with an X in its upper-right 
corner, denoting that it’s a hidden photo.
 
 Notice that the wording toggles to Hide 1 Hidden Photo. Click that, and 
the photo disappears again.
 
 
Figure 4-15: A hidden photo revealed.
 
3. If you want to see all the hidden photos in the iPhoto Library, click 
Photos in the Source list and then choose View➪Hidden Photos.
 
 The hidden photos will appear with an X in the upper-right corner. They 
are now visible but are still marked as Hidden. To hide them again, 
choose View➪Hidden Photos again to uncheck the selection.
 
4. To unhide the photos, select one or more of the hidden photos 
and then click the Unhide button on the iPhoto toolbar, or choose 
Photos➪Unhide Photo(s).
 
 This makes them visible regardless of any other settings.

74
Part II: Manipulating Photo Organization 
 
iPhoto always lets you know whether there are hidden photos, so there’s no 
fear of losing track of them — and, you can always bring them back to view if 
circumstances change.
Flagging Photos
Here’s another way of grouping some of your photos without really incurring 
any extra overhead. You, quite literally, put a flag on the photos. This flag is 
visible in the corner of the photo’s thumbnail. It’s like sorting through a stack 
of photos and setting some aside for further review. A special heading under 
Recent — Flagged — contains any flagged photos. So why bother to do this?
 
✓ You can create a temporary grouping while you browse through one 
or more Events.
 
✓ You can create a new Event from the flagged photos.
 
✓ You can move the flagged photos to another Event.
To flag photos
 
1. Select the Event you want and then open it. Or you can go to Photos in 
the Source list and see all the photos at once.
 
2. Select the photo or photos you want to flag.
 
3. Click the Flag button on the iPhoto toolbar or choose Photos➪Flag 
Photo(s).
 
 The flag indicator appears in the thumbnail. Figure 4-16 shows the 
indicator.

4. To look at all your flagged photos, select Flagged in the Source list.
 
 Figure 4-17 shows the flagged photos. Notice that the number of flagged 
photos is indicated next to the word Flagged.
 
 
Figure 4-17: Flagged photos are grouped together.
To create a new Event with the flagged photos
 
1. Choose Events➪Create Event from Flagged Photos.
 
 Because a photo can only be in one Event at a time, a warning dialog 
alerts you that the photos will be moved to the new Event.
 
2. If you’re satisfied, click the Create button.
 
 An untitled event is created containing these photos. If you change your 
mind, you always can Undo.
 
3. You can now name the Event as you like.
You can also move flagged photos to an existing Event. After you flag the 
photos
 
1. Select the Event you want to add them to.
 
2. Choose Events➪Add Flagged Photos to Selected Event.

76
Part II: Manipulating Photo Organization 
 
 The photos are moved to the selected Event. If you change your mind, 
you can always Undo.
 
If you wish to Unflag any photos, simply select them and then click the Unflag 
button on the iPhoto toolbar or choose Photos➪Unflag Photo(s).
Grouping Photos Using Faces
A wonderful feature of iPhoto, straight out of the high-tech world, is the 
facial-recognition technology called Faces. iPhoto can detect all the faces in 
the photos that you imported into your Library. When you start iPhoto ’09 
for the first time, it will scan your iPhoto Library to find photos with faces in 
them. Depending on the number of photos you have, this could take some 
time. It will then ask you to name the persons it finds and to suggest addi-
tional photos that have that person in them. You can also add the full names 
and e-mail addresses of the persons recognized by iPhoto. This provides a 
clever way to see all the photos of a particular person across any span of 
time and, perhaps, many Events.
After a face is recognized and named, it can be viewed on the Faces cork-
board by selecting Faces from the Source list. Even better, you can delete a 
face from the Faces corkboard without deleting the photo from the iPhoto 
Library.
 
This section on the operation of Faces is correct as of the time of this writing. 
You can check the Apple iPhoto Discussion Forum from iPhoto for any soft-
ware updates by choosing Help➪Service and Support, and check this book’s 
Web site at www.dummies.com/go/iphotofd for any minor updates or 
changes to the Faces operation described in the book.
Here’s how Faces works.
 
1. Click Faces in the Source list to open the Faces pane and corkboard 
for the first time, as shown in Figure 4-18.
 
 If there are no photos in the Faces pane, you either don’t have photos 
with faces, or they weren’t recognized by iPhoto. As I mentioned earlier, 
whenever photos are imported into iPhoto, they’re scanned automati-
cally to see whether there are faces to be recognized. If iPhoto didn’t 
recognize any faces but faces do exist in the photo, no problem! — you 
can manually address them.
 
2. Click Photos in the Source list and select a photo that shows someone 
you want to name.
 
3. Click the Name button on the iPhoto toolbar, as shown in Figure 4-19.

77
 Chapter 4: Events and Faces — Grouping Your Photos
 
Select Faces to get started

Figure 4-19: The Name button in the toolbar.
 
4. A pane similar to the one in Figure 4-20 opens, displaying the photo.
 
 iPhoto will mark, with a pointer, each area it recognizes as a face. Each 
of these areas are marked as Unknown Face. As you move the mouse 
pointer over a face, a rectangle appears.
 
5. Click the words Unknown Face, type in the person’s name (Debbie, as 
shown in Figure 4-21), and then press Return.
 
 If there is more than one face and you know all the names, add them the 
same way. However, you don’t have to name every face; you can remove 
the face-positioning rectangle from any face you want to ignore. Simply 
click the face and then click the X in the rectangle.
 
6. Click Faces in the Source list to see how the corkboard has changed; 
see Figure 4-22.

10. To confirm the bottom photo, click the text Click to Confirm (directly 
beneath the photo), and then click the Done button in the bottom-
right corner of the pane.
 
 To confirm a photo, you can also just drag the photo above the dividing 
line.
 
11. (Optional) If this isn’t the correct person, click the bottom photo twice.
 
 Click to Confirm will change to Not Debbie, and the photo will not be 
added.

 Figure 4-26 shows the result of confirming the name in this example. 
Two photos are now identified as Debbie.
 
13. Click the All Faces button to stack the photos on the corkboard. To 
open them again, just double-click the stack — or tile, as it’s some-
times called.
 
 In the lower-left corner of the iPhoto toolbar is a button named View, 
with two halves. Clicking the right half shows the photos in Faces 
zoomed in as shown in Figure 4-26. To see the person as they appear in 
the original photo, click the left half of the button, which is the Photo 
View portion. Figure 4-27 shows the difference.
If you want to delete a stack from the Faces corkboard, drag the stack to the 
iPhoto Trash, or select the stack and choose Photos➪Move to Trash.

I
’m sure many of us have turned pages in an old photo album (or at least 
have seen relatives doing so). You might wonder about the relevance 
for albums in the digital world in which we live. This chapter has 
the answer.
If you’ve read this book to this point, you already know 
about Events and how iPhoto organizes your imports 
into Event-specific groupings. The order inside an 
Event, though, is governed by the order of import 
into iPhoto. You can’t really change that order after 
the fact. One of the benefits of an old, physical photo 
album was you could move your photos around 
until you had them in the order you wanted, and 
then paste them in place. In Events, you can’t really 
do that — but with iPhoto’s Albums feature, you can.
In addition to letting you manually change the order 
of photos, iPhoto’s Albums let you put multiple, often 
related, Events or photos into one place. So, for instance, you 
might have several Events representing your child’s birthdays 
over several years. With Albums, you can put them into one Album — say, 
called Johnny’s Birthdays or Megan’s Birthdays — and keep them all in one 
place, making them easy to find and view.
Take a look at how this all happens.

84
Part II: Manipulating Photo Organization 
Creating an Album
I want you to understand one very important point about Albums: No matter 
how many different Albums you put a photo into, the photo file is never stored 
in the iPhoto Library more than once. That means you’re not wasting space 
when you place a photo in more than one Album. This also means that if you 
delete a photo from an Album, the photo is still in the iPhoto Library — and 
still in its original Event. Great stuff, huh?
 
The reverse is not true. If you delete photos or Events from your iPhoto 
Library, they will automatically be deleted from any Album(s) they are in.
Albums always appear in the same place in iPhoto, in the section called 
Albums, in the Source list. When you create an Album, you can either select 
the individual photos or Events to put in it, or create the Album first and then 
add photos and Events.
 
If you start by choosing an Event, the Album you create will have the name 
of the Event as its name with the word Album appended: for example, April’s 
Birthday Album. Of course, you can change the name.
To create a standard Album without first selecting any photos or Events to 
place in it, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Add (the + symbol) button (on the small toolbar in the bot-
tom-left corner of the main iPhoto window).
 
 This brings up a dialog (shown in Figure 5-1). You can also choose 
File➪New Album to obtain the same dialog.
 
 
Figure 5-1: The Create New Album dialog.
 
2. Click the Album icon at the top of the dialog, type in the name you 
want to give the album (as shown in Figure 5-1), and then click the 
Create button.
 
 The check box labeled Use Selected Items in New Album will be dis-
cussed shortly. For now, leave it unchecked.

85
 Chapter 5: Combining Photos into Albums
 
 The new Album is created and now appears under Albums in the Source 
list.
 
3. To add content to the new Album, select and drag it into the new 
Album in the Source list.
 
 Figure 5-2 shows an Event selected and in the process of being dropped 
in the Album.
 
 
Figure 5-2: Placing content into an Album.
 
 In addition to selecting an entire Event and dragging it onto the Album, 
you can add content to an Album by
 
• Opening an Event, selecting just the photos, and dragging them onto 
the Album.
 
• Clicking Photos in the Source List, choosing what photos you want 
from the entire Library, and dragging your selections onto the Album.
 
 Figure 5-3 shows the resulting content of the Winter Workout album 
after dragging the one Event.
If you already selected the items you want to add into a new Album, follow 
these steps:
 
1. With the items you want to add to a new Album still selected, choose 
File➪New Album from Selection. Or, click the Add button.
 
 The dialog shown in Figure 5-1 appears.

86
Part II: Manipulating Photo Organization 
 
 
Figure 5-3: The newly added photos in the new Album.
 
2. Type in the name you want to give the new Album, make sure that the 
Use Selected Items in New Album check box is selected, and then click 
Create.
 
 The items you selected are added to the new Album, and the new 
Album’s name appears in the Source list, under Albums.
Here are some other ways to get content into an Album:
 
✓ Dragging from another Album: Dragging one or more photos from one 
Album into another will leave both Albums with the photos.
 
✓ Dragging from a CD, DVD, or hard disk: Adding photos from a CD, DVD, 
or hard disk (drive) to an Album will also cause the photos to be auto-
matically imported into the iPhoto Library, thus causing an Event (or 
Events) to be created as well. This happens because no photo can be in 
iPhoto unless it’s in the Library and is an Event.
 
✓ Dragging a folder of photos from the Finder into the Source list in 
iPhoto: This method actually creates a new Album instead of placing the 
content into an existing Album. The Album created will have the same 
name as the folder from the Finder. (This can be changed, of course.) 
Although all the photos will be in one Album, one or more Events will be 
created, depending on the Events Preferences settings for Autosplit into 
Events (see Chapter 2 for more details). If set for One Event Per Day, for 
instance, and the photos cover a span of two days, two Events will be 
created.
To delete an Album, select it in the Source list and do one of the following:
 
1. Drag the Album icon to the iPhoto Trash.
 
2. Right-click with your mouse (or Control-click) the Album icon and 
then choose Delete Album.

87
 Chapter 5: Combining Photos into Albums
 
3. Choose Photos➪Delete Album from the iPhoto menu.
 
 Performing any one of these actions will bring up the warning dialog 
shown in Figure 5-4.
 
 
Figure 5-4: This dialog appears when you delete an Album.
 
Deleting an Album or any photos in an Album does not delete anything from 
the iPhoto Library, as shown in Figure 5-4.
Making Smart Albums
The problem with Albums is that you must decide on the content it contains 
and manually make any modifications to the content either by adding or 
removing photos. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could decide, just once, what 
kind of photos you want to be in the album and forever after iPhoto would 
take care of things automatically? Well, your wish has been answered, and 
that answer is Smart Albums.
Smart Albums allow you to fill them with specific photos from your iPhoto 
Library, both now and in the future, based on such parameters as specific 
keywords, ratings, the specific type of camera, shutter speed, date captured, 
Faces, Places, and many more.
As you can imagine, the possibilities are nearly endless. And the best part is 
that this is all done automatically: Photos that qualify are added; those that 
don’t qualify aren’t. No dragging or selecting of individual photos is necessary.
 
If you haven’t already, create useful keywords for your photos so the Smart 
Album has something to work with. Adding and editing keywords is dis-
cussed in Chapter 3.
To create a Smart Album, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Add (the + symbol) button to open the dialog shown in 
Figure 5-5. Then click the Smart Album icon at the top of the dialog.

88
Part II: Manipulating Photo Organization 
 
 You can also choose File➪New Smart Album; or right-click (Control-
click) in the empty space in the Source list and then choose New Smart 
Album to open the same dialog.
 
 
Figure 5-5: The Create New Smart Album dialog.
 
2. Type a name for the Smart Album.
 
 I’m calling mine Winter Workout.
 
3. Begin to set up your photo-candidate expressions — filters — for the 
Smart Album by making a selection from the first pop-up menu.
 
 Each expression contains an entry from each of the pop-up menus and 
tells iPhoto what photos qualify to be in this particular Smart Album, 
now and in the future. Be aware that even if you select a number of 
photos for a Smart Album but some of them don’t fulfill the expression, 
they won’t appear in the Smart Album.
 
 I’m going to choose Keyword as the first part for this example. Some 
other choices are filename, title, date, place, description, camera model, 
and quite a few more.
 
4. Select a verb from the second pop-up menu.
 
 These choices will vary, depending on your choice from the first menu.
 
 I’m going to select Is, for this example.
 
 What the third pop-up menu contains is dependent upon the selections 
you make in the first two pop-up menus. Because I chose Keywords and 
Is, the third pop-up menu contains a listing of all the keywords that have 
been used in my iPhoto Library, as shown in Figure 5-6. Your list will be 
different.
 
5. Make a selection from the third pop-up menu.
 
 I’m selecting Snowfall. Suppose you want to have several expressions 
that must be satisfied before a photo can appear in the Smart Album? No 
problem.

89
 Chapter 5: Combining Photos into Albums
 
 
Figure 5-6: Choose from a list of keywords.
 
6. Click the Add (the + symbol) button to the right of the expression you 
just completed to add another expression to the Smart Album.
 
 Again, choose from the three pop-up menus to complete the expression. 
For this example, I made a second expression by choosing Keyword, Is, 
and Oregon. Figure 5-7 shows the two expressions for the Smart Album.
 
 When you add a second expression, a new pop-menu appears above the 
expressions. This menu gives you the choice of whether All or Any of 
the expressions have to be true for the photo to qualify for inclusion. 
In Figure 5-7, it’s set for All, which means that both expressions must 
be true.
 
 
Figure 5-7: The Create Smart Album dialog with expressions added.
 
7. Click OK when you’re finished adding expressions and ready to create 
the Smart Album.

90
Part II: Manipulating Photo Organization 
 
 The Smart Album with the name you assigned will be created in the 
Source list and populated, automatically, with every photo in the iPhoto 
Library that satisfies the expressions you created, as shown in Figure 5-8.
 
 The icon for a Smart Album has a gear on it to make it easier to 
distinguish.
 
The new Smart Album
 
Figure 5-8: The new Smart Album and its contents.
This is very cool stuff, and it just keeps getting better. The Smart Album gets 
updated automatically and instantly whenever a photo that matches your 
Smart Album settings (in the example, it would be the keywords of Snowfall 
and Oregon) is added or removed from your iPhoto Library. If you find 
another photo that belongs in a Smart Album, make the necessary edits to 
meet the Smart Album’s conditions, and it will be added to the Smart Album 
(in the example, it would require adding the keywords Snowfall and Oregon 
to the photo in the Library).
 
Because of this capability, I recommend adding keywords, Places, Faces, or 
any other descriptor to all your photos when you import them (see Chapter 
3 for more details). Then later, when you want to get them into separate 
Albums, just make your Smart Album settings, and it’s done.
Editing Smart Albums
There are several ways to edit the content of Smart Albums. When you edit a 
photo in your iPhoto Library, as soon as you exit Edit mode, iPhoto replaces 
the previous version of the photo in your Smart Album(s) with the new, 
edited version of the photo. You never have to worry about getting things out 

91
 Chapter 5: Combining Photos into Albums
of sync. You can also change a Smart Album’s expressions to edit the content 
it contains.
To edit the expressions of a Smart Album, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Source list, select the Smart Album you want to change and 
then choose File➪Edit Smart Album.
 
 You can also right-click (Control-click) the Smart Album in the Source 
list and then choose Edit Smart Album.
 
2. The dialog (refer to Figure 5-7) opens, from which you can change, 
add, or remove expressions to change the content of the album.
 
• To change an expression, use the pop-up menus and choose a dif-
ferent item from the list.
 
• To add an expression, click the Add (the + symbol) button next 
to an expression and begin entering the information for a new 
expression.
 
• To remove an expression, click the Remove (the – symbol) button 
next to the expression. It will be removed.
 
3. Click OK when you’re finished — and watch the fun begin.
 
 Depending on how you set your expressions in Step 2, the number of 
photos in the Smart Album will increase, decrease, or go to zero.
Using Places and Faces to Create Smart Albums
Among the newer capabilities in iPhoto are technologies called Places and 
Faces. (I discuss these in detail in Chapters 3 and 4.) With these capabilities, 
you can create Smart Albums that automatically contain only photos of par-
ticular people or locations. How great is that?
 
In Chapter 3, I discuss that in order to see and use the Maps capability in 
Places, you must be connected to the Internet. You might want to read that 
chapter (if you haven’t already) or at least keep that fact in mind.
To use Places (when you’re connected to the Internet) to create a Smart 
Album, follow these steps:
 
1. Select Places from the Source list.
 
2. Make sure the View button in the bottom-left corner of the Places 
pane has the left side of the button (World View) selected.
 
 You see a map showing pins at locations for your photos that have GPS 
information, as shown in Figure 5-9.

92
Part II: Manipulating Photo Organization 
 
 
Figure 5-9: The Places pane showing locations on the map.
 
 Notice in Figure 5-9 the Zoom All button on the toolbar. This is used 
when you want to see all the pins for all the locations you have set. 
When you click this button, the map automatically zooms out and shows 
all your pin locations.
 
 Click the Show Photos button to change the pane from displaying the 
map to display all the photos for the locations that were currently vis-
ible on the map. Very handy. To go back to Map view, click the large 
arrow icon named Map in the upper-left corner of the pane.
 
3. With the map displayed in the pane, select a specific location by click-
ing the appropriate red pin.
 
 The pin turns blue, and the location attached to it will show up, as 
shown in Figure 5-10.
 
 If you want to use a region or country instead of a specific Place pin 
to create a new Smart Album, use the zoom slider in the bottom-right 
corner to zoom in and out, and then drag the map around until only 
those locations you’re interested in are showing on the map (as shown 
in Figure 5-11).
 
4. Click the Smart Album button at the bottom of the pane.
 
 A new Smart Album appears in the Source list, and the pane displays the 
photos it contains.
 
5. Type a different name for the Smart Album.
 
 In the example in Figure 5-12, I named the Smart Album with the name of 
the location where the photos were taken.

The new Smart Album
 
Figure 5-12: The new Smart Album based on a Place.
If you’re not connected to the Internet, don’t worry. Even though the map 
won’t display in the Places pane, you can still create Smart Albums using the 
Places feature by following these steps:
 
1. Click the Add (the + symbol) button.
 
2. In the dialog that opens, click the Smart Album icon at the top of the 
dialog, type a name for the Smart Album, and set the expression for 
the Smart Album (see Figure 5-13) as follows:
 
a. Choose Place from the first pop-up menu.
 
b. Choose Contains from the second pop-up menu.
 
c. Type the name of the place on which you want to base the Smart 
Album.
 
3. Click OK.
 
 A new Smart Album appears in the Source list, as shown in Figure 5-14.
What a great way to organize photos from different locations — and it’s easy, 
too! Like all Smart Albums, as photos get added to your Library with these 
locations, they’re automatically added to the appropriate Smart Album.

So, how about Smart Albums for Faces? Yes, iPhoto has them, too. Again, there 
are three ways to use Faces to create Smart Ablums. Here’s the first way:
 
1. Select Faces in the Source list to open the Faces pane, as shown in 
Figure 5-15.
 
2. The easiest way to create a Smart Album is to drag the Faces tile (in 
the example, Debbie) to an empty space in the Source list (in this case, 
at the bottom of the Source list).

96
Part II: Manipulating Photo Organization 
 
 Magically, a Smart Album named Debbie appears under Albums, as 
shown in Figure 5-16.
 
 Couldn’t be easier.
 
 
Figure 5-15: The Faces pane.
 
The new Smart Album
 
Figure 5-16: The new Smart Album based on a Face.

97
 Chapter 5: Combining Photos into Albums
The second way to use Faces to create a Smart Album is to select the Faces 
tile of the person from the Faces pane and then click the Smart Album button 
at the bottom on the toolbar. The results are identical — a new Smart Album 
based on the selected Face is created.
The last way to do this is the same way I show you how to create regular 
Smart Albums, earlier in this chapter:
 
1. Click the Add (the + symbol) button.
 
2. Click Smart Album icon on the top of the dialog and then type a name.
 
3. Choose Name from the first pop-up menu, Contains from the second 
menu, and then type the name of the person in Faces that you want to 
create the Smart Album for.
 
 If you want to collect photos that have more than one person, make sure 
you set the Match pop-up menu to
 
• Any: To collect photos that show any of the named people
 
• All: To show only photos where all named people are present
 
4. To add more people, click the plus sign next to your first condition 
and repeat Step 3.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 The Smart Album appears.
Using Faces and Places is not only fun, but makes keeping track of your favor-
ite people a lot easier.
Organizing Your Albums
As your collection of photographs grows and you create more Albums and 
Smart Albums, your Source list might get very crowded.
If that’s the case for you, consider grouping several albums together that 
have something in common. For this purpose, you can create folders in the 
Source list. To do this, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪New Folder, or right-click (Control-click) in an empty 
space in the Source list, and then choose New Folder.
 
 Folders are always created under the heading Albums in the Source list, 
as shown in Figure 5-17.

98
Part II: Manipulating Photo Organization 
 
Creating a new folder
 
Figure 5-17: A new, untitled folder.
 
2. Name the folder as you wish and then press Return.
 
 For this example, I’m naming it Combo.
 
3. Now just drag an Album(s), regular or Smart, into the folder.
 
 Folders can also be embedded within other folders. To do this, repeat 
Steps 1 and 2 and then drag the second folder you created into the first 
folder you created.
 
4. The Albums appear indented under the folder, as shown in Figure 
5-18.
 
 Clicking the arrow beside the folder closes it and also saves viewing 
space in the Source list.
 
 
Figure 5-18: Three Albums in one folder.
Changing the Photo Order in Albums
The ability to change the order of photos in Albums depends upon the type 
of Album you’re dealing with. You can change the order in standard Albums 
in three ways:
 
✓ Use the View menu in iPhoto and sort the photos by one of the follow-
ing criteria:
 
• Date
 
• Title
 
• Rating
 
• Keywords

99
 Chapter 5: Combining Photos into Albums
 
✓ After you select the criteria, you can sort the photos in ascending or 
descending order.
 
✓ You can also very quickly try different photo orderings by simply 
dragging photos within the Album and placing them where you want 
them to appear.
The order of photos in Smart Albums can be changed using the first two 
methods for standard Albums — by Date, Title, Rating, and Keywords; and by 
ascending or descending order.
However, in Smart Albums, you can’t manually drag the photos into a dif-
ferent sort order. (No manual operations of that type are allowed in Smart 
Albums.) About the only thing you can do is to perhaps add a numeric key-
word to each photo (for this to work, the numeric keyword must be the first 
Keyword for the photo), then view the photos based on Keyword and sort 
them in Ascending order to force the photos to be sorted in a numerical 
order you have contrived.
Removing Photos from One or More Albums
There are significant differences in how deleting photos works in standard 
Albums and Smart Albums.
To delete a photo or photos from a standard Album
 
1. Select the Album from the Source list.
 
2. Click appropriately to select the photos to be deleted.
 
3. Press the Delete key on the keyboard to remove the photos from 
(only) that Album, or drag the photo(s) to the Trash in the Source list.
 
 The photo(s) will be removed from the Album but will not appear in the 
Trash in the Source list — you are removing them only from the Album 
and not from the Library. As usual, you can choose Edit➪Undo to restore 
the photo(s) to the album.
 
Because standard Albums are populated manually by you, removing the 
instance of a photo from one Album does not remove it from any other stan-
dard Album or from the iPhoto Library.
Deleting a photo or photos from a Smart Album requires more effort and 
more care. Remember that Smart Albums content is created automatically 
based on conditions that you set. You can’t just drag a photo to the Trash 
because the very next time that the conditions are checked in the iPhoto 
Library, that photo would qualify and would be placed back in the Smart 
Album you had just deleted it from. There are three ways to remove a photo 
from a Smart Album:

100
Part II: Manipulating Photo Organization 
 
✓ Change the criteria in a photo that’s causing a match, such as the key-
word, rating, description, or whatever is causing the photo to be in 
the Smart Album.
 
✓ Change some part of the expressions for the Smart Album to exclude 
the photo or photos you want to remove from it.
 
 You could include a expression that uses Is Not to pinpoint the photo 
or photos to be excluded. An example of an edited set of conditions is 
shown in Figure 5-19. In the example, if any photo has the title Snowfall2, 
it will be excluded from the Smart Album.
 
✓ Do what I call a “special delete” that removes the photo from the 
Library.
 
 This special delete will remove the photo from the iPhoto Library and 
thus from every Album in which it appears. After the Trash is emptied, 
there is no Undo.
 
Using the Is Not condition to remove a photo from a Smart Album
 
Figure 5-19: Excluding a photo from the Smart Album.
To do the special delete, follow these steps:
 
1. Click on the Smart Album in the Source List to see the contents. Select 
the photo or photos to be deleted.
 
2. Press and hold Ô+Opt+Delete.
 
 The photo or photos will appear in the Trash in the Source list.
 
3. If you change your mind, choose Edit➪Undo Move to Trash, and the 
photo will be restored to the Smart Album. Otherwise, empty the 
Trash to complete the operation.

Searching for Your Photos
In This Chapter
▶ Searching based on photo properties
▶ Using complex keyword searches to find photos
▶ Making sure you have something to search for
D
epending on the size of your iPhoto Library (or libraries; I talk about 
multiple iPhoto libraries in Chapter 3), you might have a difficult time 
finding that one photo you’re looking for. You can organize your photos in 
lots of ways so that the iPhoto main window doesn’t look so cluttered. (See 
Chapters 4 and 5.) When you’re searching, somewhere within all that orga-
nization is the one photo you’re looking for. The question is how to find it 
easily and efficiently.
The good news is that this chapter shows you a number of 
ways to find what you’re looking for — including one I tell 
you about that isn’t really documented.
The chapter concludes with helping you ensure that 
you’ll always have something to search for. I know 
you’ve probably heard that backing up is vital — 
I’m restating the obvious. But believe me, the exas-
peration you might feel at having this repeated to 
you is nothing compared with the feeling of despair 
and helplessness you’ll experience when you 
search for a photo you cherish only to find out that 
it has disappeared and is irretrievable.
In this chapter, I first show you some search methods. 
Then, I deal with backup techniques to keep your precious 
photos safe.

102
Part II: Manipulating Photo Organization 
Using Photo Properties to Narrow Your Search
Whether your iPhoto Library is very large, it’s always a good idea to have 
the capability of searching quickly for the photo or photos you need to find. 
iPhoto’s capabilities allow you to search using text, keywords, dates, and 
ratings, in addition to some more complex search methods. (See the section 
“Constructing Complex Keyword Searches” later in this chapter.)
 
For any search, if you have knowledge that the photo you’re looking for is in a 
particular Event (or any other type of grouping, such as Faces, Places, Albums, 
or folders), you can narrow the search by concentrating on just that Event.
 
Before performing your search, it’s also helpful to choose View from the iPhoto 
menu and select the options to have iPhoto display titles, keywords, and rating 
for each photo. This allows you to get more information from the search, and it 
can help you more easily decide when you have what you want.
Searching based on text
You use the Search field located beneath the iPhoto toolbar at the bottom 
of the iPhoto main window (see Figure 6-1) to search the Library for photos. 
To search for text assigned to a photo, you must select All from the Search 
field pop-up menu. iPhoto then searches the title, description, keywords, and 
rating of the photos in the Library for the text you key in. As you’re typing 
text in the Search field, iPhoto works with whatever you’ve typed and finds 
as many photos that match.
To find a photo using text, follow these steps:
 
1. Select Photos from the Source list to set the scope of the search.
 
 You can narrow the focus of the search by selecting another Source in 
the list, such as Events or Last 12 Months, if you’re sure that what you’re 
looking for is contained there.
 
2. Choose the All option from the Search field pop-up menu. Then, in the 
Search field, type the word or phrase that you’re searching for.
 
 For this example, I’m searching for the word winter.
 
 iPhoto begins to display photos that match the term you’re entering 
after just a few letters.
 
 As shown in Figure 6-2, I’ve typed only win, and iPhoto is already start-
ing to find and retrieve photos. At the bottom of the window, you see 
that eight photos qualify at this point. They have the letters win in their 
titles, descriptions, dates, keywords, and/or ratings.

3. To guarantee that you get only results that perfectly match your 
search, finishing typing the entire search term.
 
 As you can see in Figure 6-3, I added another letter to the Search field (it 
now reads wint), and the search continues to narrow the results.
 
 
Figure 6-3: Final candidates for text search.
 
4. Continue typing the search term until the photo(s) that you’re looking 
for is displayed in the results.
 
 You might find the photo(s) that you’re looking for after typing just a 
few letters, but typing all the letters in your search term provides exact 
results.
 
5. To cancel the search and begin again, simply click the Reset button 
(the X in the far-right side of the Search field).
What about searching for photos based on other types of photo properties? 
You continue to use the Search field and set its pop-up menu to those proper-
ties you want to search. Read on.
Searching based on dates
Say, for instance, you want to search for a photo based on a certain date. To 
do so, follow these steps.

105
 Chapter 6: Searching for Your Photos
 
1. In the Source list, choose the Source you want to search within, such 
as Events or Photos.
 
2. Set the pop-up menu in the Search field to Date.
 
 You’ll see all the months for a particular year listed. If you don’t, just 
click the small button in the top-left corner of the calendar, and the year 
appears. The months that are highlighted actually have photos in your 
Library with those dates, as shown in Figure 6-4.
 
 
Figure 6-4: Using the year calendar for a date search.
 
3. Choose a month to search by clicking it.
 
 Use the right arrow and the left arrow at the top-right side of the calendar 
to cycle through the months of the year. As you might have guessed, high-
lighted dates mean that you have photos for those dates. See Figure 6-5.
 
4. Click a day in the month, and the photos that match appear, as shown 
in Figure 6-6.
 
5. To select more than one consecutive date, press and hold the Shift key 
and then select the beginning and ending date.
 
 All dates between the beginning and ending date are automatically be 
selected, and the search results are displayed.

107
 Chapter 6: Searching for Your Photos
 
6. To select nonconsecutive dates, press and hold the Ô key and then 
select dates.
 
 Only the dates selected are highlighted, and the displayed results 
encompass only those dates.
 
7. To cancel the search and begin again, simply click the Reset button 
(the X in the far-right of the Search field).
You have to admit that even just searching by text or date can make retriev-
ing your photos of interest a lot easier. But there’s more. Read on for details 
on keyword searching.
Searching based on keywords
Keywords are labels that you can add to your photos to provide additional 
information about the subject of the photo — and, more importantly, make 
searches for particular photos more efficient.
 
Keywords are usually added to photos when you import them into iPhoto, 
but you can also add or edit them at any time. (See Chapter 3 for instruc-
tions.) Why edit them? Well, during import, you might add many keywords 
at one time, and it could be that you misspelled a few. (You won’t get many 
search hits that way.) Or you might later discover that a keyword isn’t spe-
cific enough, making the search less effective.
Okay, now I tell you how to use keywords to retrieve the photo or photos you 
want to find. To search based on keywords, follow these steps:
 
1. Select either Events or Photos from the Source list.
 
2. Set the pop-up menu in the Search field to select Keyword.
 
 A list of all the keywords in your iPhoto Library appears.
 
3. Hover your mouse over each keyword, and the indicator tells you how 
many photos have that keyword, as shown in Figure 6-7.
 
 Notice that because no keyword is selected at this point, the iPhoto 
main window shows all the Events and their content.
 
4. Select the keyword you wish to use for the search.
 
 In this example, I clicked Crater Lake, and the photo with that keyword 
appeared, as shown in Figure 6-8.
 
5. To cancel the search and begin again, simply click the Reset button 
(an X on the right side of the Search field).
You can construct more complex keyword searches. See the “Constructing 
Complex Keyword Searches” section later in this chapter for more details.

 Chapter 6: Searching for Your Photos
Searching based on ratings
iPhoto’s Ratings scheme is based on 1–5 stars, and like most other proper-
ties for photos, you can set or change them at any time. The ratings are, of 
course, completely subjective, but they can help at editing time to cull those 
you think are worthy of further work. Setting the ratings is discussed in 
Chapter 3.
iPhoto gives you two ways to search based on ratings:
 
✓ Choose elect All from the Search field pop-up menu. In the Search 
field, type the number of stars you’re searching for.
 
 You enter a star in the Search field by pressing Shift+8 on the keyboard.
 
✓ Choose elect Rating from the Search field pop-up menu and click the 
number of stars you’re searching for in the Search field.
 
It’s important to realize that these two ways, although they seem very simi-
lar, provide different results, as I’m about to show you.
Here’s how to perform a search based on ratings using the first method I just 
mentioned:
 
1. Make sure the pop-up menu for the Search field is set to All.
 
2. Press Shift+8 to begin entering the number of stars you want to 
search for.
 
 iPhoto returns results for only those photos with exactly that rating.
 
 Figure 6-9 shows a sample result for a one-star search.
This means that if you want to find an exact match to the rating entered, you 
should type it in. But what happens if you use the second method? iPhoto 
shows you all photos with the range of stars that you select. For example, 
you can choose to display all photos with at least three stars, which will 
show you all those photos with three, four or five stars.
To perform a search based on rating using the second method, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Set the Search field pop-up menu to Rating.
 
2. Using the mouse, click the first of the five indicators (they look like 
dots) in the Search field.
 
 The indicator (dot) changes to a star. If you click the second indicator, 
the first two indicators change to stars, and so on.
 
 iPhoto’s results show all photos with at least one star, as shown in the 
example in Figure 6-10.

110
Part II: Manipulating Photo Organization 
 
 
Figure 6-9: Results from typing one star in the Search field.
 
 
Figure 6-10: Results of setting the Search field to Rating and indicating one star.

111
 Chapter 6: Searching for Your Photos
 
 If you clicked the second indicator in Step 2, the results would show 
all photos with at least two stars. (Photos with only one star would not 
appear in the results.) That’s quite a difference from the first method.
So, iPhoto gives you two methods for searching by Rating, one exclusive and 
one inclusive. Choose wisely when using these search methods.
Searching based on location
There’s a convenient new tool in the Places feature that allows searching 
based on the locations that you or the camera have set in your photos. It’s 
quick and simple to use, and very handy. (See Chapter 3 for more information 
about using the Places feature.)
To search based on location, follow these steps:
 
1. Click Places in the Source list.
 
2. Click the right half of the View button on the toolbar to bring up the 
Location browser, as shown in Figure 6-11.
 
 The Location browser lists all the locations that you or the camera have 
entered in your iPhoto Library.
 
Click this side of the View button to…
…open the Location browser
 
Figure 6-11: Using the View button to open the Location browser.

112
Part II: Manipulating Photo Organization 
 
3. Click the location that you’re searching for, and the results are dis-
played, as shown in Figure 6-12.
 
 When the Location browser first appears, it shows all photos from 
all locations. Each column breaks the locations down further so that 
specific places and their associated photos are easier to find. In the 
example in Figure 6-12, the first column lists United States. The second 
column breaks down United States into California and Oregon: The coun-
try in column one is divided into that country’s states in column two. 
You can see that column three breaks the states into cities, and column 
four breaks the cities into places within those cities.
 
 
Figure 6-12: Selecting the location you want.
One more tool (the complex Keyword search) can make your photographic 
life simpler and more efficient.
Constructing Complex Keyword Searches
Earlier in this chapter, in the “Searching based on keywords” section, I men-
tion a more complex keyword search. That section tells you how it’s possible 
to use keywords to search for photos based on single and multiple keywords. 
But what if you need to be a little more exclusive than that? No problem. You 

113
 Chapter 6: Searching for Your Photos
can use three special keys to construct more complex keyword searches. The 
keys are
 
✓ Shift key: Represents the logical operator OR
 
✓ Option key: Represents the logical operator NOT
 
✓ Control key: Represents the logical operator AND
This means that you can create a search that says something like, “Show me 
all the photos that have keywords scenic AND Oregon and NOT snowfall.” In 
fact, I try that out in the steps that follow to show you what happens.
To perform a complex keyword search using the OR, NOT, and AND opera-
tors, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Keyword from the Search field’s pop-up menu, and then select 
a keyword.
 
 In this example, I selected scenic for the first keyword, and three photos 
match the search criteria so far, as shown in Figure 6-13.
 
 
Figure 6-13: Select the first keyword.
 
2. Press and hold the Control key to add the AND operator, and then 
click the second keyword.
 
 I selected Oregon for the second keyword. Because I held the Control 
key when selecting the second keyword, the AND operator is applied, 

114
Part II: Manipulating Photo Organization 
and a search string of Oregon and scenic is created. The number of quali-
fying photos is now two, as shown in Figure 6-14.
 
 As you hover your mouse over a keyword, a white box appears telling 
you how many photos in the Library contain that keyword. When per-
forming a complex keyword search, don’t confuse this number with the 
number of photos in the Library that actually match the complex key-
word search string. This number is listed as the Library totals. (Refer to 
the figure on the Cheat Sheet, located at the front of this book.)
 
 
Figure 6-14: Using the AND operator in a keyword search.
 
3. Press and hold the Option key to add the NOT operator, and select the 
third keyword.
 
 I selected snowfall for the third keyword. Because I held the Option key 
when selecting the third keyword, the NOT operator is applied, and the 
words and not snowfall are added to the end of the search string, thus 
cutting the number of qualifying photos to one, as shown in Figure 6-15.
 
Always check the text that appears in the Search field while you’re clicking 
keywords to set up the search. Make sure that iPhoto is setting up the search 
how you want it.

 Chapter 6: Searching for Your Photos
 
 
Figure 6-15: Adding the NOT operator to the search.
Ensuring You Have Something to Search For
Searching for particular photos in what may be a large iPhoto Library is a 
fairly common occurrence. iPhoto has great capabilities for finding exactly 
the photos you’re looking for — if they exist. Ooh, maybe you haven’t 
thought a lot about that situation, but I assure you that it’s an all-too-
common occurrence. You might have inadvertently deleted a photo, or 
maybe a software glitch corrupted part or all of the Library. If that’s the case, 
it doesn’t matter how extensive the search capabilities are in iPhoto; they 
just won’t get you the results you want. So what can you do to prevent this? 
Back up your iPhoto Library regularly.
Saving changes
If you’ve been using iPhoto, you might have noticed that you haven’t been 
using a Save command as you usually do with software packages. iPhoto 
does several things for you to make the environment more secure, including 
the following:
 
✓ iPhoto automatically saves changes to anything you work on (a photo, 
Event, Album, and so on) as you work. This frees you to concentrate on 
your artistic endeavors rather than the administration of your Library. 
This is why there’s no Save command in iPhoto.
 
✓ iPhoto lets you revert to the original version of the photo. While you’re 
working on a photo, you can choose Photos➪Revert to Original and get 

116
Part II: Manipulating Photo Organization 
back to square one. This is a wonderful feature when you decide to try 
some new editing technique but discover that it’s a disaster.
 
✓ iPhoto makes Library backup and switching easy. I discuss this in 
Chapter 3, but it’s important enough to go over these details again. See 
the next section.
Backing up your iPhoto Library
I can’t emphasize enough the need to make Library backup something you 
routinely do. And it’s a great opportunity to use iCal (or any other calendar 
software you use) to remind you to perform the backup. How often you do a 
backup is really an individual choice. Do it often enough to give you a warm 
and comfy feeling, whether that’s once weekly, once monthly, or once every 
three months. The more valuable your photos, the more often you should 
back them up. And the more photos you upload between backup intervals, 
the more you have to lose.
The iPhoto Library is located on your computer in the Pictures folder, and 
it’s aptly named iPhoto Library.
You can use any of these three main ways to back up your Library:
 
✓ Copy the iPhoto Library to another disk.
 
✓ Copy the iPhoto Library to a CD or DVD.
 
✓ Use Apple’s Time Machine software (if you’re running Mac OS X ver-
sion 10.5 or later) or another backup solution (like the Backup pro-
gram that comes with MobileMe).
Copying onto another disk is fairly straightforward. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Go to your Pictures folder on your computer and select the iPhoto 
Library file.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Copy iPhoto Library, as shown in Figure 6-16.
 
 
Figure 6-16: Copying the Library from the Edit menu.

117
 Chapter 6: Searching for Your Photos
 
3. In the Finder, select the disk to which you want to copy, and then 
choose Edit➪Paste Item.
 
 This stores a copy of your iPhoto Library on the selected disk. 
Remember where this is. (You might want to put the copy into a new 
folder you create, called My iPhoto Backup or something similar.)
To copy your iPhoto Library onto a CD or DVD (depending on how large your 
Library is), do the following:
 
1. Go to your Pictures folder on your computer and select the iPhoto 
Library file.
 
2. In the Finder, choose File➪Burn iPhoto Library to Disc, as shown in 
Figure 6-17.
 
 
Figure 6-17: Starting the burn process.
 
3. When the Burn Disc dialog appears, insert an appropriate, blank disc.
 
4. When the next dialog appears (see Figure 6-18), type a descriptive 
name for the CD or DVD in the Disc Name field, select an appropriate 
burn speed, and then click Burn.

118
Part II: Manipulating Photo Organization 
 
 
Figure 6-18: Naming the backup CD or DVD.
Last, but certainly not least, you can do backups using Apple’s Time Machine 
software, if you’re running Mac OS X version 10.5 or later. You might already 
use it — in which case, there’s nothing to do. Saving iPhoto and the Library is 
done at whatever interval you have set for Time Machine. Time Machine uses 
a separate hard disk to back up your entire hard disk — or some portion of it 
that you specify. It keeps
 
✓ Hourly backups for the past 24 hours
 
✓ Daily backups for the past month
 
✓ Weekly backups until your backup disk is full
 
The operation of Time Machine is described under Mac Help on your 
Macintosh computer and on the Apple Web site. (Description of all Time 
Machine topics and uses are beyond the scope of this book — check one of 
the two mentioned locations. You can also check out Mac OS X Leopard All-in-
One Desk Reference For Dummies, by Mark L. Chambers, Wiley.)
Accessing the backup information on Time Machine is easy. Follow these 
steps:
 
1. With iPhoto open, choose File➪Browse Backups.
 
2. When Time Machine opens, you can select dates in the past where a 
lost or corrupted photo exists and retrieve that information.

Making Your 
Photos Look 
Even Better

I
n this part, I show you how to get the most 
bang out of the photos you’ve taken and give 
you some tips for making those you take in the 
future the best that they can be. How do I do that?
Chapter 7 shows you how the powerful iPhoto 
Editor works and how to get the most out of it and 
your photos. And I give you the ﬁ xes for the most 
common problems affecting photos in Chapter 8. 
Sometimes that’s enough, but if not, Chapters 9 
and 10 show you how to use iPhoto’s advanced 
tools to work magic — including changing color 
and light levels, correcting exposure (after you 
take the photo, that is), modifying color saturation 
levels, sharpening, and a host of other profes-
sional adjustments — to raise your photographic 
experience to the highest level.
Then, just for fun, you see how selected effects 
can make your photos more interesting and 
rewarding.

Exploring the iPhoto Editor
In This Chapter
▶ Taking a look at the power of the Editor
▶ Full-screen editing
▶ Trying edits until they’re right — Redo, Undo, and Revert to Original
▶ Editing multiple photos the easy way
T
he iPhoto Editor is a combination of one-click, quick-fix tools and 
advanced editing capabilities for everything from exposure and satura-
tion to noise reduction and color balance. No matter what level of editing you 
need to perform, the iPhoto Editor provides the tools.
If you’ve already been through Chapter 2, you completed a simple iPhoto 
project and were introduced to some of the editing tools avail-
able. In this chapter, I show you in more depth how to use all 
the editing tools.
Sometimes, because of the subject or the lighting, 
you have to quickly take a photo. You just might not 
have time to get the composition precisely how you 
want it. iPhoto can help you compensate for that, 
too, allowing compositional changes after the fact.
That’s enough talk — time to get busy understand-
ing how to make your photos better.
Understanding the Editor
Taking the perfect photograph is a lofty goal and nearly impos-
sible. Light never falls evenly on all parts of a photo, or you make a 
simple error in camera settings in the heat of the picture-taking moment, or 
your composition isn’t quite right.

122
Part III: Making Your Photos Look Even Better 
Luckily, almost all these errors can be corrected, at least to some extent. 
Figure 7-1 shows the main window in Edit mode, and this is where the magic 
happens.
Take note of the little Navigation window, which appears any time you 
zoom in within the photo. Sometimes you zoom in so much to make a cor-
rection that you lose track of where you are in the photo — and that’s what 
the Navigation window is for. You can put the mouse inside it and click 
and drag to move the photo around. Or, you can put it away by clicking the 
Close button in its upper-left corner. If you don’t zoom, you don’t see the 
Navigation window.
 
 
Figure 7-1: iPhoto’s main window in Edit mode.
About this time, you might be muttering something like, “So many tools, so 
little time.” Well, don’t worry. Stay right here for my tips on how I approach 
editing every photo. I’m sure these tips will help you, too.
Here’s an overview of my approach to editing. I start with what I call the 
“tidying-up phase”:
 
1. I select the photo to edit and then click the Edit button in the toolbar at 
the bottom of the iPhoto main window.
 
 If necessary, I use the Rotate button to rotate the photo.
 
 Pressing and holding the Option key when clicking the Rotate button will 
change the direction of the rotation.

123
 Chapter 7: Exploring the iPhoto Editor
 
2. There’s no sense working on parts of a photo that I don’t want, so I use 
the Crop button and crop the photo, if required, before doing anything 
else.
 
3. Finally, I straighten the photo, if necessary, using the Straighten button.
Although this upfront part of the photo-editing process might not seem very 
exciting or artistic, tidying up is important and will save you time later. You’ll 
see what I mean when you read Chapter 8.
After tidying up, I decide how much editing I will do with the specific photo. 
The next group of tools — Enhance, Red-Eye, and Retouch (see Chapter 8 for 
more details) — can often be used when higher-level editing is not required. 
I call these tools E.R.R. (and to err is not only human, it is often enough for 
your photo).
How do you know whether using these tools will be enough to fix your photo? 
Well, you can certainly try them and use the Undo feature if they don’t work 
out. It’s really a matter of judgment based on experience and whether you 
like the look of what has been changed. If I decide to use these tools, here’s 
how I use them:
 
1. I normally start with the Red-Eye tool if there are any people in the 
photo with this problem.
 
2. Next I use the Retouch tool to remove any blemishes or dust spots that 
were on the lens — and thus in the photo. These two tools (Red-Eye and 
Retouch) are necessary whether you’re planning to use the Enhance tool 
(see the next bullet) or not. Even if you’re going to do advanced editing, 
you want to use these two tools first.
 
3. Last, but certainly not least, I click the Enhance button. This tool bright-
ens the picture and makes contrast changes to lighten the mood of the 
photo. There are no adjustments you can make, and one click is all you 
need.
But say you have a few photos that are your prizes — the ones you want 
to look as good as possible — and you don’t mind spending more time and 
care getting them to look the way you want. You’ve done your tidying up, 
and used Red-Eye, Retouch, and Enhance. Now, click the Adjust button, and 
the world of advanced photo editing opens. Figure 7-2 shows the Adjust tool 
window. Check out the ten sliders here that you can use to modify exposure, 
contrast, saturation, and a host of other parameters. Chapter 10 is devoted to 
using the Adjust tool.
When you finish using the Adjust tool, you might want to revisit the earlier-
mentioned tools to correct any errors just discovered. Otherwise, you’re 
ready to print or display.

This is my overall workflow with iPhoto. I recommend trying editing this way 
first to see how it works for you. Afterward, don’t hesitate to modify it to suit 
yourself — but do that based on your experience.
This approach covers a lot of work, but what if you decide at some point you 
don’t want any of these changes? Good question, and it deserves an answer 
right now.
Preserving the original photo
iPhoto uses a technique called nondestructive editing to ensure that your 
original photo’s look and feel is never lost. Instead of changing your photo 
directly, iPhoto keeps track of your modifications (keeping a list of things to 
do) and applies them to your original photo each time you open it for view-
ing, further editing, or printing. Operating in this way has several advantages:
 
✓ You can use the Undo and Redo features multiple times in any editing 
session without fear of corrupting the original photo.
 
✓ At any time after editing, you can choose Photos➪Revert to Original 
and go back to square one. Figure 7-3 shows the warning dialog after 
this choice is made.

125
 Chapter 7: Exploring the iPhoto Editor
 
 
Figure 7-3: Heed the Revert to Original warning.
 
 After you go back, all edits are lost.
 
 If you’re editing a photo in RAW format (explained in detail in Chapter 9), 
the command path is Photos➪Reprocess RAW.
 
✓ Unlike some photo-editing software, it makes no difference in what 
order you make your edits.
 
✓ Whenever you make an edit (or series of edits), you can compare the 
result against the original photo by simply pressing the Shift key. This 
really helps when you’ve made several changes and aren’t sure whether 
you’ve made things better or not. (Believe me, this question pops up 
more often than I care to admit.) Just keep pressing and releasing the 
Shift key to compare the changed photo and its original until you make 
the call.
Editing in Full Screen mode
Whenever you’re editing a photograph, always try to have it displayed as 
large as possible on your computer screen. (This is especially true when 
sharpening a photo.) If you don’t do this, you might make editing changes 
that aren’t apparent at the time but will be detrimental when printing at a 
larger size. Full Screen mode also allows you to better compare two similar 
images to see which you prefer to edit.
To edit in Full Screen mode, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the photo you wish to edit.
 
2. Click the Full Screen button (see Figure 7-4) or choose View➪Full 
Screen.
 
3. Edit your photo using the tools on the toolbar at the bottom of the 
iPhoto window, as shown in Figure 7-5.
 
 If the toolbar isn’t showing (you did ask for full-screen viewing of your 
photo, after all), simply move your mouse to the bottom of the screen to 
make it appear. Chapters 8–10 cover editing in detail.

Figure 7-5: The toolbar and its numerous editing tools.

127
 Chapter 7: Exploring the iPhoto Editor
 
 Notice the two choices that appear on the far left of the toolbar. Clicking 
the Info button gives you information about the photo. Clicking the 
Compare button allows you to compare the current image with the next 
one in order in the Event it’s located in: If they’re similar photos, you 
can choose which one to edit.
 
 When in Full-Screen mode, if you move the mouse to the top of the 
screen, you will see a film strip (of sorts) that shows thumbnails of all 
the photos in the current Event.
 
4. To exit from Full Screen mode, click the X button on the far-right of 
the toolbar or press the Escape (Esc) key on your keyboard.
Zooming in and out
When viewing your photo in Edit mode, you can zoom in or out on a photo. 
I always recommend that when you’re cropping, retouching, working on red 
eye, and sharpening, zoom in and enlarge the area in question before per-
forming the edits. Here’s how you zoom in and out:
 
1. Select the photo you want to edit and then click the Edit button.
 
2. Do one of the following:
 
• Use the size adjust slider to zoom in and out. Drag the size slider in 
the lower-right corner (see Figure 7-6) and use the scroll bars to 
bring the correct part of the photo into view. You can also click the 
icons at either end of the slider to go to the extremes immediately.
 
• Use the keyboard to zoom in and out. Using your keyboard, press 
Option+1 to zoom to 100% or press Option+2 to go to 200%. You can 
also place your mouse pointer over the portion of the photo where 
you want to center the zoom and then press the 1 key for 100% or 
the 2 key for 200%. Press Option+0 (the zero key) to zoom out.

Changing the Composition After Taking the Photo
The thing about composition is that it’s critical to getting a really good pho-
tograph. However, most people don’t consciously think about it — or, if they 
do, they forget about it in the heat of the photograph-taking moment.

128
Part III: Making Your Photos Look Even Better 
Poor composition is often caused by including too much in the photo, pre-
venting the viewer from focusing on the main feature and causing distrac-
tions. Another cause is having something bright and distracting in the photo 
that pulls your eyes away from the main subject. Cure these two problems, 
and the improvement to your photos is huge.
Luckily, you have the technology to fix some composition errors after the 
fact. Two of the best iPhoto tools to correct these kinds of problems are the 
Cropping tool and the Adjust tool.
Because this is a book about iPhoto, I don’t have room for a lengthy discus-
sion of the theory and practice of compositional techniques. However, I will 
mention three techniques that can dramatically improve the results of your 
picture-taking and lessen the need for extensive editing.
 
✓ The Rule of Thirds is easy to comprehend and to use. Simply imagine 
that the scene you are going to photograph is divided into thirds, both 
vertically and horizontally. The rule, simply stated, is that you typically 
want to place the focus or main subject of the photo at or near one 
of the intersections of the vertical and horizontal lines (called power 
points). The horizon would be placed on or near one of the horizontal 
lines. Placing the main subject directly in the middle is boring and to be 
avoided if at all possible. Figure 7-7 shows what I mean. Here, the bush 
in the middle of the river is very near a power point and gives a pleasing 
composition. Just remember that this is not an exact science. It’s still 
art, so use your judgment.
 
 Using the Crop tool can be very helpful here if the composition isn’t 
quite right.
 
✓ Distracting elements in a photo can be a disaster. Strive to have the 
eyes of the viewer flow naturally to the main subject. If that doesn’t 
happen, maybe you have bright objects that pull the viewer’s eyes away, 
or perhaps a tree limb that inadvertently got in the photo.
 
 Strive to arrange the elements of your photograph to lead the viewer’s 
eye into the photo and to the main subject. Remove distracting elements 
from the photo by using the Crop tool (to crop them out) or the Adjust 
tool (to lessen the effect).
 
✓ Close one eye when first looking at the scene you want to photograph. 
Humans — because we’re binocular — inherently have depth percep-
tion. Often, it’s that depth perception that makes a scene something 
we want to capture in a photo. But a camera only has one eye, its lens. 
Depth can be lost in the photo unless we use some elements (for exam-
ple, trees, rocks, or a hill in the near foreground) to give the illusion of 
depth. If you close one eye, you’ll see the scene as the camera will see 

129
 Chapter 7: Exploring the iPhoto Editor
it — and you’ll also know whether you have to do something to save the 
shot. If your camera has an LCD screen, you can check it to see what the 
camera will see albeit on a small scale.
 
 This is something that no tool can really fix. Make doing this a habit 
before you shoot.
 
 
Figure 7-7: Use the Rule of Thirds.
If the subject of composition really fascinates you, check out Digital 
Photography For Dummies, 6th Edition, by Julie Adair King and Serge 
Timacheff (Wiley). The time taken to get comfortable with this aspect of 
photography is well worth the effort.
Applying Your Changes to Multiple Photos
One of the major advantages of digital photography is that pixels are free! No 
more buying film, having film so old that photos are ruined, or running out 
just when things are going well. Camera memory cards are relatively inexpen-
sive; plus, you can erase photos that are obviously poor while you’re shoot-
ing, thus saving room for more good photos.

130
Part III: Making Your Photos Look Even Better 
My point is that digital photography encourages us to take lots and lots of 
photos. Suppose, though, that in your haste to capture a particular moment, 
you make some consistent errors in your camera settings. Perhaps you take 
25 shots and realize afterward that they’re all underexposed, just by enough 
to be bothersome. That’s a lot of editing to do.
Wouldn’t it be great if you could fix the problem one time and then just let 
it trickle down to all the other photos having a similar problem? You can, 
thanks to iPhoto coming to the rescue.
In Chapter 10, I give you an in-depth discussion of the Adjust tool, but for 
now, allow me to just plant the thought that this tool is the key to easily edit-
ing multiple photos.
Here’s how:
 
1. Select a photo affected by the recurrent problem and then click the 
Edit button to open Edit mode.
 
2. Select the Adjust tool; in the Adjust tool window that opens, use the 
sliders to make your changes.
 
 Note the Copy and Paste buttons in the bottom-right corner of the 
Adjust tool window (see Figure 7-8). This is the good stuff.
 
The Adjust tool window
 
Figure 7-8: Edit mode and the Adjust tool window.

131
 Chapter 7: Exploring the iPhoto Editor
 
3. When you’re satisfied with the edits, simply click the Copy button.
 
 This copies all the changes you made ready for you to Paste. This works 
just like how Copy and Paste do in other Mac applications.
 
4. Still in Edit mode, click the right-arrow button on the far-right of the 
toolbar to bring the next photo into view.
 
 If the Adjust pane is in the way, just click the top bar of the pane and 
drag it to somewhere more convenient on the screen.
 
5. Click the Paste button, and the same changes from Step 3 will be 
applied to this photo.
 
 The Copy and Paste buttons work only with the changes made in the 
Adjust tool window, and not with any of the other tools.
 
6. Continue to click the right-arrow button. As each photo comes into 
Edit mode, click the Paste button to apply the edit.
 
 This technique does require some manual effort, but if the edits are 
extensive, this is still quite a timesaver.

Making Basic Photo Adjustments
In This Chapter
▶ Manipulating the size and shape — rotate, crop, and straighten
▶ Correcting the most common photo faults
A
nsel Adams used to say that if he got 10–12 quality photographs a year, 
it was a good year. Only those shots were worth the time, effort, and 
materials he would expend to deliver a classic photograph. We’re not likely 
to be in his league. So what’s my point?
My point is we can mimic a professional approach to obtain the best photos 
we can. That means
 
✓ Take lots of photos of a subject.
 
✓ Be aware of how each photo looks and try to make each 
one better by altering location, exposure, composi-
tion, and so on.
 
✓ Be critical when reviewing photos — reserve 
the best for advanced editing and the others 
for basic editing to make them the best they 
can be.
I cover advanced editing in detail in Chapters 9 and 
10. But before you do anything advanced, you need 
to understand and practice basic editing, and that’s 
what this chapter is all about.
 
The editing examples are shown within iPhoto’s Edit 
mode. While Edit mode is a perfectly fine way to apply 
edits to a photo, I recommend you do any editing that has 
to be exact in Full Screen view — this makes it much easier. See 
Chapter 7 for more on Full Screen view.

134
Part III: Making Your Photos Look Even Better 
 
When you use any of the tools described in this chapter (Crop, Rotate, 
Straighten, Enhance, Red-Eye, or Retouch) to edit a photo, the result of using 
that tool is applied to the photo in the iPhoto Library. This means that what-
ever editing you do to the photo affects that photo anywhere else it appears 
in your Library — every Album, Book, Calendar, Card, and so on. If that isn’t 
your intent, select the photo you want to edit, choose Photos➪Duplicate, and 
use the tool on the duplicate file.
Let’s get started.
Adjusting the Photo’s Size and Shape
In the sections that follow, I discuss some aspects of composition that 
include altering the size and shape of a photo. The iPhoto tools for perform-
ing these alterations are the Rotate, Crop, and Straighten tools.
Rotating
Depending on the orientation of your camera when you take a photo, you 
may need to rotate the photo to have it appear properly in iPhoto. The 
Rotate tool allows you to rotate photos in 90° increments. To use the Rotate 
tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the photo to be rotated and click the Edit button to open it in 
Edit mode.
 
 You can also double-click the photo to open it for editing.
 
2. Click the Rotate button on the toolbar at the bottom of the Edit pane.
 
 Each click of the Rotate button rotates the photo in that direction 90°.
 
 You can choose to rotate in the opposite direction by pressing the 
Option key and then clicking the Rotate button. You’ll see the arrow on 
the Rotate button change direction. 
 
 You can also set the direction of rotation by selecting Photos➪Rotate 
Clockwise or Rotate Counter Clockwise, as shown in Figure 8-1.
 
3. When you’re finished, click the Rotate button again to turn off the 
Rotate tool.
 
4. Click the Done button on the toolbar at the bottom of the Edit pane to 
exit Edit mode.

135
 Chapter 8: Making Basic Photo Adjustments
 
 
Figure 8-1: Using the menu to set the direction of rotation.
Cropping
Cropping is an area in which your choices, intuition, and artistic skills can 
really make a difference. People are sometimes hesitant to cut anything out 
of a photo, but I assure you, doing so often makes a mediocre photo into one 
that’s stunning.
Before you actually begin cropping, I recommend that you spend a few min-
utes just looking at the photograph in question. Ask yourself these questions:
 
✓ What am I trying to say with this photo?
 
✓ What’s the main subject?
 
✓ What distractions do I see in the photo?
Answering these questions helps you create a plan for making the photo the 
best it can be. It’s amazing how many creative errors you may make when 
taking a photo, but you can often correct them afterwards in iPhoto when 
you recognize what you need to do.
The photo I chose for this example (see Figure 8-2) isn’t particularly memo-
rable. In fact, I took it only to document an event. But it’s bad enough, from 
a composition perspective, to provide a great way of showing the editing 
power of iPhoto.
In Figure 8-2, you see the photograph prior to any editing. Before I do any-
thing, though, I answer my three questions. For sake of argument, let’s say 
that what I’m trying to communicate in this photo is the beauty of this golf 
hole and fairway. The main subject is the flag on the green. The distractions 
are numerous, starting with the orange tape in the lower-right corner, the 
extensive foreground, the deck railing, and the tree and white stick on the far 
left. Wow, there’s lots to do! Follow these steps to correct one of your photos 
with similar issues:

136
Part III: Making Your Photos Look Even Better 
 
 
Figure 8-2: Unedited photo in need of cropping.
 
1. Select the photo to be edited and click the Edit button to open it in 
Edit mode.
 
 You can also double-click the photo to open it for editing.
 
2. Click the Crop button on the toolbar at the bottom of the Edit pane.
 
 The first thing to notice is the white rectangle indicating where the crop 
will occur. This is a moveable boundary that you can adjust either man-
ually or by selecting a size from the Constrain pop-up menu, as shown in 
Figure 8-3. In this example, I do the crop manually.
 
3. Move the mouse over one of the white lines you want to adjust until 
the cursor changes to a pair of lines with two arrows; then press and 
hold the mouse down while moving the line where you want it to go.
 
 In Chapter 7, I mention the Rule of Thirds. Notice that when you begin to 
move the white line, a Rule of Thirds grid is superimposed on the photo 
(see Figure 8-4), helping you to crop and place objects accordingly.
 
4. Repeat Step 3 on each of the crop lines you want to move.
 
 You can go back and move lines as often as you want until you’re 
satisfied.
 
5. When you have the lines set, click the Apply button to set the crop.
 
 Figure 8-5 shows the change I made. Not a great photo, but it’s certainly 
a great improvement.

 Press and release the Shift key to alternately look at the original photo 
and the cropped photo. Remember, you can also revert to the original 
photo and start again if you like by choosing Photos➪Revert to Original. 
 
 
Figure 8-5: The cropped photo.
 
6. When finished, click the Crop button again to turn off the Crop tool.
 
7. Click the Done button on the toolbar at the bottom of the Edit pane to 
exit Edit mode.
Cropping is a real art, and it can save a photo with correctable flaws. It’s cer-
tainly better than driving 100 miles to retake the shot!
Straightening
The Straighten tool has a similar effect as the Rotate tool except that it 
rotates the photo in much smaller increments, with a maximum rotation 
capacity of 10°. To use the Straighten tool follow these steps:
 
1. Select the photo to be straightened and click the Edit button to open it 
in Edit mode.
 
 You can also double-click on the photo to open it for editing.

139
 Chapter 8: Making Basic Photo Adjustments
 
2. Click the Straighten button on the toolbar at the bottom of the Edit 
pane.
 
 You’ll notice a slider bar appear along with yellow grid lines to help 
determine the direction and extent of any necessary corrections, as 
shown in Figure 8-6.
 
 
Figure 8-6: Correcting the photo with the Straighten tool.
 
3. Move the indicator on the slider to the left or right.
 
 Moving the indicator to the left tilts the left side down; moving the indi-
cator to the right tilts the right side down. To the right of the slider bar 
is the number of degrees of rotation that is being applied.
 
4. When you have the correction as you want it, click on the Straighten 
button again to turn off the Straighten tool.
 
5. Click the Done button on the toolbar at the bottom of the Edit pane to 
exit Edit mode.
 
As was true with the Rotate tool, whatever straightening you do to the photo 
will affect that photo anywhere else it appears in your Library. Make a dupli-
cate if you do not want this to happen.

140
Part III: Making Your Photos Look Even Better 
Correcting the Usual Suspects
The remainder of what I call the basic photo editing tools in iPhoto are 
Enhance, Red-Eye, and Retouch. With the power of today’s computers and 
careful, patient editing, these tools may be all you need to bring out exactly 
the look you wanted when you captured your photos.
Perhaps the most consistent error that nonprofessional photographers 
make is in exposure, and the tendency is to err on the side of under-exposing, 
making photos too dark. This is because lighting is a tricky thing and not 
really controllable outdoors. Concentrating on the main subject of your 
photo may cause you to miss the very bright light reflecting off of something 
at the side. That bright spot can end up fooling the camera’s light sensor, 
causing the photo to be under-exposed.
A problem with flash-lit portraits is red-eye, where the subject’s pupils are 
dilated and the flash bounces off the rear of the eye and back out into the 
camera lens.
Requiring constant vigilance, dust on the lens can cause bothersome spots 
on the photo, which distract and detract from the beauty of the photo.
In the sections that follow, I show you what iPhoto can do to correct all these 
problems.
Lightening and darkening a photo
There are always times when, for one reason or another, you underestimate 
the amount of exposure needed for a particular photo. With digital cameras, 
the cure is pretty easy; just look at the camera’s reviewing screen, spot the 
problem, adjust the exposure, and take another picture. But what if this was 
a one-time event. What if it’s something that you can’t reshoot, and you’re 
stuck with whatever you captured?
Relax. All is not necessarily lost. In this case, the Enhance control in iPhoto 
can automatically vary brightness and contrast. Actually, it can do quite a bit. 
To use the Enhance tool, follow these steps:
 
1. As is usually the case, select the photo to be enhanced and click the 
Edit button to open it in Edit mode. (See Figure 8-7.)
 
 You can also double-click the photo to open it for editing. As you can 
see in the example photo, there isn’t enough exposure to see detail.
 
2. Click the Enhance button on the toolbar at the bottom of the Edit 
pane.

141
 Chapter 8: Making Basic Photo Adjustments
 
 
Figure 8-7: The original photo of a P-51 Mustang.
 
 Couldn’t be simpler. The tool looks at the photo and decides on the 
best change it can make. There are no adjustments for you to do; just 
judge if this change is sufficient and has made the photo look the way 
you intended. If not, you can always choose Edit➪Undo Enhance Photo. 
Figure 8-8 shows the result of the enhancement in this example.
 
3. Click the Done button on the toolbar at the bottom of the Edit pane to 
exit Edit mode.
If the use of the Enhance tool isn’t enough, Chapter 10 covers much more 
advanced ways of correcting exposure.
Removing red-eye
I’m sure you’ve all seen horrible examples of people with devilish red eyes 
caused by taking flash pictures in a dark area. The pupils are naturally 
dilated, and that leads to what we call red-eye. Luckily, iPhoto can cause a 
significant reduction in red-eye with the use of the Red-Eye tool.
 
Note that the Red-Eye tool works only on human eyes. Because of differences  
in the construction of pet eyes, they may look green or yellow rather than 
red. If you have software than has a paintbrush-type tool you may be able to 
change the color to look normal for your pet. The iPhoto Red-Eye tool is for 
humans.

142
Part III: Making Your Photos Look Even Better 
 
 
Figure 8-8: P-51 Mustang after using the Enhance tool.
Some cameras and some flash units automatically compensate to virtually 
eliminate red-eye as the photo is taken.
Here are the steps to take if you’re not so fortunate:
 
1. Select the photo you want to remove red-eye from and click the Edit 
button to open it in Edit mode.
 
 You can also double-click on the photo to open it for editing.
 
2. Zoom in to the area around the eyes using the size adjust slider in the 
lower-right corner of the Edit window.
 
 In order to make the Red-Eye tool work properly, you must zoom in to 
enlarge the eyes in the photo. For more on zooming, see Chapter 7.
 
3. Click the Red-Eye button on the toolbar at the bottom of the Edit pane 
to open the Red-Eye tool, shown in Figure 8-9.
 
 I recommend you click on the Auto button first and let iPhoto try its 
hand at correcting the red-eye. It usually does a miraculous job. No need 
to position the cursor — iPhoto finds the eyes. In fact, Figure 8-10 shows 
the corrected photo using only the Auto button.

143
 Chapter 8: Making Basic Photo Adjustments
 
 
Figure 8-9: The  Red-Eye tool.
 
 If clicking the Auto button doesn’t work, use the Size slider to adjust the 
cross-hair cursor to the size of the eyes you’re trying to correct. A handy 
shortcut for sizing the cursor is to press the Left- and Right-Bracket keys 
(they’re next to the “P” key) to decrease or increase the cursor size, 
respectively.
 
4. Position the suitably-sized pointer over one of the pupils to be cor-
rected, click the mouse, and then do the same for the other eye.
 
5. Repeat Step 4 for any other subjects in the photo with red-eye.
 
 As always, you can press the Shift key to see the original photo for 
comparison.
 
6. When you’re finished, click the Close button (the “X”) at the left of the 
Red-Eye control to turn it off.
 
7. Click the Done button on the toolbar at the bottom of the Edit pane to 
exit Edit mode.
 
 This should make whoever was the subject of your photo happy again.

Making spots vanish
Dust is definitely the scourge of all photographers. It’s also plentiful. Make 
it a habit to use a brush specifically made for camera lens to clean the lens 
you’re using before shooting your pictures and always put the lens cap back 
on the lens when you’re not shooting. This also helps keep your lens from 
getting scratched.
Be aware that no matter how careful you are, there will be spots in your 
photos, especially in blue skies. Or maybe your subjects may have some 
blemishes they’d like removed (without a visit to the dermatologist).
iPhoto can help. To use the Retouch tool, do the following:
 
1. Select the photo to be edited and click the Edit button to open it in 
Edit mode.
 
 You can also double-click the photo to open it for editing.
 
2. Move the size adjust slider (in the bottom-right corner of the Edit 
pane) to the right to enlarge the area you wish to retouch.

145
 Chapter 8: Making Basic Photo Adjustments
 
3. Click the Retouch button on the toolbar at the bottom of the Edit 
pane.
 
 As shown in Figure 8-11, you can choose the size of the Retouch brush 
by moving the slider. If your guess is off and you need a different-sized 
brush, just come back to the slider and move it to make it larger or 
smaller. Figure 8-11 shows the mark to be removed within the cursor. 
Just like the Red-Eye tool, use the Left- and Right-Bracket keys to change 
the size of the cursor.
 
 
Figure 8-11: The blemish in the photo to be removed.
 
4. Position the mouse over the mark that you want to remove and click. 
If the blemish is large or irregularly shaped, you may find you need to 
click and drag the mouse to remove it.
 
 iPhoto samples what’s around the area to be retouched and changes the 
photo accordingly. It does a remarkably good job. Press the Shift key 
to view the original and compare the difference. Figure 8-12 shows the 
result — the mark is gone!

146

Figure 8-12: The blemish is removed.
 
5. When you’re finished, click the Close button (the “X”) at the left of the 
Retouch control to turn it off. 
 
6. Click the Done button on the toolbar at the bottom of the Edit pane 
to exit Edit mode. If you make a mistake in clicking with the tool, you 
can choose Undo Retouch and try again.
 
 Of course, you can always revert to the original photo if you’re not 
pleased with the results. Choose Photos➪Revert to Original.
That’s it for basic editing. In the next chapter I start to show you the 
many advanced techniques in iPhoto to make you photo editing even more 
enjoyable.

bring out the best in your photos.
A histogram is a great tool that doesn’t just tell you what’s 
wrong with a photo — it shows you. A histogram also 
makes clear what the application of any corrections 
will do to your photograph. This is key to taking 
advantage of the power of iPhoto’s advanced editing 
capabilities.
In this chapter, I introduce you to histograms and 
how to understand what they mean for your pho-
tographs, current and future. Learning to interpret 
histograms helps you correct current photo prob-
lems, such as exposure and lighting, and avoid the 
same photographic problem areas in the future.
 
Any descriptions of the interplay of light, sensors, and 
electronics can easily become unnecessarily complex, so I’m 
going to try and avoid doing that. This means that although the 
descriptions I give are correct, they might not be complete. For your 
purposes, though, they’ll be enough.

Part III: Making Your Photos Look Even Better 
Defining a Histogram
Regardless of the photo format you choose for your camera’s output (if you’d 
like to know more about photo formats, see the “Formats and visual quality” 
sidebar later in this chapter), the iPhoto histogram (available in the Adjust 
tool) is an aid that you’ll find indispensable. Say what?
Basically, a histogram is a graphical way of showing you, the photographer, 
how the light levels in a photograph are distributed between the shadows 
and the highlights.
 
An important fact to remember when taking photos is that your camera’s 
sensor records light (as photons) in a linear fashion. If the light reaching the 
sensor from one area of the photo is twice as bright as another area, the sensor 
records it as twice as bright (twice as many photons). Our eyes, on the other 
hand, are non-linear. Look at a scene that is twice as bright as another: We know 
that it’s brighter, but we don’t see it as twice as bright. Just be aware that what 
you sense in a scene, using your eyes, might not be what the camera records. 
The amount of light is a measure of how many photons were  recorded.
If your camera has a histogram, use it to help you in judging exposure — it’s 
always better to get this kind of information when you’re taking the photo. If 
no histogram is available, learn from experience how to compensate for the 
difference between sensors and your eyes by studying the histogram in the 
iPhoto Adjust tool. If your camera includes presets for common lighting con-
ditions (indoor, snow, portrait, and so on) take advantage of those.
 
Your digital camera devotes a large number of levels to the highlight area 
(where our eyes are not very sensitive to differences) and a much smaller 
number of levels to the shadow areas (where our eyes are much more sensi-
tive). Each level represents a distinct number of photons recorded, and the 
higher the number of photons, the brighter the light. Keep this in mind as I 
discuss the histogram and the Adjust tool.
 
If your photograph requires using the Adjust tool, I recommend the following 
plan of action:
 
1. Use, if necessary, the Rotate, Crop, Straighten, and Red-Eye tools first, as 
I describe in Chapter 8.
 
2. Do not use the Enhance tool.
 
 Using the Enhance tool makes many of the same changes you can make 
with the Adjust tool, but you won’t have any control of them — if you 
recall, the Enhance tool simply takes a click of the mouse, and it’s done 
(see Chapter 8).
 
3. Use the Adjust tool to make advanced edits to the photo.
 
4. Use the Retouch tool last.

 Chapter 9: Using the Histogram for Advanced Editing
Interpreting a Histogram
Experience is the best educator. That said, the best way to look at how to 
read a histogram is by jumping right in and getting your hands dirty. Roll up 
your sleeves because here we go.
Figure 9-1 shows the Adjust tool with the histogram of a particular photo at 
the top.
 
The histogram for a photo
 
Figure 9-1: The histogram on the Adjust tool.
There are several things in this figure to make note of:
 
✓ The histogram shows the light levels (number of photons) along the 
horizontal axis for each of the three color channels in the camera: red, 
blue, and green. This means the most intense light in the photo — the 
highlights — is depicted on the right of the histogram, with the mid-tones 
in the center and the shadows on the left. The color channel information 
helps make it possible for the camera to create a color photo from the 
black-and-white sensor data.
 
 You can see that there’s quite a bit of blue in the shadows (you know 
that because of the height of the blue curve on the left of the histogram), 
mostly red and green in the mid-tones, and mostly blue in the highlight 

150
Part III: Making Your Photos Look Even Better 
area. This makes sense given the actual photo (see Figure 9-2) this histo-
gram represents.
 
Figure 9-2: The photo represented by the histogram.
 
 The histogram doesn’t tell you whether the photo is boring or not (I think 
it is), but rather that it’s fairly well exposed because the light levels are 
nicely distributed across the histogram. On the other hand, just looking at 
the photo, with its familiar shapes and colors, can distract us from analyz-
ing it properly. You figuratively “can’t see the light for the trees!” And if 
there’s one thing that’s true about photography, it’s all about the light.
 
✓ The relative number of pixels in the photo at each light level is shown 
by the height of the curve vertically. The more vertical the curve, the 
more pixels there are in the photo at that light intensity. When you com-
pare the histogram in Figure 9-1 with the photo in Figure 9-2, you can see 
just how much useful information a histogram provides. It shows a lot of 
pixels in the shadow area, indicating a fair amount of detail there. It also 
shows plenty of pixels in the mid-tones and a highlight area that isn’t 
overexposed. If you look at the histogram in Figure 9-3, you see a very 
uneven distribution of pixels.
 
 It’s obvious that almost all the pixels in the photo represented by the 
histogram in Figure 9-3 are in the shadow area, meaning that the photo 
will be dark and also that there’ll be very little, if any, detail in the mid-
tones and highlights.

151
 Chapter 9: Using the Histogram for Advanced Editing
 
 
Figure 9-3: A histogram for an underexposed photograph.
 
 You’re probably wondering that with the Adjust tool at your disposal, 
why not just use that to fix exposure problems? And you’re right, as 
long as you keep in mind what “fix” means. Think of it this way. The 
histogram in Figure 9-3 represents all the light that was captured when 
the photo was taken. When you use the Adjust tool’s Exposure control 
slider, the light in the shadow area is “stretched” toward the mid-tones 
and highlights. The total number of pixels in the photo stays the same, 
but some of them have moved into the mid-tone levels. If you look at the 
histogram in Figure 9-4, you will see that the height of the curves on the 
left are now lower, meaning that not as many pixels are located in the 
shadows.
 
 The danger is that if you move too many pixels, you introduce noise, 
which is a distortion in your image. In some ways it’s similar to film 
grain. Electronic noise shows up as extraneous pixels sprinkled through-
out an image. Noise degrades a photo and/or cause gaps in the light 
levels when it’s extreme, thus giving the photo a poster-esque quality. 
So when using any of the Adjust tool’s control sliders, keep your eye on 
the histogram and the photo to see the results.

152
Part III: Making Your Photos Look Even Better 
 
 Yes, there are tools in iPhoto to correct your mistakes, but it’s always 
better to make your photos as good as they can be when you capture 
them.
 
✓ The curve in Figure 9-1 doesn’t quite go all the way to the right or left. 
It comes pretty close, but heck! You paid for the camera and all the light 
levels it can sense, so why not use them? That statement’s not as flip-
pant as you might think.
Formats and visual quality
Although you don’t have to read this, I hope you do as it’ll provide some useful photographic 
knowledge.
Today’s digital cameras can deliver various photo formats , and many of them allow you to choose 
what format to use. It’s helpful to be aware of the strengths and shortcomings of each of the three 
most widely-used digital formats — RAW, JPEG, and TIFF — so you can choose the one that’s 
right for you. 
This is a “how-to” book, so I won’t bore you with minute detail or history of how these formats came 
to be. There are plenty of places to get that information if you want it. Instead, I’ll show you what 
using any or all of them means to you in the real world, how they can affect the final photo, and 
how to handle them in iPhoto.
Raw. The RAW format provides the basic or raw sensor information from your camera. This infor-
mation is the luminosity that the sensor detected. Color information is included, but the output 
image from the camera is black and white. A RAW converter will use the color information to turn 
the image into a color photo based on software choices you get to make. All digital cameras use 
RAW data internally, but not all cameras output in RAW format for you to work on. If your camera 
does, I recommend choosing RAW as your output format. A drawback can be file size — RAW files 
can be 2 to 4 times larger than a JPEG file, but RAW gives you more flexibility and doesn’t result in 
loss of visual quality as JPEG does. All in all, I think it’s a good trade-off.
JPEG and TIFF. JPEG and TIFF are two other formats used, with JPEG being the most prevalent. 
Both formats require the software in the camera to modify the RAW data using prescribed algo-
rithms and the included color information in order to output a color photograph. What this means 
to you is that whatever changes you make in the iPhoto Editor are in addition to ones the camera 
has already made.
Both JPEG and TIFF formats can save file space by using compression. JPEG is a lossy format, 
meaning that some visual quality is lost in compression and can’t be restored. Each time a JPEG is 
edited and saved more loss is incurred, although to our eyes, the change might be unnoticeable. 
TIFF, comparatively, is a “lossless” format. The compression factor can still be effective in reducing 
file size, but no loss in visual quality is ever incurred.

153
 Chapter 9: Using the Histogram for Advanced Editing
 
 
Figure 9-4: Moving the Exposure control slider for an underexposed photo.
 
 Without going through a long technical discussion, take this as fact: Half 
of the light levels that a digital camera sensor can capture are in the high-
lights! Those levels are there to record as much detail in the highlights 
as possible. So if you’re going to err in taking a photo, err on the side of 
slight overexposure (emphasis on the word slight). When looking at a 
histogram, this means exposing to the right edge or slightly beyond it.
 
 There’s a second reason that exposing properly or even slightly overex-
posing to the right is important. As I mention earlier in the chapter, our 
eyes are much more sensitive in the shadow area than the highlights. 
So if you’re going to use the Adjust tool, it’s a better situation to have to 
move the Exposure control slider to the left and push pixels (and more 
detail) toward the shadows than to move the Exposure control slider to 
the right, which pushes them into the highlights.
 
 Saying this another way, when using a digital camera (unlike a film camera), 
expose for the highlights and develop for the shadows. By develop, I mean 
use iPhoto to finalize your photo.  And, if you remember nothing else from 
reading this chapter, this tip will have made it all worthwhile.
These are three very important observations, and they help to explain why 
a histogram is so important — and how you can use it to your photographic 
advantage.

154
Part III: Making Your Photos Look Even Better 
Formulating Your Advanced-Editing Game Plan
Before you start using the Adjust tool and any of its control sliders, just look 
at the histogram for your photo and “read” what it’s telling you. I walk you 
through using the Adjust tool in detail in the next chapter, but the key to 
properly using it is to observe first and act second. “Okay,” you ask, “what 
should I observe?” Here’s the answer:
 
✓ Look at the photo in Edit mode. Is the photo pleasing to your eye? Is it 
too dark or washed out? Can you see detail in the shadows and in the 
highlights? Did it turn out how you thought it would when you captured 
it? In other words, get a sense, visually, of what you want to do to the 
photo (important for the present) as well as what you wish you had 
done (important for capturing future photos).
 
✓ Look at the histogram in the Adjust tool window. The histogram should 
confirm your own feelings about the photo. Ask yourself these ques-
tions. Do the curves go past the edge in either the shadows (on the left) 
or highlights (on the right)? Do the curves take up the entire histogram 
or only a part of it? Are the peaks of the curves very short or near the 
top (which tells you something about how well the scene was lit)? Are 
there pixels recorded at every light level across the histogram, or are 
there long stretches were there are no pixels?
 
As I mention before, if a photograph is really poorly captured, there might be 
nothing to do but move on because fixing one thing will make something else 
worse.
Concentrate on the positives, though, and assume that your photo can be 
improved. I’m going to show you the approach I take, and I recommend 
you emulate it until you gain some experience and can make your own 
modifications.
 
The approach I describe below mentions using the controls in the Adjust 
tool window to make advanced edits. Right now, the focus is to give you an 
idea of the approach to take for determining what advanced edits need to be 
made. In Chapter 10, I give you the details for actually using the Adjust tool’s 
controls and making advanced edits.
My approach answers the questions posed above and helps formulate a 
game plan for advanced editing.
 
1. Check whether the curves go past any edge of the histogram, as shown 
in Figure 9-5.
 
 When this occurs, the curve climbs straight up. If you look closely, you 
can see this happened on the right in this case — and, of course, the higher 
the curve climbs vertically, the more pixels it represents. This tells you 
that you attempted to capture a range of light beyond the capability of 

155
 Chapter 9: Using the Histogram for Advanced Editing
the camera’s sensor. All those different light intensity levels (and there 
might be lots of them) have simply been piled up on top of each other 
at the edge, and this is clipping. In this case, I would try adjusting the 
Exposure and Highlight controls in the Adjust window to correct this 
and reclaim some highlight detail.
 
The curve extends past the
edge of the histogram
Figure 9-5: A histogram showing blown highlights.
 
2. Adjust the curves so they take up all the histogram.
 
 This might involve setting the Levels control end points, thus increasing 
exposure and also increasing highlight and shadow detail.
 
3. Although it might be slight, always check for a color cast.
 
 This is called “setting the white point” and makes use of the eye-dropper 
in the Tint control. See Figure 9-6 for an example of a photo with a 
bluish cast.
 
Figure 9-6: Blue cast present in a photo.

156
Part III: Making Your Photos Look Even Better 
 
4. Make necessary adjustments for color saturation and color 
temperature.
 
 These are really personal choices, but I give you some hints for doing 
this in Chapter 10. Over-saturation is evident in a histogram if the tops 
of the curves are flattened against the top of the histogram window. Try 
backing off on the Saturation control in the Adjust window.
 
5. Zoom in on the photo to 100% or higher and apply any needed 
sharpening.
 
 Watch carefully while you apply sharpening to ensure you do only 
what’s necessary.
 
6. Zoom in on the photo to at least 100% and check for color or lumi-
nance noise and correct for it.
As you might have noticed, this order of corrections closely follows the 
layout of controls in the Adjust tool window. Great minds think alike! Actually, 
it’s just a sensible order in which to do things. But be aware, as you gain 
experience there may be photos where it makes sense to do things in a 
slightly different order.
My aim, in the guidance I give you, is to help you use iPhoto to your maxi-
mum advantage. Part of this comes from understanding the process to use 
and the tools that can help. Part of the process is developing good tech-
niques for taking well-exposed photos in the first place. After you master 
that, knowing what to correct is much simpler.

t’s time to put iPhoto into hyper-warp drive, so to 
speak. You’ve taken your photos and used iPho-
to’s basic editing techniques. Maybe, though, there 
are still some corrections to make, and by look-
ing at the Adjust tool’s histogram for a particular 
photo, you see the direction you want to go. (Read 
all about using histograms in Chapter 9.)
 
It’s important to remember that when you use the 
iPhoto Adjust tool, you’re entering the realm of sub-
jective evaluation. There really aren’t any “magic set-
tings” that’ll guarantee a great photo. The real questions 
to ask yourself are whether the settings make the photo look 
like the scene you captured and also whether you like how the 
photo looks. If the answers are yes, those are correct settings for you.

158
Part III: Making Your Photos Look Even Better 
In this chapter, I show you a hands-on approach to correcting flaws in your 
photos to make them the best they can be. Using every aspect of the Adjust 
tool allows you to become proficient in identifying areas to correct and adept 
at making proper adjustments. You’ll find lots of ways to use this tool.
 
If you haven’t already (or you read it a long time ago), now’s a good time to 
read Chapter 9 and get familiar with the iPhoto histogram and see how cru-
cial it is to the proper and full use of the Adjust tool. Understanding where 
and why you use iPhoto’s Advanced tool’s controls is almost as important as 
how to use them.
 
Clicking the Reset button in the Adjust pane takes all settings back to their 
default values; for example, removes any changes you have made to the 
photo.
 
As I mention in earlier chapters of this book, editing a photo in the iPhoto 
Library changes it in every Album, slideshow, book, calendar, or card where 
it appears. This is true for every Adjust tool control and the Effects tool. If 
you want to edit a photo without changing it elsewhere, make a duplicate 
of the photo by choosing Photos➪Duplicate; then, and only then, edit the 
duplicate.
Modifying Light Levels
When you look at a particular photo’s histogram in the Adjust tool window, 
you’ll notice the three indicators on the Levels sliders directly under the 
histogram: one on the left, one in the center, and one on the right, as shown 
in Figure 10-1. These sliders affect the settings for the black point, mid-tones, 
and the white point, respectively.
 
Mid-tones slider
Black point slider
White point slider
 
Figure 10-1: The Levels sliders.

159
 Chapter 10: Finalizing Advanced Editing with the Adjust Tool
Even though these are the first controls in the Adjust tool window, I recom-
mend you apply them, if at all, only after you correct for Exposure, Contrast, 
Highlights, and Shadows because adjusting these controls will cause the his-
togram to move quite a bit. After gaining some experience with iPhoto, you 
might choose to do things in a different order.
Changing the black point
If you refer to Figure 10-1, you’ll notice a gap between the black point (left) 
slider and the beginning of the histogram curves. This means there are very 
few, if any, pixels in the lowest shadow-area light levels — and thus no abso-
lute black. If this is the case, you can do the following:
 
1. In the Edit pane, set the magnification of the photo to at least 100% 
(halfway), using the slider in the lower-right corner.
 
 As is true with many of the slider controls, it’s best to try moving the 
black point slider while watching the photo, with at least 100% magnifica-
tion, to see whether you like it better.
 
2. Move the black point slider (the left slider under the histogram) to 
the right until it just reaches the point where a bump in the histogram 
appears.
 
 This moves the black point to a higher value and means that the pixels 
(if any) lower than the black point slider will be set to 0% luminosity, or 
absolute black. This should enhance the tones in your photo. Don’t move 
the black point slider so far to the right that the shadows lose all their 
detail.
 
3. Now you can press and release the Shift key to compare the current 
settings with the photo as it existed before you opened the Adjust tool.
 
 If you don’t like the new setting, you can always choose Edit➪Undo or 
use Command+Z.
 
4. If you’re satisfied with your changes, click the Done button in the Edit 
pane or continue with other changes, using the Adjust tool.
 
My advice on making these advanced changes is that because some controls 
can affect other controls, you make these changes iteratively. Don’t be afraid 
to go back to something previously set and try changing it a little after you’ve 
used another control to make an edit.

160
Part III: Making Your Photos Look Even Better 
Modifying the white point
In a similar way to modifying the black point, you can modify the white point 
using the slider on the far right of the histogram. In this case, moving the 
slider to the left sets the level for absolute white. Referring to Figure 10-1, you 
see there are very few pixels on the far right of the histogram. By moving the 
white point slider to the left, you’re setting any pixels that exist to the right of 
it to absolute white. Here’s how to do this:
 
1. In the Edit pane, set the magnification of the photo to at least 100% 
(halfway), using the slider in the lower-right corner.
 
 This will assist you in making sure the highlights don’t lose all their 
detail when you make adjustments.
 
2. Move the white point slider (the right slider) under the histogram to 
the left until it just reaches the point where a bump in the histogram 
appears.
 
 This should enhance the tones in your photo and make the overall 
photo brighter. As you move the slider, pay particular attention to the 
detail in the brightest areas of your photo. You don’t want to move the 
slider such that you lose the detail that’s already there. Any pixel values 
above the white point slider are set to 100% luminosity or absolute 
white.
 
3. Now you can press and release the Shift key to compare the current 
settings with the photo as it existed before you opened the Adjust tool.
 
 If you don’t like the new setting, you can always choose Edit➪Undo or 
use Command+Z.
 
4. If you’re satisfied with your changes, click the Done button in the Edit 
pane or continue with other changes, using the Adjust tool.
Let me give you an idea of what I mean by losing detail. Figure 10-2 shows a 
photo of part of the peak of Mt. Washington and the photo’s histogram with 
the white point set to 83%. Pay particular attention to the right half of the 
large snow area.
Now look at Figure 10-3. The white point slider is now set to 97% (much less 
movement), the highlights are still brightened, but there is also more detail in 
the snow area. For me, this is a much better setting. This is the kind of trade 
off you need to be aware of as you make your changes.

Figure 10-3: Smaller white point movement preserves detail.

162
Part III: Making Your Photos Look Even Better 
Setting the mid-tones
After you adjust the light range for the photo using the two sliders on the 
ends (making the light range smaller in this example), you can use the mid-
tone slider to achieve a balance of brightness and shadow detail. To do so, 
follow these steps:
 
1. In the Edit pane, set the magnification at the minimum value that still 
allows you to see the entire photo.
 
 For adjusting mid-tones, it’s best to see all the photo when making 
adjustments.
 
2. Move the mid-tone slider to the left to brighten the photo or to the 
right to darken it.
 
 This adjustment shouldn’t require large changes, so move the slider 
around a little and watch the photo to judge where you want the adjust-
ment to be.
 
 I’ve found it helpful to move the Saturation slider all the way to the left 
to give the appearance of a black-and-white photo. Then adjust the mid-
tones, which are grays. When you’re satisfied, bring the Saturation slider 
back to the middle or its previous setting to restore the color.
 
3. Now you can press and release the Shift key to compare the current 
settings with the original photo.
 
 At this point, you can then make more changes, accept what you’ve 
done, undo your last change, choose Photos➪Revert to Previous (which 
takes the Adjust settings back to what they were when you opened the 
Adjust pane this time), or even click the Reset button in the Adjust tool 
to remove all Adjust settings and try again!
 
4. If you’re satisfied with your changes, click the Done button in the Edit 
pane or continue with other changes, using the Adjust tool.
Fixing a Color Cast
At one time or another, we’ve all been shocked at seeing a photograph that 
has an overall distorting color cast that makes many colors in the photo look 
unreal. It’s not a disgrace if this happens to you, but it’s important you have 
the power to correct it. And in iPhoto, you do. This is the point where you 
should correct this — before making any other corrections.
To fix a color cast, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the photo in the Edit pane or in full-screen view, if you haven’t 
already.
 
2. Click the Adjust tool button.

163
 Chapter 10: Finalizing Advanced Editing with the Adjust Tool
 
3. In the Adjust tool window, click the eye-dropper button just to the left 
of the Tint control, as shown in Figure 10-4.
 
 The mouse pointer will turn into a cross-hair.
 
 
Figure 10-4: The eye-dropper for correcting color cast.
 
4. Pick a white or neutral gray color in the photo and click it. If neither 
white nor neutral gray exist in the photo, try to find a neutral color 
that will work.
 
 Both the Tint and Temperature sliders will adjust automatically, and 
there’ll be no color cast if you chose the neutral color correctly.
 
5. If the photo is still not corrected (it might even look worse), don’t 
panic. Pick another area that you feel is neutral and click it.
 
 The settings will change, as will the look of the photo. Usually, two or 
three choices will be all it takes. Sometimes what looks neutral to our 
eyes has some color in it. You just have to find the part of the photo that 
removes any color casts. It’s often an iterative process.
 
 When you’re satisfied, color balancing is complete. Make sure you don’t 
change the Temperature or Tint sliders after this, or you might have to 
color balance again.
 
6. You can press and release the Shift key to compare the current look 
with the original photo.
 
 If no other adjustments are needed, you’re done.
 
7. If you’re satisfied with your changes, click the Done button in the Edit 
pane or continue with other changes, using the Adjust tool.
Adjusting Exposure, Contrast, and Definition
Digital cameras these days are wonderful gadgets; even the least-expensive 
have electronics that allow them to make exposure adjustments automati-
cally for you. They tend to do an incredible job of making compromises so 
your photo is at least viewable, even though you might be capturing a scene 
in the worst of photographic circumstances. These compromises, however, 
are made in a split second. You, on the other hand, have an opportunity to 
take your time, use your eyes, and make the changes in editing you wish 

164
Part III: Making Your Photos Look Even Better 
you’d made when capturing the shot. Sound great? See how this works by 
getting acquainted with the controls you’ll be using:
 
✓ Exposure: The Exposure control, as the name suggests, allows you 
modify the exposure (overall lightness or darkness of the photo) almost 
as though you had changed the shutter speed and/or aperture when 
the photo was taken. You can think of it as going back in time without 
having to build a special way-back machine or going through worm-
holes. I promise you won’t feel a thing except pride and satisfaction at 
what you’ve accomplished!
 
✓ Contrast: The Contrast control changes the difference between the light 
and dark areas of your photo. It affects contrast on all areas of your 
photo equally.
 
✓ Definition: The Definition control adjusts local contrast, which can help 
you improve clarity and also reduce haze in your photos.
The Exposure, Contrast, and Definition sliders are initially set to 0, 0, and 50, 
respectively, for no effect on the photo, as shown in Figure 10-5.
 
 
Figure 10-5: Exposure, Contrast, and Definition sliders set to no effect by default.
The Exposure slider provides very critical adjustments, and you can even 
recover some of the highlights that have been overexposed by using negative 
values. Remember that half the data values captured by the camera sensor 
are in the highlight area, so it’s important to use as much of that data as pos-
sible. (See Chapter 9 for a more complete description of why this is true.)
To recover some highlights and save an otherwise overexposed photo, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Open the photo in the Edit pane and do a color balance.
 
2. Click the Adjust tool button.
 
3. Use the Adjust tool window and perform a color balance. (See the pre-
vious section for more details.)

 Chapter 10: Finalizing Advanced Editing with the Adjust Tool
 
 Figure 10-6 is an example of the overexposed photo I’m using to show 
you this process. I already applied a color balance to the photo, but 
there are light levels off the right side of its histogram (indicated in the 
photo by all the bright areas that have little or no detail).
 
 
Figure 10-6: An overexposed photo.
 
4. Move the Exposure slider and watch the histogram to see what 
happens.
 
 It’s best to move the slider with the mouse to get an idea of the direction 
and amount required. In this example, –0.98 seems to be about right and 
restores some cloud highlight detail.
 
5. Move the Contrast slider to further enhance the photo.
 
 I recommend moving the Contrast slider while watching the photo to 
see what changes to make. For this example, I used a value of +8.
 
6. Drag the Definition slider until your photo looks how you want.
 
 Try going back and reducing Contrast after you adjust Definition. Iterate, 
if necessary, between Exposure and Contrast. Always work the con-
trols until you achieve the look you want. Use the Shift key to compare 
the original with the current look. In this example, the photo is much 
improved already. Figure 10-7 shows the effect of all three changes.

166
Part III: Making Your Photos Look Even Better 
 
 
Figure 10-7: After making Exposure, Contrast, and Definition changes.
 
7. If you’re satisfied with your changes, click the Done button in the Edit 
pane or continue with other changes, using the Adjust tool.
 
In Chapter 9, I mention that modifying an overexposed photo is usually pref-
erable to modifying an underexposed one. With the latter, you’re trying to 
stretch the small amount of data in the shadows into the upper mid-tones 
and highlights, and this can lead to shadow noise and a generally ugly look 
to the photo. When take your photos in the future, keep in mind the limits to 
exposure adjustment after the capture.
Balancing Highlights and Shadows
You might have already made changes in the light levels and the overall 
exposure of the photo. (If not, I recommend doing so before reading this 
section.) Now your changes will concentrate only on the highlights and shad-
ows. For these changes, you use (you guessed it) the Highlights and Shadows 
controls. With these two controls, you can work directly on the highlights 
and shadows to improve the highlight and shadow detail in your photo.
 
From this point on, you need to really look at your photo and decide whether 
altering more Adjust tool controls is warranted. You can get to a point where 
you’re doing more harm than good. If you decide to make more adjustments, 
making them with the photo at a minimum of 100% magnification is crucial. 
This allows you to see exactly what each change is doing.

167
 Chapter 10: Finalizing Advanced Editing with the Adjust Tool
To modify the highlights and shadows, you can do the following:
 
1. In the Edit pane, set the magnification of the photo to at least 100% 
using the slider in the lower-right corner.
 
2. Use the small Navigation window to position the photo so you can 
observe an area of highlights.
 
 Figure 10-8 shows the area of the Adjust tool window you’ll be using.
 
 
Figure 10-8: The Highlight and Shadow controls.
 
3. I recommend you begin by moving the Highlight slider with the 
mouse while watching the photo for changes.
 
 This allows you to get a feeling for the amount of highlight darkening 
you want to apply.
 
4. When you’re satisfied with the setting in the area you’re observing, 
move to another highlight area and see how that looks.
 
 Don’t be afraid to make changes in the amount of highlight darkening in 
this new area to make sure that whatever value you apply is best for the 
entire photo, not just part of it.
 
5. Zoom out to the minimum magnification that allows you to see how 
the entire photo looks with the change you made. Then go back to 
100% magnification and recheck each highlight area.
 
 Don’t forget you can press on the Shift key to see a comparison of the 
current version of the photo and the original.
 
6. Now you can lighten the shadow areas, if necessary.
 
 Again, zoom in to 100% magnification , use the small Navigation window, 
and concentrate on a shadow area that seems too dark.
 
7. Use the same technique of moving the Shadows slider with the mouse 
to get an idea of how much shadow lightening you want to apply.
 
 The idea is to try and provide some detail in the shadows, enough so the 
eye can recognize there’s something there and not just a black smudge.
 
8. Make use of the Shift key to see the difference between the current 
photo and your original.
 
9. If you’re satisfied with your changes, click the Done button in the Edit 
pane or continue with other changes, using the Adjust tool.
 
 Figure 10-9 shows how the example photo looks after these changes. 
More detail is evident in the highlights as well as the shadows.

168
Part III: Making Your Photos Look Even Better 
 
 
Figure 10-9: After making Highlights and Shadows changes.
 
This would be a good time to make changes to the light Levels sliders if you 
wish. Use the instructions in the “Modifying Light Levels” section, earlier in 
this chapter.
Modifying Saturation Levels 
to Enrich Your Colors
No matter how “artsy” the results are described to be, I’m not a fan of 
cranking up any software editing tools to the point that the colors in a 
photo scream “unrealistic” to the viewer. On the other hand, as I mention 
in Chapter 9, what we see and feel and what the camera records might not 
be the same. I do believe, as do most professional photographers, that the 
final photo should represent what the photographer saw at the moment of 
capture and that corrections made to the digital image are appropriate and 
recommended based on the histogram.
Three controls can dramatically affect colors — Saturation, Temperature, 
and Tint, as shown in Figure 10-10.
If you’ve already done a color balance on a photo (see the “Fixing a Color 
Cast” section, earlier in this chapter), the Temperature and Tint were 
automatically adjusted. The Temperature, expressed in degrees Kelvin, is 
a measure of the color temperature of the light in the photo. Moving the 
Temperature slider to the left introduces more blue (colder), and moving it 

169
 Chapter 10: Finalizing Advanced Editing with the Adjust Tool
to the right introduces more yellow (warmer). The Tint is just a value with no 
units. Moving the Tint slider increases or decreases the red/green tint of the 
photo. 
 
These controls dramatically
affect colors
 
Figure 10-10: The Saturation, Temperature, and Tint controls.
 
Unless you want to undo the color balance or make very small adjustments 
to it, don’t adjust the Temperature and Tint controls. Doing so can introduce a 
color cast!
I’ll concentrate on the use of the Saturation control, which will be the only 
one you’ll use most of the time. Here’s what it can do.
 
1. Select your photo and click the Edit button in iPhoto.
 
 iPhoto displays the photo in the Edit pane.
 
 It’s best to use the other tools already discussed in this chapter first. 
If you haven’t already used them, do so now. That would be the light 
Levels control; Tint’s eye-dropper for color balance; and the Exposure, 
Contrast, Definition, Highlights, and Shadows controls.
 
2. Click the Adjust button to open the Adjust tool window.
 
3. In the Saturation section of the Adjust tool, select the Avoid Saturating 
the Skin Tones check box if there are skin tones in the photograph.
 
 This allows you to increase saturation without destroying the subtle 
facial and body tones.
 
4. In the Edit pane, set the magnification at the minimum value that 
allows you to see the entire photo. Then, with the mouse, move the 
Saturation slider to the right to increase color saturation or to the left 
to decrease it.

170
Part III: Making Your Photos Look Even Better 
 
 You’ll notice in the histogram that this slider mostly affects the 
mid-tones.
 
5. Watch your photo to see the changes that occur.
 
 Keep in mind what you saw when you captured the photo so you can 
make your adjustments to re-create that look for the viewer. Typically, 
your settings will be between 40 and 65.
 
6. Press and release the Shift key to compare the current photo with the 
original.
 
 Happy with the result? Then you’re done. Otherwise, continue with 
adjusting the saturation.
 
7. If there are no other changes, click the Done button in the Edit pane.
At this point, you’ve corrected both the luminosity and color in your 
photo. What remains are two tasks that can put the finishing touches on 
your masterpiece.
Sharpening Adjustments to 
Make Your Photos Sparkle
Any type of pixel editing, especially when it involves post-capture exposure 
adjustments, can cause an overall softening of the image. iPhoto provides the 
Sharpness tool for handling this situation. Figure 10-11 shows the Sharpness 
(and De-noise, covered in the next section) control in the Adjust tool window.
 
 
Figure 10-11: The Sharpness and De-Noise controls.
Here’s how it works:
 
1. Select your photo and click the Edit button in iPhoto.
 
 iPhoto displays the photo in the Edit pane.
 
2. Click the Adjust button to open the Adjust tool window.
 
3. In the Edit pane, set the magnification of the photo to at least 100% 
(halfway) using the slider in the lower-right corner.

171
 Chapter 10: Finalizing Advanced Editing with the Adjust Tool
 
 Sharpness is one tool where magnification is absolutely required. Make 
sure your photo is at least at 100%.
 
4. Pick something in the photo with edges (using the small Navigation 
window to move the photo around), and watch while you vary the 
Sharpness control.
 
 Like other controls, it’s best to watch the photo while you move the 
slider to get a feel for how your photo is responding. As you move the 
slider, look at the edges of the object you zoomed in on. A sign of over-
sharpening is a halo effect along the edges of leaves, mountains, or 
clouds. If you see this, reduce the amount of sharpening. Otherwise, 
the rule here is “sharpen to taste” but use only as much sharpening as 
necessary.
 
 This control is meant to correct for a softening in the look of the photo. 
It can’t correct for a photo that was out of focus at the time of capture.
 
5. Press and release the Shift key to compare the current photo with the 
original.
 
6. If there are no other changes, click the Done button in the Edit pane.
Removing Noise Distortion from Your Photos
Noise is a distortion in your image. In some ways it’s similar to film grain. 
Electronic noise shows up as extraneous pixels sprinkled throughout an 
image. Dealing with noise in the digital age is a fact of life. Eliminating or 
lowering the amount of noise in your photos is another reason for making 
correct exposures at the time of capture. An underexposed photo has more 
noise than one that’s correctly exposed. And when performing exposure cor-
rections in iPhoto, that noise can become more noticeable, especially in the 
shadow areas.
Another fact is that noise is a function of the ISO, or sensitivity setting of your 
camera. This is the digital equivalent of film speed. Keep in mind that setting 
the ISO to high numbers can make a photo possible in very weak light, but 
noise can negate the value of such a photo.
 
All digital photos have noise, but it’s important to understand that noise 
we can see in iPhoto might not be visible when we print. The objective is to 
reduce noise so it isn’t visible or damaging. Because it is very difficult to see 
noise in print, I’m not showing any examples in the following step list.
Color noise, especially in the shadow areas, looks something like confetti, 
with color speckles visible even at 100% magnification. To reduce noise as 
much as possible, do the following:

172
Part III: Making Your Photos Look Even Better 
 
1. Select your photo and click the Edit button in iPhoto.
 
 iPhoto displays the photo in the Edit pane.
 
2. Click the Adjust button to open the Adjust tool window.
 
3. In the Edit pane, set the magnification of the photo to at least 100% 
(halfway) using the slider in the lower-right corner.
 
4. Using the small Navigation window to move the photo, look in the 
shadow areas of your photo for evidence of noise.
 
 If you don’t see noise at this magnification, try a higher magnification. If 
you still see nothing, it’s unlikely any noise will show up in a print, even 
a fairly large one.
 
5. If you do see noise, watch that area of the photo and use the mouse to 
move the De-noise slider (refer to Figure 10-11) to the right.
 
 Don’t overdo it because noise reduction also has a smoothing effect 
on the photo, negating some of the sharpening you might have already 
done.
 
6. Check all areas of the photo to ensure that you eliminated the noise 
problem as much as possible.
 
7. Use the Shift key to check the current photo against the original to 
gauge how much noise reduction you have done.
 
 If you’re finished, click the Done button in the Edit pane.
You’ve used your skills and your creativity to make your photo the best it 
can be. There is one more thing that you can decide to do and that requires 
the use of photographic effects, which is something iPhoto can provide.
Trying Out Effects — Just for the Art of It
The Effects tool is right next to the Adjust tool in the Edit pane. The Effects 
tool window displays nine photos, eight showing each type of effect applied 
and one for the original photo. Figure 10-12 shows the Effects tool window.
 
iPhoto allows you to have multiple photo effects active at the same time. Say, 
if you click B&W and then click Vignette, both B&W and Vignette are applied 
to the photo. Only one from the first row of effects shown in Figure 10-12 can 
be on at any time (B&W, Sepia, Antique). As for the others, the more the mer-
rier! If you want to see what happens with only one effect active after you’ve 
tried several, make sure you click the Original effect to cancel any effect you 
previously turned on before choosing another.

173
 Chapter 10: Finalizing Advanced Editing with the Adjust Tool
 
 
Figure 10-12: The Effects tool window.
The nice thing about the Effects tool window is that you can try each of the 
effects (except the first row), without having to change any other settings. 
Keep reading to see what kinds of things you can do.
 
1. Choose your photo and click the Edit button to open it in Edit mode.
 
2. Click the Effects button.
 
 The Effects tool window opens and shows a thumbnail of your photo 
with each of the eight effects applied so you have an idea of what each 
one does. Figure 10-13 shows the photo I’ve chosen before applying any 
effects.
 
 
Figure 10-13: Photo before using the Effects tool.

174
Part III: Making Your Photos Look Even Better 
 
3. Click the B&W (black and white) effect in the Effects tool window.
 
 Notice that an ON button appears at the bottom of the B&W effect in the 
Effects tool window, and you can click it to remove (turn OFF) the B&W 
effect. Figure 10-14 shows you what this effect looks like when applied 
to the photo. You can also try manipulating the Saturation slider in the 
Adjust tool window to augment this effect.
 
 
Figure 10-14: Result of the B&W effect.
 
4. Click the Original effect, and then click Sepia to turn it on.
 
 Once again, an ON button appears; you can click it remove the Sepia 
effect.
 
5. Click the Original effect; then click Antique to turn it on.
 
 Notice this time that a number appears, with small arrows on either 
side, at the bottom of the Antique effect in the Effects tool window. Click 
the right arrow to increase the power of the effect, and click the left 
arrow to decrease.
 
 You can always press the Shift key to alternate between the current 
photo state and the original.
 
6. Click the Original effect; then click the Fade Color to turn it on.
 
 Once again, a number appears, with small arrows on either side. This 
allows you to increase or decrease the power of the effect.

175
 Chapter 10: Finalizing Advanced Editing with the Adjust Tool
 
7. Click the Original effect; then click the Boost Color effect to turn it on.
 
 You guessed it! Another number appears, with small arrows on either 
side. This allows you to increase or decrease the power of the effect.
 
8. Click the Original effect; then click the Matte effect.
 
 A number appears, with small arrows on either side. This allows you 
to increase or decrease the power of the effect. Figure 10-15 shows the 
result of this effect at the lowest level.
 
 
Figure 10-15: Result of the Matte effect.
 
9. Click the Original effect; then click the Vignette effect to turn it on.
 
 A number appears, with small arrows on either side. This allows you to 
increase or decrease the power of the effect.
 
10. And last, but not least, click the Original effect and then click the 
Edge Blur effect to turn it on.
 
 Again, a number appears with small arrows on either side to change the 
power of the effect.
That takes care of all the single effects . . . but there’s more! You can click 
multiple effects and combine them on a single photo. This obviously takes 
some playing around to get a desired effect, but the ability to do this in 
iPhoto really opens the creative doors. As an example, Figure 10-16 shows 
the same photo with both Sepia and Edge Blur applied.

176

Figure 10-16: Result of using the Sepia and Edge Blur effects.
This completes your tour of the iPhoto Effects tool. Get creative and have fun 
with it.
Saving Your Photo Adjustment Settings
Say you completed corrections for Exposure, Contrast, Highlights, and so on, 
and now you want to take your hard work with the Adjust tool settings and 
apply them to other similar photos. Do you have to go through the process 
all over again with each photo? Luckily, the answer is no.
When you take a series of photos at the same time in the same lighting con-
ditions, they often lend themselves to the same Adjust tool corrections. At 
least, you’ll come close to the right settings and can then just make small 
individual corrections.
Here’s what you do to save your Adjust tool settings and apply them to other 
photos:
 
1. Open the Adjust tool from the Edit pane.
 
2. Make all your corrections to the photo.

177
 Chapter 10: Finalizing Advanced Editing with the Adjust Tool
 
3. Click the Copy button in the Adjust tool window, as shown in 
Figure 10-17.
 
Click the Copy button
 
Figure 10-17: The Copy and Paste buttons.
 
4. Use the arrows next to the Edit pane’s Done button to get to another 
photo. Or, click the Done button and pick another photo to display it 
in the Edit pane.
 
 Figure 10-18 shows the arrows’ location.
 
 
Figure 10-18: Photo selection arrows in the Edit pane.
 
5. When you have the next photo in the Edit pane, apply the previous 
Adjust tool settings by clicking the Adjust tool button and then click-
ing the Paste button.
 
 That’s it! All your corrections will be applied to the new photo. You can 
continue to do this as long as you don’t quit iPhoto or click the Copy 
button again.

Showing and 
Sharing Your 
Photos

G
ot some photos that you had a great time 
capturing in your camera? Want to share 
them with friends and relatives? iPhoto ’09 pro-
vides several options for you to do just that, and 
you ﬁ nd out how in this part.
Chapter 11 shows you how to use good ol’ e-mail 
to share the photos you worked so hard on. For 
something more permanent and as a way to put a 
lot of photos in one place, you can burn them to a 
CD or DVD. For those who have a MobileMe 
account, I show you all the things you can do to 
spread the news, visually, far and wide. This 
includes using Facebook and Flickr, which are 
easy to use with iPhoto ’09.
The iPhone also provides a quick and easy inter-
face to iPhoto, and I show you how to take advan-
tage of that. Chapter 11 covers this as well.
But what if you want to share something that’s 
more permanent? Chapter 12 takes you through 
the capabilities in iPhoto ’09 for printing your 
photos, and Chapter 13 covers making photo 
books, calendars, and cards using photos you’ve 
taken.
I’m as excited as I’m sure you are, so let’s go.

Sharing Your Photos Electronically
In This Chapter
▶ Using Apple Mail with iPhoto
▶ Burning CDs and DVDs for sharing
▶ The power of MobileMe
▶ Interfacing an iPhone and iPhoto
▶ Sharing socially: Facebook and Flickr
▶ Utilizing photo feeds
▶ Exporting to other applications
T
hese days, the fastest way to share your photographic works of art is 
electronically. And because working with iPhoto means that you 
already have your photos in the digital realm, sharing them with 
your friends and relatives is easy. Burning them onto CDs 
and DVDs is quick and easy, too.
Depending upon the resolution of your shared photo, 
the recipient can decide whether to print it. That 
way, you don’t have to worry about shipping hard-
copy photos or risking them getting bent or folded 
(even if you mark them Do Not Bend!)
In this chapter, I show you how iPhoto and Apple 
Mail work together. Don’t want to spend time 
e-mailing photos to each person in your address 
book? No problem — put them on the Web and just 
send an invitation to view. This can be done using 
social networking applications like Facebook and Flickr 
and Apple’s MobileMe service, all of which I show you in this 
chapter.

E-Mailing Photos
Many good e-mail clients are available for Mac besides the Apple client, Mail. 
Eudora, AOL, and Entourage all allow you to send photos. Rather than trying 
to cover them all, though, I concentrate on using iPhoto with Mail. You may 
find software available elsewhere that adds other e-mail clients. Also, later in 
this chapter I show you how to export the photos to a hard drive. From there 
you can attach them to any e-mail client.
Attaching photos to an e-mail is the easiest, quickest, and least-expensive 
way to share your photos. Being easy, though, doesn’t mean there aren’t 
things to think about to make sure the process works. Take these three 
things into consideration when e-mailing photos:
 
✓ Photo file type and size: Remember that you aren’t submitting a photo 
for viewing in an art gallery. To keep the file size down while still main-
taining a decent resolution, go with either JPEG or PNG format.
 
 When you attach a photo to an email, iPhoto automatically converts it to 
a JPEG. If you export photos outside of iPhoto, you have more choices of 
format. PNG is a good alternative.
 
✓ Whether the recipient is using Windows or Mac OS: I find it best to 
make no assumptions about the recipients machine, so I send attach-
ments that either operating system can read. Make this setting in Mail 
from the Edit➪Attachments menu to ensure this; see Figure 11-1. You 
only have to do this one time.
 
✓ Whether you want all photo attachments to appear at the end of 
the e-mail message: This is something else you can set in Mail from 
Edit➪Attachments; see Figure 11-1.
 
 
Figure 11-1: Make attachments Windows-friendly.

183
 Chapter 11: Sharing Your Photos Electronically
Because this is a book about iPhoto, I’ll stick to showing you how to include 
your photos in Apple’s Mail application using iPhoto. Chapter 2 covers the 
General Preference pane where you can choose one of the other e-mail cli-
ents listed, if you prefer.
Sending photos directly from iPhoto
Here’s how to send an e-mail directly from iPhoto. The nice part is you don’t 
have to have Mail or any of the other three email applications open before 
starting these steps. If you haven’t done this already, in Mail, choose Edit➪
Attachments➪Always Send Windows-Friendly Attachments. (See the preced-
ing section.)
With iPhoto open, follow these steps to e-mail a photo directly from iPhoto:
 
1. In iPhoto’s main window, highlight the photo(s) you wish to e-mail and 
then click the Email button on the iPhoto toolbar. (See Figure 11-2.)
 
 
Figure 11-2: Click Email to attach a photo.
 
2. In the dialog that appears (see Figure 11-3), make the following 
selections:
 
• Size: You can choose a Small, Medium, or Large photo or choose to 
send the actual size as it appears in iPhoto. If you make it too large, 
your Internet service provider (ISP) — or your recipient’s ISP — might 
not accept the e-mail. If the photo is only going to be viewed on the 
computer and not printed, the small or medium sizes are usually the 
best. For printing, consider large or actual size to provide the neces-
sary resolution. The photo is converted to a JPEG file for you.
 
• Include: In previous chapters, I tell you how you can assign titles, 
descriptions, and location information to your photos. Here, select 
or deselect the check boxes to indicate your preference on which 
of this information is sent along with the photo.

5. Fill out the e-mail headers (the To and Subject fields) and optional 
message; then click Send.
 
 Your photo(s) is sent on its way.
Using the Mail Photo Browser
Here’s a way to send photos from the iPhoto Library without actually open-
ing iPhoto: You can use the Photo Browser in Apple Mail. This is a very con-
venient way to send photos from iPhoto.

185
 Chapter 11: Sharing Your Photos Electronically
 
1. Open Mail and then choose Window➪Photo Browser.
 
 The Photo Browser window opens, displaying the contents of your 
iPhoto Library. See Figure 11-5.
 
2. In Mail, open a new message by choosing File➪New Message or by 
pressing Ô+N.
 
3. Select the photo(s) you wish to send and drag it from the Photo 
Browser window into the Mail message window.
 
4. At the bottom of the Mail window, set the photo size you wish, fill out 
the headers, add an optional message, and click Send.

Burning Your Photos and Albums to Discs
Although not as fast, creating a CD or DVD with your photos is definitely a 
more secure way of sharing or even backing up your memories.
 
If you use the method that follows to share your photos, the person you’re 
sharing them with must also have iPhoto and should be using the same ver-
sion of iPhoto as you do.
 
However, to share photos with Windows users, export the photo(s) from iPhoto 
to your computer, insert a blank CD or DVD, drag the exported photos onto the 
disc icon, choose File➪Burn Disc on the Finder menu bar, and then click Burn.
To burn a CD or DVD from iPhoto (remember, this disc can only be read in 
iPhoto) do this:
 
1. Open iPhoto and select the individual photos or Albums you want to 
burn to disc.
 
2. On the iPhoto toolbar, choose Share➪Burn, as shown in Figure 11-7.

187
 Chapter 11: Sharing Your Photos Electronically
 
 
Figure 11-7: The Share menu in iPhoto.
 
 A dialog appears (as shown in Figure 11-8), asking you to insert a blank 
disc. XX If you have other CD/DVD applications such as Toast that you 
use for burning CD’s/DVD’s, you may use them instead of the Finder.
 
 
Figure 11-8: iPhoto leads you, step by step.
 
3. Insert a blank CD or DVD and then click OK.
 
 When your Mac recognizes the disc, information about the CD or DVD 
appears above the iPhoto toolbar .
 
4. In the Name field, change the name of the CD or DVD. Then click the 
Burn button to initiate the action. (See Figure 11-9.)
 
 
Figure 11-9: Change the disc name and burn.
 
 Before the burn begins, the Burn Disc dialog appears (as shown in Figure 
11-10) confirming the number of photos to be burned. The dialog also gives 
you the choice to cancel the burn, eject the disc, or proceed with the burn.

6. A burn progress dialog appears (as shown in Figure 11-1), allowing 
you to see the progress of the disc burn. 
 
 You can stop the burn by clicking the Stop button, but the disc might 
not be readable after stopping. This process may take some time.
 
 
Figure 11-11: Burn, baby, burn.
 
 When the burn process finishes, the new disc appears in the Source list, 
under Shares, with the title you gave it.
 
7. To eject the disc, click the up arrow beside the disc name in the Source list.
 
 Figure 11-12 shows the recognized disc in my example.

 Chapter 11: Sharing Your Photos Electronically
Getting on the Web with MobileMe
Perhaps the best way to allow the most people to see your photos is to put 
them on the Web. If you’re fortunate enough to have a MobileMe account, 
you know it’s a great way to keep everything in sync, from e-mail and con-
tacts to calendars.
And with the capability to host your photo Albums in your Gallery, they’re 
accessible anywhere in the world to anyone you authorize — or everyone, if 
you choose. You can even choose to allow others to download your photos 
or upload some of their own (maybe some shots from a party or an event 
that you didn’t capture).
Exhibiting in a Web Gallery
Here’s how to publish your photos or Albums in a MobileMe Gallery from iPhoto:
 
1. Open iPhoto and select the item to publish: an Event, an Album, or 
some photos from your Library.
 
2. From the iPhoto menu, choose Share➪MobileMe Gallery or click the 
MobileMe button on the iPhoto toolbar.
 
 For this example, I chose an Album of World War II airplane photos, as 
shown in Figure 11-13. Any location information set for the photos is 
also present in the Gallery.
 
 
Figure 11-13: Select the photos to publish to MobileMe.

190
Part IV: Showing and Sharing Your Photos 
 
3. Choose the options you desire from the resulting dialog in iPhoto.
 
 Figure 11-14 shows this dialog, where you have the following options:
 
• Make the Album viewable by everyone or by only you; or, set names 
and passwords for individuals to whom you grant viewing rights. 
Making the Album viewable by everyone makes it public — anyone 
who has the Web site address can view it.
 
• Allow downloading of photos or an entire Album.
 
• Allow uploading of photos via a Web browser. Select this if you want 
to allow others to add to the Album. If you do, anyone who can 
view the Web site can upload any photo they wish.
 
• Allow adding of photos by e-mail. By selecting this, you can create 
an e-mail address to which you can send photos from your iPhone, 
some other mobile device, or a computer.
 
• Show photo titles. This will show the titles from iPhoto for each 
photo in the Album.
 
• Show e-mail address for uploading photos. If you allow adding 
photos by e-mail, you can also make the e-mail address for doing 
this visible to all viewers of your Gallery. If you wish to reserve this 
right for yourself, don’t select this option.
 
 
Figure 11-14: Publishing to MobileMe options.
 
4. Click the Show Advanced button to get more options.
 
 As shown in Figure 11-15, you can choose to Hide Album on My Gallery 
Page, which means the Album is viewable at its own Web site address 
but isn’t accessible from your Gallery homepage.

191
 Chapter 11: Sharing Your Photos Electronically
 
 
Figure 11-15: Advanced settings.
 
5. Set the size and quality of any downloaded photos.
 
 This setting affects how long it takes to upload to your Gallery, but it 
also sets the size of photos when anyone downloads them.
 
6. Click the Publish button.
 
 When the publish operation is finished, the window in iPhoto contains 
the Gallery Web site address — and, in my example, the e-mail address 
for uploading photos. Figure 11-16 shows the iPhoto main window after 
the publish.

 Click the Gallery Web site address (at the top of the main window in 
iPhoto) to go to your MobileMe Gallery and see the result of the Publish 
operation, in your browser, as shown in Figure 11-17.
 
Click to announce your Gallery
 
Figure 11-17: Your new MobileMe Gallery.
 
7. Click the Tell a Friend icon (on the top-right side of the Gallery page) 
to send an e-mail to friends and family announcing your Album and 
giving them the Web address. 
 
 Figure 11-18 shows an example.
 
 Great stuff, right? All you need to give folks is the MobileMe Web site address, 
and they can see your photos. And you can update Albums as often as 
you like, doing it all within iPhoto. But that’s not all; keep reading.

 Chapter 11: Sharing Your Photos Electronically
 
 
Figure 11-18: Announce your new Gallery.
Creating a photo Web site with iWeb
If you installed Apple’s iWeb application (another component, along with 
iPhoto, of the iLife suite of applications), you can create either a photo Web 
page or a blog and allow friends and relatives to access your photos that 
way. In the last section of this chapter, you see how you can still make photo 
Web pages even if you don’t have iWeb.
For now, see how easy it is to get your photos onto the Web.
 
1. Open iPhoto and select the item to publish: an Event, an Album, or 
some photos from your Library.
 
2. From the iPhoto menu, choose Share➪Send to iWeb➪Photo Page.
 
 You can also click the arrow on the iWeb button on the toolbar and 
select Photo Page from the drop-down menu.
 
 This exports your photos to a page that’s designed to display images.
 
 Alternatively, you can choose Send to iWeb➪Blog to create a blog page 
using your photos.

194
Part IV: Showing and Sharing Your Photos 
 
 If your copy of iWeb wasn’t already open, iPhoto automatically opens 
it. There are many choices you can make within iWeb to create the 
photo page or blog of your desires. To get detailed information about 
using iWeb, check out Macs All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, by 
Wallace Wang (Wiley Publishing). For now, Figure 11-19 shows an exam-
ple of what a photo page might look like in iWeb.
 
 
Figure 11-19: A typical iWeb photo page, ready for editing.
Now all you have to do is let everyone know the Web address for your photo 
page or blog.
Interfacing with an iPhone
For those of you (like myself) who are fortunate enough to have an iPhone, 
you can import your iPhone camera photos directly into iPhoto. If you have 
iPhoto open, as soon as you connect your iPhone to your Mac, iPhoto rec-
ognizes it and shows it under Devices in the Source list and puts iPhoto into 
Import mode. Figure 11-20 shows an example of this. As you can see, my 
iPhone is named just that: My iPhone.

195
 Chapter 11: Sharing Your Photos Electronically
 
What if you don’t have iPhoto open and you want to make sure it doesn’t 
automatically open when you connect your iPhone? There is a way. An appli-
cation on your Mac, called Image Capture, controls this. Find Image Capture 
on your hard drive and double-click it to launch it. Choose File➪Preferences. 
The first item is for your camera. Change the pop-up menu to say No applica-
tion. Then close the Preference dialog and quit Image Capture. The downside 
of this is that Image Capture will not automatically open when you plug your 
camera into your computer; but neither will iPhoto. And if you open iPhoto 
first and then plug in either your camera or iPhone, iPhoto will recognize 
them and allow imports. So not a bad compromise.
To download the iPhone camera’s photos into iPhoto, here’s all you have 
to do:
 
1. Fill in an Event Name and Description in the iPhoto window. (Refer to 
Figure 11-20.)
 
2. (Optional) Select the two check boxes.
 
 See Chapter 3 for an explanation of these options.
 
iPhone displayed in the Source list
 
Figure 11-20: My iPhone is recognized in iPhoto.

196
Part IV: Showing and Sharing Your Photos 
 
3. Select which photos you want to download and then click the Import 
Selected button; or download them all by clicking Import All.
 
4. When the dialog appears, choose to either Delete Originals from the 
iPhone or retain them.
 
 That’s it! Your personal photos are now securely in the iPhoto Library, 
ready for you to use all your iPhoto skills.
If you took advantage of MobileMe to upload your photos into your Gallery, 
and if you allowed e-mail updating of your Gallery photos (see the “Exhibiting 
in a Web Gallery” section earlier in this chapter for details), you can create 
an e-mail with photos attached, on your iPhone, and see them appear, almost 
magically, in your Gallery.
Using Facebook and Flickr
Facebook and Flickr are two of the most popular social networking Web 
sites today. They’re a great way to share photos of yourself and friends 
with a world-wide audience. A real bonus is that you don’t need to get any 
plug-ins to make the interfaces between iPhoto and Facebook or iPhoto and 
Flickr work because they’re built in. And if you choose to view them (you do 
this by choosing iPhoto View➪Show in Toolbar), Facebook and Flickr but-
tons appear on the iPhoto toolbar. (See Figure 11-21.) For more details on 
Facebook and Flickr rules and operations, see their respective Web sites.
 
The Facebook and Flickr buttons
 
Figure 11-21: Facebook and Flickr on the toolbar.
Working with Facebook
Here’s how to publish photos in Facebook:
 
1. Open iPhoto and select the photos, Events, or Albums you want to 
publish; then click the Facebook button on the toolbar.
 
2. The dialog shown in Figure 11-22 appears and asks if you want to 
enable this copy of iPhoto to publish to Facebook; click Set Up.

197
 Chapter 11: Sharing Your Photos Electronically
 
 
Figure 11-22: Set up iPhoto to publish to Facebook.
 
3. Either log in or sign up for Facebook. (See Figure 11-23).
 
 After you’re logged in for the first time, a dialog appears, requesting you 
to allow iPhoto Uploader to operate.
 
 
Figure 11-23: The Facebook login screen in iPhoto.
 
4. Click the Allow button, and then close the dialog.
 
 The next dialog asks if you want to publish to Facebook and who should 
be allowed to view your photos.

7. (Optional) You can now add photos or Events to the Album by drag-
ging them from your Events or Photos to the Facebook Album in the 
Source list. You can also remove photos from the Album by dragging 
them to the iPhoto Trash.
 
 Any time you make a change to the Facebook Album, click the Publish 
icon to sync with Facebook. The icon is next to the Facebook Album 
name and looks like a radio beam. (Refer to Figure 11-25.)
 
 You can also make changes in Facebook. The next time you sync the 
Facebook Album in iPhoto, any additions appear as Web-sized versions 
in your Facebook Album.
 
 To stop publishing your Album in Facebook, select the Album and press 
Delete.
 
 When you delete the Album, it no longer appears on Facebook or in 
iPhoto, but the photos are still be in your iPhoto Library.
Working with Flickr
Publishing your photos with Flickr works in a similar way to publishing in 
Facebook. Follow these instructions:
 
1. Open iPhoto and select the photos or Events you want to publish; then 
click the Flickr button on the toolbar.

them to the iPhoto Trash.
 
 Like in Facebook, any time you make a change to the Flickr Album, click 
the Publish icon to sync with Flickr. The icon is next to the Flickr Album 
name and looks like a radio beam. (Refer to Figure 11-30.)
 
 You can also make changes in Flickr. The next time you sync the Flickr 
album in iPhoto, any additions appear as Web-sized versions in your 
Flickr Album.
 
8. To stop publishing your Album in Flickr, select the Album and press 
Delete.
 
 The Album no longer appears on Flickr or in iPhoto, but the photos are 
still in your iPhoto Library.
Pretty straightforward stuff but with a lot of power for sharing. And best of 
all, it’s free.
Subscribing to Photo Feeds
Although this section is about showing and sharing your photos, you’re on 
the receiving end. In this case, it isn’t your photos being shared; rather, it’s a 
friend or relative sharing his through a photo feed.

203
 Chapter 11: Sharing Your Photos Electronically
Whether your friends use MobileMe, Facebook, Flickr, or other similar Web 
services to post their photos, iPhoto makes it convenient for you to enjoy 
them — and all within the confines of the iPhoto application. No matter 
where they post their photos, as long as they provide you with the host URL 
address (that thing that starts with “http://”), here’s how to subscribe to a 
photo feed.
 
1. In iPhoto, choose File➪Subscribe to Photo Feed.
 
2. In the dialog box that opens (see Figure 11-32), paste or type the URL 
that was given to you.
 
Click to refresh the subscription
 
Figure 11-32: Subscribe to a photo feed.
 
3. Click the Subscribe button.
 
 iPhoto handles the communication with the site, and you see the 
Subscriptions heading appear in the Source List as well as the name of 
the photo file under it.
 
4. Click the name of the photo file.
 
 The photos appear in the main iPhoto window.
 
5. (Optional) To refresh the subscription, click the circular icon at the 
right of the name. (Refer to Figure 11-32.)
 
 That’s all there is to it.
Exporting to Other Applications
Even with all this capability, sometimes you just want to create something 
else using your photos. The good news is that in iPhoto, you can.

204
Part IV: Showing and Sharing Your Photos 
Using the iPhoto’s standard export capabilities allows you to do things like 
these:
 
✓ Export your photos to your hard drive so that you can burn them to a 
CD or DVD and use them outside of iPhoto. From your hard drive, for 
instance, you can attach the photos to any e-mail client you use, not 
just the ones I mentioned earlier.
 
✓ Create a QuickTime movie of selected photos.
 
✓ Create an MPEG-4 slideshow, complete with music, for a range of 
devices.
 
✓ Save a group of photos as a simple Web page that you can then upload 
to a server for display in a Web browser.
You can also use third-party software (available on the Web; also see Chapter 
14) written especially for the Export dialog to expand the choices you have.
The following sections take a look at the standard choices for exporting from 
iPhoto.
Exporting to your hard drive
Earlier in this chapter, I mention that if you want your photos available to use 
outside of iPhoto, you must export them and use the Finder or other applica-
tion such as Toast to burn a CD or DVD. Here’s how to do the export:
 
1. Open iPhoto and select an Event, Album, or group of photos in iPhoto 
to export.
 
2. From the iPhoto menu, choose File➪Export.
 
 The Export Photos dialog appears.
 
3. Click the File Export button at the top of the Export Photos dialog.
 
 See Figure 11-33 for the location of this button.
 
4. In the File Export portion of the Export Photos dialog, you can choose 
the format of the exported photos.
 
 Your choices, in the Kind field, include JPEG, TIFF, PNG, the Original 
format, or the current photo format. 
 
 The dialog also provides these options:
 
• JPEG Quality: If you’re exporting JPEGs, you can choose the quality.
 
• Include: Select the Title and Keywords check box to include the 
title and keywords you’ve assigned to the photos in the export. 
Select the Location Information check box if you’ve assigned loca-
tion information to the photos and want that information to travel 
with them.

205
 Chapter 11: Sharing Your Photos Electronically
 
• Size: Choose the size of the exported file.
 
• File Name: You can choose what to use as the filename. 
 
 If you choose Sequential, enter the prefix for the sequence in the 
Prefix for Sequential field. For example, say you use Airplanes. 
Then iPhoto assigns sequential filenames, like this: Airplanes1, 
Airplanes2, Airplanes3, and so on.
 
 
Figure 11-33: The File Export portion of the Export Photos dialog.
 
5. Click the Export button.
 
6. When you see a list of locations where the exported photos will be 
stored, make a choice and then click OK.
Saving photos as a simple Web page
Saving a group of photos as a Web page that you can then upload to a server 
is easy to do in iPhoto. If you don’t want to use iWeb, this provides a very 
quick and simple way to provide your photos for viewing in a Web browser. 
Here’s how:
 
1. Open iPhoto and select the photos you want to appear on your Web page.
 
2. Choose File➪Export from the iPhoto menu.
 
3. Click the Web Page button at the top of the Export Photos dialog. (See 
Figure 11-34 for the location of this button.)
 
4. When the Web Page portion of the Export Photos dialog opens, you can 
choose the title, columns and rows, the template to use, the size of the 
thumbnails and images, and whether to include location information.
 
5. After you make your choices, click Export.
 
 A dialog appears, allowing you to choose where to store the Web page.

206
Part IV: Showing and Sharing Your Photos 
 
 
Figure 11-34: Export photos to a Web page.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 To preview your page in a browser before uploading it to a server, go to 
the location you chose in Step 5 and double-click the index.html page.
Saving photos as a QuickTime movie
Another standard way to present your photos is by creating a QuickTime 
movie file. This is a slideshow movie that you can playusing the QuickTime 
Player or any application that supports QuickTime. Here’s how easy it is:
 
1. Open iPhoto and select the photos you want to appear in your 
QuickTime movie.
 
2. Choose File➪Export from the iPhoto menu.
 
3. Click the QuickTime button at the top of the Export Photos dialog. 
(See Figure 11-35.)
 
4. Change the options to suit your purposes:
 
• Images: Set the maximum dimensions for your movie and the dis-
play interval for each photo.
 
• Background: Select the Color radio button and then click the pre-
view swatch to pick your color. To select an image, select the 
Image radio button and then click the Set button.
 
• Music: Choose whether to include the same background music selected 
in the Slideshow Settings window (described in Chapter 13).

207
 Chapter 11: Sharing Your Photos Electronically
 
 
Figure 11-35: Show photos in a QuickTime movie.
 
5. Click the Export button.
 
6. In the dialog that appears, asking where to store the movie, choose a 
location, and then click OK.
To view your movie, use QuickTime Player or any application that supports 
QuickTime.
Saving photos as a slideshow MPEG-4 video
The final, standard way of exporting your photos involves exporting your 
slideshow project as an MPEG-4 movie that you can view on your iPod with 
a color display, an iPhone, Apple TV, or your computer display. To do this 
follow these steps:
 
1. Open iPhoto and select a slideshow from your Source list.
 
2. Choose File➪Export from the iPhoto menu.
 
3. Click the Slideshow button at the top of the Export Photos dialog. (See 
Figure 11-36.)
 
4. Choose a size that corresponds with the intended device.
 
 Notice, in Figure 11-36, the blue dots in the columns for each size that’s 
appropriate for each device. I chose Mobile in my example.
 
5. Choose whether to automatically send the slideshow to iTunes.
 
 If you’re going to sync to an iPhone or an iPod, this is imperative.

208
Part IV: Showing and Sharing Your Photos 
 
 
Figure 11-36: Export a slideshow of photos.
 
6. (Optional) You can specify a number of custom settings (such as video 
and sound settings) by clicking the Custom Export button.
 
7. After you make your choices, click the Export button.
 
 A dialog appears, asking where to store your file. The default is a folder 
named iPhoto Slideshows.
 
8. Choose the location and then click OK.
 
 For syncing your devices, see each manufacturer’s instructions.

Printing Your Photos
In This Chapter
▶ Choosing the correct paper for printing
▶ Trying out different themes, backgrounds, and borders
▶ Printing multiple photos on one sheet of paper
▶ Using the Adjust tool to make changes prior to printing
▶ Using default and customized printer settings
▶ Using iPhoto’s printing service instead of a personal printer
P
hotographers, whether professional or amateur, really seem to enjoy 
capturing important events as photos. Then, when you edit your shots 
to bring out as much quality as possible, you certainly want a print that 
reflects all your hard work. After all, a lot of the fun of photography 
is taking the finished photos and making prints that you can 
hang on the wall, proudly displaying the results.
As you might guess, the print process is what I cover 
in this chapter, along with ways to create elegant 
photo books, calendars, and cards. Generating a hard 
copy can be the most stimulating and rewarding part 
of the whole creative process of photography.
Printing Photos from iPhoto
I have to get this disclaimer out of the way: With the 
large number of printer styles, prices, and manufactur-
ers available, I can’t discuss the ins and outs of every type. 
Yes, printers are critical hardware, but they have so many 
variations. Let me just say that with all the considerations that go 
into making a printer-purchase decision, don’t forget this overriding thought: 
Get the best you can afford. You won’t regret it. In the long run, the cost of 
consumables (paper and ink) is far greater than the hardware cost. If you 

210
Part IV: Showing and Sharing Your Photos 
can, stick with brands that you have experience with and know their reputa-
tion. For me that’s Epson, HP, and Canon. Printing is where you show off your 
creativity, so don’t short-change yourself.
There is no one, absolute, and correct process to follow in choosing and 
printing your photos. Make sure you first consult your printer’s manual so 
you get all the details on how to get the best results with that particular 
model. But here are some useful ideas to keep in mind while you set out to do 
your printing, regardless of which type or brand of printer you’re using.
 
✓ If you have a large number of photos to print, first print a contact 
sheet. Think of this as a sheet of thumbnail (small) images. Making a 
contact sheet allows you to see what the photos look like on the paper 
you’re using. Too, you can mark up each photo with things like crop 
marks, photo adjustment notes — and, in fact, decide whether to even 
print a particular photo.
 
✓ Try different papers, both glossy and matte. It’s amazing what a differ-
ence the paper can make in the final print. You can do this economically 
by printing a few contact sheets with different papers.
 
✓ After printing, let the print dry for a couple of hours, at least. Prints 
tend to darken slightly when they dry, and what looked good at first 
might require more adjustment for the final print.
 
Here’s another thought to keep in mind: In iPhoto, you can select one or 
more photos — or an entire Event — and print using just one execution from 
the Print dialog. Note, though, that when you batch print, the settings in the 
Print dialog apply to each of the selected photos, unless you select a photo, 
hold down the Option key, and then make an individual change of the back-
ground, borders, and layout for that photo.
As you learn the capabilities of iPhoto, sharpen your editing skills, and under-
stand your printer’s capabilities, your printing process will become second 
nature.
Choosing print themes and backgrounds
Start by making theme and background choices.
 
1. Select the Event or photos that you want to print, and then either 
click the Print button on the toolbar or choose File➪Print from the 
iPhoto menu.
 
 Figure 12-1 shows the Print pane that opens. Notice that your default 
printer is selected, but every other printer that Mac OS X recognizes 
as available to your computer or network is listed when you open the 
Printer pop-up menu. Of course, you may choose from this list another 
printer to use. Also, in this window, you can select the paper size and 
print size you want.

211
 Chapter 12: Printing Your Photos
 
Themes
 
Figure 12-1: The Print pane.
 
2. Select the theme listed on the left that will work for you.
 
 Here’s some information to help you select a theme:
 
• Standard: Prints the photo with a white edge around it.
 
• Contact Sheet: Prints all the selected photos in thumbnail size on 
one page.
 
• Simple Border: Prints the photo with a box around the edge.
 
• Simple Mat: Prints the photo with what looks like a traditional 
photo mat around it.
 
• Double Mat: Prints the photo to look like you put a double-mat 
around it.
 
 The preview picture changes to show you what your photo looks like 
with that theme.
 
3. (Optional) To tweak your print, click the Customize button.
 
 Figure 12-2 shows you the Customize pane, from which you can make 
changes with the Themes, Backgrounds, Borders, and Layout buttons. 
You can also access the Adjust tool here to make changes to the photo 
without going to Edit mode. Click the Print Settings button to return to 
the default Print window.
 
 At the top of the window showin in Figure 12-2 is a viewing strip with 
two buttons at the left. The top button will show you all the pages to be 
printed. The bottom button shows all the photos to be printed.

212
Part IV: Showing and Sharing Your Photos 
 
 
Figure 12-2: Customize prints before printing.
 
 For any of the first three themes (refer to Figure 12-1), the choices in the 
other toolbar buttons are minimal, so I’ll concentrate on choices that 
exist for the Double Mat theme.
 
4. Click the Background button on the toolbar and select one of the 26 
choices.
 
 For this running example, I chose number 3. See the results in Figure 12-3.
 
 
Figure 12-3: The background choices and the application of option 3 with Double Mat.

213
 Chapter 12: Printing Your Photos
Picking the border and layout
When you selected a Theme you set the basic look (in this example, Double 
Mat), the next task is to pick a specific border and layout. If you haven’t 
already picked a theme and background, do so. (See the previous section.) 
then follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Borders button on the toolbar to open the Borders menu, 
then choose one of the seven types.
 
 I chose number 6. Figure 12-4 shows what the example looks like so far.
 
2. Click the Layout button on the toolbar to open the Layout menu, and 
then select one of the 24 choices.
 
  I chose entry one, and then the second one in the submenu, and I cre-
ated a line of text for the photo. Figure 12-5 shows the results.
The Layout menu is very comprehensive and even allows you to work with 
multiple photos and arrange them on a single sheet of printer paper. This can 
save you some cash because you can get more than one print from one sheet 
of photo printing paper. Or you just might want to combine photos in differ-
ent panes on the single sheet of paper for artistic reasons.
Resuming the print process
Once you have started to print, a Printing icon 
appears i the Source List. If you’re interrupted 
before you finish printing, iPhoto helps you out. 
Clicking this icon makes it very convenient to 
do other work in iPhoto. Or you can even quit 
iPhoto, start iPhoto again, and then simply click 
the Printing icon to return to where you were in 
the printing sequence.

 Chapter 12: Printing Your Photos
But what if you decide you don’t like the order the photos appear in? Luckily, 
this kind of thing is easy to correct and doesn’t require you to start over. 
Follow these steps if you change your mind:
 
1. Place the mouse over the photo you wish to move.
 
2. Click and drag the photo to the area desired.
 
 The photo you drag and the one you drag it over change places. This 
makes it much easier to try out different arrangements before proceed-
ing with the printing. Figure 12-6 shows this change being made.
 
Here are some other handy things to bear in mind:
 
✓ At any time, you can go back and try different combinations of back-
grounds, borders, and layouts until you’re satisfied.
 
✓ If you choose one of the layouts that has text, use the Settings button 
on the toolbar to change the formatting of the text.
 
✓ When you’re printing just one photo, clicking the Settings button also 
allows you to make Multiples of the Same Photo per Page when you 
choose a layout that allows this.
 
 This helps you make enough copies for friends and relatives and still 
save photo paper.
 
✓ Photos in the viewer that you’ve used in a multiphoto layout sport a 
white check mark.

Making final changes with the Adjust tool
After you settle on all the aesthetic changes to the look of the to-be-printed 
sheet, you have the chance to make final corrections to the photos.
Thanks to the inclusion of the Adjust tool in the Customize pane, you don’t have 
to return to Edit mode to make these corrections. To make photo corrections in 
the Customize pane (see the previous sections to get there), follow these steps:
 
1. Select the photo(s).
 
• If you’re working with only one photo: Select it by clicking it with the 
mouse; then click the Adjust button on the toolbar.
 
• If you have multiple photos (refer to Figure 12-6): Select the photo to 
work on and then click the Adjust button. If you want to make the 
exact same adjustments to all the photos, you can select them all 
(hold down the Shift key and click on each photo) and then click 
the Adjust button. Moving any slider or size control now affects all 
the photos.
 
 Figure 12-7 shows one photo selected and the Adjust tool window open.
 
 
Figure 12-7: Using the Adjust tool before printing.

217
 Chapter 12: Printing Your Photos
 
2. (Optional) Increase or decrease the photo size.
 
 Check out the slider control just above the photo in question. Use this 
slider to increase or decrease the size of the photo within the confines 
of the layout. And by clicking and dragging, you can move the photo 
around. Figure 12-8 shows the result of increasing the size and moving 
the photo.
 
3. When you’re satisfied with the result of your changes, click the Print 
button to proceed with the printing process.
 
 
Figure 12-8: Adjust the size of an individual photo.
Printing Your Photo on Your Home Printer
At this point in the chapter, you’ve made some decisions regarding how you 
want your photo to look in the final print. Don’t forget, however, that you can 
always change these decisions any time before you actually click Print.
 
Unlike other operations in iPhoto, printing changes that you make in the 
Customize pane — including resizing, as described in the preceding section — 
apply only to the print operation. These changes don’t appear in your 
Library, Albums, books, cards, calendars, or slideshows.

218
Part IV: Showing and Sharing Your Photos 
The printer settings that you choose ensure that what you want to see in a 
print is the result that you get from your printer’s hardware and software.
As I mention earlier, each printer is different, and I can’t go into detail on 
each one. Make sure you read your printers manual for guidelines on using 
it. In this section, however, I give you a general idea of the choices you’ll see 
during the print process, and I tell you what each means. Remember, though, 
that, the dialogs shown here will likely be slightly different, depending on 
your particular brand and model of printer.
Choosing printer settings
Up to this point in the chapter, you’ve finished at least the first pass at set-
ting up your photo for printing — and you might have had your printer crank 
out a few test prints. Here’s what comes next: You make the final choices in 
the printing process, choices regarding things like print quality, paper size, 
and color settings. I use an example photo to take you through the steps.
 
1. Click the Print button, located on the bottom-right side of the iPhoto 
main window.
 
 This sends the project to your selected printer and starts entering 
printer-specific information.
 
 You see a Print dialog showing the name of the printer, a thumbnail of 
the photo to be printed, and a pop-up menu in the middle that shows 
the default iPhoto setting.
 
2. Click the pop-up menu and choose Print Settings. (See Figure 12-9.)
 
 In the Print dialog that opens (see Figure 12-10), you can change things 
like the media type, whether you want color or black and white, the 
color space to use, and some print-quality settings that will vary, 
depending on the type of printer you have. Figure 12-10 shows the 
choices for my example and my printer.
Selecting paper type and color settings
Now you choose paper type and make color setting choices.
First, examine the default values and see whether they meet your needs. Back 
in Figure 12-10, you can see the basic default values for my example print 
and my particular printer. If you like these values, just go ahead and click the 
Print button.
In my running example, though, I want to change the Media Type because the 
paper I’m using is different than the default, and I want the Color Settings set 
to use the larger color space called Adobe RGB. This should allow for more 
accurate colors in the print. See Figure 12-11.

Figure 12-10: Change print settings here.

220
Part IV: Showing and Sharing Your Photos 
 
 
Figure 12-11: I changed some default print settings.
Now look at the Print Quality setting. (Refer to Figure 12-10.) Although I chose 
not to do so in my example, you can also change the Print Quality to get the 
resolution you desire, understanding that choosing a higher resolution takes 
longer to print, uses more ink and may not make a noticeable difference.
The Big Moment. Just click the Print button to complete your print project.
Sounds easy enough, but you don’t really know if you’ll like the print until 
you see it.
 
When you view a photo on your computer screen, you’re viewing it with 
transmitted light. Looking at a print means that you’re viewing reflected light 
from paper, which can produce quite a different look. If necessary, go back 
and use the Adjust tool to make corrections or change the type of paper 
you’re using. It can make a lot of difference.

221
 Chapter 12: Printing Your Photos
Using a printing service
If you don’t have a printer that you feel is up to the task of printing your 
photos, another option is available directly from iPhoto: the Kodak Print 
Service. You still make all the photo-editing changes, such as cropping, 
straightening, removing red-eye, and using the Adjust tool to get the photo 
looking how you want. But you don’t have to mess with multiple printer set-
tings to figure out how to get your specific printer model to produce the look 
you want.
To use the Kodak Print Service, do the following:
 
1. In iPhoto, select the photos or Events you want to print.
 
2. From the menu bar, choose File➪Order Prints.
 
 The Order Prints dialog appears, as shown in Figure 12-12. The dialog 
shows thumbnails of all the selected photos.
 
 
Figure 12-12: Order prints from Kodak.

222
Part IV: Showing and Sharing Your Photos 
 
3. For each photo, select the print size and number of copies.
 
 If you’re ordering only 4" x 6" prints, use the Quick Order arrows at the 
top-right side of the dialog to specify the number of sets you want.
 
 For any sizes where the resolution of the photo is such that poor print 
quality will likely result, a yellow alert triangle appears. Select a smaller 
print size.
 
 If you don’t already have an account, you must click the Set Up Account 
button before you can make any other selections.
 
 A series of dialogs take you through all the required financial informa-
tion. You can even choose the shipment method.
 
4. After reviewing your order choices, click the Buy Now button to place 
your order.
 
 To check the status of your order, go to Apple Photo Services Support at 
www.apple.com/support/photoservices.
Now just sit back and wait for your prints to arrive.

T
raditionally, when you want to share your photos, you make some prints 
to show people when you see them, or you e-mail those photos to friends 
and family because that’s quick and easy to do. But what if you really want to 
make a statement with your photos and enhance the entire presen-
tation so that they don’t just get lost in the shuffle or erased 
along with the e-mail that brought them?
In this chapter, I show you four other ways to share 
your photos via iPhoto: photo books, calendars, 
cards, and slideshows. Some of them will require a 
little cash to bring them to fruition, but for the right 
occasion and for the right photos, the results can 
be priceless.
Have a look.
Creating a Photo Book
You have quite a few choices at your disposal when creating 
a photo book. From the overall look and feel, to whether the photo 
pages are printed double- or single-sided, you get to decide on a design that 
works for you.

224
Part IV: Showing and Sharing Your Photos 
In particular, you can decide on the following characteristics — and change 
them at will:
 
✓ Book type and theme
 
✓ Page background and layout — per book or on a page-by-page basis
 
 This includes placing a map showing the photo’s location on the layout.
 
✓ Picture placement on each page, manually or automatically
Because this process is integrated into iPhoto, your book creation experience 
is quick and easy.
Picking a book type and theme
The two really great things about picking the book type and theme are that 
both are easy to do, and you can change your choices right up to the last 
minute. Here’s how it works.
 
1. Select one or more Albums or Events, or a group of photos, for your book.
 
2. Click either the + (Add) icon on the small toolbar and then choose 
Book; or you can click the Book icon on the toolbar or (if the width of 
the iPhoto window is below a certain size, click on the Keepsakes icon 
in the toolbar and then choose Book).
 
 Figure 13-1 shows the dialog that appears, from which you can choose 
the book type and size as well as the book theme. The preview on the 
right side of the dialog shows you what your choices look like.
 
 Check out the various options and prices before you start by clicking 
the Options + Prices button. You do have to be online, first, though.
 
 
Figure 13-1: Start by choosing the book type and theme.

225
 Chapter 13: Showcasing Your Photos
 
3. After you make your choices, click the Choose button.
 
 Notice that some themes allow text to be entered along with the photos.
 
 Figure 13-2 shows the result of choosing a type and theme. A new head-
ing, Keepsakes, appears in the Source list, and the book appears under 
that heading. You can edit the book title at any time. By default, the title 
is the name of the Event being used as content plus the word Book or 
Untitled Book in the event you just chose a group of photos.
Across the top of the Book window, shown in Figure 13-2, is the photo 
browser, which looks like a film strip. In the photo browser, you see the 
photos that will appear in the book, in the order in which they’ll appear. The 
first photo on the left side of the photo browser will appear on the cover. 
Just click and drag the photos to change the order at any time. As each photo 
is used, a check mark appears in its lower-right corner. In the middle pane of 
the Book window, you see the cover of your book and any text allowed. This 
text can be edited at any time. On the toolbar is a row of buttons, where you 
can (from left to right) perform the following actions:

✓ Play selected photos as a slideshow.
 
✓ Change the theme.
 
✓ Modify the page background on individual pages.
 
✓ Change the layout on the various pages.
 
✓ Add pages to the book.
 
✓ Autoflow all your photos into the book automatically.
 
✓ Use an Adjust palette that is a combination of the Effects and Adjust 
palettes in the iPhoto Editor.
 
✓ Crop and move each photo on each page.
 
✓ Modify the formatting for the text on each page.
 
✓ Change the display size of the page using the slider on the bottom-
right side of the window.
Wow, that’s a lot of finessing! Keep reading to see how to use each button.
Changing your book backgrounds and layout
The choices provided by the Background and Layout buttons change, depend-
ing on the Theme you chose. To change the background, follow these steps:
 
1. Use the right- and left-facing arrow buttons (on the far-right side of the 
toolbar) to move to the page you want to change.
 
2. Click the Background button to see what choices you have and then 
choose one, such as white, black, or a photo.
 
 For this example, Figure 13-3 shows the choices for the current page.
 
3. Continue using the right- and left-arrow buttons to change other pages 
as necessary.
The Layout button works in much the same way but with more choices, 
depending on the Theme you’re editing.
 
1. If necessary, use the right- and left-arrow buttons to move to the page 
you wish to edit.
 
2. Click the Layout button to see your choices, and then make one.
 
 In Figure 13-4, you can see the choices for the page I made. Your layout 
choices also include the name of the particular page type, such as an 
About page or a Contact page. You’re free to choose any of them.
 
3. Continue using the right- and left-arrow buttons to change other pages 
as necessary.

Placing your photos
Of course, background and layout are only part of what goes into making a 
great photo book. The main ingredient is your photos — and, equally impor-
tant, the order in which they’re placed on the pages.
To order and place photos manually
 
1. Go to the page where you wish to place your photo(s).
 
2. In the top part of the iPhoto Book window (refer to Figure 13-2) is the 
photo browser, showing all the photos you designated for this book. Click 
and drag the photo you want to the photo location on the opened page.
 
 iPhoto sizes the photo properly for the size of the location.
 
3. Continue with each page until you place all your photos.
To let iPhoto arrange the photos for you
 
1. Make sure to arrange your photos in the photo browser in the order 
you desire.
 
 You can reorder (just click and drag) your photos in the photo browser 
at the top of the iPhoto Book window. This is especially important if you 
have a photo on the front cover because the first photo in line is the one 
that iPhoto will use on the cover.
 
2. Click the Autoflow button on the toolbar.
 
3. Look at each page in your book to make sure that you still like the 
order of the photos.
 
 If not, you can click and drag photos on facing pages to different loca-
tions on those pages.
 
4. (Optional) iPhoto books are a minimum of 10 pages for single-sided pages 
and 20 pages for double-sided pages. If you have too many pages for the 
number of photos, click on the Page View button (which is the top one at 
the left of the photo browser) then click the extra pages, one by one, in 
the photo browser at the top of the window and press the Delete key.

When you click the Adjust button on the toolbar, the Adjust tool window

opens. Right-click or Control-click the photo to bring up a menu that allows 
you to mirror the image (the photo looks like the reflection in a mirror) and 
also go directly to the iPhoto Editor (select Edit Photo) to use all its tools. 
(See Chapter 7 for more details.)
When you finish in the Editor, you return to the page you left in the book. 
You also see a black box at the top of the photo that allows you to resize the 
photo as you wish and move it in the frame.
If you have location information for your photos, you can place a travel map 
on a book page. (See Chapter 3 for more about adding location information to 
photos.) Click the book page; then click the Layout button on the toolbar and 
choose Map. Figure 13-6 shows the menu choice and the result. You can click 
and drag the map to orient it to your choice.
In my running example, there are two locations shown because I took some 
of the photos at a different site. You can always change how many locations 
are shown. Click anywhere on the map, and a small dialog appears, letting 
you change the map size and remove any of the locations you don’t want. See 
Figure 13-7.

If you have more than one location, you can impose lines indicating the direc-
tion of travel on the map. Click the map; in the dialog that appears, select the 
Show Lines check box. If the directional arrow goes in the wrong direction, 
simply drag the location names in the dialog into the proper order, and the 
arrow changes accordingly. Figure 13-8 shows this. To dismiss the dialog, 
click away from the map.

much more. Here’s how:
Click the Settings button on the toolbar to change the various text formats in 
the book. This dialog is shown in Figure 13-9.

Buying your photo book
Not much point in creating a photo book if you can’t hold it in your hands 
and share it, now, is there? Purchasing a book is very simple. Just take a 
minute to preview it for one last perusal, and then buy online!
 
I do want to mention, though, that you need an Apple ID and a valid credit 
card to purchase a photo book.
 
1. When you’re finished creating and editing pages, preview your photo 
book by right-clicking in the gray area around your book and choos-
ing Preview Book.
 
 A PDF file is generated, which opens for your inspection. When you’re 
finished with the preview, just quit the application you’re using to view it.
 
 Alternatively, you can click the Slideshow button on the toolbar and 
watch a slideshow presentation of your book.
 
2. Click the Buy Book button to begin the ordering process.
Nice job!
Creating a Custom Photo Calendar
Something that can display your photos, make a nice gift, and be useful at the 
same time is a photo calendar. And iPhoto offers an easy and convenient way 
to make one. Use preset themes and layouts, modify each calendar page to make 
it just the way you want it, and then let iPhoto place the photos for you — or 
add them yourself manually. Here’s how.
Pick your calendar design
Start by choosing your photos.
 
1. Select the Albums, Events, or photos you want to use in your calendar.
 
2. Click the Calendar button in the toolbar or (if the width of the iPhoto 
window is below a certain size) click on the Keepsakes icon in the 
toolbar and then choose Calendar.
 
3. From the dialog that appears, select the theme you want and then 
click the Choose button.
 
 Figure 13-10 shows some of the selections, which range from Formal to 
Kid’s Cutouts.

• Start month and year for the calendar.
 
• Number of months (up to 24).
 
• Whether you want the national holidays of a particular country to 
appear.
 
• Where to get other information (such as iCal events and birthdays) 
you want placed in the calendar.
 
 
Figure 13-11: Add special dates to your calendar.
 
5. When you’re finished with these choices, click OK.
 
6. Your calendar will appear under Keepsakes in the Source list with 
either the name of the Event used for content plus the word Calendar 

234
Part IV: Showing and Sharing Your Photos 
or the name Untitled Calendar if you used a group of photos for con-
tent. Click twice on the name of the calendar to highlight it, then type 
the name you wish and press Return.
In the photo browser running vertically, you can see all the photos you 
selected for the calendar. Figure 13-12 shows this for my example.
Use the right- and left-arrow buttons on the far-right side of the toolbar to 
scan through the various months to see where and how many photos will be 
placed in each month. You can modify the individual page layouts as follows.

Modifying calendar page layout
After you choose your photos and decide on a theme, you can tinker with the 
design layout by doing the following.
 
1. At the top of the photo browser, click the single-page icon (the one on 
the left) to see the pages of the calendar in the photo browser.

235
 Chapter 13: Showcasing Your Photos
 
2. Pick the month you want to modify, click it in the photo browser, and 
then click the Layout button on the toolbar to choose a new one.
 
 Figure 13-13 shows the choices. Currently, there is room for seven 
photos, but I think that’s too many. I changed it to three.

3. When you’re finished with the layout changes, click the photos icon at 
the top of the photo browser (it’s the one on the right) to again see all 
your photos.
Setting the photos for each month
Now set the photos for each of the months in your calendar. There are two 
ways to do this. Here’s how to do it manually:

236
Part IV: Showing and Sharing Your Photos 
 
1. Use the right- and left-arrow buttons on the toolbar to get to the month 
you wish to modify.
 
2. Drag the photo or photos of choice from the photo browser and drop 
them on the photo placeholders on each month to be edited.
 
 For months with multiple photos, click and drag photos to rearrange 
them at will.
 
 Each photo that you’re using has a white check mark in the lower-right 
corner.
You can also let iPhoto set the photos for you. Just click and drag the thumb-
nails in the photo browser to get them in the order you prefer. iPhoto uses 
them from top to bottom in order. (The top photo is the cover photo.)
To let iPhoto place the photos for you, click the Autoflow button on the tool-
bar. After that, you can still manually click and drag the photos where you 
wish within the month they appear. Figure 13-14 shows the result of this.

 Chapter 13: Showcasing Your Photos
Photos for special calendar dates
Because iPhoto allows you to mark things like birthdays and anniversaries on 
your calendar, you might also want to place a photo on those special occa-
sions. It’s easy to do.
 
1. If the photo you want to use isn’t already in the photo browser simply 
click Photos in the Source list, find the photo you want, and drag it 
onto your calendar listed under Keepsakes.
 
 Your photo now appears at the end of the photo browser.
 
2. Go to the month in which the special occasion occurs. Drag and drop 
the photo from the photo browser onto the day in the calendar.
 
3. Double-click that day to bring up the editing dialog for the photo. (See 
Figure 13-15.)
 
 
Figure 13-15: Edit a photo for a particular date.
 
4. You can adjust the size of the photo with the slider.

5. (Optional) To create a caption
 
a. Select the Caption check box.
 
b. Type the caption in the text box.
 
c. Use the four-point symbol to specify whether the caption will appear 
at the left, right, top, or bottom of the day’s square.
 
6. Click the Close button at the top left of the editing dialog to close it.
That’s all there is to it.
Buying your calendar
After you make all the changes and additions, preview your calendar and 
then buy it.
 
You need an AppleID and a valid credit card to purchase a calendar.
 
1. Right-click or control-click anywhere in the gray area surrounding 
your calendar in the iPhoto window.
 
2. In the pop-up menu that appears, you have two choices: Save Calendar 
as PDF and Preview Calendar. Choose Preview Calendar.
 
3. Your calendar opens in Preview for your inspection. When you’re fin-
ished, simply close the application you used for viewing.
 
4. Click the Buy Calendar button to begin your purchase.
 
 You’re connected to Apple to enter all the details.
Imagine how happy everyone who receives your very personalized calendar 
for the coming year will be when they receive it!
Designing Custom Cards
It seems these days that almost every day on the calendar has an occasion 
set aside for it. I know, that’s stretching things a bit, but we all have special 
days that we celebrate each year. What better way to do so than by sending a 
card, using your own photos. iPhoto makes it easy to do.
Choosing the occasion
Start by choosing the occasion. After all, you don’t want to send a 50th wed-
ding anniversary card sporting a photo of your three-year-old dressed like a 
witch at Halloween? (Well, maybe for a Happy Divorce card.)

1. With the card you chose in the center pane, use these buttons on the 
toolbar:
 
• Background: Choose from a number of colored backgrounds.
 
• Design: Choose from several ways of displaying the photo scene 
(with a border, with a mat, with a title, and so on) and whether to 
have text.
 
 You can also choose to change the card’s orientation; set it to horizontal 
or vertical.
 
2. Click the photo and then click the Adjust button on the toolbar to 
modify your photo. Figure 13-17 shows the usual sliders in the Adjust 
tool window and a slider for changing the photo size above the photo.

2. Make your selections.
 
 You can choose the font and size for the headline, title, and body text. You 
can even have the Apple logo printed on the back of the card, if you wish.
 
3. Click OK.
Buying your cards
After you made all your changes, take a preview look at your card and then 
buy it. If you have some card stock that you want to use for printing your 
card you can certainly do that. Use the PDF file described below and the tech-
niques in Chapter 12 for printing at home.
 
As with photo books and calendars, you need an AppleID and a valid credit 
card to purchase a card.
 
1. Right-click or Control-click anywhere in the gray area surrounding 
your card in the iPhoto window.
 
2. In the pop-up menu that appears, you see two choices: Save Card as 
PDF and Preview Card. Choose Preview Card. If you’re going to print 
this yourself, you would Save Card as PDF.
 
3. Your card opens for your inspection. When you’re finished, simply 
close the application used for viewing.
 
4. Click the Buy Card button to begin your purchase.
 
 You’re connected to Apple to enter all the details.

Creating a Slideshow
Ever watched a program on TV that used photographs to tell a story and won-
dered whether you could do that with your own story? Of course, you can — 
with iPhoto, which makes it pretty easy to do. You can even add effects, tran-
sitions, and your favorite music just like the pros. When you’re finished, you can 
run the slideshow on your computer or export it to your hard drive or iDVD to 
share with others or post it to your MobileMe Gallery or a Web page. Here’s how.
 
1. Select the Albums, Events, or photos you want to make into a slideshow.
 
2. Click the Slideshow button on the toolbar or click the + (Add) button 
on the small toolbar.
 
3. Click Slideshow and add a title.
 
 Figure 13-19 shows the slideshow window you’ll see. The slideshow 
window will open in the iPhoto main window.

Choosing settings for the entire slideshow
You can change the name of your slideshow at any time by highlighting 
the current name and typing a new one. The Preview button on the toolbar 
allows you to sample your slideshow with the current settings so you can 
quickly try them out. Here’s how to select settings for your slideshow.
 
1. Click the Themes button, located in the middle of the toolbar. Figure 
13-20 shows the dialog that appears.
 
 
Figure 13-20: Choose a slideshow theme.
 
2. Click a theme to assign it to your slideshow and then click the Choose 
button.
 
3. Click the Preview button on the toolbar to see how you like the theme 
(and the music attached to the theme by default).
 
 Honestly, I think the hardest part of creating a slideshow is choosing 
which theme you want to use. They’re all fantastic.
 
4. Time for tunes. Click the Music button, also located in the middle of 
the toolbar.
 
5. When the Music Settings dialog shown in Figure 13-21 appears, you 
can choose your own music on your computer, choose one of the six 
tracks under Theme Music, or create your own playlist. When you’re 
satisfied, click the Apply button.
 
6. Click the Settings button on the toolbar.
 
 The Slideshow Settings dialog shown in Figure 13-22 appears.
 
7. Change settings for each slide or for all slides.
 
• This Slide: Click this to set a Black & White, Sepia, or Antique tone 
for the slide.

 You must do this for each slide that you want to change.
 
• All Slides: Click this to set the minimum play length for each slide.
 
 In the example, it’s set for 5 seconds.
 
 If you select the Fit Slideshow to Music radio button, the duration of 
slides is adjusted so that the slideshow and the music end together, 
automatically.
 
 
Figure 13-22: Set your slideshow settings.
 
8. Still in the Slideshow Settings dialog, select the check boxes for your 
choices.
 
• Show Title Slide: Select this check box if you want a title slide. 
Click on the small arrow in the circle next to this selection. This 

245
 Chapter 13: Showcasing Your Photos
will bring up the Title Slide. Click on the text twice and change as 
you wish. When you’re finished, click away from the text field and 
you’re done.
 
• Repeat Slideshow: Select this check box to make the slideshow 
repeat upon completion.
 
9. Set the aspect ratio from the pop-up menu, depending on where you 
plan to display the slideshow.
 
 For example, you can set the slideshow to work with the current display 
or HDTV (16:9), TV (4:3), or iPhone (3:2) displays.
 
10. When you’re finshed, click the Close button (the X in the upper-left 
corner).
Distributing your slideshow
So, your slideshow masterpiece is finished. You can run the slideshow on 
your computer or TV screen. If you want to send it to others, you can export 
it by clicking the Export button at the right side of the toolbar. (Refer to 
Figure 13-19.) That will take you through the process I describe in Chapter 11.

f you haven’t guessed already, I think iPhoto is a 
great Apple tool for bringing the best out of your 
photos and for giving you, the photographer, sev-
eral ways to enjoy and share your hard work and 
great photos.
No matter how much capability is put into software, 
though, more can always be added. Although books 
are fixed in what they can present at any one time, 
there’s nothing static about the ideas and solutions you 
find online. In this chapter, I give you ten excellent iPhoto 
resources, but there are certainly more. I encourage you to 
look around on the Web for your own terrific resources.
 
Take the time upfront to make sure that any software you try works with the 
version of iPhoto that you have.

The TechRepublic Web site is a terrific source of white papers, Webcasts, 
ideas, discussions, and downloadable software to enhance your iPhoto use. 
This site also covers lots of other products, so it might turn into a real gold-
mine for you. Just use the Search box on the TechRepublic landing page.
Shutterfly Export Assistant for iPhoto
www.shutterfly.com/downloads/features_mac.jsp
This is a Web service available to you from within iPhoto. Export Assistant — 
free! — modifies the iPhoto Export dialog so that you can select Shutterfly 
directly. When you download Shutterfly and install it, it modifies the iPhoto 
Export dialog and puts the Shutterfly button at the top with the other buttons 
so you can select it easily.
Shutterfly gives you access to a large selection of photo books, calendars, 
cards, and other printing services, in addition to those within iPhoto. 
iPhoto to Archive
www.ubermind.com/products/iphototoarchive.php
In Chapter 11, I talk about exporting your photos. You might have a number 
of reasons for doing this, one of which is saving space in your iPhoto Library 
by archiving photos that you don’t often use. Space is space, and saving 
space anywhere is important, including on an external hard drive.
iPhoto has no way to compress an exported file directly — until now, that is. 
iPhoto to Archive is a downloadable product from Übermind that modifies 
the Export dialog so that you can archive, using four choices of packaging 
and compression formats from within iPhoto.
You can choose to save the photos as JPEG, TIFF, PNG, or the photo’s 
Original format it had at the time of import, in several sizes; and you have 
several naming choices. A 15-day free trial is available. After the trial period, 
the current price is $9.95.

iPhoto Library Manager
www.fatcatsoftware.com/iplm
In Chapter 3, you can read about the advantages in having multiple iPhoto 
Libraries. However, it can become complex to try to use iPhoto alone to handle 
them. Relax! Here’s a great answer, available for free from Fat Cat Software.
There is an advanced version for which you pay, but there’s also a free ver-
sion that I recommend you try first. With this software, you can
 
✓ Create and/or add new libraries.
 
✓ Easily switch between libraries without restarting iPhoto.
 
✓ Check the Library database file size easily.
 
✓ Rebuild the Library easily.
I mention a few of the capabilities, but there are more, some of which work 
only in the paid ($20) version. For example, the version that you purchase 
lets you click and drag albums to copy to a new Library, including metadata. 
PictureItPostage by Endicia
www.pictureitpostage.com
Get a kick out of the reaction of friends and family to your gorgeous photos? 
You can get an even bigger kick by using your photos to create personalized 
U.S. postage stamps! Now, your announcements and invitations can have a 
personalized look even on the outside of the envelope.
The PictureItPostage software is free and integrates beautifully with iPhoto. 
You choose the photo, its orientation, any special effects (the software 
provides a palette of these), rotation, and colors. Then just click the Buy 
PictureItPostage button and tell Endicia the stamp’s denomination and how 
many sheets you want. A few days later, your stamps arrive. You might 
not want to use this for everyday postage, though: The cost of the stamps 
includes Endicia’s fee, so a sheet of twenty 42 cent stamps is about $19.

Duplicate Annihilator
www.brattoo.com/propaganda
Sounds like a video game, doesn’t it? Actually, Duplicate Annihilator is soft-
ware that’s useful rather than just entertaining and only $7.95. Duplicate 
Annihilator takes on the time-consuming task of comparing the images in 
your iPhoto Library to make sure that no duplicates escape. You can choose 
from several courses of action for the program to take when it finds them, 
including marking them for a later search. 
Essentials 2.1
www.ononesoftware.com/detail.php?prodLine_id=37
Although iPhoto was conceived as a tool to help “point-and-shoot” photogra-
phers achieve the most from their photos, it can also be productive for those 
who want to use more powerful tools while retaining an easy-to-use interface.
Essentials 2.1 for iPhoto might be just what you’re looking for to extend iPho-
to’s capabilities. It’s a collection of four tools that help you correct color, add 
depth of field by realistically blurring the background, add creative borders, 
and resize your photos to get larger prints.
Although onOne Software offers a free demo version, you can buy the com-
plete Essentials 2.1 for $69.99.
Keyword Manager
www.bullstorm.se/KeywordManager.php
If you like to use lots of keywords to find photos, using Keyword Manager can 
help you manage your keywords so you can quickly and easily tag all photos 
in your Library, regardless of how many photos you have and how many key-
words you want to use.
Because Keyword Manager uses iPhoto’s own keyword system internally, it’s 
completely safe. Even if you decide to stop using Keyword Manager, all your 
keywords will remain! It isn’t free ($20), but if it’s what you really need, it 
might be worth the cost.

iPhoto Buddy
www.iphotobuddy.com/index.html
Here’s another iPhoto Library manager, but this one is totally free. If you find 
the software does help you, it’s a good idea to make a donation to the soft-
ware’s author, which you can do right on the site.
iPhoto Buddy is a universal application (it runs on PPC and Intel Macs). With 
it, you can create, manage, and switch among multiple iPhoto Libraries. 
Depending on how many photos you have, there are real advantages to split-
ting your current iPhoto Library into multiple smaller ones where, perhaps, 
each new Library contains photos of only particular kinds of events, or 
photos taken in the same year or by the same camera. The possibilities for 
efficient organization are endless.
When you pick a new Library with iPhoto Buddy, it automatically quits iPhoto 
and restarts it with the Library you chose. It can also display details such as 
size; number of images in the Library; and a listing of Albums, folders, books, 
and more — all without opening the Library. 
iPhoto Mini
www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/20214
I’m sure that most of you use widgets in Dashboard on your Mac. Clever, 
small, and instantly available on your screen, you can also put widgets away 
quickly when you’re done. Enter the iPhoto Mini, which is one handy widget.
Suppose you want to quickly look at some or all the contents of your iPhoto 
Library but don’t want to start iPhoto. iPhoto Mini to the rescue! Open it to 
see a listing of all your folders and Albums. Choose one, and the photos are 
automatically scaled to fit into the widget’s window. 
From left to right, use the icons at the bottom to
 
✓ Display a list of all folders and Albums letting you choose one.
 
✓ Allow you to make the active photo your Desktop picture.
 
✓ Allow you to open the photo in several applications, such as Preview, 
Mail and Safari.

254
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Navigate through the album you chose.
 
✓ Refresh the display.
Quite a lot for a small package.

P
hotographers, whether professional or ama-
teur, love to find and exploit little tricks with 
the hardware or software they use. Sometimes, the 
tricks are undocumented, which makes finding them 
even more enjoyable. There are also skills learned 
at the “school of hard knocks” which I love to pass 
along. You’ll find some of those in this chapter.
Before You Import into iPhoto: 
When You’re Shooting
Regardless of the sophistication of the software and hardware a photogra-
pher chooses to use after a photo shoot, there are things that can and should 
be done before taking a picture. Things that’ll help ensure a good photograph 
and make the task of editing your photos simpler and more rewarding. Here 
are a few I’d like to pass along.

256
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Composition: Get closer, change your angle
One simple tip to help you get better photos to start with is to get close to 
your subject. Of course, sometimes, getting physically closer to your subject 
is impossible, if not downright dangerous. With the availability of true (opti-
cal) zoom lenses on many less-expensive cameras, though, you can now get 
closer — and better — shots in some locales. For example, if you’re shooting 
at the zoo, zoom in on that monkey’s face instead of always taking a wider-
angle shot.
And although people tend to stay in one place while shooting photos and 
let the zoom “transport” them to closer to their subject, don’t be afraid to 
see what the shot looks like from different vantage points. That’s something 
a zoom lens can’t do. I’ve often found that a shot that was marginally good 
from one angle becomes really exciting from another, opening up all kinds of 
creative possibilities.
 
As is true with all composition “rules,” they aren’t hard and fast. I’ve broken 
a few of them on occasion but always with a purpose; the scene just appealed 
to me more by breaking a rule. But don’t do it just because you didn’t know 
any better.
Don’t be afraid to try things. It’s how we learn what we like and what we 
don’t.
Keeping your resolution high
Depending on the sophistication and price of your camera, you have choices 
regarding the format of the captured photos. The camera’s resolution, on the 
other hand, is set by the capabilities of the sensor being used. My guideline 
is that you can never have too high of a resolution! But the photo format 
choice — RAW, TIFF, and JPEG to name a few — can ultimately affect resolu-
tion as well.
In the sidebar in Chapter 9, I discuss the advantages of capturing in RAW 
format. If your camera can do so, I highly recommend using that format for 
any photos that you plan to print at larger than an 8" x 10" size.
If your camera can’t capture in RAW, choose TIFF, if available — and if not, 
use the highest quality JPEG capture you can. Doing so will give you the most 
leeway when it comes to editing your photos in iPhoto.
Using a color card
At one time or another, I’m sure you all had the rude shock of taking a photo 
of a beautiful scene, only to discover that the captured photo has a color 

257
 Chapter 15: Ten Helpful Hints, Tips, and Shortcuts
cast in it. For instance, photos taken indoors where incandescent bulbs are 
prevalent often have a yellow cast. Our eyes and brain make an adjustment 
and we may not notice this, but the camera does. And, you may find, there 
aren’t any neutral colors in the photo to use for white balance in the Adjust 
tool window. You can certainly guess at what changes need to be made, but I 
know a better way.
I use a pocket-sized color card that I always take with me to ensure that I 
have a neutral color to correct with. (Figure 15-1 shows my 31/4" x 21/4" card.) I 
also have a larger version for use in large landscape scenes.
 
 
Figure 15-1: Don’t travel without a color card.
Here’s how to use a color card while you’re shooting:
 
1. Place the card near your subject.
 
 If you’re doing a portrait or photographing a group of people, have a 
person in the shot hold the card.
 
2. Take the shot.
 
 You’ll use this to set the white balance.
 
3. Take the card away and take the actual photo.
 
4. Later, in iPhoto, use the photo with the card in it. When you use the 
Adjust palette, click the White Balance eyedropper on the second 
square from the left in the bottom row. Refer to Figure 15-1.
 
 This tells you the white balance for the real shot.
 
5. Use that value as you use the Adjust tool window to edit the real 
photo.
These cards aren’t inexpensive, but if getting the color right is important, 
color cards are a great tool and convenient to carry. You can still use the 
small card for a landscape scene provided you ensure the card is in the same 
light as the subject of your photo (not always easy to do).

After You Import into iPhoto: 
Editing and Organizing
Now that you have taken your photos, it’s time for using the iPhoto tools to 
make them even better. Here are some tips I’ve found helpful for this process.
Changing the Reset button into the Revert button
In Chapter 10, I show you the wonderful capabilities of the controls in the 
Adjust tool window. (See Figure 15-2.) With them, you can change the expo-
sure, contrast, highlights, shadows, and several other characteristics of your 
photo. Being totally interactive, you can move the various sliders around to 
your heart’s content, always knowing that by clicking the Reset button, you 
could go back to the default values and undo any mistakes you had made.
 
Change reset to revert
White balance
 
Figure 15-2: The Adjust tool window with its handy Revert button.
Being able to use Reset provides you with a great safety net — that is, pro-
vided these were the first editing changes you were making. But what if they 
weren’t?

259
 Chapter 15: Ten Helpful Hints, Tips, and Shortcuts
Look at Figure 15-2 again. All these values were saved for this photo. If 
you now try to make some additional changes and then decide you don’t 
like them and want to return to the ones shown here, you have a problem. 
Clicking the Reset button puts all values back to the defaults, but these are 
not default values. Arg. You really want to revert to previous values.
Luckily, there’s an easy way out. You can, of course, choose Photos➪Revert 
to previous in the iPhoto menubar. But here’s a quicker and easier way. 
With the Adjust tool window open, press and hold the Option, and the Reset 
button becomes the Revert button. Clicking it now will remove your latest 
changes and return you to the previous values. Whew! When you let go of the 
Option key, the button again says Reset.
Culling photos of an Event
If some photos in a particular Event aren’t worth keeping, you’ll probably 
want to trash them. Just open the Event (read about Events in Chapter 4) so 
that you can see each individual photo. Then pick the one(s) to delete and 
drag it (them) to the Trash.
If you decide to save the photo after all — before emptying the Trash, that 
is — no a problem. Just drag the photo and drop it over the Events icon in 
the Source list. It knows where its home is and will return to its rightful place 
in the Event it belongs to.
Organizing is key
As the size of your iPhoto Library grows, employing some important organi-
zational techniques become even more important. After all, the real test of 
the usefulness of your Library is how quickly, accurately, and easily you can 
retrieve the photos you want.
Although you do have to invest a little upfront work, adding keywords to 
your photos directly after importing them really pays off. Everything about 
the photos is fresh in your mind, and assigning accurate and descriptive key-
words will never be easier. Even with the addition of Faces and Places capa-
bilities and the help they give in retrieving photos of interest, keywords are 
still the bedrock of any search.
I also highly recommend using Albums and Smart Albums. With appropriate 
naming of the Albums, retrieving whole groups of related photos is a cinch. 
And, of course, iPhoto handles automatic updating of Smart Albums. Read 
more about Albums in Chapter 5.

260
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Living with multiple Libraries
There’s no firm rule defining when a single iPhoto Library is so large that it 
should be saved and a new one started. For me, I think a safe rule is that a 
Library nearing 700MB is a prime candidate because not exceeding that size 
means that you can save it to a regular CD. You create an archive as well as 
a quick and easy way to switch libraries. In addition, Library size does affect 
iPhoto performance, so keeping them manageable will enhance your iPhoto 
experience and performance.
 
If you have a large amount of free external hard drive space, you can also 
archive the Library to that drive unless you feel more secure using a CD.
No matter which method you use (hard drive or media), here’s a tip to help 
you sleep better:
 
✓ If you write the library to a CD, be sure and verify that the write opera-
tion was successful. If you do the burn to a CD/DVD in the Finder or any 
of the commercial burn software packages, a Verify operation is begun 
after the burn, if you wish. I recommend doing that each time you do a 
burn.
 
✓ With either storage medium, immediately make sure you can use 
the archived library with iPhoto. (Remember: You’re counting on it!) 
Press and hold the Option key when starting iPhoto and then choose the 
archived Library as the one to use. Or, use the iPhoto Library Manager 
(as I describe in Chapter 14) to do this.
 
Never assume that your copy is successful until you test it!
Comments, comments, comments
Adding a description (or as I call them, comments) to a photo can be a chance 
to add a narrative that more extensively explains the circumstances of the 
photo than you can accomplish by using a few keywords. Photos are the 
video recording of an event, but to explain what led to the event or what hap-
pened just before the photo was taken requires some text. For such photos, 
I recommend taking the time to add comments when you’re importing them. 
As a reminder, the easiest ways to do this are:
 
✓ Click Photos in the Source list. For any photo, click on the small informa-
tion icon in the right corner. When the photo flips over, you’ll see the 
area labeled Enter Description. Start typing.
 
✓ Highlight a photo in the iPhoto main window, then click the information 
icon in the center of the small toolbar. At the bottom of the information 
window that pops up is the area to type a description.

261
 Chapter 15: Ten Helpful Hints, Tips, and Shortcuts
Another nice thing is that editing a photo’s description changes it in the 
photo Library as well as in all Albums and books where it appears. Do it once 
in the photo, and the rest is taken care of by iPhoto.
Speeding up iPhoto startup time
This particular tip will be helpful regardless of the speed of your computer 
although it will certainly have a greater effect on a slower machine.
Ever wonder why it takes applications, including iPhoto, so long to start? A 
lot of necessary activity takes place, but in the case of iPhoto, there’s also 
something wasteful going on. It has to do with languages, and here’s how to 
trim down the memory required to load them:
 
1. In the Applications folder on your hard drive, click the iPhoto icon.
 
2. Choose File➪Get Info or press Ô+I.
 
 In the iPhoto Info dialog that appears (see Figure 15-3), see how (under 
Languages) that every box is checked. I don’t know about you, but I 
speak only English (and a little Italian), so having all these other lan-
guages loaded each time iPhoto starts really takes time and for no 
purpose.
 
 
Figure 15-3: The iPhoto Info dialog.

262
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
3. In the Languages section, clear (uncheck) each check box for each 
unneeded language.
 
 In my case, I leave only English loaded.
 
4. Close the Get Info dialog.
 
 The next time you start iPhoto, you should see at least some improve-
ment in loading speed, at least a second or two — perhaps a lot. You also 
will see between a 15–20% decrease in the real memory used by iPhoto.
A simple thing, but it does make a difference.
Customizing iPhoto keyboard shortcuts
Using keyboard shortcuts can save you a lot of time and wasted motion when 
working with an application like iPhoto. Instead of moving your hand to use 
the mouse and select from a menu, you can just type the necessary shortcut.
The nice thing on Macs is that you can set your own shortcuts in OS X for 
particular applications, like iPhoto. Here’s how:
 
1. In System Preferences, click the Keyboard & Mouse icon.
 
2. Click the Keyboard Shortcuts tab.
 
3. Click the + (Add) button just below the list of current shortcuts. See 
Figure 15-4.
 
 In the dialog that appears, you can select the application you’re creating 
the shortcut for (in this case, iPhoto) and the menu title (which, in this 
case, must be the exact name of the iPhoto command). So before you go 
any further, you need to find the command in the iPhoto menu so you 
know exactly what it says.
 
4. In the Keyboard Shortcut field, just press the keys you want, in the 
order you want.
 
 I used Option+Ô+B. See Figure 15-5. First, though, I checked all the cur-
rent iPhoto shortcuts to make sure that I didn’t duplicate one. An easy 
way to do this is to look through each iPhoto menu and see what’s being 
used.

Click to add a keyboard shortcut
 
Figure 15-4: Adding a keyboard shortcut.
 
Assign the shortcut here
 
Figure 15-5: Assigning your shortcut.
 
5. Click Add.
 
 The Keyboard Shortcuts pane now contains your new shortcut. If, after 
all your careful checking, you have chosen an already used shortcut in 
iPhoto, the shortcut will be removed from where it was so your short-
cut will work. For instance, if I wanted the Share➪Email choice to have 

264
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Shift+Command+E as a shortcut, I can do that but since it used to be the 
shortcut for File➪Export it won’t be any longer. If that’s okay with you, 
it’s okay with iPhoto. Check it out in Figure 15-6.
 
The new shortcut
 
Figure 15-6: See your added keyboard shortcut.
 
6. Try out your new shortcut to make sure it works.
 
 If the shortcut didn’t work, maybe you used a combination for the short-
cut that isn’t allowed. Try something else and repeat the process.
