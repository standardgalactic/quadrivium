PREFACE 
This book explores the nature of engineering and technology through 
case studies of familiar objects, from paper clips and aluminum cans to 
airplanes and modern high-rise buildings. These real-world artifacts (some 
of קhich I have written about before) are approached here from a per­
spective designed to illuminate different facets of the engineering enter­
prise-design, analysis, failure, economics, aesthetics, communications, 
politics, and quality control, to name but a few. The case studies also 
touch on a variety of engineering fields, including aeronautical, civil, 
computer, electrical, environmental, manufacturing, mechanical, and 
structural engineering. 
I am grateful to the many designers, inventors, engineers, and entre­
preneurs who have written to me about my earlier books and articles and 
who have shared their personal experiences. The case studies that I revisit 
in this book reflect new information gained from this correspondence­
especially from inventors and engineers who participated in the develop­
ment of the artifacts involved. Their elaboration of details has enabled 
me to tell more complete stories, to bring the material up to date, and to 
augment it with information about new and derivative products. I am also 
grateful to the many design theorists with whom I have corresponded and 
whom I have met in the course of traveling and lecturing. They have not 
only been gracious hosts but also have shared their references, insights, 
and approaches to the subject. 
The rudiments of this book were first drafted in 1992 at Duke Univer­
sity in anticipation of teaching a new course employing case studies to 
introduce engineering students and others to the nature of invention, 
design, and development. I am grateful to the National Science Founda­
tion for a grant that released me from teaching more traditional engineer­
ing courses at that time. Several classes of Duke students have now used 
Vil 

various parts of the book and offered feedback that has guided successive 
revisions of the manuscript. I wish to thank especially Tonya Dale, Nayer 
El-Esnawy, and Ian Threlfall, who have served as teaching and research 
assistants for the course. 
I am once again grateful to Albert Nelius, former head of circulation 
in Duke's William R. Perkins Library, and Eric Smith, fonner head of the 
Vesic Engineering Library. Dianne Himler has continued to secure es­
sential library materials for me, and my graduate student, Aiman Kuzmar, 
while finishing his own dissertation in civil engineering, identified the 
materials that provided the background for the chapter on the fax ma­
chine. 
Several editors and anonymous reviewers of an earlier version of the 
manuscript made suggestions that helped to shape its final form. I wish 
to express my sincere thanks to Harvard University Press's Michael G. 
Fisher, Ann Downer-Hazell, Susan Wallace Boehmer, and Jill Breitbarth 
for the enthusiasm, care, and help that have made turning the manuscript 
into this book a pleasurable experience. 
As always, my daughter and son, Karen and Stephen, have been sources 
of inspiration. And my wife, Catherine Petroski, whose own writing I 
admire so much, continues to be my most cherished reader.

INT R ODUCT I ON 
The products of engineering are all around us. The computer on which 
these words were typed is an obvious example, as is the air conditioning 
system that keeps us (and our computers) comfortable even though it is 
hot and humid outside the building-which is also a product of engineer­
ing. When we do go outside physically, we often ride in an automobile 
on roads and highways with tunnels and bridges, and when we go outside 
metaphorically, we use telephones, videotapes, faxes, and computer net­
works. All of these are products of engineering design, manufacturing, 
and construction. Indeed, the world of our everyday experience is shaped 
by the practice of engineering and technology, and the world shapes those 
activities in tum. But what is engineering, what are its origins, and how 
do engineers practice it? And what is technology, what are its roots, and 
how does it relate to the rest of experience? This book explores such 
questions. 
The process by which a high-tech computer gets from an inventor's 
brainstorm to our desk, or by which an innovative bridge gets transformed 
from some engineer's dream to a spectacular structure, is seldom straight­
forward. It can entail decades of painstakingly slow research and devel­
opment, followed by weeks of frenzied activity. In addition, each engi­
neering project is touched by the idiosyncracies of individual engineers, 
companies, communities, and marketplaces. And there are questions of 
economics, politics, aesthetics, and ethics. Furthermore, each engineer­
ing project is highly dependent upon the availability of raw materials of 
varying quality. And though engineering is the art of rearranging the 
materials and forces of nature, the immutable laws of nature are forever 
constraining the engineer as to how those rearrangements can or cannot 
be made. 
This book attempts to make sense of many of these interrelated aspects 

of engineering. But rather than beginning with large structures or systems 
and the attendant mathematics and science that it takes to fully compre­
hend them, the book begins with a close look at some familiar objects. 
They may appear to be so simple as not to require any sophisticated 
engineering at all. But saying that these object do not require advanced 
engineering is not to say that these objects do not embody engineering 
principles. A self-taught and gifted inventor who comes up with some 
clever device and makes a million dollars on the idea uses thought 
processes not unlike those used by the graduate of an engineering school 
in designing and developing a new device to collect soil samples on Mars 
and bring them back to Earth. And as simple as familiar objects may seem 
at first glance, their conception, development, manufacturing, and mar­
keting may pose great difficulties. 
Engineering is a fundamental human process that has been practiced 
from the earliest days of civilization. Today, its methods have been pro­
fessionalized and formalized, and its essential calculational nature has 
been greatly enhanced by the electronic computer. But that is not to say 
that the skills and discipline required to do good engineering are totally 
different from those exhibited by craftspersons throughout history. Mod­
ern engineering is a more highly mathematical and scientific endeavor, 
but its practice still requires a good deal of commonsense reasoning about 
materials, structures, energy, and the like. Mathematics and science help 
us to analyze existing ideas and their embodiment in "things," but these 
analytical tools do not in themselves give us those ideas. We have to think 
and scheme about nature and existing artifacts and figure out how they 
can be altered and improved to better achieve objectives considered 
beneficial to humankind. 
The idea of design and development is what most distinguishes engi­
neering from science, which concerns itself principally with understand­
ing the world as it is. Engineers throughout history have wrestled with 
problems of water not being where it was needed, of minerals not being 
close at hand, of building materials having to be moved. Ancient engineers 
were often called upon to devise means of erecting great monuments, to 
design defenses against enemies, and to move people and goods across 
rough terrain and rougher water. By the Renaissance, engineers such as 
Leonardo da Vinci were coming up with more ideas than they could 
realize, and others such as Galileo were laying the foundations for the 
analytical methods that students now learn in engineering school. The 
Industrial Revolution brought a proliferation of new machines and manu-
I N V E N T I O N  BY

facturing techniques, and this in turn provided an impetus for the growth 
of science and commerce on the international scale that we know today. 
The history of engineering is rich with stories of success triumphing 
over failure; they are the basis not only for the technical but also the 
cultural background of engineering. Studying past cases of exemplary 
engineering, as superseded as their technology might be, can provide 
much insight into how we can approach some of the most challenging 
problems of today and come up with rewarding solutions. The stories of 
how engineers approached their problems and exercised their judgment 
have much to teach us about some of the fundamental, if not innate, 
characteristics of the human endeavor known as engineering. 
CASE ST U D I E S 
Case studies of artifacts or of particular products, projects, and processes 
enable us to understand engineering in the broad context in which it is 
actually practiced. While case studies must necessarily vary in their degree 
of detail and completeness, common features of engineering become 
evident as the stories reinforce one another and reveal aspects of the 
engineering method. Each case study presented here could itself be 
expanded into a book about what other alternatives might have been 
pursued or what improvements might still be made, for no engineering 
problem is ever completely solved to everyone's satisfaction. Engineering 
is the art of compromise, and there is always room for improvement in 
the real world. But engineering is also the art of the practical; engineers 
realize that they must at some point curtail design and begin to manufac­
ture or build. 
The paper clip, for example, is seemingly so simple and insignificant 
an object that we tend to use it while hardly noticing it. In Chapter 2, 
the paper clip is looked at under the microscope of technological criticism 
to see what it can teach us about design. In fact, the design and manu­
facture of a successful paper clip is an enormous challenge, as this case 
study reveals, and one that continues to this day. The most familiar paper 
clip, known as the Gem, is actually a far-from-perfect artifact, and since 
the Gem was introduced in the late nineteenth century inventors have 
patented many new designs. Looking more closely at the Gem and at 
some of the hundreds of patents for improvements on it provides insight 
into the nature of engineering design, and particularly into the question 
how an artifact that on close inspection is far from perfect can dominate 
the marketplace. 
I N T R O D U C T I O N

In Chapter 3, the case study of the pencil illustrates the means by 
which engineers analyze and quantify how things function in order to 
improve them. We all know that a pencil point will break if we press too 
hard upon it, but how hard is too hard? As users of pencils, we could try 
to play it safe and press very lightly so that our points would never break, 
but circumstances arise when pressing lightly will not . be acceptable. 
Multiple-copy forms require us to print firmly, and to do so we must bear 
down on the pencil point. It is only after we break a few points off our 
pencil that we learn how to avoid breaking further ones. We can infer 
from our negative experiences how hard we can press on a pencil before 
it will break. We can also learn that a pencil point is less likely to break 
if we use a better pencil, if we hold the pencil more vertically, and if we 
use a blunter point. Alternatively, we could change our brand or type of 
pencil to one that has been improved so that it has a tougher point and 
does not break so easily. All such observations naturally have implications 
for larger engineering structures and systems as well. 
The oftentimes long and arduous nature of development that follows 
the initial conception and even patenting of a promising device is exem­
plified in the story of the zipper, recounted in Chapter 4. The origins and 
history of this now ubiquitous slide fastener show the important role that 
financial backing and patience play in enabling a technical endeavor to 
proceed to commercial success. While the problem of developing a 
reliable zipper and manufacturing it in an economical fashion presented 
enormous technical challenges to the engineers involved, establishing a 
viable market for the product proved to be almost as elusive. 
Another familiar artifact that puts a virtual engineering laboratory in 
our hands is the aluminum beverage can, the case study presented in 
Chapter 5. Understanding its origins and the constraints within which it 
has been developed helps us to understand, among other things, the 
key importance of failure criteria in engineering. The aluminum can 
was not developed as an end in itself but rather as a central component 
in the infrastructure of distributing beverages reliably in individual por­
tions measured in the billions. When such large numbers are involved, 
the cost of each single unit plays a deciding role in the product's design. 
Though economic considerations are of great importance, technologi­
cal realities remain uppermost in determining how engineering shapes a 
product. For example, in designing a beverage can, not only must engi­
neers fashion a can that will hold the beverage without contaminating it 
or allowing it to leak after rough shipping and handling, but they must 
I N V E NT I O N  BY 
D E S I G N  
4 

also make the can easy to open and pour or drink from. Furthermore, 
while aluminum cans are a great convenience, they also represent an 
enormous potential waste of raw materials and energy, and getting rid of 
them raises significant issues of litter and waste disposal. Exploring the 
difficulties of satisfying numerous opposing goals and seeing how engi­
neers and others have wrestled with such problems helps us to better 
understand the interplay between engineering, economics, and the envi­
ronment generally. One aluminum can in isolation is one thing, but in 
the context of its billions of clones the aluminum can is quite another. 
The story of the fax machine, told in Chapter 6, is the saga of a piece 
of sophisticated equipment that had its beginnings in the nineteenth 
century but could not develop into the user-friendly device it now is before 
a communications network over which data could be transmitted was put 
in place. The extraordinary rise in use of the fax machine that began in 
the 1980s had as much to do with government deregulation, standards 
development, and cultural imperatives as it did with pure technology. 
Engineering can never operate effectively in a vacuum. 
Much engineering design and development that takes place in the 
modern context must proceed with a clear sense of worldwide develop­
ments, as the case history of commercial jet aircraft so effectively illus­
trates. As told in Chapter 7, the story of the Boeing 777 -the twin-engine 
wide-body airliner that was introduced into passenger service in 1995 -
also provides an opportunity to examine the increasing role that digital 
computers now play not only in designing, testing, and manufacturing but 
also in operating some of the most complex machines and systems intro­
duced in the late twentieth century. The enormous capacity and power 
demonstrated by the computer hardware and software used in such ap­
plications set the stage for engineering in the twenty-first century. 
Not all engineers dream of designing large aircraft or other highly 
visible structures, for some engineers find the most elusive dreams in 
doing less ostensibly dramatic things more effectively, such as providing 
safe water supplies, disposing of waste, or cleaning up the environment. 
Because engineering is so inextricably involved with society and its goals, 
the practice of engineering is a very social endeavor, and this is perhaps 
nowhere so evident as in the case of water supply and disposal, presented 
in Chapter 8. In this field, even when the individual engineer is working 
alone at a desk, computer terminal, or drawingboard, every part of his or 
her work must potentially interface with everything else on a technical as 
well as a nontechnical level. In fact, no artifact or system that any engineer 
I N T R O D U C T I O N  
5 

designs or analyzes can function independent of a larger social system, 
and the best designers and analysts are those who are constantly aware of 
the interrelationships of all things. 
The story of just about any large bridge project can serve to illuminate 
the essential complexity of large projects, especially with regard to the 
political environment in which the engineering must procצed. In Chapter 
9, the case history of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge shows the 
long gestation time typical of many large projects, as well as the numerous 
alternatives that can come to be proposed along the way. Issues of clear­
ance for shipping, right of way for bridge approaches, rights of ferry 
operators, financial responsibility for construction, capacity of the bridge, 
aesthetics, and a host of different but interrelated problems experienced 
in the context of a specific bridge provide a paradigm for understanding 
great engineering projects generally. 
In the late twentieth century, engineering has been greatly influenced 
by the introduction of systems of all kinds into virtually every aspect of 
every project, and the ancient art of building construction is no exception. 
The essential role that elevators and other systems have played in the 
evolution of the modern skyscraper is presented in Chapter 10. What 
might superficially be viewed as a structural engineering endeavor turns 
out to involve electrical, environmental, and mechanical engineering as 
well. Such interactions across traditional professional boundaries are ever­
increasing and are sure to be a key component of twenty-first-century 
engineering. 
By looking through engineering eyes at the things we encounter in 
everyday life, we come to see technological lessons in even the simplest 
of objects. Although we can admire products of elegant engineering and 
see them as examples to be emulated, it is also in being able to criticize 
poor engineering that we better comprehend how the made things of this 
world work and can be improved. A healthy sense of criticism is what 
gives the best inventors, designers, and engineers their edge, and it is also 
what drives the evolution of the made world and of technology. If we were 
content with everything around us, we would have no conception of 
improvement and the world would be a static place. While some might 
welcome that conservative approach, in which fewer risks were taken and 
fewer surprises would occur, it would also mean the curtailment of 
progress as embodied in the dreams of engineers, politicians, and people 
generally. Indeed, it has been held by some engineers that by not striv­
ing for more and more economical construction, the engineering profes-
I N V E N T I O N  B Y  D E S I G N  
6 

sion would be irresponsibly appropriating limited resources to overdesign 
everything from beverage cans to bridges. While safe artifacts and systems 
of all kinds are clearly very important for the society that finances them, 
every dollar that goes unnecessarily into strength may be a dollar that is 
not available for other needs, such as conservation or maintenance. In 
the real world, such questions become inextricably intertwined with po­
litical and social issues, from which engineering problems are never 
immune.

A N D D E SIGN 
A paper clip appears to be among the simplest of objects. In its most 
common form, it consists of a four-inch-long piece of wire shaped by three 
bends into a thing that is both pleasing to look at and easy to use. It comes 
fully assembled, and no batteries are required for its operation. No one 
expects instructions to come with a box of paper clips, and we tend not 
to think very much about how they are made and used. We take paper 
clips, as we do a lot of familiar artifacts, for granted, and seldom give them 
a second thought. They seem to be just too simple and ubiquitous to be 
very interesting or instructive. However, sometimes the simplest of things 
can hold as much mystery and provide as many lessons about the nature 
of engineering as the most complex. 
When an object is simple and small enough to hold in our hand and 
turn about at will, we can inspect it to our heart's content to see for 
ourselves how it is made and how it works. If the artifact is inexpensive 
enough, we can each have an adequate supply to break open or test or 
experiment with in any way that might help us understand how the object 
is made and how it works. If the principles on which the object functions 
are conceptually simple and clearly visible, then we can explore questions 
of how we ourselves might engineer an improved version. Finally, the 
artifact can serve as a gripping metaphor for engineering itself. 
Pick up a box of paper clips and examine it. The box is likely to have 
a minimum of information printed on it: The brand name (perhaps 
ACCO, which seems to be just another anonymous acronym, or Noesting, 
which seems to be an unpronounceable nonsense word); a name describ­
ing the kind of paper clips (perhaps Gem or Perfect Gem or Nifty or 
Peerless or Ideal-certainly something positive-sounding); the quantity in 
the package (usually a nice round number, like 100, but does anyone ever 
really count the number of paper clips in the box?); a catalog or stock 
number (so the supply can be replenished); possibly the address of the 
8 

manufacturer (so the purchasing department knows where to reorder or 
locate a supplier, or complain about the product); most likely that ubiq­
uitous UPC (universal product code) barcode that enables checkout 
counters to be automated; and, more likely a factor in selling the box than 
almost anything else printed on it, a picture of the kind of paper clips 
inside. 
One thing that is not likely to be on a box of paper clips is instructions 
for use. We are all expected to know how to use these clever little objects, 
as readily as we know how to open the box and remove a clip, but we 
might be hard pressed to explain in words alone how to attach a single 
paper clip to a group of papers. 
Let's open a box of paper clips and take one out, an action we are likely 
to perform without looking, letting our fingers select a clip from the top 
of the pile. We seldom, if ever, stop to admire or marvel at the paper clip. 
If our other hand holds the papers to be fastened, we may glance at the 
paper clip to see if it is oriented properly to slide onto the papers; if it is 
not, we will manipulate it around in our fingers without a thought. As we 
bring the clip to the papers, we will unconsciously notice the loops that 
must be slid one on each side of the papers. Experience will have taught 
us that a standard paper clip will not just slide automatically onto the 
papers, however; we must open the clip, most commonly by a rather subtle 
action of pressing the end of the longer loop against one side of the paper 
(which one of our fingers backs up and stiffens), while at the same time 
flexing the clip just enough so that it can be slid down on the papers with 
its smaller loop on the other side. This all takes place so quickly and 
automatically that the complex small motor skills required are usually 
overlooked, yet this action of applying the paper clip is central to its 
use-and to our appreciation of it as a piece of engineering. 
T H E  S P R I N G I N ESS O F  M A T E R I A LS 
The paper clip works because its loops can be spread apart just enough 
to get it around some papers and, when released, can spring back to grab 
the papers and hold them. This springing action, more than its shape per 
se, is what makes the paper clip work. Springiness, and its limits, are also 
critical for paper clips to be made in the first place. To appreciate this, 
open a paper clip a bit wider than needed to get the loops around some 
papers. There will be a point at which the clip will be bent out of shape 
and will not return to the flat pattern that it had when fresh out of the 
box. When this happens, the clip's elastic limit is said to have been 
P A P E R  C L I P S 
A N D  D E S I G N  
9 

exceeded (or the wire is said to have been plastically deformed), and it is 
extremely difficult to restore the clip to the shape it had in the box. 
Needless to say, the clip is also no longer as effective in holding papers 
or in lying flat upon them. 
Every material that engineers work with, whether it be timber, iron, 
concrete, or the steel wire of paper clips, has a characteristic springiness 
to it (not unlike the springiness of a rubber band), and the spring manifests 
itself in everything made of these materials. This behavior of materials 
was no doubt observed long before Aristotle's time, but it was a particular 
topic of discussion in that Greek philosopher's circle. In a collection of 
"mechanical problems" compiled in the fourth century B.C., the question 
was asked, 'Why are pieces of timber weaker the longer they are, and why 
do they bend more easily when raised?" We have certainly all observed 
this behavior of long pieces of most everything: two by fours, spaghetti, 
pencil leads, plastic rulers, yardsticks, and so on. Anything slender can be 
bowed easily, and the longer the easier, yet if not broken or plastically 
deformed it will regain its straightness when put down. This is spring 
action, and it was not fully understood until about 2000 years after 
Aristotle's time. 
Even the great Galileo did not fully recognize that all bodies have a 
certain springiness, and, as we shall see in Chapter 3, this led him to 
make some fundamental errors in his seminal work on strength of mate­
rials, published in 1638. It remained for Robert Hooke, a contemporary 
of Newton, to articulate the essential elements of elasticity. Hooke was an 
early advocate of the microscope and so was inclined to look closely at 
natural and artificial objects and to see things that other scientists over­
looked. (Among the first observations Hooke reported in his Micrographia, 
published in 1665, related to the details of simple objects, such as the 
point of a needle or the edge of a razor.) 
There was fierce competition among seventeenth-century scientists 
over priority of discovery of everything from calculus and natural laws to 
clever new devices, and so publishing a discovery in a cryptic manner 
established that one had made the discovery without having to reveal the 
details of it until the busy scientist or inventor had the time or inclination 
to do so in the way one would now, in the form of a scientific paper or a 
patent application. Although Hooke discovered the nature of spring force 
as early as 1660, he did not publish his observation about the elasticity or 
springiness of materials until 1678, and then in the form of an anagram. 
The customary language of the time was Latin, and anagrams then did

IO 

not have to spell out something apposite as they are expected to today (for 
example, THEY SEE is an good modern anagram of THE EYES). Thus, 
Hooke's anagram was presented with the letters in alphabetical order, as 
follows: ceiiinosssttuv. When he was ready to articulate his principle, he 
rearranged the letters to spell out, Ut tensio sic vis, which is commonly 
translated by the phrase, "As the extension so the force." 
What Hooke had discovered was that, up to a limit, each object 
stretches in proportion to the force applied to it. Conversely, the more we 
stretch something elastic, the more resistance it offers to being further 
stretched. Thus if we pull a rubber band with twice as much force, it 
stretches twice as far. If we hold a very long piece of spaghetti by one end, 
it sags in a gentle but barely perceptible curve. Here the weight of the 
spaghetti itself is the force doing the pulling, and the stretching results 
from the bending that occurs. If the piece of spaghetti were too long, it 
could break, as it will if we cause it to vibrate, which adds the force of 
inertia to that of gravity and causes curving and bending beyond the 
Hookean, or elastic, limit. When the spaghetti or its broken parts are put 
back on the table, they are straight again, with the table providing support. 
These springing phenomena are manifestations of Hooke's Law, and 
they (along with many other phenomena of materials and structures) 
affect the behavior of airplane wings and bridges and skyscrapers and 
paper clips and virtually everything mechanical and structural that engi­
neers design. Heavy wire cables that support elevators in skyscrapers have 
a springiness that is exaggerated by the extreme length of the cable, and 
the bounce it produces can be unsettling to passengers if not properly 
taken into account in designing the elevator system. 
A degree of elasticity can be very helpful in the operation of even the 
simplest of objects. If a straight pin, for example, did not have sufficient 
flexibility to allow it to bend a bit as it was threaded through a piece of 
fabric, the pin would tend to be more difficult to use and would not work 
as well. Furthermore, if it did not have enough spring and tended to stay 
crooked or plastically deformed whenever so slightly bent, it would not 
be so easily reusable. Although primarily intended to hold clothing to­
gether before buttons were commonplace, straight pins, like all techno­
logical artifacts, also came to be cleverly adapted for other uses. One 
important use was to attach papers together, long before anything like a 
modern paper clip was developed. To this day one can find pins used in 
this manner in third-world countries and in banking and brokerage busi­
nesses that cannot tolerate the risk of a paper clip slipping off documents

teenth century the term "paper clip" more often than not meant a rather 
large metal clamp much like the kind that is found on clipboards today. 
But well into the twentieth century the straight pin remained a most 
common means of keeping a few sheets of paper together.

FORMING 
WIRE INTO PAPER CLIPS 
The kinds of wire used for centuries for making pins was also suitable for 
making paper clips, but the idea of a bent wire paper clip is more obvious 
in retrospect than in prospect. Bending wire into clever shapes is a very 
old concept, and even the Romans had such devices as safety pins. But 
before the advent of wire-working machinery in the mid- to late-nine­
teenth century, the process for making even a single pin or needle was 
rather long and tedious. In his famous book on the wealth of nations, the 
eighteenth-century Scottish economist Adam Smith used pin making as 
a prime example of division of labor and its economic benefits. Each step 
in the process was performed by a separate individual, and collectively 
they could make 4800 pins per day. Smith estimated that if an individual 
uninitiated to the techniques did all the steps on a single pin, the output 
might not even approach 20 pins per day. The famous French encyclo­
pedia edited by Denis Diderot described pin and needle making in the 
late eighteenth century and illustrated parts of the process (Fig. 2.2). It 
was not hard to see the advantages of designing machinery to perform 
automatically all the tedious steps of pin making, but it was not until the 
1 830s that the American inventor John Howe succeeded in developing 
an effective pin-making machine (Fig. 2.3). Such a machine has been on

Paper clips could certainly be made by hand, just as pins had been for 
so long, but since pins served the purpose there was no pressing need to 
make such specialized objects as paper clips. With the development of 
the Industrial Revolution and the concomitant need to handle more and 
more volumes of paper as businesses expanded first nationally and then 
internationally, extremely specialized devices such as paper clips could 
INVENTION BY DESIGN 
14 

be sold in such quantities as to make their manufacture worthwhile, if it 
could be done effectively. 
Imagine how paper clips might be made by hand. They would most 
likely start much as a pin did, with a piece of wire pulled off a spool and 
straightened and cut to the appropriate length, say about four inches. This 
wire would have its spring, of course, but the fact that there was a limit 
to the spring would make the forming of a paper clip possible. As the wire 
was bent beyond the elastic limit, it would retain the bent shape. With 
the experience gained of trial and error, one could learn how to bend the 
wire, perhaps with the help of some pointed pliers, just far enough beyond 
the limit so that when the wire was released it would spring back to just 
the right shape. One could, after a while, develop a facility in doing this 
bending, and one could devise arrangements of pegs or jigs around which 
or in which to work the wire. In this way more paper clips could be made 
and, incidentally, made more quickly, and one might be able to make 
them inexpensively enough to sell for prices competitive with the pins 
they would displace in the office. Since pin making had become auto­
mated by the time wire paper clips were conceived, it essentially meant 
that paper clip making also had to be automated to produce a competitive 
product. 
But paper clips could not have replaced straight pins on the basis of 
competitive price alone, and this brings us to one of the central techno­
logical ideas of invention and innovation and the roles that engineers play. 
A new artifact will displace an existing one only if there is a clear 
advantage that the new holds over the old. The most direct and successful 
means of establishing an advantage is to point out the shortcomings and 
failings of existing technology and to show how the new device serves to 
remove objections to the old. Nothing is perfect, and even the most 
traditional and established ways of doing things leave something to be 
desired. If a new artifact can be shown to overcome one or more incon­
trovertible disadvantages of an old, then there is likely to be some artifac­
tual succession or evolutionary displacement. Generally speaking, how­
ever, the very fact that long-existing artifacts have become so familiar also 
means that people have adapted to any inconveniences or problems 
associated with their use. In fact, it is at first often only the inventor or 
engineer, effectively acting as technological critic, who even sees anything 
wrong with things as they are. But, once articulated, the problems that 
just one critic clearly points out will be immediately obvious to everyone. 
P A P E R  C L I P S A N D  D E S I G N  
15 

If a new invention removes those problems, then it has a chance of 
succeeding. 
The problems that late-nineteenth-century inventors found with the 
straight pin as paper fastener we;e several. It was difficult to thread through 
more than a few sheets of paper; it left holes in the paper; its point could 
prick one's finger; it could catch extraneous papers; it bulked up piles of 
paper. A flat paper clip that slid on and off a group of papers could be 
readily seen to do the job better by removing, or at least reducing, many 
if not all of these objections. Thus it was that early paper clips could 
displace pins in office use. But, as with many new products, early versions 
of the paper clip themselves soon came under criticism by other inventors. 
Early paper clips were generally not as easy to attach as subsequently 
conceived versions; early paper clips slipped off too easily; early paper 
clips got tangled together; etc., etc. 
Whenever an inventor got an idea for a "new, improved" paper clip, 
its advantages were argued in contrast to the relative disadvantages of the 
old. A plethora of paper clip patents was issued around the turn of the 
century, but very few of the designs touted so successfully in the patent 
applications have survived. This is not surprising, since as each new 
artifact comes on the scene it becomes an object of criticism, especially 
by inventors who can imagine how this or that shortcoming (which, at 
first, only they see) can be removed, perhaps just by giving this or that leg 
of a paper clip a slightly different bend, turn, or twist. Not every inventor 
would choose to patent a new paper clip design, however, for various 
reasons. Some chose not to patent because the cost of the patent appli­
cation seemed too high, others did not believe that the patent system was 
the best way to encourage invention, others felt they could maintain a 
better competitive advantage by keeping a trade secret than by revealing 
a new process in a patent application in exchange for the right to sue 
infringe rs. 
T H E  G E M  P A P E R  C L I P  
For whatever reason, the most successful paper clip design, and the one 
that has become virtually synonymous with "paper clip," was never pat­
ented. Indeed, the concept of what has come to be known as the Gem 
clip clearly existed in the late nineteenth century because a patent was 
issued to William Middlebrook, of Waterbury, Connecticut, for a machine 
(Fig. 2.4) for making paper clips, and the patent drawings clearly show a 
fully formed Gem as the raison d'etre of the machine. Middlebrook's 1 899

patent incidentally shows that the standard history of the Gem paper clip, 
which credits its invention to a Norwegian named Johan Vaaler, is in fact 
not correct. 
While Vaaler and other turn-of-the-century inventors were in fact pat­
enting all manner of shapes and sizes of paper clips (see Fig. 2.5), 
Middlebrook was patenting the means for forming the Gem clip economi­
cally. Without machines like his, no paper clip could have challenged 
the machine-made pins very effectively. The complexity of Middlebrook's 
machine is clear from his patent drawings, and it is apparent that he was 
engaged in serious mechanical engineering as opposed to just doodling 
to find a new shape of paper clip. There could be many shapes of clip 
that can hold a pile of papers just about as well as, if not better than, a 
Gem, but the ability to manufacture the clips reliably and in large 
quantities is what would make or break a company. Why Middlebrook 
chose the Gem design to manufacture may be subject to speculation, but 
it clearly is the clip that the machine was designed to shape. The princi­
ples upon which the machine works, bending wire around pegs, are well 
suited to the Gem design and it to them. In short, Middlebrook's machine 
and the Gem were made for each other. But if not from Vaaler and his 
contemporaries, from where did the Gem come? 
Believed to have been introduced in England in the late nineteenth 
century by a company known as Gem, Limited, the now-familiar paper 
clip that took its manufacturer's name soon became firmly established 
as the paper clip to which all others were compared. Patents continued 
to be issued for improvements in paper clips, but none displaced the 
Gem. Today, when an icon for the paper clip is needed to label a com­
puter's desktop organizer or to warn against jamming copier machines, it 
is the Gem that seems invariably to be employed. Newer clips, such as 
the plastic-coated wire variety, are shaped like Gems, although their 
proportions never seem to be quite right. One of the latest genuine 
improvements in (Gem) paper clips is the introduction of a turned-up lip 
on the end of the inner loop. This enables the unopened clip to be truly 
slid on the papers, and there is no need for the user to spread the loops 
of the clip apart manually. But, as with just about all improvements, there 
is a trade off. This new clip is not flat, and so it adds further bulk to a pile 
of papers. 
In fact, this new improvement is not even all that new, for it was clearly 
present in at least one version of paper clip patented in 1903 by George 
McGill of Riverdale-on-Hudson, New York. Several versions of his clip, 
I N V E N T I O N  BY 
D E S I G N  
18 

as illustrated in the patent drawings (Fig. 2.6), show clearly that McGill 
also sought to improve the Gem by turning up or putting an eye or bulb 
on the ends of the wire, which tended to catch and rip the paper upon 
removal, as well as to introduce a turned-up end on the inner loop to 
make application easier. 
I M P R OV E M E N T S  IN P A P E R  CLI P S  
Inventors are always looking for things to improve, and for about a century 
the Gem has been the main target of criticism in patents for new and 
improved paper clips. For example, one clear challenge to the Gem was 
patented in 1934 and has come to be known as the Gothic clip (Fig. 2. 7), 
because its loops are pointed more to resemble Gothic arches than the 
rounded Romanesque ones of the Gem. Henry Lankenau's patent appli­
cation for the "perfect Gem" also listed ease of applying to papers as one 
of the invention's advantages. More importantly, the Gothic clip has 
longer legs that extend almost to its squared end, thus reducing the 
possibility that their sharp ends would catch and tear paper. Since the 
danger of tearing papers or the pages of books is minimized with this clip, 
it can typically be made of heavier wire to give it better gripping power. 
While it is also more expensive, the Gothic clip is favored by some users, 
such as librarians, because of its distinct advantages. 
There are other ways to improve the paper clip, and among the most 
often tried is economizing on raw materials, a common object of engi­
neering design and manufacturing. After the capital investment that goes 
into the machinery to make paper clips, the wire that is used is the single 
most controllable factor in determining cost and hence price. Because 
invention, design, engineering, and manufacturing are always bound by 
the laws of nature, only so much savings can be effected by reducing the 
quality of the wire used. There must be just the right spring to the paper­
clip wire, and to try to make clips with too stiff or too soft a wire is 
tantamount to trying to break Hooke's Law. Material economies can be 
realized in another way, however, and that is in the amount of wire used 
in each paper clip. Starting with a piece of wire just ten percent shorter 
that what the competition uses to fashion its Gems can translate into an 
advantage in the office products catalog, especially if saving pennies on 
every box of paper clips is more important than how the clips look to a 
supply manager who orders them by the millions. 
The classic Gem paper clip has certain proportions, as shown in Fig. 
2.8, which are principally manifested in the distance between the inner

Dimensions (in inches) of a classic Gem paper clip (left) and a recent

and outer loops and the length of the legs in which the wire terminates. 
The longer the inner loop, and thus the closer it is to the outer loop, the 
harder it is to attach a standard Gem, but the longer the loops and the 
legs, it has been generally believed by inventors, the better the gripping 
action of the clip. Like many a problem in engineering design, there is 
a tradeoff no matter what proportions are chosen, and the "best" solution 
is the one that balances ease of application with gripping power. The 
compromise might be further complicated if the designer wishes to choose 
balanced proportions that make the clip also aesthetically pleasing to 
the eye. 
The proportions of the Gem illustrated in Middlebrook's 1899 patent 
for his machine seem to have struck the happy medium that gave an all­
around successful paper clip. Like all artifacts, the Gem had its shortcom­
ings, but for almost a century its proportions remained unchanged. When 
old companies wanted to make a less expensive Gem or newer manufac­
turers wanted to break into the market, one of their most obvious strategies 
was to use less wire per clip, which necessitated making judgments about 
how to reshape the classic lines of the Gem. A proportionately smaller 
clip would be one solution, but the overall length of the clip would then 
I NVE NTION 
BY DE S I G N  
24 

change, and that would make the clip seem not quite comparable to the 
standard Gem. Alternatively, the loops could be moved further apart or 
the end legs could be shortened, or thinner wire could be used, or all of 
the above could be incorporated in a very inexpensive paper clip. Many 
of the newer manufacturers of "Gems" being sold today have taken this 
last course, making the clips look, feel, and behave differently. Each such 
alteration also leads to functional problems, of course, such as reduced 
gripping power, more easily deformed clips, and more easily torn papers. 
C H A N G E  A N D  C O M P E T I T I O N  
The box of "No. 1 Gem Clips" that I took most recently from our office 
supply cabinet displays a drawing of several Gems on the cover. These 
are classically proportioned, with close (but not too close) loops and long 
straight ends. The clips inside the box are different, however, as can easily 
be seen by placing one of them over the cover drawing. The actual clips, 
formed of less wire, have more distant loops and shorter legs. This gives 
a design that appears to be distinctly less well proportioned. In examining 
the box more carefully, I discovered that the clips are imported from an 
emerging industrialized country, and it is very possible that they were 
made on reclaimed old machinery that is not too dissimilar from Middle­
brook's but that has been adjusted to cut off a shorter piece of wire before 
forming it into an almost but not quite classically proportioned paper clip. 
Besides the poor proportions of the clips in this box, there is an amazing 
lack of uniformity from clip to clip, contrary to all the conventional 
wisdom about mass produced items. Although the side of the box reads 
"Finest Quality, Bright Finish, and Smooth Style," the contents proved 
to be a mixture of bright and dull finish clips, smooth and ridged designs, 
and, most strikingly, a collection of clips that looks almost hand-formed, 
with some so distinctly malformed that they could hardly be called paper 
clips. (In one box, I even found a straight pin, recalling the origins of the 
paper clip and the similarity of the roots of the manufacturing process.) 
Few of the clips lay flat, many are bent out of their plane and look almost 
pre-used. Clearly, there was little attempt to control the quality of what 
goes into the box. Since so few of the clips in the box are flat or have 
close-set legs, they tend to get tangled together and thus it is difficult to 
pick out one without several others dangling from it. This problem was 
described in some of the earliest patents for paper clips, and it was 
considered such a distinct disadvantage almost a century ago that many 
a new paper clip design argued for its superiority by claiming that the 
P A P E R  C L IPS A N D  D E S I G N  
2 5  

clips did not become interlocked in the box. Once the faults are pointed 
out, it is easy to see that the "new, improved" paper clips in the supply 
cabinet are in fact inferior to the old, established brands. So how did the 
new brand of paper clips end up in the supply cabinet? Why do manu­
facturers risk producing products inferior to what already exists? 
A book on "successful product design" provides some insight. Written 
by a former director of design in a manufacturing company and by a 
lecturer on technical management, the book outlines a concept of "total 
design," whereby technical issues of design and production are balanced 
by economic and marketing considerations. As an illustration of the 
system that the authors have devised, they present a detailed case study 
of the hypothetical British company, Omega Wire Forming, a large firm 
that had long prospered by supplying the automotive industry with springs 
and wire clips. With that industry depressed, however, Omega wished to 
broaden its product line so that it could move into new markets. The 
Board of Directors ordered the firm's design manager to form a group 
consisting of members of the market research, production, sales, and 
design departments and to look into what new product could be made 
utilizing the company's experience in wire forming. There were naturally 
guidelines on how much capital might be invested in new machinery and 
how much return on investment was expected, but otherwise the research 
group was unconstrained. 
Within two weeks, the group identified wire paper clips as a viable new 
product. The decision was justified in part by data showing that in recent 
years the price of paper clips had risen almost three times as fast as the 
price of wire, that demand for the product was up, and that there appeared 
to be little customer loyalty to any particular brand. According to the 
group's analysis, if Omega could manufacture paper clips at three for a 
penny, it might expect to capture 10 percent of the domestic market, 
which was estimated to be 500 million paper clips per year. Furthermore, 
if the price could be lowered to four for a penny, Omega might expect 
to sell 80 million paper clips domestically and export another 20 million 
each year. Among the main anticipated costs was that of distribution. 
Omega Wire Forming decided to get into the business of making paper 
clips, and the company's designers and engineers were instructed to focus 
their attention on improving the Gem paper clip and its method of 
manufacture. Since the standard-size Gem accounts for 90 percent of the 
market, its overall dimensions were believed to be fixed. However, if the 
legs could be cut off shorter, up to IO percent less total wire would be 
I N V E N T I O N  BY D E S I G N  
26 

needed for each paper clip, thus reducing the cost of raw materials, which 
represents over half the manufacturing cost. A lighter paper clip would 
result, which would also reflect savings in shipping costs. A test engi­
neer's determination that a paper clip with shorter legs resulted in only 
a 2 percent decrease in springiness or gripping strength clinched the 
decision. 
Finally, at virtually no additional manufacturing cost, the inner loop 
of the paper clip could be given a slight bend out of its plane, a competi­
tive feature that had recently begun to appear on most competing British 
paper clips, thus reviving a feature that the inventor McGill had intro­
duced almost a century earlier (see Fig. 2.6). Within a year of studying 
the problem, Omega Wire Forming was manufacturing modified Gem 
paper clips and was expecting to recover its investment costs in eighteen 
months. Thus are the economics of saving fractions of a penny on items 
that have potential sales in the hundreds of millions, if not billions 
worldwide. 
Whether the Far East manufacturers of the new paper clips found lately 
in our stationery catalogs and supply cabinets followed so structured a 
total design process as that of Omega Wire Forming, the imported clips 
do embody some very similar cost reduction features to give them an edge 
over more traditional domestic designs. It behooves those older manufac­
turers who do not wish to lose very much more of their accustomed market 
share to the newcomers on the shelf to look at the traditional designs with 
a critical eye to improving their usability and to educating paper clip users 
about the aesthetic, strength, and quality advantages that might be had 
for pennies more a box. The engineer, often acting as an inventor or 
designer, plays a central role in such considerations, whether the product 
be paper clips or computer chips. Indeed, the engineer is often the most 
severe critic of existing technology, and that is why things change over 
time. Curiously, however, where engineers find fault and see a need for 
improvement, others can sometimes find perfection. 
F O R M  A N D  F U N C T I O N  
The classic Gem paper clip is often held up by product designers as the 
epitome of modern manufactured articles. One design critic, praising 
elegant design solutions, has written: 
If all that survives of our fatally flawed civilization is the humble paper 
clip , archaeologists from some galaxy far, far away may give us more credit

A favorite pastime of some office workers is to doodle in 
wire by reshaping paper clips into all sorts of fanciful, and 
sometimes grotesque, new forms. 
Try your hand at deconstructing a Gem and designing a 
new paper clip. How is your design an improvement on the 
Gem? Does it have any less desirable qualities, such as 
reduced gripping power? Inventors often claim their im­
proved designs for paper clips have superior gripping power 
to that of the prior art. How could you determine in an 
objective way which of two paper clips has the greater 
gripping force under comparable conditions? 

than we deserve. In our vast catalog of material innovation, no more 
perfectly conceived object exists. To watch a Middle Eastern bank teller 
bind together bank notes with a straight pin (a practice dating back to early 
Roman times) is to comprehend the paper clip's amazing grace. 
And an architecture critic, marveling at "commonplace things of great 
design," clearly had the Gem in mind when he wrote : 
Could there possibly be anything better than a paper clip to do the job 
that a paper clip does? The common paper clip is light, inexpensive, 
strong, easy to use, and quite good-looking. There is a neatness of line to 
it that could not violate the ethos of any purist. One could not really 
improve on the paper clip, and the innumerable attempts to try-such as 
awkward, larger plastic clips in various colors, or paper clips with square 
instead of rounded ends - only underscore the quality of the real things. 
These excerpts are typical of the kind of praise heaped upon the Gem 
paper clip by those who look more at form than function. In their original 
context, such quotes are accompanied by illustrations of one or more 
Gems, but almost never clipping papers together. While the Gem may 
be a truly attractive and elegant object to look at when photographed in 
its own right, when applied as intended to a group of papers it takes on 
a less graceful appearance. The "bravura loop-within-a-loop design" is 
broken by the papers it is intended to hold, and the Gem can look 
curiously incomplete and misaligned, with its straight end not on target 
to meet the loop disappearing behind the sheets. When applied to more 
than a few sheets, the Gem can appear especially ungainly, twisted, and 
deformed. 
Engineers and inventors are not so easily pleased with the object in 
the abstract. While they are not averse to designing things that look 
attractive, that is not the only criterion for elegance and beauty, which 
can only be skin deep. How a thing functions is often where engineers 
begin their quest, and no object that fails to function properly can be 
considered truly beautiful or perfected. To a host of inventors, the perfect 
paper clip remains an unfulfilled quest, as the steady stream of patents for 
new, improved paper clips attests. Even as the one-hundredth anniversary 
of the Gem approached, patent applications continued to be filed for still 
more improvements on the Gem and other paper clip designs. 
Among the imperfect things about the Gem that many a recent inven­
tor has discovered or rediscovered when reflecting upon how the "per­
fected" paper clip is used to clip papers together are the following: 
P APE R C L I PS A N D  D E S I G N  
29 

I .  It goes on only one way. Half the time, the user has to tum the clip 
around before applying it. 
2. It does not ;ust slip on. The user has first to spread the loops apart. 
3. It does not always stay on. The clip gets snagged on papers or other 
objects and gets pulled off. 
4. It tears the papers. The sharp ends of the clip dig into the papers 
when it is removed. 
5. It does not hold many papers well. The clip either twists badly out 
of shape or flies off the pile. 
6. It bulks up stacks of paper. A lot of file space can be taken up by 
paper dips. 
When a new design removes one of these annoyances, it more likely 
than not fails to address some others or adds a new one of its own. This 
is what makes engineering and inventing so challenging. All design 
involves conflicting objectives and hence compromise, and the best de­
signs will always be those that come up with the best compromise. Finding 
a way to bend a piece of wire into a form that satisfies each and every 
objective of a paper clip is no easy task, but that does not mean that people 
do not try. 
A 
M O D E L  PAPER C L I P  PAT E N T  
Over the past century there have been several hundred patents issued 
specifically for bent wire paper clips, and each of them is a testament to 
its inventor's ability to find fault with existing paper clip designs, which 
more often than not are represented by the Gem. That the quest remains 
as challenging as ever can be demonstrated by looking at some paper clip 
patents from very recent years. 
U.S. Patent No. 4,949,435 was issued on August 21, 1990, to Gary K. 
Michelson, a surgeon and inventor of medical devices from Venice, 
California. The cover page is in the format that has been followed since 
the early 1970s, when the U.S. patent and trademark laws were revised 
(see Fig. 2.9). This new format shows various things at a glance, including 
the patent number, name of the patent, name of the inventor, application 
filing date, which is not untypically a year or more before the patent is 
granted, and the date of the formal issuance of the patent, which by 
tradition will be at noon on a Tuesday. (In most countries, patent rights 
go to the person who files first. In the United States, the law holds that 
patent rights belong to the person who first came up with the idea, and

this is why so many industrial and individual inventors scrupulously keep 
carefully dated notebooks of their ideas, experiments, and explorations.) 
Also on the cover page are lists of Patent Office categories known as classes 
and fields involving the so-called prior art, or existing relevant technology, 
against which the novelty of the improvement is judged by the patent 
examiner. Related patents, both U.S. and foreign, are פlso listed on the 
cover page, as are other (nonpatent) documents that might be relevant to 
the case. The cover sheet also shows the name of the patent examiner (a 
job that Albert Einstein held in Switzerland while he was formulating his 
theory of relativity) and the name of the inventor's patent attorney, agent, 
or firm. Finally, there is an abstract that briefly describes the invention, 
the number of claims (which appear on the last page of the patent and 
which spell out for what exactly the inventor has been granted a patent), 
and the number of drawing sheets (which can show the prior art as well 
as various views of the subject of the patent). 
Drawings are a very important component of the patent, and an appli­
cation can be delayed until drawings acceptable to the Patent Office are 
produced. The sheets of drawings follow the cover page, and in the case 
of Michelson's paper clip patent there are two sheets, or pages, of draw­
ings, showing the paper clip from various points of view, with its various 
parts numbered for reference in the text of the patent. The drawing 
appearing on the· cover page is one of those that appears on the inside 
sheets also. While patent drawings are very important in conveying the 
idea of the patent, these drawings do not always follow the best practices 
of engineering drafting, and so the device might not be easily understood 
from the patent drawings alone. 
The textual part of the patent document begins with background to 
the invention, and the opening paragraphs of Michelson's patent are 
especially explicit in criticizing the prior art. Even though some of the 
language might be a bit excessive, as it is wont to be in patent applications, 
there should be little doubt that he is talking about the Gem: 
32 
Paper clips are generally used as expendable items to either temporarily 
attach papers or as indexing markers. 
Use of the common paper clip presents a number of problems. In use, 
the two loops of the common paper clip must be digitally manipulated 
and manually spread so that papers can then be inserted between the loops. 
The common paper clip does not work well for any significant thickness 
of paper, being difficult to apply, and once applied is physically deformed, 
in the process, such that it cannot be reused without being deliberately 
I N V E N T I O N  BY 
D E S I G N  

and correctionally bent by the user. Further, when used with any sig­
nificant thickness of paper, the loops of the common paper clip torque on 
their long axises [sic] such that the clip will not lie Rat on the papers and 
will simultaneously protrude from the plane of the papers on either side. 
This also results in the sharp ends of the legs digging into the papers 
causing damage. More damage will usually occur during removal of the 
clip as the clip is dragged even deeper into the paper. 
Also, because the loops of the paper clip are being spread apart, there 
is a tendency for the common paper clip to try to close by forcefully 
ejecting off of a thick group of papers, thereby presenting a very real threat 
to the user, who may be struck in the eye. 
Michelson goes on in his patent with further criticism of the Gem 
when used as an indexing marker, such as it might be in marking the 
page of a book. The patent document then describes the new and im­
proved paper clip, and Michelson is especially explicit in showing point 
by point how his paper clip is, "despite its relative apparent simplicity, a 
technological advancement and is superior to the prior art" with regard 
to his categories of capacity, reusability, ease of application, ability to lie 
flat, ease of removal, indexing features, safety, economics, and mailability. 
The form of patents involves a lot of redundancy, and Michelson's 
patent is no exception. It goes on to state the object of the invention, 
which is essentially a rehashing of the description of the clip's advantages. 
Separate brief and detailed descriptions of the drawings follow, referring 
to the little numbers associated with the various parts of the device 
illustrated. Finally, the patent closes, as does every patent, with a legally­
crafted single long sentence, filling an entire paragraph, and prefaced 
by the phrase, "What is claimed is." It is this final section that is the 
ultimate focus of the patent examination, for it is what the applicant is 
allowed to claim or not for his or her invention that provides full protec­
tion or none. If none of the applicant's claims is allowed, then no patent 
can be issued. 
The single claim of Michelson's patent is about 200 words long, and 
it begins: 
What is claimed is: 
1 .  A paper clip comprising a single piece of bent wire having a straight 
top spine portion, two side leg portions bent substantially perpendicular 
to the top spine portion and two bent end portions bent substantially at 
a 45 degree angle to the side leg portions . . .

SOME MORE PAPER CLIP PATE N TS 
Another new paper clip was invented by Charles T. Link, of Carmichael, 
California, and on November 1 2, 1991, he received U.S. Patent No. 
5,063,640 for his "endless filament paper clip," as shown in Fig. 2.10. 
Link's principal focus was the lack of symmetry of common paper clips 
like the Gem. When we pick a Gem out of a box, we have to make sure 
it is turned the right way before attaching it to a group of papers. This 
failing is addressed by the endless filament clip, which can be applied 
from either of its ends. Rather than go into his patent in detail, however, 
it will be instructive to look at Link's inventive process. When he was 
asked how he came to invent his clip, Link wrote in a letter about three 
aspects of invention: 
1 .  Why did I want to invent the clip? . . . I had been convinced for many 
years, and others whom I talked to concurred, that people would wel­
come an improvement in paper clips that would enable one to engage 
papers in the same manner at both ends of the clip, and that would also 
eliminate scratching and tearing of the papers. The more I used paper 
clips the more convinced I became that these improvements should be 
made and that the effort might be financially rewarding. 
2. Why did I believe I could invent it? . . . My initial effort to sketch a 
likely concept frankly cooled my enthusiasm somewhat. . . .  After fur­
ther days of sketching and thinking, however, a rather vague concept 
began to materialize and gradually bring about a reasonable confidence 
in my mind that I could probably create a satisfactory configuration for 
a new clip having the desired improvements. 
3. How did I invent it? . . .  The third stage took place over a much longer 
period of time because it included not only sketches and drawings but 
also considerable experimenting with variously modified configurations 
of clips and with various means for forming them. This period also 
included a great amount of time and effort spent in collaborating with 
my patent attorney . . . to produce the best configuration, claims and 
drawings we could. 
Gaining a patent does not end an inventor's quest, however. Link has 
also written of the difficulties in locating a wire fabricating concern that 
could produce the clip. A special wire-forming machine may have had to 
be invented. In the meantime, Link made sample clips "by hand with the 
aid of a special wire bending fixture." The clips are very attractive and a 
pleasure to use, but whether they would ever be available in stationery

stores would depend upon how successfully made and marketed they 
could be in the minds of manufacturers and investors. Link has written 
reflectively of his design experience as follows: 
In retrospect, the visual aspect of the overall design problem seemed to be 
at least as difficult and frustrating as the original functional problem, partly 
because of the subtle nature of the former and partly because of the need 
to achieve visual compatibility with the billions of Gem clips in use. In 
addition, however, the visual aspect seemed to be sensitive to the passage 
of time which frequently resulted in an apparently excellent visual design 
change losing its appeal some time after being introduced. Then again, 
some visual design changes seemed to gain in appeal over time. Fortu­
nately, the visual and functional aspects of the entire clip design finally 
reached compatibility and stability over time. 
Another contemporary inventor, Billie E. Strong, of Midpines, Califor­
nia, also addressed the Gem's failure to be applied from either direction. 
U.S. Patent No. 5,170,535 was issued to Strong on December 1 5, 1992, 
for "time saving paper clips," as shown in Fig. 2. 1 1 . In the background 
to the invention, Strong criticizes the Gem as follows: 
In reviewing this standard form of paper clip, it will be noted that only 
one end of the clip can be utilized to clip pieces of paper together. As 
such, when a paper clip is removed by a worker for the purpose of clipping 
sheets of paper together, the worker must first determine the correct end 
of the clip and align it accordingly. This greatly increases the task of 
clipping sheets of paper together, both in time and effort, and accordingly, 
there exists a continuing need for new and improved paper clips which 
could be more easily aligned and utilized in performing this simple office 
function. 
Like virtually every inventor, Strong wants to respond to this "need," 
which admittedly may not be as readily perceived by the typical office 
worker, by providing "a new and improved paper clip which has all the 
advantages of the prior art paper clips and none of the disadvantages." 
The new clip has the added advantage that it can hold a label and so also 
serve as a filing aid. 
Still another inventor, Suzy Chung Hirzel, found fault with large 
plastic paper clips because they could not hold thick piles of paper, and 
she was issued U.S. Patent No. 5,010,629 on April 30, 1991, for her "paper 
clip with vertical panel," as shown in Fig. 2.12. According to this inventor, 
who markets a variety of her own products under the name Suzy Chung

Pate nt fo r  a large-capacity plastic paper clip, issued to Suzy Chung Hirzel 
I N V E N T I O N  BY 
D E S I G N

or simply Suzy C, the larger plastic paper clips she found in stores were 
"very flimsy and would slip off'' the thick packages of material she wished 
to clip together. Metal binder clips were the standard alternative, but she 
had had "several bad experiences with being pinched and cut," and so 
she avoided those types of clips. She therefore set out to design a new clip 
that not only holds thick piles of assorted papers but also can keep them 
separated in layers. The development of the clip went through various 
stages to get the right spring and stiffness to the injection-molded parts, 
but now that she has perfected it, Suzy Chung is marketing her Layer 
Clip in various colors and sizes. She holds several other patents, including 
ones for a chestnut cutter, a hair curling device, and a shovel for weeding, 
and she uses her Layer Clip to distribute marketing information for all of 
her products. 
An even more recent patent for a paper clip (Fig. 2. 13) was issued on 
July 19, 1994, more than nine years after the application was first filed, 
to Linda A. Froehlich and Richard D. Froehlich, who own and operate 
the Ace Wire Spring and Form Company near Pittsburgh. The paper clip 
patented by the Froehlichs also addresses the problem of clipping large 
quantities of paper together, and hence the clip they began manufacturing 
was about three times the size of a standard No. 1 Gem. At first glance, 
the larger clip might look like just an enlarged Gem, and this may explain 
why the Froehlichs had to take their case all the way to the Patent Office's 
appeals board before receiving their patent. In fact, the new clip is not 
only larger but has much longer end legs than the standard Gem. While 
George McGill's 1903 patent also had this feature, the Froehlichs' is 
further distinguished by the nature of the wire from which it is made. 
Most clips are made of standard steel wire, but the patent for the new clip 
discloses how a better quality of spring wire can be used to give the clip 
the ability to hold large amounts of paper securely and yet spring back to 
its original shape when removed. 
The larger amount of better quality wire obviously makes this new clip 
more expensive to manufacture and thus more expensive to buy, but its 
advantages over existing large-capacity clips is expected to overcome this 
disadvantage. Patent drawings (Fig. 2. 14) show how the long legs do not 
dig into the paper the way those of standard clips do, and the Froehlichs 
believe their four-inch-long clips are also superior in other ways. Accord­

Who has not experienced the frustration of the lead of a pencil point 
repeatedly breaking? It appears to happen especially easily in thin-lead 
mechanical pencils, where more lead seems to end up in the wastebasket 
than is used up in writing, and at times the inconvenience of the con­
stantly breaking lead seems to negate the advantages of not having to 
sharpen those familiar 0.5-mm thin-lead pencils. But rather than just com­
plain or ignore this little annoyance of everyday life, let us look more closely 
at pencil points to see why they break and what they can teach us about 
materials and their strength and about how engineers analyze problems. 
If a pencil point is pushed hard against a writing surface, it in turn 
pushes equally hard back (according to the principle of action and reac­
tion of forces, which Newton articulated as his Third Law). When the 
push is more than the material of the pencil point can withstand, the 
pencil point breaks. To understand this phenomenon in more detail, we 
can look more closely at the lead protruding from the end of a mechanical 
pencil. 
CANTILEVER 
BEAMS 
A pencil is a structure, because it is an assemblage of materials designed 
to sustain loads. More specifically, a pencil used in writing or drawing can 
be described as a cantilever beam, which is simply a structure supported 
at one end only. Trees blown by the wind, airplane wings with attached 
engines, and apartment house balconies holding partygoers are other 
common structures that may be described as cantilever beams. The most 
important part of a pencil cantilevered from the hand holding it is clearly 
the pencil point, which the writing surface pushes against as the pencil 
is used. 
Because we recognize that the metal and plastic parts of a mechanical 
pencil are so much stiffer and stronger than the small piece of lead

Galileo's illustration of a cantilever beam 
projecting out from the end of the metal sleeve, we can imagine that the 
pencil proper is for all practical purposes an extension of the hand, with 
the exposed lead itself comprising the cantilever beam. The juncture 
between the projecting lead and the pencil proper may be considered the 
root of the beam. Even though the pencil is really at an angle to the paper, 
and even though the push of the paper is really at an angle to the 
pencil-beam, there are enough similarities between pencil points, trees, 
wings, and balconies for engineers to see them as analogous. Thus, 
understanding the behavior of any one of these examples gives us more 
insight into beams generally.

Thin-line polymer lead in a bending test, demonstrating its flexibility 
Figure 3 . 1  shows a cantilever beam as illustrated in Galileo's important 
book, Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences, published in 1638. One 
of the two new sciences of the title is today known as strength of materials, 
among the first courses engineering students take after calculus and 
physics. It was Galileo's investigations into the behavior of the cantilever 
beam that laid the foundations for this course, and while much of what 
he wrote has been superseded, his general approach to the problem 
remains a model of sound engineering science. What motivated Galileo 
to look so closely at the cantilever beam was the inexplicable breaking of 
wooden ships, marble columns, and other products of Renaissance engi­
neering. Broken pencil points can do the same today. 
While such diverse structures as ships and pencil leads might not seem 
at first to be related to each other, let alone to cantilever beams, they are. 
Figure 3.2, for example, shows a piece of polymer-based pencil lead being 
tested for its strength and flexibility. In this case, the pencil lead is 
supported at both its ends, and the load is being applied at the center.

Demonstration that a simply supported beam (bottom) may be thought of 
as the mirror image of two back-to-back cantilever beams 
This is not unlike the situation in which a ship with a heavy load in its 
center hold might be found when its bow and stem are raised on high 
waves. In such an arrangement the ship or lead is considered to be a 
simply supported beam, but it in tum can also be considered two canti­
lever beams, as Fig. 3.3 demonstrates. Across the central vertical plane of 
symmetry, each half of the beam can be considered a wall into which the 
root of the other half is embedded. The support loads can then be viewed 
as forces or weights which bend each of the cantilever beams. Because 
each of the halves is the mirror image of the other, analyzing either one 
is sufficient for approaching the entire problem. Such different points of 
view are often helpful in analyzing new engineering problems in terms 
of older, familiar ones, about which something is already known. 
Galileo saw a cantilever beam as a bent (or canted) lever, with its 
fulcrum at the point labeled B in Fig. 3.1. He imagined that the effect of 
the boulder hanging from the end of the beam was to produce a tendency 
to tum the lever about point B, but that such motion was resisted by a 
uniform force of cohesion across the entire section AB, as shown in Fig. 
3.4a. By balancing these opposing effects, Galileo could relate the capacity 
of the beam to support a weight to the size of the beam's cross section 
and the strength of the material of which it was made. The conclusions

F I G  u R E  3.4 Assumptions about the distribution of cohesive forces in a cantilever beam 
by: (a) Galileo, (b) Mariotte, and (c) Parent 
Galileo reached made sense to him at the time, but they overestimated 
the capacity of the beam by a factor of three. 
Galileo's assumption that the resisting force was uniformly distributed 
across the entire section AB did not allow for the fact that timber, like all 
materials, has a degree of elasticity, and its force of resistance would be 
proportional to the stretch of the beam, which should increase with 
increasing distance from the pivot point. Such a realization led sub­
sequent analysts, such as the Frenchman Edme Mariotte, to modify the 
distribution of resisting force to the triangular form shown in Fig. 3.4b, 
and this gave a more accurate result. However, this was still an incorrect 
analysis of the forces keeping the beam in equilibrium, because neither 
assumption provides a force to balance the net horizontal force across the 
section AB. In time, still other analysts, such as Mariotte's compatriot A. 
P E N C I L  P O I N T S

Parent, realized that the true action of the forces acting across section AB 
of the beam is as shown in Fig. 3.4c, with the bottom being pushed into 
the wall and the top being pulled out. There are also additional forces 
acting on the beam, and their careful and systematic analysis is the subject 
of study in the engineering science courses known as statics and strength 
of materials.

In Fig. 3.5 only the germane part of a mechanical pencil point is shown, 
with the force acting vertically upward, as it would on a very slick writing 
surface (one with virtually no friction between the pencil and paper) or 
a piece of glass. We can imagine that this force has two components, 
which give two different effects. One component, which is along the axis 
of the pencil lead, wants to push the lead back into the pencil's sleeve, as 
it does when we release the gripping mechanism to retract the lead. We 
also experience the effects of such a force when the lead inside has gotten 
so small that it does not reach back to the gripping device. (In this case, 
we propel the last half-inch or so of lead out of the pencil, discard it, and 
maneuver a fresh long piece of lead in place to resume writing, thus 
demonstrating one definite shortcoming of mechanical pencils that cries 
out for improvement.) The other component of the push of the paper on 
the lead acts perpendicular to the axis of the lead and wants to bend the 
lead (as in Fig. 3.2), and when this bending is more than the material of 
the lead can take, the point breaks off. (It is easy to see how bending 
breaks the lead by experimenting with a long piece of lead before it is 
inserted into the pencil. If you prefer not to use pencil lead, pieces of dry 
thin spaghetti or vermicelli will also demonstrate the phenomenon under 
discussion.) 
Since the part of the paper's push that drives the lead back into the 
pencil does not appreciably affect the bending action, we can ignore it 
when looking into the breaking of the lead. In this case, the only relevant 
action on the end of the pencil point is one that is perpendicular to the 
shaft of lead. Furthermore, whether this is imagined as a push from one 
side or a pull from the other makes little difference, for both actions bend 
the lead equally. Hence, we can represent the pencil-lead cantilever beam 
simply as shown in Fig. 3.6a, which makes it completely analogous to 
Galileo's problem of the beam projecting from a wall and supporting a 
heavy boulder at its end.

Idealization and decomposition of forces acting on a mechanical pencil 
point 
Just as Galileo observed that a cantilever beam (without any notches, 
knots, nicks, or other anomalies that complicate the problem) will break 
at the wall, so we can observe that the lead comprising a mechanical 
pencil point (without any nicks, bad spots, or other anomalies) will invari­
ably break at the juncture with the metal or plastic sleeve. To see that the 
parenthetical caveats are not just theoretical diversions, use a pocket knife 
or scissor blade to saw part way through a piece of lead and propel the 
lead so that the nick is located some distance from the metal sleeve. With 
the nick facing downward, as shown in Fig. 3.6b, press the pencil point 
onto a writing surface until the lead breaks. If the nick is deep enough, 
the lead will break at the nick and not at the juncture with the sleeve. 
With no nick, the mechanical pencil lead breaks at the sleeve, just as 
Galileo's beam breaks at the wall, because that is where the intensity of 
force, which grows larger toward the root of the beam, first exceeds the 
strength of the material. The lead-beam can break at some distance from 
the wall if a nick or notch raises the intensity of force the beam must carry 
at that location over what its strength is there. Clearly, the presence of

Further idealization of force on a mechanical pencil point comprising: (a) 
perfect lead, and (b) notched or nicked lead 
the nick changes the behavior of the pencil-lead beam as readily as a saw 
cut could the behavior of Galileo's beam or the limb of a tree. Such details 
complicate engineering analysis, but do not make it impossible. 
Thin-lead mechanical pencils followed the development of polymer­
based leads, which are very flexible (that is, capable of sustaining a fair 
amount of bending, as shown in Fig. 3.2) and, in spite of how easily these 
leads seem to break under writing conditions, are relatively strong for their 
size. Before the pencils holding such leads became so popular, the stand-
I N V E N T I O N  BY 
D E S I G N

ard mechanical pencil lead was a ceramic rod (made principally of 
graphite and clay) over a millimeter in diameter, which made it relatively 
thick and thus not capable of drawing so fine a line as the newer plastic 
leads. Ceramic pencil leads had to have larger diameters because they 
were so brittle and would break too easily if thinner. 
There are clearly two competing objectives in pencil making: ( 1) to 
make the lead as thin as possible, so that as fine a line as desired can be 
drawn, and (2) to make the lead thick enough to give it sufficient strength. 
In pencil making as in most engineering endeavors, in addition to often 
conflicting goals there are always additional objectives which further 
complicate the problem. A pencil must be of a comfortable size, so that 
it can be used for writing over an extended period of time. To make a 
pencil lead itself (with no case) so thick as to be comfortable in the hand 
defeats the objective of achieving a relatively fine line, and also, since the 
writing substance is the single most expensive ingredient in the pencil, a 
comfortably thick lead would be wasteful because so much of it would 
be lost in sharpening. Furthermore, the very graphite in pencil lead (a 
misnomer) that makes it write also dirties the hand that holds it, and so 
an unprotected piece of lead is not very desirable anyway. For these 
reasons and more, the wood-cased pencil evolved shortly after the discov­
ery of graphite. 
W O O D • C A S E D  P E N C I LS 
A wood-cased pencil sharpened to a conical point presents a more com­
plicated problem in analysis than does a mechanical pencil because of 
the more complex geometry and the interaction between the wood and 
the lead. Up until the 1930s the points on wood-cased pencils generally 
broke in a rather messy way: The lead most often snapped inside the 
wooden shaft and splintered the wood back in the process. This mode of 
behavior was likely to occur for two main reasons: ( 1) If the pencil 
happened to be badly warped or dropped on a hard surface, the lead inside 
the wooden case became broken into several short pieces, which in effect 
meant that the pencil point was not so deeply embedded in the wood and 
so was a poorly supported cantilever beam. (2) When the pencil point was 
sharpened, the wood was necessarily thinned in the very place where its 
strength was needed to support the projecting lead. In both cases, the 
action of the pencil point as a cantilever beam was compromised at 
the critical location-which is analogous to stones being removed from 
the wall above Galileo's beam. If only a few wall stones remained above 
P E N C I L  P O I N T S  A N D  A N A L Y S I S  
5 1  

the beam support, they could easily be displaced by the lever action of the 
beam, which would then collapse. Similarly, the thin sheath of wood near 
the sharpened pencil point can provide little support to the lead, especially 
if there is a poor bonding betWeen the lead and wood. 
Such undesirable features of wooden pencils were the focus of study 
and analysis by engineers in the 1930s, and understanding the shortcom­
ings was the goal of engineering efforts that started with measurements to 
determine the comparative strengths of competing pencil brands. Thus, 
when the Eagle Pencil Company wanted to advertise its Mikado pencils 
as stronger than those of the opposition, pencil points were broken under 
controlled conditions. As it turned out, the Eagle pencils were not so 
significantly stronger that the company could support the desired adver­
tising claims. Hence, engineers were asked to see if they could make Eagle 
pencils stronger. Just as Galileo did three centuries earlier for timber 
beams and marble columns, the twentieth-century engineers began by 
looking more closely at exactly how pencils did break, and analyzing the 
phenomena involved. They soon realized that the problem lay principally 
in the fact that the wood did not act adequately in concert with the lead 
to help prevent its breaking prematurely in the case or its tearing through 
the hollow cone of wood from which the sharpened lead projected. 
Understanding this weakness of the lead-wood composite beam enabled 
the engineers to focus on how to strengthen it. In general, it is the analysis 
of failures or of limitations of a design that leads to improved under­
standing and thus to improved products. 
Wood-cased pencils were made by gluing rods of pencil lead into 
grooved wood slats and then gluing on a mating piece of wood, as shown 
in Fig. 3.7. When the glue was dry, the pencils were shaped, finished, 
packaged, and shipped from the factory. Unfortunately, the glue did not 
always form a very good bond between the lead and the wood, for various 
reasons. Among these were that both the lead and the wood were impreg­
nated with wax-the lead to make it write more smoothly and the wood 
to make it easier to sharpen. The presence of the wax prevented the glue 
from adhering as well as it might, and as a result the lead and wood did 
not bond tightly together. (It is possible to find older pencils that look 
perfectly fine but in which the wood and lead are completely unattached, 
and the lead can be slid freely back and forth inside the wooden shaft.) 
When a poorly bonded pencil was dropped, the lead could easily break 
into many smaller pieces inside the wood case, often to be discovered 
only when the pencil was sharpened. A common frustration was to have

the point drop out as soon as pencil was put near paper. Even if the pencil 
lead was intact inside the wood case, excessive writing pressure could 
create a high intensity of force where the sharpened wood case was not 
strong enough to resist it (what pencil manufacturers referred to as the 
"pressure point"), and the wood on the top of the pencil would split open 
and the exposed lead break. It was as if the wall supporting Galileo's beam 
were made of loosely held stones that were pried up by the cantilever. 
Engineers learn a lot by studying how things break and fail, and the 
troubleshooting and research into the problem of fragile pencil points by 
engineers at the Eagle Pencil Company led to this understanding of how 
and why pencil points were breaking the way they were. Once the causes 
were understood, further research led to measures that could be taken to 
lessen the occurrence of failure in wood-cased pencil leads. Since the 
presence of wax was responsible for the inability of the glue to form a 
secure bond, means were sought for negating the effects of the wax. These 
problems did not fall neatly into purely chemical or purely mechanical 
engineering categories, but such cross-disciplinary research is common to 
much of the work of the engineer and is what makes the pursuit of 
solutions to problems always fresh and challenging. 
After some experimenting, it was found that bathing unsheathed lead 
in sulfuric acid burned off the wax from the surface, and a subsequent 
bathing in calcium chloride coated the lead with a sealing film of gyp­
sum. The wood in turn was impregnated with a resinous binder, which 
made the wood fibers tough and less easily split. In combination, these 
treatments of the components of the pencil prepared them for glue that 
held as never before. The Eagle Pencil Company termed its process 
"Chemi-Sealed," and other manufacturers soon countered with their own 
improved ways of making pencils, labeling them "Bonded," "Wood­
clinched," "Pressure Proofed," and the like. Advertising departments lost 
no time in bringing the advantages of the new pencils to the attention of 
consumers. The trademarked terms describing how pencil leads were 
more fully supported by the wood casing still appear on pencils today, and 
they are indications that the cantilever beam of lead is held as securely 
in the pencil shaft as Galileo's beam was assumed to be held in the 
masonry wall.

The points of the improved pencils did not break in the same way, of 
course, but that is not to say they did not break. Which of us has not

experienced the frustration of sharpening a pencil to a fine point just to 
have it snap off as soon as we touch it to paper? Such experiences teach 
us to press more lightly on a newly sharpened pencil, but we can easily 
forget in the midst of writing something that absorbs all of our mental 
energies, and we can thus find our pencil points breaking with annoying 
frequency. If we are really absorbed in our writing task, we will almost 
unthinkingly resharpen our pencil, pick up a fresh one, or continue to 
write with the increasingly blunting (and actually strengthening) pencil 
in our hand. 
Don Cronquist, a California engineer, did just such things while 
preparing a long hand-written rough draft of a report that he was working 
on in the mid-1970s. We can imagine that his desk was piled high with 
books, papers, notes, and so forth, much as ours would be after working 
on an important term paper, laboratory report, or speech. Whether or not 
we would clear our desk before going on to another project, Cronquist 
proceeded to clear his and "became mystified" when he "discovered a 
very large number of broken-off pencil points (BOPPs) lying between and 
behind the books and other reference materials" on his desk. It was not 
the large number of pencil points that was remarkable, for he knew how 
easily they broke off newly sharpened pencils. Rather, according to Cron­
quist, "the mysterious thing about the collection of BOPP's was that they 
were almost all nearly identical in size and shape." 
An observation like Cronquist's, that all the BOPPs looked similar, 
suggests to an engineer or scientist that there is an engineering or scientific 
explanation for how the pencil points broke the way they did. The BOPPs 
lying about the desk were literally data points from an experiment, albeit 
an unplanned one, and their falling into the strong pattern of similarity 
that Cronquist noticed presented too neat a problem in analysis to pass 
up. Just as scientists seek to understand the behavior of the given natural 
world, whether it be the growth of plants or the motion of planets, so 
engineers seek to understand the behavior of objects crafted, fabricated, 
or manufactured by humans. Such objects are known as artifacts, and 
when their nature and behavior are the subject of study by engineers, the 
engineers are said to be engaged in analysis or engineering science. 
Galileo laid the foundations of engineering science when he attacked the 
problem of the cantilever beam the way he did. 
Since Cronquist saw no obvious explanation for the size and shape of 
BOPPs in the geometry of how his pencils were sharpened or in the 
material of the pencil lead itself, he did what Galileo did three centuries

earlier-Cronquist proceeded to attack the problem with an analysis that 
combined geometrical and strength considerations. Expecting that the 
intensity of force (known as stress) in a tapered cantilever beam (the pencil 
point) depended upon distance Jrom the load or force, Cronquist argued 
that a pencil point would break at the location where the stress in the lead 
reached a limiting value, which is the breaking strength of the material. 
He assumed that this strength (or ability to resist stress) was the same 
everywhere in the pencil lead, because his were good quality pencils that 
he could assume were made of good raw materials and manufactured to 
tight standards. He further assumed that the geometry of the pencil point 
was a regular truncated cone, so that he could apply mathematics no more 
complicated than geometry, algebra, and calculus and carry out calcula­
tions with pencil and paper alone. The advantages of this approach over 
resorting right away to a computer model of the problem are that one can 
solve once and for all the general problem explicitly and get answers in 
terms of significant parameters. A computer program could then be used 
to advantage to explore myriad different configurations of pencil point 
angle, writing angle, and so forth. (The disadvantage of using a computer 
initially and directly for such a problem, and for much more complicated 
problems also, is that only one specific combination of geometry, loading 
condition, and material strength can be considered at a time. An under­
standing of general principles comes only if one can infer them from the 
collection of separate solutions.) 
The principal complicating factor in Cronquist's analysis of the pencil 
point is that it is tapered rather than cylindrical. This means, of course, 
that there is not a constant area to resist the load over which the breaking 
force is distributed. Since Galileo's beam has constant area throughout, 
it is a simple matter to conclude, as Galileo did, that breaking will occur 
where the intensity of breaking force is greatest, which by the principle 
of the lever is clearly at the wall. In the case of the tapered beam of the 
pencil point, the area increases with the diameter squared, and so there 
is no obvious breaking location. A general analysis must be carried out to 
calculate where the intensity of load first exceeds strength. 
Cronquist began his analysis by modeling the pencil point as a canti­
lever beam with a tapered circular cross section and assuming that the 
force of the paper on the pencil is perpendicular to its axis, as shown in 
Fig. 3.8. (While this assumption about the force is not likely to be realistic 
in most writing situations, it is a reasonable one with which to begin an 
engineering analysis because, just as with the mechanical pencil point, it

F I G U R E  3.8 Engineer Don Cronquist's idealization of a wood-cased pencil point as a 
cantilever beam 
is most likely the component of the force perpendicular to the pencil axis 
that has the most influence on bending the point until the strength of 
the lead is reached and a broken-off pencil point results. This can be 
verified with a piece of chalk by comparing how much more easily it is 
broken by a push perpendicular· to the axis of the chalk as opposed to a 
push or pull directed along the length of the stick of chalk.) Once he 
had defined the assumptions about the applied force and geometry of 
the problem with the aid of a diagram similar to the one in Fig. 3.8, 
Cronquist was able to begin his more mathematical analysis. Develop­
ments since Galileo's time have made the problem of calculating the 
bending stresses in a cantilever something that second-year engineer­
ing students are expected to master. After some calculation, Cronquist 
did indeed find his equations to predict that the pencil point should break 
at some intermediate location between the writing tip and the junc­
ture with the wood case. Cronquist had a degree of confidence in his 
results in that they correctly predicted that sharper pencil points break 
more easily than blunt ones, which was consistent with his experi­
ence. Furthermore, the size of the BOPP that his equations predicted 
matched very closely the size of the BOPPs he had found on his writ­
ing desk.

A CLOSER LOOK AT 
BOPPS 
Jearl Walker, in his "Amateur Scientist" column in Scientific American, 
reported on Cronquist's study and presented further experimental evi­
dence that his simple analysis was sound. However, like Cronquist, Walker 
could not provide a satisfactory explanation as to whr the BOPPs had 
fracture surfaces that were distinctly slanted back toward the pencil body. 
Rather than breaking across planes perpendicular to the edge of the pencil 
point the way a piece of chalk tends to, all the BOPPs had clearly formed 
by breaking off at a slight angle, as illustrated in Fig. 3.9. The consistency 
of this angle suggested that there should be some definite geometri­
cal and/or strength-of-materials explanation for the phenomenon, but the 
fact that neither Cronquist nor those who scrutinized his experimental 
data and analysis could come up with a satisfactory explanation left not a 
small measure of mystery associated with what had seemed to be a 
relatively simple problem in analysis with a rather straightforward analyti­
cal solution. (Some readers of Walker's column in Scientific American 
subsequently offered an explanation of the phenomenon, which involved 
taking into account forces oriented across the width of the pencil lead as 
well as along its length. Such additional forces, known as shear forces, are 
among the complications that engineering students learn to analyze in a 
strength of materials course.) 
Cronquist was not able to explain the slanted fracture surface on his 
BOPPs for reasons analogous to those that kept Galileo from catching an 
error in his seminal analysis of the cantilever beam. Both Galileo and 
Cronquist made some elementary assumptions at the outset about how 
their beams would break under certain realistic but simplified forces, and 
they proceeded to interpret their subsequent analysis in the context of 
their assumptions, continuing to take as a given what they had assumed 
at the outset. Galileo not only assumed that the cantilever beam would 
fail at the wall, which is correct, but that the breaking force would be 
uniformly distributed across the plane that would fracture, which is incor­
rect. Cronquist (with three centuries of inherited experience) did not 
assume so much. He allowed the force in the pencil lead to vary across 
the planes perpendicular to the axis as well as in intensity along the axis 
of the pencil-beam, but he ignored any effect of other forces when he 
assumed that fracture would occur where the maximum intensity of the 
axial force reached the strength of the pencil lead. Galileo had checked 
his own result by noting that it correctly predicted that a deep beam was

F I G U R E  3.9 Adaptation of Cronquist's drawing demonstrating details of how a pencil 
point breaks at an angle to the pencil axis 
stronger than a shallow one, and this gave him confidence that he had 
done his analysis correctly, even though it was no conclusive proof of 
correctness. Over three centuries later, Cronquist checked his result 
against the BOPPs that had prompted his analytical investigations, and 
when the predictions of his result and their dimensions agreed, he took 
that as confirmation of his starting hypothesis, even though he could not 
explain totally the slanted fracture surface. It would take subsequent and 
fresh analyses of the pencil point problem to find the error. 
While our engineering, science, and technology have clearly advanced 
a great deal over the centuries, the method of how we analyze and attack 
problems remains essentially unchanged since Galileo's work. Even when 
we use the most sophisticated computer models available, the same errors

of omission can be made. However, the clear and open statement of 
assumptions, calculations, and conclusions like those that Galileo intro­
duced enables subsequent engineers and scientists attacking the same and 
similar problems to check and build upon the work of their predecessors 
and thereby advance the state of knowledge and the state of the art. Isaac 
Newton likened this cumulative effect of being able t<,> see further than 
one's predecessors to standing on the shoulders of giants. 
F U R T H E R  A N A LY S I S  
As the case of BOPPs makes clear, it is the nagging unanswered questions 
that so often drive engineers and scientists to look further at problems. 
Not only did Cronquist's analysis leave open the question of why the 
fracture proceeded across a slanted surface, but his analysis was also 
limited to the case of a certain kind of force exerted by the writing surface. 
It may have been simply the desire to carry out a more general analysis 
(allowing for a rougher writing surface, for a variety of pencil sharpener 
angles, and for different angles at which the pencil was held to the paper) 
that drove Stephen Cowin, another engineering scientist, to attack the 
BOPP problem anew in the early 1980s. By allowing for a more general 
force on the pencil point, an arbitrary angle of sharpening, and a variable 
inclination of pencil to paper (as suggested in Fig. 3.10), he was able to 
explore how the size and shape of BOPPs might vary for different pencils 
under varying writing conditions. And perhaps he thought that the more 
general assumptions under which his analysis was carried out would 
provide insight into why the slanted surface occurred. 
As it turned out, for all of his generalizing the geometry and loading 
conditions of the problem, Cowin did not question the more fundamental 
assumption of the criterion for fracture, and he also assumed that failure 
would occur where the greatest value of axial stress reached the tensile 
strength of the material and also tacitly assumed that, once started, the 
fracture would proceed in a straight path across the pencil point. Thus, 
like Cronquist, Cowin essentially assumed that fracture would result in a 
BOPP that was a regular or a negligibly skewed cone rather than the 
distinctly skewed one that actually results when a pencil point breaks. 
In summary, neither Cronquist nor Cowin could fully explain why the 
fracture of pencil points occurs across a distinctly skewed plane because 
they based their entire analysis on the assumption that fracture occurred 
when the maximum tensile stress reached a critical value across a particu­
lar plane and they ignored altogether any shear forces or stresses that might

act parallel to that plane and serve to divert the propagating fracture from 
its initial path. The fact that early attempts at solving a problem like the 
broken pencil point failed in no way diminishes the contributions of 
analysts like Cronquist or Cowin in advancing our knowledge and ability 
to attack the problem anew and with the clear advantages of the founda­
tions they laid. Indeed, the work of such analysts in defining the problem 
and setting down their approaches to its solution guide and benefit all 
subsequent analysts, just as Galileo's fundamental but incomplete work 
on the cantilever beam in his Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences 
P E N C I L  P O I N T S  A N D  A N A L Y S I S  
61 

laid the foundation for all modern calculations in problems relating to 
the strength of materials. 
When calculations proceed from assumptions to predict something so 
accurately as the relative strength of cantilever beams or the absolute size 
of BOPPs, it also becomes increasingly unlikely that the validity or com­
pleteness of the fundamental assumptions are questioned. But just be­
cause those assumptions were not invalidated by results, it does not follow 
that the assumptions were complete or even correct. What determines the 
location and initial orientation of the fracture surface is indeed the 
greatest stress that the brittle pencil lead can withstand. In fact, while it 
is the plane across which the absolutely greatest tensile stress acts that 
determines where and how the fracture of the BOPP begins, as the 
fracture proceeds, the shear component of stress can play an increasing 
role in determining the plane across which the final separation of the 
point occurs, as was discussed in the Scientific American column that 
followed up on the original treatment of the problem. 
In the geometry of Galileo's beam and in the rectangular geometry of 
most cantilevers, the greatest intensity of force pulling the material apart 
(the maximum tensile stress) does act parallel to the long axis of the beam 
at its outer fibers. However, the conical geometry of a pencil point com­
plicates the problem, and ignoring even so seemingly small a detail limits 
the efficacy of all subsequent analysis. Whenever there is a boundary 
surface that has no force applied directly to it, like the sides of a pencil 
point, then the maximum tensile stress must always act across a plane that 
is perpendicular to the free surface. In the case of the pencil point, this 
observation leads immediately to an explanation as to why the BOPPs 
begin to break off at a slant; and a reconsideration of the basic assumption 
of the nature of the forces involved, including the consideration of shear, 
leads to a clarification of how the fracture proceeds. 
A N A L Y Z I N G  A N A L Y S I S  
The problem of BOPPs illustrates how important it is to keep in mind 
and to go back to fundamental assumptions in scrutinizing and interpret­
ing the results of engineering analysis. As long as one does not question 
the validity or recognize the restrictiveness of basic assumptions, one can 
overlook the fact that they are limiting one's interpretation of results. As 
relatively simple and inconsequential as the problem of BOPPs may 
appear to be, such a lesson is invaluable for developing a keen critical 
sense of engineering method and judgment. Analysis carried out with the 
I N V E N T I O N  B Y  D E S I G N  
62 

aid of the most complex of computer models is no less subject to such 
myopia. Indeed, the more complex the problem and its analysis, the more 
readily we can fall into the trap of focusing so intently and narrowly on 
the results of the analysis that we forget the fundamental assumptions 
upon which the analysis was based. Furthermore, as such analysis evolves 
to deal with increasingly more general or larger systems, whether they be 
BOPPs or suspension bridges, the more danger there is of losing sight of 
how restricted by fundamental assumptions the analysis of the model 
really is. 
Everyone makes mistakes, even geniuses like Galileo. Engineers must 
always be alert for what they may be oversimplifying and overlooking or 
to what conclusions they may be jumping. Because errors in engineering 
can have disastrous consequences, it is especially important for engineers 
to be reflective and alert in their design and analysis. One way of being 
better prepared for catching one's own errors is to be familiar with the 
kinds of mistakes that have been made by others, whether three centuries 
ago or yesterday. We can gain further insight into the kinds of pitfalls there 
are in engineering design and analysis by understanding the similarities 
in the way in which even someone so brilliant as Galileo could be misled 
by his oversimplified analysis of the cantilever beam, in which he ignored 
variations in the resisting force, and the ways in which we can overlook 
critical details in the analysis of such things as the fracture of pencil points. 
Even actual destructive experiments might not have uncovered 
Galileo's error easily because real materials and structures seldom occur 
in conditions as pure as mathematics. Real materials have variations and 
imperfections that make strength meaningful only in some statistical 
sense. If we break several objects, ostensibly identical, we are likely to get 
a range of strengths because the specimens will have varying kinds of 
imperfections (knots, cracks, splits, voids), and the experiments themselves 
will suffer from imperfect measurement, lack of alignment, and so forth. 
Furthermore, even if the results were scattered about a different value 
than that predicted, the difference might be attributed to something like 
an inability to get a true cantilever support rather than the real cause. (In 
Galileo's case, his overlooking entirely the springiness of the material 
obviously prevented him later from incorporating its important effects into 
his analysis.) 
Because engineers know that theoretical calculations and predictions 
can seldom capture all the variability and detail that exists in reality, they 
are not expected to be perfect. The way engineers have long used design

Graphical representations of a pencil - a  most familiar ob­
ject rich in symbolism and significance - are commonly 
found in newspaper cartoons and advertisements, especially 
at back-to-school time. Perhaps because these depictions are 
so common, we tend not to look very carefully at them or 
to note how often they represent objects impossible to find 
in real life. 
Among the most common errors is the portrayal of how 
a pencil is sharpened. In reality, the ridges of a hexagonal 
pencil are cut away by a pencil sharpÙner or knife. Why is 
it that sharpened pencils are so frequently drawn with the 
ridges intact? Does artistic license account for this phe­
nomenon, or is there some other explanation? 

formulas derived from analysis is to apply them conservatively in order to 
take into account a multitude of uncertainties. For example, who is to say 
how carefully masons might build a stone wall around a cantilever such 
as shown in Galileo's illustration. Furthermore, who is to say how careful 
the workmen might be in attaching the heavy weight to the end of the 
completed cantilever? How many of them will stand on the beam during 
the construction process, thus adding considerable weight beyond that of 
the boulder being hung from the end? Will they place it gently on the 
hook, or will they drop it with such force that it will endanger the beam 
the way a sudden blow does a pane of glass? And what about the weight 
of the beam itself? While Galileo discussed how it might be taken into 
account, the formulas we have been discussing do not consider it. To cover 
the many contingencies that might overload an understrength beam, 
engineers often divide the predicted weight it can support by as much as 
a factor of six or eight. Such conservatisms are known as factors of safety, 
and while they result in structures that are overdesigned, they also result 
in structures that are more reliable. Though writing with a pencil may 
not seem to involve such critical and structurally abusive loads as erecting 
a beam in a wall or subjecting an airplane wing to a storm's turbulence, 
seeing the similarities between how such apparently diverse structures 
work or can fail to work is essential for successful engineering.

ZIPP E R S  A ND D E V ELOP M E N T  
One of the many time-consuming and often frustrating tasks faced daily 
in the nineteenth century was the fastening and unfastening of the many 
buttons or hooks and eyes found on articles of clothing, including high­
button shoes. With so many fasteners spaced so closely together, it was 
not uncommon for someone dressing quickly or inattentively to skip a 
button or a hook, only to find an extra button hole or eyelet at the bottom 
of a vest or the top of a blouse, requiring a lot of undoing back to the 
mistake and then redoing. Among the many people who must have noted 
and even cursed this and other problems with buttons and hooks and eyes 
was Elias Howe, Jr., the inventor of the sewing machine. Rather than just 
complain about the problem, however, Howe came up with "certain new 
and useful Improvements in Fastenings for Garments, Ladies' Boots, and 
other articles to which they may be applicable," and he was awarded a 
patent in 185 1 .  His patent consists of one page of drawings (Fig. 4. 1) and 
one page of text. 
Howe's device, like all inventions, addressed shortcomings associated 
with the existing way of doing things, as he clearly stated: "The advantage 
of this manner of fastening garments, &c., consists in the ease and 
quickness with which they can be opened or closed, while there is no 
liability of their getting out of order." The manner in which the new 
fastening device was intended to function can readily be seen in the patent 
drawings, and it clearly could work in principle. Certain difficulties in its 
continued smooth operation can also be easily imagined, however. For 
example, Howe's fastening device would require that its metal clasps fit 
snugly, but not too tightly, around the beaded fabric along which they 
would slide. Assuming that this close tolerance between the clasps and 
beading could be achieved in manufacture, it is questionable that it could 
be maintained long in use. As the fastening device was sat upon or 
bumped while moving about, the clasps would no doubt be bent to the

point where they would become more closed and thus bind on the cloth 
or become more loose and thus pull free from the beading. Even if those 
problems could be avoided, in time the repeated back-and-forth move­
ment of the metal clasps on the fabric would fray it to an ineffective, or 
at least an unsightly, condition. 
Whether he foresaw these as insurmountable difficulties with his in­
vention or whether he put it aside because of his preoccupation with 
potentially more lucrative patent-infringement lawsuits that he was pur­
suing against thriving sewing machine manufacturers like Isaac Singer, 
Howe appears not to have tried to improve and market his garment-fas­
tening device. Thus, the design was not developed into a successful 
product, and it survives only on paper. Some historians of technology even 
deny it a place in the history of the zipper, arguing that it does not have 
the interlocking teeth that characterize a true zipper. 
S L I D E  F A S T E N E R S  
The person generally credited with inventing the zipper, although it 
would not be called that for more than 30 years after he obtained his first 
patents for the device, was Whitcomb L. Judson, a Chicago mechanical 
engineer whose earlier patents related to such things as a "pneumatic 
street railway," whose motive power was derived from compressed air. 
Judson has been described as a portly individual who had grown tired of 
bending over to lace up his high boots. Thus finding fault with existing 
technology, Judson came up with a "clasp locker or unlocker for shoes,'' 
for which he applied for a patent in 1891. Unlike Howe, Judson did not 
neglect his idea, and he kept thinking of ways to improve upon his own 
invention. Even before the first patent was issued he filed for another, for 
a "shoe fastening" device (Fig. 4.2). Unlike his first idea, which would 
have altered the way shoes were manufactured, Judson's newer scheme 
had the advantage of being able to be laced into existing shoes. Both 
applications were approved, and the patents were granted on the same 
day in 1893. While Judson may have been motivated by the difficulty he 
encountered in bending over to tie his shoes, he clearly recognized that 
his invention had much wider application: "The invention was especially 
designed, for use as a shoe-fastener; but is capable of general application 
wherever clasps consisting of interlocking parts may be applied, as for 
example, to mail bags, belts, and the closing of seams uniting flexible 
bodies." All these applications would indeed be made, but first the basic

design had to be developed into a reliable device that could be economi­
cally manufactured. 
The promise of Judson's idea attracted the support of Harry L. Earle, 
whom Judson had known since they were both salesmen of agricultural 
machinery and who had been a promoter of the pneumatic railway 
scheme. Principal financial backing came from Lewis A. Walker, a Penn­
sylvania lawyer who foresaw a fortune to be made from Judson's invention, 
and the Universal Fastener Company was formed to exploit the patents. 
Judson's next two patents, issued in 1896, were assigned to the company, 
and they show designs that look more substantial. Early Universal fasteners 
did not sell very well, however, in large part because they tended to pop 
open at inopportune times and because their sharp edges and pointed 
ends tended to tear the fabric of what they were supposed to fasten. 
Furthermore, unless the labor-intensive methods of manufacturing early 
versions of the devices were effectively automated, the prices of the 
fasteners could not be kept low enough to make them attractive to 
potential customers. Thus, Judson had to continue to develop his device 
while at the same time design a machine to manufacture it. 
A decade after his first fastener-patent application, Judson applied for 
a patent for a "chain-making machine," which was granted in 1902 (Fig. 
4.3). This machine was designed to make the "interlocking chains . . .  of 
hooks and links" that were crucial components of a successful fastener. 
Compared to the earlier patents for the fasteners, this one for the machine 
is long, with eight pages of drawings and nine of text. This should not be 
surprising, however, for machines that can automate the manufacture of 
complex products are even more complex, and can contain a great deal 
more moving parts, than their products. Unfortunately, neither Judson's 
machine nor the variety of fasteners that it made was reliable or effective 
enough. He thus developed a new fastener device, in which the trouble­
some chains were replaced with hooks and eyes fastened directly to 
lengths of fabric that could be attached to shoes, garments, and other 
items, and it was possible to make a simpler machine. In the meantime, 
the Universal Fastener Company had evolved into the Fastener Manufac­
turing and Machine Company, which in turn became the Automatic 
Hook and Eye Company. 
The new fastener was marketed under the name C-curity, which clearly 
implied that it did not share its predecessors' characteristic of popping 
open when it was not supposed to. Advertisements for the C-curity fastener 
trumpeted its advantages: "A pull and it's done! No more open skirts . . .

into an open skirt or pair of trousers. Every manufacturer should want to 
know of such problems with its products, of course, so that they may be 
addressed in further development. However, in the case of C-curity, the 
already wordy and complicated instructions for applying the fastener to 
garments seemed to convey a lack of uncertainty on the part of the 
manufacturer: "Customers will confer a favor on us by reporting any 
difficulty in applying fastener, in which case we will send more detailed 
instructions." 
The Automatic Hook and Eye Company was becoming concerned that 
Judson's earliest patents were soon to expire, and other inventors were 
beginning to patent newer versions of what were coming to be known as 
slide fasteners. Among these was Ida Josephine Calhoun, of Tampa, 
Florida, whose 1908 patent represented an "improvement in the applica­
tion of the slide fastener to dresses.'' At about the same time, inventors in 
Europe were also being issued patents for slide fasteners. One design that 
was very similar to what would eventually become the familiar zipper was 
invented by .Katherina Kuhn-Moos and Henri Forster of Zurich, Switzer­
land, who received Swiss, German, and British patents in 1912. 
In the meantime, the Automatic Hook and Eye Company had hired 
Gideon Sundback, who was born in Sweden and educated in Sweden 
and Germany as an electrical engineer. He came to America in 1905 and 
began working for the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Com­
pany in Pittsburgh, but a year later went to work for Automatic Hook and 
Eye as a draftsman and design engineer responsible for further develop­
ment of the machinery. Sundback was brought to Automatic Hook and 
Eye by Peter Aronson, who had been responsible for keeping "Judson's 
machine running long enough and steadily enough so that its defects 
could be diagnosed and cured," and who had come to be in charge of 
manufacturing. It has also been said that Aronson's daughter, whom 
Sundback later married, had something to do with the engineer leaving 
Westinghouse for Automatic Hook and Eye. While Sundback's electrical 
engineering background might appear to have been odd for someone 
expected to work on the development of machinery that was more in the 
realm of mechanical engineering, such seemingly cross-disciplinary career 
moves by engineers have always been common. Well into the second half 
I N V E N T I O N  BY 
D E S I G N  
72 

of the twentieth century, there was a great deal of commonality among 
the different engineering curricula, with electrical engineers expected to 
know about machinery and mechanical engineers expected to know about 
electricity. 
Sundback began working on improvements to the C-curity fastener, 
which continued to have a tendency to spring open when it was flexed, 
and on the machinery. After the aging Judson died in 1909, Sundback 
became the engineer most committed to the development of the fastener, 
and his new model, called the Plako because of its intended application 
to the seam opening in garments known as a placket. The Plako, however, 
also left a lot to be desired, and sales were not strong. It was said that the 
secretary of the company, who proudly wore a Plako in his trousers, had 
to rush home one evening because the fastener popped open and got 
stuck in that position. The Automatic Hook and Eye Company verged on 
bankruptcy, and it maintained its existence mainly by manufacturing 
various kinds of small metal devices, including paper fasteners. Sundback 
would not give up on the slide fastener, however, and he continued to 
develop the basic idea and the machinery to implement it economically 
with a high degree of reliability. 
H O O K L E S S  F A S T E N E R S 
Since the hooks of the various fastener models seemed to be the cause of 
most of the malfunctions, Sundback began to look toward ways of elimi­
nating them. One model, whose patent application was initially filed in 
1912 and amended in 1917 (Fig. 4.4), had clasps on one side that fit over 
a bead on the other, with the slider opening and closing the clasps to 
open and close the fastener. Lewis Walker, whose financial support had 
been faithful for over two decades, was enthusiastic about the new model 
and described it as having a "hidden hook," but it came to be known as 
a "hookless fastener," eventually to be called Hookless No. 1. However, 
as could be anticipated with Howe's concept of 60 years earlier, there was 
considerable catching during operation and much wear and tear on the 
bead. Sundback went back to the drawingboard. 
Sundback described the next design that he came up with as another 
"radical departure in principle from the design of earlier slide fasteners," 
one that was "built up of nested, cup-shaped members." His patent 
application was filed in 1914, and it represented the efforts of over 20 
years of design, redesign, and development that had taken place since 
Judson's first promising patents were issued. The radical departure, (shown

in Fig. 4.5) came to be known as Hookless No. 2 and is remarkably similar 
to today's zipper. However, even though the principle of the slide fastener 
had finally been "perfected" in the latest hookless model, there remained 
the problem of its efficient manufacture. To address this, Sundback un­
dertook another arduous period of development, which resulted in a new 
machine, which he called the S-L machine, with the letters standing for 
"scrapless." In its final form, the machine worked wonderfully, slicing off 
pieces of specially formed wire with a Y cross section, stamping a pocket 
into one side and letting it bulge out the other, and pinching the open 
part of the Y around fabric tape being fed through the machine. There 
was indeed no wasted or scrap metal, and production was smooth and 
reliable. Figure 4.6 shows a later version of a zipper-making machine. 
While the long development process had finally reached its goal about 
a quarter century after it began, marketing and sales of hookless fasteners 
still faced some difficult years. There was a measure of success during 
World War I, when hookless fasteners were sewn into flying suits, making 
them windproof for flyers, and into money belts that were sold to army 
and navy personnel. Another application, also foreseen by Howe in 18 5 1 ,  
was the limited use of hookless fasteners in mail pouches, but the incor­
poration of the devices into tobacco pouches proved to be more profitable. 
Clothing applications remained scarce, in part because manufacturers 
would have had to invest in retraining their employees to sew in the more 
expensive fastening devices, and such applications were not to become 
very prominent until the 1930s. Rubber galoshes were another matter, 
however, and the hookless fastener proved to be an excellent means for 
opening and closing overshoes, which had to be put on and taken off very 
easily and quickly in cold and snowy weather. In the early 1920s the B. 
F. Goodrich Company began to order increasing numbers of fasteners, 
and they soon introduced their new product: "The Mystik Boot with the 
patented Hookless Fastener. Opens with a pull. Closes with a pull." The 
name Mystik did not attract the business Goodrich thought the boots 
deserved, however, and for the 1923 season they were renamed to suggest 
the way they zipped open and closed. Hence, the trademarked name 
Zippers, which soon became the unofficial name of the hookless fasteners 
themselves. In 1928 the Hookless Fastener Company began to use the 
brand name Talon to suggest the tenacious gripping power of the claw of 
a bird of prey and convey the idea that the newer fasteners would not fall 
open at the wrong time. About ten years later, the company's name was 
changed to Talon, Inc.

By the end of the 1930s, Talon was facing active competition in the 
zipper industry. Early patents had expired, and other manufacturers had 
been designing and developing their own machines. One employed by 
the Conmar Products Corporation stamped zipper teeth, properly called 
scoops, out of a flattened strip of wire at the rate of 50 per second. Another, 
patented in 1932 by Gustav Johnson, cast the teeth directly onto a con­
tinuous piece of zipper tape. The toothed tape was then mated with 
another piece, and long lengths of it were collected on spools, ready to 
be cut and fitted with ends and sliders and thus formed into individual 
zippers of appropriate size and style. 
German zipper factories were destroyed during World War II, but 
rather than rebuild them after the war to prewar standards, the Germans 
developed the new technology of plastic-toothed zippers, which had been 
pioneered in America in the 1940s. Instead of individual metal teeth or 
scoops, plastic ones could be fastened to the zipper tape (see Fig. 4.7). 
Subsequent developments included weaving notched plastic wire into 
lengths of zipper and casting plastic teeth or coils directly onto the zipper 
tape. Plastic zippers had the advantage of being able to be made in any 
Z I P P E R S  A N D  D E V E L O P M E N T  
77 

F I G U R E  4.7 Forms of modern zippers, including tWo with plastic teeth 
color. The cloth tape could be dyed to match the plastic scoops or coils, 
and thus the zippers sewn into garments could be made virtually invisible. 
This was a boon to the fashion industry and much appreciated by clothes 
buyers, for aesthetic and technical reasons alike. 
Such developments were clearly motivated by looking for ways to make 
zippers better or more economical, and suםh incremental variations and 
improvements on the same basic idea characterize much of engineering 
research and development. In contrast to this kind of evolutionary change, 
however, there also can occur the kind of revolutionary change that comes 
not from looking at how to make an existing thing better but at how to 
make something in an entirely different way or based on an entirely 
different principle. The inspiration for such change can come to an 
inventor or engineer when it is least expected, but that is not to say that 
the individual's mind was not prepared to see in an instant the idea's 
potential. 
In 1948, on returning from a walk with his dog through some Alpine 
woodland, the Swiss inventor George de Mestral stopped to remove some 
woodland cockleburs from his trousers and his dog's fur. As he was doing 
so, he wondered why the burs stuck the way they did, and he started home 
to look at them under a microscope in his workshop. On the way, he 
speculated about the mechanism that might cause the sticking, and he 
thought about how it might provide an alternative to the conventional 
zipper for fastening clothes. While he had not at the time been con­
sciously thinking about inventing such a device, a few months earlier he 
had had an annoying time with a stuck zipper on his wife's dress. At that

F I G U R E  4.8 
The principle of Velcro 
time, he had wondered if he might not invent something to replace the 
metal zipper, but he had come up with nothing. De Mestral was no 
stranger to invention, however, for he had received his first patent when 
he was twelve years old, for a toy airplane. (He would receive his last, for 
a popular asparagus peeler, when he was in his sixties.) 
Under his microscope, de Mestral confirmed what he had suspected, 
namely, that the surface of the bur consisted of numerous tiny hooks, 
which easily got caught in the loops of woven clothing fabric, strands of 
dog hair, and the like. On the other hand, when rolled in his fingers, the 
bur felt springy, because the fingers simply depressed the rounded backs 
of the hooks. Almost immediately de Mestral conceived of a new fastening 
system consisting of two cloth strips, one faced with tiny hooks and a 
mating one faced with tiny loops (see Fig. 4.8). When sewn into a dress 
or other garment, with the hook and loop sides facing each other, a soft 
but tenacious fastener that would not get stuck would result. 
As with Judson's metal zipper, the basic conceptual design was sound, 
but it had to be developed into a smoothly functioning product that could 
be manufactured in a reliable way. When he approached textile experts 
about manufacturing the hooked tape, they were skeptical. It was only 
when a weaver in a textile plant in Lyon, France, produced one strip of 
cotton fabric with little hooks and one with little eyes, the pair of which 
de Mestral called "locking tape," that the idea looked realizable. Yet many 
details still had to be worked out if the new fastening system was to be 
easy to open and close, hold firmly when closed, and continue to function 
through many wearings and cleanings. Among the many questions that 
Z I P P E R S  A N D  D E V E L O P M E N T  
79 

had to be faced in developing a successful device were how many hooks 
it should have, of what material they should be made, how they were to 
be formed, and so forth. Similar questions had to be addressed for the 
loops (A proper number of loops was eventually found to be 300 per square 
inch.) In time, the cotton of the working prototype produced in Lyon 
would be replaced with nylon, which was more durable. And among the 
discoveries made during the process of development was that weaving the 
nylon under infrared light hardened it into hooks and eyes that were 
virtually indestructible. 
In all, it took about six years from de Mestral's conceptual design to 
come up with a commercially viable product and the machinery to 
produce it economically. The first factory to manufacture the hook-and­
loop tape was opened in 1957, almost ten years after the inventor's 
inspiring walk. The product was sold under the catchy trademark Velcro, 
which was a portmanteau made by combining the beginnings of the 
French words "velour" and "crochet." The former, meaning velvet, refers 
to the soft loop tape, while the latter, meaning small hook, refers to the 
firmer hook tape. As with so many successful products, the name for a 
particular one came to be used generically. Properly speaking, Velcro-like 
devices are collectively called hook-and-loop fasteners, but most people 
continue to use the shorter and catchier term velcro. By whatever name, 
60 million yards of the stuff was being produced by the late 1950s, and it 
soon was being used in applications as diverse as sealing the chambers of 
artificial hearts, holding objects in place in the weightlessness of space­
craft, and closing dresses, diapers, and shoes. 
Velcro was quite successful, but it did not displace the zipper in the 
way de Mestral might have dreamed. While the zipper continued to have 
its shortcomings, such as becoming stuck now and then, more significant 
shortcomings of velcro began to become apparent with its increasing use. 
No matter how hardened by infrared light, for example, the material did 
tend to wear out with time, especially when undergoing repeated wash­
ings. Thus the application in baby diapers did not live up to its early 
promise. While the very noise that it makes when opened or closed is 
associated positively with the zipper's name, the noise that velcro makes 
upon being opened can be considered harsh and annoying. Another 
problem with velcro is its bulkiness. Whereas metal and plastic zippers 
had evolved toward thinner and thinner designs, so that they are hardly 
noticeable in clothing, velcro fasteners tend to produce a certain bulki-
I N V E N T I O N  BY 
D E S I G N  
80 

ness, especially when applied to thin fabrics. While velcro maintains 
certain advantages in specific applications, it did not turn out to be the 
last word in fastenings. 
P L A S T I C  Z I P P E R S  
Problems with metal zippers, from sticking and snagging to rusting and 
losing teeth, continued to attract inventors who thought they could im­
prove upon the device. Indeed, the increasing success the zipper experi­
enced as a commercial product during the 1930s and 1940s, with a billion 
a year being made by the end of that period, increasingly brought its 
shortcomings to the minds of inventors all over the world. One of them 
lived in Denmark, and his name was Borgda Madsen. He came up with 
the idea of a completely plastic zipper-not just one with plastic teeth or 
loops or scoops attached to color-coordinated fabric but one that was 
entirely made of plastic and that had not individual interlocking parts but 
a single long pair of mating grooves. Not only did Madsen's zipper remove 
the problems of snagging and jamming, but it had the additional advan­
tages of being waterproof, dustproof, and airtight. As such, it had consid­
erable potential for applications well beyond the clothing industry, but 
these took years of development and marketing to realize. 
Inventors always have the choice of developing their own inventions 
and manufacturing products incorporating them, but such endeavors take 
money that the inventors may not have and take time that they may prefer 
to spend pursuing other inventions. In the case of Madsen, he sold the 
rights to the plastic zipper to some British investors, who in turn sold the 
American and Canadian rights in 195 1 to some refugees from Romania. 
Max Ausnit, his son Steven, and his uncle Edgar formed a New York-based 
company called Flexigrip to exploit the new product. But first it had to 
be developed into a reliable product, and that responsibility fell to the 
youngster, Steven Ausnit, who had a degree in mechanical engineering. 
Since by this time the metal zipper had become so familiar in clothing, 
the first inclinations of the Flexigrip developers were to promote their 
product as a better clothing zipper. After all, unlike hard metal zippers, 
it was soft and pliable and thus promised to be more comfortable. How­
ever, the plastic-grooved zipper tended to twist and come apart in such 
applications, and it clearly was not going to be a very successful competi­
tor. Prior to the introduction of the plastic zipper, the conventional metal 
variety had also been used in such applications as garment storage bags 
Z I P P E R S  A N D  D E V E L O P M E N T  
81 

and similar products made of vinyl. However, the conventional zippers 
had to be sewn with thread into these products, and the sewing holes 
introduced served as stress concentrators from which began tears in the 
vinyl that eventually grew to unacceptable lengths. Such products were 
not easy to repair with needle and thread, and so they were not very 
popular. The totally plastic zipper promised to be ideal fמr these applica­
tions, for it could be heat welded to the vinyl and thus provide a strong 
and permanent bond. 
Not until the mid-1950s, however, when the Flexigrip was applied to 
some products that remained essentially flat in their use, was the company 
able to realize some measure of growth. Among its products were plastic 
pencil cases and plastic briefcases, and the latter became especially pop­
ular at meetings and conferences, where they were distributed to atten­
dees to carry around the various papers and programs they accumulated. 
(In 1955 President Eisenhower was called upon in the White House 
and presented with a portfolio fitted with a plastic "toothless" zipper in 
conjunction with an invitation to attend an upcoming meeting of the 
American Society of Mechanical Engineers.) Beginning in the early 
1950s, experiments with plastics other than vinyl were also overseen by 
Ausnit, and from the earliest days of Flexigrip there was talk of extrud­
ing fasteners out of such materials as nylon and polyethylene. The latter 
could be used in conjunction with polyethylene film to provide air­
tight and water-tight packaging that could be opened and reclosed for 
storage. 
In the early 1960s Ausnit applied for a series of patents relating to plastic 
fasteners intended for the top of plastic bags, thus providing convenient 
storage bags for small parts and other items. His idea was to modify the 
way a plastic zipper would open so that it would be more effective in such 
applications. There was also an increasing development away from the 
use of a slider and toward the use of forces applied directly by the fingers 
to open and close the bags (Fig. 4.9), thus reducing their bulk, cost, and 
complexity of manufacture. Ausnit's early patents show the zipper portion 
of the bag to be a distinctly different assembly than the bag proper, 
however, and this meant that the zipper had to be heat-welded to the bag 
as a separate manufacturing step, with all its attendant difficulties of 
curling and warping of the bag material that had to be anticipated and 
dealt with. In particular, the bag walls and strips attached to the zipper 
had to be made extra-thick, and hence extra-expensive, to accommodate 
the heat-sealing process without forming leakage holes or otherwise dam-

One of Steven Ausnit's many patents for a plastic zipper, this one opened 
and closed either with a mechanical slider or manually

aging the material. Whereas these precautions often called for a bag at 
least 3 to 4 mils thick ( 1  mil 
= 0.001 inch), an alternative means of 
forming the bags enabled them to be as thin as 1 mil. 
This was made possible because a Japanese inventor, Kakuji Naito, had 
developed and patented a method whereby the components of the zipper 
closure could be extruded as an integral part of the plastiן bag (Fig. 4. 10). 
The bags come out of the extruder as long hollow circular tubes with the 
zipper components located at the proper points on the circumference. 
The tubes are air cooled to set the plastic before being flattened, thus 
mating the zipper parts, and rolled onto collector drums. The bags proper 
are formed by unrolling the flat tube, printing it where desired, and 
cutting it into bag lengths, which are heat sealed (Fig. 4.1 1). The top 
above the zipper opening can be left uncut, can be perforated, or can be 
cut at this time. The bottoms can also be cut to allow filling by automated 
machinery, after which they can be reclosed by heat sealing. Naito's 
patents were assigned to the Tokyo-based company Kabushiki Kaisha 
Seisan Nihon Sha, and they enabled resealable plastic bags to be manu­
factured at about half the cost of those made by heat-welding a separately 
extruded zipper. 
In 1962 Ausnit's firm acquired American rights to the Japanese process, 
and the newly named company, Minigrip, Inc., became the first to manu­
facture· in the United States a fully extruded plastic bag with integral 
miniature zipper. At first, however, it was difficult to get manufacturers to 
adopt it for use in their products, in part because it was unconventional. 
(The phenomenon of new products being rejected simply because they 
are too different from what they are intended to supersede has led to a 
design dictim among industrial designers that is captured in the acronym, 
MAYA. It stands for "Most Advanced Yet Acceptable.") For example, when 
the new bag was proposed as an ideal reclosable, dust-free outer packaging 
for record albums, record industry representatives rejected it because they 
did not believe record buyers would understand the package and would 
cut or tear it open, thus destroying its relatively expensive reclosable 
feature. 
The way around this impasse came when Minigrip, in addition to 
making and selling resealable plastic bags themselves, granted the Dow 
Chemical Company an exclusive license to sell them directly to consum­
ers through supermarkets. These handy new products came to be known 
as Ziploc bags, and their success helped Minigrip market the more heavy-

One of the frustrations experienced by users of early reclos­
able plastic bags was that it was -not easy to determine when 
they were closed securely. A competitor thus introduced the 
idea of making the two sides of the plastic zipper closure 
appear as stripes of different primary colors, one yellow and 
one blue, which, when properly mated to give a good seal, 
produced a uniform green band. This useful improvement 
was not only patentable but also provided a very effective 
marketing device. 
Can you think of some other modifications of plastic bags 
that would make it easier to close them tightly and to know 
that they are closed? 
87 

duty bags to commercial and industrial users, a right the company had 
retained. 
The success of Ziploc bags naturally attracted rival brands, which 
employed improvements on the basic design to secure separate patents. 
As with the evolution of all artifacts, arguments for these new patents 
rested upon finding fault with existing patents. Ironically .after reclosable 
bags became commonplace in the kitchen and workshop, it was not 
opening them but closing them properly that became the focus of manu­
facturers and users alike. 
But not all potential competitors looked for new patents as a means of 
entering the market. Manufacturers in Taiwan and other Far East coun­
tries, in particular, totally disregarded the patents that Ausnit and Minigrip 
had so systematically acquired in order to protect their investment. Plastic 
bags from Taiwan, for example, produced with inexpensive labor and not 
having to recover the research and development or patent licensing costs 
normally associated with a new product, could be sold for a fraction of 
the cost of the Minigrip product. In such cases of unfair trade, a company 
can appeal to the International Trade Council Court, which Minigrip did. 
Such appeals are seldom upheld, but in this case an Exclusion Order was 
issued by the Court which essentially banned bags of foreign competitors 
that infringed on the patents held by Minigrip. 
The stories of the original zipper, Velcro, the plastic zipper, and the 
resealable plastic bag derived from it each span many years and show how 
long and arduous the development of a conceptual design or a patent 
idea can be. These case studies also demonstrate how the success of one 
product leads to the conception and development of many derivative 
ideas, which in turn lead to others.

An idea that unifies all of engineering is the concept of failure. From the 
simplest paper clips to the finest pencil leads to the smoothest operating 
zippers, inventions are successful only to the extent that their creators 
properly anticipate how a device can fail to perform as intended. Virtually 
every calculation that an engineer performs in the development of com­
puters and airplanes, or telescopes and fax machines, is a failure calcula­
tion. In analyzing the cantilever beam, even Galileo began by making 
assumptions about how it would break or fail. Today, in designing a 
cantilever bridge, the engineer must have an understanding of how much 
load the individual steel members can safely carry before they pull apart 
or buckle and how much deflection can be allowed in the center of the 
bridge. 
Such considerations, made explicit at the outset, are known as failure 
criteria, and they provide limits that cannot be exceeded as the design 
develops, whether the artifact is a bridge, a building, or a beverage can. 
As the engineer calculates the forces and deflections of a trial design, each 
resulting numerical calculation takes on meaning and becomes accept­
able only in comparison to failure criteria, which may have been deter­
mined by careful laboratory experiments on the materials and components 
in question. While most of our discussion up to this point has been 
couched in terms of the analysis of force and strength, form and function, 
similar remarks apply to problems involving other properties and criteria 
such as heat transfer calculations and the melting point of materials, or 
voltage and current calculations and their safe values in electrical con­
ductors. 
What distinguishes the engineer from the technician is largely the 
ability to formulate and carry out the detailed calculations of forces and 
deflections, concentrations and flows, voltages and currents, that are 
required to test a proposed design on paper with regard to failure criteria. 
89 

The ability to calculate is the ability to predict the performance of a design 
before it is built and tested. By understanding how and why a proposed 
design can fail, and by being able to calculate the quantities needed to 
assess whether failure conditions prevail, the engineer is able to test a 
design on the drawingboard or on the computer screen before any steel 
is erected, any valve is opened, or any switch is thrown. C!llculations that 
indicate failure conditions in the design enable the engineer to modify 
and remodify the design until it is ready to be realized. 
Failure manifests itself differently in different branches of engineering. 
In environmental engineering, for example, where limiting conditions 
may be expressed in parts of pollutant per billion parts of water, an 
environmental engineer needs to know how to calculate the amount of 
a contaminant that might seep from a proposed hazardous-waste disposal 
site into the soil near a source of groundwater, and then compare this 
result to the criteria set by federal regulations. Some problems of engi­
neering design do not lend themselves so much to analytical calculations 
as to trial-and-error or to build-and-measure techniques. 
Sometimes engineers test their ideas by simply imagining scenarios of 
use and behavior that might lead to the failure of a product and then 
trying out the product under those conditions. In the design of computer 
programs, for example, the software is first "alpha tested" by its designers 
and then "beta tested" by real users to uncover the bugs that might have 
been inadvertently introduced during design or modification, and to discover 
how the program might fail to perform as intended. Whatever the method 
used to test a design, obviating failure is always the underlying principle. 
Failure can take nontechnical forms. A design can be considered a 
failure if it is environmentally unsound or aesthetically unsatisfying. Such 
criteria ought to be taken into account from the beginning of the design 
phase, just as the strength of materials is. Often, however, technical details 
dominate the early stages of a design, when an engineer is trying to 
establish whether a particular idea is physically feasible. 
In order to explore in more detail the role of failure in successful 
engineering design, let us consider something a bit more complicated 
than a paper clip or a pencil but still less massive than a bridge or a water 
supply system, and more tangible than the flow of electrons through a wire 
or a computer chip. All of us are likely to have held an aluminum beverage 
can in our hand at one time or another, and so we all may be assumed 
to have at least a passing familiarity with this now- ubiquitous artifact. The 
aluminum can may be described as a pressure vessel when it contains a 
I N V E N T I O N  B Y  D E S I G N

carbonated beverage (and even more so when it has been dropped or 
shaken up), and in this regard the lowly can has to be designed as carefully 
against accidental failure by explosion as does a steam boiler or a scuba 
diving tank. The successful design of an aluminum can depends on un­
derstanding how it can fail to contain its contents and on obviating the 
possibility that it will fail before it is supposed to. Carbonated beverage 
cans are made safe and reliable by using enough material in the proper 
configuration to keep the intensity of force within bounds of strength and 
to keep the cans from bulging out in the wrong places. But engineering 
also has to a lot to do with economics, and the object in designing and 
manufacturing something made by the billions, like beverage cans, is to 
make them extremely safe and reliable while at the same time costing as 
little as possible. A too-expensive beverage can will fail to survive the 
competition. While this may be considered a nontechnical failure mode, 
it is a failure mode nonetheless.

The earliest food and beverage cans were made of iron and were often as 
heavy as the food they contained. Moreover, their robust construction 
made opening them a major effort-some of the first iron cans even had 
instructions for opening that involved the use of a hammer and chisel. 
With the development of stronger steel, cans could be made thinner and 
thus lighter, but still they were difficult to open, and therefore specialized 
can openers were invented to make the task easier. Aluminum-because 
it was more expensive than steel-could not compete as a material for 
food cans, which had to be strong enough to resist being dented too easily. 
But with beverage containers it was a different story. Because soft drinks 
and beer pressurize a can, they provide some of its stiffness and make a 
thinner (and cheaper) can wall possible. On the other hand, the contents 
under pressure in turn requires the can wall to be strong enough to resist 
being split open just by the force of its contents. 
Since aluminum is generally a much more ductile material than steel, 
it can be formed into containers in more direct and effective ways. Steel 
cans were long made by bending a flat sheet into a hollow cylinder, joining 
it along its seam, and adding top and bottom, a multistep, multipart 
process. By contrast, the entire seamless bottom and sides of an aluminum 
can could be formed from a single disk of metal (see Fig. 5.1), with only 
a top to be added after the can was filled with its contents. This formability 
of aluminum gave it a clear advantage in making cans by the billions.

It is relatively easy to calculate how thick the aluminum must be to 
contain the pressure of the beverage and to take advantage of the pressure 
as it works to stiffen the thin-walled can against being crushed or dented. 
But the pressure would also tend to balloon out the flat bottom of an 
aluminum can, preventing it from sitting flat on a shelf or table. Thus, 
the characteristic inwardly dished bottom was developed, to act somewhat 
like an arch dam against the pressure while allowing the can to sit flat 
and stable on its rim. Were it not for this and other of its various structural 
features, the aluminum can would fail to be a very useful innovation. 
The first aluminum cans were opened in conventional ways, which 
usually meant with a pointed can opener known as a church key. When 
this once-indispensable implement was first introduced, steel beer cans 
came with illustrated directions for its use printed on their labels. By the 
time aluminum cans were introduced, there was no need for such direc­
tions, and using the common opener was not considered especially in­
convenient, since people had long become accustomed to the two-step 
process: First, a triangular-shaped hole was punched with the lever-opener 
in the can top, and then the whole can was rotated 1 80° about its 
cylindrical axis so that a second hole could be punched diametrically 
opposite the first. The contents of the can could then be poured or drunk 
easily from one hole, while the other allowed air to enter the can and 
displace the liquid, thus providing a more steady flow without spilling any 
of the contents. The two-step process soon had become such a familiar 
one to can users that they hardly gave it a second thought, and few 
probably realized it could be improved upon. 
However, the necessity of using a church key did present a problem to 
at least one thirsty individual when a can opener was nowhere to be found, 
and little annoyances and predicaments such as this are what catch the

attention of inventors and clever engineers. One evening, while Erma! 
Fraze, of Dayton, Ohio, was reflecting on having found himself earlier 
that day without a can opener while on a picnic, he set out to devise a 
self-opening can. Though many may have realized how convenient it 
would be to do away with can openers, Fraze was in a position to do 
something definitive about the problem because of his knowledge of 
metal forming and scoring. He came up with the idea for the now-familiar 
aluminum tab-top or pop-top can in an evening and perfected it shortly 
thereafter (see Fig. 5.2). 
Although much of engineering has to do with avoiding failure at almost 
any cost, the development of a self-opening aluminum can top presents 
an interesting example of balancing the competing aims of preventing 
and encouraging failure. Clearly, we would not want a beverage can to 
pop open spontaneously or too easily, and so the pop-top must be a 
relatively robust design. On the other hand, we do not want to have to 
exert undue force to open the can when we are thirsty. Scoring the can 
top just the right amount leaves enough strength to contain the pressure 
while at the same time providing a preferred site for the metal to fail (that 
is, tear open) when desired. The tab attached to the top of a pop-top can 
effectively serves as a small lever (somewhat akin to a little church key) 
to magnify the force of the fingers and cause the top to fail in a controlled 
way. However, because the contents are under pressure, the process is 
complicated. 
In Fraze's early designs, the tab was riveted to the can top, and the rivet 
served as the lever's fulcrum. In some early designs, the rivet was a source 
of leaks. In others, the rivet was too easily pulled out of the top, thus 
leaving the thirsty consumer scurrying to find a church key to open the 
can in the conventional way. In other cases, when the lever was pushed 
into the can top to break the pressure seal, the rush of pressure was liable 
to make the top fly off and threaten the well-being of the would-be drinker. 
Such failures of the device to work properly led inventors and engineers 
like Fraze to improve incrementally the pop-top until it was so reliable 
and operated with so few surprises that it began to be taken for granted. 
One engineering professor uses the aluminum beverage can in a very 
dramatic experiment to demonstrate the complexity of failure modes that 
engineers often face in their pursuit of fool-proof designs. He places an 
unopened can inside a large plastic Ziploc bag and, to be doubly sure, 
for reasons that will be apparent, encloses the can and bag in a second 
Ziploc bag. He then places the can between heavy rings on the platform

and moveable head of the kind of testing machine usually employed to 
crush concrete samples to determine their (failure) strength, and the kind 
that David Letterman used on his old Late Night show to crush everything 
from light bulbs to watermelons. 
In the aluminum-can engineering experiment, the rings bear on the 
rims of the can so that the machine's force does not bear directly on the 
center of either the top or bottom of the can, which can be taken out of 
the machine at various stages during the test to be inspected for damage. 
Before turning the machine on to begin the slow but deliberate crushing 
of the can between the powerful faces of the machine, the students are 
asked how they think the can is going to behave. In other words, how is 
the can going to fail? The variety of answers that result demonstrates how 
much more complicated a structure the aluminum can is than a cantilever 
beam. Whereas Galileo was faced with the relatively easy but, in his time, 
far from trivial problem of figuring out how the cantilever failed at the 
wall, there was no doubt about where it would fail. 
In the case of the aluminum can in the testing machine, however, 
there are many conceivable ways in which failure can occur, and students 
usually have little trouble coming up with a goodly list. Furthermore, 
different failure modes can develop as the test progresses. Among the more 
obvious possibilities are: (I) the pressure of the compressed liquid splits 
the can's sides open, (2) the compression of the top causes the stepped 
neck to be pushed down into the can, (3) the can's sides wrinkle the way 
they do in an empty can, (4) the can's bottom pops out to accommodate 
the increased pressure, (5) the can's bottom splits open, (6) the can's top 
arches to accommodate the pressure, (7) the rivet in the pop-top is ejected 
or split open, acting like a pressure relief valve, (8) the top cracks open 
where it is scored, (9) the can begins to leak around the rim where the 
top joins the sides. Different styles of can are likely to exhibit different 
failure modes in different sequences and at different load levels, and the 
plastic bags themselves may fail in their own way, giving the onlookers a 
sticky shower. (To avoid such surprises, it is best also to surround the can 
and bags with a heavy plexiglass cylindrical shell.) 
Whatever happens to a can in a testing machine, it is clear that the 
possibilities of failure are multifarious and generally beyond deterministic 
calculation. That is not to say that aluminum beverage can manufacturers 
and others do not consider such things. Among the losers as aluminum 
cans have become widely accepted has been the steel beverage can (see 
Fig. 5.3), and the steel can industry has long been trying to regain its

Growth of aluminum beverage cans at the expense of steel cans 
once-dominant position. For years, research and development has been 
conducted to come up with a competitive steel can, and among the most 
vexing of problems has been how to design a steel pop-top that does not 
leave a sharp or jagged edge to cut the drinker's lips. For a while, steel 
can bodies were fitted with aluminum pop-tops, but this complicated 
recycling efforts. 
By 1993 steel cans were being made, like aluminum ones, in a draw­
ing process that produced walls as thin as 0.0025 inches, which is less 
than the thickness of a piece of copier paper. Even with such thin 
walls, the "column load strength," or the force it would take to crush a 
full can by standing on it, was maintained at 340 pounds, and the steel 
can's "dome reversal strength,'' or the pressure it would take to pop out 
the bottom, was held at 100 pounds per square inch (psi). Even with 
such advances, the approximately 3 billion steel beverage cans shipped 
annually amounted to only a small percentage of the 100 billion total 
beverage cans, about 97 percent of which were aluminum, made in the 
United States. 
Calculations employed in the design of beverage cans, or of engineer­
ing systems even more complicated, provide quantitative starting points 
· for assessing if failure criteria are met, and guidance for changes in 
response to unacceptable behavior. For example, knowing the highest

Some years ago, in a popular commercial on television, a 
fellow smashed a beer can against his forehead. Did it hurt? 
Was the can closed or open, and would that make a differ­
ence? (This question requires only a theoretical answer. Do 
not attempt to investigate through experimental means.) 
Although aluminum beverage cans must be designed 
primarily to withstand the internal pressure of their con­
tents, most are designed to be strong enough (before being 
opened) to support a good-sized person standing on them. 
Is this behavior something that happens frequently in fra­
ternity houses and such places, or are there other reasons 
for this design criterion?

pressure the contents are likely ever to be under, one could calculate the 
thinnest aluminum wall that could contain such pressure. To make a can 
thinner would not be a very likely place to start. But the thinnest possible 
can that could contain the pressure might not be acceptable, for it might 
not support enough vertical load to allow cases of cans to be stacked for 
shipment or storage. Further, there are other failure modes (such as those 
in the above list) and other considerations that relate to the use of the can 
when it has been opened and the pressure has been released. 
Because an opened (and thus unpressurized) aluminum can must be 
sufficiently rigid to stand up on a table and not be crushed in the hand 
that lifts it to the lips, there is a limit to how thin it can be. We all know 
that cans are already almost at their practical limits of thinness because 
we must be careful not to hold them too tightly lest their sides buckle in 
and the can becomes unstable in our grasp. While such a consideration 
might not be strictly a question of strength or safety, it is clearly a limiting 
condition for the can to function comfortably in use, and it certainly 
constitutes another failure criterion that must be taken into account in 
the design. 
An analogy can be found in building design. Much taller and more 
slender skyscrapers than presently נxist could easily be built economically 
without any danger of collapsing, but with height and slenderness come 
flexibility, and this becomes the limiting factor on what can be practically 
achieved. The top floors of too flexible a skyscraper could sway several 
feet in just a gentle wind, and this can cause coffee to slosh around in 
mugs, elevators to bang and bind in shafts, and office workers to feel 
queasy at their desks. While no dramatic or catastrophic failure is occur­
ring in such a situation, the structure has clearly failed to provide psycho­
logically or physiologically effective office space for its users. From the 
total engineering perspective, and the economic or use value of the 
structure, this could be as much a failure as if the building had to be 
abandoned for structural reasons.

By the early 1970s it became evident that the removable tab-tops of 
beverage cans were creating an environmental crisis. The small, sharp, 
ringed tabs of aluminum were being disposed of by the billions on 
roadsides, in parks, and on beaches. Besides creating a litter problem, they 
were presenting physical dangers where recreation seekers went barefoot 
I N V E N T I O N  BY 
D E S I G N  
98 

and where small children swallowed things not intended to be ingested. 
Especially on beaches, where the tab-tops were often too small to be 
caught in the standard beachcomber's rake, there was many a foot cut on 
an unseen tab lying just below the surface of the sand. Conscientious 
drinkers began to drop the tab into the can from which they were 
drinking, only to swallow it with a mouthful of beverage. In short, what 
began as a technological godsend for drinkers without church keys ended 
up as a devil of a problem. 
This was a clear failure of the pop-top can to be a benign beverage 
container, and it sent inventors and engineers back to the drawingboard. 
A plethora of solutions resulted, including a can developed by the Adolph 
Coors Company in which a small aluminum button was first pushed into 
the top to break the pressure seal and then a second, larger button was 
pushed in to provide a drinking hole. Both buttons remained hinged to 
the can top and so created neither a litter problem nor a hazard. However, 
in order for the can top to function properly (actually, to fail in the proper 
mode at the proper time), the little button had to be small enough so that 
the total force of the pressure acting on it did not require too great a push 
to break the seal. But the smaller the button, the sharper it felt to the 
finger pushing it, and so opening a can could be an uncomfortable 
process. Such annoying details, coupled with the fact that two separate 
buttons had to be pressed to get at the beverage, as if one were using a 
church key again, led other inventors to look for alternatives. What 
evolved is the now familiar pop-top, in which the manipulation of a lever 
breaks the pressure seal, opens an orifice, and folds back (but does not 
break off) a flap of aluminum. 
The stay-on tab was the invention of Daniel F. Cudzik, of Richmond, 
Virginia, who worked for the Reynolds Metals Company. In 1976 he was 
awarded a United States Patent (Fig. 5.4) for his invention of an easy-open 
aluminum can top with a tab that stayed attached. This development was 
instrumental in keeping the aluminum can from being outlawed alto­
gether on environmental grounds. The new top was variously called an 
"ecology" top and an "environmental can end," the former term being 
especially popular in the 1970s. Reynolds Aluminum Company promoted 
its new stay-on-tab can end the way most new technologies are intro­
duced-by comparing it with what it improved upon. However, also like 
most novel technologies, the way the new can top worked was not nec­
essarily obvious to the potential customer, and so early promotional cans

were imprinted with instructions for opening in much the same way the 
first cans intended to be opened with a church key had carried printed 
instructions. 
Before the idea of the new product could be effectively sold to beverage 
companies, however, they wanted to know how the consumer might 
receive it. Thus, Reynolds Aluminum conducted consumer studies of the 
new can design in ten supermarkets in Fort Pierce, Florida, and a control 
study in a similar market in Cocoa, Florida, where only conventional cans 
were available. By asking purchasers of the new-style cans to rate them in 
various categories, Reynolds concluded that the stay-on-tab had "over­
come the major disadvantage of . . .  the throw away tab. Stay-on-Tab is 
perceived to be better for the ecology." This and other positive compara­
tive results led to company to be optimistic about "the design's viability 
and potential for future success." 
In the sixteen years following the issuance of Cudzik's patent, which 
included much legal maneuvering regarding patent infringement, almost 
a trillion such tabs have been manufactured by Reynolds and other 
companies licensed to use the idea. The stay-on-tabs alone amounted to 
over four million tons of aluminum that was recovered and recycled rather 
than discarded on roads and beaches to pose litter and safety hazards. The 
now-familiar tab opening on beverage cans, like all artifacts, has its short­
comings and fails to function as fault-free as one might imagine, but we 
have adapted to it, as we do to most artifacts, and use it almost unthink­
ingly. Because it is not perfect, there are likely to more than a few Frazes 
and Cudziks working on new inventions to remove the shortcomings of 
the old. 
No matter how the cans are opened, the waste produced by packaging 
each twelve-ounce portion of soda or beer in its own aluminum pressure 
vessel appears to be a terribly wasteful use of energy and other nonrenew­
able resources and a litter-producing practice to boot. From the introduc­
tion of the aluminum can, manufacturers recognized that in order to make 
their product competitive with their steel counterparts, they would need 
a steady and reliable source of the metal. Recycled cans are a most 
attractive and dependable source of supply. It is said that the recycling 
system is now so efficient that the aluminum in a used can may show up 
in a new one in as little as six weeks. More than six out of every ten 
aluminum cans are now being recycled, and so the aluminum used in 
the beverage industry may be considered, if not a renewable, at least a 
recoverable resource.

The cost of aluminum has been a major factor in driving engineers to 
find ways of making beverage cans as light as possible. This quest, known 
in the industry as "lightweighting," resulted in the average can weight 
being cut almost in half in the. period from the mid-l 970s to the early 
1990s. One obvious way to reduce a can's weight is, of course, to make 
its wall thinner. But there is a clear limit to how thin a can can be, to be 
both strong enough when closed to contain the pressure' and stiff enough 
when opened to be able to be held comfortably in the hand. Thus, 
alternative ways of lightweighting the can were sought. 
Among the most effective means of reducing weight was in reducing 
the size of the can top. Because a top must be thicker than a can's body 
to maintain strength after being scored and riveted, the top takes a 
disproportionate amount of aluminum to fabricate. Thus, in the mid­
l 970s, can manufacturers began to narrow the can body ever so slightly 
in order to employ a smaller-diameter top. Since the area of a can top is 
proportional to the diameter squared, a small decrease in diameter re­
sulted in a substantial reduction in aluminum used. However, the can 
body cannot be narrowed too much, or else it would not feel right in the 
drinker's hand. To keep the can body sized for comfortable use and to 
maintain familiar proportions, the body began to be tapered at the top so 
that a smaller top could be fitted to it. By the late 1980s, this tapering had 
become very pronounced, but it could only be taken so far without 
making the can look too unconventional or be too difficult to drink from. 
Furthermore, there was the need to have the top diameter large enough 
to incorporate a tab opening. 
With can lightweighting by reducing top diameter reaching a practical 
limit, can manufacturers began to look for other ways to reduce the 
amount of aluminum needed to make a can, and they returned to the 
problem of reducing wall thickness. A new wall design, fluted like a 
classical column, was at first considered for aesthetic reasons. When it 
was found also to increase the strength of the can by 20 percent, it was 
looked to as a new means of reducing can weight by as much as 10 
percent. The fluted can did not seem to fare well in the marketplace, 
however, and its appearance in the mid-l 990s was short lived. 
In 1996 Coca-Cola announced a new can shape that seems to sacrifice 
lightweighting for the sake of appearance. The new contoured aluminum 
can with a wavy body and a larger diameter top was designed to evoke 
the shape of the classic green-glass Coca-Cola bottle. The can's faceted 
sides gave it strength against the pressure within, and the contour of its 
I N V E N T I O N  BY 
D E S I G N

body enabled the can to be held with a lighter grip by a drinker. A similarly 
contoured can, but larger and made of a steel body with an aluminum 
pop-top, was introduced years earlier in Japan to contain Sapporo beer, 
which Japanese consumers were accustomed to drinking from bottles. In 
spite of its untraditional shape, the Sapporo can was not well received in 
Japan, and it is now used only for export. Whether the new Coca-Cola 
aluminum can succeeds will depend similarly upon cultural factors. 
Engineering has many dimensions, but the idea of failure spreads 
across all of them. Understanding how a can may fail to work structurally 
as a pressure vessel is only one aspect of the engineering problem associ­
ated with manufacturing and distributing beverages in light, inexpensive, 
convenient containers. By appreciating how these containers may also fail 
to function aesthetically, environmentally, ergonomically, or in any other 
way, we can better understand the multifarious arenas in which engineer­
ing problems must be conceived and attacked.

The technical development of a reliable zipper took pure and persistent 
engineering, supported by the financial backing of loyal and patient 
investors. Many inventions have survived equally difficult and uncertain 
gestation periods, complicated in large part by the fact that they could 
not just be introduced into a marketplace that was not prepared for them. 
Thus, the light bulb was of no use without a reliable and effective supply 
of electricity upon which its operation so clearly depended. Indeed, it was 
Thomas Edison's recognition that a light bulb filament had to have a high 
electrical resistance in order to keep down the cost of the power supply 
network into which it would be plugged that led him to look for a proper 
filament material. He tested and discarded thousands of potential materi­
als before coming up with the right combination of electrical resistance 
and incandescence. When asked why he was not discouraged by the string 
of failures, Edison is said to have responded that, rather than discouraging 
him, each failure spurred him on with the new information that another 
material did not work and so could be disregarded. 
The automobile, no matter how well engineered and technically ad­
vanced, would not be a very effective vehicle were it not for the network 
of roads, including the bridges and tunnels carrying them over water and 
through mountains, that developed along with the horseless carriage. 
Imagine how different a machine the automobile would have to be if 
there were not a string of gasoline stations across the country. And imagine 
televisions without broadcast or cable networks. Such contexts, which 
develop along with inventions and in which inventions develop into 
innovations, involve systems and infrastructure which shape technology 
and its use. Indeed, after a while the individual artifacts and the supporting 
infrastructures become so interdependent that the one no longer can be 
considered without the other. Thus, airplanes are pretty much useless 
without airports, and who would have thought of building airports if there 
104 

were no airplanes. Of course, what exactly constitutes an airport at any 
stage in the airplane's development could be a matter of definition. The 
sandy beaches at Kitty Hawk effectively constituted an airport for the 
Wright Brothers. 
What comes first in the development of technological systems can 
clearly be a chicken and egg question. In the case of the airplane, once 
there is a costly network of airports and a complex system of reserving 
seats on scheduled airline flights between them, technical changes in the 
airplane itself cannot be made without considering the entire system in 
which it operates. It would be as foolish, for example, if aeronautical 
engineers proceeded to develop new energy-efficient jumbo jets that 
required runways three times as long as existing ones or airport terminals 
with much greater capacity than they currently have. It would be equally 
foolish for new airports to be designed with runways shorter or waiting 
areas smaller than those required by existing aircraft. 
Technology is the catch-all term used to describe objects and the 
networks, systems, and infrastructures in which they are embedded, as 
well as the patterns of use that we impose upon them and they upon us. 
Technology is clearly context-dependent and ever evolving, and engineers 
play a central role in influencing how it develops. Engineers design the 
basic parts into functioning artifacts, and they also necessarily become 
involved in designing the supporting networks and systems. Merely having 
an idea, patenting it, and securing financial backing is almost never 
enough to ensure that an invention will become part of current technol­
ogy; invariably a further engineering effort is required to bring a concept 
to usable reality, as case study after case study reveals. Thus we might say 
that engineers not only affect but effect technological development. 
This is not to say that engineers control technology or are totally 
responsible for its being what it has been, is now, or will become, but they 
clearly are in the middle of the action from start to finish. Every artifact 
and technical breakthrough has a history that illuminates the general 
nature of this engineering endeavor, and we can fully understand why a 
thing looks and works the way it does only by understanding its develop­
ment in the context of its times, technology, and culture.

The now-ubiquitous fax machine presents an interesting case study of the 
importance of context. Clearly, sending a fax is a meaningful thing to do 
only if there is a compatible fax machine at the receiving end. The idea 
F A C S I M I L E 
A N D  N E T W O R K S

for transmitting written, printed, or graphical material over long distances 
is not new, as demonstrated by such ancient notions as winged messengers 
and carrier pigeons and the more סodern concept of the postal system. 
With the discovery of electrical. phenomena and the invention of the 
telegraph and, later, the telephone, the transmission of words and word 
pictures through other than an animal or mechanical medium became a 
reality. Indeed, in the second half of the nineteenth century telegraphic 
messages could be carried over transoceanic cables between hemispheres. 
Telegraph offices served as terminals to and from which young messengers 
like Pittsburgh's Andrew Carnegie carried printed documents. A message 
was encoded, transmitted, decoded, and put into paper form again for 
delivery by other messengers to their ultimate destination. The clear 
advantages of transmitting words in such a way was obvious to everyone, 
and especially to inventors. It was also obvious that one of the system's 
greatest shortcomings was that pictures and graphical materials could not 
be transmitted directly. Such limitations of a technology sow the seeds of 
invention. 
The story of the development of the modern fax machine is a long and 
instructive one. In 1843 a British patent for a method to transmit images 
electrically was granted to a Scoעs clockmaker named Alexander Bain. 
Bain was a prolific inventor who perfected the electric clock in 1840 and 
devised the inked typewriter ribbon in 1841. His inventive interest in 
both the electric telegraph and the synchronized electric clock prepared 
him to see how to combine their features into a pair of devices that could 
send and receive graphical material. As with the early versions of many 
inventions, Bain's facsimile machine was crude by today's standards. The 
graphical material to be transmitted had to be prepared as a raised image 
on a metal block, much the way the reverse images of letters are raised 
from typewriter keys. A stylus was passed over the block and rose and fell 
in conformity with the raised image, thus breaking and completing the 
transmission circuit (Fig. 6. 1 ). A synchronized stylus on the receiving 
machine was then raised and lowered to reproduce the image. By incre­
mentally repositioning the transmission block in a second direction, the 
entire image could in time be reproduced. Bain's basic idea of scanning 
an image is preserved in modern fax machines, but the clear disadvantages 
of his first efforts drove subsequent inventors to seek ways of simplifying 
his cumbersome machines and reducing the effort needed to prepare 
images for transmission. 
Among the first improvements was to replace the bulky, costly, and

Alexander Bain's nineteenth-century facsimile machine 
difficult-to-prepare metal plates with tinfoil on which the image to be 
transmitted was drawn in ink. As the stylus passed systematically over the 
tinfoil, the current through the circuit was altered, and so the information 
could be transmitted electronically, to be recreated a line at a time on 
treated paper by a stylus incorporated into the receiving circuit. The first 
commercial facsimile system employing such a technique comprised a 
pair of machines installed in Paris and Lyons in 1865 by Abbe Caselli. 
No less an inventor than Thomas Edison was interested in improving the 
new technology, and he attacked the important problem of keeping the 
sending and receiving styluses in phase and synchronized by employ­
ing elaborate gearing and electromagnetic pendulums at each machine, 
F A C S I M I L E 
A N D  N E T W O R K S  
107 

which could be set in synchronized motion at the beginning of each 
transmission. 
One of the limitations of using styluses was that they were principally 
on-off devices. This was fine for- transmitting line drawings and graphs, 
but it was not effective in communicating the gradations of black and 
white that were contained in photographs, and so their images could not 
effectively be sent electronically. Near the end of the nineteenth century, 
however, the photoelectric cell was developed, and this enabled photo­
graphic images to be scanned and converted into a spectrum of electronic 
signals, thus transmitting shades of gray. As an added advantage, images 
could be sent faster, and Arthur Korn, a Gºrman inventor, first demon­
strated the technique successfully in 1902. The transmission of photo­
graphs electronically had an obvious commercial appeal to newspapers, 
who were thus willing to invest in the new technology, and a wirephoto 
circuit was established by 191 1 to connect offices in Berlin, London, and 
Paris. Networks were established in Europe and the United States after 
World War I, and transatlantic transmission of photographs was estab­
lished in the 1920s. In the early 1930s, the New York Times supported the 
work of the inventor Austin Cooley, who was developing a fax machine 
that was small enough to be carried by an individual to transmit news 
pictures via ordinary telephone lines. 
One of the weak links in the chain of any newspaper publishing 
enterprise is the printing and distribution network. The latter is especially 
capital and labor intensive because of the fleet of trucks and army of 
workers it requires to get the news delivered before it is stale. Newspapers 
have always been vulnerable to being shut down by strikes of printers and 
truckers, and a technological means of circumventing that had a clear 
appeal to publishers. The promise of being able to transmit facsimiles of 
newspapers around the clock to radio receivers in homes and offices led 
to the establishment by 1940 of 40 stations sending out experimen­
tal newspapers via ultra-high-frequency transmission. These experiments 
were interrupted by World War II, and the emergence of television in the 
wake of the war led to the abandonment of commercial fax broadcasting 
by newspapers. 
There were obvious wartime advantages to having fax machines for 
sending such documents as terrain and weather maps, as well as photo­
graphs, to front lines, and so the military continued to be a viable market 
for the technology. Among the few commercial efforts that succeeded in 
the 1950s was that of Western Union, which sold Desk-Fax units that could 
I N V E N T I O N  BY D E S I G N  
108 

send and receive telegrams without requiring anyone to leave the office. 
This technology was attractive only to those customers whose business 
volume justified investing in the equipment, however. 
The very first telegrams had to be sent by Morse Code and decoded 
by a human ear and recorded by a human hand at the receiving end. The 
teletypewriter was developed to automate the typing of incoming mes­
sages, and early versions produced a continuous line of text on a paper 
tape. This was cut into lengths that could be pasted on the familiar yellow 
Western Union telegram forms that can be seen in old movies. Teletype­
writers evolved into instruments that could be used also to send messages, 
and by incorporating such features as line-end functions into the key­
board, messages were received in a form more akin to a typed page. Telex, 
short for Teletypewriter Exchange Service (TWX in another version), was 
a system that employed telephone lines as multichannel conduits to 
transmit data between teletypewriters. This now largely superseded tech­
nology retains a vestigial presence on some business letterheads that 
continue to list Western Union Telex or TWX addresses, especially those 
which were aptly personalized, such as the Telex address CIVILS for the 
British Institution of Civil Engineers. The Telex and TWX services were 
combined in 1970, but not long thereafter fax numbers began to be added 
to letterheads, in most cases replacing the numbers and letters of the older 
technology. 
Facsimile transmission, albeit relatively crude and slow, was thus well 
established in specialized uses long before fax machines became the 
familiar instruments they are today. It is instructive to understand why 
a century of engineering and technological advances were not alone 
sufficient to give the system a more widespread presence. After all, type­
writers and telephones were also crude by today's standards, and yet they 
pervaded places of business of all sizes and in all locations.

Among the reasons fax machines were not more widely incorporated into 
offices earlier than they might have been, at least in America, has to do 
with the available communications infrastructure that had developed in 
the early twentieth century. The telephone system consisted of effective 
monopolies, with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company con­
trolling large networks of phones and phone lines. Customers did not even 
own their telephones but rather leased them from AT&T, or what was 
known as the Bell System, and nothing but the phone company's instru-
F A C S I M I L E  A N D  N E T W O R K S  
109 

ments could be attached to their lines. In the 1930s AT&T decided not 
to pursue the development of wirephoto or other facsimile transmission 
services over its lines, and since AT&T was a monopoly, this natural 
infrastructure for transmitting data was not readily available to inde­
pendent inventors or engineers or to other companies. This is why news­
papers used UHF radio waves as a transmitting medium in their earlier 
experiment. In the late 1960s the Federal Communicatiohs Commission, 
which regulated telephone networks in the United States, decided to allow 
non-Bell system equipment to use the established public switched tele­
phone network (known in the industry as PSTN). Similar deregulation 
occurred in the early 1970s in Japan, which meant that facsimile trans­
mission now had an intercontinental communication infrastructure avail­
able for its use. Hence, electronics companies and their engineers began 
to work with renewed interest on the development of improved fax ma­
chines that could be linked through the PSTN via acoustic couplers over 
which analog data was transmitted much as the voice was. 
Competition had its downside, however. Growing numbers of electron­
ics companies, driven by free access to the telephone network, soon 
introduced a plethora of new equipment that was not readily compatible 
with the other equipment on the market. This was clearly not a desirable 
development, for businesses who wished to invest in fax machines wanted 
to be able to send faxes to every other business with a fax machine, and 
yet communication between any two independently purchased units was 
not unlike a return to the earliest fax technology in which machines that 
were not paired in design did not work. 
The dissemination of technology in a free market cannot proceed very 
effectively if each manufacturer works in total disregard of all the others. 
Purchasers and users like to be able to mix and match products and 
components for maximum convenience. When a new technology is being 
introduced, however, it is not uncommon for different manufacturers to 
be pursuing similar but different ways of dealing with the technical details. 
The first light bulbs, for example, did not have standardized bases, but 
now we expect different brands to be made with the same screw base so 
that they can be used interchangeably. Likewise, we can buy pencil leads 
by diameter and not worry about whether 0.5 mm Scripto leads will fit 
into a Pentel mechanical pencil, and vice versa. Such developments come 
about because manufacturers oflike products agree to manufacture stand­
ard sizes and meet common performance criteria. When such agreements

On the numberpad of virtually every hand-held calculator

do not arise voluntarily, government regulatory agencies might get in­
volved in developing what are known as standards. 
Unlike problems in mathematics, which practically always have a 
unique answer, a single problem- in engineering and technology can have 
many different solutions. Thus, there are many different ways of providing 
portable power for electronic devices, and hence we hףve a plethora of 
batteries with different physical sizes and configurations, not to mention 
voltage output. Though this can be a great annoyance when trying to buy 
replacement batteries for a portable calculator, it is unlikely that the 
situation could easily be remedied, for it is unreasonable to require the 
various successful calculator companies to redesign their products around 
a single battery. While stores that sell batteries would certainly wish there 
were fewer kinds to stock, the large numbers that have evolved do take 
up relatively little space. And so the problem of having to deal with so 
many batteries is more of an annoyance than a big issue. 
Video tapes of movies, by contrast, are more expensive than batteries, 
and they take up a relatively large amount of space to stock. In the early 
1980s, two separate types of video cassette recorder (VCR) were compet­
ing for control of the market: Beta and VHS. The cassette used in Beta 
VCRs was over an inch shorter. in length than the VHS cassette, with 
other dimensions smaller also, which meant that the VHS cassette was 
about 30 percent larger by volume. There was general agreement at the 
time that Beta technology could give better picture quality, but Sony did 
not license anyone else to use its patented Beta technology and thus more 
VHS recorders were sold by more different companies. In time it became 
much easier to find the VHS version of movies and other tapes in video 
rental stores, and it became the standard. Consumers also wanted to be 
able to exchange tapes with one another, and generally they did not want 
to have to deal with questions of compatibility. The less popular Beta was 
essentially driven out of the marketplace, and by the late 1980s a videotape 
cassette and a VCR in which to insert it essentially meant VHS technol­
ogy, at least in the United States.

Fax machines have an obvious need to communicate with one another. 
A given corporation could specify that all of its offices use the same brand 
of fax so that communications could flow smoothly among them, but 
communication across company lines would be impeded if fax machines 
were not compatible. Such compatibility would come if the different fax

manufacturers agreed to common specifications, and the first standards 
for fax transmission were in place as early as 1968. Since communicat­
ing by fax, like telephoning, was an international issue, the United Na­
tions, through its International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative 
Committee (known by the letters CCITT, because the official name in 
French is Comite Consultatif International Telegraphique et Telepho­
nique ) , promulgated the standards, which specified an analog frequency­
modulation transmission scheme. According to the 1968 standard, an 
8 l /2 by 1 1-inch page of information was expected to be transmitted 
within six minutes with a resolution of 100 dots per inch both horizontally 
and vertically. 
While technical standards spell out minimum expectations at the time 
the standard is written, they do not limit the levels of performance that 
manufacturers can seek. All technological artifacts evolve as new ways are 
discovered and developed for removing limitations on existing technology. 
In the case of fax machines, some obvious limitations were the speed and 
resolution with which faxes could be sent, not to mention the high cost 
of some of the early machines. As engineers continued to work on such 
problems to give their company's fax machines an advantage over the 
competition, the 1968 standards became too modest. The class of fax 
machines that met only those standards came to be known as Group l 
machines. In 1976 Group 2 machines were defined as those meeting a 
more severe standard, one in which analog transmission time at the same 
1 00 by 100 resolution was only three minutes. 
American manufacturers of analog fax machines were not totally 
pleased with their sales in the late 1970s. They did not expect that a great 
deal of capital investment in a new technology would pay off very well, 
and so they chose not to pursue the development of digital fax technology 
the way the Japanese did. The situation was not unlike the way some 
American pencil manufacturers deliberately chose not to pursue the 
development of fine-line mechanical pencil technology, although in that 
case it was not just a question of return on investment, for it was feared 
that the newer product might compete with the established wood-cased 
pencil market. Thus, Japanese firms developed the American-invented 
technology, and eventually virtually all fine-line mechanical pencils sold 
in America were made in Japan. Paradoxically, though the new Japanese­
made mechanical pencils were tremendously popular, their adoption did 
not significantly diminish wood-cased pencil sales. 
In the case of fax machines, the Japanese were more motivated than 
F A C S I M I L E 
A N D  N E T W O R K S  
1 1 3 

Americans to develop digital technology not just for marketing but for 
cultural reasons, because the multiplicity of phonetic symbols and ideo­
graphic characters in Japanese were not easily coded for transmission via 
telegraph and telex systems. Among the first to see this potential in the 
Japanese and Chinese markets had been Thomas Edison, and it had 
motivated his own early research on the fax machine. . 
By the 1970s the world's largest facsimile research laboratory was well 
established under the auspices of Japan's national telephone company. To 
promote a national fax industry, the Japanese government forced manu­
facturers to adopt a communications standard that was common for 
domestic and international telephone operations, funded research, and 
purchased the resulting products. By 1980 the CCITI put forth standards 
for Group 3 fax machines, in which digital encoding compresses the data 
to be transmitted, thus bringing the typical transmission time for a page 
to under a minute. The new standard resolution became 200 dots per 
inch horizontally and 100 vertically, with a fine resolution option of 200 
by 200 dots per inch. Details regarding session protocol, known as "hand­
shaking," which establishes how the data are to be transmitted between 
two machines, were also included in the new standard, and by the late 
1980s convenient digital fax technology was well established and growing 
at an enormous rate. 
Not only were Group 3 fax machines better at universal communica­
tion but they also were easier and more pleasant to use. Digital and 
computer chip technology had automated much of the work of estab­
lishing the communication protocol between sending and receiving faxes, 
and thermal printing enabled a relatively inexpensive and odor-free paper 
to replace the expensive and smelly paper that were common in analog 
machines. These technological developments made fax machines, which 
had frequently been relegated to mailrooms and operated by designated 
employees, more acceptable and used out in the open by everyone in 
offices everywhere. Indeed, since the newer fax machines, especially the 
more expensive office models that used plain paper, employed so much 
technology that was similar to that in a copier machine, in a pinch fax 
machines could double as convenient copiers. 
S O C I A L  A N D  C U LT U R A L  F A C T O R S  
Among other significant factors that accelerated the acceptance and use 
of fax machines were some that might be termed extratechnological or 
social. By the mid-l 980s, thanks in part to some very effective television 
I N V E N T I O N  BY 
D E S I G N

commercials and advertising campaigns, Federal Express had grown into 
a ubiquitous overnight delivery service. Indeed, the term Fedex came to 
be used almost generically for all speedy delivery services. In 1984, before 
every office had its own fax machine, the Federal Express organization 
invested heavily in a faxing service it called ZapMail, whereby faxed 
copies of documents could be delivered at unheard of speeds. Ironically, 
Federal Express's promotion of fax technology was so effective in selling 
the idea of faxing documents that the biggest potential customers bought 
their own fax machines and made the service unnecessary. Federal Ex­
press lost over $300 million in the venture, but its enormous success in 
overnight delivery enabled it to survive even such a large loss. 
Another phenomenon of the 1980s that is widely believed to have 
influenced the rapid adoption of fax technology was the growing dissatis­
faction with postal services. People were complaining more and more 
about how conventional mail (now derisively called "snail mail" by ardent 
e-mail users) was getting slower and less dependable. Letters were said to 
be lost and never delivered. At the same time, the presence and use of 
photocopying machines in offices had made office workers increasingly 
familiar with the concept of feeding documents into a copier and pressing 
a few buttons to begin the process. Many newer fax machines were 
remarkably like office copiers in their looks and operation, and so they 
were less intimidating to use and there was less resistance to their intro­
duction into the office routine. Faxing a letter was just like long-distance 
photocopying. By 1987, for the first time, fax machines exported from 
Japan exceeded that country's domestic consumption of them. Further­
more, over the course of about a decade, from 1980 to 1992, the cost of 
digital fax machines dropped by a factor of 30, thus making them afford­
able by the smallest of businesses and even by individuals. 
Over 600 different varieties of fax machines were available to the 
consumer by the early 1990s. In the United States alone the market for 
fax machines grew from half a million in 198 5 to 6 million by 1991. 
By the mid 1990s, personal computers were commonly being equipped 
with fax boards, which made it unnecessary to print out a computer­
generated document before faxing it to someone who might then have 
to enter its data into another computer. Computer-to-computer faxes thus 
promised to reduce the amount of paper generated in offices, some­
thing the personal computer itself and the fax machine had not suc­
ceeded in doing. Estimates are that the number of pages transmitted via 
fax rose from 1 . 5  billion in 1985 to 17 billion in 1991, an increase of an 
F A C S I M I L E 
A N D  N E T W O R K S

order of magnitude in only six years. As much as 40 percent of telephone 
traffic between the United States and Japan was estimated to involve fax 
transmissions. 
F U RT H E R  D E V E L O P M E N T S  I N  F A X  M A C H I N E S 
Both mechanical and electrical engineers, working individually and in 
groups on various aspects of the machine, played important roles in the 
development of the fax from a clumsy, slow analog device that used smelly 
paper to the compact, fast, and user-friendly machines that became as 
familiar as copier machines and telephones. In the early 1990s, for exam­
ple, a group of Hitachi researchers and' engineers wrote a paper on 
"compacting technologies for small size personal facsimile," which ap­
peared in the Transactions on Consumer Electronics of the Institute of 
Electrical and Electronics Engineers. The six authors, led by a senior 
researcher whose name, Toyota Honda, suggested more an automotive 
than a communications engineer, came from five different divisions of the 
company: Hitachi Research Laboratory, Image and Media System Labo­
ratory, Information System Equipment Operation, Telecommunication 
Division, and Mechanical Engineering Research Laboratory. The paper 
reported on two developments that were found necessary to produce a 
"small size personal machine," one involving rollers, which is a clearly 
mechanical engineering problem, and the other involving a computer 
chip, a clearly electrical engineering problem. Since home faxes are also 
expected to double as copiers, the quality of the image produced was very 
important. 
Because a personal or home fax machine had to be inexpensive and 
small and yet produce a high-quality image, the mechanical engineering 
problem focused upon reducing the number of rollers and motors em­
ployed without significantly sacrificing printing quality. Larger machines 
contained two motors, one to drive the mechanism that handled a docu­
ment to be transmitted or copied, and another to operate the printing end 
of the machine for documents received and for producing copies (see Fig. 
6.2). The first motor drove three rollers, two of which served only to feed 
the document to the image sensor, which was located opposite a platen 
roller that played a much more central role in the process. The compact 
fax machine developed by the Hitachi engineers used only one roller to 
both feed and back up the image sensor, and a single motor was employed 
to drive both the input and output functions. Among the incidental 
problems that had to be addressed was the fact that a single roller with a

F I G U R E  6.2 Motor use in a personal fax machine 
surface rough enough to grab and feed a piece of paper also tended to 
collect dirt. The new single-roller arrangement was thus dirtier, which 
translated into image distortion. This required the development of a new 
electronic means of compensating for shading on the document being 
read, and mechanical and electrical engineers had to interact on its 
solution. 
Not surprisingly, the research paper of the Hitachi engineers does not 
reveal many of the details of how they ultimately solved their problems, 
but this is to be expected in an industry in which success depends so 
much on having a competitive product advantage. Industrial secrets can­
not last long or be effective indefinitely, however. As soon as the new 
Hitachi compact fax would be distributed, competing companies could

buy it as easily as consumers could. Engineers learn a lot about different 
ways of solving problems by taking things apart, an activity that many 
engineering students engaged in as children and many engineers con­
tinue to do throughout their lives. Trying to make a new machine by 
taking apart something of the competition's is known as reverse engineer­
ing, and it would have been immediately obvious that Ȇ big advance in 
the new Hitachi fax was its reduced number of motors and rollers. 
Understanding how the dirt problem was solved would take a little more 
work, but in time engineers working for competitors could figure it out, 
or at least understand the problem well enough to come up with an 
alternative and maybe even better solution: (If something is patented, of 
course, it cannot just be copied.) It is in such ways that competitive 
consumer products come to evolve into similar yet different forms. Be­
cause manufacturing companies know that their products are never safe 
from reverse engineering scrutiny-nor can they maintain their competi­
tive advantage for very long-research, development, and engineering 
groups are an essential component of an active industry. 
As the size and price of fax machines continued to be reduced, while 
reliability and quality of image seemed to, be constantly improving, the 
question of speed of transmission remained an issue, at least with some 
manufacturers and users. Increasingly sophisticated encoding schemes 
required less data to be transmitted and hence decreased the time it took 
to scan and send a page, but the limiting factor was the 9600 bits per 
second that could be carried over the public telephone networks. In fact, 
fax technology had become so sophisticated that when a machine de­
tected that it had gotten a noisy telephone connection, successively lower 
modem rates of 7200, 4800, and 2400 bits per second were automatically 
employed until one of these fallback speeds proved reliable. 
The question of transmission speed led to a new standard being intro­
duced in 1984, and faxes that fall within it are known as Group 4. In this 
category, fax machines are designed to communicate over the integrated­
services digital network known as ISON (see Fig. 6.3). However, ISON 
itself did not become as widely available as soon as originally expected, 
due largely to the fact that local telephone networks and switching ex­
changes were not yet upgraded to ISON capability. A decade later there 
were still relatively few Group 4 faxes operating. As with virtually all new 
technologies or technological advances, the situation attracted the atten­
tion of skeptics and nay-sayers and encouraged them to quip that ISON 
stood for "It Still Does Nothing" and "I Still Don't Need." Whether the

new technologies might be developed before the ISDN network becomes 
widespread and before the costs of Group 4 fax machines drop enough 
to make them fully competitive. By the mid-1990s there were promising 
developments that ISDN would indeed become the "Interface Subscrib­
ers Definitely Need." 
What new alternative technologies might be is not merely a technical 
question, as the case study of the fax itself makes clear. Even the most 
technically advanced problems have nontechnical components that affect 
their solution. Cultural, social, economic, and political developments can 
be limiting factors as much as the physical laws that govern electronic 
circuits and mechanical movements.

Like a lot of inventions, the tubojet airplane engine was developed more 
or less simultaneously and independently by different individuals in dif­
ferent parts of the world. In England, a young student named Frank 
Whittle became obsessed with the idea of employing jet propulsion in 
aircraft and wrote his graduate thesis on future developments in aircraft 
design. In 1930 Whittle applied for his first patent on the turbojet engine. 
In Germany, a few years later, another young researcher, Hans von Ohain, 
was encouraged by one of his professors to pursue interests in the jet 
engine. Whittle and von Ohain, initially with very little interest or support 
from their governments or military interests, led the development efforts 
in their respective countries, and jet fighter aircraft finally began to appear 
in the skies just as World War II was coming to a close. In 199 1 ,  for their 
determined efforts that ultimately changed the nature of aircraft world­
wide, Whittle and von Ohain were named the second recipients of the 
prestigious Draper Prize by the National Academy of Engineering. (The 
first Draper Prize, awarded in 1989, went to Jack S. Kilby and Robert N. 
Noyce for their independent roles in inventing and developing the inte­
grated circuit, which has revolutionized so much in the world, including 
air travel.) 
Postwar Germany was in no position to develop a commercial jet 
airplane, but the British were and did-for use in such promising, lucra­
tive, and revolutionary applications as economical long-range air travel, 
including transatlantic flights. The first commercial jet airline service, 
inaugurated on May 2, 1953, employed the jet-powered airplane known 
as the Comet, which was developed by the British de Havilland Aircraft 
Company. That manufacturer's distinct advantage in capturing the world 
aircraft market was short-lived, however, for exactly one year later a Comet 
exploded in midair while taking off from Calcutta. Within another year 
two other Comets suffered fatal midair failures, and the plane's design

Reconstruction of a failed de Havilland Comet 
came under serious investigation. Pilot error and bad weather were at first 
blamed for the accidents, but eventually the cause was identified as metal 
fatigue. Small cracks that developed in the highly-stressed corners of an 
opening in the plane's fuselage grew slowly but surely with each cycle 
from take-off to landing until they were so large that, when pressurized 
on the fatal flights, the plane shattered explosively and without warning 
(see Fig. 7. 1). 
Metal fatigue was a new phenomenon in aircraft. Before the introduc­
tion of jets, airplanes did not fly so high and thus did not have to be 
so highly pressurized for passenger comfort. In order to gain the fuel 
A I R P L A N E S  A N D  C O M P U T E R S  
1 2 1  

efficiency that gave the new engine part of its advantage, jets had to fly 
higher than propeller-driven airplanes, and as they did so the structural 
components of the aircraft were subjected to conditions that were beyond 
the experience of its designers. Previously, metal fatigue was believed to 
affect only machine parts that were subjected to cycles numbering in the 
hundreds of thousands, if not millions. Therefore, the Comet's engineers 
did not believe that fatigue would affect the plane, יhich would be 
subjected to far fewer cycles during its lifetime. But because airplanes 
must be as light as possible, their structural parts must carry more intense 
loads than the parts ofland-based structures or machines, for which weight 
is less important. The critical combination of load intensity and flight 
cycles that would lead to the growth of critical cracks proved to be far 
lower than expected in the Comet. 
The stresses, or intensity of force, to which a pressurized aircraft fuse­
lage is subjected are not unlike those that an aluminum beverage can 
must resist. Thus, as a first approximation, the main body of the airplane 
may be thought of as a cylindrical pressure vessel. Since aluminum 
beverage cans generally are not subjected to widely varying cycles of 
pressurization and depressurization, fatiguך is not a problem to be con­
sidered in beverage can design (though the phenomenon of metal fatigue 
can be easily demonstrated on an aluminum can by bending the top 
opening device back and forth several times). However, the airplane 
fuselage-which alternates between no net pressure difference between 
inside and outside when it is on the ground with its doors open to a large 
net internal pressure when it is flying at altitude in a rarified atrnosphere­
is subject to fatigue. Its metal skin can withstand only so many cycles of 
alternating stresses created by this repeated change of net pressure, the 
way the aluminum beverage can tab is able to withstand only so many 
cycles of being bent back and forth. 
Because it took some time even to suspect that metal fatigue was 
causing the Comet crashes, and more time to correct the design flaw, the 
plane lost the confidence of the flying public, as did the airlines that flew 
it. As the British aircraft industry lost the advantage of having the first 
commercial jet airplane, other aircraft companies, especially in the United 
States, including Boeing, Lockheed, McDonnell, and Douglas (the latter 
two of which merged in 1967 to form the McDonnell-Douglas Corpora­
tion), began to develop their own models of jet aircraft. Their engineers 
had the advantage of learning from the failure of the Comet that metal 
fatigue was a major design consideration, and thus in the development of 
I N V E N T I O N  BY 
D E S I G N  
1 22 

their own planes they could take special care to avoid the conditions of 
dangerously high alternating stresses in the fuselage. 
Over the years, the Boeing Company came to dominate the world 
market for commercial jet aircraft, based largely on the successful devel­
opment of its highly reliable 707 airplane. As air travel increased world­
wide and as fuel prices became an increasingly large factor in the cost of 
operating an airplane, a variety of competing commercial jet aircraft were 
developed that provided a range of passenger capacity along with more 
fuel-efficient operating characteristics. Among these were the familiar 
DC-9 and Boeing 727 and, later, the wide-bodied aircraft such as the 
DC-10, L-10 1 1 ,  and Boeing 747. 
Yet as early as the mid-l 970s the American-dominated commercial 
aircraft industry began to be challenged by the European-based Airbus 
lndustrie, a consortium of companies highly subsidized by the British, 
French, German, and Spanish governments. By the mid-l 980s Airbus had 
begun to make significant headway into the world commercial airplane 
market, and in order to keep competitive in such a market, an aircraft 
company had to look constantly to the future to anticipate what kinds of 
planes would be desired by airlines as patterns of air travel would change 
with a changing world economy. In the late twentieth century, this meant 
paying special attention to what was happening in developing countries, 
especially those around the Pacific Rim. It was in this environment that, 
in the mid- to late-l 980s Boeing began to look to designing and developing 
a new airplane that would fill needs that planes like its 747 and 767 did 
not (see Fig. 7.2). The new airplane design they decided to pursue 
became known as the 777. 
C O N C E P T U A L  D E S I G N  
The design of a new airplane, like the design of anything else, begins at 
the conceptual or schematic stage; for until certain basic ideas are decided 
upon and put on paper or the computer screen, there can be little to 
discuss among the team members whose job is to carry out the detailed 
design that will result in a real object. Boeing's interest in developing a 
new airplane was at first market-driven: the company wanted to create a 
product that, in size, would fill a gap between the 747 and the DC-10 
and L-101 1 of the competition-aircraft that were aging and would even­
tually have to be replaced. Since it was an established fact in the aircraft 
industry that a new airplane took at least four years and a large financial 
investment to design, develop, assemble, test, and produce for sale, getting

Chart comparing aircraft seating capacity and range of various commer­
cial jets 
started well before airlines would have to make replacement decisions was 
good business. 
In the 19 50s an airplane like the 707 cost a bout $ 1 5  million to develop 
and test; by the mid-l 980s designing and developing a totally new airplane 
was expected to take billions of dollars, thus risking the very life of the 
company on the venture. At first Boeing looked to stretching its existing 
767 design as a safe, quick, and low-cost way of providing a plane with 
increased seating capacity. Developing a stretch version of an existing 
aircraft is relatively easy, in that sections of fuselage are added before and 
after the wing, thus altering in a minimal way the location of the center 
of gravity and the aerodynamics of the basic design. The new airplane 
was referred to as a 767-X, connoting the fact that it was a version of the 
then-familiar and reliable 767, which had a capacity of about 200 passen­
gers, more or less, depending upon its configuration. In the meantime, 
however, McDonnell-Douglas was introducing its new 323-seat MD-1 1, 
which was a modernized DC-10 with fuel-efficient engines and was 
expected to be available in 1990. In addition, Airbus was expected to be 
I N V E N T I O N  BY D E S I G N  
1 24 

delivering its new 300-seat four-engine A-340 in 1992, and a year later the 
slightly larger capacity but twin-engined A-330 model, which would also 
have a longer range. 
Boeing came to believe that, with such competition on the horizon, 
the better marketing strategy would be to develop an airplane that could 
compete more directly with other new products. Thus, in late 1988 the 
company decided that it would offer an entirely new airplane, the 777. 
Conceiving of a new airplane, on the one hand, and committing the 
corporation to designing and developing it, on the other, were actions that 
were about $4 billion apart. In the aircraft industry a firm commitment 
to go ahead with detailed design development does not take place until 
there is a commitment by a customer to buy a certain number of the new 
planes. Almost two years elapsed before United Airlines became Boeing's 
"launch customer," which meant that the manufacturer could announce 
its firm multibillion-dollar financial commitment to going ahead full 
speed with the project. Thus the Boeing 777 was launched in late 1990, 
into a market in which dozens of airlines had already ordered hundreds 
of MD-1 ls, A-340s, and A-330s. 
As part of a marketing strategy to catch up with the competition, Boeing 
invited eight American and overseas airlines to get involved with the 
design of the plane in its early conceptual design stage, when few things 
were firmly decided upon and so changes were easily made to suit the 
customer. The airlines included, besides the launch customer United, 
All-Nippon, American, British, Cathay Pacific, Delta, Japan, and Qantas, 
and they met with Boeing engineers over the course of a year to express 
their desires. While no one expected such a diverse group of customers 
(which had come to be known collectively as the "Gang of Eight") to 
agree on what would be the ideal airplane, enough points of consensus 
were reached to fix a design concept that could serve as the basis for 
detailed engineering work. Among the clearest points of agreement was 
that the width of the fuselage should be greater than that of either the 
MD-1 1 or the new Airbus models. 
The size of an airplane's fuselage, like the span of a bridge, is the kind 
of conceptual design decision that has far-reaching technical and cost 
implications for the project. Only after such dimensions are set can 
detailed and interrelated calculations involving strength, weight, aerody­
namic properties, power requirements, and the like be made. For example, 
the stress developed in the fuselage structure that holds each section of 
A I R P L A N E S  A N D  C O M P U T E R S  
1 2 5  

pressurized cabin together is directly related to the cabin's diameter, as is 
the drag the aircraft will experience. in flight. Greater stress requirements 
mean greater amounts or stronger structural materials must be used, 
which translates into more weight or cost. A heavier plane requires more 
power to move, which translates into more total engine thrust. Alterna­
tively, of course, the passenger capacity of the plane can be reduced, but 
this goes against the primary reason to have a wider cכbin, namely, to 
carry more passengers. In short, the decision of how wide an airplane's 
cabin will be must be fixed early in the design process-at the conceptual 
design stage-because so much else about the design depends upon that 
single dimension. 
Paradoxically, by starting behind the competition, Boeing could have 
an advantage over it. Since potential customers found fault with the cabin 
widths of the planes with which Boeing wished to compete, it decided to 
make the inside cabin width at armrest level about five inches wider than 
that in the MD-1 1 and about twenty-five inches wider than that in the 
A-330 and A-340. This translated into a flexibility of seating arrangements 
that could mean as many as 30 additional seats and paying passengers per 
plane. Another problem that airlines found with a lot of existing aircraft 
was the design and arrangement of overhead storage bins. When Boeing 
presented a design for overhead compartments that increased headroom 
when they were closed but opened in such a way that even shorter 
passengers could gain access, the Gang of Eight were unanimously in 
favor of incorporating the bins into the 777, even though some of the 
engineers argued that the bins were harder to manufacture and added 
weight to the aircraft. Such tradeoffs are always encountered in engineer­
ing design, however, and what is the "best" design decision is not always 
determined by technical considerations alone; in this case passenger 
satisfaction was assigned a high priority. 
American Airlines proposed a more far-reaching design feature, 
prompted by the fact that the required wingspan of the 777 was esti­
mated to be roughly 200 feet, or about 45 feet longer than that of the 
DC-10. This would mean that the 777 would not fit into existing airport 
gates without sacrificing capacity or flexibility. Since airports were already 
crowded, giving up gate space was not an attractive option, and the wider 
wingspan would also present problems on the relatively narrow taxiways 
of some older airports. American proposed that the 777 have wing tips 
that folded up for taxiing and gate parking (Fig. 7.3). This feature, though

Folding-wing design of Boeing 777 
familiar on military aircraft in order to conserve space on aircraft carriers, 
was new for commercial planes and was not without its drawbacks. On 
smaller fighter aircraft, there can be visual and manual inspection by the 
ground crew that the wing-locking mechanism was firmly engaged before 
takeoff. The size of a 777 would make such inspection difficult, and so 
elaborate safety features would have to be incorporated into the design 
and considerable precautions would also have to be taken to ensure that 
the wing-locking device would not accidently become unlocked while the 
plane was in flight. Furthermore, the structure and machinery to make 
the wings fold and lock would add considerable weight to the plane. 
Nevertheless, Boeing agreed to incorporate the folding-wing feature into 
the design so as not to lose future business owing to an inability of the 
777 to fit into the existing air transportation infrastructure. 
T R A D I T I O N A L  A I R C R A F T D E S I G N  
The traditional way of carrying out the detailed design of a new aircraft 
was for a lot of engineers and draftspersons to work individually and in 
teams on various parts and subsystems of the plane. In the 777 there were 
over 1 30,000 unique individual parts to be engineered and, when rivets 
A I R P L A N E S  A N D  C O M P U T E R S  
1 27 

and other fasteners are counted, over 3 million total parts to be assembled 
into each plane. The 747, which had a total of 4.5 million parts, required 
about 75,000 individual engineering drawings to specify. Of course, this 
great number of drawings all had. to be consistent with one another if the 
parts were to fit together and if the various cables, wires, and ducts were 
not to interfere with one another. To check that parts and systems were 
compatible, an engineer working on one part had to gef the drawings of 
mating parts, and any change that might have to be made in one area 
necessarily had sometimes fundamental implications for other parts or 
systems. It was a slow, arduous, and frustrating process, and one senior 
draftsperson at Boeing recalled "waiting for days to get someone else's 
drawing, getting a copy made, and slipping it under mine to trace their 
part." Even with careful checking and cross-checking, interferences and 
mismatches frequently occurred. 
To catch incompatibilities among systems, physical mockups were 
constructed in which all the tubing, wiring, ductwork, and the like were 
installed. If a tube had to pass through a duct, for example, a rerouting 
would have to be devised, which meant that all of the associated drawings 
would have to be revised as well. Physical mockups were expensive, 
labor-intensive, and time-consuming, and they added to the cost of the 
airplane. 
Another big problem associated with coordinating a great number of 
individual parts was that when it came time finally to assemble the actual 
airplanes, not everything fit quite exactly. Shims of one kind or another 
had to be inserted to smooth out the poor match of fuselage parts, even 
though they had been manufactured according to specifications. For 
example, the 747 contained about 1000 pounds of shims, which not only 
added to the cost and labor of the plane but also added unplanned-for 
dead weight. Boeing took extra care in the design of its 767 to reduce, if 
not eliminate, the necessity of shimming. 
The cost of additional change orders for parts after they have been 
specified by presumably "final" drawings is among the more difficult 
expenses to plan for in design and manufacturing. Furthermore, such 
changes add no new value to a product, and so their cost cannot be 
recovered by the manufacturer once a price for the aircraft has been set. 
Management approaches that go under such names as Total Quality 
Management (TQM) and, at Boeing, Continuous Quality Improvement 
(CQI) have aimed to avoid these costly mistakes by insisting on a high 
level of cooperation and effort throughout the entire design process.

To design the 777 as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible, while at 
the same time achieving high quality, Boeing chose a "paperless" design 
strategy. This meant that computers were to be used in the design, testing, 
and manufacturing process to a greater extent than ever before. Boeing's 
earlier limited experience with computer-aided design (CAD) consisted 
of designing an engine strut for the 767. That design was completed 
3112 months ahead of an allocated 24 months, and at a cost that was lower 
than estimated for then-conventional design methods. In addition, the 
number of expensive changes to the design subsequent to its being re­
leased was significantly lower than for other Boeing strut designs. The 
CAD system used for this impressive pilot program was a Computer Aided 
Three-dimensional Interactive Application (CATIA) developed by Das­
sault Systemes, a French-owned software development firm with close ties 
to IBM. 
Scaling up the CATIA system to enable it to handle the volume of data 
and number of users required to design the 777 entirely by computer was 
in itself a computer-engineering design problem of unprecedented mag­
nitude. The installation at Boeing's Everett, Washington, factory, the 
principal location for 777 design and assembly, was to have over 2000 
terminals (see Fig. 7.4) connected to eight of IBM's largest mainframe 
computers. At first the CATIA system was operated on ES/9000-720 
machines, but they were replaced with larger capacity ES/9000-900 units 
before the peak design demand that was expected to occur in 1992. Image 
manipulation, which is so important in CAD but which consumes so 
much computer memory, was done locally on IBM 5085 and 5086 
workstations. The total storage capacity required for the overall system 
reached a staggering 3.5 terabytes, which, if stored on high-density 3.5-
inch 1.44-megabyte disks, would require about 2.5 million of them, or a 
pile almost five miles high. 
As many as 238 teams, comprising as many as 40 engineers, were 
involved in the design, development, and manufacturing of the 777, and 
they all needed access to all of the computer data. A truly paperless design 
meant that, instead of waiting for physical drawings to be copied and 
checked for compatibility of parts and systems, an engineer working on a 
single part could call up all mating parts or systems into which it was to 
fit on any one of the over 7000 workstations that were eventually spread 
around the world in over 1 7  time zones. Among the steps taken by Boeing

A CAD workstation used in designing the Boeing 777 
to keep this data network efficient, accurate, and secure was the laying of 
dedicated data lines across the Pacific Ocean from Washington to Japan. 
There, the Japanese Aerospace Industry, a consortium of Fuji, Kawasaki, 
and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, was responsible for about 20 percent of 
the fuselage structure. Involving the Japanese was a way not only to share 
the investment cost but also to promote airplane purchases by Pacific Rim 
airlines. 
The software of the computer-based 777 project enabled even the most 
subtle of interferences between parts or systems to be identified via an 
electronic preassembly program known as CLASH. The interferences 
were highlighted by flashing red zones and the identity of the parts and 
the names of the engineers responsible for them were available on the 
screen for immediate contact and attention. To be sure that the newly 
developed CAD system was itself reliable, early on in the design process 
some conventional physical mockups of aircraft subsystems were con­
structed. The computer system proved to be so effective at pinpointing 
interferences (see Fig. 7. 5) that further physical mockups were not used.

As for the accuracy of fit, the CAD program, in conjunction with com­
puter-aided manufacturing (CAM), in which digital data were fed directly 
into computer-controlled fabrication machinery, produced a 20.3 3-foot 
diameter fuselage whose components aligned within 0.023 inch vertically 
and 0.0 1 1 inch horizontally along the length of the airplane body-better 
than one in ten thousand. There was certainly little need for shims in 
such an assembly. 
Before the advent of CAD and CAM and the ease of communication 
they have allowed between design and manufacturing engineers, in most 
technological enterprises the drawings for individual parts were said to be 
"thrown over the wall" separating the design from the manufacturing 
teams, with the sometimes overly optimistic expectation hope that the part 
A I R P L A N E S  A N D  C O M P U T E R S 
1 3 1  

could in fact be made and mated with other parts. There had been a few 
notable exceptions to this short-sighted practice, and one was the division 
of Lockheed known as the Skunk Works, where design engineers worked 
in the same building in which their highly classified designs were assem­
bled. The Skunk Works was responsible for such supersecret and techni­
cally supersuccessful projects as the U-2 spy plane and the F-1 17 A stealth 
fighter. By having engineers and manufacturers share data and ideas as 
early as possible in the design process, and by having them work together 
in teams so that each knows what the other is thinking and can do, it is 
believed that misfits and related problems were cut in the 777 to such a 
great extent from what was traditionally expected that for competitive 
reasons Boeing has not said exactly how efficient the process actually was. 
In addition to producing parts that could physically be manufactured 
and actually mate with a minimum of shims, if any, the digital-computer­
based design-through-manufacturing system introduced in the Boeing 777 
eliminated another traditional glitch in the process. In the past, one of 
the big surprises that could arise even when parts fit perfectly was access 
to those parts, first by assembly workers and later, when the plane was in 
service, by maintenance workers. As a way of anticipating, at the design 
stage, situations where clearance was inadequate for a worker to reach a 
part of the plane, Boeing developed a simulated mechanic called CATIA­
man (Fig. 7.6), who could be manipulated to crawl around inside the 
assembled digital plane to be sure that there was enough elbow room to 
do what had to be done. 
FLY • B Y • W I R E  
The role of the computer was not limited to the design and production 
of the 777. This aircraft is Boeing's first airplane to have its flight control 
system operated electronically through twisted pairs of wires that connect 
the pilot's input to the aircraft's flight control output systems through the 
intermediary of on-board computers. All previous Boeing aircraft were 
controlled mechanically through a system of levers, cables, pulleys, and 
hydraulic lines that connected the pilot directly to the aircraft's control 
surfaces. Total "fly-by-wire" technology (as computerized flight control is 
called) was first employed in a commercial airliner by Airbus, when its 
A-320 was introduced in 1988. However, that airplane's fly-by-wire system 
came under scrutiny when some A-320s crashed in circumstances that 
called into question the reliability of the software that was at the heart of 
computer-controlled aircraft.

tion and maintenance operations 
Among the criticisms of the Airbus approach to fly-by-wire was that the 
on-board computer would not allow pilots to carry out certain maneuvers 
that were deemed too extreme for the aircraft. Thus, through its software 
programs, the computer limited the amount of acceleration the pilot 
could call upon so that the plane's structure would not be overloaded. 
Early versions of the software allowed the aircraft to fly very close to the 
ground at very low speed, but did not allow enough time for the engines 
to recover full power in the event that it was needed to abort a landing 
or react to some unforeseen condition. This limitation was removed after 
the crash of two A-320s. 
Another characteristic feature of the Airbus electronic control system 
was the relocation of the control stick from between the pilot's legs to a 
position beside the seat. But neither the new side-stick controllers nor the 
throttles moved when the computer automatically adjusted power to

A N D  C O M P U T E R S  
1 33 

maintain flight conditions, and this left the pilot without tactile or visual 
feedback about exactly what the plane was doing at any given time. 
Boeing's approach to fly-by-wire ill the 777 kept the pilot more in touch 
with the feel of the aircraft. For example, in addition to interpreting the 
pilot's commands and sending them to the engines and control surfaces, 
the computer was programmed to move stick controls and throttles to 
reflect the plane's condition. As airspeed changed, a force would build up 
in the control column to give the pilot a sense of how much acceleration 
the plane was undergoing. As for overstressing the airplane, Boeing's 
philosophy was that if an emergency situation arises, such as an impend­
ing midair crash, the pilot should be able t.o turn, dive, and accelerate as 
quickly as required to avoid the collision, even if the maneuver stresses 
the plane to the point where it suffers some structural damage. Such 
differences in philosophy are characteristic of all kinds of technology, and 
understanding their implications for reliability and safety will become 
increasingly important as more and more powerful and complex comput­
ers and computer programs are developed. 
In addition to the fly-by-wire features of the 777, Boeing introduced 
another innovation into the cockpit by replacing the cathode ray tube 
(CRT) displays with flat-panel full-color liquid crystal displays (LCD). As 
with technological change generally, there are pluses and minuses asso­
ciated with the different displays. The CRTs installed in 747s, for example, 
were found by pilots to be hard to read in strong sunlight, and the LCDs 
do not have a strong image in cold weather, which means that for such 
conditions there will have to be an auxiliary heating system installed. On 
balance, however, the change is claimed to be for the better. 
E N G I N E S  A N D  E C O N O M I C S 
Among the early selling points of the 777 was the fact that its two engines 
would be powerful and reliable enough to enable the plane to complete 
transoceanic flights even if one engine failed. Airlines were initially at­
tracted to two-engine planes because, generally speaking, they use less 
fuel per passenger and require less maintenance than three- and four-en­
gine models. But the mix of cost factors associated with operating an 
airline is not static, and by the time the aircraft was delivered other 
money-saving features had become selling points as well. Whereas the 
price of fuel was at one time the most important component of total cost, 
by the 1990s wages associated with maintenance and operation, as well

as debt service, were the dominant factors. The fuel efficiency of two-en­
gine aircraft was thus a bonus on top of the reduced cost of maintenance. 
Operating costs were less because the 777's fly-by-wire cockpit eliminated 
the need for a flight engineer, thus cutting the size of the flight crew by 
one-third. And the lower purchase price of a two-engine plane eliminated 
some of the financing costs for potential customers. 
Since the 777 was the biggest twin-engine jetliner ever put into opera­
tion, it had to have the most powerful engines ever made. The first 777s 
were fitted with Pratt & Whitney engines designated PW4000, which were 
capable of producing a thrust in the range of 80,000 pounds. This was 
over one-third more thrust than the most powerful engines on 74 7 jumbo­
jets. The 777 engines are described as high-bypass turbofans, which 
employ large, wide-bladed fans visible in the front of the engine to take 
in great amounts of air (Fig. 7.7). While some of the air is used to feed 
the turbine, which in turn rotates the fan, a considerable amount of the 
air bypasses the turbine and assists in propelling the plane. 
To make the 777 more attractive to a wide variety of airlines, whose 
maintenance crews and shops would not have experience or tools to deal 
with Pratt & Whitney engines without additional investment, alternative 
engines were offered. Among the options was a General Electric engine, 
which is so large that its nacelle-the streamlined outer covering that 
gives an engine its visible shape-is about the same diameter as the 
fuselage of a Boeing 757 airliner. Another engine option available on the 
777 was one made by Rolls Royce. Pratt & Whitney and General Electric 
engines are also options on Airbus planes. 
The fact that the 777 was designed to fly extended distances with one 
engine out made it a candidate for immediate transoceanic travel, if it 
could secure the necessary flight certification. In the past certification 
came only after extensive experience once the aircraft was put into com­
mercial service. In the mid-l 980s, however, after it was variously estimated 
that the chance of two engines independently breaking down simultane­
ously was one in a billion hours of flight or once every 50,000 years, the 
Federal Aviation Administration (FM) began to consider allowing twin­
engine jets to fly not only transatlantic routes but also transpacific routes. 
Such developments were critical to the success of Boeing's 767 and 777. 
Although Boeing considered the 777 to be an entirely new airplane 
model, the company emphasized that is was an evolutionary rather than 
a revolutionary development. The distinction was significant, for it meant

F I G U R E  7.7 
Pratt & Whitney engine mounted on a Boeing 777 
that the plane could be expected to receive expeditious flight certification. 
Among the additional arguments for such consideration was the fact that 
the 777 was to be subjected to unprecedented testing via computer before 
it was even assembled. Furthermore, its Pratt & Whitney engines were 
not totally new designs but were evolved from earlier models that had 
already demonstrated considerable reliability and were to undergo exten­
sive flight tests before the first airplane was delivered. Thus, years before 
the first 777 was handed over to United Airlines in 1995, Boeing antici­
pated that the FM would look favorably upon allowing it to skip the 
customary two-year test period during which the new plane had to remain 
I N V E N T I O N  BY 
D E S I G N  
1 36 

within 60 minutes' flying time of a major airport. This would, of course, 
have precluded transatlantic flights during the probationary period. The 
FM waived that requirement as expected, and the inaugural flight of the 
launch customer United Airlines was from London's Heathrow to Wash­
ington's Dulles Airport in June 1995. By the end of the year, the 777 had 
proven to be 97.5 percent reliable in meeting schedule demands, which 
compared with 94 percent for the 747-400 when it was introduced. United 
Airlines, however, was looking for even better performance and before the 
777 was a year old had written a letter of complaint to Boeing. The 
problems identified would send the engineers back to their electronic 
drawing boards. 
H U M A N  F A C T O R S  
The field of human factors, also known as ergonomics, endeavors to make 
the interface between a person and a piece of technology as logical, safe, 
comfortable, and friendly as possible. In the past, engineers have often 
been accused of not worrying about, or being incapable of appreciating 
the importance of, how their products were actually used by real (and 
fallible) people. This was reflected in jokes told about everything from 
incomprehensible user's manuals to electronic devices whose controls and 
settings were impossible to master. 
Consideration of human factors is critical in designing the cockpit of 
an airplane, of course, and for some time considerable attention to detail 
has been paid to this area of technology. This is why the dials, switches, 
levers, buttons, and other meters and controls have distinctly different 
looks and feels to emphasize their different meanings and functions. From 
mishaps in the nuclear power industry we know the dangers that can arise 
when designers ignore this consideration. Some erroneous operator ac­
tions in the control rooms of early nuclear power plants were attributable 
to the fact that more importance was paid to making the components on 
a control console match and look "modern" than to designing different 
controls, dials, and gauges with distinguishing features. Similarly, the 1992 
crash of an A-320 into a mountain near Strasbourg, France, as it was on 
a landing approach was attributed to the pilot's apparent confusion about 
the descent mode chosen (see Fig. 7.8). Crash investigators speculated 
that a 3.3-degree flight path was desired, but instead a 3300-feet/minute 
descent mode was punched into the computer. When the cockpit screen 
displayed 33, indicating the descent mode in hundreds of feet/minute, the 
pilot mistook it for 3.3, and thus did not realize that the plane was

Airbus descent modes possibly confused in computer-controlled landing 
descending at a faster rate than it should. A display designed with human 
factors considerations in mind could have shown the angle of descent as 
two digits (3.3) and the altitude change as four digits (3300), thus making 
a confusion of the two very unlikely. 
Perhaps because passengers, as opposed to pilots, were not seen to be 
directly interacting with a machine, designers of airliner cabins have 
traditionally paid more attention to aesthetics than to human factors. By 
realizing that, from the point of view of the airline, the passenger is the 
customer, and by deciding to include the airlines in the design process 
early on, Boeing was able to incorporate more passenger-friendly features 
into the cabin of the 777. 
For example, in addition to the higher ceilings and overhead bins that 
at the same time swing down to be more accessible, the cabin is fitted 
with overhead lights whose burned-out bulbs can be changed quickly and 
easily by a flight attendant. Rather than having only one movie to view 
and having to crane their necks or sit on pillows to peer over the seat in 
front of them in order to see a centrally located movie screen, 777 
passengers have individual entertainment monitors at their seats. Digital 
input received from a satellite communications network is transmitted to 
the individual monitors via fiber-optic cables throughout the aircraft. Each 
seat is also fitted with individual telephone sets whose keypads double as

The armrests of airplane seats were long manufactured with 
flip-top ashtrays, for the use of passengers who wished to 
light up in the air. In the early days of flight, a large 
proportion of the sophisticated flying public did smoke, but 
with first the decline of smoking, and then its outright ban 
on domestic flights, the ashtrays became an increasing an­
noyance for airlines. After every flight, the convenient little 
receptacles were stuffed with gum and peanut wrappers, 
and were time-consuming to empty. To put a stop to this 
practice, the airlines welded the ashtrays shut. 
Was this solution a failure of imagination on the part of 
the airlines? Can you think of any alternative measures the 
airlines could have taken to covert the ashtrays into some­
thing useful?

an input device to the screen, thus enabling interactive video games to 
be played and information banks to be accessed. The case history of the 
777, like that of virtually every large and complex technology project, 
shows that engineers do their job best when they interact with those who 
will be the customers of the product, whether they be the airlines or the 
passengers.

WA T E R  A N D  S O C I E T Y  
According to an early nineteenth-century definition, civil engineering 
is "the art of directing the great sources of power in nature for the use 
and convenience" of everyone. Later in that century a railroad engineer 
defined engineering generally as "the art of doing well for one dollar, what 
any bungler can do with two." These two ideas, social end and economy, 
are inextricably intertwined with virtually everything engineers do, al­
though sometimes the relative ratio of costs to social benefits is less than 
self-evident. Many of the products of modern manufacturing, such as 
paper clips and aluminum cans, are clearly conveniences, and civilization 
did exist without them and would no doubt continue to do so with little 
significant change if they were banned. More substantial products of 
engineering, such as bridges and jet aircraft, are in a different category, 
and the nature of transportation as we know it today would be drasti­
cally changed if cities like San Francisco had to rely entirely on ferries 
to cross the bay or if we had to return to travel by ship to cross oceans. 
For one thing, the amount of time such crossings would take would 
increase by an order of magnitude. With a less-developed transportation 
network, there would be fewer imported products, northern cities would 
not have citrus fruits so readily in winter, tea and coffee would be dearer, 
shoes and clothing would be manufactured more locally, and so forth. 
Nevertheless, society could still function, albeit at a slower, nineteenth­
century pace. 
The economic use and control of water is in yet another category from 
both cans and airplanes because it is an essential ingredient of life itself. 
Like warmth and shelter, people have always needed water, and a con­
siderable body of specialized engineering knowledge and techniques has 
developed over the centuries to provide, control, treat, and dispose of 
water for ever-growing communities of people. Individuals can survive in 
primitive conditions by living on insects and rainwater, as the Air Force 
141 

pilot downed in 1995 in Bosnia did for almost a week, and we can imagine 
that small bands of our nomadic ancestors were able to live on similarly 
scarce resources. But we prefer broader diets. The development of agri­
culture, which might be described as land and crop engineering, was 
intertwined with the ability to move water from where it was to where it 
was needed when the weather was not cooperative. In thל millennia since 
the establishment of agrarian societies, the control of water has been one 
of the great achievements of engineering. 
W A T E R  S U P P L Y A N D  R E M O V A L  
Roman cities are famous for their water supply, which made possible their 
public fountains and baths. Some of the grandest surviving Roman arch 
bridges, such as the Pont du Gard near Nice in southern France (Fig. 
8. 1 ), were built for transporting not people but water. They are the 
aqueducts designed to carry great quantities of water from the hills to the 
city. Vitruvius, in the oldest surviving book of engineering, described the 
lead and clay pipes used in the Roman water supply system, cautioning 
against the former as a health hazard. He also explained how reservoirs 
should be constructed at strategic locations and how pressures in the pipes 
could be kept under control. Loss of water due to leakage and unauthor­
ized removal from the Roman system was a chronic concern, and it has 
been estimated that half of the water entering the aqueduct system was 
lost before reaching its intended destination. There were thus plenty of 
problems presented for solution by Roman hydraulic engineers. Many of 
them were identified by Frontinus, the first-century Water Commissioner 
of Rome, who wrote in a famous report on the city's water supply that 
there was no comparison between the "idle Pyramids, or those other 
useless though renowned works of the Greeks" and the "indispensable 
structures" of the aqueducts. 
At the time Frontinus was writing, in 97 A.O., Rome was being supplied 
with 40 million gallons of water per day, according to one estimate, thus 
providing its one million inhabitants with a per capita supply very close 
to twentieth-century standards. The vast majority of Romans did not use 
such great amounts of water individually, of course, for they carried their 
daily supply in vessels from public fountains. Great amounts of water were 
diverted to the public baths and to laundries where togas were washed. 
But among the main reasons that a steady and dependable source of water 
was needed by Rome and other ancient cities was that it had to be 
available at all times to fight fires and to keep the city clean. Such

The Pont du Gard, a critical link in a Roman aqueduct 
overarching benefits to the whole community clearly justified the great 
effort and expense to design, build, and maintain a reliable water supply 
system in the first place. 
Even with the abundance of water delivered to Rome, only the wealthi­
est or most influential or devious of its citizens had water piped directly 
into their homes, but there was no organized sewer system to remove it 
after use, nor would there be a significant one in any city until the 
nineteenth century. The disposal of waste water, and waste generally, was 
left to each individual and household to solve on its own. Systems of large 
underground sewers for storm and waste water were well established by 
Frontinus's time, but the only direct connections to them were con­
structed at private expense. Most citizens used public latrines or emptied 
pots of kitchen and toilet waste directly into the city's gutters, which were 
flushed regularly into the sewers. When the rain did not do so, large 
quantities of water were also used to flush the sewers themselves, lest the

The expansion of the Paris sewer system during the Second 
Empire and Third Republic was a technological and politi­
cal triumph. During the Exposition of 1 867, the sewer 
administration began offering public tours of "un second 
Paris souterrain." The public descended into the sewers 
by means of an elegant iron stairway and rode in deluxe 
versions of the vehicles used in sewer cleaning (see Fig. 
8.2). Another part of the tour was made in carpeted and 
cushioned boats reminiscent of Venetian gondolas, each of 
which could hold sixteen people. 
Most sewer systems throughout the world are not open 
to the public, but it is important to have access in order to 
be able to inspect, clean, and repair them. A well-designed 
sewer system will have access holes (manholes) located 
throughout its length. Why are the covers on these man­
holes almost invariably round?

Sewermen walking wagons of visitors through the Paris sewers in the 1 870s 
odor and filth be unbearable. The importance of this function was spelled 
out explicitly by Frontinus: "I desire that nobody shall conduct away any 
excess water without having received my permission or that of my repre­
sentatives, for it is necessary that a part of the supply flowing from the 
water castles shall be utilized not only for cleaning our city but also for 
flushing the sewers." 
What to do with the contaminated water that was flushed from the 
sewers is a problem faced by cities to this day. Not until the mid-nine­
teenth century were civil engineers able to attack it in a systematic way. 
Engineers specializing in such problems became known as sanitary engi­
neers, a name that was current until about the 1970s, when it was 
superseded by the term environmental engineers to reflect the profession's 
interest in an ever-growing list of problems dealing with waste and the 
pollution of the environment. 
S AN I TARY 
SEWERS 
The solution of large-scale engineering problems that affect diverse con­
stituencies takes more than just technical know-how, for there has to be 
the societal resolve to impose the solution in an effective way and the 
WA T E R  A N D  S O C I E T Y

financial means for doing so. Such conditions were in place in London 
in the mid-nineteenth century. (In earlier centuries, the death rate had 
often exceeded the birth rate, thus keeping down the growth rate of cities 
and obviating any urgent need to develop radically new technologies.) 
Water supplies had included the sixteenth-century scheme of pumping 
water from the River Thames to the higher parts of the ).lletropolitan area, 
from which it could flow to its ultimate destinations by the force of grav­
ity. Some pumping was achieved by means of power derived from the 
tides through waterwheels placed in the narrow archways of old London 
Bridge. Also in use were neighborhood pumps that raised local ground­
water for community use. In time, it was' recognized that these potential 
sources of contaminated water from the river and the ground, into which 
dirty water flowed, resulted in intolerable health risks, even if the exact 
nature of those risks was not fully understood. 
Sanitary conditions in London in the early nineteenth century were 
abominable. There was a Commission of Sewers for the City of London 
proper, but its jurisdiction contained only about five percent of the 
300,000 houses and of the total population of 2,500,000 in the growing 
metropolitan area. Regional sewer systems existed, but they were poorly 
designed and often ineffective, with large ones discharging into smaller 
ones, which naturally could not accommodate the full flow. After a 
comprehensive study of London sanitary conditions, one engineer re­
ported in 1847 that there were houses without any drainage and with 
overflowing cesspools, and there were hundreds of streets without any 
sewers at all. At the time, an outbreak of cholera in India was working its 
way westward, and a royal commission advised that a single sewer district 
should be created to deal with the mess. Parliament, which met on the 
banks of the putrid Thames-then effectively an open sewer-agreed and 
passed legislation creating a Metropolitan Commission of Sewers, but 
little was done before more than 25,000 deaths due to cholera were 
recorded over the next six years. 
In the meantime, Joseph W. Bazalgette was appointed chief engineer 
of the Metropolitan Commission of Sewers, and he described the situation 
as he found it: 
According to the system which it was sought to improve, the London main 
sewers fell into the valley of the Thames, and most of them, passing under 
the low grounds on the margin of the river before they reached it, dis­
charged their contents into that river at or about the level, and at the time 
I N V E N T I O N  BY

only, of low water. As the tide rose, it closed the outlets and ponded back 
the sewage flowing from the high grounds; this accumulated in the low­
lying portions of the sewers, where it remained stagnant in many cases for 
1 8  out of every 24 hours. During that period, the heavier ingredients were 
deposited, and from day to day accumulated in the sewers; besides which, 
in times of heavy and long-<:ontinued rains, and more particularly when 
these occurred at the time of high water in the river, the closed sewers 
were unable to store the increased volume of sewage, which then rose 
through the house drains and flooded the basements of the houses. The 
effect upon the Thames of thus discharging the sewage into it at the time 
of low water, was most injurious, because not only was it carried by the 
rising tide up the river, to be brought back to London by the following 
ebb tide, there to mix with each day's fresh supply-the progress of many 
days' accumulation toward the sea being almost imperceptible-but the 
volume of the pure water in the river, being at that time at its minimum, 
rendered it quite incapable of diluting and disinfecting such vast masses 
of sewage. 
Understanding and articulating the problems with the existing sys­
tem -as Balzalgette clearly did in this passage, which may be described 
as a comprehensive failure analysis-is essential to working out an en­
gineering solution to a problem. He designed a sewer system to obviate 
the failures of the existing system. The capacity of the system was es­
tablished as being equal to the water supplied, and he designed the 
sewers to be large enough to carry that amount and to be laid at a 
sufficient slope to ensure that, even half full, the flow would be fast 
enough to prevent silting. Instead of emptying into the Thames in the 
middle of London, Bazalgette designed large intercepting sewers to run 
parallel to the banks of the river and to carry the waste water well 
downriver of the metropolitan area before discharging it. The sewer 
system was designed as an integral part of the Thames Embankment (Fig. 
8.3), which serves to this day as a popular fresh-air promenade along the 
river. 
For his pioneering engineering work that changed the London river­
front from an open sewer to a tourist attraction, Bazalgette was knighted 
in 1874 and is commemorated today on the central London area of the 
embankment known as the Victoria Embankment by a bronze plaque set 
in a monument at the foot of Northumberland Avenue, near Hungerford 
Bridge-within sight of monuments to the civil engineer lsambard King­
dom Brunel and the electrical engineer Michael Faraday.

Since each city's geographical and topographical situation is unique, each 
presents unique engineering problems of water supply and disposal, and 
the solutions often have to be modified as a city grows. Mid-nineteenth 
century Chicago took its water from Lake Michigan and returned it there 
and to the Chicago River, which emptied into the lake. In order to gain 
a fresh supply of water in the 1860s, a five-foot-diameter tunnel was run 
for two miles under the bed of the lake, far enough for any sewage to have 
been sufficiently diluted. The water was pumped to the 1 54-foot castle­
like tower that still stands near Water Tower Place, which was named for 
the historic location. From the Water Tower, distribution proceeded by 
gravity flow. 
With the growth of the city, however, increased sewage polluted the 
lake for miles offshore, and a new system of dealing with contaminated 
water was sought. In the last decade of the nineteenth century, Chicago 
began dredging operations to reverse the flow of the Chicago River, so 
that it drained not into Lake Michigan but into the Des Plaines River, 
which in turn flowed into the Illinois River and, eventually, into the 
Mississippi. While Chicago had thus protected its lake water supply from 
its own sewage, there was some question as to whether the diluting and 
oxidizing action of the rivers would cleanse the water sufficiently before 
it reached those communities downstream that relied upon it. The state 
of Missouri sued Illinois because it was dumping sewage into the water

supply of St. Louis, about 300 miles downstream, but the case was dis­
missed when evidence was presented to show that there was no health 
menace. Conditions were intolerable in the upper Des Plaines River and 
in the parallel Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal and the Illinois and 
Michigan Canal, however, and the City of Chicago had to install sew­
age-treatment plants through which the waste water had first to pass. 
Such debates among communities reflected in part the incomplete 
understanding of the nature of disease and the technical details of how 
to design a proper sewage system. Only with the maturation of sanitary 
engineering and parallel developments in water quality control, including 
a better understanding of the microbiology and chemistry of drinking 
water, was more general agreement about effective design criteria and safe 
levels of contamination established.

The layout of a water supply system, whether in ancient Rome or in 
Victorian England or late-nineteenth-century Chicago, has no unique 
solution, and in this regard it is a problem analogous to laying out any 
transportation network-roads, canals, or railroad tracks. The start and 
finish of the route are generally given by the location of the places 
between which the something (water, carriages, boats, or trains) is to be 
moved, and it is the job of the engineer to select economical, effective, 
and acceptable routes among the infinite possibilities between the ter­
mini. While scientific and mathematical principles can help translate the 
problem into analytical terms for conciseness of statement and ease of 
discussion, it is seldom only a simple matter of finding a solution to an 
equation, the way the quadratic formula gives the roots of a second order 
algebraic equation or calculus locates the minimum of a function. 
Consider the problem of getting water from a source of supply on one 
side of a mountain, such as the side where the rain falls heavily, to the 
reservoir serving a city on the leeward side, which receives relatively little 
rainfall (see Fig. 8.4). There are numerous ways that the water can be 
transported from the source, located at A, and the reservoir, located at M. 
These range from bucket brigades of people to combinations of pumps, 
pipes, siphons, aqueducts, and tunnels. 
For example, a pump might be used to raise the water to a certain level 
and a tunnel might carry it through the mountain. The tunnel should 
exit the mountain no lower than the maximum reservoir level desired, 
which is determined by the geometry of the reservoir and the volume of

problem and (bottom) cost curves for the problem 
water that it is designed to hold. The cross-sectional shape and size of the 
tunnel are related to the desired flow rate, and can be analyzed with the 
tools of the engineering science of hydraulics. If any kind of solids will 
be suspended in the water passing through the tunnel, its slope should 
be sufficiently steep to maintain a velocity that will prevent precipita­
tion of the solids and the disposition of silt, which might in time clog 
the tunnel. The total length of the tunnel will depend not only on its 
slope but also on exactly where it cuts through the mountain, which will 
I N V E N T I O N  BY 
D E S I G N

have different kinds of rock at different locations. The different geologi­
cal conditions will affect how, and how fast, the tunneling process can 
proceed, which in turn will affect the cost. All such considerations are 
summarized in Fig. 8.4 by the curve AB, which is nonlinear because 
of the complex way in which the various factors contribute to the total 
cost. 
The slope of the tunnel affects where its entrance is located, with 
steeper slopes requiring that the source water be pumped to higher 
elevations before gravity will carry it through the tunnel. Larger capacity 
pumps naturally cost more to purchase, install, and operate. The total 
cost of pumping for this example is shown as curve CD in Fig. 8.4. By 
adding the ordinates of the curves representing the cost of tunneling and 
the cost of pumping, the combined-cost curve EC can be constructed. 
The optimal pump/tunnel combination, as determined by the criterion 
of minimal cost, is shown by point F on the combined-cost curve. A 
perpendicular dropped to the axis of abscissas gives the slope of the 
optimum solution to the problem. 
An alternative way of establishing the minimum cost is to locate the 
points T and T' on the curves of pumping and tunnel cost, respectively, 
whose slopes are inversely proportional to each other. Before the advent 
of digital computers, this kind of calculation was done by trial and error, 
estimating the slope of the tangent on the graph itself, but now the whole 
process can be programmed into a digital computer for automatic itera­
tion to any desired degree of accuracy.

Getting a supply to a reservoir is only one part of the problem of 
designing a reliable water distribution system. In a real system, one or 
more reservoirs is interconnected by means of a network of pipes of various 
diameters and lengths delivering the water to homes, businesses, and other 
destinations. Before such a system exists, an engineer must establish or 
estimate the required difference in elevation (known as the "head") be­
tween different parts of the network, the location of the pipes and the 
connections among the pipes, their diameters and lengths, the number 
and kinds of valves and pumps that might be needed or desired, and the 
resistance to flow (due to the roughness of the pipes and the presence of 
various bends and other fixtures) encountered between reservoirs and 
outlets. 
In laying out a new piping network, an inexperienced engineer might 
WA T E R  A N D  S O C I E T Y  
1 5 1  

follow closely an example of an existing installation that seems to satisfy 
similar requirements. If there are no appropriate examples, perhaps be­
cause of the uniqueness of the new problem, then a combination of 
existing networks might be studied and the best features of each adopted 
to the new design. An engineer who has designed networks previously 
will have gained sufficient experience to be able to estimate rather well 
the required size of pipes and other components in the network in order 
to deliver water at its destinations with the appropriate pressure. Whether 
the engineer is young or experienced, problems with existing networks 
will need to be especially noted and taken, into account in designing the 
new system. For example, an inadequate volume of flow might indicate 
the need for larger diameter pipes, and difficulties encountered in clean­
ing an existing system might call for installing more manholes in the next 
system. 
The evolutionary designs of piping networks could proceed by trial and 
error over time, but a more analytical strategy is one of the main things 
that distinguishes modern engineering. An existing or proposed piping 
network can be approached in much the same way that a physical scientist 
might approach a system found in nature, namely, by constructing a 
mathematical model of it based on general principles. In a given piping 
loop in an ideal network, for example, we know that the mass of water 
combined or divided at a junction where the ends of several pipes come 
together (known as a "node") is conserved, that is, the net inflow is equal 
to the net outflow. A continuity equation can thus be written for that node, 
and if a piping loop has a certain number of nodes, then that same number 
of continuity equations can be written for the loop. 
Additional equations can be written to express the fact that energy is 
balanced around a piping loop, taking into account the potential energy 
associated with the heads of reservoirs, losses through pipes due to friction 
and change in elevation, and the addition of energy, as through a pump 
in the loop. Friction losses can be expressed analytically as functions of 
the pipe characteristics of length, diameter, and roughness, as well as of 
the rate of flow through the pipe. Such losses are nonlinear functions of 
the flow rate, so that, for example, doubling the flow rate more than 
doubles the energy loss in the pipe. These kinds of considerations lead to 
a system of algebraic equations equal in number to the number of pipes 
in the loop. Collectively, these equations are said to be a (mathematical) 
model for the piping loop, and a solution to the equations constitutes a 
prediction of how water will flow in a real system.

Since the equations modeling a piping loop are nonlinear, they cannot 
be solved directly or exactly, but various methods have been devised to 
approximate their solution as accurately as needed for engineering deci­
sions to be made. For any solution to be properly interpreted, however, it 
is as important for the engineer to understand the assumptions behind, 
and the limitations of, the models constructed as it is to understand when 
and how a particular mathematical model can be solved. 
Before the advent of digital computers, considerable thought and effort 
went into developing techniques for the approximate solution of equations 
such as those representing water flow around a piping loop. Employing 
these techniques was often a long and tedious process, requiring much 
repetitive calculation by hand. When extremely large and complex mod­
els were employed and large systems of equations had to be solved as 
accurately and efficiently as possible, the calculations were often done by 
teams of individuals, each of whom did only a specialized part of the 
calculation and passed the result on to others on the team who needed 
that number before proceeding with their own specialized part of the 
calculation. The individuals in such teams were known as computers, and 
they gave their name to the electronic machines that have revolutionized 
the way such calculations are done. 
At the heart of the electronic digital computer are still the same 
fundamental methods of mathematical modeling and approximation that 
were employed by engineers and teams of human computers that laid out 
piping systems, electrical transmission networks, railroads, and other parts 
of our infrastructure that still serve us today. While the computer has 
enabled more ambitious models to be constructed and solved in a fraction 
of the time it would have taken in precomputer days, engineers still must 
understand the principles behind the construction and solution of those 
models so that their assumptions and limitations are clear. Otherwise, 
engineers would be unthinkingly operating computers that were for all 
practical purposes black boxes into which an input was inserted and from 
which an output was taken. It is to such a situation that the familiar adage 
"Garbage in, garbage out" is often applied. Without an understanding of 
the principles of the system being modeled or the nature of the workings 
within the black box, engineers would be unable to exercise sound judg­
ment about the worth or reliability of the input or the output. 
One example of how poorly a system designed by computer can 
perform was provided by the automated baggage-handling system at the 
Denver International Airport, a case in which not a continuous flow of 
WA T E R  A N D  S O C I E T Y  
1 5 3  

water but an irregular flow of discrete pieces of luggage had to be distrib­
uted around a network. The airport's opening was delayed for over a year 
because, in testing the system, bags were being crushed, and the automatic 
cars they were to be delivered to and from were not connecting properly. 
The computer model of the system failed to take into account such things 
as the aerodynamics of the carts and the airflow patterns that flipped 
lighter luggage up and onto the floor. Among other early problems, there 
was also an improper matching of car availability and amount of baggage 
to be moved, a situation analogous to too-small sewers. Though much of 
the embarrassing performance was later blamed on electro-mechanical 
hardware problems rather than on the softWare that operated the system, 
the fundamental difficulties stemmed from a failure to appreciate that the 
computer model did not reflect the real system accurately enough. In 
addition, the system designed for Denver was over ten times as large as 
any previously built. Such a large scaling up in a single step is something 
experienced engineers know can be full of surprises, and it is seldom done 
on critical projects. 
Another example is provided by the twin towers of New York City's 
World Trade Center, which at 1 10 stories .high were the tallest buildings 
in the world when they were completed in 1973. Among the nonstructural 
problems faced in designing them was getting an adequate water supply 
to the top floors. Though the observation deck atop one of the towers 
provided a new and spectacular bird's-eye view of Manhattan and its 
environs, including New York Harbor, the Statue of Liberty, and the 
historic bridges over the East River, some early visitors to the restrooms 
on the top floor found them to be unsanitary eyesores when the water 
pressure was inadequate to flush all the waste into the sewer system.

Well into the late nineteenth century, there were two major theories of 
the causes of diseases like cholera and typhoid fever. One theory, sup­
ported by those known as contagionists, held that disease was spread by 
contact. The other, supported by anticontagionists, held that diseases 
came from bad air, such as that emanating from soil in which things were 
decomposing. A lack of clear understanding of causes led to practices that 
were more harmful than helpful to those struck down with disease. 
During the early years of the construction of the Panama Canal, begun 
by the French in 1880, a large number of workers became ill with malaria 
and died. The disease was believed to be caused by poisonous marsh gas,

as the word itself suggests. ("Malaria" derives from the Italian, mala aria, 
which means "bad air"; the French word for the disease is paludisme, 
which means "marsh fever.") The widely held, centuries-old miasma 
theory explaining the cause of the disease was supported by the evidence 
that malaria occurred mainly in hot, humid climates like the Isthmus of 
Panama, where the abundant growth and decay of vegetable matter gave 
off gases. Yellow fever, another common disease in the tropics, was be­
lieved to be caused by winds blowing across sewage, decaying animal 
matter, or infected patients. 
Suspicions that mosquitoes rather than the air transmitted malaria and 
yellow fever were put forth as early as the 1850s, but not until the 1880s 
was a full-blown theory advanced. In the meantime, French hospitals for 
treating malaria patients during the construction of the Panama Canal 
were kept fresh with the abundant scent of flowers, whose pots were 
surrounded by pools of water to keep ants and crawling insects from 
getting to the flowers and eating them. The legs of hospital beds were also 
placed in pans of water to keep crawling insects from reaching patients. 
These practices provided the stagnant water that was the perfect breeding 
ground for the very mosquitoes that caused the disease. The Americans 
took over the canal project after the French had abandoned it (in part 
because of their inability to control the tropical diseases), and standing 
water of all kind was sprayed with a film of oil to kill mosquito larvae and 
keep down the mosquito population. By the end of the project, deaths 
due to the disease were reduced almost to zero. 
Among the factors near the end of the nineteenth century that accel­
erated understanding of the true causes of infectious diseases was the 
discovery of the existence of microscopic bacteria and the development 
of the means for isolating and characterizing them by Louis Pasteur in 
France and by Robert Koch in Germany. Even before the existence of 
bacteria was firmly established, contaminated drinking water was known 
to be a cause of disease. In a famous bit of public-health detective work, 
Dr. John Snow, who was a pioneer in anesthesia, tracked down the source 
of a cholera outbreak in 1 854 by noting that those affected lived in the 
vicinity of a single source of water in London, while those who worked 
in a nearby brewery and who got their water from the brewery's own supply 
remained unaffected. Although both groups were breathing essentially the 
same air, those who were using the Broad Street Pump were drinking 
water polluted through the surrounding soil. When the pump handle was 
removed at Dr. Snow's suggestion, the epidemic subsided.

Effects of filtration and chlorination of water supply on the incidence of 
typhoid fever in Philadelphia 
With increased understanding of the causes of disease and the ill effects 
of the presence of microorganisms in drinking water supplies, sanitary 
engineers could design treatment processes and facilities that removed 
microorganisms from the water before it was introduced into the main 
piping network of a distribution system. The dramatic effects of filtration 
and chlorination on the incidence of typhoid fever in Philadelphia is 
shown in Fig. 8.5. Sanitary and, later, environmental engineers became 
increasingly interested in longer-term risk factors beyond those presented 
by microorganisms. These included risk factors associated with trace 
metals, especially lead, which might be introduced by pipe erosion and 
corrosion, or chromium and mercury, which might be introduced into 
water supplies from manufacturing or mining operations. 
Continuing studies related to the pollution of water, air, and other 
components of the environment brought increased attention to public 
health and ecological issues. The effect on public policy was made official 
by the passage in 1970 of the U.S. National Environmental Policy Act, 
and the establishment soon after of the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA). This combined into one independent government body an organi-
I N V E N T I O N  B Y  D E S I G N  
1 56 

zation that took over responsibilities formerly distributed among various 
separate agencies. With the establishment of the EPA, it was easier in 
theory to coordinate programs that oversaw the control and regulation of 
matters of environmental pollution in such diverse but often interrelated 
areas as pesticides, solid waste, air, and water. The subsequent passage of 
such legislation as the Clean Water Act (first passed in 1972 and revised 
in 1977), the Safe Drinking Water Act (1974), and the Resource Conser­
vation and Recovery Act ( 1976) expanded the federal role in pollution 
control and in research and development in support of that goal. Such 
concentrated power and centralized control over matters that are still 
not fully understood naturally have their advantages and disadvantages, 
their proponents and opponents. Subsequent shifts in political priori­
ties and public policy debates have caused the role of the EPA to change 
over time. 
Just as continuing research has produced evolving theories and ongoing 
debates within the medical scientific community about the carcinogenic 
effects of such things as asbestos, so there remained in the late twentieth 
century some open questions about the exact nature of such global 
environmental phenomena as the ozone layer and acid rain and how to 
deal with them, let alone questions about the safe levels of pollutants in 
water supplies. Engineers must be aware at all times of the status of such 
issues and standards and their proper interpretation. 
O T H E R  P R O B L E M S  
Among the legacies of the Industrial Revolution have been numerous 
new agents and substances that have threatened water supplies and the 
environment generally. While pollution was not unknown in past centu­
ries, as the water problems of ancient Rome and Victorian London 
demonstrate, with the late twentieth century came an increasing aware­
ness among engineers, scientists, and citizens generally that pollution 
problems on a global scale were growing with the world's population. 
Increasing awareness that human actions could have potentially devastat­
ing environmental effects was crystallized by the publication in 1962 of 
Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, which called attention to the toll that the 
increasing use of chemical pesticides was taking on animal life, particu­
larly birds, and to the potential threat posed to human health as well. 
Silent Spring brought a heightened awareness of the delicate ecological 
balance in the world and provided an impetus to the environmental 
movement generally.

Other environmental degradation, though perhaps less immediately 
noticeable, was also taking place qnderground, in the groundwater sup­
plies that so many people did or would rely upon. Long abandoned and 
forgotten, old buried storage tanks containing gasoline, oil, and toxic 
wastes were beginning to corrode and release their contents into the 
ground, where the chemicals diffused through the soil_ and found their 
way into groundwater streams. Practices once carried out without a second 
thought, such as using strong chemical solvents to clean airplanes as they 
stood on the runways of vast military airbases, also had led to enormous 
amounts of pollutants seeping into ground that had been pristine, if not 
sacred, in earlier times. 
' 
Such past practices, not necessarily done with any malice at the time, 
have produced new and challenging problems for environmental engi­
neers and hydrologists. Considerable scientific, technical, and computa­
tional obstacles must be overcome in developing models of how pollutants 
move through and threaten groundwater in a vast variety of geological 
conditions, ranging from strata of sand and clay to masses of fractured and 
faulted rock. The development of such models must necessarily take place 
in a context where only limited data are GtVailable about the history of a 
site, the concentrations of pollutants, and the geological map of the media 
in which the groundwater is flowing. It thus takes clever and sophisticated 
analytical approaches to predict flow behavior accurately enough to fore­
warn water users of unacceptably dangerous conditions or to propose 
possible strategies to preclude such conditions. 
The design and implementation of effective remediation strategies that 
can check or reverse the effects of groundwater pollution are as much 
engineering problems as are the design and development of a new reser­
voir or water tower. The end product in a groundwater remediation 
program is likely to be a system of underground dams or barriers to check 
further infiltration of pollutants or a system of strategically located wells 
interconnected with pumping and treating equipment that is designed to 
remove the pollutants. Perhaps to offset the less tangible end of the design, 
computer models that lead to such systems are often accompanied by 
elaborate colorful graphics depicting the motion and concentration of 
underground plumes of pollutants over long periods of time. 
Providing an adequate water supply, disposing of waste water, and 
dealing with the pollutants in both of these hydraulic systems are among 
the most challenging problems facing engineers of the twenty-first cen­
tury. Their analysis and resolution necessarily involve a wide range of

knowledge: of the chemical, physical, biological, and geological sciences; 
of the engineering sciences of fluid mechanics and hydrology; and of 
mathematics and computer science. In addition, sound engineering judg­
ment must be applied to the design and development of proposals that 
are reasonable, effective, economical, and of optimal benefit to society, as 
all engineering approaches should be.

Large engineering projects usually have a· long history, which in some 
cases stretches decades beyond any single engineer's career. There can be 
innumerable competing proposals and false starts, as well as long periods 
of inactivity and distraction caused by the need to work on other projects 
or by economic or political conditions seemingly beyond anyone's control. 
Elements of luck and timing enter in as well, as they do in any human 
endeavor. The story of the origins, design, financing, and construction of 
just about any major bridge can serve as a model for demonstrating this 
long and tortuous history and the many interrelated complexities that go 
along with all large engineering projects. 
From ancient times to the Industrial Revolution, there prevailed a long 
and solid tradition of building bridges of stone and timber. Timber bridges 
were not only common in their own right, but a timber bridge of sorts 
(known as centering or falsework) had to be erected as a supporting form 
before a stone bridge could be put in place (see Fig. 9. 1). Thus, in the 
late eighteenth century, when a new bridge was needed in the Severn 
Valley in England, there was a natural caution against the idea of using 
iron, despite the fact that the Darby family had made the valley well 
known for its iron production. The Darbys used the locally abundant coal 
residue known as coke in place of scarce timber in the smelting process, 
and the lack of timber made iron for bridge construction even more 
sensible. Yet the sketches that survive of early proposals for an iron bridge 
across the Severn River emphasize the strong bias toward traditional 
materials that had to be overcome. 
One of the sketches shows the iron cast into stonelike voussoirs, and 
the other shows iron mimicking timber. The bridge as built (Fig. 9.2) 
has the familiar overall appearance of a semicircular Roman stone arch 
bridge, while the assembly details are reminiscent of contemporary timber 
bridge construction. Such extra-technological deference to traditional

Falsework in place under a stone arch bridge 
materials and methods of construction overcame the resistance to tech­
nological change promoted by such vested interests as stonemasons, car­
penters, and ferry boat operators. In the final analysis, however, clear and 
effective communication, ameliorating the sense of threat and uncer­
tainty that the new material prompted, was a crucial factor in ɠetting Iron 
Bridge built. 
Once the bridge was successfully erected, its real advantages could 
speak for themselves. Because the cast-iron sections were so large and 
self-supporting, the bridge was put up in such a short time that there was 
a minimum disruption of river traffic. The promise of iron as an effective 
bridge material was further emphasized when Iron Bridge was the only 
bridge across the Severn to survive the flood of 1795. Stone bridges, 
because of their relatively small opening relative to their massive abut­
ments and silhouettes, tended to clog up and act like dams under flood 
conditions. Timber bridges, although more open, tended to wash away 
because of their lack of strength against the force of water and trapped 
debris. Iron Bridge, on the other hand, being both open and strong, 
allowed the raging flood waters to pass through its lacy structure, which 
was seen eventually to possess an aesthetic of its own. 
With the triumph of Iron Bridge, bridge designers increasingly began 
to think of iron as an innovative new material with which to work. But, 
whereas the design of Iron Bridge, based on the long-tested arch princi­
ple, required little sophisticated analysis of the forces acting on it, the 
bolder designs for iron bridges that were proposed in the early nineteenth 
century had little precedent upon which to argue for their safety. Suspen­
sion bridges, for example, used wrought iron in tension instead of cast

Iron Bridge, completed in 1779, across the Severn River 
iron in compression, and the structural action involved had no counter­
part in stone or timber construction. Engineers proposing suspension 
bridges had to rely in public on their drawing, writing, and speaking 
talents as much as they did in private on their analytical and political 
abilities. Whereas they may have addressed to their satisfaction any strictly 
technical questions at the drawingboard or through experiments, the 
questions of strength, safety, economics, aesthetics, and the like that were 
raised by citizens, investors, politicians, and other lay persons required a 
talent for persuasive speaking and writing. 
Proposals for a variety of different bridge types, and reports of progress 
on their construction, were models of nineteenth-century engineering. 
They were made possible by steady progress throughout the century in 
understanding beam action and in analyzing structures, and this new 
understanding was often conveyed to the lay public. However, in the 
1840s in Britain, suspension bridges were not considered viable options 
for railroad structures, despite the great demand for crossings as rail routes 
were expanded. This poor stature of suspension bridges was attributable 
in part to the bridges' lack of stiffness and susceptibility to collapse in high

As a young engineer, Othmar Ammann worked for Gustav 
Lindenthal, whose design for a massive suspension bridge 
between New York and New Jersey across the Hudson River 
was so ambitious and expensive that in over thirty years 
it had not gotten sufficient backing to progress very far. 
After trying unsuccessfully to get Lindenthal to redesign his 
bridge to less monumental proportions, in the early 1 920s 
Ammann began to work independently on a more modest 
proposal for a Hudson River bridge. 
Without informing Lindenthal, Ammann communi­
cated his ideas to the future governor of New Jersey, who 
then promoted it as part of his administration. When Lin­
denthal found this out through newspaper accounts, he 
accused the younger engineer of unethical behavior. Did 
Othmar Ammann act in an unethical way?

winds, which were known to engineers and laypersons alike. As a result, 
many alternative bridge designs were developed in Britain, including the 
iron tubular span exemplified in 'the Britannia Bridge. The extreme 
weight and cost of the Britannia, however, led to the evolution of open 
truss girder designs, which were to be taken to extremes of lightness in 
the Tay Bridge, as we shall see. 
Railroad bridge building in America followed a different evolutionary 
route, in part because the persuasive qualities of John Roebling's person­
ality and writing complemented his engineering talents and acumen. 
Roebling's Niagara Gorge Suspension Bridge, completed in 1 854, pro­
vided an incontrovertible counterexample to the British hypothesis that a 
suspension bridge could not carry railroad traffic. He went on to conceive 
and propose the landmark Brooklyn Bridge, and the story of the many 
long years that Roehling spent trying to convince others of his plan, after 
he had first persuaded himself, is one of the great dramas in the history 
of engineering. It often serves as a paradigm for all engineering projects 
precisely because the vicissitudes of that great project are far from unique. 
But we might just as easily take as paradigmatic the story of Othmar 
Ammann and the George Washington Bridge, which was prefigured for 
almost a century by numerous plans for crossing the Hudson River at New 
York City. Ammann's pragmatic flexibility enabled him to achieve what 
his mentor, Gustav Lindenthal, could not, in large part because he could 
not adapt his railroad-age design for a behemoth of a bridge to the 
changing needs of a society that was developing a growing love for the 
automobile. In the early 1920s Ammann and Lindenthal parted ways, and 
the younger engineer was able to persuade political and business groups 
on both sides of the Hudson that his light and graceful $30 million bridge 
between Fort Lee in New Jersey and I 79th Street in Manhattan was the 
route to go, even though technically it represented effectively a doubling 
of the longest suspension bridge span then in existence. Both Lindenthal 
and Ammann have left a voluminous legacy of written documents arguing 
the case for bridges, both built and unbuilt.

Among the major bridges of the world whose story is not as well known 
as it should be is the crossing of the bay between San Francisco and 
Oakland, California. Officially called the San Francisco-Oakland Bay 
Bridge, this enormous structure of over eight miles in total length has 
been overshadowed almost from the beginning of its operation by its 
I N V E N T I O N  B Y  D E S I G N  
164 

neighbor, the Golden Gate Bridge, just a few miles to the northwest. Ideas 
for bridges at each of these locations go back to the nineteenth century, 
including a curious proposal issued in the form of a proclamation in 1869 
by a fellow who declared himself Norton the First, Emperor of the United 
States and Protector of Mexico. Joshua A. Norton is believed to have been 
a fortuneseeker who went to California during the Gold Rush of 1849, 
struck it rich, but then lost everything, including his mind. He disappeared 
for a while but then reappeared as the self-declared emperor whose seat 
of power was in Oakland, where local people humored him and honored 
the paper money he issued. The fact that he proclaimed that a bridge be 
built from Oakland to Sausalito via San Francisco suggests that the idea 
was current in his time. However, it was not until the early decades of 
the twentieth century, when major bridges were being constructed all 
across the country, that proposals for various bridges in the San Francisco 
Bay area began to receive more serious attention. 
Engineers who found themselves in California on other business be­
came familiar with the need for bridges across the bay and its outlet to 
the sea-the strait known as the Golden Gate. One of these engineers 
was Joseph Strauss, who was president of his own Chicago-based Strauss 
Bascule Bridge Company. A bascule bridge is one whose roadway rotates 
on a hinge so that the span can be lifted out of the way of ships that need 
to pass. In this way the bridge can be built with a low clearance across a 
river, and thereby not require a lot of land on either side for long and 
high approaches. Strauss had become successful by designing and build­
ing such movable bridges in built-up and crowded cities like Chicago, 
where land for bridge approaches was very expensive, if available at all. 
With his experience in patenting and building moveable bridges, Strauss 
was also able to design an amusement ride known as the Aeroscope, in 
which passengers were carried up in a car as large as a two-story house 
and revolved at the end of a 265-foot cranelike boom over the grounds of 
the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, which was held in San 
Francisco in 191 5 to commemorate the opening of the Panama Canal. 
In that same year, the Strauss Bascule Bridge Company was awarded 
a contract to replace an old swing bridge across a San Francisco creek 
with a new bascule bridge. The Fourth Street Bridge, as it is known, is 
generally considered an ugly and purely functional design, as were many 
such bridges, with a heavy concrete counterweight suspended overhead. 
In any event, business travels relating to the Aeroscope and the Fourth 
Street Bridge caused Strauss to cross paths with the San Francisco City

165 

Engineer, Michael O'Shaughnessy, who dreamed of having a bridge 
across the Golden Gate. 
Within a few years, Strauss had produced an uninspired design for a 
Golden Gate bridge. However, no matter how unattractive it was, Strauss's 
cost estimate of $17 million and his projection that toll revenues would 
in time more than cover that entire cost made the proposal very attractive 
to proponents of a bridge. Furthermore, Strauss's political savvy and 
entrepreneurial spirit, which drove him to talk up his proposal before any 
local civic or political group that would listen, eventually led to the dream 
becoming reality. The human story of Strauss and the Golden Gate Bridge 
is a long and acrimonious one, in which Strauss and O'Shaughnessy 
eventually became adversaries and in which Strauss dismissed and denied 
credit to his assistant engineer for design, Charles Ellis. However, in spite 
of the bridge's unglamorous beginnings and the difficult interpersonal 
relationships that ensued during its design and construction, the Golden 
Gate Bridge stands today as one of the most admired bridges in the world, 
at least in part because of its dramatic setting and the strikingly simple 
and beautiful design that eventually evolved. 
The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, on the other hand, has a less 
unified appearance and occupies a site that does not lend itself to dramatic 
sunsets or to views that encompass the entire bridge. In contrast to the 
Golden Gate Bridge, whose single dominant 4200-foot main span was at 
one time the world's longest, the Bay Bridge is really made up of two 
distinctly different kinds of spans, each of which constituted a major 
bridge project in its own right, plus a significant tunnel through an island 
that rises high out of the water in the middle of the bay, a couple of miles 
from either shore. Although the construction of the Bay Bridge across 
deep water that was heavily traveled by ships presented enormous techni­
cal challenges to its engineers, it is not as widely recognized for the 
achievement it is because of the social and aesthetic accidents of its 
construction and appearance, and because of its. being overshadowed by 
the contemporary project of the Golden Gate Bridge.

With most large bridge projects, a variety of proposals are put forth before 
a final design is settled upon. Just as Strauss's early and ungainly design 
for the Golden Gate Bridge was fortunately modified over the course of 
its design time to become an object of beauty as well as a technical 
achievement, so the Bay Bridge evolved slowly from early proposals to its 
I N V E N T I O N  B Y  D E S I G N  
1 66 

final form. Among the more serious early proposals was one put forth by 
the civil engineer Charles Evan Fowler. Fowler was a Seattle-based con­
sulting engineer who, like many of his contemporaries, dreamed of build­
ing the largest bridge in the world. Just as Strauss had become acquainted 
with the problem of bridging the Golden Gate while doing other business 
in San Francisco, so Fowler became interested in the problem of a bay 
bridge when he was engaged in designing the steelwork for one of the 
city's earliest steel-frame buildings. Like many a consulting engineer, 
Fowler was always looking for opportunities to secure new and prominent 
commissions. He prepared and printed at his own expense a booklet that 
laid out the problem of bridging the bay and presented his design for a 
solution. 
Fowler published his booklet, entitled The San Francisco-Oakland 
Cantilever Bridge, in 1914. At that time, tunnel schemes for crossing the 
bay had been estimated to cost at least $25 million, and it was necessary 
to explain why any bridge costing a considerable amount more was a 
better choice. In fact, because of technical surprises that seemed invari­
ably to accompany tunnel projects and because of the limited traffic 
capacity their necessarily small diameter tubes provided, comparative 
studies of tunnels and bridges were a matter of some heated debate not 
only in San Francisco but around the world. Thus, although Fowler's 
bridge proposal carried a price tag of $75 million, he argued that it was 
in the final analysis cost-effective and proceeded to describe it in the 
context of known bridge projects of the time. 
Among the big decisions that faced bridge engineers in the early part 
of the twentieth century was the basic structural form that they would 
employ for long spans. Such a span would be required to bridge the 
deep-water distance between the city of San Francisco and the large is­
land two miles out in the bay known variously as Yerba Buena Island or 
Goat Island or, more recently, as Treasure Island. This last name, strictly 
speaking, refers only to an artificial island formed adjacent to the large 
rock outcrop that comprises the natural island. Indeed, Treasure Island 
was created as the site of the 1939 West Coast World's Fair held to 
commemorate the engineering achievements of both the Golden Gate 
Bridge and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. 
Because the water was approximately 200 feet deep, the construction 
of foundations and piers to serve as bridge supports for a crossing would 
be costly and dangerous. It was thus desirable to have as few supports in 
the water as possible, and this meant that the superstructure should have

spans as long as possible. In 1914, when Fowler was writing, the suspen­
sion bridge with the longest span was the 1600-foot Williamsburg Bridge 
in New York City. Although as early as the late 1880s engineers like 
Lindenthal had proposed bridges with suspended spans of the order of 
3000 feet, such extra-long-span designs did carry very large cost estimates. 
Furthermore, they were so far beyond the experience of bridge building 
projects up to that time that the wisdom of making such large leaps in 
the state of the art was seriously questioned. 
C A N T I L E V E R  B R I DG E S  
Fowler wrote in his report that the problem of bridging the bay between 
San Francisco and Oakland had been "uppermost" in his mind for a 
quarter of a century. That would have put his first thoughts on the matter 
in the late 1880s, when cantilever bridges were attracting a lot of attention 
among engineers. A cantilever bridge is a self-suppmting structure that 
can be built out as large individual cantilever beams from piers or towers, 
thereby requiring no scaffolding underneath (see Fig. 9.3). This is an 
attractive design and construction technique because it eliminates the 
need to erect scaffolding that might obstruct shipping during bridge 
construction and that would certainly add to the bridge's cost. 
The idea of a self-balancing cantilever was novel in the late 1880s, 
however, and a very large one was being built in Scotland only because 
other types of bridges had fallen into disrepute after a famous bridge 
collapse. The need for long bridges on the east coast of Scotland had 
developed when the North British Railway wished to eliminate the ferry­
ing of railroad cars across the wide estuaries known as the Firth of Forth 
and the Firth of Tay. The bridge across the Tay was completed first, in 
1878. It was a long, sinuous structure with many piers in the relatively 
shallow water. The most striking feature of the bridge was the high girders 
that rose, in almost 250-foot spans, above the main shipping channel. One 
night late in 1879, these fell or were blown into the water during a violent 
storm. About 75 people were killed in the horrendous accident, and there 
was a major inquiry into why it had occurred. 
A Court of Inquiry found that the bridge's engineer, Sir Thomas Bouch 
(he had been knighted for the project), had been negligent in his design 
and in his supervision of construction. The force of the wind on the light 
bridge had been grossly underestimated by Bouch, and one theory of the 
failure was that the high girders and the train crossing them were simply 
toppled off their supports, to which the girders had not been sufficiently

The railroad bridge at Poughkeepsie, New York, under construction in the 
late 1 880s, illustrating the cantilever principle 
anchored. Another finding was that the iron columns on which the bridge 
stood were made of inferior castings, full of holes that weakened the 
structure. As with many early structural failures that left a mass of twisted 
metal, the exact cause remained somewhat debatable, but Bouch's repu­
tation was irreparably damaged. A replacement bridge was designed and 
built across the Tay, but the task was to be given to other engineers. 
At the time of the Tay Bridge failure, Bouch had also been overseeing 
the construction of a more ambitious bridge across the Firth of Forth, 
about 50 miles to the south. His design for that crossing had been a 
long-span suspension bridge, because the water was deep and he wanted 
to put as few piers in the water as possible, in order to work within 
allowable depths and to keep costs down. Not surprisingly, when the Tay 
Bridge fell, construction on Bouch's Forth bridge was halted. After he was 
found responsible by the Tay inquiry, Bouch's design was abandoned 
altogether. The task of designing a new bridge for the Firth of Forth was 
eventually given to the well-known and experienced British engineer Sir 
John Fowler. Since a major concern of the railroad company was to win 
back among passengers some degree of confidence in its bridges, a sus­
pension bridge design, which was not generally favored in Britain anyway, 
became even more undesirable because it had been favored by Bouch. 
Sir John and his young assistant engineer, Benjamin Baker, thus came 
up with a relatively new idea for a British bridge-a cantilever. 
The errors made in the design and construction of the Tay Bridge were 
described in considerable detail in the report of the Court of Inquiry, and 
the Tay accident led to the development of the massive cantilever bridge 
across the Firth of Forth. This bridge was the subject of many public 
lectures by Baker, and of numerous written reports reproduced around 
B R I D G E S  A N D  P O L I T I C S  
169 

F I G U R E  9.4 
Anthropomorphic model of the cantilever bridge over the Firth of Forth 
the world. Because the Forth Bridge was so ambitious a design, especially 
in the wake of the collapse of the Tay, which was on the same railway 
line, it was necessary for Baker to communicate to the public the princi­
ples of cantilever construction. 
Like most ideas, the cantilever bridge was not entirely new. Such 
bridges had been built in the Far East for some time, and some had of 
late been constructed in Germany and America (see Fig. 9.3). Thomas 
Bouch himself had even constructed a lesser-known one in Newcastle. 
However, the cantilever that Fowler and Baker proposed for the Firth of 
Forth was to be enormous, spanning about twice the distance of any then 
in existence. Because they were doing something so daring, Baker took 
great pains to explain the principle of the cantilever in the numerous 
public lectures he gave while the bridge was under construction. To 
illustrate the structural ideas behind the design, Baker employed a human 
model that consisted of two people on chairs and supporting a third person 
on a seat suspended between them (see Fig. 9.4). The arms of the people 
on the chairs and the struts that they held represented the cantilevers, 
I N V E N T I O N  B Y  D E S I G N  
170 

with the counterweights of bricks providing balance. The swing repre­
sented a suspended portion of the bridge, but it looked nothing like the 
kind of suspension bridge Bouch had proposed, nor did it behave in 
principle like it. The distance from chair to chair thus came to be referred 
to, incorrectly, as the span of the cantilever itself. 
The Firth of Forth Bridge was immensely successful. It became famous 
throughout the world and had many imitators, and by the end of the 
nineteenth century a cantilever was the bridge of choice for many design­
ers, builders, and purchasers of bridges. When it became desirable to 
bridge the St. Lawrence River at Quebec, a cantilever with spans even 
longer than the record 1710 feet of the Firth of Forth was designed. Con­
struction of the south arm of the Quebec Bridge had reached a distance 
of about 600 feet over the river in August 1907 when the bridge suddenly 
collapsed, killing about 80 workmen. Though the Quebec bridge was 
found to be grossly underdesigned, the failure called cantilevers of all 
kinds into question. The Quebec Bridge was eventually redesigned as a 
stronger structure and was finally completed in 1917. At the end of the 
twentieth century its span of 1800 feet remains the record for a cantilever 
bridge. 
Such troubles with cantilever bridges were not thought to be likely 
when Charles Evan Fowler first began to think about bridging San Fran­
cisco Bay, for the Firth of Forth Bridge was thought to be a model for 
design. Perhaps because of its association with Sir John Fowler, whose 
surname he shared, or perhaps because later on Charles Evan Fowler 
knew that the Quebec incident was a case of bad design that need not 
condemn the whole genre of cantilever bridges, for decades he clung to 
the design he had come up with in his youth for a bridge between San 
Francisco and Oakland. Fowler proposed a Forth-like cantilever bridge 
(Fig. 9.5) with three main spans of 2000 feet each (two 650-foot cantilever 
arms supporting a suspended span of 700 feet between them), thus pro­
posing a bridge longer than any in the world. Fowler dismissed still longer 
cantilevers of 2300-foot span and a suspension bridge alternative because 
of cost and "seismic conditions" in the bay area. 
His report included a diagram showing the relative proportions of his 
2000-foot cantilever span and a suitably proportioned outline of the 
1710-foot spans of the Firth of Forth Bridge, which itself had once been 
compared to more familiar structures, such as the Eiffel Tower (Fig. 9.6). 
Fowler also pointed out that the profile of his spans was chosen "not only

Charles Evan Fowler's design for a cantilever bridge between San Francisco 
and Goat Island 
for economical reasons, but to provide a structure of pleasing design." 
Such aesthetic considerations are often very high in the consciousness of 
engineers designing large, monumental structures. 
Although Fowler did not mention the Quebec Bridge in his report, he 
knew that his readers would recall its relevance. It was well known that 
the Quebec Bridge failed because its lower chord members, correspond­
ing to the struts held by the seated figures in Baker's model, were simply 
not strong enough to resist the great compressive forces being imposed 
upon them. The situation was analogous to those people holding not thick 
objects like baseball bats but slender ones like yardsticks. Pushing down 
too hard on such slender sticks, as we can readily verify by a chair-seat or 
desk-top experiment with a plastic yardstick or ruler, causes a phenome­
non known as buckling, in which the stick suddenly springs out from 
under the pressure. Since such a situation had effectively occurred at the 
Quebec Bridge construction site in 1907, Fowler wanted to assure his 
readers that the same thing could not happen in his design. He did this 
by comparing the area of the lower chords of several well-known contem­
porary bridges. The Queensboro cantilever bridge, with a maximum span 
of almost 1200 feet, had recently been completed in New York City with 
a lower chord area of 1 120 square inches. Also in New York at the time, 
a massive steel arch railroad bridge was under construction across a 
treacherous stretch of water known as Hell Gate, and its lower chords had 
an area of 1437 square inches. Fowler's bay bridge was to have chords of 
I N V E N T I O N  B Y  D E S I G N

Scotland's Firth of Forth Bridge compared, to scale, with the contemporary 
Eiffel Tower 
octagonal cross section with an area of at least 3600 square inches, and 
he assured his readers that areas as great as 6000 square inches could be 
fabricated. 
The great cantilevers proposed by Fowler were necessary to cross the 
bay between San Francisco's Telegraph Hill and Goat Island, the part of 
the waterway that required the widest and highest clearance for shipping. 
Fowler's plan for crossing the island was to excavate to the degree needed 
to provide a level path for four railroad tracks and two roadways. The 
considerable amount of excavated earth was to be used to fill in low areas 
and extend the island into some shallow water to the west, thus reducing 
somewhat the total length of bridge there. Over the East Bay between 
Goat Island and Oakland, Fowler proposed using earth fill to extend the 
land about two miles out into the bay. The remaining two miles of bridge 
needed to cross the water would consist of about a mile and a half of 
viaduct, which would essentially be a bridge of many modest spans on 
piers in relatively shallow water, plus another major cantilever bridge, but 
with a comparatively modest maximum span. 
Proposing a bridge of the kind Fowler did would be only an exercise 
in structural design if he could not show it to be practical and economi­
cally feasible. Matters of practicality included getting railroad trains, ve­
hicular traffic, and people on and off the bridge where it touched land. 
This was relatively easy on the Oakland side, where there could be a long 
bridge approach over filled land, thus providing a gradual grade. On the 
San Francisco side, however, it was another matter to bring traffic down 
from a bridge that had to be 165 feet above the water to allow ships to 
pass beneath it. Since the land that might be used for approaches in the 
city was developed and expensive to purchase and clear, it was desirable 
B R I D G E S  A N D  P O L I T I C S  
173 

to minimize the length of approaches. To reduce the approach distance 
of railroad tracks while maintaining a reasonable grade, Fowler proposed 
that the railroad terminals be elevated. He also proposed that large eleva­
tors be installed capable of raising and lowering great numbers of pedes­
trians at a time from a bridge terminal on Telegraph Hill. 
The economic justification for the elaborate bridgח scheme Fowler 
proposed lay in the great increase in ferry traffic across the bay that had 
developed over the decades. During 1873, according to Fowler, there were 
about 2.5 million ferry passengers. By 1877 the number had doubled to 
over 5 million. By 1912 the number had reached 40 million annually and 
was projected to increase at the rate of about 2 million per year for the 
next ten years, the time estimated to build a bridge. Thus, by the time 
the bridge could be completed, in the mid-l 920s, it would have to have 
a potential for carrying 60 million people annually. 
Of Fowler's estimate that $75 million would be needed to build a bridge 
and terminals and pay interest on the money borrowed for the construc­
tion, two-thirds of the total, or almost $50 million, would be required for 
the massive cantilevers alone. Still, in Fowler's judgment, the "probable 
earnings" at the time of the bridge's completion would make it a paying 
proposition. Not everyone agreed, however, and in his massive two-vol­
ume 1916 treatise, Bridge Engineering, the prestigious and influential 
engineer ]. A. L. Waddell doubted whether wagon and automobile traffic 
would pay for the upkeep of the roadway, let alone pay for the interest on 
the additional cost of construction for it. 
To establish his own credentials for such a bold proposal, Fowler had 
appended to his report a list of his published works and photographs 
of some bridges for which he had served as chief engineer of design or 
as a consulting engineer. These included a steel arched cantilever in 
Knoxville, Tennessee, the towers of the Williamsburg Bridge in New York 
City, and a triangular railway arch bridge at White Pass, Alaska. Though 
several aspects of his main bridge design were remarkably similar in type 
and location to many others that would be presented over the next decade 
or so, Fowler was not to be involved in the bridge that was eventually 
built. In part, his timing was unfortunate, in that a second accident during 
the final stages of construction of the Quebec Bridge occurred in 1916, 
when the suspended span fell into the water as it was being hoisted into 
place. This incident cast further doubts on Fowler's judgment in proposing 
a cantilever bridge whose main spans would be even longer than those

developments in international affairs turned people's minds and society's 
resources to other matters.

World War I caused virtually all large bridge projects to be put aside, but 
in the 1920s schemes for crossing San Francisco Bay were revived. Espe­
cially popular were plans capable of relieving the growing traffic problems 
created by automobiles and trucks while at the same time turning a profit 
for investors who would build and operate toll bridges. Of course, ferries 
still carried vehicles across the bay from San Francisco to Oakland and 
Berkeley to the east and to Marin County to the north, but this mode of 
transportation was slow and frustrating, and during rush hours or over 
weekends the lines of cars waiting for a ferry could seem to be inter­
minable. The ferry operators understandably opposed the building of 
bridges, but bridges were becoming increasing attractive alternatives. 
In cities like New York, where colder winters could cause the Hudson 
River to ice over, thus interrupting ferry service altogether, cries for bridges 
and tunnels were loud and clear. Thus, the first vehicular tunnel under 
the river was begun in the early 1920s, amid considerable controversy 
regarding the nature of its design and construction and questions as to 
whether poisonous exhaust fumes could be effectively vented. The tunnel 
came to be named after its chief engineer, Clifford Holland, who died 
shortly before the tubes connecting New York and New Jersey were dug 
through, and the tunnel was an immediate success when it was opened 
to traffic in 1927. It was also loaded to capacity, for by that time the 
number of automobiles and trucks had grown to such numbers that new 
tunnels and bridges across the Hudson were already being designed, 
including the Lincoln Tunnel and the record-setting 3500-foot suspension 
bridge to be known as the George Washington Bridge, which would be 
completed in 193 1 .  The successful financing of the Hudson River cross­
ings by the Port of New York Authority, as well as that of other contem­
porary projects, by means of bonds that would be entirely repaid by the 
tolls charged to users of a tunnel or bridge, eventually helped gain final 
approval for projects like those in San Francisco. 
Unlike Charles Evan Fowler's report, which proposed an expensive 
bridge but did not make a sufficiently convincing argument that it would 
pay for itself, Michael O'Shaughnessy and Joseph Strauss's 1921 proposal 
B R I D G E S  A N D  P O L I T I C S  
175 

for a Golden Gate Bridge was a model of salesmanship. Not only was it 
better written than Fowler's bay bridge proposal, but it spelled out con­
cisely and explicitly the costs and benefits in terms readily understood by 
anyone. Though O'Shaughnessy could elicit few formal proposals other 
than Strauss's for a crossing of the Golden Gate into the relatively un­
populated northern counties, proposals for crossing the bay to the east, 
where most commuters to the city lived, were numerous. In 1921, for 
example, thirteen applications were on record seeking franchises from the 
city of San Francisco to build a bridge to Oakland or other East Bay 
communities. 
However, since San Francisco Bay wa´ ·such a strategic waterway, the 
War Department, whose approval would eventually have to be won, held 
hearings on the matter of a bridge and placed strict limitations on what 
kind of structure could be built. Among these restrictions were that no 
bridge of any kind would be approved north of a location known as 
Hunter's Point, which was south of San Francisco; that no low bridge 
would be approved north of San Mateo, which was ten miles further south 
still; and that a 3000-foot-wide open channel had to be left on the San 
Francisco side of the bay. 
The constraints imposed by the War Department, as well as the fact 
that the cost of a bridge across San Francisco Bay was expected to exceed 
that of any bridge built to that date in America, kept an easy decision from 
being made. By 1926, in addition to the cantilever design submitted by 
Fowler, seventeen proposals were before the San Francisco Board of 
Supervisors, who were being petitioned for a franchise to build a bridge 
with private funds. The designs ranged from combination tunnel and 
bridge schemes to major suspension bridges, and many of the proposals 
had associated with them the names of some of the most famous engineers 
of the time. These included J. Vipond Davies, who had been responsible 
for tunnels under the Hudson River; Ralph Modjeski, who was chief 
engineer for the suspension bridge then beiii.g completed across the 
Delaware River at Philadelphia, as well as many other bridges; George 
Washington Goethals, who had become famous as the engineer who 
finally completed the Panama Canal and who was advocating a tunnel 
scheme in New York; J. A. L. Waddell, the author of Bridge Engineering, 
who had built, among many others, a famous lift bridge in Chicago; and 
Gustav Lindenthal, who for almost 40 years had promoted a gigantic 
suspension bridge to carry rail and road traffic across the Hudson River

and who had designed important bridges in Pittsburgh and New York 
City. Even Joseph Strauss, who at the time was promoting his Golden 
Gate project, had designed a Sunshine Transbay Boulevard Bridge that 
was to consist of cantilever spans and a bascule crossing between Hunter's 
Point and Alemeda. Furthermore, the longer a bay bridge remained 
unbuilt, the more designs were offered, and in 1928 the number of 
proposals put forth had reached 38. 
S E L E C T I N G  A S I T E  
While there was some question as to the legality of San Francisco unilat­
erally selecting a site and having plans prepared for a toll bridge to be 
built by a private company, the city's Board of Supervisors proceeded to 
ask the presidents of four local universities to provide a list of qualified 
and disinterested bridge engineers to serve in an advisory capacity. Three 
engineers were to be selected from the list to make "a study and investi­
gation of the proper location of termini, foundations, clearance above the 
waters of the bay, space between piers, the loads which said bridge should 
carry, the facilities for traffic at both termini of said bridge, and the 
probable conditions of traffic incident to said bridge, and the financial 
problems involved." After so many years of indecision on the part of the 
city, the presidents of Berkeley, Stanford, the University of Santa Clara, 
and St. Mary's College were asked to produce a list of names within ten 
days. Since so many of the most famous bridge engineers in the country 
were already involved with the proposals that had been put forth, the list 
submitted contained names that might not have been immediately recog­
nized. However, a distinguished board was appointed, made up of Robert 
Ridgeway from New York, Arthur N. Talbot from the University of Illinois, 
and John D. Galloway from San Francisco. 
The board of engineers was given only 30 days to deliberate, and they 
came to the following conclusions in a report filed on May 5, 1927: 
I. The most suitable location is from Rincon Hill to Alameda Mole 
[that is, breakwater], with a second choice from Potrero Hill to 
Alameda Mole, and a third from Telegraph Hill to Yerba Buena 
Island, thence to the Key Route Mole [as shown in Fig. 9. 7]. 
2. The longer spans should be two l,250-ft. cantilevers. 
3. Maximum grades should be 6 per cent for vehicles and 4 per cent 
for inter-urban [railway cars].

The board of engineers recognized a reliable cost estimate could not 
be made before information was available about the nature of potential 
foundation conditions beneath the bay. For all of the applications for 
franchises and preliminary design proposals that had been submitted, 
there had been remarkably little exploration of where exactly, and how 
deep, the bridge piers would be located. This should not be surprising, 
for the proposals were prepared on speculation, and few engineers or 
financial backers would have wanted to risk the time and money to explore 
the bed of the bay in any degree of detail before they had some kind of 
commitment that their efforts would have a reasonable chance of being 
rewarded. Thus, the board of engineers recommended that the city desir­
ing the bridge explore the preferred site to determine exactly what kind 
of foundations could be supported and prepare a more detailed design on 
which to base cost estimates. 
In the meantime, the War Department continued to be an obstacle. 
City officials attempted to deal with it by going to Washington to try to 
persuade army and navy authorities to relax their restrictions, and when 
I N V E N T I O N  BY 
D E S I G N

this was not effective, the city got its elected representatives in Washington 
to introduce legislation to circumvent the War Department. This was not 
successful either, and further political efforts led to the idea of proposing 
the bridge as a publicly-owned facility, which would enable it to be 
financed by revenue bonds in a manner not unlike the way the interstate 
Port of New York Authority was financing the George Washington Bridge. 
The idea of public ownership led to the notion of a governmental com­
mission to oversee the project, and in 1929 a representative of Governor 
C. C. Young enlisted the support of President Herbert Hoover, a graduate 
of Stanford and a successful mining engineer before he became involved 
in public service and politics. He soon announced the appointment of a 
San Francisco Bay Bridge Commission, which came to be known as the 
Hoover-Young Commission. Legislation also created the California Toll 
Bridge Authority and designated the Department of Public Works as its 
agent to design, construct, and operate toll bridges. It further provided for 
their financing through revenue bonds and appropriated money for pre­
liminary investigations. 
The commission put California's state highway engineer, Charles H. 
Purcell, in charge of the project. Purcell, who was born in 1883 and who 
attended Stanford and the University of Nebraska, began his engineering 
career as a bridge designer for the Oregon Highway Department and 
worked for the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads before coming to California. 
State Bridge Engineer Charles E. Andrew was given immediate charge 
of the study. A systematic investigation of possible bridge locations was 
begun, and borings were made to determine foundation conditions. De­
tailed traffic studies were also initiated, including compilations of ferry 
records, in order to have accurate and up-to-date data on which to base 
projected bridge use and toll revenues. These studies led to the clear 
conclusion that the best route for the bridge was from San Francisco's 
Rincon Hill to Coat Island, along the route of an underwater rock ridge 
that provided a base for the least deep foundations, and thence on to 
Oakland (see Fig. 9.7), even though that community had been somewhat 
reluctant to have a bridge interjected into its harbor. 
The Hoover-Young Commission received a report of the study, and by 
the middle of 1930 was able to conclude that bay bottom conditions made 
it clear that the route over Coat Island was the only technically and 
economically feasible one and that there should be no more than four 
main spans over the West Bay and that the two center spans should be 
high enough to provide a clearance of 2 14 feet over mean high water.

This part of the bridge was as technically ambitious a construction project 
as any then under way or contemplated, and yet the final design was to 
be "such that it will conform with the scenic beauty of San Francisco 
Bay." The responsibility for designing and constructing such a bridge lay 
with the California Toll Bridge Authority. 
T H E  FI N A L  D E S I G N  
With $650,000 appropriated in 1931, serious design work could begin, 
which meant that an engineering organization had to be established to 
look at the various options and details and come up with final plans so 
that War Department approval could be ³btained and construction could 
begin. Such work necessarily involves a great number of engineers, with 
different ones focusing on different aspects of the project, which in this 
case included the West and East Bay crossings, the Goat Island crossing, 
and approaches in San Francisco and Oakland. Purcell was made chief 
engineer of the entire project, Andrew was appointed bridge engineer and 
as such headed the design team, and Glenn B. Woodruff was made 
engineer of design. As with all good engineering work, an independent 
group of engineers was established to advise on and check all engineering 
assumptions and calculations. This board of consulting engineers in­
cluded Ralph Modjeski, whose Delaware River Bridge had been the 
longest when completed in 1926; the firm of Moran & Proctor, whose 
principals Daniel Moran and Carlton S. Proctor had been responsible for 
the foundations and piers of some of the country's most significant bridges; 
Leon Moisseiff, who would also work on the Golden Gate and Tacoma 
Narrows bridges; Charles Derleth, Jr., who was dean of engineering at the 
University of California in Berkeley; and Henry J. Brunnier, an established 
San Francisco consulting engineer who had been involved with many 
important West Coast structures. Consulting architects were also ap­
pointed to give advice on the physical appearance of the bridge and its 
approaches. 
The final design of a great bridge is never a simple matter, for there 
are many different factors to be considered and many conflicting objec­
tives to be met. The result is many possible designs (see Fig. 9.8), and it 
is engineering experience and judgment that play a key role in narrowing 
down the possibilities. The first design that was focused upon for the 
purposes of gaining War Department approval was a four-span symmetri­
cal cantilever arrangement, in spite of the form's history. Because the 
1700-foot spans were comparable to those of the well-considered Firth of

Forth Bridge, the feasibility of the design and the clearances for shipping 
that it could provide were virtually unquestionable, and thus the critical 
approval was finally obtained. Any subsequent design changes that would 
be found desirable for technical or economic reasons would then be less 
likely to have approval withheld. 
In fact, even before approval had been obtained for the cantilever 
design, it became clear to the engineers that a suspension bridge would 
be more economical, safer to erect, and more aesthetically pleasing. But 
exactly which suspension bridge design to adopt was still a matter of some 
thought and judgment, and required furt²er calculations and tests. 
It is always tempting for engineers to build a bridge with as long a span 
as possible, not only to have a sense of grandeur but also to reduce the 
number of obstacles in the water. Thus, a design with a single suspended 
span of 4100 feet between two towers would have been in keeping with 
the growth of suspension bridges while at the same time providing a 
structure of monumental proportions. In the end it was rejected, however, 
since it was found to be more expensive and less suited to the location 
than multiple span bridges. However, since the design of a multiple-span 
suspension bridge was indeed a departure from experience, special model 
tests were conducted by engineering professors R. E. Davis at the Univer­
sity of California and G. E. Beggs at Princeton University, in order to 
guide and check theoretical calculations about the dynamic behavior of 
such structures. In the end, these tests helped settle on a design compris­
ing two complete suspension bridges in tandem, sharing a common 
central anchorage. The main spans of 2310 feet still made each of these 
individual bridges larger than all but the George Washington Bridge 
recently completed between New York and New Jersey and the Golden 
Gate Bridge under construction across the bay, but the spans were gen­
erally considered otherwise to be relatively conventional in design. 
The crossing of Goat Island, on which there were military facilities, 
was to be through a tunnel of larger bore than any then in existence, 
making the overall project still more remarkable. As for the East Bay 
crossing, the wishes of Oakland had to be accommodated so that future 
development of its port facilities were not jeopardized by a low bridge. 
The original design calling for a main section comprising a 700-foot 
cantilever with a 161-foot clearance was modified to provide a 1400-foot 
cantilever section with a vertical clearance of 185 feet (see Fig. 9.9). Thus 
the project was to include a major cantilever span that would be the third

Cantilever span under construction over East Bay 
largest in the world, ranking only behind the Firth of Forth and Quebec 
bridges. 
The total cost of $75 million for the entire San Francisco-Oakland Bay 
Bridge was just what Fowler had estimated for his design, and the overall 
project was to include "the greatest bridge yet erected by the human race," 
according to ex-President Hoover, who spoke at ceremonies marking the 
beginning of construction in mid-1933. Chief engineer Purcell said he 
hoped to see traffic using the bridge by the beginning of 19 3 7. In fact, 
construction would proceed ahead of schedule, and the bridge would be 
opened in 1936 (see Fig. 9. 10), well before the Golden Gate Bridge. In 
1955, when it was almost 20 years old, the San Francisco-Oakland Bay 
Bridge was named by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of 
the seven great modern civil engineering wonders of the United States.

The construction of the Bay Bridge was well documented in photographs, 
and though the bridge is their clear focus, it is difficult to overlook the 
large number of ferries that are in the background of so many of the shots 
of construction workers and the partially completed structure. By the 
1930s commuter traffic across the bay had grown to such a volume that

Treasure Island, which was created as the site of the 1939 Golden Gate International 
Exposition commemorating the completion of the Golden Gate and Bay bridges 
criss-crossing ferry boats making as many as 500 trips per day presented 
more of a hazard to navigation than did a limited number of bridge piers 
in the water. With the completion of the Bay Bridge, the Golden Gate, 
and other area bridges, ferry service naturally declined, and automobile 
traffic in and out of San Francisco became a much more convenient 
experience -until traffic volume grew to such a magnitude that the 
bridges themselves became choked with rush hour traffic. Building addi­
tional bridges today is considered financially prohibitive, not to mention 
environmentally threatening, and so ferry service has been reintroduced 
to relieve bridge traffic. 
The Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District, which 
developed as an independent entity as a direct result of engineer Strauss's 
political savvy and promotional skill, has developed alternative and inno­
vative ways to alleviate congestion. For example, in 1968 the Golden Gate 
became the first bridge to collect tolls in one direction only. Under the 
assumption that the great bulk of users cross a bridge both ways, dou­
bling the toll and collecting it only one way makes incontrovertible sense, 
and many toll bridges, including the Bay Bridge, have since adopted 
I N V E N T I O N  BY 
D E S I G N  
184 

this practice. In 1970 the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transporta­
tion District introduced a new ferry service between San Francisco and 
Sausalito, to further reduce traffic and congestion on the bridge. 
When the required traffic capacity of the Bay Bridge was considered 
prior to design, it became clear that a single-deck bridge would have had 
to be about 100 feet wide, requiring a very strong and stiff floor structure. 
A double-deck roadway, approximately one third less wide, was found to 
result in considerable savings, and so it was adopted. 
Other factors also affected the final design of the double-deck roadway. 
For example, as originally conceived, two interurban railway tracks would 
have been carried over or under the single vehicular roadway, but the 
double-deck concept made it possible to carry both sets of rapid transit 
rails more efficiently on the same level as truck traffic. Furthermore, the 
tracks were laid out side by side on the bridge's lower deck, even though 
this created the complication of a somewhat asymmetrical load on the 
structure. This kind of engineering decision was made to take into ac­
count more than just structural response to the loads, however. Locating 
the two rail lines symmetrically on opposite sides of the bridge would have 
meant that the vehicle traffic between them would have been interrupted 
and made more dangerous whenever trains had to cross over from one 
rail line to the other, which would be necessitated by repairs, accidents, 
and other circumstances. Commuter trains operated on the lower deck 
of the bridge until the late 1950s, when they were removed because 
ridership had dropped. The upper and lower roadways were then each 
dedicated to one-way traffic. 
B R I D G E S  A N D  E A R T H Q U A K E S  
In the San Francisco Bay area a design consideration more critical than 
the arrangement of traffic lanes and commuter railroad tracks is the 
possibility of an earthquake moving the ground beneath the foundations 
of any structure, including a great bridge. If its traffic-carrying capacity is 
to be maintained under such abnormal circumstances, the bridge must 
be designed to withstand a certain amount of shaking. But how much 
extra strength a structure must have to withstand an earthquake is a matter 
of engineering judgment that must be tempered with economic reality. 
This means that reasonable assumptions about the size and characteristics 
of the kind of earthquake that is likely to strike during the lifetime of the 
bridge must be made. In the case of the Bay Bridge, Chief Engineer 
Purcell, in an article in Civil Engineering in 1934 describing the project 
B R I D G E S  A N D  P O L I T I C S  
1 8 5  

when it was under way, revealed how earthquake resistance was built into 
the design: 
All elements of the bridge are designed for an acceleration of the support­
ing material of 10 per cent thćt of gravity. It was readily recognized that 
the usual criteria for earthquake design would not be satisfactory in dealing 
with this structure. In view of this, an exhaustive study was made and 
design methods were evolved which took into consideration the various 
peculiarities of the problem. 
In the case of the channel piers, the horizontal force created by the 
acceleration of the mass will be augmented by forces due to the movement 
of the pier through the water and the soft mud immediately below. In fact 
it is conceivable that the soft mud may have an acceleration of its own in 
a direction opposite to that of the pier. These forces were incorporated in 
the analysis. In dealing with the superstructure, and particularly the sus­
pension spans, the elastic and mechanical flexibility of the elements were 
fully considered. For earthquake design a 40 per cent increase in basic unit 
stress was permitted. 
The same differences in character between the San Francisco-Goat 
Island crossing and the Goat Island-Oakland crossing that had necessi­
tated two completely different kinds of structural design also turned out 
to complicate the attempt to design the Bay Bridge to withstand earth­
quakes. The West Bay section of the bridge would rest on bedrock, while 
the East Bay section would sit on mud that is vulnerable to seismic 
movement. It is this mud to which Purcell was referring in his description 
of the design problem. 
In engineering-science courses like strength of materials and dynamics, 
engineering students learn to calculate the effects of loads and motion on 
structural elements. Working problems and exercises in these areas pre­
pares engineers for the kinds of calculations alluded to by Purcell. How­
ever, unlike in textbook problems, where all the loads and conditions are 
clearly specified to give the student a well-defined example for analysis, 
in real design problems like those that faced the engineers of the Bay 
Bridge, the clearly essential and critical assumptions regarding what the 
basic accelerations moving the bridge will be and what additional strength 
it should have to resist them must be made as part of the calculations and 
design itself. 
Because knowledge of the nature of earthquakes is largely empirical 
and historical, it becomes a matter of judgment as to what conditions will 
be designed for. As the earthquake of 1989 subsequently demonstrated, 
I N V E N T I O N  BY 
D E S I G N  
1 86 

the design of the Bay Bridge was in fact not without its limitations, as a 
section of the upper roadway fell onto the lower, causing death and injury 
to motorists on the span at the time and closing the bridge to all traffic. 
The resulting inconvenience to commuters in the 260,000 vehicles that 
used the bridge each day demonstrated very forcefully not only the key 
role that the bridge played in bay area traffic patterns but also the vulner­
ability of all structures to key design decisions made decades earlier. 
Because the bridge was so important a traffic link across the bay, the 
repairs were completed with great speed and deliberation. The California 
Department of Transportation (known as Caltrans), which is responsible 
for all of California's toll bridges except the Golden Gate Bridge, reopened 
the Bay Bridge only 30 days after the earthquake. Subsequent analyses of 
the bridge suggested that the East Bay portion might have to be replaced 
entirely, and the total cost of all work needed may be as high as $1. 3 
billion. 
By understanding the long history of a project like the San Francisco-­
Oakland Bay Bridge, not only do we better understand why its behavior 
in an earthquake is what it is but also we realize that the engineering and 
other decisions that went into its design and construction are really only 
fully meaningful in the context of engineering projects that preceded and 
were contemporary with it. Engineering cannot take place in a social or 
technical vacuum, and thus the forces that shape any given engineering 
project are the same forces that shape the other news and world events 
that are taking place simultaneously. While engineers should never be 
ignorant of or ignore the technical aspects of engineering that are funda­
mental to a project and that give it its unique character, these technical 
aspects make up only part of any engineering problem, which is an 
invariably complex human endeavor. Every engineering effort is shaped 
by, and in turn shapes, the culture, politics, and times in which it is 
embedded.

When the architect Le Corbusier called ·a house "a machine for living 
in," he drew attention to the fact that modern buildings are more than 
structures with facades. They are made up of many parts that must fit 
together and work together in order to provide not only shelter and status 
but also comfort in a controlled environment. Our homes have heating 
and cooling systems, and electrical systems to make them function. The 
larger buildings in which people make travel connections and work have 
more elaborate systems, which might include those for horizontal and 
vertical means of transportation comprising many interconnected moving 
sidewalks, escalators, and elevators. Where government or industrial se­
crets are involved, and in politically sensitive areas, there may have to be 
security systems linked to state-of-the-art surveillance equipment. 
Though older buildings may not have had the same kinds of systems 
with which they are now so often retrofitted, that is not to say that older 
buildings did not also have to be built with systems in mind, for no 
complex building project can proceed very effectively without them. Not 
all systems involve mechanical, electrical, and computer hardware, and 
some of the most effective systems of ancient times were more sociological 
than technical. The great pyramids of Egypt, for example, required enor­
mous systems of labor organization for their building, which in tum 
depended upon now incompletely understood systems of moving great 
quantities of massive blocks of stone. The design of the pyramids also 
incorporated systems of passages and chambers carefully laid out to thwart 
would-be tomb robbers. 
In later centuries, when giant obelisks were removed from Egypt or 
relocated in cities like Rome, the operation had to be carefully planned 
and the muscle power of hundreds, if not thousands, of men and animals 
had to be coordinated into a smoothly functioning system (Fig. 1 0. 1  ) . 
While an obelisk itself might be considered a primitive building with no

Elaborate method devised for moving the Vatican Obelisk 
internal systems, if improperly handled and not supported in an appropri­
ate way, it was as liable as any machine to break. Gothic cathedrals were, 
of course, much more elaborate structural systems, with vaulted ceilings 
and flying buttresses. However, beyond those dominant mechanical fea­
tures and the sociological systems that were required for their sometimes 
centuries-long financing and construction, the great cathedrals did not 
generally have to meet the tight design, scheduling, or environmental 
requirements of modern buildings.

What might be considered one of the greatest-ever public buildings to 
require systems thinking for both its construction and its operation was 
the building designed to house the first World's Fair, officially known as 
the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations, which was 
held in London in 185 1 .  The idea to have such an international exhibi­
tion developed naturally out of the increasingly inventive spirit and pro­
ductivity of the Industrial Revolution. By the middle of the nineteenth 
century, local and national exhibitions of the products of industrial art 
and manufacture had become commonplace, but it was the vision of the

By the late 1 980s, offshore oil platforms standing on the sea 
floor reached structural heights that made them taller than 
the highest buildings on land. The Shell Oil Company's 
Bullwinkle platform, named after the oil field in the Gulf 
of Mexico that it was designed to exploit, was taller than 
the Sears Tower, and was named by the American Society 
of Civil Engineers as the Oustanding Civil Engineering 
Achievement of 1 989. The steel structure weighed more 
than 75,000 tons and was constructed in a horizontal posi­
tion and towed in that position to its site, where it was 
launched from barges to sit in a vertical position in the deep 
water. 
What structural precautions must be taken in moving an 
off-shore platform from a horizontal to a vertical position? 
How would those differ from the precautions taken in lifting 
a stone obelisk to a vertical position? 

British to escalate the concept across national boundaries. Prince Albert 
became a staunch supporter, and with the appointment of a royal com­
mission under his chairmanship the idea was formally launched early 
in 1 850. 
The ambitious idea was to construct a temporary building in London's 
Hyde Park capable of sheltering all the displays and people under one 
roof that covered an unprecedented sixteen acres. Like many building 
projects, it began with the invitation of designs for the structure, and 245 
entries were received. The committee found none of them to be suitable 
' 
however, and so borrowed from them to propose a design of its own. But 
the committee's massive structure, complete with a dome larger than the 
great one on London's St. Paul's Cathedral, was judged impractical by 
critics. This, coupled with growing debate in Parliament over whether the 
invitation to so many foreigners to bring their goods and visit London 
would threaten not only the country's balance of trade but also the city's 
health, did not augur well for the exhibition. In such a climate, the Great 
Exhibition might never have taken place at all had a viable building plan 
not surfaced. 
Joseph Paxton was the superintendent of the gardens at Chatsworth, 
the estate of the Duke of Devonshire, and had become well know for his 
design and construction of an iron and glass greenhouse that covered an 
acre of ground, thus serving as a model for later palm houses and conser­
vatories. Paxton had also won fame for having designed and constructed 
at Chatsworth a special building in which a giant tropical water lily, which 
he named after Queen Victoria, not only bloomed but thrived. Such 
structures had to be supported by carefully controlled systems that regu­
lated water supply, humidity, heat, and light, and so Paxton had the 
experience to propose a building for the exhibition that relied upon 
systems of all kinds and yet would be buildable before the Great Exhibi­
tion's scheduled opening. Furthermore, Paxton's building would function 
well when it was full of people in the heat of the summer. His plan was 
embraced with less than a year to go before the crowds were to arrive, 
and the vast wood, iron, and glass building that resulted became known 
as the Crystal Palace (Fig. 10.2). 
The first system that made it all possible was the strucrure's design and 
method of construction. The temporary building employed standardized 
and reusable columns, girders, and roof components, which could be 
effectively manufacrured and assembled. The construction management 
system was efficient; for example, at the beginning of construction the site

The Crystal Palace of 1 8 5 1 ,  erected in London's Hyde Park 
was fenced off with the same boards that would in the end be taken down 
and installed as flooring in the building. A drainage system was laid out, 
and the building's hollow columns were erected atop it so that they could 
carry rainwater from the cleverly designed ridge-and-furrow roof directly 
into the drains. The spacing between all columns was to be either 24 feet 
or a multiple of that distance, and there were standardized means of 
connection. Erection was completed in 17 weeks. In essence, the frame 
building was constructed of prefabricated parts, and the roof could be 
installed at the same time the walls were being hung. This feature, that 
the walls were not required to support the building, came to be known as 
curtain-wall construction, and it is used in all modern skyscrapers. 
Constructing the 1850-foot-long Crystal Palace was one thing; having 
it work as a machine with as many as 90,000 people moving about inside 
was another. With the structure completed, critics who argued that the 
building would blow down in the wind or that its galleries would collapse 
under the weight of crowds were silenced, but it remained to be seen 
whether the enclosed space would not be as stifling as a hot house. Paxton 
anticipated such concerns by designing air circulation and heat control 
I N V E N T I O N  BY 
D E S I G N  
192 

systems. Wall panels were louvered for ventilation, and large canvas roof 
covers were designed to shade the interior. Water evaporating from these 
even provided a kind of air conditioning. Anticipating cleaning problems, 
Paxton designed the flooring to have spaces between the boards so that 
litter could be swept into the crawl space beneath. Since this would have 
produced a fire hazard, Paxton planned the space to accommodate boys 
who would collect the litter on a regular basis. With such systems in place, 
the Crystal Palace and the Great Exhibition that it housed were a tremen­
dous success. 
After the exhibition closed, many Londoners wanted to keep the build­
ing permanently in Hyde Park, but the agreement had been to restore the 
park to its prior state. Thus the original Crystal Palace was disassembled, 
as it had been designed to be, and it was reerected on a still larger scale 
south of the city, in an area known as Sydenham, where it served for over 
80 years as the centerpiece of a recreational and cultural retreat from the 
city proper. A fire in 1866 destroyed the building's north transept, and in 
1936 the building, with its many flammable contents, caught fire and 
burned down completely. But the influence of the Crystal Palace on 
engineering, architecture, and building systems generally continues to 
this day. 
T O W E R S  A N D  E L E V A T O R S  
Before it was agreed to reconstruct the Crystal Palace at Sydenham, 
various proposals were put forth for reusing the structural materials. 
Among them was to construct a tower 1000 feet high, which its proposer 
pointed out would be an economical use of land and from the top of 
which the view would no doubt have been spectacular. Though limited 
space is certainly one of the reasons skyscrapers have come to be so 
popular in crowed cities, the idea of so tall a tower in the 1 850s had the 
serious drawback of how to transport people from the ground to the top. 
Anyone who has climbed the stairs to the top of the Statue of Liberty or 
the Washington Monument, neither of which is nearly so tall, knows that 
such a proposition would have limited appeal and would not likely have 
repaid its investment in tourist trade. 
The difficulty of getting to the top of tall structures was clearly one 
factor in keeping them from being built. In the wake of the success of the 
Great Exhibition, other large cities held their own international exhibi­
tions, often in crystal palaces of modified design. The one in New York 
in 1853 was in a cruciform iron-and-glass structure topped by a dome 168 
B U I L D I N G S  A N D  S Y S T E M S  
193 

feet high. An alternative building proposal for that exhibition had been 
put forward by the mechanical and structural engineer James Bogardus, 
who was a proponent of cast-iron 'buildings. He had wanted to erect a 
300-foot-high cast-iron tower that would have transported visitors to the 
top in a steam elevator. Elevators in use at the time were installed mainly 
for transporting freight and were operated by hydraulic power, much the 
way an automobile lift is in a garage today. It was not uncommon for a 
hydraulic cylinder to fracture or a lifting rope to break on early elevators, 
and having people free-falling from a few stories, let alone a 300-foot 
tower, was naturally of some concern. 
What changed the perception of elevators was a demonstration by one 
of Bogardus's contemporaries at the same exhibition that rejected his 
tower. Elisha Graves Otis was a mechanical engineer who developed a 
safety device that would check an elevator's fall if the supporting rope or 
cable broke. At the New York exhibition, Otis had constructed a frame 
and elevator in which he was hoisted some distance above the ground 
(Fig. 10.3). When an assistant, in clear view of all onlookers, dramati­
cally cut the supporting rope, the elevator dropped only a small distance 
before being stopped by the new safety feature. By 1857 a hydraulic 
passenger elevator was installed in a five-story store on Broadway, and in 
time the idea of elevators in buildings was commonplace. While Bogar­
dus, Otis, and others had developed steam-powered elevators, in general 
that power supply was used to drive pumps for hydraulic plunger-type 
elevators in which a piston was set deep into the ground beneath the 
elevator shaft. This arrangement clearly imposed practical height limita­
tions. Nevertheless, New York's famous Flatiron Building, with about 20 
stories, had hydraulic elevators operating into the last decades of the 
twentieth century. 
With the advent of elevators, the practical limits to the height of a 
building were no longer defined by how many flights people were able 
or willing to walk up but rather by the structural limitations of how tall 
a building could be constructed. The standard methods of construction 
employed masonry walls as the principal means of support. Since all stone 
has a limit as to how much weight can be piled upon it before it crushes, 
taller masonry structures required walls which, at least near ground level, 
had to be prohibitively thick. The advent of iron-framed structures, such 
as those pioneered by Paxton and Bogardus, in conjunction with the con­
cept of a curtain wall, removed these limitations and opened up new pos­
sibilities. As the end of the nineteenth century approached, the use of cast

iron, wrought iron, and finally steel in construction was becoming more 
and more common, and so taller and taller structures came to be built. 
It was possible in the mid-l 880s, for example, to erect the copper shell 
of the Statue of Liberty to its full 1 5 1-foot height atop its pedestal in New 
York Harbor because it was supported by a wrought iron frame designed 
by the French bridge engineer Gustav Eiffel. Eiffel is, of course, more 
commonly associated with the Paris tower that bears his name. Like the 
Crystal Palace, that tower had its origins in the planning for an interna­
tional exhibition. The 1889 Exposition Universelle was to be held to 
commemorate the French Revolution, and a suitably distinctive monu­
ment was sought for the occasion. Two engineers working in Eiffel's firm, 
Maurice Koechlin and Emile Nouguier, came up with the idea of a 
300-meter (about 1000-foot) tall tower made of wrought iron. When they 
first showed their concept to Eiffel, he expressed little enthusiasm. How­
ever, after Stephen Sauvestre, an architect with the firm, added some 
embellishments, Eiffel embraced the idea and eventually a patent on the 
structural design was secured (Fig. 10.4). 
Resisting wind forces was the main structural challenge in designing 
what came to be known as the Eiffel Tower, but some of the systems that 
were incorporated into it were also essential for its success. For example, 
it was clearly imperative that the tower be raised on a true vertical, which 
taxed the technology of the time. To ensure that things would not get out 
of alignment, a system of hydraulic jacks was incorporated into the four 
comer bases, so that corrections could be made as the tower rose. Com­
pleting the tower structure would have been a feat in itself, but if people 
could not be efficiently transported to its top there would be no significant 
income to repay its cost. Thus, considerable effort went into designing 
the elaborate elevator system, which had to traverse not only the vertical 
central spire but also the inclined structural legs that gave the tower its 
stiffness in the wind. The multiple component double-decker elevator 
system that moves people to the various levels of the Eiffel Tower remains 
a masterpiece of planning and was largely responsible for making the 
tower enough of a profitable venture and popular attraction that it has 
stood in Paris well beyond its originally intended purpose as a symbol of 
an exposition.

The term skyscraper came to be used in the 1880s to describe buildings 
in Chicago that reached heights of ten to sixteen stories. Though these 
B U I L D I N G S  A N D  S Y S T E M S  
197 

structures were awe-inspiring in their time, they tend to look squat by to­
day's standards, having horizontal dimensions comparable to their heights, 
and they were nowhere near the height of the Eiffel Tower. In the 
twentieth century, tall buildings began to rise to much greater heights 
than their street level width. Among the most notable of the early-twen­
tieth-century skyscrapers was the Woolworth Building in New York City. 
The cost of the 191 3 structure was a staggering $ 1 3  million, which 
represented but one of many of the nontechnical obstacles to building 
skyscrapers. However, in this case the building was paid for in cash by its 
owner. The strong-willed, self-made Frank W. Woolworth had become 
wealthy on the basis of his "five and ten cent" retail stores that at the time 
were doing $100 million in annual sales. 
With the financing of the Woolworth Building assured, the detailed 
problems of design could be faced. Woolworth dictated certain criteria to 
the architect, Cass Gilbert, for what came to be called the Cathedral of 
Commerce (Fig. 10.5). The 20-foot-high Gothic ceilings of some floors 
made the building's 60 stories belie its height of 792 feet above the ground. 
More traditional ceiling heights would have given the building almost 80 
stories. Several of the Woolworth Building's floors were actually below the 
ground, calling attention to one .of the first problems faced in designing 
such structures: the foundation system. A foundation that will support the 
heavy weight of the building without uneven settling is essential for a 
stable structure that will not tilt or crack over time. 
The foundations of the Woolworth Building, which was estimated to 
weigh a total of about 223,000 tons, were constructed through soil, mud, 
silt, and water to the bedrock that defines Manhattan Island. To reach an 
average depth of 1 10 feet below street level, an excavation and construc­
tion system employing pneumatic caissons was used. These were large 
inverted steel cylinders, opened at one end like an empty food can, so 
that they would trap air much the way an inverted glass does in a tub of 
water. By adding the right amount of air pressure (the pneumatic part), 
the water through which the excavation proceeded could be kept at a 
sufficiently low level so that workmen could move the soil, dirt, and loose 
rocks to reach the firm bedrock. Such procedures, while potentially 
dangerous because of the compressed air environment, were familiar in 
construction, especially in large bridge-building projects. 
By contrast, the problems presented by the interior of the Woolworth 
Building were unique to the twentieth century. These included installing 
the mechanical and electrical systems needed to make a skyscraper func-

tion properly. For example, the Woolworth Building, with 87 miles of 
electrical wiring, was the first to have its own power plant, which consisted 
of four generators capable of producing enough electricity to satisfy the 
needs of a small city. As part _of the building's opening ceremonies, its 
80,000 light bulbs were simultaneously lighted when President Woodrow 
Wilson threw a switch in the White House. The copper roofs of the 
building were connected via copper cables to the steel· skeleton in order 
to ground it against lightning strikes. 
S K Y S C R A P E R S  A N D  E L E V A T O R S  
When the Woolworth Building opened in 191 3, its elevator system was 
state of the art. Two of the fastest elevators in the building could cover 
the 700 feet from the street to the 54th floor in the record time of just 
one minute. But a total of 26 elevators was needed to serve the 30 acres 
of office space in the building, and the shafts in which these elevators 
moved took up valuable floor space. For future skyscrapers, whose financ­
ing would depend on how much rental income could be realized from 
the building, every additional elevator shaft required might threaten the 
project's future. 
The Woolworth Building remained the' world's tallest until 1930, when 
the 1046-foot tall Art Deco-style Chrysler Building was completed. It in 
tum held the record for only one year. The Empire State Building, like 
the Crystal Palace, was a model construction project. It took only fourteen 
months to construct, and yet for over 40 years the 1250-foot tall building 
( 1414 feet when the television tower was added) would hold the record 
as the tallest building in the world. While the distance to the 102nd-floor 
observatory was not nearly twice that to the top of the Woolworth Building, 
the Empire State had almost three times as many elevators. Indeed, the 
problem of moving people vertically in the tallest buildings has been 
among the most significant factors in limiting their height. In the mid­
l 990s, over 60 years after the opening of the Empire State Building, its 
height remained within 10 percent of that of the world's tallest buildings, 
the World Trade Center Towers ( 1 368 and 1 362 feet tall) in New York 
and the Sears Tower ( 1454 feet) in Chicago (Fig. 10.6), completed in 
1973 and 1974, respectively. 
The fastest elevators in the Empire State Building were about twice as 
fast as those in the Woolworth Building. By the mid-l 990s the fastest 
elevators in the world, operating at almost 2400 feet/minute, were those 
installed in the 70-story Landmark Tower in Yokahama, then Japan's tallest

F I G U R E 1 0.7 Building volume occupied by single- and double-deck elevators, as a 
function of floors in a skyscraper 
building. As elevators get faster, however, problems of alignment, noise, 
and safety grow. Improved roller guides, streamlined and soundproofed 
cars, and advanced ceramic safety brake shoes are among some of the new 
features incorporated into the Landmark Tower elevator system. 
But speed is only one aspect of the elevator problem. In the typical 
100-floor skyscraper, about 30 percent of floor space is devoted to elevators 
and their appurtenances, such as lobbies and machinery rooms. Some 
floor space can be saved by employing double-deck elevators (see Fig. 
l 0. 7) or operating multiple elevators in a single shaft. No matter how 
much space it consumes, elevator capacity remains essential not only to 
move people quickly and conveniently during rush hours but also for 
evacuating skyscrapers during emergencies, and alternatives to conven­
tional approaches are developing. By 1996 the basic height of the Sears 
Tower (without its antennas) was surpassed by the 1476-foot tall (about 
95-floor) Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (Cesar Pelli, 
architect; Thornton-Tomasetti, structural engineers). A connecting sky­
bridge (Fig. 10.8) enables workers and visitors to move between the towers

Another concern in elevator design is the length of the ropes and cables 
supporting the elevator. As they grow longer they begin to add substantial 
weight to the system. For this and other reasons, elevator engineers are 
developing elevators in which the cable is eliminated entirely. Among 
these is a system in which multiple elevator cars are moved in a continu­
ous circuit powered by permanent magnets and linear synchronous mo­
tors, as suggested in Fig. 1 0.9-an idea not unlike that of a Ferris wheel.

At the same time that buildings have grown taller, they have grown 
relatively lighter and hence more flexible. Such evolutionary develop­
ments are natural in engineering, and they can be traced in the history 
I N V E N T I O N  B Y  D E S I G N  
204 

of bridges, airplanes, and structures generally. These trends are driven 
principally by economics, but there are also related aesthetic and func­
tional considerations. A lighter-framed skyscraper, for example, can be 
sleeker looking architecturally and can have more floor space and window 
area, which makes it more attractive to potential tenants. However, if the 
building is too flexible, the perceptible motion of the upper floors can be 
disconcerting to the occupants, who might see pictures tilt on the walls 
or coffee slosh around in the cup on their desk. 
The design of skyscrapers has evolved with the development of novel 
structural systems and computer-based analysis. Such concepts did not 
exist when the Empire State Building was designed, and so it is by today's 
standards a very massive and stiff structure. Indeed, in 1945 when an 
airplane crashed full speed into the building during foggy weather, the 
building suffered relatively minor structural damage. Nevertheless, even 
the stiffest tall building has a degree of flexibility, and before the spate of 
tall building construction in the 1960s and 1970s, it was a matter of debate 
among visitors to the observation deck as to whether the top of the Empire 
State Building really could sway a foot or two in the wind. 
The John Hancock Tower on Copley Square in Boston is not nearly 
as tall as the Empire State Building, but it has an unusual floor plan that 
made it susceptible to being twisted by the wind, something that was not 
anticipated by the architect, Henry Cobb of I. M. Pei & Partners, or the 
structural designers. At first, the repeated twisting and other building 
motion was thought to have caused the building's large window panes to 
fall out onto the square below, posing a considerable safety hazard. But 
the heating and cooling of the glass itself was found to be the culprit. 
After the building's problems were properly diagnosed, the windows were 
redesigned, and the twisting was dealt with by installing on the 58th floor 
a system of computer-controlled hydraulic actuators attached to two 300-
ton blocks of dead weight that could counter any undesired motion in 
much the same way we can check the movement of a playground swing 
by throwing our body weight around in a contrary fashion. The system 
installed in the John Hancock Tower is known as a tuned mass damper 
(Fig. 10. 10), a system that has been installed in other tall buildings as part 
of their design. When a certain degree of motion is detected by sensors, 
a pump is activated to float a massive block on a film of oil, thus allowing 
it to slide relative to the building in accordance with the motion of the 
programmed actuators to which it is connected.

proper was the Citicorp Center, completed in 1977 in New York City. 
After it was decided to build this corporate tower between Fifty-third 
and Fifty-fourth Streets, directly across Lexington Avenue from Citicorp's 
headquarters, it was found that a tum-of-the-century church located on 
one corner had to be accommodated. In exchange for the air rights to 
build above it, the old church was to be tom down and a new one erected 
in its place as part of the Citicorp Center complex. The 914-foot tall 
skyscraper itself was designed by the architect Hugh Stubbins to rest on 
four columns that rose up nine stories from the street. The tower was 
cantilevered out over the four open corners, into one of which was tucked 
the church, to rise another 50 stories with a square floor plan. The top of 
the building was given a distinctive slanted profile. Because of the unusual 
shape of its structural skeleton (Fig. 10. 1 1  ), the Citicorp Tower was de-

signed from the beginning to contain a 400-ton tuned mass damper to 
reduce motion induced by the wind, and this inspired the system installed 
in the Hancock Tower in Boston. 
The main resistance against the wind comes from a skyscraper's struc­
tural system itself, of course, and designing Citicorp's was especially tricky. 
The consulting structural engineer for the project wa.s William LeMes­
surier, whose firm also designed the tuned mass damper in Boston's 
Hancock building. LeMessurier devised a unique system of cross bracing 
to transfer the gravity and wind loads from the tower to the four columns 
on which it rested (Fig. 10. 1 1  ). The טain steel components of the 
building were to be welded together to form a rigid frame, but as LeMes­
surier discovered after the building was completed and occupied, bolts 
had been used instead of the more expensive welding. Such design 
changes are common in the course of taking a project from conceptual 
design to construction, and the substitution of bolts for welding was 
approved by LeMessurier's office. However, because of the unusual way 
in which the Citicorp structure had to resist the wind, LeMessieur later 
found that the bolts had not been designed for the worst-case condition, 
and elaborate emergency welding had to be done before the building was 
subjected to dangerous winds. The story of the retrofitting was largely 
unknown to the public until 1995, when it was told in a New Yorker 
magazine story.

A tube derives its resistance to bending from the fact that the main 
supporting material is concentrated around the periphery rather than at 
the center of the structure. This principle lies behind the design of the 
diagonally braced John Hancock Center in Chicago (Fig. 10. 12), com­
pleted in 1969. This landmark building was conceived by the structural 
engineer Fazlur Khan in conjunction with the architect Bruce Graham 
and engineers and architects in the firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. 
The Sears Tower (Fig. 10.6), also designed by Graham and Khan and 
completed five years later, carried the concept a step further by employing 
nine bundled tubes, each reinforcing the resistance of the others to 
bending in the wind. Many very tall building designs that have been 
subsequently proposed have made use of variations of the tube or bundled 
tube concept. 
The twin towers of the World Trade Center (Fig. 10. 1 3) were designed 
for the Port of New York Authority by the architect Minoru Yamasaki and

the engineering firm of Skilling Helle Christiansen & Robertson. Com­
pleted in 1973, the towers house remarkably versatile office space because 
of the tube concept. In each of the 209-foot square towers the 60-foot-long 
floor beams span the distance from the columns of the external wall to 
the stiff elevator core, thus providing an open space that is very flexible. 
To move the enormous numbers of people in and out and up and down 
the towers, 2 30 passenger elevators were designed to operate in a system 
of lower-, middle-, and upper-floor zones interconnected by skylobbies 
where people would transfer from one set of elevators to another. 
Wind loads as high as 45 pounds per square foot were considered in 
the structural design of the World Trade Center towers. As has become 
standard with tall buildings, model tests were conducted in a wind tunnel 
in order to confirm theoretical and computer calculations. There were 
also considerations of how the wind channeled to blow between the towers 
might affect their behavior. The design proved to be remarkably success­
ful, but when an excessively strong hurricane threatened New York City 
about 20 years after the World Trade Center had been opened, promising 
to subject the towers to more wind force than they had yet experienced, 
they were evacuated as a precaution. The hurricane did not strike with 
its full force, but as it turned out the strength of the towers would be tested 
in an even less predictable way. 
As with skyscrapers generally, there were numerous sub-basement lev­
els beneath the World Trade Center to accommodate mechanical equip­
ment and parking for the cars of the many workers in and visitors to the 
towers. Shortly after noon on Friday, February 26, 1993, a tremendous 
explosion in the underground garage caused floors to collapse and smoke 
to rise in the soon darkened and powerless north tower. A truck full of 
explosives had been parked near some of the outside columns of the 
structure, apparently in the hope that the blast would bring down the 
second tallest building in the world, and bring attention and satisfaction 
to the terrorist group responsible. While the tower structure itself proved 
able to resist the attack, the collapse of the sub-basement floors left some 
columns dangerously unbraced, and shoring them up became the first 
order of business as soon as the damage was assessed (Fig. 10.14). 
Before the structural damage could be fully determined, however, there 
were tens of thousands of occupants to evacuate. With the power out and 
the elevators immobilized, some people had to make their way down 
scores of flights of darkened, smoke-filled stairways. Others were trapped 
in elevators for hours, and some of them were filling up with smoke rising

gency bracing of columns 
in the shafts. Among those trapped in elevators were some engineers 
associated with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the present 
name of the owner of the World Trade Center as well as of many of the 
bridges that could be seen from its offices high in the north tower. One 
elevator that was stuck near the 58th Floor held the Port Authority's chief 
engineer, Eugene Fasullo, who knew the building inside and out because 
he had worked on its design. After prying open the elevator doors, the 
trapped occupants found themselves facing a blank wall. Fasullo knew 
that cutting through the heavy-duty wall board would take them into some 
public space from which they could reach stairs, and so they scratched, 
scraped, and dug with the few implements they had available-keys, paper 
clips, nail cutters, and the panel from the elevator's console. After three 
hours, the group cut a hole large enough to crawl through to a restroom 
and thus escaped to safety. 
Upon reaching the ground, Chief Engineer Fasullo immediately began 
to help assess the damage, and he soon became somewhat of a celebrity 
not only because of his determined escape but also because of his knowl­
edgeable position with regard to the condition of the building and its 
I N V E N T I O N  B Y  D E S I G N

systems. His forthrightness and articulateness during numerous news con­
ferences in subsequent days and weeks kept the public informed of the 
nature of the damage and the progress of its repair. Due in large part to 
Fasullo and his colleagues, the World Trade Center was repaired and 
reopened in a remarkably short time, but with much enhanced security 
and much restricted access to underground spaces. 
Terrorism is a very difficult thing to design against, in part because a 
particular size bomb blast must be chosen as a "design blast," and no 
matter how large the most credible blast might be, an even larger one 
might become feasible after a structure is built. Natural events like hur­
ricanes and earthquakes can also only be designed against to a degree. 
The historical record over a period of, say, fifty or a hundred years may 
serve as the basis for establishing what constitutes the worst storm to expect 
during the anticipated lifetime of a building. This may serve as a design 
basis, but there will always be the outside chance that a greater storm will 
occur. Earthquakes present even more critical design decisions, and ex­
perience has shown that although past earthquakes in a region had certain 
characteristics that could serve as a basis for rational design of structures 
like skyscrapers and bridges, the earth still moves in mysterious ways and 
holds many surprises as to the magnitude and direction of those move­
ments. The Northridge Earthquake that struck the Los Angeles area in 
1994, for example, occurred along a previously unknown geological fault 
and produced uncharacteristically large vertical ground motions. This, in 
part, accounted for the unexpectedly large amount of damage to bridges 
and steel-framed buildings, which had therefore generally been thought 
to resist earthquakes better than masonry and concrete ones.

Though terrorist blasts and natural disasters might test a large building to 
its limits, more everyday considerations can often determine its long-term 
success or failure as a complex system comprising many subsystems. 
Climate control inside a modem building is very important, and the 
development of air conditioning has often been given much credit for the 
commercial growth of such famously hot and humid cities as Atlanta and 
Houston. As early as the 1920s, theaters were air-conditioned, but highrise 
buildings presented a problem because of the large volume that had to 
be cooled and the numerous bulky air ducts that were required to achieve 
the volume of air flow needed at the upper floors. The first highrise 
building to be air-conditioned effectively was the 2 1-story Milam Building 
B U I L D I N G S  A N D  S Y S T E M S  
2 1 3  

in San Antonio, Texas, in which the Carrier Engineering Corporation 
installed a 300-ton refrigeration unit in 1928. Cooled water was pumped 
throughout the building to where a series of fans blew warm air over the 
cool pipes. Water from the San Antonio River was used to cool the system's 
condenser until the practice was stopped in the 1950s, and a cooling tower 
had to be installed. 
Large cooling towers are now commonplace on large buildings, but 
when improperly operated they have been the source of confounding 
disease. One such mysterious outbreak occurred during an American 
Legion convention, hence the name Legionnaire's Disease. Other unex­
pected environmental complications of modern buildings have developed 
in offices whose windows were permanently sealed so that the heating 
and cooling systems could better control the climate inside. This led to 
improper ventilation, in some cases combined with toxic fumes given off 
by synthetic materials and solvents, that have given the occupants head­
aches, nausea, and skin rashes. The final outcome in a few cases has been 
an unoccupiable "sick building." 
With the completion of more and more very tall buildings holding as 
many occupants as there are in a good-sized city, it has also become 
increasingly clear that huge buildings have a profound environmental 
impact on the community in which they are located. The sheer volume 
of people and the services they demand can tax all sorts of systems, 
including transportation, mail, telephone, and public health. The World 
Trade Center, for example, must accommodate about 50,000 employees 
and 80,000 visitors daily, which at any given time give it the population 
of a major city and all the attendant complexities. As with all engineering 
designs, the successful building is one in which all sorts of complications 
and interactions of the main system and its various subsystems, and their 
impact on and interaction with the environs and its systems, are properly 
anticipated by their engineers.
