APPLE CERTIFIED REFURBISHED STORE
on the refurb store, along with a FAQ
guide if you want to know more about
the ins and outs of the Apple Certified 
Refurbished store.
WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN THE APPLE
CERTIFIED REFURBISHED
STORE AND THE APPLE STORE?
The Apple Certified Refurbished store sells 
gently-used products that have been
returned to the company. Apple repairs
and tests these products to make sure
they are in like-new condition. The Apple
store, however, sells only new products
that have never been opened and used.
Strangely, finding the Apple
Certified Refurbished store isn’t obvious.
On Apple.com, scroll to the very bottom 
of the page, where you’ll find a site
directory. Under Apple Store, you’ll find
a link for Refurbished and Clearance  
(go.macworld.com/dea1).
Apple also has a Clearance store  
(go.macworld.com/c1ea), which is
described as offering “discount prices
on new products,” but as of this writing, 
this store has nothing for sale.
WHAT DOES ‘CERTIFIED
REFURBISHED’ MEAN?
The items in the Apple Certified
Refurbished store are products that have
been purchased and returned by other 
customers. Apple puts these products 
through what they call a “stringent
refurbishment process” before they are 
put on the virtual shelves.
Apple says that each product is
thoroughly tested and any problematic
hardware components are replaced. The
exception is with the Apple Watch and
Apple Pencil: If these items need new 
parts, they aren’t put up for sale.
Each product goes through a quality
assurance inspection, and is also cleaned,
inspected, and repackaged with complete
documentation, cables, and anything else
that usually ships with that device. These 
products are essentially like new.
WHAT KIND OF WARRANTY 
COMES WITH AN APPLE
CERTIFIED REFURBISHED 
PRODUCT?
Apple includes a standard one-year
limited warranty. Learn more about
Apple’s hardware warranties at  
go.macworld.com/wara.
IS APPLECARE AVAILABLE 
FOR APPLE CERTIFIED
REFURBISHED PRODUCTS?
AppleCare is available. For an additional
fee, you can get two or three years of
coverage and support. Read our guide

Apple’s laptop designs are 
cornering Mac users 
BY JASON SNELL
I
t’s funny, Apple crowing about its
biggest Mac revenue year ever
(go.macworld.com/year) at a time
when there seems to be quite a bit of
unrest about the Mac out there on the
Internet. Is the Mac doing well or is the 
Mac user base frustrated at the past few 
years of Apple’s stewardship of the
platform? It might be a little bit of both.
I detailed some of Apple’s
controversial laptop design decisions
(go.macworld.com/dtal) recently. To be 
IMAGE: APPLE

10 MACWORLD JANUARY 2018
MACUSER
APPLE’S LAPTOP DESIGNS
sure, there are classes of users for whom 
the latest generation of MacBook Pro
models, introduced in October 2016, are 
appreciably worse than the previous-
generation models (go.macworld.com/
prev). But I’ve also talked to a lot of
people who have bought new MacBook 
Pros and love them.
It’s possible that this swirling
dissatisfaction with Apple’s laptop direction
has a little whiff of selection bias. People who 
are more likely to listen to Apple-focused
podcasts and read Apple-focused websites 
are probably more likely to be in more
technical fields with specific requirements that
might not be well served by Apple’s design
decisions. They’re also probably more likely
to be persnickety about the details of their
computer choices than the general public.
This doesn’t mean that the criticisms
targeted at the MacBook Pro are invalid,
though it might mean that they’re not
representative of how the entire Mac-
buying universe feels. Record Mac
revenues driven in large part by the
success of the MacBook Pro suggests that
they aren’t; then again, sales and revenue
aren’t the same as customer satisfaction.
“Customer Sat” is one of Tim Cook’s
favorite metrics. Are the people who
bought new MacBook Pros happy with
their purchases? How many of them
bought the new laptops because it had
been years since a major laptop upgrade 
and they’d take whatever they could get?
Many companies are given some leeway
from loyal customers; great sales today 
could be hiding rotten customer
satisfaction rates that lead to lower sales in
the future as people abandon the platform. 
I don’t think there’s about to be a
groundswell of disaffected MacBook Pro
owners moving to Windows, but it’s worth 
keeping in mind that record revenues
don’t tell the whole story about the long-
term health of a product line.
I have a pet theory that every design
decision Apple makes on the Mac product
line is magnified by the fact that it’s the 
only company that can make Mac
hardware. Apple does seem to like making 
opinionated product decisions that
sometimes push design to an extreme.
That can be a problem: If Apple makes an
ultra-thin keyboard with reduced travel
and questionable reliability, and puts that
keyboard on every new laptop design,
what happens if you’re a Mac laptop user 
who just can’t stand the keyboard?
Marco Arment is right when he
describes the old MacBook keyboard
design (go.macworld.com/prev) as
“completely unremarkable, in the best
possible way…neither fanatically loved nor
widely despised.” Apple’s mistake isn’t that 
it designed a clever new keyboard that
decreases travel while increasing tactile
feedback in order to make the MacBook 

JANUARY 2018 MACWORLD 11
ultra thin—it’s that it made a keyboard
without broad appeal and then forced it
into all of its new laptop designs. I love
Apple’s tendency to make bold design
decisions, but as the single hardware
vendor on the Mac platform, Apple’s
designers have a responsibility to create 
features that don’t leave users with
nowhere to turn. Better to make a
keyboard that nobody loves (but everyone 
can use) than something loved by a
quarter of users, met with indifference by 
half, and despised by the rest.
Does this sort of attitude lead to
mediocre and timid design? I suppose it
could, but another way to approach bold,
opinionated design is to offer customers
options. The iPhone SE, iPhone 7/8, iPhone 
7/8 Plus, and iPhone X are all pretty
different phones—and choice is good. This 
is why I’ve argued that
the Mac mini has value
as a “release valve” for
the Mac platform (go.
macworld.com/valv). It
frees up Apple to make
more opinionated iMacs
and Mac Pros, because
the Mac mini is always 
there as a fallback.
When I look at Mac
laptop users today,
they seem cornered
by Apple’s design
decisions. I hope that the next generation
of MacBook and MacBook Pro models
show a little more diversity—designs with
their own personalities and strengths and
weaknesses. The more diversity in design,
the more opportunity Apple has to make
bold product-design decisions without 
cornering its most loyal users.
My daughter’s MacBook is the first Mac
laptop I’ve bought in years. My go-to travel
laptop is still an 11-inch MacBook Air from
2013. It’s solid, with an i7 processor and a
good keyboard, but no Retina display. But
the truth is, I’ve dealt with Apple’s latest
round of laptop design decisions by
dropping out of the game altogether. Most
of the time, my “laptop” is an iPad Pro. In a
way, I suppose, it has acted as my own
sort of escape valve—and I get to choose 
which keyboard I use with it. ■

Apple’s upcoming iMac Pro might 
have an iPhone chip 
BY MICHAEL SIMON

spelunker Steven Troughton-Smith
suggests an iPhone chip might be along 
for the ride.
Troughton-Smith has gotten his hands
on Apple’s new BridgeOS 2.0 software,
which will presumably be part of the 

JANUARY 2018 MACWORLD 13
inclusion inside a $5,000 iMac already
powered by an Intel Xeon processor is 
certainly a surprise.
Troughton-Smith surmises that the
chip will be responsible for opening up
hands-free Siri support on the Mac. When
we learned the new iMac will finally allow
(go.macworld.com/talk) you to speak to 
your Mac, it was assumed that a
specialized chip like the T1 would be the 
catalyst, not a full-fledged A10 chip.
Currently, the only way to summon Apple’s 
digital assistant on a Mac is to click the
icon on the screen or Touch Bar, or set up
a keyboard shortcut. Presumably, the new 
functionality would allow users to say, 
“Hey Siri,” to activate the assistant.
The new chip will also seemingly be 
used for macOS boot and security
process, a move that “lets Apple
experiment with tighter control without the
rest of the userbase freaking out,” says
Troughton-Smith. Based on his findings,
the A10 chip could be responsible for
booting up the Intel chips, and he reckons 
that “it’s safe to assume this A10 is in
charge.” Additionally, the chip could be
used for controlling the FaceTime camera.
Apple’s new space gray iMac Pro starts
shipping in December at a starting price of
$5,000. It will be customizable with up to
18-core Intel Xeon CPUs, Radeon Pro Vega 
graphics, 128GB of RAM, and 4TB of 
storage. ■
upcoming iMac Pro’s software package. 
And while it didn’t divulge quite as
much as the HomePod firmware leak
(go.macworld.com/leak) earlier this year
that spilled the beans on the iPhone X
(go.macworld.com/1phx), it does include 
some very interesting things. Chief
among them is a reference to a version of
Apple’s A10 Fusion chip, the same silicon 
that powers the iPhone 7.
Why this matters: One of the secret
weapons that makes the iPhone so great
is Apple’s home-grown iOS chips, and it
seems to be inevitable that Apple will one
day use them to power a MacBook. In fact,
the A11 Bionic chip inside the iPhone 8 and
X is as fast as the latest 13-inch MacBook
Pros in some workloads. So, while most
people probably won’t even notice the
A10 Fusion chip in the iMac Pro, it brings
Apple one step closer to building a Mac 
that isn’t powered by an x86 chip. 
POWER MOVE
Using iOS-style processors isn’t foreign to
Apple—the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar
(go.macworld.com/mbtb) uses a T1 chip
that runs a variant of iOS—but this would 
mark the first time an A series chip
makes an appearance inside a Mac.
There has been speculation for years that
Apple has plans to use its iOS chips to
power mainstream MacBooks, but the

The Photoshop CC 2018 (go.macworld.

photo/graphic design app. It integrates 
support for emerging technologies like

macOS 10.13 and iOS 11.

welcomes newcomers by incorporating 
training directly into the app.
IN-APP LEARNING
While Adobe pioneered step-by-step
post-process recipes in its consumer
Elements line (go.macworld.com/e1em), it 
always relied on photo pros to use
documentation or tutorials to figure out the
right moves for themselves. That changes 
with Photoshop CC 2018 wherein
interactive software how-tos are now 
incorporated into the interface via the new
Learn panel. It’s not exactly the same as
Elements, where you can choose which 
photos to put through the process.
Instead, Photoshop CC 2018 provides
annotated steps using its own sample 
images covering categories like
Photography, Retouching, and Graphic
Design, each containing three to five
instructional modules. You can follow the 
steps in the example or bring up the
additional text instructions, available from
the Help icon. It would be even better if 
You can view step-by-step instructions, but only on Photoshop’s sample images.

you could start with your own photos in
the interactive examples, but it’s a step in 
the right direction.
Also new are Rich Tooltips—enhanced
labels complete with tiny graphics and
animations—that demonstrate how each
tool works, though not every tool has
annotated instructions. Perhaps Adobe will 
build out that feature so the majority of
tools have visual tips, but this is a good
start. Photoshop jockeys who know every
tool by heart, can disable the feature in the 
preferences.
EASY ACCESS TO LIGHTROOM
Photoshop users can now hook into their
Lightroom photos via the cloud, with all 
synced images
accessible from the
app’s Start screen. All
you need to do is click
on the photo you want,
and it will be imported
directly into the app.

and Adobe taketh away. How? For several
years, Photoshop has been available only
by subscription, either via the standard
Creative Cloud for $49 per month or the
Creative Cloud Photography Plan for
$9.99 per month, but Lightroom was still
available as a perpetual license. That has
changed. With Photoshop CC 2018 and a 
rebranded Lightroom Classic CC for
desktop, Lightroom is now subscription-
only. The stand-alone Lightroom 6 will
continue to be sold, but it’s the last
perpetual Lightroom version, with Adobe’s
support for camera updates coming to a
halt at the end of 2017. Photography Plan
subscribers get both Lightroom Classic CC
and a simplified, mobile-oriented, cloud-
friendly Lightroom CC (formerly Lightroom 
for mobile) with their
subscription, along
with 20GB of cloud
storage and the
Spark suite of
cloud apps.
Adobe’s Sensei

intelligence engine
also springs to life in
the Photoshop Start
screen, letting you
search directly for
untagged photos or
visual content from
your synced images. It also automatically
integrates relevant Adobe Stock content 
and instructional videos.
BRUSH REVOLUTION
Adobe has overhauled its brush
management workflow to ease and
enhance handling and organization. You 
can now drag and drop to organize
brushes and group them into folders and 
subfolders for easier, more intuitive
access. Say you’re working on a painting
for which you have gathered a specific
brush collection, you can now access all 
those brushes in a single folder. You
can now save options like opacity, flow, 
blend modes, color, and size within
brush presets and convert all your

the old way, if you prefer.
Photoshop CC 2018 features new
brushes by designer Kyle T. Webster,
whose company, KyleBrush.com Adobe 
just purchased. Over
1,000 of Webster’s
custom designed
brushes are now
available for free via the

smoothing, which can
now be controlled more
granularly in the Options
Bar, removes the jaggies
from your brush, eraser, 
pencil, and mixer brush strokes. The
smoothing feature has several modes
and an optional tiny marker called a
leash tail so you can follow the brush 
path visually as you draw.
360 DEGREE EDITING FOR VR
The new Photoshop lets you open and
edit 360-degree equirectangular spherical 
panoramas that you can export for use
with VR and panoramic viewers. Editing 
360-degree panos works only in
Photoshop’s 3D workspace, but with it you
can accomplish most of the effects you are
accustomed to on your 2D images, which 
is quite impressive.
Once you import your 360-degree
pano, you can edit it by drawing, painting,
adding adjustments, removing objects,
hiding seams, or adding text. For non-
destructive layer based edits, you can

PEN TOOL LOVE
Photoshop’s Pen Tool isn’t going
anywhere, but if you’d rather have an
easier way to create paths, Adobe has
introduced a Curvature Pen tool. Like the
similar tool in Illustrator, it is designed to
easily create curved or straight paths, path 
segments, or shapes by clicking points
instead of adjusting Bezier curves. You can
then grab any point, adjust, or add points 
to better fit the selection.
The Curvature Pen tool is accompanied 
by another ease-of-use update to path
lines, which define your paths onscreen.
You can choose bright colors and adjust 
line thickness to make paths easier to see.
These path updates are optional features,
but ease the way for newcomers to work 
effectively with paths.
The Curvature
Pen tool arrives on
Photoshop, and not
a moment too soon.
Add and remove 
points at will.
Ever struggle to follow the path? No longer.
You can alter path thickness and color so

TECH PREVIEWS
Preserve Details 2.0 and Enable Paint
Symmetry, both tech previews you can
switch on optionally in the preferences, 
are powered by Adobe’s Sensei AI
framework. Preserve Details, on by
default, uses deep learning to more
accurately upscale photos without
sacrificing detail, preserving texture and
edge details, including hard edges and
text, or hair and skin tones, and even
food, that can appear soft or distorted 
with previous resampling techniques.
For most images, even upscaled to
300 percent, I did not notice a huge
improvement. You may start to see the 
effects a bit more by pushing
enlargements to 400 percent and beyond,
but overall, I found the improvement to be 
subtle for most of the shots I tried.
Photoshop now lets you paint
symmetrically while using the Brush,
Pencil, and Eraser tools, a feature whose 
ease and fluidity targets painters,

ASTROPAD STUDIO:
USE YOUR IPAD PRO
AS A DIGITIZER FOR 
YOUR MAC
BY JEFF CARLSON    
IMAGE: ASTRO HQ
As a longtime Adobe Photoshop and
Lightroom user, I periodically consider
buying a digitizer, such as a Wacom tablet,
to better take advantage of editing with
brushes and other tools that work with
pen-based input. I know photographers
and artists who swear by them, but it
would be a significant expense for my
comparatively modest editing needs.
It turns out, though, I already have an
excellent pen-based touchscreen device:
an iPad Pro with an Apple Pencil. More
often than not, it’s usually on my desk at 
home or in my bag at a coffee shop.

26 MACWORLD JANUARY 2018

REVIEW: ASTROPAD STUDIO
Astropad Studio (go.macworld.com/
asst; $79.99 per year) turns that iPad Pro 
into a digitizer. Most Wacom tablets
incorporate a pen-sensitive surface that
transmits strokes and taps over a wire. If
you want to spend at least $800, the
Wacom Cintiq (go.macworld.com/waci)
provides a touch-sensitive screen on
which to work. (Wacom tablets that don’t
incorporate a screen start at around $60.)
Astropad Studio does the same on
the iPad Pro you already own, wired or 
wirelessly. The company also sells
Astropad Standard (go.macworld.com/
stan), which works with non-Pro iPad
models and costs $29.99 as a one-
time purchase.
The Astropad Studio app runs on the
iPad Pro and communicates with a sister
application on the Mac. When connected—
via a Lightning-to-USB cable or with both 
devices on the same Wi-Fi network—the
iPad Pro displays a portion of the Mac’s
screen, which you can control using 
your fingers or an Apple Pencil.
How much you see depends on your 
screen resolution. When set to 100
percent view, the iOS app reveals only a 
section, necessitating some window
resizing. You can also view the entire
Mac screen on the iPad by holding
Astropad’s main button and tapping the
Fullscreen button, but that means you’re 
not working 1:1 with the app you’re
controlling, which may not be as
accurate when drawing. Switching
between views and repositioning the
active area is simple and quick, however.
It’s important to note that Astropad
Studio isn’t limited to specific applications, 
nor does it require plug-ins or other
hooks. The Pencil becomes your 
Astropad Studio
on the iPad Pro
and a resized
Lightroom Classic
to fit Astropad’s
visible area at 100
percent. Instead
of shrinking
the application
window, you could
focus Astropad
Studio on areas
and move the
view as needed.

JANUARY 2018 MACWORLD 27
All of those features are 
welcome, but the top
consideration with a setup
like this is performance. On a
10.5-inch iPad Pro, connected 
via USB to my late 2016
MacBook Pro with Touch
Bar, the app reported a 2
millisecond response time.
On my home Wi-Fi network,
running at 5GHz using an Eero 
system, that time was 4–5
milliseconds. In both situations
while I attempted some quick
sketching, there didn’t appear 
to be any noticeable lag.
Moving the active area
around does introduce a slight delay
while the screen re-renders; it displays a
low-resolution proxy for a second and
then the higher-resolution version kicks 
in. A setting to display a non-Retina
version of the screen solves this, as
long as you don’t mind a softer image 
(which mostly manifests itself in
software interface items and text).
BOTTOM LINE
Overall, Astropad Studio is an impressive
way to incorporate pen input into Mac
drawing or image editing. The $80 yearly 
subscription price feels steep for my
personal editing needs, but if you do this
kind of work more regularly, it’s justified. ■
mouse pointer, with the ability
to pass along Pencil-specific 
gesture data as needed.
If you’re using Astropad
Studio and the iPad Pro as a
digitizer, you’ll probably have
one hand poised over your
keyboard and the other using
the iPad. However, you can
also control everything from
the iPad using an onscreen
keyboard, shortcut keys
(Command, Option, Shift,
Control) that are easily
displayed, and quick access to 
basic commands such as
Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy, and
Paste. Those are the defaults; you can set 
up any menu item in that space.
Further customization is possible
through Magic Gestures, actions that
involve both finger touches and Pencil
drawing. Annoyed that you can’t flip the 
Apple Pencil over and erase? (Even
years out of school where I rarely touch
a real pencil, that’s a behavior that will
probably never go away.) Activate a
tool’s erase function by holding one
finger on the screen and drawing with
the Pencil. Or touch two fingers on the
screen and tap with the pencil to right-
click and bring up the contextual menu.
You can configure Magic Gestures for 
other actions, too.

iMOVIE 10: FREE
VIDEO EDITING
THAT’S ELEGANT 
AND EASY
BY SAMUEL AXON 
Apple’s iMovie has been around for a
long time, and it has always focused on
one philosophy: ease of use in a clean
and elegant interface. After many years,
this hasn’t changed. It’s still a delight to
use, if a little bit obtuse at times in its
pursuit of minimalism. It lacks some of
the formats and features supported in
other programs, but what’s there is 
implemented beautifully.
iMovie doesn’t offer the tutorials or
wizards that some other programs for
beginners do—though there is a neat
movie-trailer–generation tool. Rather, it
keeps the interface as basic as possible
while guiding you with simple tooltips as
you mouse over specific buttons and

is so popular that even casual
observers might start to notice
the same visuals popping up in
home movies again and again.
iMovie has another advantage 
over other Mac video-editing
software: performance. It’s very
well optimized on modern Macs, 
and works very quickly—
especially on a MacBook Pro. We 
had no problems importing,
editing, and scrubbing through a
4K video smoothly, where other
free editors buckled under the pressure 
on the same hardware.
And in general, playing nice with other 
Apple products is something iMovie is
quite good at. It will automatically bring in 
photos, videos, and audio clips from
iCloud. You can view your iMovie projects
on your Apple TV with minimal
fuss. And it interoperates with
a strong version of iMovie for 
iPhones.
iMovie is free to all new
Mac owners, and it’s a great
place to start if you want to
learn to edit videos, because
its basic workflow is similar to
that of more sophisticated
programs. It would be an
unequivocal slam-dunk if it just
supported a few more features 
around the edges. ■
features. Total beginners might end up
scratching their heads a little more than
they would in apps with more explicit 
tutorials, though.
The features are also somewhat
limited. There’s no 360 video, nor is there
multi-cam editing. iMovie doubles down on 
making a very small selection of 
tools like transitions,
backgrounds, titles, voiceover,
and basic trimming and editing
as straightforward as possible.
It’s quality over quantity here,
which is in stark contrast to
many other free applications.
Titles and transitions look
impressively professional, and
they can often be applied to
satisfaction in about three clicks
or less. Just be careful about
using the popular ones; iMovie

Got an iPhone X?
Do these 10 things first!
Before you even peel the plastic off your new iPhone X, read this setup guide.
BY JASON CROSS
iOSCENTRAL
The Latest on the iPhone, iPad, 
Apple Watch, and App Store
S
o that $1,000+ sticker shock 
didn’t put you off from buying 
the phone that Apple calls “the 
future,” did it? We don’t blame 
you—we bought the iPhone X, too. I 
know you want to dive right in the 
moment you get the box in your hands, 
but slow your roll! We have a little setup 
advice you’re going to want to pay 
attention to. Sure, it seems like a drag 
right now, but this stuff is going to 
save you time and frustration later.
1. BACK UP AND RESTORE
That’s right, you’ll want to back up your old 
iPhone after you have your new iPhone X in 
hand, so the backup is as up-to-date as 
possible. Back up via iCloud or iTunes:
IMAGE: APPLE

36 MACWORLD JANUARY 2018
iOSCENTRAL
iPHONE X SETUP GUIDE
For an iTunes backup: Connect your old
iPhone to your Mac, launch iTunes, select
your iPhone by clicking the little phone
icon in the toolbar, and under Backups, 
choose This Computer. Checking
Encrypt iPhone Backup is a good idea, so 
your account passwords and Health
data gets backed up too—just choose
a password you won’t forget. Click the 
button to Back Up Now.
When the backup is done, connect
your new iPhone X, then tell iTunes you
want to restore from the backup you just
made. Or, skip to step 2 and use Quick
Start. Later, you can switch back to iCloud
backups if you prefer, in Settings →iCloud 
→Backup. But it never hurts to run a
backup on your own Mac every now and 
then. 
For an iCloud backup: No need to connect 
your iPhone to your Mac. Just launch
Settings and tap on your Apple ID profile
listing at the top, then go to iCloud →iCloud
Backup and select Back Up Now. When 
setting up your
new iPhone X,
you can restore
your iPhone from
this backup once
you’ve logged in 
to your new
device with your 
Apple ID.
If you happen to be coming from an
Android phone (hey, welcome to the
garden!), there’s a Move from iOS Android 
app (go.macworld.com/ioaa) that can
assist you with setting up your Google
account data in Mail, Calendars, and
Contacts, moving your camera roll over, 
and even transferring your Chrome 
bookmarks to Safari.
2. UPDATE YOUR OLD iPHONE 
AND USE QUICK START
iOS 11 introduces a really great new feature
called Quick Start. It’s sort of like magic.
You just hold your new phone next to your
old phone, and a little card pops up asking
if you want to transfer all your stuff to the
new device. You’ll then point your old
phone’s camera at your new phone (which
displays a cloud of little dots) and enter 
your old phone’s 6-digit passcode.
You’ll go through the rest of the setup
process, like enabling Face ID, and then
your phone will be ready to go, set up just
like your old iPhone. It’ll even prompt you 

JANUARY 2018 MACWORLD 37
to update your old iPhone’s backup if it 
hasn’t been backed up in awhile.
Setting up your phone this way
transfers over most of your settings, the
arrangement of your Home screen, and
more. It’s a huge time-saver. But it requires
iOS 11, so if you haven’t updated your old
phone to iOS 11 (go.macworld.com/upda)
for some reason, you might want to do that 
ASAP. You don’t want to have to wait
through a big update process once you 
have your iPhone X in hand.
After setting up your phone this way,
you’ll want to give it a few minutes to
re-download all your apps. Initially, your
phone will show placeholders for your
apps, all arranged and stuffed into folders
exactly as on your old iPhone. But every
time you download an app from the App
Store, your phone actually grabs a unique 
version specifically optimized for that
iPhone model. So your new phone has to
download the apps again, but your user
data and settings get transferred over.
As fast and easy as this is, we still
recommend backing up your phone as
described in step 1. If anything goes really
wrong during your setup process, you’ll be 
glad you did!
3. SET UP FACE ID AND  
APPLE PAY
Yes, you should use Face ID for maximum
security—it’s the quickest way to unlock
your iPhone X, and will let you set a more
complicated passcode, since you don’t
have to type it in every time. Setting up
Face ID is much faster than Touch ID,
too—the setup screen will prompt you and
ask you to slowly look around in a circle a
couple times. It’s a lot quicker than tapping 
the Home button dozens of times to 
register a fingerprint.
Worried about your privacy with Face
ID? Don’t be. No photos of your face nor 
Quick Start makes setting up a new iPhone 
fast and easy.

any other biometric
data ever leave your 
phone—Apple
doesn’t get any of
that. And it isn’t
accessible by other
apps, just as other
apps weren’t able to 
access your
fingerprints with
Touch ID. You can
read all about it in
our Face ID FAQ (go.
macworld.com/faid).
Since you need
to have Face ID
enabled in order to
use Apple Pay, this would be a good time
to jump into Apple’s Wallet app to set that
up. If you’re new to Apple Pay, just follow 
the instructions within Wallet to add a
credit card or two. If you already had
Apple Pay on your old iPhone, you’ll notice
that your credit cards have disappeared 
on your new iPhone. Why? For your
security, of course. Your Wallet history will
still be there, but you’ll have to re-enter
any payment cards you’d like to use with
Apple Pay. (For more on Apple Pay, check
out our guide at go.macworld.com/appa.) 
4. UPDATE YOUR APPS
Great, now you should be on your Home
screen at last. Hit up the App Store first—
you’ll want the latest versions of all of your
apps in order to take advantage of all the
new abilities Apple has given developers
in iOS 11. If you’ve used Quick Setup, most
of your apps should be up to date already, 
so this will be, er, quick.
While you’re there, check out the App
Store’s new iOS 11 redesign (go.macworld.
com/rdsn). You’ll find collections of cool
apps curated in magazine-style articles, 
interviews with up and coming app
developers, game trailers, and more
goodies over in the Today section. This
changes daily, so you can come back 
tomorrow to see what else is new.
Don’t forget you can have your apps
auto-update by flipping the Updates switch

editorial app packages on the iPhone, too. 

JANUARY 2018 MACWORLD 39
in Settings →iTunes & App Stores. Or, you
can manually update your apps and just
check out the What’s New release notes 
to see what changed. 
5. PAIR YOUR APPLE WATCH
If you use an Apple Watch (or maybe you
just bought a brand-new Apple Watch
Series 3 [go.macworld.com/aw53] to go
with your future-phone) you’ll need to
pair it to your new iPhone to keep the
Activity data flowing to your Health
database, and keep your new phone’s
notifications flowing to your watch. First
you have to unpair your watch from your
old iPhone, either in the Apple Watch app
on your old iPhone (tap your watch, then 
the i icon, then Unpair Apple Watch,
then enter your iCloud password when 
prompted), or on the watch itself 
(Settings →General →Reset).
Then, launch the Apple Watch app on
your new iPhone X, which will walk you
through the pairing process, including
setting a passcode, unlocking behavior, 
and Apple Pay.
If your Apple Watch isn’t already
running watchOS 4, you’ll want to update
it. Read more about watchOS 4 here (go.
macworld.com/wos4). To upgrade, your
Apple Watch needs to be connected to its
charger, in range of your iPhone, and at
least 50 percent charged. Then look for
the Software Update option in the Apple 
Watch app. Upgrade your watch all the
way to watchOS 4.1 (go.macworld.com/
wo41), which adds awesome new music 
features for Series 3 watches and
important security updates for everyone.
6. LEARN THE NEW
GESTURES AND COMMANDS
As you may have noticed, your iPhone X
has no Home button. Where the Home
button used to be, you now have an extra
half-inch or so of glorious OLED display!
So how do you do all that stuff you
used to use the Home button for? How
does the app switching work? Or taking 
a screenshot?
Here are a few basic commands you’ll
need to relearn now that your iPhone is 
“home free.”
Return Home: Just swipe up from the 
bottom of the screen. Easy!
Jump between apps: Swipe left or
right along the bottom edge of the
phone to jump back and forth between
apps. You can sort of “flick” from the
bottom corners, moving your finger up
and over, to “bounce” between the apps,
or just slide directly side-to-side along 
the bottom edge.
App switcher: Swipe up from the
bottom edge and pause for a second with
your finger still on the display. App cards
will quickly pop up, and you can lift your
finger off and swipe around through them.

40 MACWORLD JANUARY 2018
iOSCENTRAL
iPHONE X SETUP GUIDE
Close an app: If you need to kill an app 
from the app switcher, you do it a little
differently. On other iPhones, you swipe up 
on the app card. On the iPhone X, you
press and hold on the cards until red
minus (–) symbols appear in the corners. 
Tap those to close the apps.
Take a screenshot: Simply press the
side button and the volume-up button at 
the same time.
There are a lot of other commands
and gestures to learn, and you’re in
luck because we have a guide for that at 
go.macworld.com/cmnd!
7. TRY OUT PORTRAIT 
LIGHTING
The iPhone 8 and X support a brand-new
camera technology called Portrait Lighting.
It’s in beta, but you can still give it a shot
(get it?). Just launch the Camera app and
select Portrait from your camera modes
at the bottom of the screen, and then
swipe through the different lighting 
options at the bottom.
On the iPhone 8, portrait mode
(including Portrait Lighting) is only
available on the back cameras. But on
the iPhone X, the front-facing selfie 
camera can use it, too!
The iPhone X has most of the same
camera improvements as the iPhone 8
Plus—better low-light performance, more
accurate color, and up to 4K 60fps video. 
But the iPhone X has optical image
stabilization (OIS) on both the regular 
and the telephoto rear cameras.
8. CUSTOMIZE YOUR  
CONTROL CENTER
Control Center is one of the biggest
changes in iOS 11. Instead of spreading 
Portrait Lighting will take your iPhone X
portrait shots to the next level. Hello Kitty 
agrees.

JANUARY 2018 MACWORLD 41
your utilities out over three sliding
pages, Apple condensed them into one 
screen with a uniform-looking set of
icons. On the iPhone X, you access
Control Center by swiping down from the
top of the screen, to the right of the
sensor notch. Apple’s default Control
Center utilities include your camera,
flashlight, calculator, and alarm clock;
you’ll also find two sliding controls for
your volume and screen brightness, plus
toggles for rotation screen lock, Do Not
Disturb, screen mirroring, and all of your
wireless controls (like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi,
and Airplane Mode). This is also where
you’ll find your iPhone X’s remaining 
battery life percentage, since it can’t fit
on the screen anymore (thanks, Face  
ID notch).
One of the best parts about iOS 10’s 
Control Center was the full page of
controls just for audio playback, like when
you’re listening to a podcast or streaming
from Apple Music. In iOS 11, your audio
controls are condensed into a small box
featuring just a play/pause button and
some skip controls. However, if you 3D
Touch on the audio control box, it will 
expand and reveal a full suite of 
options for better control.
In fact, several of your Control Center
utilities have hidden 3D Touch features—
iOS 11’s Control Center is customizable (the default configuration is at far right). Individual items 
can be expanded to reveal additional controls.

just long-press on any control to expand it.
A light tap will turn that feature on or off,
but a longer 3D Touch gesture will expand 
it some more.
There are a boatload of other features
you can add to your Control Center panel,
too—head on over to Settings →Control
Center →Customize Controls, and add any
feature that seems interesting. Looking for
something new? Check out Do Not Disturb
While Driving, a feature that automatically
enables Do Not Disturb once your iPhone
detects that you’re in a moving vehicle,
and Screen Recording, which lets you
record what’s on your iPhone’s screen 
and then share it.
For more on what Control Center
can do, check out our deep dive  
(go.macworld.com/hccw).  
9. CHARGE IT UP, QUICK!
There’s a reason your new iPhone X has 
that shiny glass back, and that’s not
because it’s a throwback to the iPhone
4. No, that glass back is for wireless
charging support. To use this feature, 
you’ll need a compatible wireless
charging pad that utilizes the Qi
standard (Apple sells two—one from
Belkin [go.macworld.com/blkn] and one
from Mophie [go.macworld.com/mphi]—
but we’ve tried others that work fine
too). If you have one of those, set
your iPhone onto the pad and watch it 
start to power up. Say goodbye to the
jumble of Lightning cables on your 
bedside table!
Of course, you can charge your
iPhone X via Lightning if you want to. In
fact, this is still the fastest way to charge
your phone, provided you use the right 
adapter and cable.
The iPhone 8 and X support fast
charging using the USB-C Power Delivery
(USB-PD) standard. You can use Apple’s
own 29W USB-C power adapter, or the
USB-C power adapter for a modern
MacBook Pro. But third-party USB-C
power adapters should work as well, as 
long as they support the USB-PD
standard. You’ll need to buy a lightning-
to-USB-C cable and a new adapter,
because you’ll only find that same old
slow 5W adapter and a USB-A lightning 
cable inside your iPhone X box.
10. SEND ANIMOJI
TO YOUR FRIENDS
I know it’s silly, but the best way to brag
about your new Future Phone is to send
someone an iMessage that shows the
Poo Emoji perfectly lip-synced and
following your facial expressions as you
sing “Bohemian Rhapsody.” They will be 
so jealous.
Animoji are found in Messages, as an

and eliminates the Home button. If Apple 
says the iPhone X is “the future,” the 
Home button is ancient history.
How do you even use an iPhone 
without a Home button? Here’s a quick 
guide to all the new gestures and button 
combinations you’ll need to relearn as 
you acquaint yourself with the iPhone X.
Return Home: Let’s start with that most 
basic of Home button features: returning 
to the Home screen. Just swipe up from 
the bottom of the screen. Easy!
Wake it up: You can still raise the 
phone to wake it like you can on other 
modern iPhones, or tap the side button. 
But the iPhone X also supports tap-to-
wake. Just tap the display to wake it up.
Jump between apps: Swipe left or 
right along the bottom edge of the 
phone to jump back and forth between 
apps. You can sort of “flick” from the 
bottom corners, moving your finger up 
and over, to “bounce” between the apps, 
or just slide directly side-to-side along 
the bottom edge.
App switcher: Want to see all your 
running apps? Swipe up from the bottom 
edge and pause for a second with your 
finger still on the display. App cards will 
quickly pop up, and you can lift your 
finger off and swipe around through 
them.
Close an app: You shouldn’t have to 
do this often, but if you need to kill an 
app from the app switcher, you do it a 
little different. On other iPhones, you 
swipe up on the app card. On the iPhone 
X, you press and hold on the cards until 
a red minus (–) symbol appears in the 
corners. Tap those to close the apps. It’s 
very similar to the way you delete apps 
from your Home screen.
Take a screenshot: Simply press the 
side button and the volume-up button at 
the same time.
Reachability: This isn’t enabled by 
default on the iPhone X. You’ll have to 
go into Settings to turn it on. Once you 
do, swipe down from the bottom edge of 
the screen—the little dark bar that 
indicates where the gesture area is. Your 
entire display will shift downward so you

can reach the top of your apps more 
easily.
Notifications: You still swipe down 
from the top of the screen, just as with 
other iPhones. But with the iPhone X, 
there are two “swipe from the top of the 
screen” gestures, so you gotta swipe 
from the left side of the sensor notch to 
get to your notifications.
Control Center: With the bottom of 
the screen consumed with other home 
gestures, the swipe for Control Center 
has moved to the top of the screen. Just 
swipe from the right side of the sensor 
notch. The right “horn,” if you will. The 
left side is Notifications.
Invoke Siri: Just press and hold the 
side button. Of course, you can still use 
your voice by saying, “Hey, Siri!”
Apple Pay: Tap the side button twice. 
You’ll have to authenticate the purchase 
with either Face ID or your passcode. 
You’ll notice that with Siri and Apple Pay, 
you just use the side button as you used 
to use the Home button, so it should be 
pretty familiar.
Power off and S.O.S.: To get the 
power-off slider and S.O.S. button, press 
and hold the side button and either 
volume button for a few seconds.
Force reset: Quickly tap the volume-
up button, then the volume-down button, 
then press and hold the side button.
Accessibility: If you’ve turned on the 
Accessibility Shortcut feature in Settings 
→ General → Accessibility, you invoke it 
by triple-pressing the side button. 
Generally, most of the gestures that 
have you swiping from the edge of the 
screen don’t require a lot of precision. 
As long as you’re somewhere in the 
general vicinity of the edge, they should 
work. Apple indicates the bottom 
“gesture area” with a horizontal bar. 
Some apps have their own screen-edge 
gestures (games, in particular, are 
known for this). If you’re using an app 
that has a screen-edge gesture the 
same as a general iPhone X command, 
just repeat it. The first swipe should 
perform the game’s command, but the 
second swipe should perform the iOS 
system command. ■

A
talking fox. A pig doing
stand-up. A singing pile of
poo. A robot reciting slam
poetry. You’re going to see
all these things and more all over your
iMessages and social media feeds in 
the coming months. They’re called
“Animoji” and they’re Apple’s frivolous,
fun, and downright addictive way to 
show off the capabilities of the
TrueDepth camera in the iPhone X  
(go.macworld.com/ip0x).
Animoji FAQ: Everything you need 
to know about Apple’s adorable 
animated emoji
Are you just dying to record Animoji Karaoke? We’ve got you covered.

If you want to know how they work
and what you can do with them, read
on. Once you learn a few tricks, they’re 
a lot more flexible and fun than just
sending an iMessage to your friend 
as a talking pig.
WHAT ARE ANIMOJI?
The word Animoji is a portmanteau of 
“animated” and “emoji,” and that’s
exactly what these are. It’s a feature
exclusive to the iPhone X that uses the
front-facing TrueDepth camera to scan
your face and make an emoji follow your
facial expressions and mouth position.
When you talk, or squint, or shake
your head, the Animoji will do the exact
same thing. It’s more fun than it sounds!
DO ANIMOJI USE MY  
FACE ID DATA?
No. No apps can use your Face ID data.
The operating system doesn’t even have 
access to it. It’s locked away in the
Secure Enclave on your iPhone (a
separate piece of silicon from the main 
processor), and is never
sent to Apple nor shared 
with any apps at all.
But developers do
have access to the
TrueDepth camera
through the ARKit
interface, which takes the 
regular front-facing camera input and
combines it with a course 3D mesh of
your face. Developers can’t use this info
to unlock your phone, or analyze it to
produce a set of data that could unlock
your phone. In practice, it’s no more 
dangerous than taking a selfie.
In other words, Animoji (and other
apps) use the same hardware as Face ID,
but Face ID is a different, totally separate 
set of data.
WHERE DO I FIND THEM?
Animoji are found in the iMessage app,
built right into iOS 11 on the iPhone X.
Just launch Messages, and then start a
new message or open a thread to reply
to someone. Look for the little monkey
face at the bottom (if you don’t see it, tap 
the grey App Store icon next to the
message line). Tap the monkey to get 
into Animoji.
Once you start up the iMessage app,
you’ll notice that the animated character
begins tracking your facial expressions
and mouth movement. Press the red

button to record, or scroll through the list 
on the left to change characters. Tap the 
up arrow to make the Animoji app 
window bigger, so you can more easily 
see all the available emoji.
WHICH EMOJIS ARE 
AVAILABLE AS ANIMOJI?
Apple hasn’t made every emoji into an 
animated 3D cartoon. Only a dozen (so 
far). They are:
Given the popularity of Animoji, I’m 
sure more characters will come.
HOW LONG CAN AN ANIMOJI 
RECORDING BE?
Animoji recordings are limited to just 10 
seconds. That’s enough for a quick 
message to your friend, but not nearly 
long enough to sing a song.
CAN I SWITCH ANIMOJI 
CHARACTERS AFTER I 
RECORD?
Yes! After you record, but before you 
send, just tap a different Animoji 
character and it will apply your recorded 
voice and expressions to that one.
WHAT ABOUT STICKERS. I 
LOVE iMESSAGE STICKERS!
Well lucky for you, you can use Animoji 
as still image stickers in the blink of an 
eye. Just bring up the Animoji interface, 
pick your character, make a face, and 
drag the Animoji up into the messaging 
window like you would any other 
sticker. BOOM. Smiling dog sticker.
HOW DO I SAVE MY ANIMOJI 
RECORDINGS?
Once you have sent an Animoji 
message, or if you receive one, tap on it 
to play it. You’ll notice a Share button in 
the lower left.

Tap the Share button. Then tap Save 
Video. Now it’s in your camera roll!
HOW DO I USE ANIMOJI IN 
OTHER APPS?
You’ll do the same thing as the above
step, only instead of pressing Save
Video, you’ll press the share icon of
whatever social media or other app you 
want to use.
If the app doesn’t have a share icon,
no problem—just Save Video, then open
up the app you want to use and deploy
your Animoji recording exactly as you 
would any other video.
HOW DO I MAKE ANIMOJI 
KARAOKE?
Animoji Karaoke (go.macworld.com/kara),
where people lip-sync to their favorite
tunes using Animoji and share them on
social networks, is a hot fad. But how
do you sing along to your favorite song 
if Animoji recordings can only be 10 
seconds long?
You go around the time limit using 
iOS 11’s built-in screen recording!
Step 1: Find a song and play it from 
a source other than your iPhone X.
Music playback stops when the Animoji
interface comes up, so you’ll need to
play it from another sound source, loud
enough for your iPhone’s microphone 
to clearly hear.
Step 2: Open up Messages and the 
Animoji interface. Pick your Animoji.
Step 3: Open Control Center (swipe
down from the upper-right edge of the
screen) and tap on the screen recording
button. You may want to press firmly to open
the 3D Touch interface for it, and make sure 
the Microphone Audio option is On.
Step 4: Close Control Center and
perform your lip-sync. Don’t bother 
To use Animoji as a sticker, make a face and 
then drag it up into your conversation.

here are a lot of new features
and changes rolled into the
iPhone X (go.macworld.com/
if0x). But after using the iPhone
X for a few days (go.macworld.com/days),
the one that I think will make the biggest
impact on the way we use our iPhones 
day-to-day is definitely Face ID (go.
macworld.com/fcid). It’s a huge feature
that takes advantage of groundwork 
Apple has been laying for some time in 
iOS, but in the end it will triumph.
Face ID changes the game by
separating the act of unlocking the
iPhone from physical interactions with
the phone’s screen or buttons. Put
together with the Raise to Wake feature
introduced with iOS 10, the natural act
of lifting the iPhone X and glancing at it
performs two tasks that used to require 
Why Face ID makes security on the 
iPhone X invisible

FACE ID MAKES SECURITY INVISIBLE
interaction: waking up the device and
unlocking it. When I pull the iPhone X
out of my pocket and look at it, it’s
already on and unlocked. I can decide 
what to do next.
This adds a new dimension to how I
can use the iPhone X. Previously, when I
looked at the lock screen of my iPhone, I
could see my notifications, or swipe to
access widgets or the camera controls.
But interacting with notification bubbles,
Siri, widgets, and the photo library (via 
the camera app) were necessarily
constrained by security concerns.
Tapping on a notification bubble or 
interacting with
widgets will often
require you to
unlock the phone
before continuing.
With Face ID, all 
those barriers
vanish. Notifications
open the relevant
apps automatically.
The camera shortcut
provides you with
access to your
entire photo library.
Siri has access to all
your data. And all
without having to
take any additional 
steps to 
authenticate, because the authentication
has already happened while you were 
seeing what was on the screen.
NO MORE BAD HABITS
I’ll be honest: The combination of the
Touch ID sensor with the iPhone’s
Home button led me to bad behavior.
My habit was always to lay my thumb 
on the sensor and then push the
button, a combination that invariably
led me to unlock the phone and send
it to the Home screen. The idea of
gently laying my thumb on the Home
button and then taking it off in order 

JANUARY 2018 MACWORLD 53
to browse notifications rarely, if ever, 
occurred to me.
This is not to say that I didn’t
frequently pick my phone up just to
check something on the lock screen. I’d
do that too, to check the time or see if 
something big appeared in my
notifications. But when I’d do this, I’d
keep my thumb entirely off the Home
button. Then if there was a notification I
wanted to tap on, I’d need to move my
thumb to authenticate before continuing.
Face ID eliminates all these issues.
When I pick up my phone, it’s on and 
unlocked. I can read notifications and
tap, or swipe up to return to the currently
active app. That’s why articles like this
one by Mark Spoonauer at Tom’s Guide
(go.macworld.com/tomg) miss the larger
point. Face ID may not be as fast as
Touch ID in the singular act of unlocking
the phone (though I’ve never really felt
that Face ID was slow at all), but Face ID
makes the act of unlocking the phone 
largely an afterthought.
Face ID takes a multi-step process and 
eliminates it entirely. When I take the
iPhone X out of my pocket, I’m not
preparing to move through a multi-step
unlocking process. Instead, I’m considering
what I want to do: glancing at the screen to
see if there are any notifications, or swiping
to widgets or the camera, or swiping up to 
go back to my most recent app. The 
unlocking step just disappears.
This happens in third-party apps, too.
Opening 1Password, or my home security
video app, or my banking app, no longer
requires a mode shift where I need to
move my thumb onto the Home button in
order to authenticate.
It’s not that moving my
thumb a few inches
was a huge imposi-
tion, so much as it
requires a break in
concentration to do a 
little bit of book-
keeping in order to get me where I
wanted to go. With Face ID, I just go
where I wanted to go all along, no 
readjustment required.
Touch ID is a feature that makes it
easier to unlock your phone; Face ID is a
feature that makes you forget you need
to unlock your phone. In fact, there’s
almost no point in trying to quantify how
fast Face ID is when compared to Touch
ID. How fast does it take to do nothing?
The answer, you’ll find, is no time at all. ■
Face ID takes a multi-step process and
eliminates it entirely. When I take the iPhone

JANUARY 2018 MACWORLD 55
Not that it didn’t want you to lust over 
the iPhone 7 or iPhone 6, but there’s
something different about the way Apple 
is hawking iPhone X. With iPhone 8,
Apple is selling a new phone: better
processor, better camera, new color.
With iPhone X, it’s selling an experience. 
From the YouTube first impression
videos to celebrity retweets and rolling
reviews, iPhone X is being presented
not as a device but a phenomenon.
Like a summer blockbuster, iPhone X
is the new thing that everyone’s talking
about. And if you’re not buying it, you
need to see it. And once you see it, 
you’ll want one.
FEATURES FIRST
In some ways, Apple is treating iPhone X 
more like Apple Watch than a phone. 
With its first wearable, Apple
wanted to sell it to customers
as a piece of jewelry rather
than a piece of technology. It 
was about fashion and
connection rather than battery 
life and speed, and that
mentality propelled Apple
Watch to become the best 
selling watch—not just
smartwatch, overall watch—in 
the world.
Of course, the iPhone is 
already the best selling 
smartphone on the planet, but iPhone X
represents a whole new animal. Much 
like the original iPhone, iPhone X
represents the next 10 years of Apple’s
mobile strategy, but this time around it’s
not just “a revolutionary mobile phone.”
iPhone X is a lifestyle device, the first
iPhone in years that needs to be seen.
So, Apple took a very different tack
with the lead-up to the iPhone X launch.
It encouraged lines at Apple stores. It
gave a small faction of YouTube stars
hands-on access before traditional
outlets. It gave most reviewers a 24-hour
window to organize their thoughts. And
in perhaps the most un-Apple move of
all time, it collected the most glowing
comments and put them out in a press 
release (go.macworld.com/prss).
Now, you could say Apple is

IPHONE X MARKETING STRATEGY
desperately trying to control the iPhone
X conversation with this strategy, and
maybe it is. Most of the reaction we’ve
seen has been after short stints with the
device, and problems are far more likely
to crop up after days rather than hours.
Plus, with a slow rollout it can avoid a
pile of issues like it experienced with
Apple Watch Series 3’s cellular issues.
But I’d argue the opposite, that Apple is
more confident in iPhone X than any
other product its released. Above all,
Apple wants to show that there isn’t a
steep learning curve with iPhone X, and
the shortened window for reviews helps 
illustrate that point, however subtly.
But Apple’s main motivation with all
these iPhone X first looks is to put a
focus on its fun features rather than
specs. That’s plain to see in the YouTube
videos that were heavy on entertainment
and light on examination. But even the
transitional outlets focused more on
Face ID and the new design rather than
battery benchmarks and speed tests.
Apple needs the core features of iPhone 
X—buttonless navigation, hands-free 
unlocking, and yes, the notch—to
become ingrained in its culture even
before most people are able to buy one. 
And even before iPhone X releases,
Apple is already laying the groundwork 
for it to take over.
With three flagship models this year, 
Apple doesn’t need to move large
numbers of iPhone Xs. Based on its first
quarter guidance, Apple plans to move a 
metric ton of iPhones over the next
couple months, and a lot of those sales
will be due to the appeal of iPhone X,
even if they end up buying an iPhone 8 
instead.
SHUT UP AND TAKE  
MY MONEY
The whole point of iPhone X is to
showcase the future of Apple’s
smartphone strategy. It’s not about
me-too features like the OLED screen, to
the edge-to-edge design.
It’s a sneak peak, albeit
one you can buy for $999.
For many buyers,
money won’t be an object.
The cost of a top-of-the-
line iPhone X on the
iPhone Upgrade Program versus a
top-of-the-line iPhone 8 Plus is $16 a
month, a premium for sure, but not
nearly as painful as the $400 up-front
cost. Based on the 5- to 6-week delay in

shipments on Apple.com, Apple has
already sold millions of its new iPhone X,
and there are millions and millions more 
in the pipeline.
But whether Apple sells more iPhone
Xs in the holiday quarter than iPhone 8s
isn’t the issue. It’s about impressions.
When iPhone X was first announced, the
reaction was somewhat muted. There
were concerns about Face ID. People
wondered if it was worth such a premium
over iPhone 8 Plus. Some even started
questioning whether Apple’s “all screen” 
claim was even accurate.
But that, too, plays right into Apple’s
marketing strategy. Apple knew there
would be questions about iPhone X. But
with one fell swoop of first impressions, 
Apple dispelled
all naysaying.
Face ID works.
The screen is
amazing. And it’s
worth the extra
money if you
can afford it.
Even if you
don’t buy an
iPhone X today,
tomorrow, or
next month,
Apple has
planted the seed 
of desire. It 
doesn’t matter if you watched
Booredatwork’s video (go.macworld.com/
batw), read Matthew Panzarino’s review
(go.macworld.com/mapa), or followed
Recode’s discontent (go.macworld.com/
recd). People who were already going to
buy an iPhone X really want one now.
But more importantly, a whole group of
people who normally might not care
about an iPhone launch weekend will go 
to the Apple Store anyway to get a
glimpse of the new iPhone. They’ll try it
out. They’ll tweet out pics. And they’ll
tell their friends that they need to go 
see it too.
And if they have $1,000 burning a
hole in their pocket, they’ll buy one 
whenever it’s available. ■

BY JASON CIPRIANI
Mophie made a name for itself with its
battery-pack cases for smartphones years
ago. As the company grew, so did its
product line. Portable batteries are a
natural extension of Mophies product
offering. We tested the Powerstation Plus
XL, a 12,000mAh (46.056Wh), lightweight
battery pack. The $99 pack includes a
cable that’s dual purpose, with a
removable Lightning adapter for Apple
devices and a Micro-USB adapter for
everything else. There’s also a standard
USB-A port on the pack.
The built-in cable tucks into the edge
of the pack, wrapping around roughly half
of its perimeter. Removing the Lightning
adapter to convert to Micro-USB is a
breeze. A single Micro-USB port on the
opposite end of the cable is used to
charge the pack itself.

REVIEW: MOPHIE POWERSTATION PLUS XL
A power button and four indicator
lights make it easy to quickly check on the
charge level of the pack, and see how far 
along it is when being charged itself.
Included in the box is the battery
pack and a short Micro-USB cable you
can use to charge another device via the 
standard USB port, or charge 
the battery pack.
Using our testing procedure,
we found the Powerstation Plus
XL to have an amazing 93.41
percent efficiency rating. This is
the highest rating we’ve seen on
any of the battery packs we’ve
tested. We were able to verify
the 5V/2.1A output with testing 
equipment.
You won’t find official
Qualcomm QuickCharge 2.0 or 
3.0 support, sadly.
The downside is that our testing
revealed a pack that doesn’t always
charge at its advertised 5V/1.8A rate.
Instead, the unit we tested charged at
5V/0.8A, taking a total of 12 hours to reach 
capacity. For a pack of this capacity, it
shouldn’t take that long to refill.
A secondary test showed the
pack charged at the advertised
rate, cutting charge time in half.
BOTTOM LINE
At $99, the Mophie Powerstation
Plus XL isn’t the least expensive 
battery pack we tested, and
slow charging of the pack itself 
is disappointing. But it’s the
most efficient pack we’ve 
ever tested. ■

GUARDZILLA 360: 
THIS SECURITY  
CAM MONITORS AN 
ENTIRE ROOM, BUT 
ITS UNPOLISHED 
APP SPOILS THE 
EXPERIENCE  
BY MICHAEL ANSALDO 
Home security cameras have a couple of 
ways of maximizing the amount of room 
real estate they can cover. Ultra-wide-
angle lenses are the most common 
solution, but they often cause distortion 
as they squeeze the image to fit. 
Cameras with motorized pan-and-tilt 
features let you sweep the room, but this 
leaves you turning your back on one part 
of a room to see what’s happening in 
another. The Guardzilla 360, as its name 
suggests, pulls off the neat trick of 
monitoring an entire room all at once.

REVIEW: GUARDZILLA 360
The Guardzilla 360 uses the same
pyramid design as the original Guardzilla 
All-In-One HD Security Camera (go.
macworld.com/all1), but this model is
equipped with 1712p HD camera on the 
top pointing up. It also includes
360-degree PIR (passive infrared) motion
sensors to detect movement from any
angle, along with night vision, two-way
talk, and an ear-splitting 100dB siren that 
can be set to go off when motion is
detected. Three programmable call
buttons on the body of the 360 allow 
people in the house to send push
notifications to users’ smartphones.
When the Guardzilla 360 detects
motion, it records an eight-second video
clip of the triggering event. These clips are 
saved for free for up to two days in
Guardzilla’s Video Cloud Storage, from
where they can be downloaded to your
phone. You can upgrade to a seven-day
storage plan for $5 per month or $50 a
year, or a 30-day plan for $9 per month or
$90 a year. Both subscriptions also extend 
video recordings to 30 seconds each.
The Guardzilla 360’s camera points up from the top of the body to give you a panoramic view of 
the entire room.

Guardzilla also offers its own

companion app, which walks you through 
the steps of connecting to your Wi-Fi
network. The process takes only a few
steps and I didn’t encounter any issues.
Because of the unique nature of the 
360, placing it requires a little more
thought than standard fixed-angle
cameras. Ideally, you want an unobscured 
view from all angles, which eliminates
mantles, bookshelves and the other spots
where you’d typically park a camera. For
testing purposes only, I settled on the
dining room table. This also solved
another potential issue—because the
camera is on top pointing upward, you 
risk cutting off the view of a lower
portion of the room if you place it too high.
The Guardzilla app livestream displays
a panoramic view of the room that you
can view by either panning with your
finger on your device’s screen, or by
leveraging your phone’s accelerometer
and moving the phone left or right. Both
work, but panning was smoother with 
the latter method.
When viewing a static view of the
room, however, the image shakes slightly 
from side to side. This was more 
pronounced when I panned with my finger,
shaking more violently between swipes. I
eventually determined this is a byproduct 
of the accelerometer involvement,
because it would stop when I set the
phone down on a table. It might sound like 
a minor annoyance, but it can be a
significant hindrance when you’re trying to 
focus in on a certain area of the room.
The 360 worked well in other regards.
Motion detection was accurate—thanks
largely to its use of PIR sensors to detect
warm bodies and ignore movement by
non-corporeal objects—notifications were
timely, and the auto-arm feature, which
activates/deactivates the camera based
on your proximity to home, operated 
as intended.
The Guardzilla app was more
problematic. I used the iOS version, and
while the dated design can be overlooked,
other quirks are harder to ignore. While
some camera features—like the livestream,
arming and disarming, and event history—
are visible and clearly labeled on the
home screen, others are obscurely nested 
in the settings menu. The controls for
adjusting the sensitivity of the motion and
audio sensors, for example—a feature you
usually fiddle with over time—are buried in
the Other Settings submenu of the general
settings menu, along with set-and-forget
features like your time zone and account 
info. Ditto for night vision.

REVIEW: GUARDZILLA 360
It’s also not clear what some features
do. A settings icon on the live-stream
screen opens a mini control panel with 
two prominent buttons labeled
Show POV and Set POV. It’s not
at all clear from context
what these buttons do. It turns
out they let you set a starting
point from which the camera will
start panning.
In my case, it hardly mattered
because the buttons didn’t work. 
Neither did the one that’s
supposed to let you take a
screenshot of the live stream. And
the app crashed a lot, sometimes
when I tried to change screens

and other times for no discernible reason at 
all. Guardzilla warned that there were
“infrequent” app crashes on certain phones, 
and to just relaunch the app if you
encountered them, but that solution wasn’t 
effective for me.
The 360 works with Nest, Samsung
SmartThings, and IFTTT, as well as with
Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice
commands. I used it with an Echo Show to 
arm the camera by saying “Alexa, tell
Guardzilla I’m leaving.” This requires you
to set up a PIN that you’re prompted to
enter each time you ask Alexa to arm or 
disarm the camera.
BOTTOM LINE
The first thing to consider is whether you
really need a 360-degree view of the room
you want to monitor. Most security camera
users really only want to keep an
eye on small areas of their home—
points of entry like front porches
and back doors or the rooms
where their pet is corralled or their
baby sleeps. For uses like this, a
fixed-angle camera will suffice. If
you decide you really want or
need whole-room coverage, the 
360 will give you complete
coverage, but be aware you’ll
likely have to contend with its
subpar app until Guardzilla can 
work out the kinks. ■

iPHONE X REVIEW
T
his is it—the iPhone that
longtime Apple users have
been waiting for. The iPhone X
(go.macworld.com/phox) brings
back the thrill of the original iPhone, which
was introduced 10 years ago. It breathes
new life into the product line with an eye
toward the future, while providing plenty 
of functionality for today.
What makes the iPhone X exciting?
First, there’s the TrueDepth camera, used
for Face ID (Apple’s new security feature),
as well as augmented reality. Then there’s 
the OLED display, which is so good-
looking, you may make the iPhone X your 
primary device to look at pictures and
watch video. And last but not least, there’s
the A11 Bionic processor, which brings the 
iPhone to a new level of performance.
The iPhone X also has a bunch of other 
great features: new cameras, a bigger
screen in a smaller form factor, and a new
beautiful physical design. In all, the iPhone
X is a remarkable achievement by Apple—
and at $999 (64GB) and $1,149 (256GB),
one that you’ll pay a pretty penny for.
Let’s go over the main features of the
iPhone X. I’ve ordered them according to 
what I think buyers will want to know 
about most. 
FACE ID
The iPhone X feature that’s gotten the
most attention is Face ID (go.macworld.
com/face), Apple’s technology for
unlocking the iPhone X and authenticating 
your ID. It replaces Touch ID, Apple’s
fingerprint technology that served the
same purpose. I’m not going to dive into
the details on how it works in this review,
as we have a Face ID FAQ (go.macworld.
com/ffaq) that covers that information.
Setting up Face ID is easy. In a process 
similar to Touch ID, where the Home
button records several impressions of your 
fingerprints, the Face ID setup has you
move your head in different angles as the 
TrueDepth camera system records
different spots on your face. It takes a few

minutes, and then it’s ready to go.
Face ID only allows a single person to 
register his or her face. Touch ID,
conversely, allows you to register different
fingers, which means you can register the
fingerprints of other people who you want 
to have access to your device. This is 
handy if you’re OK with, say, your
significant other having access to your 
iPhone. Maybe Face ID’s one-face
limitation will change if Apple decides to
use Face ID on the iPad, a device that’s 
more likely to have multiple users.
I had some concerns about Face ID
because Touch ID has become seamlessly
integrated into how I use my iPhone. But
as it turns out, there was nothing to be
concerned about. In fact, Face ID delivers
more seamless integration than Touch ID.
When it works, Face ID works really
well. At first, I had a tendency to wait for
the lock icon on the screen to unlock, but
the key is to not wait. You should swipe up 
to get to the Home screen as you’re
looking at the iPhone X. It takes some
practice, but before too long, unlocking 
the phone feels effortless.
I’ve had conversations with Android
users who’ve tried the iPhone X, and their
main beef with Face ID is that it’s too slow
compared to a fingerprint scanner. But in
their limited time with the iPhone X, they’re 
not accessing the Home screen in the
manner I described above—and since
they’re not invested in the iPhone, they’re
not willing to learn, either. It’s still true that
access to the Home screen using Face ID
isn’t as fast as using a fingerprint scanner, 
but it’s maybe a half-second slower at 
most. If that half-second is all the
difference to you, then I hope you’re 
using that time wisely.
Using Face ID with some third-party
apps is done in a manner similar to that of
Touch ID. For example, with the app for my
bank and with Dropbox, the login screen 
By default, Face ID requires your eyes to
be open in order for it to work, but if you
go into Settings →Face ID & Passcode and
turn off the Require Attention For Face ID
setting, Face ID will work when you have 
your eyes closed.

iPHONE X REVIEW
appears, and then a Face ID icon appears, 
and then the app unlocks. It’s really no 
different than how Touch ID was
implemented in those two apps, thus, it’s 
no more convenient.
Face ID has a certain viewing angle
you need to be within to work, which is
where I have a very minor issue with the
technology. I try to keep my personal
correspondence on my iPhone when I’m
using my work laptop, and the iPhone X
lays on my desk to the side. When I get a 
text, I can see it on the iPhone’s lock
screen. On the iPhone 6s Plus, I use Touch
ID to unlock my iPhone while it’s still at my
side. But with the iPhone X, my face is out
of range of the TrueDepth Camera. The
solution to this minor issue: Move the
iPhone X in a new location so it’s within
range of my face. I have also found that
Face ID works when the iPhone X is in my
car mount, which is attached to an air vent 
to the right of the steering wheel.
Apple is very confident in Face ID’s
security, stating that it’s much more secure
than Touch ID. Many other publications
have tried to see if they can trick Face ID,
with their results matching what Apple has
said: that twins can bypass Face ID. Since I 
don’t have access to twins, I didn’t test
this, but Face ID wasn’t fooled when I tried
to have my two sons access the iPhone X.
A recent Wired story (go.macworld.com/
brke) says that hackers have been able to 
crack Face ID by creating a mask, which
essentially means that a nefarious person 
needs to pull off some Mission:
Impossible–type antics. Likelihood of this 
happening to you? I’d say almost nil.
Apple has said a lot about how it
believes augmented reality is going to be
a big deal, and we’ve seen AR apps, like 
Ikea (go.macworld.com/ikee), The
Machines (go.macworld.com/mach), and
AR MeasureKit (go.macworld.com/armk).
There are even rumors of Apple working
on an AR wearable (go.macworld.com/

big role in AR, and Apple
demonstrated how it can be
used with its recent release
of Clips 2.0 (go.macworld.
com/clip). Clips uses the
TrueDepth camera so it can
filter out background objects
for its Selfie Scene feature,
and the app can use you in
the foreground for a virtual
scene. Other than some
issues with clipping your
foreground image, the Selfie
Scene implementation
works quite well. Expect to
see a lot of fun and innovative apps that
use the TrueDepth camera coming soon in 
the App Store.
THE SCREEN, THE NOTCH, 
AND HEAD GAMES
The other feature that demands your
attention is the iPhone X’s screen. It’s the
first iPhone with an organic light-emitting
diode (OLED) display. It’s also the biggest 
iPhone display, measuring 5.8 inches 
diagonal.
I can’t emphasize enough how much I
love the iPhone X’s screen. I can say it’s 
gorgeous, but that feels like an
understatement. The colors are rich and
pop, text looks clean and sharp, and the 
black is so deep that I actually find it
mesmerizing. I’ve seen lots of screens that 
don’t look black—more like a 98 percent
gray—and as stupid as it sounds, I like to
gaze at the black gap on the second page 
of my Home screen. This is the best 
screen I’ve seen on an iPhone.
OLEDs are currently susceptible to
burn-in, the effect where you can see a
shadow of an image when something
else is on screen. This was evident in
Google’s Pixel 2 phone, which also uses
an OLED. Apple has even stated in a
knowledgebase article that burn-in on the
iPhone X’s display is “expected behavior”
and that the company has done what it
can to minimize burn-in. I haven’t noticed it
in the nearly two weeks since I’ve had the
iPhone X, but it is something I’ll keep an 
eye on and will update this review
accordingly should anything change.
With black wallpaper (included in the iPhone X), you barely 
notice the notch.

iPHONE X REVIEW
When first using
the iPhone X, I had
to get over the false
impression that the
iPhone X’s screen is
smaller than what I’m 
used to on the
iPhone 6s Plus.
Based on diagonal
measurement (the
standard used for 
screens, TVs,
computer displays,
etc.), the iPhone X is
bigger (5.8 inches)
than the iPhone 6s
Plus (5.5 inches, the
same as the iPhone 7s Plus and the
iPhone 8 Plus). The iPhone X’s screen is
slightly narrower, though, and noticeably 
taller. Overall, it’s a bigger screen.
But it’s not the screen that gave me
the impression that the iPhone X’s is 
smaller. It’s the bezel on the Plus
iPhones. The black border on the Plus
iPhones, even though they aren’t part of
the screen, unconsciously became part
of the screen in my head. It took me a
few days to clear this psychological
hurdle (or optical illusion, if you will).
While showing the iPhone X to other
people, some of them also were fooled
into thinking that the iPhone X’s screen 
is smaller, so I think this could be a 
phenomenon experienced by many new 
iPhone X owners.
What didn’t take me long to get over
was the notch. Yes, the notorious notch, 
the one that houses the TrueDepth
camera system. I found it a distraction at
first, but it was yet another head game I
played on myself—what really bugged me
wasn’t the actual notch, but that I feel like
the notch goes against Apple’s design
aesthetic. But I was able to realize that in
typical use, I don’t notice the notch at all.
Even with full-screen videos, the notch
doesn’t bother me. (There is an option to
resize videos so as to avoid the notch,
but that means video is smaller than 
full-screen.)
The notch does get in the way when watching a full-screen video. In
this video, a person is obscured by the notch. You have the option of 
resizing the video so that the picture avoids the notch.

GESTURES AND THE 
LEARNING CURVE
Apple had to come up with a new set of
gestures to make up for the lack of a
Home button on the iPhone X. I learned
these new gestures quickly—you use them 
a lot, so if you need “practice” for the
muscle memory to kick it, you’ll get it.
We have a complete list of the new
gestures (on page 43) you’ll need to
learn. Most of them are simple, like swipe
up from the bottom to get to the Home
screen, or swipe down from the top of the 
display’s right side to get to Control 
Center.
Speaking of the Control Center swipe,
it’s the one new gesture I don’t like—you 
really need to reach to the top of the
screen area next to the notch, and this
requires more effort than the previous 
Control Center gesture (swipe up from the
bottom of the screen, which works on the 
iPhone 8 and older iPhones).
The iPhone X’s lock screen has two 
quick access buttons—one for the
flashlight, and another for the camera.
They’re easy to get to at the bottom of the
screen, but simply tapping each button
doesn’t activate it. You need to do a hard
press, like you do for 3D Touch. A hard
press is necessary, because you don’t
want these buttons activating while in your
pocket, and these lock screen functions
don’t require Face ID verification to work. 
But there’s nothing in the included
documentation that tells you how to use 
these buttons.
People’s tolerances for interface
changes varies, and I can see how
someone would absolutely hate not
having a Home button.
If you’re one of those 
people, then the
iPhone X is not for you.
But keep in mind, the 
Home button is
probably not in the
iPhone’s long-term
plans. It could be five
or six years before we
see Apple completely
abandon the Home
button, but it will
happen eventually.
To use the Flashlight or Camera from the lock screen, you perform 
a hard press on each button, similar to a 3D Touch.

THE CAMERAS

12-megapixels dual lens 
camera with a ƒ/1.8
wide-angle aperture,
ƒ/2.4 telephoto aperture,
optical zoom, 10x digital
zoom, and optical image 
stabilization on both 
lenses.
The pictures from the
iPhone X are excellent,
with vibrant colors and
great sharpness. The
iPhone X seems better at
handling a wide array of 
lighting situations
compared to other
iPhones I’ve used in the
past. As someone who
has no skill at adjusting
camera settings and
prefers to rely on
automatic settings, the
iPhone X produces
results that make me 
very happy.
The camera feature
that I really want is the 
optical image
stabilization on both lenses. My lack of a
steady hand (or my heavy-handedness
with pushing the shutter) often results in 
jitter that creates blur, and I found that with
the iPhone X, I had more good pictures 
than blurry, unacceptable ones.

The iPhone X comes with the new
Portrait Lighting mode, a special camera
mode that applies different lighting effects
to portraits. (On the iPhone X, this feature 
is available on both the front and rear
cameras.) The results you’ll get with
Portrait Lighting are mixed. I found that the 
Natural Light setting worked the best,
producing even results and nice bokeh.
Contour Light and Studio Light seemed to
create hot spots depending on the angle
of the subject, but emphasized different
detail elements to change the emotion of 
a picture.
Two of the
Portrait Lighting
modes, Stage Light
and Stage Light
Mono, are just…
well, I’ll say that I’m
not going to use
them. The pictures
I took using these
settings—as well
as a vast majority
of the pictures I’ve
seen from other
people—look
cheesy, and they’d 
be used as
examples of bad
image editing.
Apple decided to 
label Portrait
Lighting mode as beta, seemingly as an
excuse for the mixed results, so let’s hope
we see improvements in the near future.
The rear camera is capable of shooting
4K video at 24 frames per second, 30 fps, 
or 60 fps. Shooting 4K video at 60 fps
feels overindulgent, and if you have only
64GB of storage, it’s probably a setting
you will seldom use. But gosh, it looks so
buttery smooth and the detail is amazing. If
you have a 4K TV and love shooting your
own videos, 4K at 60 fps is the reason why
you need to get 256GB of storage. If you
don’t want to shoot any kind of 4K video, 
Portrait Lighting mode on the iPhone X can be hit or miss.

you’ll be happy with the 1080p and 720p

My favorite new feature of the video
camera is the Super Slo-mo mode, which 
captures video at 240 fps at 1080p
resolution. It’s another space-hogging 
camera mode, but it’s oh-so-fun.
Speaking of fun, I have to mention the
new Animoji, since they’re exclusive to the 
iPhone X (for now). Animoji uses the
TrueDepth camera to sync your head and
facial movements to an animated emoji.

PERFORMANCE
AND BENCHMARKS
The iPhone X sports Apple’s new A11
Bionic processor, a 64-bit six-core beast. It
has a pair of performance cores that Apple 
says are 25 percent faster than its
predecessor, the A10 Fusion. And Apple
says the A11 Bionic’s four efficiency cores 
are 70 percent faster. We used the
Geekbench 4 (go.macworld.com/gkb4)
app ($1) to get an idea of the speed of the 
A11 Bionic in the iPhone X.
Obviously, the A11 Bionic is faster than
the A10 Fusion, but what’s of note here—
and not surprising—is that the iPhone X

Overall, the iPhone X feels like a
snappy phone when launching apps,
unlocking the phone, playing videos
(streaming and stored on the iPhone), and 
other tasks. When I tried
doing simple video edits
in iMovie, or when I
created a short video in 
Clips, the iPhone X
rolled along smoothly,
though the higher the
resolution of the video,
the more performance was hit—but never 
to a point where I was left frustrated.
BATTERY LIFE
Apple states the following statistics for 
battery life:
> Up to 21 hours talk time
> Up to 12 hours Internet use
> Up to 13 hours wireless video 
playback
> Up to 60 hours wireless audio 
playback
No one performs only a single task on
their phone. When was the last time you
spent a day using your iPhone just for 
phone calls? What’s important is whether
or not you can get through a day on a
single battery charge, using your phone
for different tasks. And the more power
you have left on your phone at the end of 
the day, the better.
The day I decided to keep a close eye
on battery life was a particularly busy day
for the iPhone X. I used the phone for
email, texts, and a phone call of five
minutes. I looked up a recipe on the 
Internet, tracked my fantasy football team 
throughout the day, and got driving
directions for a 30-minute trip through
downtown San Francisco. I shot 129
photos and 9 short videos, and uploaded
them via Wi-Fi to my Dropbox account. I
watched a couple of streaming YouTube
videos (one over Wi-Fi, the other over LTE)
for a total of about 30 minutes. And at the
end of the day, I took my dog for a walk for 
over an hour and played Pokémon Go 
(which is a battery killer).
After all that, the iPhone X’s battery
life was at 52 percent—before I went on

was at 71 percent. Typically, I’m not this
busy with my phone, so I can get through
a working day without worrying about
charging the iPhone X. Of course, your 
mileage may vary.
MOSTLY GLASS DESIGN
With the 2017 iPhones, Apple decided to go
back to a glass front and back. The main
reason for this is so that the phone can
support wireless charging. The iPhone X
works with wireless chargers that adhere to 
the Qi standard (go.macworld.com/qist).
I don’t have a wireless charger to work
with the iPhone X, and frankly, I think
wireless charging is overrated. Sure, it’s
convenient; just place the iPhone X on
the charging pad (if it’s in a non-metal
case, you can keep it on), and that’s it, the 
pad does all the work
and charges the phone.
Of course, you have to 
place the iPhone X
properly; if it’s slightly
off to the side, it won’t
charge. To me, it’s not
that much of an effort
to plug a Lightning
cable into the iPhone X.
And you have to pay
extra for a wireless
charger, whereas the
iPhone X comes with a
5-watt adapter and a 
Lightning cable. Finally, there’s no speed
advantage (as of yet) to using a wireless
charger. But hey, just because it’s not
something I’m interested in doesn’t mean 
it’s not right for you. I just don’t see
wireless charging as something you need
to think about when deciding if you want 
to buy an iPhone X or not.
The glass construction feels nice in the 
hand, and on the silver iPhone X that I
have, the silver steel frame between the
two pieces of glass sparkles and dazzles—
it looks so good that it’s a shame that I
keep my iPhone X in a case. (Glass, even
as strong as the glass on the iPhone, still
isn’t as strong as metal and can shatter 
after a fall.)
The back of the iPhone X, like other
iPhones, is still saddled with a camera

bump. As I mentioned earlier, I often use
my iPhone by my side when I’m on my
work computer, and the phone can’t lay
flat on its back, rocking in a teeter-totter 
motion when I tap on the screen.
Fortunately, the case I use provides
enough thickness to compensate for the
camera bump and let the iPhone X lie flat.
But it sure would be nice if the bump went
away, either by advancements in camera 
technology, or by making the iPhone
thicker (maybe add more battery?).
BOTTOM LINE
2017 marks the tenth anniversary
of the iPhone. What I remember
most about the first iPhone was
my sense of astonishment. Sure,
it had its flaws, but I felt like I was
holding the future of computing 
in the palm of my hand.
However, with each new 
generation of iPhones
introduced, I started to feel less
and less like the iPhone was a
harbinger. The new features felt
more like incremental steps that 
helped solve a current problem rather than
giant leaps that made you wonder what
incomprehensible thing will be unleashed.
That’s not to say that those iPhones were
bad products; on the contrary, they were 
great. But they weren’t inspirational.
And now we have the iPhone X, and
that sense of astonishment and inspiration
is back, for me. That’s mostly because of
the TrueDepth camera and the A11 Bionic—
AR development could really take off, and
it’s going to be fun to see what comes of it. 
Other features, like the
spectacular quality of the OLED
screen, the bigger screen in a 
smaller footprint, and the
cameras, complete the package. 
All of this comes at a big
price—the iPhone X is the most
expensive phone Apple has ever
made. Is it worth it? If you simply
want a great tool for the job, you’ll
probably be fine with the iPhone 8
(go.macworld.com/ifo8). But if you
are a true iPhone fan, or you like
the idea that the future is in your
hand, you need the iPhone X. ■

POWER ADAPTERS
IS FAST CHARGING
WORTH THE PRICE?
TESTED
We tested charging speeds on the iPhone X, 8 Plus, and 7 Plus with ﬁve
different power adapters. The results may surprise you. BY JASON CROSS

N
ew to this years’ iPhones is
fast-charging capability. Accord-
ing to Apple (go.macworld.com/
ata), you can juice up your
phone to 50 percent in just 30 minutes!
There’s just one catch: You have to buy a
new power adapter. Oh, and a new USB-C
to Lightning cable, too. That’s two catches, 
and it’s starting to sound expensive.
Is it even worth it? We grabbed five
power adapters and three iPhones, ran a
bunch of tests, and got to the bottom of the
iPhone charging mystery. The truth is, while
USB-C fast charging certainly works, you’re
much better off buying Apple’s 12W USB-A
Power Adapter (go.macworld.com/pwa)—
the one that comes with most iPads. It’s a
lot less expensive ($19) and nearly as fast.
HOW WE TESTED
The iPhone X, 8, and 8 Plus all support fast
charging from USB-C power adapters that 
support the new USB Power Delivery
(USB-PD) specification. It’s the same way the
new MacBooks get charged over USB-C.
But we wanted to see how well that
stands up to using the adapter that comes
with your phone, and the 12W adapter that
Apple includes with iPads. What’s more,
we wanted to see how these new phones
stack up against older iPhones that do not 
officially support USB-PD fast charging.
We tested three phones: iPhone X (go.
macworld.com/ix), iPhone 8 Plus (go.
macworld.com/i8p), and iPhone 7 Plus (go.
macworld.com/i7p).
The iPhone 8 Plus and X have essentially 
the same size battery. The former is 2691
mAh and the latter 2716 mAh—that’s about a 1 
percent difference, so we’ll just call those
2700 mAh. The iPhone 7 Plus has a slightly
larger batter at 2900 mAh. That’s less than 8
percent larger, but it is enough of a difference
that, even if the iPhone 7 Plus were to draw
just as much power as the other phones, it
would take just a little bit longer to charge up.
For each of these phones, we drained
them to 1 percent remaining battery life,
then made sure no apps were running and
the phone was in airplane mode to prevent
any background activity like app updates or
photo syncing. We then charged them up
with each of our five test adapters, making
note of the charge level every five minutes.
The five adapters tested, along with
their price and maximum output wattage, 
are as follows:

To be sure, Apple’s 29W USB-C Power
Adapter (go.macworld.com/29pa) is proba-
bly overkill, able to supply more power than
the phones will accept. And that’s certainly
true of the 61W USB-C Power Adapter (go.
macworld.com/61pa) for the 13-inch Mac-
Book Pro. But we wanted to see how well
the new iPhones use the USB-PD spec to
negotiate power delivery speeds to get the 
most out of higher-wattage adapters.
That’s the point behind testing the 18W 
USB-C Power Adapter for the Google
Pixel. It operates using the USB-PD spec,
and delivers plenty of power for a phone 
at 18 watts. It should, in theory, be just as 
fast as Apple’s USB-C adapters.
You can, of course, buy less expensive
USB-C adapters than Apple’s. Any USB-C
adapter that supports USB Power Delivery
should work just fine. Here’s one for $25
(go.macworld.com/25a, we haven’t tested 
it). But no matter what USB-C power
adapter you use, you’re going to need a
USB-C Lightning cable. Apple sells those
for a whopping $25 for a 1-meter cable 
(go.macworld.com/1m), or $35 for a
2-meter cable (go.macworld.com/2m). That 
sound you hear is your wallet crying.

CHARGING RATES BY PHONE
Let’s take a closer look at how each phone
performs when charged up with each of 
these five power adapters.
The iPhone 7
Plus, which has no
official support for 
USB-C fast
charging, delivers
some interesting
results. With the
included 5W
adapter, the phone
takes almost 3.5
hours to fully
charge. The 12W
charger and all of
the Apple USB-C
chargers deliver 
nearly identical
performance,
charging the
phone to 85
percent in about
an hour and 20
minutes. That’s an
hour faster than
the in-box charger.
The Pixel adapter
is considerably
faster than the
included charger,
but slower than
Apple’s 12W iPad
adapter or any of its other USB-C adapt-
ers. Weird!
The iPhone 8 Plus charges at the same
speed as the 7 Plus when using the 12W

iPad adapter. But the USB-C adapters,
including the Pixel’s, all perform the same
and are a bit faster. It’s clear that the newer
phone is negotiating proper speeds with the
USB-C chargers via the USB-PD standard,
and that they all deliver as much power as
the phone can handle. But the big news
here is that the 12W Apple adapter, which
requires no new and expensive cable, gets 
most of the way there. The USB-C chargers 
are maybe 20 to 25 percent faster.
The iPhone X story is essentially
identical to the iPhone 8 Plus. The USB-C
chargers get you just over 50 percent in
half an hour, and fully charge the phone in 
just under two hours. The 12W Apple
adapter is only about 20 minutes behind.
It looks like the new phones definitely

show benefit from
USB-C chargers,
but even older
phones like the
iPhone 7 Plus can 
use them and
charge much faster 
than with the
included 5-watt
adapter. Still, given
the high costs of
the adapter and the
USB-C Lightning
cable you need to
buy to use it, the
$19 12W Apple adapter (go.macworld.
com/12w) looks like a real deal. It’s much
faster than the 5W adapter, works with all
iPhones, and doesn’t require a new cable.
CHARGING RATES  
BY ADAPTER
And you can see in the charts above, no
matter which phone or power adapter is
used, the charging
rates become very
slow after about 85 
to 90 percent.
Once the phones
reach that point,
they climb very
slowly up to 100
percent. This is
perfectly normal
behavior for all
phones. A lithium
ion battery should
only be charged at
a certain rate once

it nears capacity, both for safety and to
help preserve the longevity of the battery. 
Therefore, to make the differences
between the various power adapters a little 
clearer, these next
graphs will show
the charging rate 
only up to 85
percent. After that,
every adapter is so
slow that the differ-
ences between
them are essentially
meaningless, and
simply showing how
long it takes to get
from empty to 100
percent obscures
some of the real 
speed differences
between the differ-
ent chargers.
The 5W adapter
included with each
iPhone is just pain-
fully slow. No matter
which phone you
have, it charges at
roughly 0.6 percent
per minute. It takes
about 2 hours 15
minutes to get up to 
85 percent.
With Apple’s $19
12W power adapter, charging speeds sky-
rocket on all three phones. They’re quite
similar—all within about 5 minutes of each
other. It takes about 1 hour 20 minutes (give

or take a few minutes) to charge up to 85
percent, regardless of iPhone model. That’s
about 70 percent faster than the included 5W
charger, and you don’t even need to buy a 
new Lightning cable!
Apple’s cheapest USB-C adapter costs
$49 (go.macworld.com/cac) and requires
you to buy a $25 USB-C Lightning cable
(go.macworld.com/lcai). What benefit do
you get? With the iPhone 7 Plus, none at
all. It’s exactly as fast as the 12W adapter. If
you have an iPhone 8 Plus or iPhone X,
you’ll get to 85 percent about 10 to 15
minutes faster. The newer phones defi-
nitely see improvement with USB-PD 
compatible adapters, but it seems to taper 
off after about 70 percent charged.
Apple’s claim of charging to 50 percent
in 30 minutes with the iPhone 8 and X is
absolutely true with a USB-C adapter that 
supports USB-PD. It takes 10 minutes
longer to get to 50 percent with the 12W
adapter, or with the older iPhone 7 Plus.
The MacBook Pro power adapter uses 
the USB Power Delivery standard, and
sure enough, it performs exactly as the
29W adapter does. The differences are
well within the margin of error. This is
unsurprising: none of these phones can
draw 29 watts, let alone 61 watts, so any 
29W USB-C ADAPTER: CHARGING RATES

properly negotiated charging speed will 
be maxed out on both of them.
Google’s 18W USB-C Power Adapter for
its Pixel phones costs $35 (though you can
sometimes find it for less), and comes with
a USB-C cable. So while you’ll still need a
USB-C to Lightning Cable ($25 for 1 meter,
$35 for 2 meters), at least you’ll get and
extra USB-C cable out of the deal. The
maximum power output is 18 watts and that
seems enough to charge the iPhone 8 Plus
and X at their maximum speeds, just like 
Apple’s USB-C adapters.
But the iPhone 7 Plus results are interest-
ing. While Apple’s USB-C adapters charge
this older iPhone at the same speed as the
12W USB-A adapter, Google’s USB-C adapter
(despite also adhering to the USB-PD stan-
dard) is slower. It’s a lot faster than the 5W
adapter included with the phone, but not 
quite as fast as the 12W adapter. 
THE BEST iPHONE POWER 
ADAPTER TO BUY
Whether you have one of the latest iPhones
or a somewhat older model, it’s worth your 
while to buy the $19 Apple 12W 
USB Power Adapter (go.
macworld.com/pada). It uses
the same USB-A Lightning
cable that came with your
phone and it provides a huge
charging speed benefit for
new and old phones. It’s 
about 70% faster than the included 5W
adapter. Buying a USB-C charger and USB-C 
Lightning cable will cost a lot more (the
cable alone costs more than the 12W
adapter!) and is roughly 20% faster than the 
12W adapter.
That’s a lot of money for a 15-minute
advantage. The only real point to diving
into USB-C on your new iPhone would
be if you can use the USB-C adapter on
other products as well—if you have a
new MacBook, for instance. When Apple 
releases new iPads in 2018, they will
undoubtedly support USB-PD and bene-
fit from your investment in USB-C Light-
ning cables.
The real crime here is the horrible
charging performance Apple gives you out
of the box. Apple simply charges too much
money for its phones to get away with a
piddly 5-watt USB-A charger. At $800 for
the iPhone 8 Plus and a whopping $1,000 
for the iPhone X, the company should
absolutely include a decent USB-C char-
ger and cable. It doesn’t have to be the
29W charger they currently sell separately,
but something in the 15-18W range 
would let you charge your
phone as fast as it can go. 
What’s more, Apple
charges too much for it’s
USB-C adapters and accesso-
ries, but at least you can buy 
third-party alternatives. ■

W
hen Apple comes to mind,

images of slick, carefully 
engineered devices with 
innovative, envelope-pushing features. 
And the company’s surely had more than 
its fair share of those, but it’s also 
managed to pull off a subtler but far 
greater feat that goes underappreciated. 
The company has not only figured 
out how to make us eat our vegetables—
technologically speaking—but it’s 
also turned those very features into 
selling points. Because it’s one thing 
to sell a flashy, shiny device; it’s quite

TURNING CHORES INTO EXCITING TECH
BABY GOT BACKUPS
In fall 2007, I’d only recently started
working at Macworld, and I was assigned
to cover what was the biggest of big deals
in those days: the launch of Apple’s latest 
version of Mac OS X, code-named
Leopard. As these were still the days
where you had to get yourself a physical
disc to install a new OS (and pay $129 for
the privilege!), I hauled myself down to my 
local Apple Store in the Cambrideside
Galleria (go.macworld.com/leop). What I
found was a decent length line of people
all queued up to get their copies of the 
new operating system.
I talked to a few folks in the line and
what surprised me was how many were
eager to try out one particular new feature
of Leopard: Time Machine. This was, after 
all, a feature that let you back up your
computer to an external hard drive—
nothing new in what it was doing, but a
significant change in that it was now
included as part of the core operating
system. (It probably didn’t hurt that it had a
whizzy interface compounded with Apple’s 
trademark simplicity.)
But the idea of people being excited
about backing up their data was mind-
boggling. This was historically a chore, the
kind of thing that people knew they should
do for their own benefit, but just ended up
putting off—like flossing or cleaning the
house. From Apple’s perspective, it was a 
feature to draw more people to the
platform and perhaps even to lock them
into the platform by committing their data 
to its own backup scheme. But it also
made life easier for the company itself: for
example, insuring that customers could
easily back up their data before bringing
their Macs in for service, or even forestall
customer support questions related to
data loss. Since users no longer had to go 
and buy expensive backup software
separately, it removed a major excuse for 
not backing up.
And, indeed, Time Machine paved the
way for iOS’s iCloud Backup feature. Now
it’s probably the rare person who doesn’t 
back up their Macs and iOS devices,
though Apple could still stand to increase
the default iCloud space and provide a
similar cloud backup service for Macs
(go.macworld.com/s4rv). Thanks to Time 

JANUARY 2018 MACWORLD 99
Machine and its successors, backing up
has become a habit rather than a chore.
SECURITY TOUCHDOWN
In the earliest days of personal computing,
security wasn’t necessarily something that
most people spent a lot of time thinking
about. Mostly because it wasn’t until much 
later that we started storing our most
important information digitally or connecting
our computers to networks that opened us 
to new threats. But it got even more
challenging when we started carrying our 
data-laden devices around with us.
Even in those earliest days, I don’t think
most people bothered to put passcodes
on their iPhones. Especially when the
device was new, users didn’t want to be
slowed down by having to punch in a 
four-digit code (so onerous!). As
smartphones became increasing targets
for theft and people started using more
and more apps to access sensitive or
personal data, passcodes became de
rigueur—only the industry default of four-
digit passcodes, which ATMs had long
accustomed us to, were quickly deemed 
to be not secure enough.
So, what to do? You want to encourage
people to use longer passcodes, but you 
want to balance that security with the
convenience of not having to thumb-type
a lengthy string of letters and numbers
every time you want to access even the 
most basic feature on your phone.
Touch ID was the major selling point
of the iPhone 5s, just as Face ID has been
for the iPhone X, and once again Apple
got us to all think about improving our
digital hygiene practices. Because once 
you set up Touch ID or Face ID, you
could have a lengthy secure passcode
and not have to worry about entering it all 
the time. Of course, neither biometric 
security option provides perfect
protection—as we’ve seen, people will
always try to come up with ways to trick
them—but if it encourages people to
use longer, more secure passcodes,
then Apple’s still managed to pull off
that impressive feat of getting us to do
something we know is good for us, 
even when we don’t want to. ■
Thus Touch ID was born.

BY GLENN FLEISHMAN
A
pple’s cloud services (iTunes,
iCloud, etc.) require you to
create an Apple ID, which is
essentially your key to access.
Each person using Apple’s services should
have a unique Apple ID, but sometimes
people share IDs for convenience. That 
could led to some issues, however.
For example, if an Apple ID is being 
shared by a couple, it can create a 
problem if the couple breaks up. A reader 
writes in with such a story:
My partner and I broke up. We shared
the same iTunes account. Everything
downloaded on one phone appears on 
the other. How do I stop this?
While the question is about iTunes, an
iTunes account is a form of Apple ID: you

BREAKING UP A SHARED APPLE ID
can use it just for purchasing, or with
iCloud for calendar, contacts, email,
photos, and music, as well as macOS
access and elements associated with
Continuity (iOS/macOS interactions).
Before I offer the rest of my advice, can 
you negotiate with this former partner
over custody? If so, you might be faced
with different choices. If you’ve purchased 
apps, music, videos, audiobooks, and
other items using this Apple ID, you
might have to figure out how one party
reimburses the other for stuff they want to 
keep and still use.
If that’s the case, one person could be
left with the account and simply change
the password. (This is a good time to
also enable two-factor authentication
[go.macworld.com/e2fa] and review the
phone numbers and email addresses
associated with the Apple ID, to make
sure they’re all yours; or encourage your 
ex to do the same.)
Let’s assume you are willing to
abandon the account or have granted 
custody to your partner.
First, you’ll want to copy all media and
other items that aren’t purchases that are
tied to the account. If you’re using the
Apple ID just for iTunes, that’s everything.
With apps and videos, usage is tied to an
Apple ID login, and you can use them
without logging in. (The music files have
no protection on them, but if both you and 
your partner retain copies, that’s a 
copyright violation.)
If you’re also using iCloud sync for
contacts, calendars, email, photos, or
music, you’ll want to make sure you have
the copies you want of all your stuff stored
locally before deleting it. The last stage of
what you’ll do after the below bullet points
is log out of the iTunes or iCloud account 
you’re using.
(I’m assuming no one will do something
malicious here and delete media or other
information that the other person has a
right to have, but given the complicated
nature of relationships, I’m going to let you 
all work out those details.)
Contacts: You can use the Contacts
app in macOS to select contact entries
and then use File →Export →Contacts
Archive to create a file that you can import 
on another Mac. You can then delete
those selected Contacts before logging 
out. Quit after deleting, because
otherwise, deletion can be undone.
There’s no way to export contacts from
iOS’s Contacts app or from iCloud.com.
However, you can use third-party apps that
access your iOS address book to group, 
copy, excerpt, and delete entries.
Calendar: If you’ve shared a single
calendar, it’s harder to separate these
entries and, as with Contacts, you have to
use macOS (or possibly a third-party iOS
app) to export entries. You may want to 

JANUARY 2018 MACWORLD 105
use Calendar in macOS to export an
entire calendar, and then selectively
delete entries related to you, especially
those with phone numbers, addresses, 
and people’s names.
Email: If you’re using options to store
email on a server with Apple’s Mail app,
retrieve it on a Mac to store locally by
dragging messages or mailboxes to entry 
under On My Mac that appear in the
sidebar. All messages you drag to that
section are moved from the server to your
Mac. You don’t need to do anything else. If 
you’re using a different email program, 
consult the directions for moving
messages and mailboxes from server 
storage to local Mac storage.
Photos: With iCloud Photo Library
enabled, every photo you upload using a
Mac, iOS device, or via iCloud.com while
logged into that Apple ID will be copied to
all other devices logged into the same one
(and available via iCloud.com). Copy the
files you want to retain, and then delete
them from Photos in iOS or macOS or via
iCloud.com. Deleting images from iCloud
Photo Library deletes them from every
device on which they appear. To make
sure they’re permanently gone, check for
the Recently Deleted album. If they’re still
there, select them and choose delete, 
which removes them forever.
Music: Apple lets you sync music files 
in your library across devices. (This is 
distinct from iTunes Match, which finds
high-quality versions of any music you’ve 
ripped or purchased elsewhere, and
makes those available.) You’ll want to
make sure to copy any music files that
belong to you before logging out of 
the Apple ID account.
After having done all of the above, on
all your devices, log out from that account.
If you’re using a single Apple ID for both
iTunes and purchases and for iCloud, log 
out from both places.
> In macOS, go to the iCloud system
preference pane, click Sign Out, and 
follow prompts.
> In iOS, to sign out of iCloud, go to
Settings, tap your name, and swipe down.
Then, tap Sign Out. For iTunes, tap iTunes
& App Store and then tap the Apple ID:
email@domain.com link. Finally, tap Sign 
Out.
> If you’re using third-party contact,
calendar, or email software, you may also
need to sign out of or delete your Apple ID 
from those locations.
Assuming you don’t have another
Apple ID you’re already using with iCloud,
create a new Apple ID at appleid.apple.
com (go.macworld.com/apid), then log in 
via Settings in iOS and the Sharing 
preference pane in macOS.
You can now copy all the stuff you
exported and saved back into your 
various apps. ■

Everything You Need to Know About iOS,

W
hen the HomePod (go.
macworld.com/h0p0) was 
announced at WWDC in 
June, it seemed like Apple 
was finally jumping head first into the smart 
speaker race. Introduced as a coveted 
“one last thing,” Tim Cook and Phil Schiller 
extolled the devices music playback 
abilities, saying the HomePod was going 
to “reinvent the way we enjoy music in the 
home” in a device that combined the 
fidelity of Sonos with the fun of an 
Amazon Echo.  
Like many others, I wanted to believe 
that pristine music quality was just one of 
many features Apple was bringing to the 
smart speaker space. But as more details 
begin to trickle out about Apple’s plans for 
the HomePod, it’s becoming clear that the 
new device is more of a voice-controlled

HOMEPOD LOOKING LIKE IPOD HI-FI
It lasted about a year-and-a-half before 
it was discontinued, and it stands as a
testament to the height of Apple’s hubris.
At a time when iPod sales were thriving, 
Apple poured its resources into an
overpriced niche product that seemed to
compete with accessory makers. In fact, in 
a statement made upon its retirement,
Apple stated, “There are over 4,000
accessories in the iPod ecosystem and
hundreds of speakers systems designed
specifically for the iPod, which provide
customers with a wide variety of options.”
And 12 years later, it seems like Apple
is readying to release the iPod Hi-Fi 2.0.
Even if the HomePod can rival Sonos
when it comes to sound quality, Apple
seems to be missing the boat entirely 
speaker than a true Echo 
competitor. While the
HomePod will work with
HomeKit to control smart home 
devices and respond to
general knowledge queries, it
doesn’t appear as though it will
break any ground that Google 
Home and Amazon Echo
haven’t already broken.
When Apple unveiled the
HomePod, it was a unique
device. No smart speaker on
the market had combined
high-fidelity sound with AI
smarts, and even with a $349
price tag, it seemed like a viable
competitor to the $99 Echo and $129
Google Home for people who cared about
sound quality. But the longer we wait for it, 
the more it seems it’s going to be the 
second coming of the iPod Hi-Fi.
That’s not the kind of speaker I want.
HELLO AGAIN, HI-FI
For those who don’t remember, the iPod
Hi-Fi (go.macworld.com/hifi) was a $349
in-room speaker made for Apple’s then-
growing line of iPod music players. It was a
top-notch speaker but it had a multitude of
issues, chief among them the precarious
placement of the iPod itself, which was
held in place by nothing more than a 
30-pin cable.
Apple iPod Hi-Fi.

JANUARY 2018 MACWORLD 109
when it comes to what people want in a
smart speaker. An early release of SiriKit 
for HomePod in the iOS 11.2 beta (go.
macworld.com/112b) suggests that the
HomePod will only be able to use Siri for
messaging, lists, and notes, and a nearby
iPhone or iPad will be required to work. It’s 
kind of like the original watchOS app:
Developers won’t actually be writing apps 
that run on the HomePod, they’ll be
tweaking their existing iPhone apps to 
communicate with the HomePod.
That’s a far cry from an Echo. Amazon’s 
device does all the processing on the
device itself, and with a vast library of
skills, there isn’t much it can’t do. Same,
too, with Google Home. From what we
know so far, it seems like the HomePod’s
chief skill will be the ability to play songs
through Apple Music, which is fine, but
people are going to expect it to be an
Apple version of an Echo, and that might
not be the case. If simple things like daily
briefings and ride hailing aren’t available at
or near launch, Apple’s first smart speaker 
is going to look pretty dumb.
SOUNDING OFF
The HomePod’s focus on sound might
have been somewhat novel six months
ago, but now that Google and Sonos have
their own versions of the high-fidelity smart
speaker in Max and One, respectively, the
HomePod is going to need to have more 
going for it than good sound. Even the
new Echo (go.macworld.com/ech0) has 
a better speaker now.
But Apple seems to have gone all-in on 
sound with the HomePod. A revealing
report in Bloomberg (go.macworld.com/
bbrg) recently laid bare Apple’s struggles
to bring the HomePod to market, detailing
the product’s years of development as an
audiophile side project that grew into a
smart speaker. Apple even considered
selling the product under the Beats
umbrella, according to the report.
That says a lot about where Apple sees
the HomePod fitting into the market. Where 
AirPods could get away with limited Siri
functionality, the HomePod needs to not just
be an audible extension of Siri on iOS, but
an enhancement as well. With the HomePod, 
you should be able to forget about your
iPhone when you enter your home, nor
worry whether it’s within communication
range. It should do more than your iPhone,
not less. And you shouldn’t have to think 
about what it can and can’t do.
That’s the beauty of the smart speaker: 
You can interact with it as if it were a
person. Questions are answered as they
are asked, and there’s nothing else to
think about it. If the HomePod doesn’t offer
the same experience, it’s basically just a 
really good speaker.
And as we learned with the iPod Hi-Fi, 
that probably won’t be enough. ■

A
irPlay has been with us for a
long time. It’s an evolution of
the old AirTunes protocol,
which was meant only for
music. In 2010, AirTunes got a host of new
capabilities (music, photos, video) and a
new name. A year later, it gained the ability 
to mirror your iOS or Mac screen to a
compatible AirPlay receiver. With an Apple
TV, you could put your Mac desktop on 
your PC in the blink of an eye!
You’ve seen the AirPlay logo in dozens
of apps, often tucked away in the Share
menu. If you want to beam content from
your iOS device to the Apple TV or a set 
of speakers, it’s delightful. But it has
languished over the last several years,
adding no meaningful new features while
the rest of the wireless world moved on.
With iOS 11, Apple introduces AirPlay 2. 
AirPlay 2 FAQ: What it is, how it
works, and which devices support it  
This major update to Apple’s wireless streaming protocol focuses on multi-room audio.

This is the first real update to the AirPlay
protocol in a long time, and it seems tailor
made to suit Apple’s ambitions to spread
media throughout your home with the 
Apple TV 4K and the HomePod.
WHAT’S NEW IN AIRPLAY 2?
AirPlay 2 focuses on new audio features
for the AirPlay protocol, and for the most
part ignores the screen casting and video 
playback parts.
It adds the following key features:
Multi-room playback: Apps can send
audio to several different devices around 
the home, with playback synced 
between them.
Enhanced buffering: AirPlay 2
compatible speakers will do a better job
buffering audio to avoid skips and drops.
Multi-device control: When audio is
streaming to AirPlay 2 devices, it can be
controlled via multiple different Apple 
devices. So you can start playing content
on your iPhone, and then later pick up 
your iPad and control playback.
WHAT DEVICES
SUPPORT AIRPLAY 2?
As far as Apple devices go, AirPlay 2 will
work on the iPhone 5s or newer, the iPad
Mini 2 or newer, the Apple TV (4th gen and 
4K), and any MacBook made in the last 
seven years or so.
You’ll also need speakers that
support AirPlay 2. Apple’s upcoming
HomePod (go.macworld.com/hp0d) does,
as will the speakers connected to your
AppleTV. Third-party brands will need to
release new products or, in some cases,
update firmware to support AirPlay 2.
Some brands that have announced 
support include:
> Bang & Olufsen
> Beats
> Bluesound
> Bose
> Bowers & Wilkins
> Definitive Technology 
> Denon
> Devialet
> Dynaudio
> Libratone
> Marantz
> McIntosh
> Naim
> Polk
AirPlay 2 adds multi-room audio and better 
buffering.

AIRPLAY 2 FAQ
Sonos fans can rejoice too, as the
company has announced AirPlay 2 support 
starting in 2018, both on new products
and in updates to existing products.
Sonos has never supported AirPlay
before, so that’s a big turnaround.
HOW DO I GET IT?
You’ll need more than just AirPlay 2
compatible gear. AirPlay 2 needs to be
supported by the OS and apps, too. It was 
announced as part of iOS 11, but didn’t
make the cut when iOS 11 was first released
in September. AirPlay 2 support will come in 
an update to macOS, tvOS, and iOS—
possibly 11.2 for iOS and tvOS (go.macworld.
com/iotv) and 10.13.2 for macOS.
It also needs support from app
developers. You can count on Apple’s
apps to be updated immediately, but if you 
prefer to play music around the house 
with Spotify (go.macworld.com/spot) or
Audible (go.macworld.com/audi) you’ll 
need to wait for an app update.
Given the benefits and the relatively
low complexity of adding support, it seems 
most major apps will probably update 
quickly.
WHAT ELSE DO I NEED TO 
KNOW?
If you’re going to beam music all around
the house, you’ll need to know which
speakers are where, right? AirPlay 2
integrated with HomeKit, so that speakers
can attach themselves to different rooms.
This means you can use them in
HomeKit’s Scenes to play audio in 
addition to adjusting the lights.
When Apple announced AirPlay 2, it
showed off a feature of Apple Music called
Shared Up Next. One iOS user can play
back music, but
other users in 
the same
location can all
contribute to the
Up Next song
list. This feature
will probably
show up in
Apple Music
when AirPlay 2
and the Home-
Pod ship. ■
AirPlay 2 requires new devices support or firmware upgrades.

before releasing its first Bluetooth
headphones, the sublime P5 Wireless  
(go.macworld.com/p5wi).
After testing the PX Wireless for a
week, I can say the resulting hardware 
was mostly worth the wait.
HOW ARE THE B&W PX 
DESIGNED?
Available in gray to match an iOS device
or a satin-finished gold and blue to match 
your Victorian-era British Admiralty
uniform, the PX maintains Bower & Wilkins’
unmistakable industrial design, but breaks
with the company’s traditional steel and
plush leather good looks for a lux modern 
vibe. The leather’s still
there, though—the
inside of the PX’s
headband and its
over-the-ear cuffs are 
finished with
luxuriously soft
padding and leather
that’d be at home in a 
Lexus or Lincoln.
As with their P5
Wireless and P7 
Wireless (go.
macworld.com/p7wi)
headphones, the PX’s
controls are found on
the back of the right
ear cup. The buttons 
are easy to get to and can be used to turn
the headphones on/off or pair them with a 
new device, adjust the volume, play or
pause your music, accept calls, and turn
the PX’s active noise cancellation on or off.
Additionally, sensors in the ear cups make
it possible to pause what you’re listening
to by simply removing the headphones
from your ears. Slip them back on and
your audio will start again. I found this
feature reliable while wearing glasses, a
winter toque, or with nothing more than 
my bare skin up against the cups.
The functionality of the headphones 
can also be tweaked via a free app
available via Google Play or the iTunes

App Store. For the time being, the options
available in-app are limited to a few simple
tricks: users can adjust the level of noise
cancellation, the sensitivity of the ear cup
play/pause sensors, change the name of
their headphones, or reset them to their
original factory settings. It’s possible to use
the headphones without the app installed
on your smartphone, but you shouldn’t:
Bowers & Wilkins plans to use the app to 
push out firmware updates and new 
software features to the PX.
As these are Bluetooth headphones,
you should know that the PX delivers up to 
22 hours of listening time with ANC
engaged, 29 hours without ANC, 33 hours
of use with ANC over a wired connection,
and 50 hours of ANC-free listening when 
tethered to your
music device with a
wire. I found these
battery times to be
roughly accurate.
HOW DO THE
B&W PX SOUND?
The PX support the
aptX codec and boast
40mm drivers that are
very similar to those
found in Bowers &
Wilkins’ bank-account-
busting P9 Signatures
(go.macworld.com/
p9sg). These drivers are angled to fire
music directly into your ear canals, while 
at the same time, providing plenty of
space for air to get pushed around. The
headphones offer a frequency range of
10Hz to 20kHz and a passive-impedance
of 22 ohms. B&W’s spec sheet for the
cans states that the PX provide less than
0.3-percent audio distortion at 1kHz/10W
and have a sensitivity of 111dB/V at 1kHz.
In addition to this, B&W baked a chip into
the PX that upsamples any audio played 
through them to 768kHz. In plain
English, all of this means that the PX are 
designed to sound very, very good.
Over the week that I tested the PX, I
found that the headphones produced
deep, warm bass with punchy mid- and

classical music, folk,

lean toward a less
forward-sounding
audio, you might be 
happier with
something like the
Bose QC 35 (go.

all day—and I have been.
Mark Ronson’s “Feel Right” (from
Uptown Special) rattled my head with its
bass line and the warm, round thump of
the kick drum, without trampling over the
track’s horn section. The grind of the guitar
in Bee MC’s “Meat Shaking” (Cash is King) 
felt as sweet and painful as if I were
standing in the same room with the band. 
While listening to The Gloaming’s
16-minute long “Opening Set” (The
Gloaming), the PX’s soundstage offered 
enough separation that I picked a
harmonium droning away in the
background—I’ve listened to that track for 
years without noticing that detail.
On the downside, I detected a bit of 
low-frequency hiss invading the audio
when activating the PX’s noise cancellation
at any level. It’s most noticeable at lower
volume and becomes unnoticeable at
50-percent volume and above. I don’t feel
this minor degradation to the PX’s audio 
quality will bother any but the most
stringent audiophiles. Phone calls taken on 
the PX sounded solid, too. With the
headphone’s noise cancellation on, calls
were rendered comprehensible, even in 
loud environments.
Since we’ve opened a can of worms 
on the topic, let’s talk about it.
DO THE B&W PX PROVIDE
GOOD NOISE CANCELLATION?
As I mentioned earlier, the Bowers &

owners to adjust their headphone’s noise-
cancellation level: Flight mode blocks out 
the maximum amount of noise, City

situational awareness, and Office,
according to B&W, will block out
background noise but allow you to listen 
to your coworkers blather on in the
immediate area (does anyone actually
want that?). Bose’s QuietComfort 30
(go.macworld.com/b030) offer similar
scalable noise cancellation. Personally,
I’ve never wanted less noise cancellation—
on or off suits me just fine.
When switched to their maximum
noise-cancellation setting and listening
to tunes at 50-percent volume, I was 
unable to hear all but the most
immediate noises, such as the
suggestion of a conversation
taking place directly next to
me. Testing them against the
noise made by a house full of
kids hopped up on Halloween 
candy, the drone of public
transit, and the chaos of a
bustling mall food court, I
found that the PX’s noise-

ear cuffs were more than up

music.

DO THE B&W PX HAVE  
ANY FLAWS?
Aside from the step-down in audio quality
that engaging the PX’s noise cancellation
causes, there’s not much to complain about. 
You should know that the first set of
headphones that Bowers & Wilkins sent out
to me had to be sent back: they refused to 
stay powered on for more than a few
minutes at a time. The new set I was issued,
however, have worked flawlessly. I’m not
thrilled by the fact that, despite coming with
a cable for plugging into a 3.5mm port, the
PX can’t be used passively. Once you’ve
drained the batteries, you’re hosed. I was
also disappointed to discover that while the
PX charge via a USB C connection, the USB
C port in the headphone’s cup can’t be used
to channel audio. And then there’s the price:
At $400, the PX cost roughly $50 more than 
competing headphones like
the Bose QuietComfort 35 or 
Sony’s WH-1000XM2 (go.

Answering Your Questions and Sharing Your 
Tips About Getting the Most From Your Mac
Why photo counts might differ 
between Photos in iOS, 
macOS, and iCloud.com
Computers are supposed to be good at 
counting, right? So why do the numbers 
sometimes not add up for photos? 
Macworld reader Jeffrey asks a question 
that’s similar to ones asked by others:
The photo count between my Mac and 
my iPhone are not the same. I use 
iTunes syncing along with My Photo 
Stream to keep the devices identical. 
Something has gone amiss. I don’t 
have any idea how to troubleshoot the 
image counts since iTunes is supposed 
to be syncing the images. How might 
I determine if a problem really exists, 
and if so, how do I fix it? 
There are long-running discussions 
on Apple’s forums about iTunes syncing 
not matching up numbers in iPhoto and 
Photos for macOS and iOS devices. These 
seem to stem from deleted photos where 
corresponding thumbnails remain in the 

JANUARY 2018 MACWORLD 119
library databases. If that’s the case, you
can rebuild an iPhoto library with these
instructions (go.macworld.com/rbld) and
repair a Photos library by following these 
directions (go.macworld.com/drct).
However, I’ve noticed even with iCloud
Photo Library, which I use, there can be
discrepancies. Let’s look at my library in
Photos for iOS, Photos for macOS, and 
iCloud.com:
> Photos for iOS reports 34,928
photos, 653 videos, and 1 “item”—35,582 
total.
> Photos for macOS
reports 54,808 photos
and 2,503 videos (57,311),
but “21,729 items on This
Mac Only” for a net of 
35,582.
> And iCloud.com
reports 35,583 photos 
and videos as a single 
number.
You can see it’s mostly 
consistent, although
confusing. Why is there
one more item at iCloud.
com than in iOS and
macOS? What is “1 item”?
(Apple offers no insight on 
that.)
The most explicable
thing, however, is the “on 
This Mac Only” label:
Photos in macOS allows both imported
and referenced images. In Photos →
Preferences →General, if the box next to
Importing is checked, whenever you drag
media in or use the File →Import option,
images and videos are copied to your
Photos library. Uncheck that, and the
image is referenced from the location on 
your Mac, including external drives.
Referenced images are not synced to 
iCloud Photo Library.
If you’re trying to figure out which are
referenced and which are not, Apple puts

a subtle icon in the corner of all
referenced images—it looks like a
rectangle with an arrow pointing to the 
middle right from the lower right.
But you can also create a smart album 
that collects all these.
> Select File →New Smart Album.
> In criteria, choose Photo, Is, 
Referenced.
> Name the album something 
descriptive.
> Click OK.
You can select any referenced media
and then choose File →Consolidate, and
you’ll be prompted to copy the media
into your Photos library, which will also
re-point that thumbnail reference to the 
imported one.
How to upgrade a drive
with High Sierra and APFS
The new Apple File System (APFS) that
replaces the long-running HFS+ in macOS
caused a lot of concern and confusion,
because it seemed like a massive change,
but the effects aren’t noticeable to end
users, except in improving the speed of
SSD-only Macs. (Apple doesn’t upgrade 
hard drives to APFS, and hasn’t yet
released a Fusion APFS update for its 
mixed SSD/hard-drive systems.)
APFS restructures how files are stored
in a disk partition, but it doesn’t change
how programs access files within the 
operating system. When copying
individual files or cloning a drive with Disk 
Utility, SuperDuper, or Carbon Copy
Cloner (go.macworld.com/carb; $40),
macOS continues to abstractly interact
with files, so you don’t have to learn
anything about the filesystem to use it or
to use cloning software. (That’s just so
long as the cloning software is up to date. 
Carbon Copy Cloner released a major 
update for APFS a while ago, and
SuperDuper finished its beta testing and
released an APFS-ready version 3.0 on 
November 8.)
Macworld reader Doyle wonders if
any of this causes issues when migrating
from one drive to another. He wants to
upgrade from his existing SSD to one
that’s larger, and he’s previously relied on
Disk Utility. Because Apple has provided
much detail about APFS, he’s concerned 

JANUARY 2018 MACWORLD 121
that this might not
work this time out.
He’d prefer to use
Disk Utility, but isn’t
opposed to buying
a piece of software
to clone if it would 
provide extra 
abilities.
The good news
is you can use Disk Utility just as you have
in previous releases to migrate a drive.
You need to format the new drive with
APFS before initiating the clone, and you
can boot into Recovery as in the past to 
perform the clone.
However, there’s one thing that Disk
Utility cannot manage: installing a new
Recovery Disk on a freshly formatted
macOS drive. For that, you need Carbon 
Copy Cloner or SuperDuper, both of
which can clone an existing Recovery
Disk onto another drive. Apple only
supports creating this very critical piece
of macOS troubleshooting, also required
for using FileVault, when you perform a
full macOS installation. (SuperDuper can’t
use HFS+ as a destination for cloning a
Recovery Disk, however. Read this blog
post for more particulars [go.macworld.
com/reco].)
If you want to use an all-Disk Utility
method in High Sierra, you need to follow 
these steps:
> Run macOS Installer for High Sierra
and complete a full installation on the new 
drive.
> When finished, restart and choose 
Recovery (Command-R at startup).
> Launch Disk Utility from the Recovery 
startup list.
> Control-click the new main partition
on your new drive and choose Restore.
> Select your old drive’s main partition 
in the Restore From menu and click 
Restore.
With Carbon Copy Cloner or
SuperDuper, you can follow either
program’s instructions to clone the
Recovery partition, and skip step 1 above.
This eliminates installing macOS, which
can take some time. Then, you can follow 
steps 2 to 5 and complete the clone.
If you need to swap a drive out of your
Mac instead of having both connected at 
once, I’d recommend using either
SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner to
help with that after either installing macOS 
Disk Utility lets you restore from another mounted drive or a disk 
image, effectively cloning a drive.

on the external drive or using 
Carbon Copy Cloner or
SuperDuper to clone 
Recovery. Then:
> Make a clone of your
current drive either as a
complete partition or as a disk
image on an external drive
using either app (or update an 
existing clone).
> Shut your Mac down and
swap the internal drive for the 
new one.
> Boot into Recovery.
> Launch Disk Utility from the Recovery 
startup list.
> Control-click the new main partition
on your new drive and choose Restore.
> Select the clone if it’s a partition or
click Image to select a disk image backup 
and click Restore.
Is there any way to shorten the
available Wi-Fi list in macOS
and iOS? Unfortunately, no.
macOS and iOS displays a list of the Wi-Fi
networks in your area, whether they are
private or not. This can be helpful, but
how often are you able to really use a
private network you can see but know 
nothing about?
Macworld reader Michael is irritated by
the huge list of Wi-Fi networks around him
whenever he tries to connect in iOS. He’s 
in a densely populated city, and neighbors’ 
networks are all around him. Since he’s
connected to his own network and he’ll
never connect to any of the others, is
there a way to make them not appear in 
his list?
It’s a good question and one I honestly
never thought about in 17 years of writing 
about Wi-Fi. The network scanning
features built into Wi-Fi user interfaces on
every platform I can think of that let you
select a network are designed to maximize 
what you see. They weren’t created for
crowded network environments, and a
re-think would make a lot of sense, since
we mostly don’t want to connect to any 
network, nor see them.
However, for now you’ve got to ignore 
it. When you click the Wi-Fi menu in
macOS or visit Settings →Wi-Fi in iOS,
you’ll always see the currently connected 

JANUARY 2018 MACWORLD 123
network at the top, but all the other 
networks will always appear.
There is one not-so-convenient-and-
easy way you could solve this problem.
Install a wire mesh in the floor, ceiling, and
the inside portion of your home’s exterior 
walls to create a Faraday cage (go.
macworld.com/fara), which blocks
penetration of a lot of forms of
electromagnetic fields—which includes
radio signals—and you’ll likely only see 
other networks when you open the 
front door.
What are offloaded apps in iOS 
11 and how do they work?
Prior to iOS 11, once an app was installed
on an iOS device, you either kept it or
removed it. Removing it would cause iOS
to prompt you first with a warning that all
associated data on your device would also
be removed. Some iOS apps get around
this by using web-based or app-based
accounts or other associations, so if you 
later reinstall the app, you can relink 
your data.
iOS 11 introduced a wrinkle that
Macworld reader Audrey unintentionally
asked a question about, because it came
up in a different context when she was
restoring an iCloud backup from an older
phone to her iPhone 8 Plus, and she was
prompted to enter the password of an
Apple ID she hasn’t used in six years:
Several of my apps appeared with
“ghost cloud” little icons next to their
names on the iPhone screen. Apple
Store specialists said those were tied to
that old Apple ID, but that wasn’t true.
Many NEW apps I recently got or paid
for with my current Apple ID had those
“ghost clouds” and did NOT show up on
my Purchases list in the App Store app.
The old Apple ID part, I don’t know
what that’s about. Apple should only
prompt you for an Apple ID for iCloud. If
you use a separate account for purchases 
from the App Store and other Apple
stores, you may be prompted for that
password, too. If you have apps or content
installed registered to another account,
you can also be prompted, but Audrey
says that’s not the case and she hasn’t
been prompted through years of other
updates and phone transfers. Let’s put that 
to the side, as I don’t have an answer.
I can explain what’s going on with the
cloud icon, however. If you see an iCloud
download icon to the left of an app’s name,
it’s supposed to indicate that you offloaded
the app. Offload App is a new option that I 
can’t find Apple has documented in a
support note, and it’s only available if you
go to a specific spot in Settings to use it.
Offloaded apps are removed, reducing
the storage burden of their core program,
but any associated documents and data 

124 MACWORLD JANUARY 2018

remain on your iOS device. The app icon
remains, which is useful for recalling it to
life. You can then tap to re-install it and be
returned to the state you were in when you
deleted it, rather than having to reconfigure 
it. It’s a neat compromise. (A neat extra
feature: these offloaded apps show up in
Siri searches, and you can tap the search
result icon, and it will start downloading the 
app without additional intervention.)
I wondered if Apple wasn’t ready to
promote the feature, since I can’t find a 
mention of it outside of developer
documents and forums that are publicly 
reachable via a Google search.
When you normally delete an app, you 
know the drill:
> Hold down on any app on any Home
screen for a couple seconds. (On a device
with 3D Touch, don’t pop or peek, just place 
your finger on the app on the screen 
without force.)
> All the app icons and folders jiggle.
> Tap the X in the upper left corner of 
an app.
> In the dialog that appears, tap Delete 
to remove it.
However, to offload an app, you have 
to use these steps:
> Go to Settings → General → iPhone 
Storage.
> Wait for apps to load at the bottom of 
the screen.
> Scroll to an app you want to offload 
and then tap it.
> Tap Offload App.
> Confirm your action by tapping Offload
App in the explanatory dialog that appears.
I’m baffled both about Apple’s lack of
information and Audrey’s experience, but
at least I can explain the ghost cloud. ■
