TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE 
T
HIS celebrated essay was first pub­
lished in the Revue de M ctaphysique 
et de Morale, in January, 1903. 
It ap­
peared then after Time and Ji'ree Will and 
Matter and Memory and before Creative 
Evolution j and while containing ideas set 
forth in the first two of these works, it 
announces some of those which were after­
wards developed in the last. 
Though this book can in no sense be 
regarded as an epitome of the others, it 
yet forms the best introduction to them. 
M. Edouard Le Roy in his lately published 
book on M. Bergson's philosophy speaks of 
" this marvelously suggestive study which 
<'onstitutes the best preface to the books 
themselves." 
It has, however, more importance than a 
flimple introduction would have, for in it 
l\1. Bergson explains, at greater length and 
in greater detail than in the other books,

exactly what be means to convey by the 
word intuition. 
The intuitive method is 
treated independently and not, as elsewhere 
in his writings, incidentally, in its appli­
cations to particular problems. 
For this 
reason every writer who bas attempted to 
give a complete exposition of M. Bergson's 
philosophy has been obliged to quote this 
eRsay at length ; and it is indispensable 
therefore to the full understanding of its 
author's position. 
Translations into Ger­
man, Italian, Hungarian, Polish, Swedish, 
and Russian have lately appeared, but the 
l"rP.nch original is at present out of print. 
This translation bas had the great ad­
vantage of being revised in proof by the 
author. 
I have to thank him for many 
alternative renderings, and also for a few 
slight alterations in the text, which he 
thought would make his meaning clearer.

A 
An Introduction to 
Metaphysics 
COMPARISON of the definitions of 
metaphysics and the various concep-
tions of the absolute leads to the discovery 
that philosophers, in spite of their apparent 
divergencies, agree in distinguishing two 
profoundly different ways of knowing a 
thing. 
The 
first 
implies that 
we 
move 
round the object; the second that we enter 
into it. 
The first depends on the point of 
view at which we are placed and on the 
symbols by which we express ourselves. 
The second neither depends on a point of 
view nor relies on any symbol. 
The first 
kind of knowledge may be said to stop at 
the 
relative; the 
second, in those cases 
where it is possible, to attain the absolute. 
I

An Introduction to 
Consider, for example, the movement of 
an object in space. 
l\Iy perception of the 
motion will vary with the point of view, 
moving or stationary, from which I observe 
it. 
LIM· expression of it will vary with the 
systems of axes, or the points of reference, 
to which I relate it; that is, with the sym­
bols 
by which 
I 
translate it. 
For this 
double reason I call such motion relative: 
in the one l'al'le, as in the other, I am placed 
nnt!oliclP thc• ohjPct itself. 
Rut when I speak 
of an absolute movement, I am attributing 
to tbt> mewing object an interior and, so to 
Rpeak, stateR of mind; I also imply that I 
am in sympathy with those states, and that 
I inRt>rt myRelf in them by an effort of 
imagination. 
Then, according as the ob­
ject iH moving or stationary, according as 
it adopts one movement or another, what 
I experience will vary. 
And what I ex­
JWrienee will depend neither on the point 
of viPw I may take up in regard to the 
ohjt>ct, sine(> I am inHide the object itself, 
nor on the f!ymhols hy which I may t.rana·

late the motion, since I have rejected all 
translations in order to possess the original. 
In short, I shall no longer grasp the move­
ment from without, remaining where I am, 
but from where it is, from within, as it is 
in itself. 
I shall possess an absolute. 
Consider, again, a character whose ad­
ventures are related to me in a novel. 
The 
author may multiply the traits of his hero's 
character, may make him speak and act as 
much as he pleases, but all this can never 
be equivalent to the simple and indivisible 
feeling which I should experience if I were 
able for an instant to identify myƎelf with 
the person of the hero himself. 
Out of that 
indivisible feeling, as from a spring, all the 
words, gestures, and actions of the man 
would appear to me to 1low naturally. 
They would no longer be accidents which, 
added to the idea I had already formed of 
the character, 
continually enriched 
that 
idea, 
without 
ever 
completing 
it. 
The 
character would be given to me all at once, 
in its entirety, and the thousand incidents

which manifest it, instead of adding them­
t«>lves to the idea and so enriching it, would 
seem to me, on the contrary, to detach 
themselveR from it, without, however, ex­
hausting it or· impoverishing its essence. 
All the thingyo I am told ahout the man

the person himself would alone give me 
the absolute. 
It is in this sense, and in this sense only, 
that absolute is synonymous with perfec­
tion. 
Were all the photographs of a town, 
taken from all possible points of view, to 
go on indefinitely completing one another, 
they would never be equivalent to the solid 
town in which we walk about. 
Were all 
the translations of a poem into all possible 
languages to add together their various 
shades of meaning and, correcting each 
other by a kind of mutual retouching, to 
give a more and more faithful image of 
the poem they translate, they would yet 
never succeed in rendering the inner mean­
ing of the original. 
A representation taken 
from a certain point of view, a translation 
made with certain symbols, will always 
remain imperfect in comparison with the 
object of which a view has been taken, or, 
which the symbols seek to express. 
But the 
absolute, which is the object and not its 
representation, the original and not its 

6 
An Introduction to 
translation, is perfect, by being perfectly 
what it is. 
It is doubtless for this reason that the 
absolute has often been identified with the 
infinite. 
Suppose that I wished to com­
municate to some one who did not know 
Greek the extraordinarily simple impres­
sion that a passage in Homer makes upon 
me; I should first give a translation of the 
lines, I should then comment on my trans­
lation, and then develop the commentary; 
in this way, by piling up explanation on 
explanation, I might approach nearer and 
nearer to what I wanted to express; but I 
should never quite reach it. 
When you 
raise your arm, you accomplish a movement 
of which you have, from within, a simple 
perception; but for me, watching it from 
the outside, your arm passes through one 
point, then through another, and between 
these two there will be still other points; 
so that, iC I began to count, the operation 
would go on for ever. 
Viewed from the 
.... 
-. . .  
inside, then, an absolute is a simple thing; 

Metaphysics

but looked at from the outside, that is to 
say, relatively to other things, it becomes, 
in relation to these signs which express it, 
the gold coin for which we never seem able 
to finish giving small change. 
Now, that 
which lends itself at the same time both 
to an indivisible apprehension and to an 
inexhaustible enumeration is, by the very 
definition of the word, an infinite. 
It follows from this that an absolute 
could only be given in an intuition, whilst 
everything else falls within the province of 
analysis. 
By intuition is meant the kind 
of ·intellectual sympathy by which one 
places oneself within an object in order to 
coincide with what is unique in it and con­
sequently inexpressible. 
Analysis, on the 
contrary, is the operation which reduces the 
object to elements already known, that is, 
to elements common both to it •and other 
objects. 
To analyze, therefore, is to ex­
press a thing as a function of something 
other than itself. 
All analysis is thus a 
translation, a development into symbols, a 

8 
An Introduction to 
representation taken from successive points 
of view from which we note as many re­
semblances as possible 
between 
the new 
object which we are studying and otherĎo 
which we believe we know alreacly. 
In its 
eternally unsatisfied desire to emh1·ace the 
object around 
which it is compelled 
to 
turn, analyRis multiplies without end the 
number of itR pointR of view in order to 
complete its always incomplete representa­
tion, and ceaselessly varies its symbols that 
it may perfect the always imperfect tramŁ­
lation. 
lt goes on, therefore, to infinity. 
Rut intuition, if intuition is possible, is a 
simple act. 
Now it is eafoly to se that the ordinary 
function of 
positive 
seienee iR 
analyshࣁ. 
Positive science works, then, above all, with 
symbols. 
Even the most. conerde of the 
natural sciences, those concerned with life, 
confine themselves to the visible form of 
living beings, their organs and anatomita I 
elements. 
They make comparisons between 
these forms, they reduce the more complex 

Metaphysics 
to the more simple; in short, they study 
the workings of life in what is, so to speak, 
only its visual symbol. 
If there exists any 
means of possessing a reality absolutely in­
stead of knowing it relatively, of placing 
oneself within it instead of looking at it 
from outside pofnts of view, of having the 
intuition instead of making the analysis : 
in short, of seizing it without any expres­
sion, translation, or symbolic representation 
-metaphysics is that means. _A!_etaphysicsJ

'.r.IJǗre .is .one reality, at least, which WE 
Ţ4ţ_seize from within, by intuition and no1 
by simple analysis. 
It is our own person· 
ality in its flowing through time--{)ur sell 
which endures. 
We may sympathize in· 
tellectually with nothing else, but 
WE 
certainly sympathize with our own selves. 
When I direct my attention inward t< 
contemplate my own self (supposed for >t3E 

10 
An Introduction to 
moment to be inactive), I perceive at first, 
as a crust solidified on the surface, all the 
perceptions which come to it from the 
material world. These perceptions are clear, 
distinct, juxtaposed or juxtaposable one 
with another; they tend to group them­
selves into objects. 
Next, 
I notice the 
memories which more or less adhere to 
these perceptions and which serve to in­
terpret them. 
These memories have ben 
detachNl, as it were, from the depth of my 
])Crsonality, drawn to the surface by the 
perceptions which resemble them; they rest 
on the surface of my mlnd without being 
absolutely myself. 
LastlƂ·, I feel the stir of 
tendencies and motor bahits-a crowd of 
virtual actions, more or less firmly bound 
to these perceptions and memm·ies .. 
•-All 
these clearly defint.>d elements appear more 
distinct from me, the more distinct they 
m·e from each other. 
Radiating, as they 
do, from within outwards, tlJey form, col­
ledively, the surface of a sphere which 
teΖu}R to grow larger and lose itself in the 

Metaphysics 
II 
exterior world. 
But if I draw myself in 
from the periphery towards the centre, if I 
search in the depth of my being that which 
is most uniformly, most constantly, and 
most enduringly myself, I find an altogether 
different thing. 
There is, beneath these sharply cut crys­
tals and this frozen surface, a continuous 
flux which is not comparable to any flux I 
have ever seen. 
There is a succession of 
states, each of which announces that which 
follows and contains that which precedes 
it. 
They can, properly speaking, only be 
said to form multiple states when I have 
already passed them and turn back to ob­
serve their track. 
Whilst I was experien­
cing them they were so solidly organized, so 
profoundly animated with a common life, 
that I could not have said where any one 
of them finished or where another com­
menced. 
In reality no one of them begins 
or ends, but all extend into each other. 
This inner life may be compared to the 
unrolling of a coil, for there is no living

An Introduction to 
being 
who does not feel himself coming 
gradually to the end of his r<ile; and to 
live is to grow old. 
llut it ma.r ju!4t as 
well be compared to a continual rolling np. 
like that of a thread on a ba II, fo1· our past 
follows us, it swells incessantly with the 
present that it pickH up on its way; and 
consciousness means memory. 
But actually it is neither an unrolling 
nor a rolling up, for these two similes t>voke 
the idea of lines and surfaces \Vhose parts 
are homogeneous and superposable on one 
another.+ Now, there are no two id{'utkal 
moments in the life of the same consdous 
being. 
Take the t-impleHt senHatiou, sup· 
poRe it constant, abtmrb in it the entire 
JX'rsonality: the consciommess which will 
accompany 
this sensation cannot 
I't>main 
idl'nticnl with itself for two eonࣀt>l'ntive 
moments, because the seeond moment al­
ways contains, over and above the first, the 
memory that the first has hequeatbed to it. 
A consciousness which could experience two 
identical moments would be a consciousness 

Metaphysics 
13 
without memory. 
It would die and be born 
again continually. 
In what other way 
could one represent unconsciousness? 
It would be better, then, to use as a 
comparison 
the 
myriad-tinted spectrum, 
with its insensible gradations leading from 
one shade to another. 
A current of feeling 
whieh passed along the Α'Pt>Ctrum, aBRuming 
in turn the tint of eaeh of its shades, woulrl 
experience a series of gradual changes, each 
of which would announce the one to follow 
and would sum up thoRe which preceded 
it. 
Yet even here the successive shades of 
the spectrum always remain external one 
to another. 
They are juxtaposed ; they 
occupy space. 
But pure duration, on the 
contrary, excludes all idea of juxtapmΏition, 
reciprocal externality, and extension. 
Let us, then, rather, imagine an infinitely 
small elastic bod.v, contracted, if it were 
possible, to a mathematical point. 
J.Rt this 
he flrawn out gradually in such a manner 
that from the point comes a constantly 
lengthening line. 
Let us fix our attention 

14 
An Introduction to 
not on the line as 
a 
line, 
but on the 
action by which it is traced. 
Let us bear 
in mind that this action, in spite of its 
duration, is indivisible if accomplished with­
out stopping, that if a stopping-point is in­
serted, we have two actions instead of one, 
that each of these separate actions is then 
the indivisible operation of which we speak, 
and that it is not the moving action itself 
which is divisible, but, rather, the Rtation­
ary line it leaves behind it as its track in 
space. 
Finally, let us free ourselves from 
the space which underlies the movement in 
order to consider only the movement itself, 
the act of tension or extension; in short, 
pure mobility. 
We shall have this time a 
more faithful image of the. development of 
our self in duration. 
However, even this image is incomplete, 
and, indeed, every comparison will be in­
sufficient, 
because 
the 
unrolling 
of 
our 
duration resembles in some of its aspectH 
the unity of an advancing movement and 
. in others the multiplicity of 
expanding 

Metaphysics 
15 
states; and, clearly, no metaphor can ex­
press one of these two aspects without 
sacrificing the other. 
If I use the com­
parison of the spectrum with its thousand 
shades, I have before me a thing already 
made, whilst duration is continually in the 
,. 
making. 
If I think of an elastic which is 
being -stretched, or of a spring which is 
extended or relaxed, I forget the richness of 
color, characteristic of duration that is 
lived, to see O!J.ly the simple movement by 
which consciousness passeR from one shade 
to another. 
The inner life iş

once : variety of qualities, continuity of 
progress, and unity of direction. 
It cannot 
be represented by images. 
But it is even less possible to represent 
it by concepts, that is by abstract, general, 
or simple ideas. 
It is true that no image 
can reproduce exactly the original feeling 
I have of the flow of my own conscious life. 
But it is not even necessary that I should 
attempt to render it. 
If a man is incapable 
of getting for himself the intuition of the 

16 
An Introduction to 
constitutive duration of his own being, 
nothing will ever give it to him, concepts 
.no more than images. 
Here the single aim 
of the philosopher should be to promote a 
certain effort, which in most men is usually 
fettered by habitt of mind more uΐful to 
life. 
Now the image hat at least this ad­
vantage, that it keeps us in the concrete. 
Nu image can replace the intuition of dura­
tion, :but many diverse images, borrowed 
from very different orders of thinbrs, may, 
hy the convergence of their action, direct 
l'onsciousnets to the prt'eise point where 
there iH a certain intuition to be seized. 
By choosing images as dissimilar as pos­
sible, we shall prevent any one of them 
from usurping the pla('e of the intuition it 
is intended to call up, since it would then 
be driven away at once by its rivals. 
By 
providing that, in spite of their differences 
of aspect, the,v all require from the mind 
the same kind of attention, and in some 
sort the same degree of tension, we shall 
gradually accustom consciousness to a par-

Metaphysics 
17 
ticular and clearly-defined disposition-that 
precisely which it must adopt in order to 
appear to itself as it really is, without any 
veil. 
But, 
then, 
consciousness must 
at 
least consent to make the effort. 
For it 
will 
have 
been 
shown 
nothing: 
it 
will 
simply have been placed in t he attitude it 
must 
take up in order to make the de­
sired effort, and so come by itself to the 
intuition. 
Concepts 
on 
the 
contrary­
e8pecially 
if 
they 
are 
simple-have 
the 
ditW.dvantage of being in reality symbols 
substituted for the object they symbolize, 
and demand no effort on our part. 
Ex­
amined closely, each of them, it would be 
sen, retains only that part of the object 
whi(·h is common to it and to others, and 
eXIJ!esseࢿ1 still more than the image does, 
a compa1·ison between the object and others 
which rc>semble it. 
But as the comparison 
baN made manifest a resemblance, as the 
reƃowmiJlance is a property of the object, anrl 
as a property has Pvery appearance of being 
a part of the object which possesses it, we 

18 
An Introduction to 
easily persuade ourselves that by setting 
concept beside concept we are reconstruct­
ing the whole of the object with its parts, 
thus obtaining, so to speak, its intellectual 
equivalent.-£2 this way we believe that we 
can form a faithful representation of dura­
tion by setting in line the concepts of 
unity, multiplicity, continuity, finite or in­
finite divisibility, etc. 
There precisely is 
the illusion. 
There also 
is the danger. 
Just in so far as abstract ideas can render 
service to analysis, that is, to the scientific 
study of the object in its relations to other 
objects, so far are they incapable of replac­
ing intuition, that is, the metaphysical in­
vestigation of what is essential and unique 
in the object. 
For on the one hand these 
concepts, laid side by side, never actua1ly 
give us more than an artificial reconstruc­
tion of the object, of which they can only 
symbolize certain general, and, in a way, 
impersonal aspects; it is therefore useless 
to believe that with them we can seize a 
reality of which they present to us the 

Metaphysics 
19 
shadow alone. 
And, on the other hand, 
besides the illusion there is also a very 
serious danger. 
For the concept general­
izes at the same time as it abstracts. 
The 
concept can only symbolize a particular 
property by making it common to an in­
finity of things. 
It therefore always more 
or· less deforms the property by the exten­
sion it gives to it. 
Replaced in the meta­
physical object 
to 
which 
it 
belongs, 
a 
property coincides with the object, or at least 
moulds itself on it, and adopts the same 
outline. 
Extracted from the metaphysical 
object, and presented in a concept, it grows 
indefinitely larger, and goes beyond the 
object itself, since henceforth it has to con­
tain it, along with a number of other objects. 
Thus the different concepts that we form of 
the properties of a thing inscribe round it 
1:10 many circles, each much too large and 
none of them fitting it exactly. 
And yet, 
in the thing itself the properties coincided 
with the thing, and coincided consequently 
with one another. 
So that if we are bent 

20 
An Introduction to 
on reconstructing the object with concepts, 
some artifice mnst be sought whereby this 
coineidt>nce of the object and its properties 
can be brought about. 
For example, we 
may ehoose one of the concepts and try, 
starting from it, to get round to the others. 
B11t we Rhall tht>n soon discover that ac­
corlling as we start from one concept OI' 
anotlJPr, the meeting and combination of 
the eoneepts will take place in an altogether 
different way. 
According as we start, for 
example, from unity m· from mnltiplieity, 
we shall have t o  conceive ditl't>rentl.r the 
nmltiple unity 
of duration. 
Everything 
will depend on the weight we attribute to 
thiR or that concept, and this weight will 
always be arhitrat·y, since the concept ex· 
tJ·acted ft•om the object has no weight, being 
only the shatlo\\' of a body. 
In this way, 
as many different systems will spring up 
ns the1·e are external points of view from 
which the reality can be examined, or larger 
cireles in which it tࢾan h£> l:'nclose1l. 
Aimplt> 
concepts haw, then, not only the incon· 

Metaphysics 
21 
venience of dividing the concrete unity of 
the object into so many symbolical expres­
sions; they also divide philosophy into dis­
tinct schools, each of which takes its seat, 
chooses its counters, and carries on with 
the others a game that will never end. 
Either metaphysics is only this play of 
ideas, or else, if iš is a serious occupation 
of the mind, if it is a science and not simply 
an exercise, it must transcend concepts in 
order to reach intuition. 
Certainly, conJ 
--
/ 
cepts are necessary to it, ·for all the other 
---· 
sciences work as a rule with concepts, and 
metaphysics cannot dispense with the other 
sciences. 
But it is only truly itself when 
it goes beyond the concept, or at least when 
it frees itself from rigid and ready-made 
concepts in order to create a kind very dif­
ferent from those which we habitually use; 
I mean supple, mobile, and almost fluid 
representations, always ready to mould 
themselves on the fleeting forms of intui­
tion. 
We shall return later to this import­
ant point . ..1 Let it suffice us for the moment 

22 
An Introduction to: 
to have shown that r duration can be 
presented to us dire:Jl in an intuition, 
that it can be suggested to us indirectly 
by images, but that it can never-if we 
confine the word concept to its proper 
meaning-be 
enclosed 
in 
a 
conceptual 
representation. 
Let us try for an instant to consider our 
duration as a multiplicity. 
It will then be 
necessary to add that the terms of this 
multiplicity, instead of ˞eing distinct, as 
they are in any other multiplicity, encroach 
on one another; and that while we can no 
doubt, by an effort of imagination, solidify 
dm-ation once it has elapsed, divide it into 
juxtaposed portions and count all these 
portions, yet this operation is accomplished 
on the frozen memory of the duration, on 
the stationary trace which the mobility of 
duration leaves behind it, and not on the 
duration itself. 
We must admit, therefore, 
that if there is a multiplicity here, it bears 
no resemblance to any other multiplicity 
we know. 
Shall we say, then, that dura· 

Metaphysics 
23 
tion has unity? 
Doubtless, a continuity of 
elements which prolong themselves into one 
another participates in unity as much as 
in multiplicity; but this moving, changing, 
colored, living unity has hardly anything 
in common with the abstract, motionless, 
and empty unity which the concept of pure 
unity 
circumscribes. 
Shall we 
conclude 
from this that duration must be defined as 
unity and multiplicity at the same time? 
But singularly enough, however much I 
manipulate 
the 
two 
concepts,

thing 
which 
resembles 
the 
simple 
in·

while, 
on the contrary, when I replace myself in 
duration by an effort of intuition, I im­
mediately percW.ve how it is unity, multi­
plicity, 
and 
many other things besides.,. 
These different concepts, then, were only so 
many standpoints' from 
which we could 
consider duration. 
Neither separated nor

An Introduction to 
reunited have they made us penetrate into 
it. 
We do penetrate into it, however, and 
that can only be by an effort of intuition. 
In this sense, an inner, absolute knowledgl:' 
of the duration of the self hy t he self hࢽ 
possible. 
But if metaphysics here demands 
aml can obtain an intuition, science baR 
none the less need of an analysis. 
Now 
it 
is 
a 
confusion 
between 
t he 
function 
of analysis and that of intuition wbieh 
gives 
birth 
to 
the 
discussions 
hetwf'en 
the 
schools 
and 
the 
conflicts 
between 
systems. 
Psychology, in fact, proceeds like all the 
other sciences by analysis. 
It resolves the 
self, which bas been given to it at first in 
a simple intuition, into sensations, feeling8, 
ideas, etc., which it Rtudies separately. 
It 
substitutes, then, for the self a series of 
elements 
which 
form 
the 
faets 
of psy· 
chology. 
But 
are 
the!'W 
elements 
really 
parts? 
That is the whole question, and it 
is because it has ben evaded that the 

Metaphysics 
problem of human personality has so often 
ben stated in insoluble terms. 
It is incontestable ˟hat every psychical 
state, simply because it belongs to a per­
son, reflects the whole of a personality. 
Every feeling, however simple it may be, 
contains 
virtually 
within 
it 
the 
whole 
past and present of the being experiencing 
it, and, consequently, can only be separated 
and .constituted into a " state " by an effort 
of abstraction or of analysis. 
But it is no 
less incontestable that without this effort 
of abstraction or analysis there would be 
no possible development of the science of 
psychology. 
What, 
then, 
exactly, is the 
operation by which a _psycholo$ detaches 
a mental state in order to erect it into a 
more or less independent entity? 
He be­
gins by neglecting that special coloring 
of the personality which cannot be ex­
pressed 
in 
known 
and 
common 
terms. 
Then he endeavors to isolate, in the person 
already thus simplified, some aspect which 
lends itself to an interesting inquiry. 
If 

26 
An Introduction to 
be is considering inclination, for example, 
be 
will 
neglect the inexpressible 
shade 
which colors it, and which makes the in­
clination mine and not yours; he will fix 
his attention on the movement by which 
our personality leans towards a 
certain 
object: he will isolate this attitude, and it 
is this special aspect of the personality, this 
snapshot of the mobility of the inner life, 
this " diagram " 
of concrete inclination, 
that be will erect into 
an 
independent 
fact. 
There is in this something very like 
what an artist passing through Paris does 
when be makes, for example, a sketch of a 
tower of Notre Dame. 
The tower is in­
separably united to the bnilding, which is 
itst>lf no less inseparably united to the 
ground, to its surroundings, to the whole 
of Paris, and so on. 
It is first necessary 
to detach it from all these; only one aspect 
of the whole is noted, that formerl by the 
tower of Notre Dame. 
1\Ioreover, tbe Rpe­
cial form of this tower is due to the group­
ing of the stones of which it is composed; 

Metaphysics 
but the artist does not concern himself with 
these stones, he notes only the silhouette of 
the tower. 
For the real and internal organi­
zation of the thing he substitutes, then, an 
external and schematic representation. 
So 
that, on the whole, his sketch corresponds 
to an observation of the object from a cer· 
tain point of view and to the choice of a 
certain means of representation. 
But ex­
actly the same thing holds true of the 
operation by which the psychologist ex­
tracts a single mental state from the whole 
personality. 
This isolated psychical state 
is hardly anything but a sketch, the com­
mencement of an artificial reconstruction; 
it is the whole considered under a certain 
elementary aspect in which we are specially 
interested and 
which we have carefully 
noted. 
It is not a part, but an element. 
It has not been obtained by a natural 
dismemberment, but by analysis. 
Now beneath all the sketches he has made 
at Paris the visitor wil probably, by way 
of memento, write the word " Paris." 
And 

28 
An Introduction to 
as he has really seen Paris, he will he able, 
with the help of the original intuition he 
had of the whole, to place his sketcheH 
thert:•in, and so join thPm up together. 
But 
there is no way of performing the inverl"e 
operation ; it iv impossible, ewn with an 
infinite number of accurate sketches, and 
even with the word " Paris "  which intli· 
cates that they must be combined togethf•r, 
to get back to an intuition that one hat,J 
newr had, and to give one!'lelf an imp1-ession 
of what Paris is like if one has never seen 
it. 
This is lwcauRe we are not tlealing here 
with real p!1rt:ࢻ, but with mere notes of the 
total 
imprf'sRion. 
To 
take 
a 
still 
more 
striking example, 
where the notation 
is 
mOJ"e completely symbolic, snppnŀ that T 
am shown, mixed together at random, the 
letters 
'"bi(·h 
make 
up 
a 
poPrn 
I 
am 
ignorant of. 
If the lettf'rs were parts of 
the p()('m, I could attempt to rf'eonstitnte 
the poem with them hy trying tlw different 
poࢼࣃSihle arrangPments, as a child dnf'S with 
the pieces of a Chinese puzzle. 
But 
I 

Metaphysics 
29 
should never for a moment think of attempt­
ing such a thing in this case, because the 
letters are not component parts, but only 
partial expressions, which is quite a dif­
ferent thing. 
That is why, if I know the 
poem, I at once put each of the letters in 
its proper place and join them up without 
difficulty 
by 
a 
continuous 
connection, 
whilst the inverse operation is impossible. 
Even when I believe I am actually attempt­
ing this inverse operation, even when I put 
the letters end to end, I begin by thinking 
of some plausible meaning. 
I thereby give 
myself an intuition, and from this intuition 
I attempt to redescend to the elementary 
symbols which would reconstitute its ex­
pression. 
The very idea of reconstituting a 
thing by operations practised on symbolic 
elements alone implies such an absurdity 
that it would never occur to any one if 
they recollected that they were not dealing 
with fragments of the thing, but only, as 
it were, with fragments of its symbol. 
Such is, however, the undertaking of the 

30 
An Introduction to 
philosopherH who try to ret:onstruct per­
sonality with pĝoĚ·chkal states, whether t hey 
confine themselves to those l'tates alone, or 
whether they add a kind of thrlěa.d for the 
purpose of joining the states together. 
Bot h  
empiric·ists and rationalh•ts are victims nf 
the same fallacy. 
Both of them mistake 
partia.l n-otations fnr real parts, thus con­
fusing the point of viPw of analysis and 
of intuition, of scienee and of metaphy"ics. 
The empiricists Ray quite rightly that 
psychological 
analysiK 
d iseovers 
nothing 
more in personality than psychical states. 
liluch is, in fact, the function, and the ver· 
definition of analysis. 
The psychologist has 
nothing else tn do hut analyze JWI'I'onality, 
that is, to note certain states ; at the most 
he may put the label " ego '' on these states 
in saying they are "states of the ego," just 
as the artist writes the word "Paris" on 
eat•h of his sketches. 
On the level at which 
the 
ps_vchologist 
places 
himself, 
and 
on 
\vhich he mu8t place him!'lPlf, the "ego'' is 
only a sign by which the primitive, and 

Metaphysics 
31 
moreover very confused, intuition which 
has furnished the psychologist 
with his 
subject-matter is recalled; it is only a word, 
and the great error here lies in believing 
that while remaining on the same level we 
can find behind the word a thing. 
Such 
has been the error of those philosophers who 
have not been able to resign themselves to 
being only 
psychologists 
in 
psychology, 
Taine and Stuart Mill, for example. 
. 
Psy­
chologiin the method they apply, they 
have remained metaphysicians in the object 
they set before themselves. 
They desire an 
intuition, and by a strange inconsistency 
they seek thiR intuition in analysis, which 
is the very negation of u:-1 They look for 
the ego, and they claim tO" find it in psy­
chical states, though this diversity of states 
has itself only been obtained, and could only 
be obtained, by transporting oneself outside 
the ego altogether, so as to make a series 
of sketches, notes, and more or less symbolic 
and schematic diagrams. 
Thus, however 
much they place the states side by side, 

32 
An Introduction to 
m]Jltiplying points of contact and exploring 
the intervals, the ego always escapes them, 
so that they finish by seeing in it nothing 
but a vain phantom. 
We might as well 
deny that the Iliad had a meaning, on the 
ground that we had looked in vain for that 
meaning in the intervals between the letters 
of which it is composed. 
Philosophical empiricism is born here, 
then, of a confusion between the point of 
view of intuition and 
that of analysis. 
Reeking for the original in the translation, 
where naturally it cannot be, it denies the 
existence of the original on the ground that 
it ito not found in the translation. 
It leads 
of necessity to negations ; but on examining 
the matter closely, we perceive that these 
neĜatinns simply mean that analysis is not 
intuition, which is self-evident. 
From the 
original, and, one mm1t adrl, very indistinct 
intuition which gives positive science its 
material, 
l-lcience 
passes 
immediately to 
anal.n1h<, whi1·h multiplies to infinity its 
observations of this material from outside 

Metaphysics 
33 
points of view. 
It soon comes to believe 
that by putting together all these diagrams 
it can reconstitute the object itself. 
No 
wonder, then, that it sees this object fly be· 
fore it, like a child that would like to make 
a solid plaƵ'thing out of the shadows out· 
lined along the wall! 
But rationalism is the dupe of the same 
illusion. 
It starts out from the same con· 
fusion as empiricism, and remains equally 
powerless to rPach the inner splf. 
Like 
empiricism, it considers psychical states as 
so many fragments detached from an ego 
that hinds them together. 
Like empiricism, 
it tries to join these fragments together· in 
order to re-create the unity of the self. 
!.ike empiricism, finally, it sees this unity 
of the self, in the continually renewed effort 
it makes to clasp it, steal away indefinitely 
like a phantom. 
But whilst empiricism, 
weary of the struggle, ends by declarinƶ 
that there is nothing else but the multi· 
plieity of ps)·chical states, rationalism per· 
sists in affirming the 'tinity of the person; 

34 
An Introduction to 
It is true that, seeking this unity on the 
level of the psychical states themselves, and 
obliged, besides, to put down to the account 
of these states all the qualities and deter­
minations that it finds by analysis (since 
analysis by its very definition leads always 
to states), nothing is left to it, for the unity 
of personality, but something purely nega­
tive, the absence of all determination. 
The 
psychical states having necessarily in this 
analysis taken and kept for themselves 
everything that can serve as matter, the 
" unity of the ego " can never be more than 
a form without content. 
It will be abso­
lutely indeterminate and absolutely void. 
To 
these 
detached 
psychical 
states, 
to 
these shadows of the ego, the sum of which 
was for the empiricists the equivalent of 
the self, rationalism, in order to reconstitute 
personality, adds something still more un­
real, the void in which these shadows move 
-a place for shadows, one might say. 
How 
could this " form," which is,..if truth form­
less, serve to characterize a living, active, 

Metaphysics 
35 
concrete personality, or to distinguish Peter 
from Paul? 
Is it astonishing that the 
philosophers who have isolated this " form '' 
of personality should, then, find it insuf­
ficient to characterize a definite person, and 
that they should be gradually led to make 
their empty ego a kind of bottomless re­
ceptacle, which belongs no more to Peter 
than to Paul, and in which there is room, 
according to our preference, for entire hu­
manity, for God, or for existence in general? 
I Be in this matter only one dift'erence 
between empiricism and rationalism. 
The 
former, seeking the unity of the ego in 
the gaps, as it were, between the psychi­
cal states, is led to fill the 
gaps with 
other states, 
and so on 
indefinitely, 
so 
that the ego, compressed in a constantly 
narrowing interval, tends towards zero, as 
analysis is pushed farther and farther; 
whilst rationalism, making the ego the place 
where mental states are lodged, is confronted 
with an empty space which we have no rea­
son to limit here rather than there, which 

36 
An Introduction to 
goes beyond each of the successive boun­
daries that we try to assign to it, which 
constantly grows larger, and which tends 
to lose itself no longer in zero, but in the 
infinite. 
The distance, then, between a so-called 
"empiricism'' like that of Taine and the 
most transcendental speculations of certain 
German pantheists is very much less than is 
generally supposed. 
The method is analo­
gom in both cases; it consists in reason­
ing about the elements of a translation as 
if they were parts of the original. 
But a 
true empiricism is that which proposes to 
get as near to the original itself as pos· 
sible, to search deeply into its life, and so, 
by a kind of intellectual auscultation, to 
feel the throbbings of its soul; and thhĎ 
true empiricism is the true metaphysics. 
It 
is true that the task is an extremely diffi­
cult one, for none of the ready·made concep­
tions which thought employs in its daily 
operations can be of any use. 
X othing is 
more easy than to say that the ego is multi· 

Metaphysics 
37 
plicity, or that it is unity, or that it is the 
sƷ·nthesis of both. 
Unity and multiplicity 
are here representations that we have no 
need to cut out on the model of the object; 
they are found ready-made, and have only 
to be chosen from a heap. 
They are stock­
l'lize clothes which do just as well for Peter 
as for Paul, for they set off the form of 
nPither. 
But an empiriciRm worthy of the 
name, an empiricism which works only to 
measure, is obliged for each new object that 
it studies to make an absolutely fresh effort. 
It cuts out for the object a concept which 
is appropriate to that object alone, a con­
cept which can as yet hardly be called a 
concept, Rince it applies to this one thing. 
It does not proceed hy combining current 
ideas Jike unity and multiplicity; hut it 
leads us, on the contrary, to a simple, 
unique representation, which, however once 
formed, enableH us to understand easily how 
it is that we can place it in the frames 
unity, multiplicity, etc., all much larger 
than itƸlf. 
In short, philosophy thus. de· 

38 
An Introduction to 
fined does not consist in the choice of cer· 
tain concepts, and in taking sitles with a 
school, but in the search for a unique intui· 
tion from which we can desceml with equal 
ease to different concepts, because we are 
placed above the divisions of the schools. 
/ That personality has unity cannot be de­
nied ; but such an affirmation teaches one 
nothing about the extraordinary nature of 
the particular unity presented by person­
ality. 
That our self is multiple I also 
agre, but then it must be understood that 
it is a multiplicity which has nothing in 
common with any other multiplicity. 
What 
is really important for philosophy is to 
know exactly what unity, what multiplicity, 
and what reality superior both to abstraet 
unity and multiplicity the multiple unity 
of the self actually is. 
Now philosophy 
will know this only when it recovers pos­
session of the simple intuition of the self 
by the self. 
Then, according to tlw direc· 
tion it chooses for its descent from this 
summit, it will arrive at unity or multi-

Metaphysics 
39 
plicity, or at any one of the concepts by 
which we try to define the moving life of 
the self. 
But no mingling of these con­
cepts would give anything which at all 
resembles the self that endures. 
If we are shown a solid cone, we se with· 
out any dificulty how it narrows towards 
the summit and tends to be lost in a mathe· 
matical point, and also how it enlarges in 
the direction of the base into an indefinitely 
increasing circle. 
But neither the point 
nor the circle, nor the juxtaposition of the 
two on a plane, would give us the least 
idea of a cone. 
The same thing holds true 
of the unity and multiplicity of mental life, 
and of the zero and the infinite towards

personality. 
Concepts, as we shall show elsewhere, 
generally go together in couples and repre-. 
sent two contraries. 
There is hardly any 
concrete reality which cannot be observed 
from two opposing standpoints, which can­
not consequently be subsumed under two 

40 
An Introduction to 
antagonistic concepts. 
Hence a thesis and 
an antithesis which we endeavor in vain 
to reconcile logically, for the very simple 
reason that it is impossible, with concepts 
and obRervations taken from outside points 
of view, to make a thing. 
But from the 
object, seized by intuition,_ we pass easily 
in many cases to the two contrary conceptR ; 
and as in that. way thesis and antithesis can 
be seen to spring from reality, we grasp at 
the same time how it is that the two are 
opposed and how they are reconciled. 
It is true thut to accomplish this, it is 
necessary to pt·oceerl by a rcverRul of the 
usual work of the intellect. 
Think,in,q mm­
ally consists in paRHing from concept!- to 
things, and not from things to concepts. 
To know a reality, in the usual sense of the 
word " know,'' is to take ready-made con­
cepts, to portion them out and to mix them 
together until a practical equivalent of the 
reality is obtained. But it must be remem­
bered that the normal work of the intellect 
is far from being disinterested. 
We do not

knowledge, btrt . in order to take sides, to 
draw profit-in 01?r_t!_ ťŦŧ!Ũsũy a!!-_ interŪ 
est. 
We inquire up to what point the 
object we seek to know is this or that, to 
what known class it belongs, and what kind 
of action, bearing, or attitude it should 
suggest to us. 
These different possible 
actions and attitudes are so many concep· 
tual directions of our thought, determined 
once for all; it remains only to follow 
them : in that precisely consists the appli­
cation of concepts to things. 
To try to fit 
a concept on an object is simply to ask 
what we can do with the object, and what 
it can do for us. 
To label an object with 
a certain concept is to mark in precise terms 
the kind of action or attitude the object 
should suggest to us. All knowledge, prop­
erly so called, is then oriented in a certain

externally-taken view of the object, is to 
go against the end that we have chosen, to 
condemn philosophy to an eternal skirmish­
ing between the schools and to install con­
tradiction in the very heart of the object 
and of the method. 
Either there is no 
philosophy possible, and all knowledge of 
things is a practical knowledge aimed at 
the profit to be drawn from them, or else 
philosophy consists in placing oneself with­
iii Hie
-
object itself by an effort of intuition. 
But in order to understand the nature of 
this intuition, in order to fix with precision 
where intuition ends and where analysis 
begins, it is necessary to return to what waR 
said earlier about the flux of duration. 
It will be noticed that an essential char­
acteristic of the concepts and diagrams to 
which analysis leads is that, while being 
considered, thļ :rĽmain stationary. 
I iso­
late from the totality of interior life that 
psychical entity which I call a simple sensa· 
tion. 
So long as I study it, I suppose that 
it remains constant. 
If 
I noticed any 

44 
An Introduction to 
change in it, I should say that it was not 
a single sensation but several successive 
sensations, and I should then transfer to 
each of these successive senࣄoations the im­
mutability that I 
firflt 
attributed to t he 
total sensation. 
In any case I can, hy 
pushing the analysis far enough, always 
manuge to arrive at elements which I agree 
to conl'lider immutable. 
There, and there 
only, shall I find the Holid hasis of opera­
tions whh-b science needs for its own proper 
rlPvelopruent. 
* Hut, then, 
I cannot escape the objec­
tion that t here is no state of mind, how­
ever simpl«>, which does not change every 
moment, since there is no consciousnt•ss 
without memorn·. anti no continuation of a 
tdate wit hont the addition, to thP present 
((•£>ling, of tb/ mt'mory of paRt moment!-;. 
It 
is this which constitutes duration. 
Inner 
d m·ntion is the continuous life of a memory 
whieh prolou¨ the past into the present ,  
t hP present either containing within it i n  
a distinct 
form the ceaselessly 
growing 

Metaphysics 
45 
image of the past, or, more probably, show­
ing by its continual change of quality the 
heavier and still heavier load we drag be­
hind us as we grow older. 
Without this 
survival of the past into the present there 
would be no duration, but only instantaneity. 
Probably if I am thus accused of taking 
the mental state out of duration by the mere 
fact that I analyze it, I shall reply, " Is not 
each of these elementary psychical states, to 
which my analysis leads, itself a state which 
occupies time? 
My analysis," I shall say, 
" does indeed resolve the inner life into 
states, each of which is homogeneous with 
itself ; only, since the homogeneity extends 
over a definite number of minutes or of 
seconds, the elementary psychical state does 
not cease to endure, although it does not 
change." 
-
But, in saying that, I fail to se that the 
definite number of minutes and of seconds, 
which I am attributing here to the elemen­
tary psychical state, has simply the value of 
a sign intended to remind me that the psy-

46 
An Introduction to 
chkal state, suppo&'d homogeneous, is in 
reality a state which changes and endures. 
The state, taken in itself, is a perpetual 
heeoming. 
I have extracted from this be· 
l'nming a certain aYerage of quality, which 
I have suppoΕoed invariable ; I have in this 
way constituted a stable and consequently 
schematic state. 
I have, on the other hand, 
extracted from it Becoming in general, i. e., 
a becoming which is not the becoming of 
any particular thing, and this is what I 
have call<><l the time the statΎ occupies. 
Were I to look at it closely, I should se 
that this abstract time is as immobile for 
me as the state which I localize in it, that 
it could flow only by a continual change of 
quality, and that if it is without quality, 
merely the theatre of the change, it thus 
heromes an immobile medium. 
I should see 
that the construction of this homogeneous 
time is simply designed to facilitate the 
comparison between the different concrete 
durations, to permit us to count simulta· 
neities, and to measure one ftux of duration 

Metaphysics 
47 
in relation to another . .. And lastly I should 
understand that, in attaching the sign of 
a definite number of minutes and of seconds 
to the representation of an elementary psy· 
chical state, I am merely reminding myself 
and others that the state has been detached 
from an ego which endures, and merely 
marking 
out 
the 
place 
where 
it

again be set in movement in order to bring 
it back from the abstract schematic thing 
it has become to the concrete state it was 
at first. 
But I ignore all that, because it 
has nothing to do with analysis. 
This means that analysis operates always 
on the immobile;··whilst intuition places it-
--- . 
self in mobility, or, what comes to the same 
thing, in duration. 
There lies the very dis­
tinct line of demarcation between intuition 
and analysis. 
The real, the experienced, 
and the concrete are recognized by the fact 
that they are variability itself, the element 
by the fact that it is invariable. 
And the 
element is invariable by definition, being a 
diagram, a simplified reconstruction, often

a mere symbol, in any case a motionless 
view of the moving reality. 
('But the error consists in believing that 
we can reconstruct the real with these dia­
grams. 
As we have already said and may 
as well repeat here-frol1l_ intuition one can 
pass to analysis, but not from analysis to 
intuition. 
Out of variability we can make as many 
variations, qualities and modifications as we 
pll•ase, sim·e these are so many static views, 
taken by analysiN, of the mobility given to 
intuition. 
Rut theče modificationlil, put end 
to end, will prouuce nothing which re­
sembles variability, since they are not parts 
of it, but elements, which is quite a different 
thing. 
Cnmlider, for f>Xample, 
the 
variability 
whieh is nearest to homogeneity, that of 
movement in space. 
Along the whole of 
this movemt•nt we can imagine possible liltop· 
pages ; these are what we call the positions 
of the moving body, or the points hy which 
it passes. 
But with these positions, even 

.. 
Metaphysics 
49 
with an infinite number of them, we shall 
never make movement. 
They are not parts 
of the movement, they are so many snap­
shots of it ; they are, one might say, only 
supposed stopping-places. The moving bnilv 
v:.._.;,.ࢲ .. 
is never really in any of the pointsA the 
most we can say is that it passes through 
them. 
But passage, which is movement, has 
nothing in common with stoppage, which 
is immobility. 
A movement cannot be 
superposed on an immobility, or it would 
then coincide with it, which would be a 
contradiction. 
The points are not in the 
movement, as parts, nor even beneath it, 
as positions occupied by the moving body. 
They are simply projected by us under the 
movement, as so many places where a mov­
ing body, which by hypothesis does not 
stop, would be if it were to stop. 
They are 
not, therefore, properly speaking, positions, 
but " suppositions," aspects, or points of 
view of the mind. 
But how could we con­
struct a thing with points of view? 
Nevertheless, this is what we try to do 

so 
An Introduction to 
whenever we reason about movement, and 
also about time, for which movement serves 
as a means of representation. 
As a result 
of an illusion deeply rooted in our mind, 
and because we cannot prevent ourselves 
from considering analysis as the equivalent 
_of intuition, we begin by distinguishing 
along the whole extent of the movement, a 
certain number of possible stoppages or 
points, which we make, whether they like 
it or no, parts of the movement. 
Faced 
with our impotence to reconstruct the move­
ment with these points, we insert other 
points, believing that we can in this way 
get nearer to the essential mobility in the 
movement. 
Then, as this mobility still es· 
capes us, we substitute for a fixed and 
finite number of points an " indefinitely in­
creasing " number-thus vainly trying to 
counterfeit, by the movement of a thought 
that goes on indefinitely adding points to 
points, the real and .undivided motion of 
the moving body. 
Finally, we say that 
movement is composed of points, but that 

Metaphysics 
51 
it comprises, in addition, the obscure and 
ŕfsteriow;- passage from one position · to 
the next. 
As if the obscurity was not due 
entirely to the fact that we have supposed 
immobility to be clearer than mobility and 
rest anterior to movement ! 
As if the 
mystery did not follow entirely from our 
attempting 
to pass 
from 
stoppages 
to 
movement by way of addition, which is im­
possible, when it is so easy to pass, by 
simple diminution, from movement to the 
slackening of movement, and so to im· 
mobility !

treme limit of the slowing down of move-
ment, a limit reached only, perhaps, in 
thought and never realized in nature. What 
we have done is to seek for the meaning of 
the poem in the form of the letters of which 
it is composed ; we have believed that by 
considering an .increasing number of letters 
we would grasp at last the ever-escaping 
meaning, and in desperation, seeing that it

An Introduction to 
was ufoU>less to sek for a part of the sense 
in each of the letters, we have supposed 
that it was between each letter and the 
next that this long-sought 
fragment 
of 
the mysterious sense was lodged ! 
But the 
letters, it must be pointed out once again, 
are not parts of the thing, but elements of 
the symboL 
Again, the positions of the 
moving body are not parts of the move­
ment ; they are points of the space which 
iH 
suppol'led 
to 
underlie the movement. 
This empty and immobile space which is 
merely concPived, never perceived, has the 
vain£' of a R_vmhol only. 
How could you

llnt the symbol in this case responds to 
the most inveterate habits of our thought. 
We place ourselves as a rule in immobility, 
in which we find a point of support for 
practical purposes, and with this immo­
bil ity we try to reconst rud motion. We only 
ohtain in thiR wa,v a clumsy imitation, a 
counterfeit of real movement, but this imita-

Metaphysics 
53 
tion is much more useful in life than the 
intuition of the thing itself would be. 
Now 
our mind has an irresistible tendency to 
consider that idea clearest which is most 
often useful to it. 
That is why immobility 
sems to it clearer than mobility, and rest 
anterior to movement. 
The dimculties to which the problem of 
movement has given rise from the earliest 
antiquity have originated in this way. 
They 
result always from the fact that we insis t 
on passing from space to movement, from 
the trajectory to the flight, from immobile 
positions to mobility, and on passing from 
one to the other by way of addition. 
But 
it is movement which is anterior to im­
mobility, and the relation between positions 
and a displacement is not that of parts to 
a whole, but that of the diversity of pos­
sible points of view to the real indivisibility 
of the object. 
Many other problems are born of the 
same illusion. 
What stationary points are 
to the movement of a moving body, concepts

An Introduction to 
of different qualities are to the qualitative 
change of an object. 
The various concepts 
into which a change can be analyzed at·e 
therefore so many stable views of the in­
stability of the real. 
And to think of an 
object-in the usual meaning of the word 
" think "-is to take one or more of these 
immobile views of its mobility. 
It consists, 
in short, in asking from time to time where 
the object is, in order that we may know 
what to do with it. 
Nothing could be more 
legitimate, moreover, than this method of 
procedure, so long as we are concerned only 
with 
a 
practical 
knowletlge 
of 
reality. 
Knowledge, in so far as it is directed to 
practical matters, has only to enumerate 
the principal possihle attitudes of the thing 
towards us, as well as our best possible 
attitude towards it. 
Therein lies the ordi­
nary function of ready-made concepts, thoHe 
1 stations with which we mark out the path 
of becoming. 
But to seek to penetrate with 
them into the inmost nature of things, is 
to apply to the mobility of the real a 

Metaphysics 
55 
method created in order to give stationary 
points of observation on it. 
It is to forget 
that, if metaphysic is possible, it can only 
be a laborious, and even painful, effort to 
remount the natural slope of the work of 
thought, in order to place oneself directly, 
by a kind of intellectual expansion, within 
the thing studied : in short, a passage from 
reality to concepts and no longer from con­
cepts to reality. 
Is it astonishing that, like 
children trying to catch smoke by closing 
their hands, philosophers so often see the 
object they would grasp fly before them? 
It is in this way that many of the quarrels 
between the schools are perpetuated, each 
of them reproaching the others with having 
allowed the real to slip away. 
,.. 
f' But if metaphysics is to proceed by in­
)uition, if intuition has the mobility of 
duration as its object, and if duration is 
of a psychical nature, shall we not be con·

contemplation of himself?

To talk in this way 
would be to return to the error which, since 
the beginning of this study, we have not 
ceased to point out. 
It would be to mis­
conceive the singular nature of duration, 
and at the same time the essentiall."V active, 
I might almost say violent, character of 
metaphysical intuition. 
It would he fail­
ing to se that the method we speak of 
alone permits us to go beyond idealism , 
as well as realism, to affirm the existence 
of objects inferior and superior ( though in 
a certain sem7e interior) to us, to make 
them co-exist together without difficulty, 
and to dissipate gradually the ohscuri tie8 
that analysis accumulates round these great 
problems. 
Without entering here upon the 
study of these different points, let us con­
fine ourselves to showing how the int nit ion 
we speak of is not a single act, but an in­
definite series of acts, all doubtless of the

species, and bow 
this diversity 
of acts 
corresponds to all the degrees of being. 
If I sek to analyze duration-that is, to 
resolve it into ready-made concepts-! am 
compelled, by the Vt>ry nature of the con­
cepts and of analysis, to take two opposing 
views of duration. in general, with which 
I then attempt to reconstruct it. 
This com­

a diversity of degrees nor a variety of forms ; 
like all miracles, it is or it is not. 
I shall 
have to say, for example, that there is on 
the one hand a multiplicity of ŝou<"cessive 
states of consciousneŞos, and on thf' other a 
unity which binds them together. 
Duration 
will be the " sś-ntheşois " of this unity and 
this multiplicity, a 
mysterious operation 
which takes place in darkness, and in re­
gard to which, I rt:'peat , one does not Nt'e 
bow it would admit of shades or of degrees. 

58 
An Introduction to 
In this hypotheis there is, and can only 
be, one single duration, that in which our 
own consciousnes habitually works. 
To 
expres it 
more 
clearly-if we 
coll8ider 
duration onder the simple aspect of a move­
ment accomplishing itself in space, and we 
Mek to reduce to concepts movement con­
sidered BH representative of time, we shall 
have, on the one hand, as great a number 
of points on the trajectory as we may de­
Hire, and, on the other hand, an abstract 
unity which holds them together as a thread 
holds together the pearls of a necklace. 
Be­
tween this abstract multiplicity and this 
ahMtract unity, the combination, when once 
it haK ben posited as possible, is something 
unique, which will no more admit of shades 
than does the addition of given numbers in 
arithmetic. 
But if, instead of professing to 
analyze duration (i. e., at bottom, to make 
a AynthesiK of it with concepts ) ,  we at once 
place ourÉeJves in it by an effort of intu­
Ition, we have the feeling of a certain very 
determinate tension, in which the determina-

Metaphysics 
59 
tion itl!elf appears as a choice between an 
infinity of possible durations. 
Hencefor­
ward we can picture to ourselves as many 
durations as we wish, all very different 
from each other, although each of them, on 
being reduced to concepts-that is, observed 
externally from two opposing points of view 
-always comes in the end to the same in­
definable combination of the many and the 
one. 
Let us express the same idea with more 
precision. 
If 
I consider duration as a 
multiplicity of moments bound to each 
other by a unity which goes through them 
like a thread, then, however short the chosen 
duration may be, these moments are un­
limited in number. 
I can suppose them as 
close together as I please ; there will always 
be between these mathematical points other 
mathematical points, and so on to infinity. 
Loked at from the point of view of multi­
plicity, then, duration disintegrates into a 
powder of moments, none of which endure8, 
each being an i.nartantaneity. 
If, on the 

6o 
An Introduction to 
other hand, I consider 
the 
unity which 
binds the moments together, this cannot 
endure either, since by hypothesis every­
thing that is changing, and everything that 
is reallá· durable in the duration, bas ben 
put to the account of the multiplicity of 
moments. 
As I probe more deeply into its 
es.ânce, this unity ";n appear to me as some 
immobile ãubstratnm of that which is mov­
ing, as some in temporal esence of time ; it 
iä this that I ãhall call eternity ;  an eter­
nity of death, since it is nnthing elMe than 
the movemPnt emptied of the mobility which 
made its life.

Othe1'8, on the contrary, set up the unity of

duration as concrete reality. 
They place 
._ 
themselves in the eternal. 
But as their 
eternity remains, notwithstanding, abstract, 
since it is empty, being the eternity of a 
concept which, by hypothesis, excludes from 
itself the opposing concept, one does not 
see how this eternity would permit of an 
indefinite number of moments coexisting in 
it. 
In the first hypothesis we have a world 
-
... 
resting on nothing, which must end and 
begin again of its own accord at each in­
stant. 
In the se˝nd we have an infinity 
of abstract eternity, about which also it 
is just as difficult to understand why it does 
not remain enveloped in itself and how it 
./ 
allows things to coexist with it. 
But ig. 
both cases, iand whichever of the two meta­
_;.J 
physics it be that one is switched into;, time 
... 
appears, from the psychological point of 
view, as a mixture of two abstractions, 
which admit of neither degrees nor shades. 
In one system as in the other, there is only 
one unique duration, which carries every-

An Introduction to 
thing with it-a bottomless, hankless river, 
wh ich flows wit hout assignable force in a 
direction which could not. be defined. ,. Even 
then we can call it only a river, and the 
river only flows, 
because 
reality obtains 
from 
the two 
tloctrines 
this concession, 
profiting by a moment of perplexity in their 
logic. 
As Roon as t hey recover from this 
perplexity, they freeze this flux either into 
an immense solid sheet, or into an in­
finity of crystallized needles, always into a 
thing which 
necerumrily partakes of the 
immobility of a point of view. 
It is quite otherwise if we place our­
selves from the first, by an effort of intu­
ition, in 
the concrete 
flow of duration. 
Certainly, 
we shall then find no logical 
reaȰoon for posit.ing multiple and diverse 
durations. 
Strictly, there might well be 
no other duration than our own, as, for 
example, there might be no other color iii 
the worltl but orange. 
But just as a con­
sciommess 
based 
on 
color, 
which 
sym­
pathized internally with OJ•ange instead or 

Metaphysics 
percetvmg it externally, would feel itself 
held between red and yellow, would even 
perhaps suspect beyond this laBt color a 
romplete spectrum into which the conti­
nuity from red to yellow might expand 
naturally, so the intuition of our duration, 
far from leaving us suspended in the void 
as pore analysis would do, brings us into 
contact with a whole conŗinuity of dura­
tions which we must try to follow, whether 
downwards or upwards ; in both cases we 
can extend ourselves indefinitely by an in­
creasingly violent effort, in both cases we 
transcend ourselves. 
In the 1lnt we ad­
vance towards a more and more attenu­
ated duration, 
the pulsations 
of which, 
being rapider than ours, and dividing our 
simple sensation, dilute its quality into 
quantity ; at the limit would be pure homO­
geneity, that pure repetition by which we 
define materiality. 
Advancing in the other 
direction, we approach a duration which 
strains, 
contracts, 
and 
intensifies 
itself 
more and more ; at the limit would be

which is an eternity of death, but an eter­

A living, and therefore still

duration would be included as the vibra·

he the concentration of all duration, as 
materiality is its dispersion. Between these 
two extreme limits intuition moves, ami

The consciousness 
we have of our own self in its continual tlux 
introduces us to the interior of a reality, 
on the model of which we must represent 
other realities. 
All 1·eality, therefore, is 
tendenc,1, if we agree to mean by tendency 
an incipient change of direction. 
III. 
Our mind, which seks for solid 
points of support, has for its main func­
tion in the ordinary course of life that of 
representing states and things. 
It takes, 
at 
long 
intervals, 
almost 
instantaneous 
views of the undivided mobility of the real. 
It thus obtains sensations ancl ideas. 
In 
this way it substitutes for the continuous 
the discontinuous, for motion stability, for 

66 
An Introduction to 
tendency in process of change, fixed points 
marking a direction of change and ten­
dency. 
This substitution is necessary to 
&,mmon-Rense, to language, to practical 
life, and ewn, in a certain degree, which 
we shall endeavor to determine, to posi­
tive science. 
Our intellect, when it follows 
Us natural bent, proceeds on the one hmzd 
by solid pe1·ceptions, and on the other by 
stable conceptions. 
It starts from the im­
mobile, and only conceives and expressefl 
movement as a function of immobility. 
It 
takes up its position in ready-made con­
cepts, and endeavors to catch in them, 
as in a net, something of the reality 
whkh passes. 
This is certainly not done 
in order to obtain an internal 
physical 
knowledge 
of 
the

and meta­

real, each 
concept (as also each sensation ) being a 
practical question which our activity puts 
to reality and to which reality rE'plies, as 
mmt he done in bminess, by a Yes or 
a No. 
But, in doing that, it lets that 

Metaphysics 
which is its very essence escape from the 
real.

the real, processes which we generally em­
P.Ś«?Y- . for practical ends. 
They arise from 
the fact that we place ourselves in the im­
mobile in order to lie in wait for the mov­
ing thing as it passes, instead of replacing 
ourselves in the moving thing itself, in 
order to traverse with it the immobile 
positions. 
They arise from our professing 
to reconstruct reality-which is tendency 
and consequeśtly mobility-with percepts 
and concepts whose function it is to make 
it stationary. 
With stoppages, however 
numerous they may be, we shall never make 
mobility ; whereas, if mobility is given, we 
can, by means of diminution, obtain from 

68 
An Introduction to 
it by thought as many stoppages as we de­
. sire. 
In other words, it is clear that ed 
concepts may be extracted by our thought 
from mobile reality; but there are 
no 
means of reconstructing the mobility of 
the real with fixed concepts. 
Dogmatism, 
however, in so far as it has ben aoUI.i.der 
of 
systems, 
has 
always 
attempted 
this 
reconstruction. 
V. 
In this it was bound to fail 
It is 
on this impotence and on this impotence 
only that the 
sceptical, 
idealist, critical 
doctrines really dwell : in fact, all doctrines 
that deny to our intelligence the power of 
attaining the absolute. 
But because we 
fail to reconstruct the living reality with 
stiff and ready-made concepts, it does not 
follow that we cannot grasp it in some other 
way. 
The demonstrations which haoe been 
given of the relativity of our kn 010ledge 
are therefore tai11ted 1dth an original vice; 
they imply, like the dogmatism they attack_. 
that all knowledge must necessarily start 
from concepts with jUed outline•, iA order 

Metaphysics 
to clasp with them the reality which 
flows. 
.. VI. But the truth is that our intelligence 
can follow the opposite method. 
It can 
place itself within the mobile reality, and 
adopt its ceaselessly changing direction ; in 
short, can grasp it by means of that intel­
lectual sympathy which we call intuition. 
This is extremely difficult. 
The mind haR 
to do violence to itself, has to reverse the 
direction of the operation by which it habitu­
ally thinks, has perpetually to revise, or 
rather to recast, all its categories. 
But in 
this way it will attain to fluid concepts, 
capable of following reality in all its sinu­
osities and of adopting the very movement 
of the inward life of things. 
Only thus 
will a progressive philosophy be built up, 
fred from the disputes which arise be­
tween the various 
schools, 
and able 
to 
solve its problems naturally, because it will 
be released from the artificial expression 
in 
terms 
of 
which 
such 
problems 
are 
posited. 
To philosophize, therefore, is to

Though mathematics is only the science of 
magnitudes, though mathematical processes 
are applicable only to quantities, it must 
not be forgotten that quantity is always 
quality in a nascent state ; it is, we might 
say, the limiting case of quality. 
It is 
natural, 
then, 
that 
metaphyHics 
should 
atlopt the generative idea of our mathe­
matics in rmler to extend it to all qualities ; 
that is, to reality in general. 
It will not, 
b· doing t his, in any way be moving to­
wards universal mathematics, that chimera

An Introduction to 
of modern philosophy. 
On the contrary, the 
farther it goes, the more untranslatable 
into symbols will be 
the 
objects it en­
counters. 
But it will at least have begun 
by getting into contact with the continuity 
and mobility of the real, just where this 
contact can be most marvelously utilized. 
It will have contemplated itself in a mirror 
which reflects an image of itself, much 
shrunken, no doubt, but for that reason 
very luminous. 
It 
will have 
seen 
with 
greater clearness what the mathematit·al 
processes borrow from concrete realit,v, and 
it will continue in the direction of com-rete 
reality, and not in that of mathematical 
processes. 
Having then discounted before­
hand what is too modest, and at the same 
time 
too 
ambitious, 
in 
the 
followinȮ 
formula, we may say that the objeet of 
metaphysics is to perform qualitative dif­
ferentiations and integrations. 
VIII. 
The reason why this object has 
ben lost sight of, and why science itself 
has ben mistaken in the origin of the pro-

Metaphysics 
73 
cesses it employs, is that intuition, once 
attained, must find a mode of expression 
and of application which conforms to the 
habits of our thought, and one which fur­
nishes us, in the shape of well-defined con­
cepts, with the solid points of support which 
we so greatly need. 
In that lies the con­
dition of what we call exactitude and pre­
cision, 
and 
also 
the 
condition 
of 
the 
unlimited extension of a general method to 
particular cases. 
Now this extension and 
this work of logical improvement can be 
continued 
for 
centuries, 
whilst 
the 
act 
:which creates the method lasts but for a 
moment. 
That is why we so often take the 
logical equipment of science for science it­
self/ forgetting the metaphysical intuition 
.rom which all the rest has sprung. -----
From the overlooking of this intuition 
proceeds all that has been said by phi­
losophers and by men of science themselves

An Introduction to 
about the " relativity " of scientific knowl­
edge. 
lVhat is relatine is 
the sym fwlic 
knowledge by pre-e:ristiny concepts, which 
proceeds frorn th e  fixed to the mot'ing, and 
not the intuitive knowledge trh irh insta ll. 
itself in that which ,is m oning a nd adoptR 
the very life of things. 
This intuition at­
tains the absolute. 
Science and metaphysics therefore come 
together in intuition. 
A truly intuitive 
philosophy would realize the m uch-detiin.•d 
union of science and metaphysics. 
V\'hile 
it would make of metaphyRics a pmlitive 
science-that is, a progt·essiw and indefi­
nitely perfectible one-it would at the same 
time lead the positive sciences, properly so­
l'alled, to hecome l'onscious of their true 
Hcope, often far greater than they imagine. 
It 
would 
put 
mm·e 
science 
into 
meta­
physics, noll more metaphysics into science. 
It would ret-mit in restoring the continuity 
between t ht' intuitions which tlw varionR 
seiences have obtained here and there in 
the cotmJc of their history, and whkil

IX. 
That there are not two different 
ways of knowing things fundamentally, that 
the 
various 
sciences 
have 
their root 
in 
metaphysics, is what the n_cie_!l_L_Ejl_o_s 
phers generally thought. 
Their error did 
not lie there. 
It consisted in their being 
always dominated by the belief, so natural 
to the human mind, that a variation can 
only be the expression and devPlopment of 
what is invariable. 
Whence it followed 
that action was an enfeebled contemplation, 
duration a deceptive and shifting image of 
immobile eternity, the Soul a fall from the 
Idea. 
The whole of the philosophy which 
begins with Plato and culminates in Ploti­
nus is the development of a principle which 
may be formulated thus : 
" There is more 
in the immutable than in the moving, and 
we pass from the stable to the unstable by 
a mere diminution." 
Now it is the contrary 
which is true. 
Modern science dates from the day when 

76 
An Introduction to 
mobility was eet up as an independent 
reality. 
It 
dates 
from 
the 
day 
when 
Galileo, setting a ball rolling down an in­
cline_'<.! plane, firmly resolved to tudy thiȭ 
mu\·ement from top to bottom for itself, in 
iteelf, instead of seking its prindple in 
the concepts of high and lotr. 
two 
im­
mobilit ies by which Aristotle believed he 
could adequately explain the mobility. Ami 
this is not an isolated fact in the history 
of science. 
Several of the great rliscoveri{'H, 
of those at least which have transformecl 
the positive sciences or which have created 
new ones, have been so many soundingȯ; 
in the depths of pure duration. 
The mo1-e 
living the reality touched, the deeper was 
the sounding. 
But the lead-line sunk to the sea bottom 
brings up a fluid mass which the sun's heat 
quickly dries into solid and discontinuouH 
grains of sand. 
And the _!11tuition _QLdura­
 when it is exposed to the rays o_f _the_ 
understanding, in like manner quickly t_l!_rns 
into tlxed, distinct, and immobile concepts. 

Metaphysics 
77 
In the living mobility of things the un· 
derstanding is bent on marking real or 
virtual stations, it notes departures and 
arrivals ; for this is all that concerns the 
thought of man in so far as it is simply 
human. 
It is more than human to grasp 
what is happening in the interval. 
But 
philosophy can only he an effort to tran­
scend the human condition. 
Men of science have fixed their attention 
mainly on the concepts with which they 
have marked out the pathway of intuition. 
The more they laid stress on these residual 
products, which have turned into symbols, 
the more they attributed a symbolic char­
acter to every kind of science. 
And the 
more they believed in the symbolic char­
acter of science, the more did they indeed 
make science symbolical. 
Gradually they 
have blotted out all difference, in positive 
science, between the natural and the arti­
ficial, between the data of immediate intu­
ition, and the enormous work of analysis 
which 
the 
understanding 
pursues 
round 

78 
An Introduction to 
intuition. 
Thus they have prepared the way 
for a doctrine which affirms the relativity 
of all our knowledge. 
But metaphysics has also labored to the 
Harne end . 
.How could the masters of modern philoso­
phy, who have been renovators of science 
as well as of metaphysics, have had no sense 
of the moving continuity of reality? 
How 
could they have abstained 
from placing 
themsel ves in what we call concrete dura­
tion '? 
They have <lone so to a greater ex­
tent than they were aware ; above all, much 
more than they sai<l. 
If we endeavor to 
link together, by a continuous connection, 
the intuitions about which systems have 
become organize<l, we find, together with 
other convergent an<l divergent lines, one 
very determinate direction of thought and 
of feeling. 
What is this latent thought? 
How shall we express 
the 
feeling? 
To 
borrow 
once more the 
language of the 
Platonists, 
we 
will 
say-depriving 
the 
words of their psychological sense, and giv-

ing the name of Idea to a certain settling 
down into easy intelligibility, and that of 
Soul to a certain longing after the restless­
ness 
of 
life-that 
an 
invisible 
current 
causes modern philosophy to place the Soul 
above the Idea. 
It thus tends, like modŜrn 
science, and even more so than modern 
science, to advance in an opposite direc­
tion to ancient thought. 
But this metaphysics, like this science, 
has enfolded its deeper life in a rich tissue 
of symbols, forgetting something that, while 
science needs symbols for its analytical de­
velopment, the main object of metaphysics 
is to do away with symbols. 
Here, again, 
the understanding has pursued its work of 
fixing, dividing, and reconstructing. 
It has 
pursued this, it is true, under a rather dŝf-
. 
ferent form. 
Without insisting on a point 
which we propose to develop elsewhere, it 
is enough here to say thŞt the understand-
._. . .  
ing, whose function it is to operate on stable 
elements, may look for stability either in 
relations or in things. 
In so far as it workş

An Introduction to 
on concepts of relations, it culminates in 
scientific symbolism. 
In so far as it works 
on concepts of things, it culminates in 
metaphysical symbolism. But in both cases 
the arrangement comes from the under­
΍tanding. Hence, it would fain believe itself 
independent. Rather than recognize at once 
what it owes to an intuition of the depths 
of reality.Jt prefers exposing itself to the 
1langer that its whole work may he looked 
upon as nothing but an artificial arrange­
ment of symbols. So that if we were to bold 
on to the letter of what metaphysicians and 
Hcientists say, and also to the material 
aspect of what they do, we might believe 
that the metaphysicians have dug a deep 
tunnel beneath reality, that the scientista 
have thrown an elegant bridge over it, but 
that the moving stream of things passes 
between these two artificial constructions 
without touching them. 
One of the principal artifices of the 
Kantian criticism consisted in taking the 
metaphysician and the scientist literally, 

Metaphysics 
81 
forcing both metaphysics and science to the 
extreme limit of symbolism to which they 
could go, and to which, moreover, they make 
their way of their own accord as soon as 
the understanding claims an independence 
full of perils. 
Having once overlooked the 
ties that bind science and metaphysics to 
intellectual intuition, Kant has no difl· 
culty in showing that our science is wholly 
relative, and our metaphysics entirely artiǗ 
ficial. 
Since he has exaggerated the ind

of 
the 
understanding in

cases, 
since he 
has 
relieved 
both 
meta· 
physics and science of the intellectual in· 
tuition which served them as inward ballast, 
science with its relations presents to him 
no more than a film of form, and meta· 
physics, with its things, no more than a 
film of matter. 
Is it surprising that the 
first, 
then, 
reveals 
to him 
only 
frames 
packed within frames, and the second only 
phantoms chasing phantoms? 
He has Rtruck Rnch telling blows at our 
science and our metaphysic that they have

not even yet quite recovered from their 
bewilderment. 
Our mind would readily re­
sign itself to seeing in science a knowledge 
that is wholly relative, and in metaphysics a 
speculation that is entirely empty. It sems 
to us, even at this present date, that the 
Kantian 
criticism 
applies to all meta­
physicH and to all science. 
In reality, it 
applies more especially to the philosophy 
of the ancients, as also to the form-itself 
borrowed from the ancients-in which the 
moderns have most often left their thought. 
It 
is valid 
against 
a 
metaphysic 
which 
claims to give us a single and completed 
syΔott•m of thingΒc, against a science profess­
ing to be a sinylc flystem of relations ; in 
short, against a science and a metaphysic 
presenting themselvcΓc with the architec­
t ural simplicity of the Platonic theory of 
ideas 
or 
of a Greek 
temple.

ah;o our elementary logic, it is but too evi· 
dent that, like all the works of pure u nder· 
standing, 
it 
becomes 
artificial. 
And 
if 
science is wholly and entirt·lࢪ· a work of 
analysis or of conceptual repreRentation, 
if experience is only to ǚ;erve tht>J•ein as a

If 
we look carefully into the Critique of Pure 
Reason, we se that science for Kant did 
indeed mean this kind of universal mathe· 
maNe, aud metaphysics this practically un·

In tnt t h, the dream of 
a universal mathematic hࢩ itself but a sur­
vival of Platonif'm. 
Universal mathematic 
is what the world of ideas becomes when 
we suppose that the Idea consists in a 
relation or in a law, and no longer in a 
thing. 
Kant 1 
took this dream of a few 
modern philosophers for a reality ; more 
t han this, he 
believed 
that all scientific 
knowledge was only a clPtached fragment 
of, or rather a stepping-stone to, universal 
matltf:'matkR. 
Hem·e the main task of the 
Critique was to lay the foundation of this 
mathematic-that is, to determine what the 
intellect must be, and what the object, 
in 
order that 
an 
uninterrupted mathe­
mat ic may bind 
them together. 
And of 
necessity, if all possible experience can be 
made to enter thus into the rigid and al­
n•ady foruw1l framework of our understand·

harmony) because our understanding itself 
organizes nature, and finds itself again 
therein as in a mirror. 
Hence the possi· 
bility of science, which owes all its efficacy 
to its relativity, and the impossibility of 
metaphysics, since the latter finds nothing 
more to do than to parody with phantoms of 
things the work of conceptual arrangement 
which science practises seriously on rela­
tions. 
Briefly, the whole Critique of Pure 
Reason ends in establishing that Platonism, 
illegitimate if Ideas are things, becomes le­
gitimate if Ideas are relations, and that the 
ready-made idea, once brought down in thi11 
way from heaven to earth, is in fact, as Plato 
held, the common basis alike of thought and 
of nature. But the whole of the Critique of 
Pure Reason also rests on this postulate, 
that our in.tellect is incapable of anything 
but Platonizing-that is, of pouring all pos­
sible experience into pre-existing moulds. 
On this the whole question depends. 
It 
scientific knowledge is indeed what Kant 
supposed, then there is one simple science,

preformed and even preformulated in na· 
hue, as Aristotle believed ; great discov· 
eries, then, serve only to illuminate, point

logic, immanent in things, just as on the 
night of a fMe we light up one by one the 
rows 
of 
gas-jets 
which 
already 
outline 
the shape of some building. 
And if meta­
physical knowledge is really what Kant 
supposed, it is rerluced to a choice between 
two attitudes of the mind before all the 
great problems, both equally possible ; it¶ 
manifestations are so man;· arbitrary and 
always ephc:>meral choices between two solu­

But 
the truth is that modern science does not 
preRent thb nnilinear simplicity, nor does 
mode•·n 
metaphysics 
present 
these 
irre­
ducible oppositions. 
Modern science is neither one nor simple. 
It rests, I freely admit, on ideas which in 
the end. we find clear ; but these ideaR have 
gradually 
become clear through the use 

Metaphysics 
made of them ; they owe most of their clear· 
ness to the light which the facts, and the 
applications to which they led, have by 
reflection shed on them-the clearness of a 
concept being scarcely anything more at 
bottom than the certainty, at last obtained, 
of manipulating the concept profitably. 
At 
its origin, more than one of these concepts 
must have appeared obscure, not easily 
reconcilable with the concepts already ad· 
mitted into science, and indeed very near 
the border-line of absurdity. 
This means 
that science does not proceed by an orderly 
dovetailing together of concepts predestined 
to fit each other exactly. 
True and fruitful 
ideas are 80 many close contacts with cur· 
rents of reality, which dƋ not necessarily 
converge on the same point. 
However, the 
concepts in which they lodge themselves 
manage somehow, by rubbing oft' each other' It 
corners, to settle down well enough together. 
On the other hand, modern metaphysics 
is not made up of 801utions 80 radical that

we repeat, which is simple anu definite like

to the surface very different materials. 
It is

In conclusion, we may remark that there

nothing

in 
this

Every one of us has had occasion to ex­

Any one of 
us, for instance, who has attempted literary

ǋmpoaition, knows that when the subject 
bu ben studied at length, the materialM 
all collected, and the notes all made, some­
thing more is needed in order to set about 
the "·ork of composition itlf, and that is 
an often very painful effort to place our­
aelves directly at the heart of the subject, 
and to 8ek as deeply as possible an im· 
pulae, after which we need only let our­
selves go. 
This 
impulse, 
once 
received, 
atarts the mind on a path where it re­
dii!Covers all the information it had col­
lected, and a thousand other tit-tails besides ; 
it develops and analW·zes itNC.•lf into terms 
which could 
be enumeratoo indefinitely. 
The farther we go, the more terms we dis­

kind. 
What corresponds here to the docu­
-----
ments and notes of literary composition is 
the sum of observations and experience 
gathered together by positive science. 
For 
we do not obtain an intuition from reality 
-that is, an intellectual sympathy with the 
most intimate part of it-unless we have 
won its confidence by a long fellowshi 
with its superficial manifestations. 
And it 
is not merely a question of assimilating the 
most conapicuous facts ; so immense a mass 
of facts must be accumulated and fused to­
gether, that in this fusion all the precon­
ceived and premature ideas which observers 
may unwittingly have put into their ob­
servations will be certain to neutralize each 
other. 
In this way only can the bare ma­
teriality of the known facts be exposed to 
view. 
Even in the simple and privileged 
case which we have used as an example, 
even for the direct contact of the self with 
the self, the final effort of distinct intu­
