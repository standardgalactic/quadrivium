GOPATH and Code Organization
●
Go requires you to organize your code in a speciﬁc way. 
●
Go programmers typically keep all their Go code in a single workspace.
●
A workspace is nothing more than a directory in your ﬁle system whose path is stored in 
the environment variable called GOPATH.
●
On Windows , it's in %USERPROFILE%\go (For Example: c:\Users\ad\go)
●
On Mac & Linux, it's in: ~/go (For Example: /home/john/go)
●
You can print out the values of the environment variables by running the go env 
command.

Go Workspace (GOPATH)
The workspace directory (GOPATH) contains the following 3 subdirectories at its root:
●
src: contains the source ﬁles for your own or other downloaded packages. 
●
pkg: contains go package objects a.k.a. package archives. These are non-executable ﬁles 
or shared libraries ending in .a 
●
bin: contains compiled and executable Go programs. When you run go install on a 
program directory, Go will put the executable ﬁle under this folder
All examples in this course will be in GOPATH\src\master_go_programming 
(C:\Users\ad\go\src\master_go_programming)
