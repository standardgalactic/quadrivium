What you need to do 
for every question in 
Tort Law
How to use this book
Books in the Question and Answer series focus on the why of a good answer alongside 
the what, thereby helping you to build your question answering skills and technique.
This guide should not be used as a substitute for learning the material thoroughly, your 
textbook and your lecture notes. It is not a silver bullet. It will help you though to make 
the most out of what you have already learned when answering an exam or coursework 
question. Remember that the answers given here are not the only correct way of 
answering the question but serve to show you some good examples of how you could 
approach the question set.
Make sure that you refer regularly to your course syllabus, check which issues are 
covered (as well as to what extent they are covered) and whether they are usually 
examined with other topics. Remember that what is required in a good answer could 
change significantly with only a slight change in the wording of a question. Therefore, do 
not try to memorise the answers given here; instead use the answers and the other 
features to understand what goes into a good answer and why.
It is also important not to worry about trying to learn all of the case citations. These are 
listed in the answers for information purposes only. You are unlikely to be expected to 
include these in an exam. Tort is predominantly a case-based subject and so you would be 
using a lot of your time if you listed the citations every time. However, you should obviously 
just confirm this with your tutors. Citations for journal articles are slightly different. While, 
again, it is very unlikely that you will be expected to write the full details of articles, you 
should give some indication as to where they are from, such as the journal abbreviation and 
year.

xvi
What you need to do for every question in Tort Law
All torts have an inherent structure because of the elements which make up each tort. Use 
these elements to form the basis of your structure, particularly for problem questions. Deal 
with the first element and then move on to the next. The key is to spot how much weight 
you need to give each element, as questions are likely to focus on particular elements of 
the tort.
Tort also has a large amount of theory underpinning it and is influenced by certain 
principles. Make sure you learn these and always try to incorporate these into your answer. 
This is particularly beneficial when the question is an essay assessing the merits of an 
overall tort, or the component elements required by the courts for a particular tort, but even 
in problem questions it strengthens the advice you are giving someone and demonstrates 
the level of knowledge and understanding that you possess.

Negligence: Duty  
of care
How this topic may come up in exams
While negligence is examinable as a whole (see Chapter 5), the various individual 
components can be, and often are, examined separately as essays. Duty of care 
is particularly ripe for essay questions because of its complexity and differing 
components. There is also a large amount of policy considerations in the decisions, 
and within the law’s development, of which you should also be aware. The more 
restrictive duty situations of psychiatric injury and economic loss may form part of 
an overall examination of the duty concept, or they may be treated distinctly, so do 
check your particular module guides for that.

Before you begin
Acquaint yourself with the following components and key issues of this topic; and familiarise 
yourself with how you would structurally progress through them all, if necessary, when 
attempting to answer a question on this topic.
A printable version of this diagram is available from www.pearsoned.co.uk/lawexpressqa
Is there a precedent which deals with
the duty situation and injury in question?
Yes: Then covers
      the matter
No: Then no
  duty owed
Is there suﬃcient proximity
of relationship?
Are there issues as to an
omission, or the act being
committed by a third party?
Is there a public
authority involved?
Would it be fair, just and reasonable to
impose a duty of care in this scenario?
If not and the situation is novel then
apply the 3-stage test
Was the claimant a foreseeable victim
directly or as an identiﬁable member
of a class?

  Question 1
  Question 1
‘The concept of duty of care in negligence emerged towards the end of the eighteenth 
century, and is now so firmly rooted that there can be no doubt that actions in negligence 
must fail where a duty is not established.’ Witting, C. (2015) Street on Torts. Oxford: Oxford 
University Press, p.27
In light of this statement critically evaluate the role of the duty concept and the need for it to 
be so firmly rooted in the tort.
Answer plan
➜ Provide the historical context and background to the role of the duty concept, discussing 
whether it needs to be firmly rooted in the tort.
➜ Evaluate the role played by the duty concept, including how and why it was developed in the 
way it has been.
➜ Assess the impact of the concept in the modern law and the extent to which it meets the 
needs of the tort.
➜ Conclude whether the concept is needed or could have a less prominent application.

1  Negligence: Duty of care 
Answer
The issue to be determined is whether it is right that the duty concept is 
so firmly rooted in negligence or whether it could operate without reliance 
on the concept, relying instead on the other aspects of negligence to 
perform the current duty function. This is important, as establishing a 
duty is the first hurdle which a claimant must overcome; a failure to do 
so means that, notwithstanding their injury and principles of corrective 
justice,1 they will have no redress. It will be argued that while not always 
valued, the duty concept plays a useful function in seeking to achieve 
justice for those injured, while preventing punitive liability for those who 
are negligent.
While firmly rooted in the tort today, this has not always been the case 
and its importance has previously been questioned.2 Winfield (1934) 
argued that historically no case was in fact ever lost through the 
absence of a duty. He noted that the concept of duty was never raised 
in the cases from which the independent tort of negligence grew, 
and in those cases arising during its early development. Similarly 
Buckland (1935) saw the duty concept as merely a fifth wheel: he 
argued that the more rational explanation for cases is that, as in 
Roman law, there is a duty to everyone, which is then limited on the 
basis of other aspects of the tort. By insisting on the existence of a 
duty to succeed in an action, claimants today now lose claims on 
a basis which they would not have lost on historically. As such, in 
Buckland’s view the insistence on the need for a duty in all situations 
creates injustice. A good example of this can be seen in relation to 
negligently inflicted psychiatric injury where, even if all of the other 
elements of negligence are present, the duty concept has long been 
used as the basis for denying liability. However, if liability can be 
justifiably limited by other factors and the duty’s presence would not 
have mattered, then it is perhaps questionable how much injustice is 
caused. Arguably, using, say, remoteness to limit liability rather than 
duty was not any fairer.3 
The debate around shifting the focus away from duty received fresh 
impetus in D v East Berkshire Community Health NHS Trust 
[2005] 2 AC 373 with Lord Bingham stating that he would ‘welcome’ 
such a shift in focus so that breach of duty becomes the dividing line 
between success and failure.4 Lord Nicholls in the same case noted 
1 By including reference to 
this here you are showing 
your marker early on that you 
have an understanding of 
the underlying fundamental 
principles of tort and how they 
relate to the question.
4 The point here is for you to 
say that, notwithstanding the 
time lapse and the changes 
to the law since the above 
views were first aired, there 
is prominent, recent support. 
This will then strengthen any 
argument you may want to 
advance that the concept need 
not be so rooted in the law.
2 Due to the view I have of this 
issue, I am starting by dealing 
with the idea it should not be 
so rooted and we could do 
without the concept.
3 While you have advanced 
Buckland’s view, you still 
need to subject it to some 
critical evaluation – is there 
a link between the concept 
and injustice or would it exist 
anyway?

5
  Question 1
the argument is ‘not without attraction’. However, he noted that while 
such a move would work in the field of human rights, in other cases 
it would cause lengthy uncertainty until a new control mechanism is 
devised which recognises that liability is not dependent on foreseea-
bility. Therefore if remoteness would also potentially cause unfairness 
and breach is not yet set up to act as an adequate control mechanism 
to contain claims, the duty concept needs to remain rooted in the law.
Therefore, need to firmly root the duty concept in the law as a con-
trol mechanism grew in importance following Anns v Merton LBC 
[1978] AC 728. The test proposed there for establishing a duty was 
seen as expanding negligence into areas that the law had been 
reluctant for it to explore, particularly economic loss. Generally, 
claims have to fit within an existing precedent which has recognised 
a duty in that situation. This rejects arguments of corrective justice 
whereby a person should have redress for any injury suffered through 
a want of care. Although it could be argued that by performing this 
role it reflects the fact that the law should also be just towards 
defendants.
However, negligence cannot be completely rigid and it needs to 
expand into new situations, but the duty concept firmly dictates 
when, so as to keep the law within acceptable bounds.5 This role 
is reflected in the test for establishing a new duty situation. In 
Caparo v Dickman [1990] 2 AC 605 it was determined that the 
following factors would need to be present on the facts. First, it must 
be reasonably foreseeable that the particular claimant would suffer 
the particular type of loss which did in fact occur. The issue of the 
foreseeable claimant leads to the second factor, which is proximity. 
There must be a sufficient closeness between the parties in view of 
the type of loss which justifies imposing a duty. This, in turn, leads 
to the third element, which is that it is ‘fair, just and reasonable’ 
to impose the duty. The presence of the first two factors means it 
generally will be, but this element is also where public policy comes 
in. Even today this still leads to injustice being caused, as with 
psychiatric injury, although the judges, rather than talking specifically 
about policy, can use the policy to find that there was insufficient 
proximity or foreseeability.
The converse can also be said to be true though. The third element 
and the presence of policy can lead to justice for the defendants and 
5 This part of your answer is 
quite important. Naturally, if 
you are discussing duty of 
care, you need to discuss how 
it arises. You need to link, 
though, how it arises to the 
wider discussion about what 
the role is and how well the 
test for establishment performs 
the role given to the concept.

6
1  Negligence: Duty of care 
thus it reinforces the modern role of the concept. A good example of 
this would be Caparo, where the auditor’s negligence was argued 
to have caused the claimant to buy, first, a significant shareholding, 
and then the entire third-party company. The claim was rejected by 
Lord Bridge6 because to hold otherwise would result in an indeter-
minate amount of liability, owed to an indeterminate class of people 
for an indeterminate length of time. If a duty was owed to potential 
shareholders, or even shareholders in relation to publicly released 
information, there was nothing to stop banks and merchants supply-
ing credit to the company in reliance on the accounts having a claim. 
Therefore, for these reasons it was determined that it would not be 
fair, just and reasonable to impose what would have been a potentially 
crushing duty of care on the auditors.
In conclusion, notwithstanding the arguments that the duty concept 
serves no function, or simply duplicates a role which could be per-
formed by another aspect of negligence, as Winfield (1934) noted,7 it 
is so deeply entrenched in the law now that only legislation can erad-
icate it. This is even more the case today, and therefore the debate 
now really is purely academic in nature even though different juris-
dictions also provide a model as to how the law could operate without 
it.8 The modern approach utilises the concept as a way of balancing 
when liability can justifiably be imposed on the one hand with the 
need to ensure the potential liability is not too excessive on the other. 
Although, as the cases show, this may not always be satisfactorily 
achieved, depending on how strictly one adheres to corrective justice.
6 As the reasoning is from a 
specific judge, name him/her 
as this shows a greater level of 
knowledge and understanding 
of the case, and that you have 
read, learnt and understood 
the judge’s views.
7 Whereas normally you would 
not need the journal’s full 
name, where it is one from 
another jurisdiction it is worth 
stating it in full, because the 
marker may not be familiar 
with the abbreviated initials, 
unlike, say, LQR.
8 This is where you could still 
expand on a comparative 
evaluation if you have not 
chosen to include a paragraph 
in the main body on other 
jurisdictions. The benefit of 
doing this is that the quote 
suggests the concept is 
indispensable. Show how other 
jurisdictions get by without 
it. This will then tie in to your 
discussion of the history of 
English law from Buckland 
(1935) and Winfield (1934).

  Question 2
  Question 2
‘. . . the common law does not impose liability for what are called pure omissions.’ Per Lord 
Goff in Smith v Littlewoods Organisation Ltd [1987] AC 241 at 271.
Evaluate the justification for the distinction that the law makes between positive acts and 
omissions in the context of recognising a duty of care.
Answer plan
➜ Highlight the reasons for making the distinction between acts and omissions and consider 
the merit of this general position.
➜ Analyse the situations when a duty will arise for an omission and whether these can be 
justified in light of the rationale for the general position.
➜ Evaluate the merit of the alternative opinion given by Lord Mackay in Smith and whether this 
provides a more justifiable approach.
➜ Conclude by determining whether the general position is justified or whether reform is needed.

AC 1751 there is no obligation to warn someone that they were walking 
off a cliff edge because an important distinction is made by the law 
between positive acts and pure omissions when it comes to recog-
nising the existence of a duty of care. The issue within the question is 
whether this distinction has merit and thus the differing legal treatment 
is warranted. Having evaluated the rationale for the distinction it will 
be argued that the position is justified, particularly as the existence of 
limited exceptions ensure a fair balance between parties.
The basis for the distinction was set out in political, moral and eco-
nomic terms by Lord Hoffmann in Stovin v Wise [1996] AC 923. The 
political reason is that it is less invasive on one’s personal freedom 
to simply require them to take care when choosing to undertake a 
positive act than compelling them to take action in the first place. 
From a libertarian perspective it is difficult to disagree. However, it 
can be argued that compelling people to be proactive is necessary 
and justified in certain situations; although this is arguably the basis

  Question 2
for some of the limited exceptions to the rule which will be discussed 
below.2 
The moral reason is known as ‘the why pick on me argument’. As a 
duty could be imposed on an indeterminate class of people, the ques-
tion is why that one individual should be held liable for the omission, 
and not another. In the absence of other factors it is hard to explain 
why that person is accountable, whereas it is easy to justify why a duty 
should be owed for positive conduct. This is why mere foreseeability 
of harm, which may be quite obviously present, is insufficient for 
the duty to arise (Gorringe v Calderdale Metropolitan Borough 
Council [2004] UKHL 153). In Stovin, Lord Hoffmann explained that 
it is proximity between the parties that is necessary to warrant a duty 
being recognised.4 Where a person has undertaken to do something, 
or induced another to rely on them doing something, the moral reason 
can be overcome. The proximity makes the claimant more readily 
identifiable and limits the scope of the duty and so it is fair and just 
for the defendant to owe it.
The theory of efficient allocation of resources is the basis for the 
economic reason for distinguishing acts and omissions. Economic 
theory dictates that if the cost of performing an activity is passed on 
to others the market becomes distorted as the activity is now cheaper 
to perform. As a benefit is being gained from the activity, there is a 
justification in making it bear its own costs, including any potential 
liability costs of the activity. The activity becomes economically inef-
ficient to perform if compensation payments or increased insurance 
premiums for negligent performance have to be covered; so the activ-
ity should be performed more safely in order to avoid such additional 
costs. However, Lord Hoffmann noted that there was no equivalent 
justification for imposing a cost on someone who is not performing 
an activity for the benefit of another. As the reasoning is based on the 
benefit gained from performing the activity, it is clear why this position 
is correct in relation to omissions.5 
Notwithstanding these reasons underpinning the distinction with posi-
tive acts, a duty in relation to omissions is recognised in certain limited 
situations as set out by Lord Goff in Smith. The first is where ‘special 
circumstances’ exist warranting the duty’s imposition. This includes 
where the person failing to act has an assumption of responsibility 
2 You have a bit of a balance to 
strike. There is an argument 
for saying that, if you mention 
the point here, you should 
explain it more, but you need 
to bear in mind what part of 
your answer you are dealing 
with – the reasons for the 
general rule. If you go off into 
the exceptions you will lose the 
structure of your argument, 
so the safest thing to do is 
to raise the point and show 
that you will be discussing it 
in depth at some stage. You 
could give an example of such 
a situation here though.
3 You could use Smith itself for 
this point as Lord Hoffmann 
in Gorringe was endorsing 
Lord Goff in Smith. However, 
this point can was challenged 
subsequently in Mitchell as you 
can discuss later. By using a 
different case at this stage you 
can reinforce the validity of the 
principle and help explain why 
the argument in Mitchell was 
right to be rejected. Additionally, 
it is also good to use as, unlike 
Smith and Mitchell, it is an 
English authority.
4 Use this as an opportunity 
to highlight your broader 
knowledge of the duty 
concept and how it relates to 
this specific discussion.
5 This is obviously the 
justification for not having a 
duty for omissions. Naturally, 
if you disagree with the 
reasoning, explain that here.

10
1  Negligence: Duty of care 
towards the claimant, arising from a contract or fiduciary position,6 
such as in Stansbie v Troman [1948] 2 KB 48.7 Where the harm is 
caused through the acts of a third party, a duty may also be imposed 
if there is a special relationship between the maker of the omission 
and that third party, as was the case in Dorset Yacht Club v Home 
Office [1970] AC 1004. Crucially, there is a clear element of proximity 
in both situations. This proximity overcomes the moral objection by 
indicating why the individual is being chosen to owe the duty; and 
the political reason for not recognising the duty is also overcome as 
proximity explains why it is fair for that individual to be required to act.
Lord Goff also highlighted two general circumstances when a duty 
may be imposed. First, when someone causes, or allows to be cre-
ated, a source of danger and it is reasonably foreseeable that a third 
party will interfere and bring the danger to life. Second, where an 
occupier has knowledge that a third party has created a fire, or the 
risk of one, on their premises and fails to prevent the fire spreading to 
neighbouring land. These exception were justified, as Lord Hoffmann 
explained in Stovin, as a mutuality of benefit exists in both situations 
which creates enough proximity to overcome the objections for impos-
ing a duty for an omission.
The general position in relation to omissions, as set out by Lord Goff 
in Smith, was challenged in Mitchell v Glasgow CC [2009] UKHL 
11. A submission was made to endorse the opinion of Lord Mackay 
in Smith who appeared to recognise a notional duty of care for 
omissions having expressly rejected the argument that there were 
policy grounds against recognising a duty. 8 As Markesinis (1989) 
argued in the LQR,9 while Lord Mackay referred to foreseeability, he 
also stressed that it fell to be decided on the facts of each specific 
case. This view can be equated with the idea of likelihood of harm 
when determining the standard of care to be exercised. Deciding the 
case on this basis, Lord MacKay held there was no breach of duty on 
the particular facts as opposed to any general principle against there 
being a duty in the first place. It could be that Lord Mackay felt, again 
in contrast to Lord Goff, that the situation was within the scope of the 
limited exceptions noted above. However, as Lord Mackay gave no 
detailed explanation for rejecting the strong policy reasons against 
recognising a duty, his opinion is weakened and their Lordships in 
Mitchell were correct to follow the general position of no duty for 
6 This firmly sets out when 
this situation would arise.
7 This is just to give a firmer 
example of the situation 
and so the facts are not 
necessary; your marker 
should know the facts of the 
examples that you give in this 
section of your answer, so 
you do not have to use time 
explaining them. If you are 
doing fine for time, you could 
give some brief phrases, 
such as ‘where a contracted 
decorator left the house 
unlocked’.
8 As there was a difference 
of opinion in Smith, and the 
traditional view of the general 
position was challenged, you 
should explore this discussion 
as it will allow you to develop 
your answer and add depth. As 
well as showing wider and more 
rounded knowledge you can 
demonstrate critical thinking by 
exploring whether the general 
position should be altered 
or whether there is a better 
explanation for the operation 
of the law’s approach to pure 
omissions. This also ensures 
that you are fully exploring 
whether the law is justified as 
required by the question.

the full citation and title but 
you should give the marker 
some reference point as this 
enables him/her to check it 
and adds to the validity of the 
reference.

  Question 2
Make your answer stand out
■ Draw on cases involving public authorities, particularly the police, such as Smith v 
Chief Constable of Sussex [2008] UKHL 50, to see whether a further exception should 
be recognised or whether a distinction needs to be made between public and private 
tortfeasors.
■ Explore in more depth whether the approach which Lord Mackay appeared to adopt has 
more merit than the general position and whether the reason for rejecting it in Mitchell 
was overly based on the facts of that case.
■ Read Markesinis, B. S. (1989) Negligence, nuisance and affirmative duties of action. 
Law Quarterly Review, 105: 104, and refer to this in support of your arguments. You can 
then use the article to undertake a comparative evaluation from the jurisdictions which 
are covered in the article.
omissions as espoused by Lord Goff, particularly in light of other 
subsequent cases following Lord Goff.10 
In conclusion, the law is right to treat pure omissions differently to 
positive acts when it comes to the imposition of a duty of care. To rec-
ognise a general duty in relation to omissions would be a significant 
intrusion on one’s personal autonomy which can be objected to on 
several, diverse grounds.11 Any potential unfairness deriving from this 
position is catered for through the creation of limited exceptions which 
can be applied when warranted by the facts of a case. This resultant 
flexibility maintains fairness between the parties and achieves justice 
whilst maintaining the overall justified position.
10 After raising the issue you 
need to express an opinion 
as to which view is better and 
why, otherwise it makes the 
discussion rather redundant 
and could negatively impact 
on your structure.
11 This is a reference to the 
political, moral and economic 
reasons for the general 
position that were discussed 
earlier in the answer. The aim 
here is to link back to them 
and emphasise that there are 
several distinct reasons for 
the general position which, 
therefore, makes the position 
stronger.

Negligence: Duty  
of care for 
economic loss
How this topic may come up in exams
The law restricts when a duty of care arises in negligence for purely economic losses. 
This area can come up as a distinct question, independent from a more general 
negligence one, or within the sole examination of negligence. In this chapter we look 
at common essay questions only, for which you will need to know about the policy 
factors behind the law’s restrictive approach. The topic is equally liable, though, to 
appear as a problem question dealing with either form of economic loss (i.e. resulting 
from negligent misstatements or negligent acts) or both (see Chapter 5). As such, 
you will need to learn the whole area, alongside the other components of negligence.

2  Negligence: Duty of care for economic loss 
Answer
The proposition within the quote which needs analysing is whether 
the assumption of responsibility test, deriving from Hedley Byrne 
& Co. Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd [1964] AC 465, is appropriate to 
use when determining if a duty of care for negligent misstatements 
arises. This is important as the law is restrictive in this field on policy 
grounds and any vagueness in the requirements could have severe 
implications for claimants and defendants. In assessing this test and 
the main alternative, the Caparo test, it will be argued that both can 
in fact work well together to appropriately deal with the matter.
The basis of the test is that the statement maker assumes 
responsibility towards the claimant, who then reasonably relies on 
the statement resulting in their loss. It applies regardless of the 
presence of a contractual or fiduciary relationship between the parties. 
The circumstances are said to be equivalent to a contractual situation, 
though lacking consideration.1 As such, the relationship between the 
parties is viewed as ‘special’, which creates enough proximity to 
overcome the policy objections to such actions and thus justifies a 
duty being imposed.2 As the claimants in Hedley Byrne had directly 
asked (albeit through their own bank) for the credit reference from 
the defendants, imposing the duty was easy to justify. While there 
was no contract for its provision, it was reasonable for the defendants 
to have anticipated reliance on the reference as the reason for the 
request was made clear. Therefore, by supplying it, the defendants 
had assumed responsibility towards the claimant in light of this 
reasonable reliance.3 The idea that responsibility had been assumed 
is supported by the directness of the request and so the merit of the 
test can be seen. The notion neatly fits the factual situation without 
leading to indeterminate liability which was part of the reluctance to 
find such a duty previously.4
Subsequently, the test has been developed to cover negligently 
provided services5 (Spring v Guardian Assurance plc [1995] 2 AC 
296). Lord Goff felt that the test’s correct basis is that the defendant 
has been trusted by the claimant to conduct their affairs. In Spring 
the issue concerned a job reference which was provided negligently. 
The direct relationship between both parties meant extending the test 
had merit. However, its continued development has caused doubts 
1 To fully explain the point 
you need to offer a little 
explanation here as to why 
it occurs outside of these 
situations.
2 By including this line by way 
of explanation, you indicate 
that you are aware that there 
are policy reasons behind the 
law and that it is only because 
of special circumstances that 
the law recognises a duty, 
without having to necessarily 
get into too much depth as to 
why. Remember the thrust of 
the question is on the merits 
of the particular test and not 
the merits of imposing a duty 
generally.
3 Adding any further facts from 
the case is not really going to 
add anything to your answer. 
What effectively you need to 
demonstrate through the facts 
is how the test operates and 
why it can be justified.
4 By rounding off the paragraph 
with this line you further 
acknowledge the key policy 
concern which Lord Devlin 
discussed in Hedley Byrne.
5 It is important to move your 
answer on into a discussion 
on this issue as it is the 
expansion of the test to new 
scenarios which is arguably 
the cause of the problems 
which the test faces and why 
it is criticised. Therefore, you 
can really start to engage with 
the question.

17
  Question 1
and criticism. In Henderson v Merrett Syndicates [1995] 2 AC 
145, there was less reliance and what there was, was more indirect: 
A had contracted with B to perform a service for the benefit of C 
knowing that it was for C’s benefit. Arguably, the application still had 
merit as A knew that C was benefiting from the service and this 
justified the idea that A had assumed responsibility towards C. Again, 
Lord Goff argued that any criticisms of the test arose in order to 
prevent the scope of liability extending to an indeterminate class, but 
this was not an issue in Henderson as the knowledge and reliance 
created an identifiable and determinate class.
Therefore, the test seems to clearly require a directness between the 
parties or at least sufficient knowledge that the statement/service is 
being relied on by an identifiable class. The resultant proximity which 
this causes warrants the duty of care. However, the application of 
the test has not stuck to these situations and has been developed to 
be used when a contract between A and B exists for the benefit of 
C, which C does not know about.6 This situation occurred in White 
v Jones [1995] 2 AC 207, where the intended beneficiaries of a 
will received nothing following the negligent failure to redraft it as 
instructed. Lord Browne-Wilkinson suggested that the phrase referred 
to the task to be performed, not the legal obligation. As the defendant 
had involved himself in the claimant’s affairs, the case was aligned 
with previous ones justifying a duty. Lord Mustill, dissenting, argued 
though that for an assumption of responsibility to exist mutuality was 
needed between the parties so that both played an active role in the 
transaction in question. Such mutuality was present in all of the cases 
following Hedley Byrne, including Henderson as, effectively, C had 
engaged B to contract with A; however, it was clearly lacking in White.
Lord Mustill’s view built on that of Lord Griffiths’ opinion in Smith v 
Eric S. Bush [1990] 1 AC 831, who felt the phrase only has any real 
meaning if assumption of responsibility refers to assuming responsi-
bility towards the person who acts upon the advice. This was because, 
if asked, the maker of the statement would only consider himself to 
be assuming legal responsibility for the person they contracted with. 
This view has force due to its logic; and if correct, applying the test 
to situations such as Smith and White cannot be right. In any event, 
the lack of clear consensus as to the phrase’s meaning and how the 
test operates raises a question mark over its suitability to determine 
liability.7
6 It is important to consider 
the development of the test 
in distinct stages because 
this will allow you to consider 
the merits of the test through 
each development and 
discuss whether it has merit 
in all of the new situations, 
none or just particular ones.
7 By having a distinct 
paragraph on the criticisms 
of the assumption of 
responsibility test you reach 
the culmination of your 
discussion on it and provide 
a platform to then go on and 
cleanly assess the test’s 
alternative, the Caparo test, 
which is the logical next step 
in the answer.

18
2  Negligence: Duty of care for economic loss 
In Smith, applying what has become known as the Caparo test was 
preferred. This test requires the claimant and the injury suffered to 
be foreseeable, proximity between the parties and imposing a duty 
to be fair, just and reasonable.8 Applying the Caparo test in certain 
situations may have more logic, and thus more merit. However, the 
judiciary has acknowledged that this test too does not always provide 
the answer. In Customs and Excise Commissioners v Barclays 
Bank plc [2007] 1 AC 181 Lord Walker commented that it merely 
provides ‘a set of fairly blunt tools’,9 with the other judges express-
ing similar sentiments. Indeed, even in Caparo, both Lords Bridge 
and Roskill10 highlighted how the three requirements lacked enough 
precision to be an effective practical test and were, at most, labels 
describing situations where a duty has been held to exist. This vague-
ness though does have some merit in that it allows judges scope to 
look at the entire circumstances in light of any prevailing policy and 
determine the matter.11 Ultimately though, criticisms can be levelled 
at, and questions raised over, both tests equally.
In conclusion, this leaves two tests which can be used, and questions 
regarding which should be used and when.12 The test has merit as 
a mechanism for establishing the sufficient proximity between the 
parties, which makes it in turn just to impose a duty and, as such, 
it is simply a means of satisfying the Caparo requirements. As Lord 
8 Clearly, you will need to 
outline what the test involves 
but the actual issue of the 
question does not make it 
essential to break down these 
in depth. You could perhaps 
do this to make your answer 
stand out more.
9 By highlighting a specific 
quote here you add substance 
to the general assertion that 
you are making.
10 Whereas Lord Bridge’s 
opinion is the most well-known 
from the case, by including 
reference to Lord Roskill you 
first show a wider and deeper 
level of knowledge of the case, 
and secondly strengthen the 
assertion that you are making 
about the limits of the test 
by showing it was more of a 
widely held view.
11 Although you have just 
highlighted some problems 
with the Caparo test, remember 
the point of the question and 
see if this test has any merit 
which might make it better than 
the assumption of responsibility 
test.
12 This allows you to conclude 
your answer by pulling the 
arguments for and against 
each test together. Your aim 
should be to consider the 
extent to which the two tests 
can work together in a sensible 
and coherent manner. If you 
feel they cannot, you should 
advance this and suggest what 
you feel needs to be done to 
improve the state of the law. 
If you feel they can, you need 
to show how this is so.

19
  Question 1
Bingham noted in Customs and Excise Commissioners,13 the 
outcomes in past cases were likely to have been the same which-
ever test was used. Consequently the tests are compatible with equal 
merit and effectiveness, although, each has a more appropriate realm 
of application. Therefore, the approach advocated by Lord Bingham 
is the best one; namely the whole circumstances of the case are 
viewed in light of policy considerations, and then the assumption of 
responsibility test is used as the starting point. If needed, Caparo is 
then applied.
13 When you abbreviate a case 
make sure you have written 
the name in full first and then 
use an appropriate name 
which still identifies the case 
in question. Avoid shortening 
the case name to that of 
the bank due to the number 
of cases involving each 
bank. The marker may not 
necessarily know what case 
you mean otherwise.

  Question 2
Answer
The issue raised by the quote is what test should be used when 
deciding when a duty will be owed for negligent misstatement causing 
purely economic loss. While recoverable, such losses are dealt with 
more restrictively than personal or property injuries. This is contro-
versial as a person suffering significant financial damage may be 
left without redress even though all other aspects of negligence are 
satisfied. Therefore, the basis of liability needs clarity and certainty, 
and to be based on sound principle.1 By having seemingly different 
tests, without explanation of their relationship, the law has lacked 
these qualities and has risked causing injustice if each test reaches 
a different result, or undermining itself if each is stretched beyond its 
normal bounds to reach the same outcome as the other. However, it is 
submitted that the tests have now been reconciled and the law has a 
clear, consistent and just basis going forward.
No duty for such losses existed prior to Hedley Byrne & Co. Ltd v 
Heller & Partners Ltd [1964] AC 465. However, in recognising such 
a duty, the House of Lords stressed that it would be on a restrictive 
basis as the policy factors for previously denying a duty still had force. 
The concern is ensuring that the statement maker is not dispropor-
tionately, and unfairly, burdened with liability. This is legitimate as 
people can express definitive opinions in certain situations without 
considering the influence, due to the situation, that those words will 
have.2 Additionally, words can be quickly disseminated to a wider 
audience so that the people who ultimately suffer the loss may differ 
from those to whom the statement was made and whom the maker 
may not know. This may explain why the person may not have taken 
sufficient care initially when making the statement. As such, their 
Lordships held3 for a duty to be imposed what must be established 
is an assumption of responsibility by the defendant towards the 
claimant, which was reasonably relied on by the claimant, and the 
defendant knew that their skill and judgement was being relied on 
(the assumption of responsibility test). This worked in Hedley Byrne 
because the defendant bank knew that the credit worthiness rating 
was for the purpose of enabling the claimant to make a business 
decision,4 albeit liability was ultimately excluded.5
1 Show from the start that you 
understand the area fully; 
know what the debate is 
getting at; and what you are 
required to consider.
2 Whenever you are giving the 
rationale for a legal principle 
always ensure you evaluate its 
merit rather than simply state 
it, even if the question does 
not say to specifically evaluate 
that point, as you will still 
pick up marks and show you 
understand the law. In terms 
of this question, it is needed 
here to establish whether, 
regardless of what test is 
used, there is a sound basis 
for the law’s overall approach.
3 This may seemingly add 
nothing, but its purpose is 
to link what you are about 
to say back to the case that 
you have just discussed and 
highlight to your marker what 
the authority is for what you 
are saying without repeating 
the case.
4 Illustrate how the principle 
worked in the case to show 
your understanding of it. This 
can also help your answer 
avoid coming across as overly 
descriptive as to what the 
law is.
5 However, don’t forget this 
significant fact from the case. 
While the court recognised the 
duty, it did not find one on the 
facts. It is a good sign as to 
whether you have read, and 
properly understood, the case.

22
2  Negligence: Duty of care for economic loss 
Problems started to arise though as the test was expanded.6 It was 
first developed to apply to the negligent provision of services on 
the grounds that what underpins the test is the claimant entrusting the 
undertaking of their affairs to the defendant. When the parties have 
a direct relationship, this can be justified and overcome the policy 
concern noted above, but where the relationship is more indirect 
there are legitimate doubts. In Henderson v Merrett Syndicates 
[1995] 2 AC 145, A had contracted with B to perform a service for the 
benefit of C in the knowledge that it was for C’s benefit. That A knew 
that C was benefiting from the service created a sufficient closeness 
between the parties to justify the suggestion that A had assumed 
responsibility towards C and thus keep liability limited in scope.
The closeness of relationship in Henderson can be contrasted with 
White v Jones [1995] 2 AC 207 where a negligent failure to redraft 
a will meant the claimants inherited nothing. As the contract was with 
the deceased and the claimants would have had no knowledge of it, it 
is difficult to see an assumption of responsibility which, despite finding 
a duty, was recognised by Lord Goff. His Lordship felt practical justice 
required the assumption of responsibility to the deceased be extended 
to the claimant. Lord Browne-Wilkinson7 suggested that the phrase 
‘assumption of responsibility’ meant for the task performed, and not 
in relation to any legal obligation. There was a strong dissent by Lord 
Mustill8 who argued that for an assumption of responsibility to exists 
there needs to be mutuality between the parties from both playing an 
active role in the transaction. Lord Mustill argued that in previous cases 
this was the case as, at the very least, B had contracted with A at the 
instigation of C. Criticisms of the test predated its expansion and Lord 
Mustill’s dissent built on earlier criticisms of the test by Lord Griffiths 
6 While this expansion came 
after a period when the 
‘three-fold’ test from Caparo 
was in the ascendancy, it is 
worth dealing with how the 
original approach was taken 
in these expanded situations 
here, before looking at the 
latter test, as it is all part of 
how the original test operates. 
If you take a chronological 
approach your evaluation 
of the application of the 
assumption of responsibility 
test risks being disjointed.
7 Use his Lordship’s reasoning 
as well as it contrasts nicely 
with the criticisms made by 
Lords Mustill and Griffiths 
which you can flow onto 
neatly before setting out the 
three-fold test. Additionally, 
by using Lord Browne-
Wilkinson in addition to Lord 
Goff you also highlight the 
lack of agreement by the 
majority which strengthens 
the point that is ultimately 
being made.
8 Your aim in this section is to 
not only show the development 
of the assumption of 
responsibility test, but also 
to set a platform for the rest 
of your answer and link it 
back to the question. The 
statement shows there are 
different tests and implies 
judicial inconsistency and 
disagreement, which is what 
you are highlighting here. You 
can then use this to support 
why a second test was needed 
and then discuss that test, in 
that context.

23
  Question 2
in Smith v Eric S. Bush [1990] 1 AC 831.9 Lord Griffiths held that 
‘assumption of responsibility’ only has any real meaning if it refers 
to when the law deems the maker of a statement to have assumed 
responsibility towards the person who acted upon the advice, i.e. they 
had assumed a legal obligation to them. This highlights the lack of 
clarity as to what a key component of the test refers to.
Lord Griffiths had preferred what became known as the ‘three-fold’ 
test from Caparo. This test was a response to the perceived weak-
ness of the assumption of responsibility test and involves the claim-
ant demonstrating that their injury was foreseeable to the defendant; 
there was sufficient proximity between them and; overall, it is fair, just 
and reasonable to impose a duty. The judges in Caparo acknowl-
edged though that the test was limited and lacked precise definition.10 
Resultantly, it leaves a large degree of discretion in the courts’ hands. 
While inherent flexibility can be advantageous, it puts claimants firmly 
at risk of policy decisions denying their claim. Ultimately, this test 
could be said to have equal weaknesses as the assumption of respon-
sibility test in not providing certain application.11
Therefore, the situation was detrimental as two tests existed, each 
with limitations and no clear guidance as to which should be used 
and when. The position has since been resolved in Customs and 
Excise Commissioners, which made clear that an assumption of 
responsibility is simply a sufficient basis for finding a duty of care, but 
not necessary. Whether there has objectively been such an assump-
tion is simply a first question which, if answered negatively, calls 
for a consideration of the three-fold test. Lord Bingham noted both 
tests are compatible, although each has a more appropriate realm of 
application. An assumption of responsibility can objectively be said to 
exist where there is akin to a contractual relationship. More remote 
relationships may still warrant a duty, but based on the three-fold test 
which can give it a sounder basis. While the judges acknowledged 
there was no one single touchstone of liability, the case does at least 
provide certainty as to the interplay between the test and clarifies 
the process.12 Unnatural applications of the concept of assumption 
of responsibility, beyond when it can be said to realistically exist, are 
avoided. However, by then having recourse to the three-fold test, 
flexibility is provided in order to achieve a just outcome whilst allowing 
the law to develop into novel situations in a controlled manner.
9 What you are writing here 
naturally fits with your 
argument at this stage and 
placing this particular point 
at the end of the paragraph 
allows you to then go 
seamlessly into the Caparo 
test and the next part of your 
answer.
10 Highlight how the judges 
have acknowledged it is 
not perfect. This gives your 
evaluation of the merits of the 
test extra depth and allows 
you to substantiate your point 
with judicial support.
11 As you are discussing a 
different test and explaining 
that it came about in light 
of criticism of the previous 
test, you need to assess the 
merit of this test. Link it back 
to your earlier discussion by 
considering whether it deals 
with any of the problems you 
discussed in relation to the 
assumption of responsibility 
test.
12 Although you are about to 
go into your conclusion, do 
not wait to give a view on 
what the case decided and its 
impact on the law. It needs 
to be stated at the time you 
discuss the point to have 
more strength. The supporting 
basis for the proposition can 
be viewed in conjunction with 
it and thus it also helps to 
maintain a strong structure.

24
2  Negligence: Duty of care for economic loss 
In conclusion, the current position accommodates both tests in a log-
ical way while retaining the sound basis for finding duties restrictively. 
While there could still be some uncertainty to the law, it is in a much 
stronger position now.
Don’t be tempted to . . . 
■ Provide a full history of the duty concept even in relation to economic loss. Stick to a 
tight structure or you will risk running out of time.
■ Extensively cover the facts of each case. Demonstrate that you know what happened and 
give enough detail to enable you to comment on whether the development was justified, 
even only on the facts.
■ Get side-tracked by the issue of the injunction in Customs and Excise Commissioners v 
Barclays Bank plc [2007] 1 AC 181.
■ Discuss in any detail economic loss for negligent acts other than a brief comparative 
comment, as mentioned above, as that is distinct from the specific direction in the 
question.
■ Similarly go on to discuss the other elements of negligence, as the question is 
specifically on the duty aspect.
Make your answer stand out
■ Make sure that you have read Customs and Excise Commissioners v Barclays Bank plc 
[2007] 1 AC 181 and have a good understanding of the different judicial opinions within 
it. Draw on a variety of these to reinforce the points you are advancing as to the law’s 
operation.
■ Consider whether the tests are that dissimilar and the extent that cases could have been 
decided the same way using either test.
■ Demonstrate a wide range of academic opinion in your arguments by reading articles 
such as Stapleton, J. (1991) Duty of care and economic loss: a wider agenda. Law 
Quarterly Review, 107: 249; Murphy, J. (1996) Expectation losses, negligent omissions 
and the tortious duty of care. Cambridge Law Journal, 55(1): 43–55; and Hedley, 
S. (1995) Negligence – pure economic loss – goodbye privity, hello contorts. Cambridge 
Law Journal, 54(1): 27–30.
■ Consider economic loss from negligent acts briefly in order to make a wider statement 
as to the coherence of the overall law, and the judicial approaches taken to economic 
losses.

Negligence: Duty of 
care for psychiatric 
injury
How this topic may come up in exams
Psychiatric injury is an aspect of negligence concerned with mental harm which has 
been caused through the negligent act of another. However, it has its own specific 
criteria for establishing whether a duty of care is owed. For these reasons, it is a 
common exam question in its own right, separate and distinct from the more normal 
questions on negligence and physical injury. You must ensure that you are familiar 
with the different rules for establishing liability and the distinctions that the law 
makes between the different categories of individuals within a problem question (see 
Chapter 5). The law has also been heavily criticised, with various proposals offered 
regarding reform. This also makes this topic equally favourable with examiners as 
an essay question.

‘I cannot, for my part, regard the present state of the law as either entirely satisfactory or as 
logically defensible.’ (Per Lord Oliver in Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police 
[1992] 1 AC 310, 418)
Critically evaluate the reasoning and merits of the approach taken by the courts in relation to 
recognising a duty of care for negligently inflicted psychiatric injury.
Answer plan
➜ Define psychiatric injury.
➜ Explain the distinction between primary and secondary victims.
➜ Explain the different control mechanisms for secondary victims, assessing their justification 
and, therefore, whether the law is ‘satisfactory’ and can be defended logically.
➜ Explain some of the reform proposals and discuss whether they are better than the current law.
➜ Conclude by summarising what state the current law is in and whether any reform proposals 
will help.

Answer
Whether the law is ‘satisfactory or logically defensible’ matters as 
psychiatric injuries arguably are more devastating than physical ones 
and advancements in medical understanding require the law to keep 
up.1 Historically the law has taken a highly restrictive approach, based 
on issues of public policy, and put control mechanisms in place which

claimants must satisfy to succeed. A large numbers of claimants 
have failed to do so, leading to the area becoming very emotive. 
The different judicial approaches to different categories of victim will 
be assessed with the various control mechanisms evaluated in order 
to gauge their merit. It is argued that the sentiment expressed by Lord 
Oliver is justified and that reform is needed.2
It must first be considered what amounts to an actionable psychiatric 
injury. As Lord Denning noted in Hinz v Berry [1970] 1 All ER 1084, 
English law does not compensate for mere grief or sorrow; what is 
needed is a medically recognised psychiatric injury.3 Therefore, unlike 
physical injuries, a threshold of psychiatric harm is required. The 
rationale was highlighted by Lord Steyn in White v Chief Constable 
of South Yorkshire Police [1999] 2 AC 455: expensive expert wit-
nesses are required to establish the exact nature of the psychiatric 
injury. This has time and cost implications for the administration of 
justice. Although simple grief should not warrant liability, it is ques-
tionable whether this reasoning is applicable today as science is more 
able to quickly and definitively diagnose genuine conditions due to a 
better understanding of them.4
In determining whether a duty is owed, the law categorises people 
as either primary or secondary victims. While the Law Commission 
has called the distinction ‘more of a hindrance than a help’, it exists 
in order to limit those who could bring a claim.5 Primary victims must 
be exposed to a reasonably foreseeable risk of physical injury (Page 
v Smith [1996] 1 AC 155). Lord Lloyd in Page held that there was 
no justification in treating physical and psychiatric injury differently for 
such victims. Therefore, provided physical injury was foreseeable, the 
claimant would be successful even if psychiatric injury was not. This 
approach, while criticised, is acceptable6 as the claimant has been 
placed in direct danger. Everyone else is deemed a secondary victim 
and must be of ‘customary phlegm’ to succeed (Bourhill v Young 
[1943] AC 92). They then must satisfy the control mechanisms from 
Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [1992] 1 
AC 310 to succeed, which puts such victims in a far less favourable 
position than primary victims.
The control mechanisms are heavily influenced, and underpinned, by 
policy considerations which were explained by Lord Steyn in White.7 
Principally, the judiciary have applied the ‘floodgates’ argument and 
2 This indicates straight away 
that you are aware of the wider 
issues relating to this area 
and that something needs to 
replace the current law.
3 By referring to judicial 
comment you will demonstrate 
your authority for the statement 
and by referring to the actual 
judge add more authority to 
your answer by demonstrating 
more knowledge of the point 
you are making.
4 You should include this in 
order to weigh up the merits 
of the requirement in order to 
avoid being too descriptive. 
By referring to medical 
advancement you also tie 
your comment back to your 
introduction. It also allows you 
to develop the argument, if 
you agree, that the rationale 
of the law is based on an 
outdated understanding of 
these injuries.
5 State the justification for 
the distinction; although 
it is criticised by the Law 
Commission, it is important to 
state why it exists.
6 You will find a lot of criticism 
of this case in the textbooks. 
However, rather than simply 
adopt it, look at the judicial 
reasoning carefully and see 
what arguments you can 
advance in its favour. You will 
impress your marker with the 
originality of your thinking.
7 By setting out the policy 
justifications here you provide 
the context from which to 
assess the mechanisms.

31
  Question 1
sought to avoid a wide class of individuals being able to claim. This 
is then combined with the need to avoid imposing disproportionate 
liability, as the negligence may only have been a momentary lack of 
concentration. These factors can be justified on the basis of fairness 
to the defendant as psychiatric injury could be caused to a wider 
range of people from a single incident than those physically injured. 
The final consideration is that the prospect of compensation may act 
as a disincentive to recovery. Stapleton (1994a) explained that this is 
a well-intentioned desire to protect the claimant’s condition deteriorat-
ing through the stress of a trial; however, as Teff (1998) highlighted,8 
there is little evidence to support the assertion. As such, it is hard to 
sustain an approach based on this consideration.
The first control mechanism9 is a close tie of love and affection with 
an immediate victim of the incident. In Alcock it was held that there 
is a rebuttable presumption of such a tie between a parent and child, 
and spouses. The defendant should reasonably foresee injury to these 
groups, but not necessarily others such as siblings who must prove their 
closeness with evidence. This creates uncertainty and is more likely to 
cause deterioration in a claimant’s condition.10 Weir (1992)11 argued 
that this risks cause ‘embarrassment’ to claimants who face cross-ex-
amination on their closeness, and contradiction by investigators.
The second mechanism requires the claimant to be present at the 
incident. McLoughlin v O’Brien [1983] 1 AC 410 extended this tem-
porally forwards and spatially away from the scene to include the 
immediate aftermath, thus covering seeing the immediate victim in 
hospital. While McLoughlin eases some of the mechanism’s strict-
ness, it remains an arbitrary line drawn by the courts. In McLough-
lin, the claimant succeeded in arriving two hours later and seeing 
the unclean bodies, yet in Alcock relatives who arrived later, having 
travelled further, were unsuccessful.12 It is also questionable whether 
the result would have been the same if the bodies had been cleaned 
in McLoughlin. The issue is far from clear and, again, reinforces the 
proposition that the law is unsatisfactory.
The final mechanism is that the psychiatric injury was a result of 
directly perceiving the incident or aftermath with one’s own senses. 
While similar to the second mechanism, it requires the injury to arise 
from the sudden impact of witnessing the event rather than through 
gradual exposure. This can produce inconsistent results. No claim will 
8 In exams include citations 
of academic opinion as it 
strengthens the suggestion 
that you have read the texts 
and also helps the marker 
double-check what you are 
saying as they have an idea 
where the opinion is from. 
That said, save time by 
abbreviating the citation; if it 
is a book or article, as here, 
then just put the year.
9 The existence of the control 
mechanisms is really the 
key part of your answer and 
where you should focus your 
time. Ensure that what you 
write deals with the issue of 
whether they make the law 
satisfactory or not.
10 Try and relate your criticism 
of the mechanism back to 
the policy justifications for 
imposing mechanisms as this 
will give more force to the 
point you are making.
11 Try to vary your sources of 
academic opinion to illustrate 
your wider reading, rather 
than relying on the same 
academic.
12 By highlighting a different 
result in another case you 
reinforce the idea that the 
law is inconsistent and 
unsatisfactory.

32
3  Negligence: Duty of care for psychiatric injury
stand if the injury is caused immediately upon being informed, by a 
third party of, say, the death of a child. Lord Keith in Alcock explained 
the reason as being a lack of proximity and because English law has 
never allowed for recovery in this way.13 However, if the onset of injury 
is delayed until arrival at the mortuary in sufficient time, the claimants 
could succeed. This is hard to justify; if it is reasonably foreseeable that 
a parent would suffer injury as a result of witnessing an incident, surely 
it is a foreseeable occurrence from being informed of the incident.
There does seem to be judicial consensus around Lord Oliver’s view of 
the law with Lord Steyn in White opining that the law is a ‘patchwork 
quilt of distinctions’.14 This has led to widespread calls for reform, 
notably from the Law Commission. A significant aspect of the Com-
mission’s proposals was to remove the second and third mechanisms 
owing to the unjust results they can bring; the first mechanism would 
be retained in amended form. A conclusive, automatic statutory pre-
sumption of closeness was proposed for the existing groups, but 
widened to include siblings and cohabitants. Those not within the list 
could still have to prove their closeness as now. If adopted, the flood-
gates could still be avoided as there would still be a restrictive control, 
but it would operate in a more logically defensible way.
To conclude, it is submitted that the statement describes the law 
correctly. Reform is not only desirable, but a necessity in order to 
ensure justice for victims of negligence. The Commission’s proposals 
would vastly improve the situation while still maintaining the control 
required by policy.15
13 Again, as with the other 
paragraphs, it is important 
to balance the discussion by 
stating what the reason for 
the mechanism is first before 
you provide any criticism of it. 
If you personally feel that the 
mechanism is justified, write 
the reason after the criticism 
so that the answer reads 
more strongly.
14 By using a second judicial 
quote from another leading 
case, you build up the picture 
that the judiciary are not 
happy with the law even 
though they are applying it. 
Your argument, therefore, 
carries more weight and will 
lead in to a discussion as to 
reform.
15 Depending on the number 
of proposals that you discuss, 
ensure that you state which 
one you prefer to round off 
your discussion.
Make your answer stand out
■ Contrast the approach taken in respect of physical injuries and discuss in more depth 
whether such a distinction between types of injury is warranted.
■ Explore in more detail whether the law for primary victims is as equally unsatisfactory as 
that for secondary victims.
■ Expand on the options for reform. Although the question does not expressly ask for a discus-
sion regarding reforming the law, the quote does imply that reform is needed. By not discuss-
ing reform you would still pass the question, but by discussing the issue you will demonstrate 
that you understand the wider issues surrounding the area and achieving a higher mark.
■ Consider why the law has remained in its current state for so long in light of the consen-
sus that it is not satisfactory.

  Question 2
  Question 2
‘There is no authority which decides that a rescuer is in any special position in relation 
to liability for psychiatric injury.’ (Per Lord Hoffmann in White v Chief Constable of South 
Yorkshire Police [1999] 2 AC 455 at 509)
Evaluate the approach to rescuers seeking damages for negligently inflicted psychiatric 
injury taken by the House of Lords in this case and the merit of the decision that was taken.
Answer plan
➜ Provide a brief factual overview of the case and set out the decision taken.
➜ Analyse the reasons given by the majority for not recognising a duty of care to those who 
are not at risk of physical injury and evaluate their merit.
➜ Contrast that to the reasoning of the minority and explain why they would have recognised a 
duty.
➜ Discuss the justification of the current position and whether a different approach should be 
adopted in the future.
Don’t be tempted to . . . 
■ Just focus on the requirements for establishing a duty, you need to evaluate why the law 
requires those points for this type of duty.
■ Simply describe what criticisms and reforms exist. While you will pick up marks for this 
knowledge, to get the really high marks you need to consider whether the criticisms have 
merit and whether a certain reform will make things better. Give an opinion as to what 
you think.
■ Focus exclusively on case law. There are a number of academics who have questioned 
the merit of the law and/or offered reform proposals. Draw on these to build up just how 
large the consensus is on the proposition within the question.

Answer
Rescuers have been thought to hold1 a special position with regards to 
the tort of negligence and the issue here is the merit of the decision in 
White v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [1999] 2 AC 
455 where this idea was rejected in the context of a claim for psychi-
atric injury. The rationale behind the majority’s decision is evaluated 
before assessing the merits of the dissenting opinions. It is argued 
that while within the context of the factual background to the case the 
decision is understandable, and denying rescuers a special position 
can be justified, overall the decision in terms of legal principle was 
unmerited and lacked principle.
Before an assessment of the decision can be made, it is necessary 
to outline the background from which it originates as the decision 
1 It is questionable that they 
do, or even did prior to the 
debate within this case. As 
such, it is important to phrase 
this in a way which shows it is 
not conclusive, but recognises 
the possibility. It is useful to 
raise it though as it provides 
context for the debate as 
to whether rescuers should 
have a special position for 
psychiatric injury. You can 
then pick up on the point later 
in your answer if you choose.
Consider the dissent of Lord Goff
Set out why he would have found liability
Evaluate whether this view would be more
meritorious than what was decided
Discuss why finding a duty was deemed an
unacceptable result

  Question 2
was unarguably influenced by the context to which it was made.2 
The case arose from the Hillsborough disaster and is inextricably 
linked to Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police 
[1992] 1 AC 310. While Alcock concerned unsuccessful claims 
for psychiatric injury by the relatives of those that had died, the 
claimants in White were the policemen who suffered such injuries 
through their involvement in the disaster and the assistance they gave 
in its aftermath, although they were never at risk of physical harm 
themselves. Initially, the claimants were unsuccessful, but some won 
on appeal. The defendant appealed in turn, with one ground being3 
that, even if considered rescuers, as the officers were not in any 
reasonably foreseeable physical danger, they would have to satisfy 
the Alcock control mechanisms to be successful.
The case of Chadwick v British Railway Board [1967] 1 WLR 
912 was relied on as the basis for arguing that rescuers were in a 
special category and free of control mechanisms. Chadwick spent 12 
hours crawling around a train wreck giving assistance to the injured 
passengers and suffered psychiatric injury as a result.4 However, in 
allowing the appeal, the majority deemed Mr. Chadwick to be simply 
what is now considered a primary victim as he was at risk of physical 
injury while providing the assistance. As such, it was not authority 
for the proposition that a rescuer was in any sort of special position 
regarding psychiatric injury.5 Lord Hoffmann acknowledged the law 
could be extended to cover the situation at hand; however, he noted 
two reasons for not doing so. First, he noted a rescuer is currently 
clearly understood as being someone who puts themselves in phys-
ical danger. If the term was extended to cover those not at risk of 
physical injury it would be difficult to distinguish them from mere 
bystanders. By contrast, Lord Griffiths6 held that, while a distinction 
is needed between providing immediate assistance at the scene and 
participation once the victim is safe, this could easily be determined 
on the facts of each case. Therefore, Lord Griffiths would have dis-
missed the appeal and allowed the law to be extended, provided it 
was still reasonably foreseeable that the rescuer in question would 
suffer psychiatric injury through their participation in the event. This 
is arguably the better view as it permits control to be maintained, 
but allows for flexibility where merited. It also reflects advances in 
2 By setting this out you 
have a yardstick from which 
to determine whether the 
decision of the case was 
correct. The history of the 
case provided an important 
basis for the decision of the 
majority.
3 Obviously, there were two 
grounds to the appeal, one 
regarding the duty owed as 
employee and one on the 
basis of their rescuer status. 
As the question is focused on 
rescuers, you need to focus 
on just that aspect of the 
appeal.
4 You need to give the brief 
facts to explain why the case 
was being relied on by the 
claimants for the proposition 
under discussion.
5 It is important to state this, 
as the perceived absence of 
authority allowed the majority 
to come at the matter as they 
did on policy grounds. It also 
sets up a contrast to Lord Goff, 
which can be evaluated later.
6 As Lord Griffiths’ reasons for 
dissenting on this point are 
at complete odds with Lord 
Hoffmann’s, raise them now 
as a way of testing the merit 
of the majority’s view rather 
than as advancement of a 
distinct argument against the 
decision later.

36
3  Negligence: Duty of care for psychiatric injury
medicinal knowledge,7 noted previously in Page v Smith [1996] AC 
155, meaning it is difficult to distinguish physical and psychiatric 
consequences of trauma, and focus instead on personal injury as an 
overall concept.
Lord Hoffmann’s second reason was based on public policy. He felt 
that if the claimants were better off than those in Alcock, ordinary 
people would be offended and think it unfair that similar cases were 
not being treated alike. This was supported by Lord Steyn who 
considered it would be an ‘unedifying spectacle’.8 Lord Griffiths 
again disagreed that the public would find it offensive. The important 
point was their suffering of a recognised psychiatric illness alongside 
their involvement as events unfolded, as opposed to mere grief and 
bereavement and assistance after the event. In view of the background 
context of the decision, it is hard to argue with the concerns of the 
majority.9 However, approaching the matter ignorant of the Alcock 
decision and looking simply at the direct facts of White it is hard to 
deny the merit of the approach advocated by Lord Griffiths.
In also dismissing the appeal, Lord Goff offered a different basis10 
which is arguably more forceful. He highlighted how Mr. Chadwick 
did not actually rescue anyone, but simply brought aid and comfort. 
Additionally, he noted that while Mr. Chadwick had faced some phys-
ical danger, it was treated as irrelevant by the judge who attributed 
his injuries to the whole horror of the event. Lord Goff felt each point 
was significant as the first meant that we need not be restricted by 
the meaning of rescuer while the second indicated that there was no 
reason to single out for compensation only those who had done res-
cue acts where those acts were only incidental to the wider incident 
which, overall, caused the psychiatric injury. His Lordship suggested 
that requiring a rescuer to be objectively at risk of physical injury was, 
in fact, contrary to authority. This meant that the majority were wrong 
in viewing the question as to whether the law should be extended, 
rather than whether the law should be restricted.11 Consequently, the 
majority were viewed as imposing an artificial barrier against recov-
ery for foreseeable psychiatric injury. Furthermore, Lord Goff felt the 
majority views were misconceived with their concerns of public opin-
ion being offended if the claimants succeeded. The function of tort is 
to correct wrongs by having the wrongdoer compensate the person 
7 The point here is to raise the 
issue of whether, if medical 
professionals struggle to 
distinguish the two types of 
injury and look at the overall 
idea of personal injury, the 
law should be making such 
a firm distinction. This gives 
you another basis to explore 
the merit of the current 
legal position and what was 
decided.
8 While essentially the same 
as Lord Hoffmann’s, if you 
include the opinion of Lord 
Steyn you demonstrate your 
knowledge of the whole 
case and provide variation of 
material in support of your 
argument.
9 As the majority were so 
clearly swayed by the factual 
background to the case and 
the decision in Alcock, it is 
important to have raised this 
beforehand. By doing so you 
give yourself a platform from 
which to fully evaluate the 
reasoning given in the case.
10 Therefore, your answer 
will benefit from Lord Goff’s 
reasoning being looked at 
separately from Lord Griffiths’.
11 It is quite central to explaining 
Lord Goff’s opinion that you 
highlight the different way that 
he saw the question to be 
asked in the case. Therefore, 
you need to state what the 
question was in his view in 
order to fully demonstrate your 
understanding of his reasoning.

37
  Question 2
they injure.12 That some claimants will fail to satisfy the necessary 
requirements of their case was no reason to restrict all claims of 
that type. The focus should be on the individual parties in each case, 
but with the same principles applied in each instance. The position 
as Lord Goff saw it would defeat the claim by a policeman who was 
a mere witness to event, but the position advanced by the majority 
would, while also defeating such a claim, deny a relative who had 
attempted a rescue. It is hard to argue with this reasoning, particularly 
as it retains principle within the law13 which the majority conceded 
had been lost in their view.
To conclude, it is now settled that a rescuer who is at no risk of phys-
ical injury must satisfy the Alcock control mechanism to be success-
ful. While denying rescuers special status has merit, and the decision 
in fact suggests that they do not have such status for physical injury 
either, the overall outcome of the case leaves the law in an unjustifi-
able and unprincipled state, a point in fact conceded by the majority. 
From an emotional perspective, the decision is understandable in that 
parity was being sought with the claimants in Alcock; however, for 
the benefit of the law as a whole, the view of the minority from the 
case is preferable.
12 As Lord Goff was basing his 
opinion firmly on tort principles, 
you need to provide some 
explanation as to the underlying 
principle and function of tort 
law. This will strengthen your 
discussion of Lord Goff’s 
opinion and show the depth of 
your understanding of tort law 
generally.
13 The law is widely deemed to 
be unsatisfactory in this area 
and lacking principle so it is 
important to look at the merits 
of each side in the case and 
how well they sit with the 
overall principles of tort and 
past case law.
Make your answer stand out
■ Explore the point raised by Lord Hoffmann in White that rescuers do not even receive 
special treatment in cases of physical injury.
■ Extend the discussion regarding the validity of distinguishing between physical and 
psychiatric injuries in light of medical advances.
■ Tailor your answer to suit your view; if you actually disagree with the minority end your 
answer with the views of the majority and why they are more justified. This will ensure 
that your answer finishes strongly.
■ Offer your own view as to what the law should be in order to be in a better state if you 
feel that to be the case. If you have identified a problem, try to solve it. Do make sure 
that you substantiate any opinion by expressing the basis for that opinion.
■ Draw on the wealth of academic literature on the topic in order to support the different 
positions that you are considering, for example Geach, N. (2012) ‘Re-establishing

How this topic may come up in exams
While these all naturally come together in a problem question, as shown in 
Chapter 5, as with the duty concept each is examinable as an individual essay. For 
breach questions you will need to ensure that you know what are the factors the 
courts consider, and be able to evaluate how and why they are used, as well as when 
they will be adapted. Causation is very popular for essay questions as it has many 
different complex subsections. Therefore, you will need a firm understanding of the 
judicial reasoning in causation cases, and be able to evaluate whether those opinions 
have merit. Ensure you have also read sufficient academic opinion to support your 
argument. Remoteness and defences are less likely as individual essays.

in order not to be in breach of a duty of care in negligence, and whether it is right to say that 
the standard is not tailored to the person individually.

When determining whether a person’s conduct has reached the 
standard required by the law,1 a multitude of factors are considered. 
The issue is the extent to which the personal attributes of the defend-
ant should be considered in setting this standard in order to tailor the

  Question 1
duty to the person concerned.2 Depending on the factors considered 
the standard required will vary; consequently, liability depends on 
what is assessed. If no consideration is given to the individual defend-
ant, liability could arise without personal fault and through the impo-
sition of a standard that their personal characteristics could prevent 
them reaching. It is argued that while certain factors pertaining to the 
defendant need to be considered, the standard is not determined by 
reference to the specific individual concerned.
The standard of care determines whether a person is negligent in 
conducting an activity; it dictates whether their duty of care has been 
breached or not. First, the legal standard required is established and, 
as seen in Paris v Stepney BC [1951] AC 367, this is to take such 
care as is reasonable in the circumstances of the case. It is an objec-
tive test which considers how the hypothetical reasonable person 
would have acted in those circumstances. It is then a question of fact 
whether the standard was met.
By assessing the reasonable person’s actions, an objective range of 
factors that are, naturally, impersonal to the defendant is assessed. 
Several factors are considered, but the main ones3 are the likeli-
hood and magnitude of harm, plus the preventability of that harm.  
The more likely the harm is to occur, the more care should be taken, 
particularly where that harm is easily preventable. A good illustration 
is Paris where the nature of the work meant harm was likely to 
occur and would be great if it did due to the claimant already having 
partial vision; this could have been prevented by simply supplying 
goggles.4 An additional external factor considered is the nature of 
the situation. If the act occurs within an emergency situation, it 
is reasonable to act with less care than in a more time-sensitive 
situation.
However, notwithstanding these impersonal factors, it is not entirely 
accurate to say that the standard of care is completely without 
reference to the defendant.5 The words ‘in the circumstances’ are 
important so as to set the standard appropriately to the context of 
the situation and this necessitates looking at who the defendant is. 
Arguably, this is also necessary to warrant a finding of personal fault 
2 When demonstrating your 
understanding of the issue of 
the question, link it into the 
wording of the quote to show 
you have understood the 
context of the quote as well.
3 Use this to show that you 
know that there are more 
but also to indicate that you 
are consciously looking at 
a limited few. Looking only 
at the main factors will also 
allow you time to balance 
your answer by exploring in 
more depth the factors which 
relate to the defendant.
4 You could use another case in 
this context, but Paris is good 
as you have already used it as 
the authority for the general 
standard to be reached and also 
because the facts encapsulate 
all three of the main factors 
that are highlighted, so it saves 
some time. Remember, though, 
that while it is beneficial to show 
some of your knowledge of 
case law, do not dwell too long 
on pure facts at the expense of 
argument.
5 This is your most important 
paragraph: you need to show 
that, while there are some 
factors which pertain to the 
defendant who is considered, 
these are still viewed 
objectively. This allows the 
latter part of your answer to 
explore these factors for their 
justifications and explains why 
your answer has gone in this 
direction.

44
4  Negligence: Breach, causation, remoteness and defences
(as noted by Browne-Wilkinson VC in Wilsher).6 However, it was 
held in Glasgow Corporation v Muir [1943] AC 448 that the test 
is impersonal, eliminating the personal equation. To achieve fairness, 
the defendant’s attributes which are characteristic of a class of which 
they are a member are ascribed to the reasonable person and con-
sidered objectively. Focusing on the defendant’s class rather than on 
them individually supports the aim of negligence which is to require 
a certain standard of care when activities are undertaken; this stip-
ulating of how one should act being part of the regulatory function 
of tort generally.7
One personal characteristic assessed is the torfeasor’s age as it would 
be unfair to expect a child to act as an adult would. The question 
becomes: what degree of care and foresight is reasonable to expect 
of a child of that age (Mullin v Richards [1998] WLR 1304)? This is 
necessary to allow children to play boisterously and enjoy life without 
the threat of facing personal injury litigation from playing games like 
tag, as in Orchard v Lee [2009] EWCA Civ 295. This contrasts 
with the approach to disability or infirmity8 which is not considered. 
By undertaking the activity in question, knowing of their disability, 
defendants are adjudged negligent (Roberts v Ramsbottom [1980] 
1 WLR 823).
Whether the defendant has, or ought to have, special knowledge of 
the claimant is another assessed factor attributable to the defendant 
(Paris). If the defendant knows the claimant has a condition that 
makes them more susceptible to injury, or greater injury, then it is just 
to expect them to take a greater degree of care. This can be seen as 
overlapping with the external factors considered earlier as it means 
they should be more aware of the likelihood and magnitude of harm.
One of the most significant attributes of a defendant is their level 
of knowledge/intelligence. Low intellect will not excuse negligent 
conduct (Vaughan v Menlove (1837) 132 ER 490) while liability 
will not necessarily result from failing to use one’s higher intellect 
(Wooldridge v Sumner [1963] 2 QB 43). The reasonable person 
is simply given normal levels of intelligence; however, where the 
defendant’s status is relevant to the conduct in question, this is 
considered. Such circumstances warrant altering the reasonable 
6 This links this part of your 
argument back to what was 
said in the introduction and 
provides the justification for 
that initial comment. It is 
better here than there, as 
the introduction is just that, 
whereas here you can get into 
the matter more and evaluate 
it better.
7 It is around this point 
that you can, and should, 
include some evaluation 
as to why these factors 
are needed and why a 
subjective account of the 
defendant’s characteristics 
is not undertaken. This 
will prevent your answer 
coming across as just a 
list of factors. In doing so, 
relate your discussion back 
to the primary principles and 
theories of tort. This will show 
your deeper understanding of 
the subject as a whole.
8 As such factors are not 
considered, use them as a 
contrast to how age is dealt 
with within this paragraph 
rather than as a separate 
issue.

45
  Question 1
person’s knowledge to that of someone of the defendant’s status so 
as to fully and fairly assess their conduct. For example, a reasonable 
chief engineer would have known of the risk of discharging the oil in 
The Wagon Mound (No. 2) [1967] AC 88, so liability resulted.
This leads into consideration of the defendant’s skills and whether 
when a person possessing certain skills injures another when exer-
cising that skill they should be judged by reference to the reasonable 
person who also possesses those skills. The law takes a hard line, 
as seen in Nettleship v Weston [1971] 2 QB 691 where learner 
drivers were judged to the standard of reasonable, qualified drivers. 
Unlike scenarios such as Chaudhry v Prabhakar [1989] 1 WLR 
29, a learner does not hold themselves out as having enhanced 
skills, in fact their learner plates show the opposite. However, this 
approach can be justified on policy grounds as otherwise there would 
be problems in obtaining insurance and assessing liability based on 
experience.9 Similarly, professionals are judged to the standard of the 
reasonable person of their profession, regardless of their experience 
(Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee [1957] 1 WLR 
582). Patient confidence dictates doctors cannot plead inexperience 
for poor operations, thus also enhancing tort’s deterrence and eco-
nomic efficiency principles. However, under Bolam professionals do 
have leeway if they can show that a respected body of opinion from 
that profession would have acted in the same way, even if others 
would not have so acted. Provided the opinion supporting the conduct 
withstands scrutiny (Bolitho v City and Hackney HA [1998] AC 
232), this is permissible to reflect legitimate variations in professional 
opinions as to such conduct which makes it harder to say what is 
unreasonable.
In conclusion, it is clear that the standard required by a duty in negli-
gence is not specifically tailored to the individual defendant, with any 
breach being determined on an objective view of the activity albeit in 
light of the circumstances of the case.10 The need to determine the 
standard in light of those circumstances means there is unavoidably 
some consideration of the individual defendant’s characteristics. How-
ever, the manner in which this is done means the standard remains 
objective and impersonal.
9 This section is needed in 
order to illustrate why there 
is a tough stance taken. Use 
this to try and either justify or 
argue against the approach 
the law takes with regard to 
these factors.

mirrors the wording of the

started your answer in

consistent structure and

within the context of the

rounds off the discussion 
nicely.

  Question 2
‘In a case where medical science cannot establish the probability that “but for” an act of 
negligence the injury would not have happened but can establish that the contribution of the 
negligent cause was more than negligible, the “but for” test is modified, and the claimant 
will succeed.’ (Per Waller LJ in Bailey v Ministry of Defence [2009] 1 WLR 1052 at [46])
Evaluate the instances when a court will depart from the ‘but for’ test in favour of an alterna-
tive test and consider whether the law is satisfactory.

■ Ensure that you offer some evaluation of each factor. It is quite easy to have your answer 
simply slide into a descriptive narrative that will only get so many marks.
■ Explore whether the approach of the courts in dismissing subjective personal factors, 
specific to the particular defendant, could be said to be introducing a touch of strict liability

v Ramsbottom [1980] 1 WLR 823 and Mansfield v Weetabix Ltd [1998] 1 WLR 1263.
■ Expand your reading beyond the standard textbooks and look at texts such as Clerk 
and Lindsell on Negligence and Charlesworth and Percy on Negligence in order to 
substantiate your points with academic opinion and use these to complement or counter 
the judicial reasoning that you draw on from the case law.

■ Try and get through every factor you come across from your reading. You will not be able 
to cover them all in depth and risk your answer being a descriptive list which will only get 
you so many marks. Just focus on providing an evaluation of the main ones.
■ Turn your answer into a list of cases and facts if giving an example for each factor.
■ Cover all aspects of negligence; the question is very specifically concerned with breach 
of duty.

Answer
The issue to address is the test used for determining causation in 
negligence and how it is modified depending on the circumstances. 
Strict adherence to the traditional approach has led to many claimants 
going uncompensated, whereas in certain circumstances claimants 
benefit from a relaxation of the rules. It will be argued that this dis-
crepancy in the law can be justified and so the law is satisfactory.
The standard approach for determining causation was devised in 
Cork v Kirby Maclean [1952] 2 All ER 402, and is to apply a simple 
test to the facts. One asks whether, ‘but for’ the negligent act, the 
claimant would have suffered their injury. This requires looking at

whether, on the balance of probabilities, the negligent act was the 
most likely cause of the claimant’s injury. Where there is an over 50 
per cent chance that the negligent act was the cause, it is treated as 
the 100 per cent cause. Where it is shown that the injury was likely 
to have occurred even without the negligence, the defendant cannot 
be deemed the factual cause of the injury. Hotson v East Berkshire 
AHA [1987] AC 750 illustrates this, with the judge holding that as 
there was only a 25 per cent chance that without the negligence the 
condition would have been avoided, the injury was already in place 
prior to the negligence.1 In Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw 
[1956] AC 613, Lord Reid noted the authorities supported the propo-
sition that the question is whether on the balance of probabilities the 
defendant caused or materially contributed to the injury. Although 
Wardlaw concerned cumulative causes, the issue of material contri-
bution to the injury applies where the cause is one of several distinct 
factors as seen in Wilsher v Essex AHA [1988] AC 1074. Here a 
prematurely born baby was given excessive oxygen by the hospital 
and later suffered blindness, but there were four other completely 
separate risks which the baby was exposed to which could have 
caused the blindness. Lord Bridge framed the question throughout 
as one of showing that the excess oxygen administered to the baby 
was the cause or material contribution of the blindness. However, 
the problem was the presence of the other factors, which meant that 
it could not be shown that ‘but for’ the contribution of the negligent 
cause, the injury would not have occurred. The application of the 
‘but for’ test for the material contribution of injury in such a case 
was affirmed in Bailey v Ministry of Defence [2009] 1 WLR 1052.
As Wilsher shows, the test has been rigorously applied in medical 
negligence cases: however, in cases of negligent exposure to indus-
trial illnesses,2 the courts have been willing to relax the ‘but for’ test 
to overcome causal uncertainties. In Wardlaw, while the fact that a 
material contribution would suffice as opposed to actually causing the 
injury, the issue was complicated by the fact that the case concerned 
a cumulative cause scenario. Wardlaw contracted pneumoconiosis 
from inhaling silicon dust while at work. There were two sources of 
inhalation, an innocent cause from using a pneumatic hammer which 
could not be avoided, and a negligent cause by his employer who 
had failed to maintain the extraction plant. Wardlaw succeeded as, 
while it could not be said that ‘but for’ the negligence the injury would 
not have occurred – indeed the evidence showed it was insufficient 
1 It is the decision of the case 
and its reasoning here which 
you need to illustrate your 
point, so there is no need to 
give a fuller factual account.
2 The fact that these cases are 
set in a different context is 
important as to why the same 
policy factors as Wilsher have 
not been applied. Therefore, 
you need to flag up this 
difference in setting.

  Question 2
to have caused it – the evidence showed that his employer’s con-
tribution to him contracting the illness was more than negligible.3 
In Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd [2002] UKHL 22 
Lord Rodger expressly stated4 that the ‘but for’ test is departed from 
in such situations.
The approach was developed further by McGhee v National Coal 
Board [1973] 1 WLR 1. McGhee, through his job, was non-negli-
gently exposed to brick-dust and then negligently not provided with 
washing facilities, which prolonged the exposure while he travelled 
home. Subsequently, he developed dermatitis which medical evi-
dence showed was from the exposure. However, the evidence only 
showed that the prolonged exposure increased the risk of dermatitis 
but not that this negligent exposure had caused it. Lord Reid felt 
that there was no distinction between a material contribution and a 
material increase in risk, although this was rejected in Fairchild. Lord 
Wilberforce justified liability on the basis that where a person creates 
a risk by breaching a duty, and injury ensues from within the area of 
risk, he should bear the loss unless he can show there was another 
cause. This was a matter of justice as the employer should be taken 
to foresee the possible injury and thus bear the consequences.5 At 
first glance this might seem unfair on the defendant who becomes 
liable for injury which it is unclear that he caused. However, it certainly 
achieves justice for the claimant and would seem to be grounded in 
tort principles such as ideas of corrective justice and loss distribution. 
A wrong has been done with a foreseeable outcome; the employer is 
in a better position to bear such a loss through insurance and could 
prevent liability through better working practices, another aim of tort.
Therefore, a shift in approach has been undertaken by the courts 
in relation to causation and the application of the ‘but for’ test, with 
departure permitted where, as Lord Rodger states in Fairchild, ‘it is 
inherently impossible for the claimant to prove exactly how his injury 
was caused’. The principle, started in Wardlaw and developed in 
McGhee, can be applied where the claimant has proved all they 
can, with the causal link of the injury needing scientific investiga-
tion which cannot be concluded because science itself is uncertain 
as to the cause.6 Wilsher appeared to make a distinction between 
industrial cases and medical cases. While justified on the grounds 
of protecting NHS funds, this has now rightly been removed by 
Bailey which stated that there is no policy reason for not applying 
3 Do not forget this 
qualification to the decision 
as this forms part of the 
justification to the decision.
4 By referring to Lord Rodger 
in Fairchild, you have 
high level authority for the 
statement which you are 
making.
5 This is still part of Lord 
Wilberforce’s reasoning which 
you need to set out before 
considering whether McGhee 
was an acceptable departure 
from the traditional position.
6 Although a judicial quote has 
just been stated as to how/
when the principle operates, 
you ought to demonstrate 
that you understand it by 
explaining it and developing 
the point.

McGhee in cumulative-cause medical cases, which does provide 
some consistency.7
However, Bailey did retain a distinction between cases where the 
cause is cumulative but flowing from essentially the same substance 
or where there are distinct, alternative causes as in Wilsher. In the 
former, to alleviate the evidential uncertainty the ‘but for’ test is 
departed from, and possibilities are considered rather than proba-
bilities. As noted above,8 this is justifiable under tort principles, but it 
raises questions as to why the same tort principles are not applied to 
a Wilsher-style case. However, the key distinguishing factor is that 
in Wilsher there were several independent causes.9 No commonality 
existed and so it is hard to say that the hospital’s negligence even 
contributed to the injury; the uncertainty is too great. Imposing liability 
would be too unfair and thus justice is ensured between the parties in 
question; no wrong needs correcting.

4  Negligence: Breach, causation, remoteness and defences
Answer
Whether loss of a chance is an injury which warrants being an action-
able head of damage in negligence is an important issue, as rec-
ognising such harm would give effect to a fundamental principle of 
tort, namely corrective justice. However, it would potentially increase 
litigation against the NHS and lead to defensive medical practices.1 It 
will be argued that theoretically the stronger argument is that it should 
be adopted while equally any practical complaints can be overcome.2
In Gregg v Scott [2005] 2 AC 176, the defendant misdiagnosed a 
lump under the claimant’s arm as harmless when in fact it was can-
cerous. The misdiagnosis was revealed nine months later when Gregg 
visited another GP after the lump had grown.3 Resultantly, the cancer 
spread, reducing Gregg’s chances of recovery from 42 per cent to 25 
per cent, therefore no injury had occurred which was caused by Scott. 
On the balance of probabilities, there was no chance of recovery to 
lose. Gregg unsuccessfully appealed on two grounds, the second 
being that loss of a chance should be an actionable injury itself.
Lord Hoffmann dismissed this ground4 for lacking a principled basis. 
He regarded the law as deeming everything to have a determinate 
cause even if that cause is not known. A lack of knowledge and 
evidential difficulty do not make the cause indeterminate. He consid-
ered economic loss cases could be explained owing to an act of an 
independent third party which was not the case here; it was simply 
whether the defendant caused the injury.
Responding to counsel’s argument that a wrong required remedy-
ing,5 he argued any remedy required widening the limited exception 
for departing from the normal rules of causation from Fairchild v 
Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd [2003] 1 AC 32 and departing 
from Wilshire v Essex AHA [1988] AC 1074 and Hotson v East 
Berkshire AHA [1987] AC 750; yet the arguments had not changed 
since those cases. Gregg argued that the Fairchild principle could 
be narrowly extended by confining it to cases in which the claimant 
had already suffered an injury. Lord Hoffmann felt this was artificial 
and akin to limitations which had ‘disfigured’ the law on psychiatric 
injury. Such a restriction had no underlying principle to it nor did the 
alternative restriction of limiting the principle to cases where medical 
knowledge as to the cause was lacking. While Lord Hoffmann was

  Question 3
adamant that the claim should not succeed, no reason was advanced 
against the latter restriction and it was the complete opposite of how 
Lord Nicholls saw that issue.6
Lord Nicholls, allowing the appeal,7 felt the matter was, in principle, 
‘clear and compelling’;8 actionable loss should cover the loss of a 
favourable outcome rather than just the lost outcome itself. He argued 
this would ‘match medical reality’ and recognise what, in practice, 
the patient had before the negligent act and thus what has been lost. 
He further argued that the extent of the duty owed by doctors is to 
exercise care and skill when diagnosing and treating patients. This 
is hollowed by stating that just because a favourable outcome was 
originally less than 50 per cent it can be negligently reduced; there 
would be no need to exercise the requisite care on a patient in such 
a position.
Underlying this reasoning was the recognition that tort’s principal 
objective is to provide redress where a duty has been breached. The 
principle of corrective justice centres on injuries being corrected by 
the payment of compensation; it is hard to see even on grounds of 
distributive justice why the former should be departed from. Lord 
Nicholls argued that leaving a claimant without redress in this situ-
ation would leave the law deficient and, notwithstanding Lord Hoff-
mann’s view, ‘open to reproach’ in light of the differing approach 
taken to loss of financial opportunities.
He furthered countered Lord Hoffmann’s argument by considering that 
it is not always true that the patient’s actual condition at the time of 
the negligence will determine the answer to the hypothetical question 
which must be asked as to what would have happened ‘but for’ the 
negligent act. As such, Gregg was not covered by authority as Lord 
Hoffmann suggested. In Gregg, the answer to the latter question was 
laced with uncertainty and could only be answered by recourse to 
statistics expressed in percentage terms. Reflecting this, there were 
no theoretical grounds for holding that compensation could not be 
awarded for the diminution of recovery. By restricting the development 
to where the claimant already has the illness complained of, he felt it 
also left the Fairchild principle unaffected.9
It does appear that tort is placing financial interests above the chance 
of achieving personal well-being, which is strange considering that 
claims for pure economic loss are tightly restricted. The justification

opinion straightaway gives

evaluation which you should 
be seeking to provide in 
your answer, as it is in direct 
contrast to the argument 
which you have advanced.

you advanced earlier.

could lie in the practical difficulties in adopting this change. Lord 
Nicholls addressed some of these implications, although not in as 
much depth as the theoretical arguments. He simply stated that the 
fear of floodgates was not a convincing enough reason for departing 
from the principal objective of tort. In terms of increased costs to 
the NHS, he felt, while a formidable argument, it was ‘unacceptable’ 
and by keeping the development to the tightly defined circumstances 
which he did and insisting on a significant reduction in the chance of 
recovery this would combat the issue. Finally, regarding claims that 
defensive medical practices would result, he noted that doctors are 
already aware that they face being sued if they are negligent and thus 
this argument was unimpressive.
It could be said that Lord Nicholls’ failure to go into more depth weak-
ened his opinion and he certainly does not counter the argument of 
Lady Hale that nearly all claims based on loss of an outcome could 
be changed to a loss of a chance of that outcome. This would result, 
if both were retained, in the defendant always being liable, as the 
claimant would always have the fallback position of a proportionate 
claim. This could be unfair, but it misses the fact that they have been 
at fault and, therefore, based on corrective justice principles, it is 
not necessarily an unfair situation. A stronger argument was that 
for some claimants this could be a negative development. If both 
types of claims could not be retained and the latter were adopted, 
then claimants who currently get 100 per cent compensation would 
suddenly get less. This is detrimental to claimants but arguably fairer 
for defendants and would further best recognise the medical reality 
of the situation.
In conclusion, in principle a lost favourable outcome should be action-
able.10 Gregg differed from Hotson; the eventual outcome ‘but for’ 
the negligent act was not determined at the time of that act. Even 
Lady Hale’s concerns could be argued as having some positive con-
sequences, with any issues as to quantifying damages being resolved 
in practice. Potential implementation difficulties should not prevent 
the law’s development in a fair manner consistent with fundamental 
principles. The potential impact on the NHS needs to be monitored, 
with Parliament stepping in if it proves detrimental.

Answer
For any claim to be successful in tort, the injury suffered must not be 
too remote from the act of the defendant. Therefore, the issue is how 
the courts should best go about determining whether negligent acts 
will be deemed to be the legal cause of injury. This has implications 
for claimants as, even if the defendant factually caused the injury, 
they may still not receive compensation. The current approach will be 
evaluated to explain why it is better than the original approach from 
Re Polemis [1921] 3 KB 560.
Remoteness is the law’s attempt to limit liability on policy grounds 
even where the defendant has factually caused the injury.1 This 
restriction is justified2 as liability is based on the risk that the negli-
gence creates. If the injury is outside of this risk, it is unfair to impose 
liability. The issue, therefore, is how the law determines whether the 
injury was within the scope of risk for which liability should result.

whether the approach to 
remoteness is appropriate, 
you need to explain what this 
aspect of negligence is about 
and what it attempts to do.

whether the actual purpose 
of remoteness is justified,

  Question 4
Originally, following Re Polemis, remoteness was determined by 
looking at whether the injury was a direct consequence of the neg-
ligent act regardless of its foreseeability. In the case, a ship was 
destroyed when, through the negligence of the stevedores, a rope 
from a sling led to a wooden plank dropping into the ship’s hold which 
in turn caused a spark because the hold contained benzine vapour.3 
The court acknowledged that this outcome was not a foreseeable 
consequence of the negligent act. However, it held that provided 
the outcome was a direct cause of the negligence, it was irrelevant 
whether the defendant could anticipate that outcome. Foreseeability 
of the consequences went towards negligence not compensation. 
What would amount to ‘direct’ was not explained, and questions could 
be asked about how someone is meant to guard against such an 
outcome if they do not know what they may be liable for. However, the 
decision itself can be said to be fair; a negligent act was performed 
which caused damage. As such, liability should ensue as that dam-
age was caused by the negligence, thereby sanctioning negligent 
behaviour and awarding compensation for loss suffered, which are 
two functions of tort.4 The decision could also be justified owing to the 
circumstances of the time. As Davies (1982) noted, the case was tried 
during a slump in the shipping industry5 and so the decision would 
have been a further blow to a struggling shipping industry if liability 
was not found. While not stated as a reason within the case, Davies 
argues it must surely have played a part; owing to the importance of 
shipping at the time this seems a fair assessment.
Although no criticism regarding excessive liability was made following 
the decision, negative comment did emerge after Donoghue v Ste-
venson [1932] AC 562 established a general principle for imposing 
a duty of care in novel situations. Academic criticisms over excessive 
liability were also combined with judicial comments, subsequent to 
Donoghue, which were at odds with Re Polemis and which never 
wholeheartedly endorsed the principle.
This culminated in the Privy Council6 decision of The Wagon Mound 
(No. 1). Viscount Simonds felt that the Polemis approach over-
complicated matters with a prime example being a defence based 
around intervening acts. Furthermore, he felt that the basis of Re 
Polemis, whereby the issue of foreseeability related to liability rather

Your purpose here is to help 
set up the debate later in

5 The point of highlighting 
this is so you can give some 
context to the decision and 
then also argue whether, 
even if the principle behind 
the case is flawed, there is 
still some justification to the 
decision. You are looking to 
provide an explanation for the 
case.
6 By including reference to this 
you could explore how binding 
this decision should be

58
4  Negligence: Breach, causation, remoteness and defences
than whether compensation was payable, was false. He noted that 
liability is founded upon the consequences of the act, not the act 
itself. Therefore a new approach was adopted whereby the ques-
tion to ask is simply: was the injury of a type which was reasonably 
foreseeable to occur from the negligence? His Lordship felt that it 
was unjust to impose liability simply because an injury is a natural 
consequence, especially if completely unforeseeable.7 Although he 
noted the opposite was true, where injury is reasonably foreseeable, 
even if an indirect consequence of the act, liability is fair and just. To 
hold otherwise would be at odds with principles of civil liability that a 
person is only liable for the probable causes of his/her acts, while still 
leaving minimum standards to be observed by society.
Interestingly, he did not feel that many cases would be decided any 
differently, and that in fact where damage was a direct or natural con-
sequence of the act they would be reasonably foreseeable. However, 
by insisting on reasonable foreseeability as the limitation of liability, 
it meant that liability was kept within the bounds of common con-
science. It is significant that the problems with Re Polemis began to 
emerge following the change to imposing duties in Donoghue; indeed 
Viscount Simonds states that to base remoteness on Re Polemis 
would be a departure from the sovereign principle of Donoghue. 
This ignores that Re Polemis was pre-Donoghue and decided at a 
time when the duty concept was narrowly applied to particular rela-
tionships. A wider test of remoteness only became an issue when the 
application of the duty concept was widened in Donoghue. However, 
this development means it is more logical to treat compensation the 
same as culpability with both based on foreseeability. The injury suf-
fered must be within the scope of any duty owed, otherwise the act 
cannot be said to be negligent. If duty is restricted on this basis, it 
is indeed unjust to still award compensation for injury which, while a 
cause of the act, was not something which the defendant could have 
foreseen and so taken steps to prevent.
However, the equating of remoteness with reasonable foreseeabil-
ity has created an overlap with the imposition of the duty of care.8 
This was seemingly accepted by Viscount Simonds, as he states that 
culpability dependent on reasonable foreseeability is determined by 
reference to the foreseeability of what actually happened. This raises 
the question as to why this separate element of the tort is needed.9 
7 As you are stating that the 
law was changed, you need 
to explain what his reasoning 
was. This then allows you 
to evaluate whether the 
reasoning, and by extension 
the change, was justifiable.
8 Even if you feel that the 
change was justified, you 
ought to explore what the 
consequences have been. 
Just because something has 
merit in theory you still need 
to look at how it works in 
practice.
9 The point here is to question 
whether the purpose of the 
element which you identified 
earlier is being carried out 
following this change.

59
  Question 4
Arguably, for remoteness to have any independent purpose, not-
withstanding the opinion of Viscount Simonds, hindsight must play 
a part.10 If the aim of remoteness is to determine whether the injury 
was one that was within the risk to which a duty was owed, then 
hindsight must be used to establish what risks were created by the 
act of the defendant. Otherwise, the test advanced by his Lordship 
does not work.
In conclusion, while it was in fact Donoghue that caused the prob-
lems for Re Polemis and not the test itself, the argument has merit: 
it is clear that with the approach to duty of care firmly established, a 
test based on foreseeability makes more sense. While this approach 
does raise questions as to the overall need for such a test, it creates 
an extra precaution against liability, helping to ensure that liability and 
the resultant compensation only occur where justified.

  Question 5
‘[There] is a need in the law of tort for a principle which permits judges to deny recovery to 
a [claimant] on the ground that to do so would undermine the integrity of the justice system.’ 
(Per McLachlin J in Hall v Hebert (1993) 101 DLR (4th) 129, 179)
In light of this statement, critically discuss the occasions when negligence denies recovery to a 
claimant by allowing a defendant a defence to the claim and the extent to which this is justified.
Answer plan
➜ Consider each defence in turn and explain the circumstances in which each operates.
➜ Assess whether there is justification for denying recovery by the claimant based on the prin-
ciples of each defence.
➜ Evaluate the requirements of each as you do so.

  Question 5
justification for their application. However, it is argued that applying 
contributory negligence more broadly at the expense of the others 
would produce the fairest outcome in view of the overall principles 
underlying liability in negligence.
The main reason for denying compensation is that, notwithstanding 
the defendant’s fault, the claimant consented to the injury or the 
risk of it. If one voluntarily invites the risk, they cannot complain if 
it materialises. Therefore, such a defence makes good sense and 
is just (Smith v Baker & Sons [1891] AC 325). What is unclear is 
whether the defence operates by removing the existence of the duty 
or negating liability for the breach. However, in any event, the overall 
outcome is the same with the courts determining the final issue on 
the facts of the case before them.1
To justify denying recovery, there must be informed consent as to the 
nature of the risk of negligent injury (Nettleship v Weston [1971] 
2QB 691). It must be shown that the claimant had full knowledge 
of the extent of the risk that they faced, and that they agreed to 
that risk. In the absence of an express agreement, it can be implied 
through a deliberate course of conduct (Smith). Secondly, the legal 
consequences of the risk must be assumed voluntarily (Nettleship). 
Therefore, the defence generally has no applicability in cases involv-
ing employees and rescuers, on the basis they act out of compul-
sion, not their own volition. This is justifiable on policy grounds, as 
otherwise employers would never be responsible for the safety of 
their workplaces and rescuers may be deterred from acting.2 Per-
haps more controversially, the defence does not apply to suicides. 
While seemingly a clear, voluntary act of risking death, applying the 
defence hollows the specific duty owed by the defendant (Reeves v 
Metropolitan Police Commissioner [2000] 1 AC 360). This might 
seem strange in light of the defence denying the existence of a duty 
and, as Weir (2006) noted, it is at odds with the concept of personal 
autonomy. Yet, the non-application of the defence is justified, as the 
duty is to prevent that very outcome from occurring and the negli-
gence allowed it to in fact occur.
The defence is further limited by statutes.3 First, section 149 of the 
Road Traffic Act 1988 provides that a passenger does not consent to 
the risk of injury by entering a vehicle. As the driver must have insur-
ance for this scenario, it is fair to leave the burden of liability there.4 
1 Academically, it is worth 
acknowledging the debate 
and assessing the merits of 
each view, but demonstrate 
that you are aware of the 
practical implications of the 
defence more by highlighting 
that, in practice, it makes no 
difference to the individual 
relying on it. Look to question 
whether the exceptions 
undermine the defence or are 
justified in their own right as 
this stops your answer just 
becoming a description of the 
defence’s operation.
2 As you have set out 
previously that the defence is 
a justified means of denying 
a claimant recovery overall, 
you need to offer some 
explanation as to why it is right 
that it does not apply against 
all categories of claimant.
3 The logical place for you 
to discuss these is after the 
main discussion on consent, 
as they restrict the situations 
when that defence could be 
said to operate.
4 Make sure you offer some 
form of explanation as to why 
the defence is limited by the 
statute when at a first glance 
it appears it should apply. The 
same applies to the legislation 
governing contracts. Sections 
62 and 65 of the Consumer 
Rights Act 2015 provides the 
same in relation to consumer 
contracts.

62
4  Negligence: Breach, causation, remoteness and defences
The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (UCTA) also limits the defence’s 
application for liability arising out of things done, or to be done, in the 
course of a business, and on business premises. Liability for neg-
ligently caused death or personal injury can never be excluded or 
limited (s. 2(1)); however, other injuries can be if the relevant clause is 
reasonable (s. 2(2)). Further, under section 2(3), agreement or aware-
ness of a term purporting to exclude or limit liability for negligence is 
not to be taken as voluntarily assuming the risk. Policy underlies this; 
the consent cannot be said to be voluntary as it is extracted from the 
person who needs to enter the contract and as such lacks equality of 
bargaining power to negotiate the term.
Illegality by the claimant is another reason for denying them recov-
ery. While there is seemingly an obvious public policy justification to 
the defence, the claimant was injured engaging in criminal activity,5 
the rationale has not, however, always been clearly and consistently 
explained, and applied. This led the Law Commission to seek par-
liamentary clarification for many years. However, following Gray v 
Thames Trains Ltd [2009] UKHL 33 they now believe that the law 
has been clearly explained.6 The defence has two forms with each 
having a differing policy basis. The narrow form is where the claimant 
seeks to avoid a penalty imposed on him/her by the criminal law due 
to his/her illegal act, such as compensation for lost earnings, damage 
to reputation and general damages for imprisonment. The wider form 
is where the claimant seeks to recover compensation for the conse-
quences of his/her criminal act, such as compensation to cover their 
liability for unlawfully killing someone. This latter form was explained 
by Lord Hoffmann as being justified on the ground that compensating 
the claimant for the consequences of his/her criminal behaviour would 
offend public notions of the fair distribution of resources. Alterna-
tively, the narrower form is based on the idea that it would simply be 
inconsistent to compensate someone for the losses incurred by their 
going to prison for their criminal behaviour. In the wider sense, the 
issue becomes one of causation and the question is: was the damage 
caused by the criminal act; or while the criminal act provided the 
opportunity for the damage to occur, the tortious act was the immedi-
ate cause? This focus on whether the criminal act was incidental to the 
accident helps retains the legitimacy of the defence while providing a 
better rationale for cases such as Revill v Newbery [1996] QB 567 
where a burglar received compensation for having been shot.7
5 While your answer will go on 
to explore how the defence 
operates and on what basis, 
make sure you explain why it 
is needed. This is particularly 
important with this defence, 
which has been criticised 
historically for its lack of 
coherence.
6 The purpose here is not to 
provide the whole history 
of the defence, but to 
show that you are aware 
of its development and the 
concerns over it which have 
fuelled that. Keeping this 
brief allows you to focus on 
what the law is now, and 
whether it is justified now, 
while benefiting from knowing 
its past.
7 This is a good example to 
use as it is a case which was 
hard to explain previously 
as the claim seemed to be 
founded on the illegal act 
which used to be the stated 
basis for denying recovery.

63
  Question 5
The final way of denying recovery is through the principles of contrib-
utory negligence. Following the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) 
Act 1945, this is now a partial defence.8 Damages are reduced to 
reflect the amount that the claimant contributed to their injury through 
their negligence; three factors must be proven (Fookes v Slaytor 
[1978] 1 WLR 1293). First, the injury must result from the claimant 
exposing him/herself to a particular risk. Secondly, his/her negligence 
contributed to his/her injury; and finally that there was fault on the 
claimant’s part. A reduction will be made regardless of the difficulty 
ascertaining the exact scope of the contribution (Capps v Miller 
[1989] 1 WLR 839). In Vellino v Chief Constable of Greater Man-
chester [2001] EWCA Civ 1249 Sedley LJ, dissenting, considered 
that applying this defence is a far more appropriate tool for ensuring 
justice than applying a full defence to deny liability completely.9 While 
perhaps no longer needed in light of the changes to the illegality 
defence in Gray, this view has force as if the defendant is not liable 
for the full extent of the injury, it is justifiable to limit damages to the 
extent to which they are, but the fault of the defendant is still recog-
nised by still requiring compensation.
In conclusion, even though the injury may be the defendant’s fault, it 
is right that defences are applied to deny the claimant compensation. 
However, relying more on contributory negligence at the expense of 
the full defences would better strike the required balance between 
recognising the defendant’s fault while also taking account of the 
claimant’s own role in events.
8 This shows that you are 
aware of the change brought 
about by the Act more 
succinctly than giving a fuller 
account of the background to 
the defence. You can then get 
on more quickly to how the 
defence operates.
9 Include this as an option for 
the purposes of assessing 
whether the justice system 
could be better served in this 
way rather than having the 
current different defences. If 
you agree with the proposition 
it will allow you to bring your 
answer together nicely and 
flow into your conclusion. 
If you don’t agree, mention 
this at the beginning of this 
section before explaining why 
it is not a better approach.

  Question 1
  Question 1
Mick had recently purchased a new sports car and, feeling excited, took it out to see how 
fast he could get it to go. Having got the car up to 90 mph, he saw something in the road 
and slammed on the brakes. Unfortunately, he lost control and hit the central reservation.
An ambulance arrived and rushed him to Keefstone Hospital where his condition was 
stabilised. However, following the operation, a nurse from the hospital failed to rehydrate 
Mick sufficiently, which left him weaker than he would have been.
Subsequently, because of a pre-existing condition which Mick had, a complication developed 
which required further major surgery. Owing to his increased weakened state, Mick suffered 
a heart attack. The evidence shows that the heart attack could have been naturally caused 
because of the trauma of the second surgery, but this is inconclusive; in any event, his 
weakened state would have heightened the risk of this occurring.
Advise Mick as to whether he has a claim in negligence for his injuries.
Answer plan
➜ Confirm the existence of a duty of care owed by the hospital.
➜ Explain whether, and if so how, it has been breached.
➜ Evaluate the difficulty Mick may face with regard to causation and the non-applicability of 
the ‘but for’ test.
➜ Discuss whether regardless of the lack of firm evidence Mick could still prove causation.
➜ Consider whether the heart attack is too remote from the breach.
➜ Discuss whether there is a possible defence because of Mick’s own negligence in speeding 
initially.

Answer
In advising Mick on his action for negligence, the rules relating to 
causation will need particular focus as, on the traditional rules, it 
seems as if the hospital’s act is not the factual cause of his injury.1 
However, it will be argued that Mick’s case may warrant a relaxation 
of these rules and he is likely to be successful in his claim.
The first aspect of negligence which needs to be satisfied is that the 
hospital must have owed Mick a duty of care. As this is not a novel 
situation, precedent must be relied on to determine the matter, which 
clearly shows in this situation a duty is owed: for example, Bailey v 
Ministry of Defence [2008] EWCA Civ 883 which is factually similar 
to Mick’s case.2 Therefore, the hospital can be said to have owed 
Mick a duty of care in relation to his operation and the subsequent 
treatment which would follow.3
Once a duty is imposed, it then needs to have been breached. This 
occurs when the defendant’s conduct falls below a reasonable stand-
ard. Here it will need to be shown that the standard of the operation 
and aftercare was unreasonable owing to a failure to sufficiently rehy-
drate Mick following the operation.4 Mick should be advised that there 
are two legal questions to ask: what is the required standard and, on 
the facts, does the conduct fall short of the standard? In terms of the 
first question, the legal standard is normally to take such care as is 
reasonable in the circumstances (Paris v Stepney BC [1951] AC 
367) and determined objectively. However, when the issue is one of 
professional negligence, as is the case here in dealing with a surgical 
operation, the standard is altered to take account of the professional 
status of the defendant (Bolam v Friern Hospital Management 
Committee [1957] 1 WLR 582), regardless of their level of expe-
rience (Wilsher v Essex AHA [1988] AC 1074).5 Mick should be 
advised that the standard required becomes whether the defendant 
acted with the level of skill and competency expected of someone 
undertaking the activity in question. Therefore, the question is simply 
whether a reasonable nurse would have provided the level of rehydra-
tion which was given to Mick. While we are not told whether others 
would have provided the same level of rehydration, owing to the risks 
brought by the level provided and following a major operation, it is 
unlikely to be the standard of a reasonable nurse.
1 As there can be a lot 
of issues surrounding a 
negligence problem question, 
spell out the key issues within 
the scenario early to show 
that you have fully understood 
the question.
2 The Caparo test only applies 
to novel situations and, 
therefore, you should not 
mention it when you have a 
scenario which is covered 
by precedent, as it suggests 
you do not fully understand 
its operation. While there are 
more long-standing authorities 
for the point, factually the 
situation is the same as Bailey 
so you can justifiably use 
Bailey, which is then easier 
when you refer to it again.
3 Make sure that you explain 
what the duty of care in 
the instant case is and the 
extent of that duty, because 
this will be relevant in terms 
of determining breach and 
whether the damage is too 
remote.
4 So that you can fully explore 
whether there has been a 
breach, you need to highlight, 
out of the facts, what 
the potential act is which 
breached the duty.
5 Even though the question 
does not mention the extent 
of the nurse’s experience, 
show that you are aware of 
the potential issue by advising 
Mick briefly how this will not 
affect his claim.

69
  Question 1
If a breach is found,6 the next issue to advise Mick on is whether this 
left him so significantly weakened as to cause or materially contribute 
to his heart attack7 (Bailey). Normally, causation is determined on 
the balance of probabilities by reference to the ‘but for’ test8 (Cork 
v Kirby Maclean [1952] 2 All ER 402): ‘but for’ the negligent rehy-
dration would the injury have been suffered? On the facts this cannot 
be said to be so, as the heart attack may have been caused through 
non-negligent means, the trauma of the second9 operation. However, 
this is a cumulative cause scenario whereby, because of evidential 
difficulties, the ‘but for’ test is not applied. Under Bonnington Cast-
ings Ltd v Wardlaw [1956] AC 613, provided there is a negligent 
contribution which is more than negligible, it will suffice as a causative 
factor. While the hospital may claim that the evidence here does not 
even show that the lack of hydration made any contribution to the 
heart attack, this may not matter. The Wardlaw principle was devel-
oped in McGhee v National Coal Board [1973] 1 WLR 1 so that 
causation can be satisfied where the evidence shows the negligence 
caused a material increase in the risk of the harm suffered. This is 
the situation here as we are told that the risk of the heart attack was 
‘heightened’10 by Mick’s increased weakened state that resulted from 
the rehydration failure. It was doubted, following Wilsher, that this 
relaxation of the causation rules would apply to medical negligence 
cases and instead was limited to industrial cases. However, following 
Bailey the distinction is between distinct, independent causes as 
in Wilsher, or cumulative causes as in Wardlaw. It was held that 
there was no sufficient policy reason for not applying the relaxed rules 
for the latter scenario even where it is medical negligence. On the 
authority of Bailey, and especially in light of the similarities, it would 
appear that there is sufficient factual causation.
Even if the breach was the factual cause of Mick’s injury, it must 
also be the legal cause. This means that the injury suffered must be 
of a type which was reasonably foreseeable (Wagon Mound No. 1 
[1961] AC 388) and not too remote. Arguably, this is satisfied here as 
a heart attack is a foreseeable occurrence in such incidents and could 
be said to show that a duty is recognised in this situation.11 The fact 
that Mick was suffering a pre-existing condition which necessitated 
the second operation will also not matter as an ‘eggshell skull’ rule 
applies in negligence (Smith v Leech Brain & Co. Ltd [1962] 2 
QB 405), meaning that the hospital must take Mick as they find him. 
6 As this part of the claim is 
inconclusive at this stage, 
and you are offering advice, 
emphasise that this aspect 
is conditional on the previous 
requirement. This will also 
illustrate your understanding 
by showing that you are 
not making firm opinions 
when the evidence does not 
necessarily confirm the view.
7 This is the main focus of this 
question so you should factor 
in most time for this part of 
your answer.
8 Even if you recognise 
straightaway that this is not a 
‘but for’ scenario, you should 
follow a logical progression 
through what the law 
requires. Therefore, set out 
how this normally applies first 
rather than jumping to the 
relaxed rules.
9 As there have been two 
operations, identify which one 
is in issue here, particularly as 
the first operation appeared 
successful.
10 Quoting the facts will 
strengthen the suggestion 
that the principle applies.
11 By stating this, you allude 
to knowing the issues around 
the overlap between duty 
and damage since they are 
both based on foreseeability 
following the Wagon Mound 
(No. 1) case.

70
5  Negligence: Combined issue questions
Therefore, it appears that Mick would have a valid claim for negli-
gence; however, he should be advised that the hospital may seek to 
rely on the partial12 defence of contributory negligence; if successful, 
this would mean any compensation is reduced to take account of his 
own negligence. They may argue that the only reason Mick was in 
hospital was through his own negligence: speeding, which caused the 
initial crash. However, while Mick may satisfy the first requirement of 
Fookes v Slaytor [1979] 1 All ER 137 that the injury resulted from 
a risk which Mick exposed himself to, his negligence needs to con-
tribute to the injury suffered. The evidence does show that the heart 
attack was contributed to by his non-negligently caused weakened 
state following his operation and this could be traced back to him 
crashing his car. Therefore, this could be a contributing factor to his 
injury; however, Mick should be advised that as the injury occurred 
following the negligence and the second operation, not the operation 
following the crash, a contributory finding may be unlikely. Finally, 
the hospital must show negligence on Mick’s part which, as noted, is 
easily satisfied as he was speeding.
To conclude, Mick was owed a duty of care by the hospital which 
seems13 to have been breached; this is likely to be deemed to have 
caused the injury under the principle from McGhee. As this injury is 
not legally too remote, Mick is likely to succeed in his claim; however, 
this would be subject to a possible reduction for his own negligence 
in crashing his car initially.

appreciate this by stating it as 
you introduce it.

  Question 2
  Question 2
Alf and Bert are a pair of low-level criminals who specialise in home break-ins and carjackings. 
One day the pair had planned to steal a car by staging an accident. Alf pretended to collapse 
in the road as Eddie was approaching, and made out that he was having a heart attack. 
Panicking, Eddie slammed on the brakes, stopped and rushed out to help. As he did, Bert 
rushed out from behind a parked car and bundled Eddie over. Alf and Bert then jumped into 
the car. As Alf had recently learned to drive they had agreed that he would be the getaway 
driver. However, just as this was happening P.C. Wedgewood drove around the corner on patrol. 
Seeing as Eddie appeared OK, he gave chase after Alf and Bert.
Realising that the pair were being followed by the police Bert starting yelling at Alf, ‘Drive 
faster and lose the copper, you idiot!’ Alf sped up, but the pair started to bicker as to the best 
way of escaping and so neither was looking at where they were going. As such Alf did not 
see that he was coming up to a pedestrian crossing and sped through it without stopping. 
Reg was crossing the road at that point and dived out of the way. However, he landed 
awkwardly on his shoulder and elbow and due to an unknown condition suffered multiple 
fractures and permanent loss of mobility. A person without the condition would just have 
suffered bruising.
Eventually Alf took a corner at too much speed and lost control of the car. The car slid off the 
road and crashed into a lamppost on the near-side pavement. The lamppost made impact 
with the front passenger door causing severe injuries to Bert.
Advise Alf as to his liability for the injuries suffered by Reg and Bert.

following each incident. This will involve looking at the standard of 
care required by drivers and the impact on liability of the fact the 
injury occurred involving a stolen car.1 It will be argued that Alf has 
clearly breached the duty of care owed to Reg and Bert, and that this 
has caused each one injury. However, while he may have a defence 
against Bert due to the illegality of incident he will still be liable to Reg 
as the injury will not be deemed too remote.
As the car’s driver, Alf owes a duty of care to all other road users who 
may be reasonably foreseeably injured if care is not exercised (Lang-
ley v Dray [1998] PIQR P314).2 This duty covers both passengers 
and pedestrians and so the first element of negligence is satisfied.
The key question, however, is what standard is expected of Alf in order 
to discharge his duty, especially considering he has only recently passed 
his test and so has less experience than most drivers.3 Under Blyth 
v Birmingham Water Works Co. (1856) 11 Ex 781, the expected 
standard is determined objectively by assessing what the reasonable 
person would do in the situation; and the reasonable person possesses 
the standard of foresight which eliminates the idiosyncrasies of the per-
son whose conduct is in question. This means Alf’s inexperience is irrel-
evant and he will be judged by the same standard expected of someone 
with more experience (Nettleship v Weston [1971] 2 QB 691). This 
may seem unjust to inexperienced drivers; however, it is necessary in 
order to overcome the difficulties of determining an individual standard 
for each and every driver.4 Therefore, as held in Langley, Alf is expected 
to drive with such care and skill so as to avoid exposing other road users 
to unnecessary risk of injury. By speeding, not looking where he is going, 
driving through a red light and generally not paying attention it is clear 
that Alf has not met the standard of a reasonable driver.5 As such, Alf 
has breached the duty owed to both Reg and Bert.
The next consideration is whether each breach of duty was the cause 
of each injury. Causation is a question of fact whereby it is asked 
whether, on the balance of probabilities, the injuries would have hap-
pened ‘but for’ Alf’s breach (Cork v Kirby Maclean [1952] 2 All 
ER 402). This seems satisfied as, if Alf was not speeding and was 
1 When faced with a question 
which just says ‘Advise X’, it is 
worth spelling out in your first 
line that you have correctly 
identified the exact thing that 
you should be advising the 
person on.
2 As there is a precedent 
regarding the duty in this 
situation, there is no need to 
talk about Caparo.
3 While perhaps not the key 
question for liability in the 
question, it would be the key 
question for Alf personally, as 
for someone unfamiliar with 
the law; a natural response 
would be to highlight their 
lesser experience than the 
average motorist. This is 
why it warrants a bit more 
treatment than you might 
otherwise be inclined to give.
4 As this standard is 
detrimental to Alf’s chances 
of defeating the claim, you 
should advise him why this 
is the situation and, in doing 
so, you will show that you 
have more than a superficial 
knowledge of the law.
5 It is useful here to briefly 
remind the marker that you 
know what the scope of 
the duty owed is; you then 
need to draw on the facts to 
illustrate how it was breached. 
You can save time and not 
compromise your structure by 
dealing with duty and breach 
in relation to both Reg and 
Bert at the same time.

paying attention, he would not have lost control of the car and hit the 
lamppost thus injuring Bert. In relation to Reg, Alf could argue that 
his injuries were caused by Reg jumping out of the way.6 However, as 
jumping out of the way of an oncoming car is reasonably foreseeable, 
Alf should have sought to prevent Reg needing to do it, and clearly 
Reg would not have needed to if Alf was driving to a reasonable stand-
ard. As such, Reg’s actions will not be considered an intervening act.
The breach also needs to be the legal cause of the injuries meaning that 
the injuries were of a kind, type or class that were reasonably foresee-
able (Wagon Mound (No. 1) [1961] AC 388). Again there is no issue 
with this in relation to Bert’s injuries; these were clearly foreseeable due 
to how Alf was driving. However, Reg’s injuries were worse than would 
be expected due to an unknown condition. This means Alf needs to be 
advised of the ‘eggshell skull’ rule. This provides that the defendant 
must take the claimant as they find them and they will be liable for the 
entire harm caused, even where it is greater than expected owing to a 
particular condition of the claimant. This might seem at odds with the 
principle from Wagon Mound (No. 1), but it has been held to still apply 
(Smith v Leech Brain & Co. Ltd [1962] 2 QB 405). As the injury was 
a type which was still foreseeable, the fact that Reg’s condition meant 
the injury was far more severe will not limit liability.
In relation to Reg’s claim, the only possible defence that Alf could 
rely on would be the partial defence of contributory negligence.7 This 
reduces the amount of damages payable where just and equitable 
to reflect the level of negligent contribution to the injury made by the 
claimant (Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945, s. 1). For 
Reg to be negligent using the pedestrian crossing he would need 
to have been forbidden to cross at that time due to, for example, 
pedestrians having a red light. However, the facts suggest that Alf 
should have stopped and if that was the case, on top of his speeding, 
it would seem unlikely that Reg was negligent here.8
Alf should have more chance avoiding liability in negligence9 against 
Bert. Under section 149 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, Alf will not be able 
to claim that Bert voluntarily assumed the risk of such injury by getting 
in a car which was being used as a getaway vehicle.10 However, where 
Alf may have success is in relying on the full defence of illegality which 
absolves Alf of all liability. The wider form of the defence, as identified 
by Gray v Thames Trains Ltd [2009] UKHL 33, applies where the 
compensation is sought as a consequence of the claimant’s own illegal 
6 Take them in this order 
as Bert is a more clear-cut 
situation whereas there is a 
bit more to say on Reg.
7 Normally, because this is 
only a partial defence, it 
should be dealt with last; 
however, as there is no 
question of the full defences 
applying it makes sense 
to deal with it first as it 
follows on from the previous 
paragraph and allows you to 
finish with Reg. There will be 
more success against Bert so 
you can then clearly focus on 
that in detail.
8 We do not have much detail 
in the facts to support this 
discussion so take care to 
read what you have been 
given and draw on what you 
can to construct as good an 
argument as you can.
9 Obviously, there are other 
actions which Alf may face to 
which the following may not 
apply so it is worth clarifying 
the scope of the application of 
the defences.
10 As the section will bar the 
application of the defence, 
there is no more that needs 
to be said other than this. Do 
not go on and explain what 
the defence involves, let alone 
apply the requirements to 
the scenario, as it will be a 
pointless exercise.

  Question 2
act. The question is whether the criminal act caused the injury, or simply 
provided the opportunity for it to occur with the tortious act being the 
immediate cause. This seems more of a case of the former and this is 
supported by Ashton v Turner [1981] QB 137 which also concerned an 
injury suffered by the passenger in a getaway vehicle. As Lord Hoffmann 
noted in Gray,11 allowing recovery in such circumstances would offend 
public notions of the fair distribution of resources. Even though Alf 
lost control and was at fault for the injury, it would be permissible to 
deny recovery by Bert. If a court were to hold that the claim was not 
substantially based on the crime, Alf should be advised that he may be 
successful in pleading contributory negligence on the part of Bert.12 In 
terms of what reduction would be made, Alf should be advised that under 
the Act damages cannot be reduced by 100 per cent even if it was Bert’s 
idea to take the car and drive in that way (Pitts v Hunt [1991] 1 QB 24).
In conclusion,13 Alf should be advised that he owed both Reg and Bert 
a duty of care which was clearly breached. As those breaches caused 
the injuries, he would be liable notwithstanding that the extent of Reg’s 
injuries were worse than could have been foreseen. However, owing 
to the illegality of the situation, Alf will have a defence against Bert.

as to who said what you are 
about to advance from the 
case as it shows greater 
knowledge.
12 Even if you think that the 
illegality defence would 
certainly apply, you should 
still discuss this, as there is a 
possibility the other defence 
would not be applied. Further, 
by doing so you show that 
you know not only about this 
issue, but also how it relates

  Question 3
Paddy Chandler was a long-term alcoholic and was recently told that, owing to his lifestyle, 
he only had about a 45 per cent chance of living more than three years. After an unexpected 
bet came off, he decided to check himself into the Ladbroke Hills Private Medical Centre for 
a liver transplant in order to prolong his life expectancy. Prior to the operation he had spoken 
to Dr Done, an employed doctor at the Centre, who talked him through the procedure that 
would be used. Reflecting the seriousness of the situation, a new and innovative procedure 
was to be used which, while not having wide-scale endorsement, has been supported by a 
leading expert in the field in a national medical journal.
However, because he believed that Paddy really ought to have the operation, Dr Done chose 
not to inform Paddy that the operation carried with it a 5 per cent risk that the new liver may 
not be accepted by his body, which could result in death.
Following the operation, it became apparent that the new liver had not been accepted and 
Paddy was informed that with some medication the condition could be managed, but he 
would only have a 20 per cent chance of living longer than three years. Paddy has indicated 
that, if he had been informed, he might not have gone ahead with the operation.
Advise Paddy as to whether he has a successful negligence action against the medical centre.

  Question 3
Answer plan
➜ Explain quickly how a duty of care is owed by the Centre in this situation and set out the full 
scope of the duty.
➜ Identify the two potential breaches and deal with each, assessing whether they were 
breached.
➜ Explain how, even if the duty with regard to the operation procedure was breached, it is 
non-actionable.
➜ Apply the causation rules to the personal autonomy breach and explain how the approach is 
taken by the courts.
➜ Address any appropriate defences that the Centre may have.
Answer
In advising Paddy as to whether he has a claim against the Centre 
in negligence, the full extent of the duty owed by the Centre will be 
established and then the two possible ways any action may be taken 
will be considered. It will be argued that while it would appear that 
he has not suffered any actionable injury, merely a lost chance of 
living more than three years, the presence of the issue of personal 
autonomy in the matter means that he should have some basis for 
succeeding in any action.1
The first point to establish is that authorities such as Cassidy v 
Ministry of Health [1951] 2 KB 343 clearly show that through the 
doctor–patient relationship the Centre will vicariously2 owe a duty of 
care to Paddy when treating and operating on him. It is also important 
to advise Paddy that there is an additional aspect to the duty which 
is to warn Paddy of any significant risks involved (Montgomery v 
Lanarkshire Health Board [2015] UKSC 11). This duty has long 
been recognised as important (Sidaway v Board of Governors of 
2 By inserting this word, and 
after citing Cassidy, you 
show that you are aware 
of the applicability of the 
doctrine of vicarious liability 
to this situation, without 
getting sidetracked by a fuller 
explanation of it.
1 It is important to highlight 
early that you have spotted 
that this is not simply a loss of 
chance problem scenario and 
that in fact it is arguably more 
to do with Chester v Afshar 
[2004] UKHL 41. To avoid 
your answer getting messy, 
clearly separate out the two 
issues and then explain to the 
reader this is what you are 
doing so they know and thus 
do not lose track of what you 
are saying by trying to work 
out why you are saying it.

78

the Bethlehem Royal Hospital [1985] AC 871) even though the 
view of how it operates has altered over time.3
The next issue, therefore, is whether the duty owed to Paddy was 
breached by the Centre. In taking the duty covering the actual per-
formance of the operation, the standard must be that of the level of 
skill and competency expected of a person undertaking that activ-
ity and with the level of skill that the defendant professes to have 
(Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee [1957] 1 WLR 
582). While Paddy may argue that the new procedure is not widely 
endorsed, this is not necessary. Provided the Centre can show that Dr 
Done acted in accordance with a respectable body of medical opinion, 
which can withstand logical scrutiny (Bolitho v City and Hackney 
Health Authority [1997] 3 WLR 1151), this standard will be deemed 
to have been reached. The fact that a leading expert has supported 
the procedure in a national journal would suggest that the procedure 
was in line with a respectable body of opinion.
Paddy would have a problem though in that, even if it is accepted the 
use of this new procedure was negligent, he has suffered no action-
able injury. Prior to the operation, he only had a 45 per cent chance 
of living over three years. After the operation he had a 20 per cent 
chance. Therefore, this makes his position near identical to that in 
Gregg v Scott [2005] 2 AC 176 where the House of Lords held that 
the claimant in fact lost nothing as, on the balance of probabilities, the 
outcome in question would not have happened, there was no chance 
to lose. Further, it was held that a reduction in the chance itself should 
not be an actionable head of injury.4
However, as explained, the scope of the Centre’s duty was wider 
than merely carrying out the operation in a non-negligent manner. 
It extended to warning Paddy of the risks which the operation entailed. 
It was noted in Montgomery that the importance of personal auton-
omy has increased in line with patients no longer being seen as  
passive recipients of medical care and more as consumers with 
greater levels of medical knowledge themselves.5 Therefore, to dis-
charge the duty a doctor must take reasonable care to ensure that 
the patient is aware of any material risks involved in any recom-
mended treatment, and of any reasonable alternatives. Paddy should 
be advised that whether a 5 per cent risk is material is dependent on 
whether a reasonable person in his position would attach significance 
3 By including this part of 
the sentence you can show 
your knowledge of the 
principle and how long it has 
been recognised while also 
demonstrating that you are 
aware that the reasoning 
in Sidaway has now been 
departed from; you can then 
explain that in more detail in 
the more appropriate place 
later on in your answer.
4 Even if you strongly conclude 
that the use of the procedure 
was non-negligent, it is 
worth adding an additional 
paragraph on this point –  
to show that you have 
recognised that there is a 
similarity here to Gregg, but 
that you understand the legal 
position and, therefore, that 
an action by Paddy on this 
basis would not work.
5 As you are discussing how 
the law has moved on and 
changed in relation to what 
needs to be shown, it is 
beneficial to explain why the 
change arose. You can then 
comment on its justification.

79
  Question 3
to it and Dr Done could justify non-disclosure of the risk if it would 
have been seriously detrimental to Paddy’s health to inform him of 
the risk. Therefore, more information as to why the decision was 
made and what Paddy may have done with the information is needed. 
Ultimately though, while the facts suggest that Dr Done was acting 
to ensure a needed operation occurred, reflecting the emphasis on 
patients’ rights and informed consent, it is likely that the failure to 
inform Paddy will be deemed a breach.
Paddy should then be advised that the breach of the duty to inform 
must then be deemed to have caused the injury suffered. As stated, 
his injury is simply a non-actionable reduction in his chance of 
survival. Even proceeding on the basis that the injury was the 
lost ability to make an informed choice that has some difficulties 
because on conventional principles it must be shown that, on the 
balance of probabilities, ‘but for’ the negligence, the injury would not 
have occurred. The issue here is that Paddy may well have proceeded 
and, therefore, the risk would still have materialised, and the breach 
would not be the factual cause of the injury. Even if he would not 
have proceeded, the risk here was not created by the breach but 
was present regardless and notwithstanding how the operation 
was performed.6 However, as Lord Steyn accepted in Chester after 
referring to the academic work of Professor Honoré,7 the situation 
which Paddy finds himself in cannot be fitted within normal causation 
principles, but policy and corrective justice support vindicating his 
personal autonomy. Otherwise, the duty owed would be stripped of 
its content and would, in Lord Hope’s view in Chester, be particularly 
useless for a patient like Paddy who cannot say what they would have 
done if they had been properly advised.8
Therefore, while it could be argued that factually the injury was not 
caused by the breach of the duty to warn, as Lord Hope highlighted, 
the injury was caused in the legal sense. It is on this basis that there 
would not appear to be any issues regarding remoteness of damage, 
namely that the injury was a kind, type or class that was reasonably 
foreseeable (Wagon Mound (No. 1) [1961] AC 388). The injury suf-
fered was the failure of the new liver to be accepted by Paddy’s body, 
the risk of which, as in Chester,9 was exactly what he should have 
been informed of by Dr Done.
6 By highlighting this you 
further distance this part of 
your answer from the previous 
discussion, as it shows that 
passing the Bolam test has 
no bearing on this aspect of 
Paddy’s situation.
7 Professor Honoré was cited 
by both Lord Steyn and 
Lord Hope in the majority in 
Chester in support of their 
opinions; therefore, a small 
reference such as this allows 
you to demonstrate your 
knowledge of their opinions 
and the wider academic 
thinking on this issue.
8 In the latter part of this 
sentence, use the facts from 
the question to identify Paddy 
with the reasoning of Lord 
Hope to make your application 
stronger as well as, again, 
showing an in-depth 
knowledge of the judicial 
reasoning which impacts on 
this point.
9 Refer to Chester to reinforce 
your argument that legally the 
breach should be seen as the 
cause of an actionable injury, 
i.e. the lost autonomy.

80
5  Negligence: Combined issue questions
Finally, Paddy should be advised that there does not appear to be any 
defences which the Centre could rely on to counter any claim. The 
only possible argument10 would be that his alcoholism put him in a 
position whereby he needed treatment and, therefore, this behaviour 
makes him contributorily negligent. However, following St George v 
Home Office [2008] EWCA Civ 1068, as this was a lifestyle choice 
made prior to the creation of the duty of care, it cannot be considered 
for the purposes of reducing any compensation.
In conclusion, while there may be causation issues in Paddy’s situ-
ation, there has been a clear breach of the Centre’s duty to inform 
Paddy of the operation’s risk. This denial of personal autonomy 
should, on the basis of cases such as Montgomery and Chester,11 
mean that Paddy would have an action for this loss.
10 Your aim here is to just 
briefly raise the possibility, 
reflecting your awareness 
of the similar facts between 
Paddy’s situation and that in 
St. George. This also shows 
that you understand the point 
by applying it in dismissal of 
the potential argument by the 
Centre.

  Question 4
  Question 4
Owing to a recent flurry of burglaries in the area, a group of local residents decided to form a 
neighbourhood watch team. The purpose of the team was to set up a patrol around the area 
to act as a deterrent by approaching people who looked up to no good and to contact the 
police at the first hint of any criminal activity.
One of the members, Brandon, had that day gone away for the night and, having realised he 
had left a downstairs window open, sent a text to Mac, a friend but non-member, asking him 
to close it for him. However, Mac was busy getting ready to go out and thought there would 
be nothing to worry about as the neighbourhood watch patrol would go past Brandon’s 
house regularly and it was only one night.
That evening, it was Keith’s turn to do the patrol. Keith had already worked a long day at the 
factory where he was employed and so was tired. As he approached Brandon’s house he 
saw someone climbing through the window but just wanting to get home to watch TV he did 
nothing, thinking it was just someone who had locked themselves out.
The next day, Brandon returned home to see his house had been burgled with all of his 
belongings taken. The burglar has never been caught.
Brandon now seeks your advice as to whether he could bring a claim against Mac or Keith 
as he holds them responsible for what happened.

Answer plan
➜ Set out the general position regarding omissions and deal with Mac’s potential liability first.
➜ Consider if there is an assumption of responsibility by Mac towards Brandon which warrants 
imposing a positive duty to act.
➜ If so, assess whether the duty was breached and confirm the other elements of negligence.
➜ Assess the potential liability of Keith on the same basis.
Answer
The issue to determine is whether Brandon has a claim in negligence 
even though Mac and Keith have not performed any positive acts. This 
is important, as usually the law only permits this in limited situations 
and thus, if they do not fit those, Brandon will be left without redress 
for his loss. It will be argued that Mac does not owe a duty but Keith 
may well be held liable.
As indicated, the general position in negligence is that a duty of care 
will not be imposed in relation to omissions (Smith v Littlewoods 
Organisation [1987] 1 AC 241). It is clear in relation to Mac that this 
is a case of a pure omission as opposed to being a failure to act as 
part of a wider positive course of conduct, such as not stopping at a

  Question 4
red light, which will carry a duty.1 Mac received the text message but 
clearly omitted to do anything about it and so this is the former cate-
gory and within the general rule. However, exceptions to this position 
were outlined by Lord Goff in Smith. Of these, the most likely to be 
applicable is that Mac assumed responsibility for Brandon’s property. 
Brandon could argue that by asking Mac to close the window and 
highlighting the present danger a duty should be imposed. However, 
Brandon should be advised that this is unlikely to be accepted as 
there was no confirmation by Mac that he would do so. Had Mac 
done so, then a duty would be present, as Brandon would have had 
trust and confidence in Mac’s words, which would justify a finding of 
an assumption of responsibility. In the absence of a reply confirming 
he would act, the political reason given by Lord Hoffmann in Stovin 
v Wise [1996] AC 923 for not imposing a duty for omissions is not 
addressed. The reason is that it is a greater invasion of a person’s 
freedom to compel them to act than it is to require them to take care 
of others when they have chosen to embark on a course of con-
duct.2 This can only be justified when there is an element of proximity 
between the parties which their friendship alone is unlikely to create.
Brandon should be advised, however, that he may be more successful 
in a claim against Keith. While, again, this is a case of a pure omis-
sion, the reason for the greater likelihood of success is that Keith is 
a member of the neighbourhood watch patrol and was meant to be 
keeping an eye out for burglars that night. By accepting this role, Keith 
assumed responsibility towards those residents who are covered by 
the patrol, which includes Brandon. As such, the political reason stated 
above is overcome; he has volunteered to act and failed to do so.3 The 
moral reason advanced by Lord Hoffmann for not imposing a duty is 
also satisfied. This is based on the idea that there could be an indeter-
minate class of potential defendants in an omission situation, raising 
the question of why it is justifiable to pick out the actual defendant for 
liability. However, here, as Keith was performing the patrol that night, 
it is morally right to pick him out for liability over others.
Those factors which suggest an assumption of liability also suggest 
that the tripartite Caparo test4 for imposing a duty is satisfied here. It is 
clearly foreseeable that, if Keith omitted to approach the person climbing 
through the window, at the time of widespread burglaries, harm could 
be caused to the property in question. While it was stated in Smith that 
mere foreseeability is not sufficient to create a duty to prevent criminal 
1 The point is to show that you 
are aware of the distinction 
between the two, and using 
the facts to confirm what we 
are dealing with here. This 
is important as the law does 
impose duties in the latter 
type of situation.

explaining why Brandon is 
unlikely to succeed in making 
a claim against someone. As 
the point of the question is 
to advise him on the law, you 
have to make sure you state 
the reasons why he would not 
have a claim. If you imagine 
him in front of you, he would 
be asking why not, so tell 
him.
3 Whereas before you were 
highlighting how the reasons 
were not satisfied, now you 
need to use the facts to 
show how they have been 
overcome, as this is what will 
justify the courts imposing a 
duty on Keith.
4The presence of an 
assumption of responsibility 
will generally warrant 
imposing a duty of care; 
however, the same facts 
would also generally satisfy 
the Caparo test. A negative 
finding of an assumption 
of responsibility does not 
preclude reference being 
made to Caparo and so it is 
worth highlighting it here to 
reinforce why you feel Keith 
is likely to owe a duty in this 
situation.

acts by a third party, the facts indicate that the key requirement of 
proximity exists between Brandon, as a resident under the patrol’s remit, 
and Keith who was undertaking the patrol. These factors combined, by 
addressing the policy concerns for imposing a duty, mean that it would 
be fair, just and reasonable to impose a duty on Keith.
As it seems likely that Keith will owe duty of care, Brandon now 
needs advising as to whether the rest of the elements for a claim 
in negligence are satisfied.5 By not doing anything when he saw the 
person climbing through the window, it would seem apparent that 
Keith failed to reach the standard of care expected of a reasonable 
person: the likelihood of harm was increased and thus Keith should 
have approached the person, or at least contacted the police, as that 
was part of the patrol’s remit.
‘But for’ this breach, Brandon’s loss of property would also not have 
occurred. If he had approached the person and/or called the police, 
the incident would have been prevented or the person apprehended 
and, therefore, the causal link required is established. While usu-
ally the deliberate wrongdoing of a third party will be deemed an 
independent cause of the loss (Weld-Blundell v Stephens [1920] 
AC 956) exceptionally, where for example the duty in question is to 
prevent that third party from doing the wrong, as here, it shall not be 
classed as an intervening act (Dorset Yacht Club v Home Office 
[1970] AC 1004). The scope of the duty also means there is not any 
issue of remoteness. Here the loss suffered by Brandon is stolen 
property and so it is of a type that was reasonably foreseeable as 
required by Wagon Mound (No. 1) [1967] 1 AC 617.
However, Brandon should be advised that, if successful, any compen-
sation received may well be reduced on the grounds of contributory 
negligence. This is because he was aware of the danger of being 
burgled by leaving his window open, as shown by his text to Mac. 
However, it is unlikely that any of the full defences6 to a negligence 
claim can be relied on by Keith.
In conclusion, Brandon should be advised that he is unlikely to suc-
ceed with any claim against Mac, as this is a situation of a pure 
omission for which the law does not generally impose duties. Owing 
to the lack of proximity between the two, the policy reasons for the 
law’s approach are not surmounted. However, Keith’s position in the 
patrol is likely to have created an assumption of responsibility which 
5 The duty of care is only 
one part of negligence and, 
while this is the focus of the 
question, it is important that 
you cover all the aspects, 
although naturally these will 
not need as much depth.
6 By this stage of your answer, 
if you have time, you could 
name the defences but it 
is not necessary. As they 
are clearly not applicable 
to Keith, there certainly is 
no need to discuss them in 
detail. Therefore, by treating 
them like this, you show 
that you understand the full 
extent of them, which is more 
important than showing that 
you simply know them.

  Question 5
justifies a duty being imposed on him. As the other negligence factors 
are present, this means that a claim against Keith should succeed.
  Question 5
Donald is a law student who was due to sit his final exam. As long as he passed the exam 
he had been assured of a pupillage at a prestigious barristers’ chambers. As he did not 
want to risk being late by using public transport, Donald chose to drive to the exam. Donald 
passed his test the year before, but had not driven much as he lacked confidence driving on 
busy roads and he was conscious of setting off his anxiety problem. On the day of his exam 
though, he felt there was more risk in not driving.
On his journey, Donald stalled at a busy junction and consequently was the victim of road rage 
from another driver. Donald started to feel more and more anxious, but carried on driving so 
as not to be late for the exam. However, he ended up having a full-blown panic attack which 
caused him to drive, at speed, into the back of a car driven by Nigel who had had stopped at a 
red light. Nigel suffered a broken leg and also hit his head against the side of his car.
Nigel was taken to the Clintonville General Hospital and seen by Dr Hilary. Dr Hilary was a jun-
ior doctor with no specialism in head and brain injuries; however, due to a lack of experienced 
staff there was no one present who could assist in performing the appropriate assessment. As

Nigel was conscious, Dr Hilary felt that the trauma to Nigel’s head was unlikely to have caused 
any significant head injury and so decided to treat his broken leg first rather than sending him 
for a CT scan. This was in fact contrary to the official NHS guidelines and an experienced doc-
tor would have appreciated the need to have a scan immediately. Subsequently, Nigel suffered 
a seizure due to suffering internal bleeding in the brain which would have been revealed by a 
CT scan. His condition continued to worsen and Nigel ended up in a vegetative state.

  Question 5
Answer
The issue regarding Nigel’s injuries concerns the interrelationship 
between Donald’s acts and the hospital’s and application of the law 
on intervening acts. This is important to determine as it will impact 
on the level of liability which may be imposed on both parties. It will 
be argued that, as the action of Dr Hilary was an independent event, 
it will break the chain of causation with regard to Donald’s liability.
First, as a motorist, Donald owes a duty of care to other road users 
such as Nigel (Langley v Dray (1998) PIQR P314).1 The question 
is whether this duty to Nigel was breached. The standard of care to 
be exercised is that of the reasonable competent driver regardless 
of their level of experience and, therefore, it is irrelevant that Donald 
had not long passed his test and had driven little in that time (Net-
tleship v Weston [1971] 2 QB 691). The fact that Donald hit Nigel 
‘at speed’2 despite approaching a red light suggests a clear breach. 
However, Donald’s situation is complicated by his anxiety attack 
before the accident, as this could be classed as a disabling event 
which would affect the level of care and skill expected of him. The 
case of Mansfield v Weetabix Ltd [1998] 1 WLR 1263 involved 
a driver who suffered a medical condition that impaired his driving 
ability, leading to a crash,3 which seems to be4 what happened here. 
The court held that there was no reason in principle why a per-
son should not be deemed negligent where the disabling event was 
gradual, as opposed to a sudden event, provided they were unaware 
of the condition. As such, it is in fact of little help to Donald5 as he 
knew of his condition as this was why he had little driving experience. 
That knowledge compounds his decision to continue driving despite 
feeling ‘more and more anxious’. If Donald was not having an anxiety 
attack at the time of the crash and he was going at an appropriate 
speed he may avoid being found in breach. More information is obvi-
ously needed in this regard; however, based on what we have been 
told it would seem that Donald would be in breach of his duty of care 
to Nigel due to Mansfield, irrespective of the speed he was travelling 
at when approaching the red light.
If Donald is held in breach of his duty,6 applying the standard ‘but for’ 
test from Cork v Kirby Mclean [1952] 2 All ER 402, on the balance 
of probabilities, ‘but for’ Donald’s negligence, he would not have hit 
1 Remember; as with previous 
answers, where a precedent 
exists, there is no need to talk 
about Caparo.
2 Make sure that you highlight 
that you are using the facts of 
the question to substantiate 
your point.
3 State enough of the facts to 
highlight the connection with 
Donald’s situation, but do not 
go into a full-blown account.
4 Strictly speaking, from the 
facts we do not know for 
certain that this was definitely 
the case and so you should 
not write this sentence as if 
it was.
5 It is still important to 
discuss the case in order to 
demonstrate your knowledge 
and understanding by 
applying it to the facts in order 
to rule out its applicability to 
Donald. Remember that cases 
and principles may be relevant 
to the discussion even if not 
ultimately applicable in terms 
of the likely outcome of the 
scenario.
6 While likely that he is, reflect 
the possible doubt in your 
choice of words.

5  Negligence: Combined issue questions
Nigel and caused those initial injuries. These injuries are also of a type 
which was reasonably foreseeable (Wagon Mound (No. 1) [1961] 
AC 388) thus they are not too remote. From the facts there would not 
seem to be any possible defence that Donald could rely on.
The issue, however, is the extent of Donald’s liability and whether he will 
be liable for Nigel’s ultimate condition and injury following the seizure. In 
negligence the defendant is liable for the reasonably foreseeable dam-
age caused by his breach. While it could be said Nigel was only in the 
hospital because of Donald’s alleged7 negligence, an act by a third party 
can break the chain of causation. For the court to make such a finding 
and limit the extent of Donald’s liability, the actions of Dr Hilary must not 
be a natural and probable consequence of Donald’s own act (Knightly 
v Johns [1982] 1 All ER 851) nor a foreseeable act (Lamb v Camden 
LBC [1981] QB 625). It appears that the internal bleeding would have 
been caused in the crash when Nigel hit his head and so his ultimate 
condition could well be viewed as a natural and probable consequence 
of Donald’s negligent driving. However, we are told that the seizure was 
caused by the continuing, untreated bleeding on Nigel’s brain. Negligent 
medical treatment can be said to be foreseeable, meaning Donald would 
be liable for the full extent of Nigel’s injuries. That said, Donald should 
be advised that where medical treatment is so grossly negligent so as to 
be an irresponsible treatment of the injury initially caused, the treatment 
would be an intervening act (Webb v Portsmouth Hospitals NHS 
Trust [2002] PIQR P8). Dr Hilary failing to follow official NHS protocols 
in relation to head traumas and check for injury in the circumstances 
can be considered to be below the standard of care to be expected by 
a medical professional.8 It could also said to be irresponsible treatment 
in that the hospital did not have specialist staff on duty who could have 
conducted the treatment in the appropriate manner. Donald should, 
therefore, be advised that the actions of Dr Hilary are likely to be seen 
as a new intervening act9 which would mean that he would not be liable 
for the subsequent injuries resulting from that intervention.
Therefore, the hospital needs to be advised as to its own liability to Nigel. 
A hospital owes a primary, non-delegable duty of care to all its patients 
(Gold v Essex County Council [1942] 2 KB 293) and so it does not 
matter what employment status Dr Hilary has within the hospital.10 As 
discussed above,11 the duty seems to have been breached. Even if the 
hospital were to argue a lower level of care is reasonable in light of 
Dr Hilary only being a junior doctor and having less experience, this 
7 By calling it ‘alleged’, you 
maintain consistency with 
your previous discussion. 
At this stage you will not 
have determined that it was 
negligence.
8 This is obviously the 
language to be used when 
discussing breach. You need 
to use it here because it 
is only a highly negligent 
breach of duty by the hospital 
which will break the chain of 
Donald’s liability.
9 You could use the Latin phrase 
if you know it but this will 
suffice. Arguably, it is better as 
it shows you understand what 
the Latin means.
10 By highlighting this you get 
to demonstrate your broader 
knowledge on no-delegable 
duties and vicarious liability 
without going off on a tangent. 
It also allows you to explain 
that a duty is owed briefly and 
enable you to focus more on 
the key issues of breach and 
intervening acts.
11 Normally, you would 
establish the duty first but in 
this instance it makes a sense 
to discuss the negligence on 
the part of the hospital prior 
to confirming the duty, as 
this is crucial to there being 
an intervening act for the 
purposes of Donald’s liability 
which necessitates looking at 
the hospital’s duty.

89
  Question 5
would not succeed due to Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority 
[1988] AC 1074. Further, there is unlikely to be a reasonable body of 
medical opinion which would have made the clinical decision of Dr Hilary 
in light of the official NHS guidelines on how to act in such a situation, 
and on that basis, certainly not one capable of withstanding logical 
scrutiny (Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority [1997] 3 
WLR 1151). There appear to be no issues surrounding causation or 
remoteness in relation to the hospital and as it would have no defence, 
the hospital would be liable in negligence for Nigel’s current state.
To conclude, Donald should be advised that he faces being held liable 
for damages reflecting the initial injuries suffered by Nigel. The chain 
of causation regarding Nigel’s condition was broken by the interven-
tion of Dr Hilary and so the hospital should be advised that they would 
be liable for the subsequent injuries. As these acts and the resulting 
injuries are more independent than concurrent, the Civil Liability (Con-
tribution) Act 1978 will not apply (Rahman v Arearose Ltd [2001] 
QB 351) and each party will be liable for the amount of compensation 
quantified to reflect the harm that they individually caused.12 How-
ever, Donald should be advised that the quantification of his amount 
of compensation will not be curtailed by the subsequent tort by the 
hospital if Nigel would have suffered any future, ongoing losses as a 
result of his negligence (Baker v Willoughby [1970] AC 467).
12 You will not be expected to 
offer a specific percentage 
for each, but your answer 
will be incomplete if you do 
not advise them as to how 
the court may go about 
apportioning their respective 
share of compensation. In real 
life, having advised them they 
face liability, this would be of 
real importance to them.

  Question 6
One afternoon, Henry, a delivery driver for Agnew Petroleum plc was driving his petrol tanker 
in rush hour traffic. Henry was tired and just wanting to get to his last stop and get home. 
Ignoring the extreme weather conditions and a recommendation that high-sided vehicles 
not use the motorway, Henry took the motorway as it was only one junction, driving over the 
speed limit to get off the motorway quicker. However, a gust of wind blew the tanker over, 
resulting in a multi-car pile-up, and the petrol caused a massive fire.
Geoffrey was watching the news at home. His nephew Monty, who Geoffrey has raised from 
a young boy, uses that road to drive home. Geoffrey thought he saw a car similar to Monty’s 
on the screen. After not hearing from Monty, Geoffrey rushed to the hospital to see if Monty 
was there. Two hours after seeing the incident on TV, Geoffrey is informed that Monty has 
been killed and is asked to identify the body. Owing to the number of patients, Monty’s body 
has not been cleaned up. Upon seeing Monty, Geoffrey suffers a nervous breakdown. Agnew 
Petroleum plc has admitted liability to anyone that they owed a duty to.
Sachin is a staff nurse at the hospital where the victims of the crash were brought. Although 
having a history of work-related stress, he has never been offered any counselling services 
since his return to work. On the day of the crash, having complained of already being on 
duty for 20 hours due to a previous emergency, Sachin was told he had to stay on shift and 
help with the accident victims. However, after working several more hours in such difficult 
conditions, Sachin collapsed and has been signed off work since with a stress-related 
mental illness.

➜ Geoffrey – establish that he is a secondary victim for the purposes of negligently inflicted 
psychiatric injury, and then work through each control mechanism in turn and apply it to the 
facts of the question.
➜ Sachin – identify that this is a different situation, being a stress-related illness, and work 
through the legal principles set out in Hatton v Sutherland [2002] EWCA Civ 276 which 
apply for this type of injury.
Answer
The issue to advise Geoffrey and Sachin about is whether they 
have satisfied the criteria required by the law in order to claim for 
negligently inflicted psychiatric injuries. They should be advised that 
this is a policy-influenced area, and control mechanisms are usually 
imposed to limit when a duty of care will be owed by the defendant, 
especially in Geoffrey’s situation. It will be argued that, whilst being a 
secondary victim and facing evidential difficulty in his claim, Geoffrey 
may still succeed on the facts. Sachin is also likely to be successful 
in his claim on the basis of the facts provided.

5  Negligence: Combined issue questions
In regards to Geoffrey’s claim, he should be advised that he will need 
to show that he was owed a duty of care. Following White v Chief 
Constable of South Yorkshire Police [1999] 2 AC 455, in order to 
be owed a duty as a primary victim of the alleged negligence, which 
has less restrictive requirements to satisfy,1 he must have been placed 
in physical danger through the defendant’s negligent act or at least 
have had grounds to reasonably fear for his physical safety. As Geof-
frey was not involved in the crash himself, this is not satisfied, there-
fore Geoffrey should be advised on the restrictive law for secondary 
victims governed by Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire 
[1992] 1 AC 310. Geoffrey must first have suffered a medically recog-
nised injury which occurred despite his being of ‘customary phlegm’ 
(Bourhill v Young [1943] AC 92). A nervous breakdown would sat-
isfy this requirement although we do not know if he is of reasonable 
fortitude.2 However, on the basis that he is, Geoffrey requires advice 
as to the Alcock control mechanisms.
First, the claimant needs a close tie of love and affection with 
an immediate victim of the incident, which here is Monty. This is 
required, as the claimant’s injury must be reasonably foreseeable to 
the person who caused the primary incident to warrant liability. The 
aim is to prevent an excess of claims and liability which is dispropor-
tionate to the conduct concerned. Geoffrey should be advised that 
such closeness is presumed between spouses and parent/child, but 
under Alcock other types of family relationships will not automatically 
be regarded as being sufficiently close. Therefore, Geoffrey will have 
to show evidence that he was sufficiently close to Monty, which may 
be difficult. However, Lord Ackner acknowledged that such closeness 
will be determined on a case-by-case basis and, therefore, the fact 
that Geoffrey is only Monty’s uncle may not prevent Geoffrey success-
fully claiming.3 That Geoffrey has raised Monty since he was young 
suggests the absence of Monty’s parents, and that Geoffrey has more 
of a parental relationship with Monty.
On the basis that Geoffrey satisfies the court of his closeness to 
Monty,4 the next issue is whether he has sufficient proximity in time 
and space to the incident. This means that Geoffrey must have per-
sonally been at the incident. This may be an issue here as initially 
Geoffrey only sees the crash on TV, which is not sufficient (Alcock). 
However, Geoffrey should be advised that coming across the imme-
diate aftermath of the incident with one’s own senses is sufficient 
1 In order to show the full 
range of your knowledge, 
you need to highlight the 
two types of victim and 
then establish which one 
Geoffrey will be. However, 
it is important to remember 
to highlight the significance 
of having each type of 
victim status, as this will 
demonstrate a greater level of 
knowledge and add structural 
sense as to why you have 
explained both.
2 Although ‘customary phlegm’ 
has been used before, phrasing 
it in this way for the second 
time will help demonstrate 
your understanding of what is 
meant.
3 It is vital that you do not just 
assume that simply because 
Geoffrey is not within the 
categories identified by the 
court as having a close tie 
of love and affection, he has 
no chance of claiming as 
that is not what the court 
actually determined in Alcock. 
You need to draw on the 
facts to support why he still 
may be able to satisfy the 
requirement.
4 Because we cannot 
conclusively establish whether 
the necessary closeness 
is present, you will need to 
phrase your next sentence in 
this way to explain why you are 
proceeding to the next control 
mechanism when the claim 
may well have already failed.

93
  Question 6
(McLoughlin v O’Brien [1983] 1 AC 410). Although in Alcock the 
claimant who identified his brother-in-law at the mortuary some eight 
hours after the incident was held not to have witnessed the immedi-
ate aftermath, Geoffrey should be advised that his situation is more 
analogous to the actual case of McLoughlin. In that case the mother 
was told at home of a crash involving her family, two hours after it 
had happened. Upon arriving at hospital, she was informed that one 
of her children was dead, which, together with seeing the extent of 
the injuries to the rest of her family, caused her to suffer psychiatric 
illness.5 Therefore, as Geoffrey saw Monty in the state that he would 
have been in at the roadside as in McLoughlin, and this was only two 
hours after the actual incident,6 Geoffrey should have the necessary 
immediacy to overcome this mechanism.
The final requirement of Alcock is in relation to the means with which 
his breakdown was caused.7 Psychiatric injury must be caused by per-
ceiving the incident or the immediate aftermath through one’s own 
senses, rather than merely being informed by a bystander. Although 
Geoffrey learned of Monty’s death from another party, we are not told 
exactly when the breakdown occurs. It appears to have occurred from 
the sudden shock of seeing Monty dead, as we are told he suffered the 
breakdown ‘upon seeing’ the body.8 Therefore, on the basis that he can 
satisfy the court that he had a sufficiently close tie of love and affection 
with Monty, Geoffrey should be able to make a successful claim.
Sachin’s situation is different, as are the legal principles governing it. 
Sachin should first be advised that psychiatric injury resulting from 
workplace stress is actionable, and is simply part of the employ-
er’s normal common law duty of care to their employees (Walker 
v Northumberland County Council [1995] 1 All ER 737). As an 
employee, Sachin is owed this duty. Even if the stress results from the 
strain of simply doing the job Sachin is employed to do, provided that 
the stress was foreseeable, there are no special control mechanisms 
and the injury is within the scope of the duty.9
The case of Hatton v Sutherland [2002] EWCA Civ 76 provides 
the governing principles for this situation. First, as noted above, the 
stress-related injury must be foreseeable. Importantly for Sachin, the 
injury need not be foreseeable in a person of ordinary fortitude, but 
foreseeable within him. This reflects that the duty is owed to the 
individual employee, and therefore, the employer should know about 
5 A brief account of the facts 
is required to lay the basis for 
arguing that Geoffrey’s case 
is more like McLoughlin than 
Alcock.
6 It is vital to use the facts 
within the question to 
support the argument being 
advanced.
7 Although there is the 
option of discussing the 
Alcock mechanisms in any 
order, it is advisable here 
(as opposed to, say, after the 
point of medically recognised 
injury), to deal with this one 
following the proximity in time 
and space, as the question 
suggests that the injury 
was caused by the shock of 
seeing the unclean body in 
the hospital and, therefore, it 
follows better from discussing 
how he needs to be at the 
scene or immediate aftermath.
8 Again, you need to draw 
on the facts to support your 
argument here as without 
the point about ‘upon 
seeing’ there is not a lot to 
substantiate the satisfaction 
of this requirement.
9 Take some time at the start 
of this section of your answer 
to set out the background 
of claims for stress and 
demonstrate that you 
appreciate that it is a different 
regime from the traditional 
claims for psychiatric injury.

5  Negligence: Combined issue questions
any particular vulnerability (Paris v Stepney BC [1951] AC 367). As 
Sachin has a demanding job, both intellectually and emotionally, the 
hospital should already be more alert to the signs of stress (Hatton).10 
Here, Sachin has also been complaining and has already had a period 
of leave owing to stress. Therefore, there are lots of signs pointing 
to this outcome, and in light of Sachin’s history this appears even 
more a foreseeable injury. As nothing seems to have been done to 
support Sachin since returning from the first injury, and on the basis 
that the injury was the result of stress at work, the issues of breach 
and causation appear satisfied. There can be no suggestion of con-
tributory negligence from Sachin carrying on his work (Young v Post 
Office [2002] IRLR 660).11
To conclude, both parties appear on the facts to have actionable 
claims, and a chance of succeeding in them. However, more evidence 
is likely to be required to fully determine that a duty of care was owed

  Question 7
  Question 7
Henry, a financial adviser, undertakes work for Clown’s Bank plc, although he also does 
independent work for himself. When he is doing work for Clown’s Bank, he is provided with 
an office and administrative staff; the bank also has control over the range of financial prod-
ucts he may offer and provides him with a basic wage plus bonuses. However, he does have 
the opportunity to make extra profits from any non-investment products that he sells to the 
customer and he can determine the level of risk to expose the customer to.
One night in the Ducker and Diver Arms public house, somewhere Henry is known to work 
out of when he is working late, Henry is approached by Gideon, whom he met through 
his work with the Bank. Gideon explains that he has inherited £1 million and requires 
investment advice. Henry explains that he has had six pints of strong Belgian lager and 
so is not really in the right frame of mind and tells Gideon to come to the Bank tomorrow. 
As Henry leaves he shouts back: ‘Royal Bank of Wales – that’s a company on the up; we’ll 
discuss them tomorrow.’
Thinking that this was Henry’s investment advice, and as he has always acted on his advice 
and never lost out, he decides to save time and rather than see Henry goes online and 
invests the whole sum in Royal Bank of Wales. Two weeks later the Royal Bank of Wales 
receives an urgent government bailout and their shares became worthless, with Gideon los-
ing his investment.
Gideon now seeks to sue Clown’s Bank for his economic loss, owing to what he feels was a 
negligent misstatement by Henry. Advise the Bank.

Answer plan
➜ Determine whether Henry is an employee acting in the course of his employment for vicari-
ous liability purposes.
➜ Evaluate whether there is an assumption of responsibility towards Gideon by Henry, by mak-
ing the statement that he did.
➜ Consider the social environment in which the statement is made.
➜ Discuss whether, in the event there is no assumption of responsibility, a duty towards 
Gideon may be found under the Caparo tripartite test.
Answer
The issue to be determined is whether Clown’s Bank vicariously owed 
a duty of care towards Gideon in relation to his economic losses. 
Such a finding would be financially significant and, despite the law’s 
reluctance to find such duties on policy grounds, there are instances 
where one will be found.1 However, it is argued that, while it is possible 
that they have responsibility for Henry, the situation is not such as to 
overcome the law’s policy concerns and warrant finding a duty.
First, it needs to be established whether the Bank is in fact respon-
sible for Henry’s acts if a duty of care is found. The Bank should be 
advised that they will be vicariously liable if it can be shown that Henry 
is an employee and was acting in the course of that employment 
1 Your point here is to show 
that you appreciate the 
practical consequences for 
the Bank of finding a duty 
in this situation as they 
are, effectively, your client. 
The other task is to give an 
indication of knowing the 
context within which the law 
operates, i.e. one limited on 
policy grounds, which you can 
then develop in the main body 
of your answer.

  Question 7
when he made the statement. Henry’s employment status is blurred 
by the fact that he works independently of the Bank as well as act-
ing for them. Historically, whether a person was an employee was 
determined by reference to the level of control that he was under.2 
However, this did not fully reflect emerging employment relationships, 
so an economic reality test was developed. This requires looking at 
the overall situation for evidence of a contract of service (Market 
Investigations Ltd v Minister of Social Security [1969] 2 QB 
173). This case proposed a non-exhaustive list of factors to consider, 
with control just being one. Others were whether the person provided 
their own equipment and hired their own staff and their degree of 
responsibility. Applying the factors to Henry, they suggest that he is 
likely to be classed as an employee. While Henry has some individual 
responsibility, he is provided with an office and administrative staff 
by the Bank who also dictate what he can offer clients; significantly, 
they pay his wages and bonuses. Therefore, overall, this suggests that 
there is a contract of service.
Henry, though, must have been in the course of his employment when 
he made the statement. However, it occurred in the evening, in a pub, 
after Henry had been drinking. The test to apply is the close-connec-
tion test from Lister v Hesley Hall [2002] 1 AC 215. This requires 
the tort to be so closely connected with the employment that it is fair 
and just to hold the Bank vicariously liable. Henry met Gideon through 
his employment with the Bank and the tort is allegedly3 in making a 
negligent misstatement to a client regarding a financial investment 
which is what he is employed to give; the fact that Gideon was told to 
visit the Bank also suggests that the advice was given in his role as 
an employee. All of this, together with the fact that Henry is known 
to work late and uses the pub for work, suggests that he could have 
been in the course of his employment.
On the basis that the Bank could be deemed vicariously liable for Henry’s  
statement, it is important to advise the Bank now as to whether a 
duty of care was owed to Gideon.4 Generally, there is reluctance to 
find duties for economic losses. Partly this is because, as Lord Reid 
observed in Hedley Byrne v Heller [1964] AC 465, people will often 
express definite opinions in informal settings, even though recognising 
that people may be influenced by them, but they do so without the 
same level of care as if it was a professional setting. As words can 
spread far and be relied upon by people of whom the maker has no 
2 You want to briefly show that 
you know what the test was 
historically, especially as this 
is still a consideration, but you 
should then go on to show 
how you are aware that this is 
no longer deemed completely 
suitable.
3 Remember you have not 
yet established that there is 
negligence at this stage.
4 Even if you conclude that the 
Bank would not be vicariously 
liable, you need to remember 
that the main issue of the 
question is whether a duty 
of care is owed for economic 
loss. Therefore, you would still 
need to go into this but use 
an opening phrase such as 
‘On the basis that the bank 
was . . . ’.

98

knowledge, it can lead to indeterminate liability to an indeterminate 
class. Therefore the House of Lords held a duty could, in principle, 
exist but more was needed than for normal negligent injuries. There 
would need to be an assumption of responsibility by Henry towards 
Gideon, and then reasonable reliance by Gideon on the statement.
A duty can occur outside of contractual and fiduciary relationships 
(Hedley Byrne) as the assumption with the reliance is deemed to 
create a special relationship which overcomes the law’s reservations. 
The Bank should be advised, though, that Lord Reid in Hedley Byrne 
suggested that a special relationship could only arise in a business 
situation owing to the reasons stated above. Therefore, while the 
social nature of the incident may still warrant being classed as in the 
course of Henry’s employment, it may negate the imposition of a duty 
of care. The Court of Appeal has, though, found a duty in a situation 
of non-business advice between friends (Chaudhry v Prabhakar 
[1988] 3 All ER 718). In any event the existence of an assumption 
of responsibility is judged objectively (Henderson v Merrett Syn-
dicates [1995] 2 AC 145), but a divergence of opinion exists as to 
whether it refers to the task or actual legal responsibility.5 In White v 
Jones [1995] 2 AC 207 Lord Browne-Wilkinson felt it referred to the 
task. If this is the case, by making the statement Henry could be said 
to have assumed responsibility. However, this is questioned academ-
ically by Murphy (1996), who argues it must refer to assuming legal 
responsibility to the claimant. On this basis Henry arguably fails this 
requirement. He has indicated that Gideon should visit him tomorrow 
in the Bank to discuss the investment and also indicates that he has 
been drinking. These facts could actually also be used to counter any 
suggestion of even satisfying Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s interpretation, 
as he has not technically given advice.
Gideon obviously relies on the statement, which means that if a duty 
was found, causation would also be satisfied;6 however, reliance must 
be reasonable. The informal context – with Henry leaving a pub, indi-
cating that he has drunk a lot of strong lager,7 while additionally only 
saying they will discuss the investment tomorrow – means it can be 
strongly argued, especially in light of the sums involved,8 that Gideon’s 
reliance was in fact wholly unreasonable.
Therefore, while it would seem that the requirements for a duty 
have not been satisfied, it has been held in Customs and Excise

in this part of your advice 
allows your answer to develop 
into an academic discussion 
of the law and shows your 
awareness of differing 
academic and judicial opinion 
as to what this element of the 
test means.
6 Insert a reference to 
causation to show that you 
are also advising in the wider 
context of negligence as, if 
the Bank is to be liable, which 
is what the question asks you 
to advise them on, this is a 
factor which would need to be 
satisfied.

a lot, you want to keep driving 
home the facts which support 
the view you are expressing. 
As long as the context is 
there, this is fine.

is all about the application of 
the facts, so you do not need 
to write that much here and 
you do not need any great 
reference to case law.

  Question 7
Commissioners v Barclays Bank plc [2007] 1 AC 181 that the 
absence of an assumption of responsibility does not prevent resort to 
finding a duty on the basis of the alternative threefold test. However, 
while foreseeability is present here and proximity is also arguably 
satisfied owing to their past relationship, the reasons why Gideon’s 
reliance is not reasonable are also likely to mean that it is not fair, just 
and reasonable in these circumstances to find a duty towards Gideon.
In conclusion,9 it appears that on either basis of establishing a duty 
for economic loss, Gideon is unlikely to be successful and, therefore, 
the Bank will not be liable for Henry’s advice.
9 Although the preceding 
paragraph may read like a 
conclusion and the end of 
your answer, you should just 
draw both strands of potential 
liability together and conclude 
by reiterating that both tests 
are likely to fail.

■ Advise the Bank on the rationale behind vicarious liability as the doctrine may be used to 
support why they could end up liable.
■ Explain why the law is more reluctant to recognise a duty of care in relation to purely 
economic losses.
■ Relate your discussion of the impact of the statement being apparently made in a social 
context to the issue of whether Henry is in fact in the course of his employment.
■ Include a fuller discussion on whether the other elements of negligence are present to 
round off your advice to the Bank, if the Bank was deemed to owe a duty.

is a potential issue there and that you have an understanding of how the law works, 
but remember that the main thrust of the question is on economic loss. Although at the 
same time, make sure you do cover all aspects of it.
■ Go off on a long tangent with your discussion of what the phrase ‘assumption of 
responsibility’ should mean; remember the question is ultimately about advising the

  Question 8
Cogmire Builders Ltd contracted to renovate a sports complex for Quay Borough Council, 
who had bought the existing premises after the complex had closed down. Under the terms 
of the contract the shell of the building is to be built by Cogmire Builders Ltd, but certain 
specialist electrical work was carried out by Peter & Sons Ltd. All building operations were 
solely supervised by a firm of consulting architects, Cleveland Consultants, who were 
employed by Cogmire Builders Ltd at the request of the Council as they had previously 
overseen other Council projects and were specialists in this type of work.
On the day the new complex was due to open, a fire broke out which was caused by the 
negligent electrical work of Peter & Sons Ltd, and the complex remained closed for a further 
two months.
Several months after the complex finally opened, cracks appeared in the floor of the gym. 
Investigations showed that the floor was not laid properly and could not take the weight of 
the machines. The sports complex was closed for several weeks while the gym floor was 
re-laid and reinforced.
Cogmire Builders Ltd has now gone out of business; advise Quay Borough Council as to 
what action, if any, they may take in common law negligence.

floor as an option for claiming the losses from that defect.
➜ In doing so, explore the ex-post rationalisation of Junior Books as an application of the 
Hedley Byrne principle and assess whether this helps.
Answer
The issue here is whether the Council has any redress for the eco-
nomic losses which they have incurred through the negligent con-
struction of the new complex. This area of negligence is one which is 
tightly restricted on policy grounds, meaning there is little scope for a 
duty of care to be established. However, there are some limited excep-
tions and the Council will be advised of two which may be applicable 
to their case: namely, the ‘complex structure theory’ for the electrics 
and the case of Junior Books in relation to the gym floor.1
The Council should be advised that the general position is that where 
someone negligently performs an act, they will not be liable for any 
losses which result that are of a purely economic nature. However, 
economic losses which are consequential to property damage or 
physical injury can be claimed if a duty was owed and its breach 
caused such damage or injury. While it may seem that the fire 
damage and the floor cracks are property damage, they should be 
advised that the courts see situations such as this as simply a case 
of purchasing something which is of less quality and, thus, value, 
than what was expected. Therefore, the actual loss is the financial 
cost of bringing the premises up to the standard that was expected 
(Murphy v Brentwood DC [1991] 1 AC 398).2 The rationale for this 
position3 was explored in Spartan Steel & Alloys Ltd v Martin & 
Co. (Contractors) Ltd [1973] 1 QB 27 and includes the prospect of 
indeterminate liability for the defendant, the fact that the nature of the 
risk was such that precautions could be taken, e.g. insurance, and 
the need to avoid undermining contract law. Allowing a tortious claim 
for a defective product would create a transferable non-contractual 
warranty. It would also duplicate contract law which provides remedies 
where a product is not of satisfactory quality or fit for purpose.
In relation to the fire damage, if the Council directly contracted with 
Peter & Sons, a claim under the contract would arise. If not, the 
Council may still have an exception to the general position under 
1 As the law is quite firm in its 
reluctance to recognise a duty 
in such a situation as this, it is 
perhaps even more beneficial 
to highlight early on how you 
are going to go about arguing 
your case so the marker 
knows.
2 It is important near the 
start of your advice to the 
Council to explain not only 
what the legal position is, but 
also to demonstrate that you 
understand why their situation 
falls within that position. This 
sentence shows the marker 
that you have fully understood 
the context of the question 
and grasped the basic 
principles.
3 By then going into the 
rationale for this position and 
explaining it to the Council, you 
will reinforce the impression 
that you fully understand the 
framework for this area and 
early on in your answer have 
obtained a good foundation of 
marks before you have really 
got into the question.

102
5  Negligence: Combined issue questions
the ‘complex structure theory’ which would allow a claim against 
the electricians. The theory suggests that the different elements of 
a building can be viewed as distinct items of property and thus if 
one part damages another part, there would be sufficient appropriate 
property damage on which to base a claim for economic loss. In 
the Council’s case this would mean that the electrical work is dis-
tinguished from the rest of the complex which it damaged through 
its negligent installation.4 However, the theory, first mooted in D & F 
Estates v Church Commissioners for England [1989] AC 177 
as a basis for explaining Anns v Merton LBC [1978] AC 728, is not 
an adopted legal principle. The theory received a closer evaluation in 
Murphy, and notwithstanding academic criticism it received some 
judicial support for its application in limited circumstances. Lords 
Keith, Jauncey and Bridge5 stated that the complex part in question 
would need to have been installed by a sub-contractor. Here, the 
Council should be advised that if the electricians were sub-contracted 
by Cogmire Builders, they would appear to have a claim. This is sup-
ported by the fact that all three gave an example of when the theory 
could apply – negligently fitted electrical wiring which caused a fire.
If a duty is held to exist, as we are told the electrical work by Peter 
& Sons was negligently fitted and this caused the fire to break out,6 
it appears that the Council would have a claim against them in neg-
ligence for the economic losses suffered. The only possible defence 
they may have is an exclusion clause;7 however, in view of the danger 
to life, this is likely to be unreasonable under the Unfair Contract 
Terms Act 1977.
In relation to the gym floor, as Cogmire Builders have gone out of 
business, any potential claim, in contract or tort, would be futile.8 
This leaves only the consultants as possible defendants. This is com-
plicated by the absence of a contract between them and the Council: 
they were contracted by the builders. As above, the loss is purely 
economic, but the Council may have recourse to the case of Junior 
Books in any claim.
In that case, a specialist sub-contractor, specifically chosen by the 
claimant to be employed by the main contractor, was successfully 
sued when their work, defective flooring, turned out to have been 
negligently performed. There is a slight factual similarity, therefore, 
between both instances. This is important as Junior Books has been

of the theory, illustrate how 
it transfers to the facts to 
show the marker what you 
are thinking before you go on 
to discuss the merits of the 
theory in full.
5 By including the comments 
of all three you show that, 
while not part of the ratio of 
the case, it did have majority 
support.
6 As the facts indicate that 
this is a given, there is no 
need to go into depth as to 
what is required in these 
aspects of negligence, but 
for completeness you should 
use the facts as stated in 
the question to support the 
proposition that a negligence 
claim can be supported.
7 Although there is nothing to 
suggest this is the case on 
the facts, you should consider 
it, as, just because one is 
not expressly mentioned, it 
could well be the case and 
so your advice would be 
incomplete without assessing 
the implications of one being 
present.

point but important in the 
context of giving advice as to 
what action may be taken.

picked up on the fact and 
understand the implication.

  Question 8
subsequently heavily criticised and seems now confined to its own 
facts (Muirhead v Industrial Tank Specialities [1986] QB 507). 
In the case, Lord Roskill outlined several factors which created a suf-
ficient degree of proximity between the parties. These included being 
nominated and specialists in the role they were contracted for. Further, 
the sub-contractors were solely responsible for the contracted task 
and knew exactly what was required. As such they knew that their skill 
and experience were being relied upon by the claimants. While slightly 
different, the Council should be advised that there is some correlation 
here. The consultants were specialists in overseeing this sort of work 
and hand-picked by the Council for their skill and experience. As 
such, they were solely responsible for overseeing the construction 
and would have appreciated this and that their expertise was being 
relied upon by the Council.
The Council should be warned, though, that while the case has not 
been overruled, it has been criticised at every opportunity by the 
House of Lords and, therefore, basing a claim on this authority may 
not be the best course. As the case has been subsequently ration-
alised on the basis of the Hedley Byrne principle of assumption of 
responsibility, any claim should perhaps be framed on this basis. 
This requires the Council demonstrating that Cleveland Consultants, in 
performing their service, assumed responsibility towards the Council 
who reasonably relied upon their service. This appears supported on 
the factors mentioned above in relation to Junior Books; however, in 
Henderson v Merrett Syndicates [1995] 2 AC 145 this explanation 
of Junior Books was doubted. Therefore, any claim for the losses 
from the cracked floor may prove futile, no matter how it is framed, 
for the absence of a duty.
In conclusion, owing to the nature of the losses suffered by the Council,  
their chances of any actions being successful are remote. However, 
it may be possible to successfully sue the electricians in relation to 
the cost of restoring the complex following the fire, but the losses from 
repairing the gym floor will be harder to recoup.

How this topic may come up in exams
This topic is centred primarily on the Consumer Protection Act 1987; however, the 
Act did not abolish the common law negligence action. Therefore, you also need 
to be aware of the narrow rule in Donoghue v Stevenson and how this applies to 
manufacturers of defective products. The existence of both actions means that a 
comparative essay is likely, alongside issues of why the Act was needed. However, 
the differences between the two actions mean that both will have to be discussed 
in problem questions in order to assess which claim may be best.

Act 1987. If this is so and the shortcomings at common law can be 
overplayed, then the Act can be said to be unnecessary. It is argued 
though that, while the Act was passed as part of a wider EU-driven 
process of consumer protection within the Internal Market,1 it over-
comes shortcomings that would otherwise limit consumer protection.
The narrower importance of Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562 
is that it created the traditional action for product liability by imposing 
a duty of care on manufacturers to the ultimate consumer of their 
products if the product is intended to reach the consumer in the con-
dition it left the manufacturer, with no reasonable chance of inspection 
by an intermediary. Therefore, if this duty was breached by failing to 
take reasonable care and this breach caused damage, which was of 
a foreseeable nature, then the manufacturer was liable unless they 
had a valid defence.2
This means, as the quote highlights, showing fault by the manufacturer 
is the principal shortcoming. While this is a hurdle, particularly as 
evidence of compliance with set standards may go against negligence, 
as Clerk & Lindsell states, it is not insurmountable. The more crucial 
obstacle is the need to prove causation which is also a feature of 
a strict liability regime. However, the traditional action has further 
shortcomings that are not as easily overplayed.3 First, there must 
not have been a reasonable possibility for the product to have been 
inspected between manufacture and purchase by the consumer. If 
someone in the supply or manufacturing chain could have inspected 
the product and found the defect, then the manufacturer avoids 
liability. As consumers may not if this is the situation, something of 
a lottery is created. Significantly, where the goods are imported, and 
the importer has not had the chance to inspect them, any claim will 
be against an overseas-based manufacturer.
Secondly, Donoghue concerned product manufacture and not design 
defects. Often the design creates the defect rather than the absence 
of reasonable care when making the product. Further, where a design 
defect exists there is a greater potential for harm as all of the products 
1 Not only is this factually 
and legally accurate, but 
by mentioning it here, 
you demonstrate that you 
are aware of the Act’s 
background and place in the 
wider scheme of the law. 
You will also have shown 
straight away that you have 
recognised how this relates 
to the premise within the 
question: namely, that 
regardless of the merits of the 
protection under the Act, it 
was required.
2 The question is 
predominantly on the need 
for the Act in light of similar 
protection being offered by 
the common law, especially 
as that claim is not as difficult 
to satisfy as is argued. You 
need to set out the basis of 
the negligence claim, but 
focus on the shortcomings 
of the actions, i.e. the 
challenges to a successful 
claim. This sets a platform 
from which you can discuss 
whether the Act was actually 
needed in practice.
3 Address the shortcoming of 
needing to show fault first, 
but do highlight the range of 
limitations of the traditional 
action to show your full 
knowledge of the action and 
enable you to tackle head-on 
why the Act was passed and 
refute the implication in the 
question that the Act was 
not needed to be passed, 
the traditional action may not 
be as problematic as can be 
made out.

111
  Question 1
are affected, not just a batch. The importance of causation in negli-
gence deepens this problem, as a claimant must show that the design 
defect is capable of causing the harm in question, and then did cause 
that harm. This difficulty is clearly evidenced in relation to medicinal 
drugs and the Thalidomide cases. In negligence, claimants do not 
benefit from hindsight (Roe v Minister of Health [1954] 2 QB 66) 
and must show that at the time of the product’s circulation the man-
ufacturer acted unreasonably.
Consequently, the idea of a strict liability regime emerged which is 
consistent with the principles of loss distribution, deterrence and 
economic efficiency.4 The manufacturer is best placed to insure the 
risk and can then pass this cost on to consumers. To ensure lower 
prices, greater care would be taken to ensure premiums do not rise.5 
The idea also reflects the viewpoint that it is fair to impose the risk 
on the manufacturer as they created the product for profit. The EU 
took the initiative, however, with Product Liability Directive 85/374/
EEC aiming to harmonise the level of protection across all member 
states by implementing a strict liability regime. Therefore, even 
without the shortcomings of the traditional approach in Donoghue 
there was a need to enact the statute, although this could be reviewed 
post-Brexit if the statutory regime is deemed less adequate.6
Notwithstanding its shortcomings, Parliament retained the traditional 
action.7 The Act’s central aim is to impose liability without fault on the 
producer of a defective product (s. 2(1)). Section 1(2) defines ‘product’ 
broadly, namely as any ‘goods or electricity’, including a component of 
a larger product, such as the fan within a laptop. Under the Act, the 
product’s producer also includes the person who imported the prod-
uct into the EU which overcomes a significant shortcoming of the 
traditional action by making it easier for consumers than having to sue 
a manufacturer from overseas, although this advantage may be lost in 
a post-Brexit Britain.8 Generally, however, suppliers avoid liability for 
the defect unless the conditions of section 2(3) are satisfied.
4 Demonstrate your awareness 
of principles of tort, and your 
understanding of this tort, by 
showing how the justification 
for the new basis of liability 
is rooted in the fundamental 
principles of tort.
5 Use this opportunity to show 
off your deeper knowledge 
of tort and its underlying 
principles in order to support 
why the idea of a strict liability 
regime had merit. By relating 
its implementation to tort 
principles, you strengthen the 
argument that it is justifiable.
6 The point here is to show 
that you are aware of the 
imperative to pass the statute 
due to the influence of EU 
law whilst also tying in your 
knowledge of current affairs 
and how the current political 
situation could influence this 
area of tort. It will also allow 
you to set up your answer, if 
you prefer the Act’s protection, 
to argue that it should be 
retained even if the EU 
compliance justification is lost.
7 Although you are now talking 
about the Act, make sure you 
show that you know how the 
two actions relate to each 
other, seeing as both still exist

you are considering not only 
whether the position under 
the Act is an improvement, 
but will stay an improvement 
in light of forthcoming political 
changes.

6  Product liability
Provided the Act does impose strict liability regime it can be justified.9 
However, the Act’s wording and early cases suggested liability was 
not so strict. Section 3 defines ‘defect’ as being where ‘the safety of 
the product is not such as persons are generally entitled to expect’. 
Under section 3(2) all circumstances should be taken into account 
when determining the level of safety that the public can expect. 
These include the product’s marketing and whether any instructions 
or warnings regarding its use were provided. Further consideration 
is to be given to how the product may reasonably be expected to 
be used and the time when the product was supplied. The issue 
is that, while the Act seeks strict liability, determining whether the 
product was defective allows for the consideration of fault, and so 
negligence reappears by the back door. This was seen in Worsley 
v Tambrands Ltd [2000] PIQR 95 where a warning placed on the 
product regarding a small risk of toxic shock syndrome meant that lia-
bility was avoided.10 The courts’ assessment of a warning’s sufficiency 
can be said to amount to whether the manufacturer has been at fault. 
This negates the Act’s purpose and supports the suggestion that it 
was not needed as it does not solve the difficulties of negligence, as 
establishing a lack of care would still be required, and then that this 
caused the resultant injury. The use of fault-based reasoning was 
criticised in Abouzaid v Mothercare (UK) Ltd [2000] All ER D 2436, 
with whether the defect had come to Mothercare’s attention deemed 
irrelevant. The lack of negligence was held to not prevent liability 
under the Act. The emphasis on strict liability was followed in A v 
National Blood Authority [2001] 3 All ER 289, where consideration 
of the care taken by the manufacturer was excluded; what should be 
assessed are all relevant circumstances, not all circumstances. While 
perhaps contrary to the wording of both the Act and Directive, A is 
defendable for giving effect to the spirit of the legislation and provides 
a justifiable rationale for the Act.11
In conclusion, the Act, especially as interpreted in A, provides increased 
consumer protection to that which exists under Donoghue. Even if the 
obvious shortcoming can be overplayed, and the action under the Act 
shares the difficulty of proving causation, the broader shortcomings 
of Donoghue necessitate the statutory regime. Notwithstanding any 
difficulties arising from the Act, a strict liability regime is a welcome 
addition to the law on product liability and should be retained even 
when not needed to comply with EU directives.

your answer like this, it 
means that you are relating 
your discussion back to the 
statement and shows that 
you are now dealing with the 
underlying premise within the

10 There are a number of 
cases that you could use 
here. It does not matter which 
you do use, so long as you 
include one which illustrates 
the point that the courts were 
interpreting ‘defect’ in a way 
which was akin to looking for 
fault. This forms the basis of 
whether, despite the Directive, 
the Act was worthwhile or just 
reiterating the common law 
position.

  Question 1
Make your answer stand out
■ Discuss briefly the limited scope of liability in this area prior to Donoghue v Stevenson 
[1932] AC 562.
■ Read Stapleton, J. (1994b) Product Liability. London: Butterworths. This will allow you 
to incorporate material regarding the theoretical basis for strict liability in this area and 
why this approach was adopted in the EU in light of American experiences. You can then 
question the merits of strict liability.
■ Refer to journal articles on A v National Blood Authority [2001] 3 All ER 289 as, if this 
case is wrong to adopt such a strict line in relation to ‘defect’, then we arguably do have 
a system which considers fault. You can then consider whether there is still enough 
distinction between the claims to warrant the existence of both actions. For example, 
look at Hodges, C. (2001) Compensating patients: case comment on A v National Blood 
Authority [2001] 3 All ER 289. Law Quarterly Review, 117: 528; and Howells, G. and 
Mildred, M. (2002) Infected blood: defect and discoverability a first exposition of the EC 
Product Liability Directive. Modern Law Review, 65: 95.
■ Evaluate in more detail whether any improvements could be lost post-Brexit and how.
Don’t be tempted to . . . 
■ Try to cover all of the provisions of the Act. Remember that the main aspect of the 
question focuses on whether the Act improves the situation by overcoming the difficulties 
of the common law.
■ Describe in detail the full requirements of negligence. Explain what they are, but focus on 
the problems they caused.
■ Gloss over the influence of European law in this area. Ultimately that was the reason for 
passing the Act and, so, on a question regarding whether the Act was necessary, it is 
quite a fundamental point. Similarly, do not gloss over Brexit as if the EU was the driver 
for the Act that need may soon disappear.

6  Product liability
  Question 2
Nicholas Guy is a brand of luxury hair straighteners which have just released a new product, 
the fh24/7. A prominent feature was a new safety device whereby the straighteners con-
tained a motion sensor within the heat-plates. The sensor was designed to cut off power to 
the heat-plates, which could reach 200 degrees Celsius, after five minutes of inactivity. The 
product is manufactured in the USA, but imported into the UK and sold exclusively by luxury 
retail chain, Lewis Fraser’s, at a cost of £300.
Sunita, who had had several near misses of overheating having left straighteners on, and 
had been shocked to have read news stories of the damage which could be caused, decided 
to buy the fh24/7 as soon as it was released. However, having seen the cost she had second 
thoughts until a shop assistant persuaded her that other features, such as the comfy grip, 
light weight and overall energy efficiency, were worth it.
However, the fh24/7 had a design fault whereby the motion sensor would not cut off the 
power supply until after 50 minutes of inactivity. A last-minute test by Nicholas Guy identi-
fied the fault, but as the marketing materials had already been produced and orders placed, 
the company did not want to pull the product. Instead they quickly inserted a warning that 
the product should be used in conjunction with a heat-resistant mat and that care should 
be taken to turn off the straighteners after use. It was felt that if this was done, no damage 
should be caused and any complaints could be dealt with on an individual basis.
One morning though, having overslept, Sunita was late for work and forgot to turn off the 
hair straighteners after using them and left them on the laminated wood floor. The sensor 
failed to cut off the power despite not picking up movement for over five minutes. Conse-
quently they overheated and caught fire, which then spread throughout Sunita’s house. The 
fire caused such severe damage that the house was totally destroyed.
Advise Sunita as to what action she may take, and against whom, for the losses that she has 
suffered.

  Question 2

Answer
Sunita requires advice on her ability to recover for the loss of her 
property resulting from the fire, and who she can recover these 
losses from. This will involve advising Sunita on the provisions of 
the Consumer Protection Act 1987 as well as the common law tort 
of negligence. It will be argued that, while compensation cannot be 
obtained for the damaged straighteners, any other damaged property 
will be recoverable under one or both actions.
Sunita should be advised that Parliament passed the Consumer 
Protection Act 1987 so as to give effect to the Consumer Protection 
Directive. The aim was to better protect consumers from defective 
products by resolving some of the problems which had existed 
previously in common law claims for negligence.1 Strict liability is 
imposed on producers of products which cause damage owing wholly 
or partly to defects within the product (s. 2(1)). The hair straighteners 
will clearly be a product under section 1(2).
The first issue is whether Sunita has suffered actionable damage 
under the Act in order to bring a claim.2 Under section 5(2) the loss 
of the actual straighteners is not recoverable as this is purely, an eco-
nomic loss to the product itself. However, under section 5(1), damage 
is recoverable for any other property, including land. This is important 
1 You could legitimately 
deal with the common law 
negligence claim first. If this 
is the approach that you 
adopt, use a line such as this 
one to explain why the Act 
has come into being to offer a 
parallel form of protection.
2 Deal with this before the 
position of the two possible 
defendants as if the property 
is not recoverable under the 
Act, there is no point bringing 
a claim against either.
• Identify the damage suﬀered
• Establish an actionable defect
• Determine who is best to sue
• Explain why there is suﬃcient damage
   for the purposes of section 5
• Consider what defences may apply
Under the Act
• Explain the existence of a duty under
   Donoghue
• Identify how it was breached
• Apply the relevant principles of causation
   and remoteness
• Consider any applicable defences
At common law

116
6  Product liability
as Sunita’s house suffered severe damage, so this can be claimed 
for alongside her personal possessions. The Act restricts the amount 
of property that Sunita can claim though to that worth over £275 
(s. 5(4)). Therefore, it is likely some of her damaged personal goods 
will not be recoverable.
The question is who is liable for the damage. Nicholas Guy have 
manufactured the straighteners and so are naturally the producer for 
the purposes of section 1(2); however, as they are based overseas 
it may be easier for Sunita to sue Lewis Fraser’s as the supplier of 
the straighteners.3 This is possible as they have imported the prod-
uct into the EU and section 2(2)(c) provides that liability will apply to 
such a person. However, as the straighteners identify who the actual 
producer of the product is, a requirement for imposing liability on a 
supplier such as Lewis Fraser’s is missing. Therefore, any action will 
just be against Nicholas Guy.
Under section 3(1), a defect in the straighteners must then be estab-
lished. The section makes clear that there will be a defect where 
the product ‘is not such as persons are generally entitled to expect’. 
Importantly for Sunita, this includes components within the product 
and safety in the context of risks of damage to property. Guidance is 
given in section 3(2) as to what the public are entitled to expect, but it 
is clear from cases such as A v National Blood Authority [2001] 3 
All ER 289 that a strict line is taken against the producers and efforts 
are made to remove considerations of fault. This is in keeping with 
the purpose of imposing strict liability under the Act.4 Therefore, even 
though there was a warning of sorts in terms of using the product, 
the nature of the defect here, overheating and fire risk,5 coupled with 
the fact the company knew the sensor did not cut off the power after 
five minutes, means that the straighteners are certain to be found 
defective.
It is clear that none of the defences contained in section 4 are appli-
cable, especially in light of their knowledge. However, under section 
6(4) contributory negligence can apply to claims under the Act. The 
product specifies that it should be placed on a heat-resistant mat, 
and should always be unplugged after use. Sunita did neither of 
these things, yet knew hair straighteners could cause fires. While not 
capable under the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 of 
completely absolving Nicholas Guy, the defence is likely to succeed 
3 You are showing off a touch 
here, by demonstrating your 
wider knowledge. However, 
to do this legitimately you 
need to include a line such 
as this to explain why you are 
exploring the possibility even 
though it will, ultimately, not 
apply. Do keep this section 
brief though, in light of that 
fact, otherwise you risk 
looking as if you understand it 
less than you do.
4 Explain why the courts 
take such an approach and 
comment on the justification 
for it, particularly as some 
authorities have tried to 
incorporate fault.
5 In light of what you are 
writing at this point, reiterate 
what you see as the defect 
in the straighteners to 
substantiate the point.

117
  Question 2
in reducing part of the damages awarded to Sunita.6 The reduction 
may not be large though, as while using a mat may have stopped the 
fire from starting before the sensor finally worked, Sunita could legit-
imately counter that the fire may not have started at all if the product 
had worked as advertised.
Although Parliament sought to better protect consumers, the Act 
operates complementary to common law negligence which can still 
be used. There is no value threshold in such actions and so it provides 
a useful vehicle to recover for any property damaged by the fire, which 
is worth less than £275.7 The loss of the straighteners themselves, 
though, will still simply be regarded as purely economic and is not 
recoverable (Murphy v Brentwood DC [1991] 1 AC 398).8
Sunita must show that she was owed a duty of care in relation to the 
product. This is easily shown as the actual ratio of Donoghue 9 is 
that the manufacturer owes a duty of care to the ultimate consumer 
of their product. Therefore, Nicholas Guy owed Sunita a duty of care 
to take reasonable care in the manufacturing of their straighteners to 
ensure that their use would be safe.
The issue is, obviously, whether Nicholas Guy did take such reasona-
ble care. Even if the faulty motion sensor was sourced from someone 
else, Nicholas Guy must exercise reasonable care purchasing that part 
and checking it is suitable (Winward v TVR Engineering [1986] 
BTLC 366). While Sunita should be advised that the principle of res 
ipsa loquitur does not apply (Donoghue), the courts have been will-
ing to infer a lack of reasonable care from the presence of a defect 
(Grant v Australian Knitting Mills Ltd [1936] AC 85). The fact that 
Nicholas Guy knew of the fault and circulated the product would be a 
strong indication of a lack of care.
Causation10 is also clearly established here, as ‘but for’ the fault the 
straighteners would not have overheated and the fire would not have 
started. This is especially the case considering that the straighteners 
would not have gone through any other inspection process between 
manufacture and purchase by Sunita which could be said to have 
interfered with the product. It would also seem obvious that fire dam-
age was damage of a foreseeable type which would occur from the 
fault. The partial defence of contributory negligence would, equally, 
apply to this claim.
6 Make sure that you get 
across your knowledge that 
it is only a partial defence 
as this shows you fully 
understand the nature of the 
defence.
7 Include this to show that you 
are aware of the distinction 
between the two actions and 
to demonstrate why you are 
discussing this when it seems 
Sunita may succeed under 
the Act.
8 By mentioning this at the 
start, it ties in with your 
previous sentence about why 
it may be worth bringing a 
claim in negligence while also 
showing that you know the 
limitations of such an action.
9 By wording this in this 
way, you show that you are 
fully aware of the differing 
principles which come out of 
Donoghue, and particularly 
that you understand its direct 
application to this issue.
10 On the facts, there is no 
real issue of the aspects of 
causation and remoteness, 
and there is no real defence 
available. Therefore, 
sum these up in the one 
paragraph, although, if you 
are faced with a question 
which does need more 
detailed discussion of any 
of these points, then use a 
separate paragraph.

118
6  Product liability
Therefore, in conclusion, Sunita is likely to have a claim under the 
Act for the damage to her home caused by the fire and any other 
property of hers, worth over £275, which was damaged in the 
fire. Alternatively, she could claim in negligence and this may be 
advisable as an additional claim for obtaining property which is under 
the threshold value of the Act. However, whichever way the action is 
brought the loss of the straighteners will not be recoverable owing to 
this being purely economic loss.

  Question 3
  Question 3
Piper and Galbraith plc is a pharmaceutical company and has recently produced a new drug, 
Fiagera, which is marketed as preventing anxiety attacks. The drug was subjected to trials in 
the UK in line with industry standards and approved by the national regulator.
Approval, though, was subject to the drug’s packaging highlighting that it should not be used 
by people suffering epilepsy. However, research in Canada indicated that an ingredient of the 
drug could cause kidney damage if it was taken for a sustained period. This was published 
in the Journal of Canadian Medicine, which is also available globally.
Manisha had regularly suffered anxiety attacks during her first two years at university. As a 
result, she visited Dr Legg who, having never seen Manisha before, prescribed her Fiagera 
without knowing that she suffered from epilepsy. After taking the drug for four weeks, 
Manisha went into epileptic shock. However, while she was in hospital it was also discovered 
that Manisha had suffered damage to her kidneys.
Advise Manisha on whether she could succeed in a claim against Piper and Galbraith for her

Answer
The issue to advise Manisha about is whether she can successfully 
sue Piper and Galbraith (P&G) for the epileptic attack and the kidney 
damage following her taking of Fiagera. There are two options 
available to her: one in negligence and another under the Consumer 
Protection Act 1987. It is argued that Manisha may succeed under 
the Act for the kidney damage.
Manisha could firstly claim in negligence.1 Following the specific rule in 
Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562, a manufacturer owes a duty 
to take reasonable care when manufacturing a product, to ensure it is 
safe when used by the ultimate consumer. However, it would be very 
difficult for Manisha to succeed in this claim. Under Donoghue the 
duty is only owed when the product is intended to reach the consumer 
in the same state as it left the manufacturer, without any reasonable 
chance of intermediary inspection. Manisha was prescribed the drug by 
Dr Legg and so arguably there was a reasonable chance of inspection 
by him. Dr Legg should have enquired as to whether Manisha suffered 
epilepsy and thus not prescribed it to her in light of the warning. An 
analogy could be drawn here with Evans v Triplex Safety Glass  
Co. Ltd [1963] 1 All ER 283 where the windscreen was fitted by 
another party. Manisha should be advised that Dr Legg’s failure to do 
this may mean that she would have a claim in negligence against him 
under Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee [1957] 
1 WLR 582.2 Even in relation to the kidney damage, Manisha is likely 
1 Owing to the facts of the 
question and the difficulties 
of bringing such a claim, deal 
with common law negligence 
first. This will allow you to end 
your answer more strongly by 
discussing the claim which 
is more likely to succeed. 
Your answer will read a bit 
strangely if you write about 
the Act first and the argument 
that Manisha may succeed 
and then proceed to talk 
about an alternative claim 
which is likely to fail.
2 While you have not been 
asked to advise Manisha 
regarding Dr Legg, by 
highlighting this you 
demonstrate your wider 
knowledge and understanding 
of negligence, so it is 
beneficial but do keep it brief.

121
  Question 3
to have problems in negligence owing to the need to prove that, even 
if P&G failed to take reasonable care in producing the drug, this breach 
of duty caused her injuries. There could be various reasons for the 
kidney damage, such as Manisha’s lifestyle or whether she was taking 
any other medicines. This task is made harder by the fact that this is a 
design defect rather than a manufacturing defect and the courts have 
been more ready to infer negligence in the latter (Grant v Australian 
Knitting Mills Ltd [1936] AC 85). Therefore, Manisha is unlikely to 
succeed in negligence against P&G.
However, in view of the difficulties with a fault-based system of liability 
for defective products, a strict liability regime has been implemented 
in addition.3 The Act implemented Directive 85/374/EEC, which 
sought to introduce strict liability for defective products as a means 
of ensuring a level of harmonisation for consumers within the Internal 
Market.4 It is clear from section 1(2) and section 45 that the drug will 
be a product for the purposes of the Act. The fact that Fiagera is made 
up of different ingredients will not matter as section 1(2) states that a 
product also includes the component parts within an overall product. 
It is also clear that P&G will be the producer for the purposes of the 
Act as they have manufactured the drug (s. 1(2)).
The damage must be actionable under the Act which this is, as under 
section 5(1) damage means personal injury, which Manisha has 
clearly suffered. The question is whether the product was defective. 
Section 3 defines ‘defect’ as where the ‘safety of the product is not 
such as persons generally are entitled to expect’. Guidance is given in 
section 3(2) which significantly states5 that account should be taken 
of how the product is marketed and the instructions given. We are 
told that Fiagera was approved and marketed as not being suitable for 
epileptics. This causes a problem for Manisha as the first injury she 
suffers is that of an epileptic attack. Therefore, notwithstanding the 
strict approach taken when interpreting ‘defect’ in A v National Blood 
Authority [2001] 3 All ER 289, Fiagera was a standard product –  
meaning it was designed and manufactured as intended. Further, in 
view of the marketing and that in section 3(2)(b) provision is made as 
to what may reasonably be expected in terms of the product’s use, 
Fiagera is unlikely to be defective. This is a prescription drug and so 
it is reasonable for P&G to expect that the drug would not be used by 
epileptics, especially as this was warned against. Therefore, Manisha 
is unlikely to succeed for the attack.

6  Product liability
However, Manisha has also suffered kidney damage and the like-
lihood of this was not shown on the product.6 Therefore, Manisha 
needs to be advised as to whether Fiagera was defective in relation 
to this injury. The issue in relation to this is that under section 3(2)
(c) the courts should take account of the time at which the product 
was put into circulation. At this time, the trials had not shown that it 
could cause kidney damage. There was evidence from Canada that 
this would be the case. Further, this information was available glob-
ally and so, as a pharmaceutical company, it is arguable that P&G 
should have known of this. This is supported by the strict approach 
endorsed in A. The public would expect Fiagera to be safe, especially 
seeing it had undergone a trial. Therefore, the drug could be said to 
be defective. Manisha’s problem, though, is that even if defective it 
must, on normal causation principles, be shown to have caused the 
kidney damage. Therefore, it must be shown that ‘but for’ the taking 
of Fiagera Manisha would not have suffered kidney damage.7 It is 
difficult to say whether this was the case and a lot will rest on the 
conclusiveness of the Canadian research.
If the drug is deemed defective and causation shown, Manisha should 
be advised that the Act does contain defences. The most significant is 
within section 4(1)(e). This concerns development risks. The producer’s 
knowledge must not be such that a producer of the same product 
might be expected to have discovered the defect while the product 
was under his control.8 Therefore, there is some overlap with whether 
the drug was defective. The question is whether a reasonable producer 
of the same product would have known that the defect existed at the 
time. While criticised as diluting the strictness of liability under the Act, 
it was approved in Commission v UK [1997] 3 CMLR 923.
However, even if generously interpreted, it is unlikely P&G would sat-
isfy this as, arguably, a reasonable producer would keep up to date 
with the latest scientific research.9 Further, the journal was published 
before Fiagera was marketed and as it is a global publication it was 
accessible, which is what is necessary (Commission v UK ).
Therefore, Manisha will be successful in claiming for the kidney dam-
age under the Act provided she can satisfy the issue of causation, 
which may not be easy, as shown in X v Schering Health Care Ltd 
[2002] EWHC 1420. The drug is unlikely to be deemed defective in 
relation to the epilepsy.
6 As the drug is more likely to 
be defective in relation to the 
kidney damage, you should 
deal with this separately from 
the epilepsy. This will aid your 
structure by making it clear 
that you have identified two 
separate issues.
7 If you covered causation in 
more depth previously when 
dealing with the action at 
common law, then you can 
just refer back to it here. 
Make sure you do not repeat 
yourself.
8 You could learn the section 
in full and quote that, but as it 
is quite long it may be better 
to paraphrase it. This will also 
show that you understand 
what the section means, as 
you can write it in your own 
words.
9 Although following A the 
matter is not likely to be 
interpreted generously; by 
highlighting that the claim is 
likely to succeed even on a 
generous view, it strengthens 
the argument that the defence 
will fail.

  Question 3
Make your answer stand out
■ Explore the debate further around section 4(1)(e) and the corresponding part of the 
Directive and the extent to which the section is compatible.
■ Explain in more depth the distinction made in A v National Blood Authority [2001] 3 All 
ER 289 between standard and non-standard products.
■ Consider the merits of strict liability over fault-based negligence and particularly the 
approach taken in A v National Blood Authority [2001] 3 All ER 289 for interpreting the 
Act. In furtherance of this, look at Hodges, C. (2001) Compensating patients: case com-
ment on A v National Blood Authority [2001] 2 All ER 289. Law Quarterly Review, 117: 
528; and Howells, G. and Mildred, M. (2002) Infected blood: defect and discoverability, 
a first exposition of the EC Product Liability Directive, Modern Law Review, 65: 95.
■ Discuss the prospect of P&G being jointly liable with the national regulator that approved 
the drug.
Don’t be tempted to . . . 
■ Ignore either of the possible claims in favour of solely talking about the other in depth. As 
the question does not set any limits, you need to discuss both. Even if you do not do so 
because you feel that claim is futile, it may look like you did not realise there is a chance 
of the claim. At the very least raise it to dismiss the possibility of success.
■ Get into a discussion of loss of a chance and Gregg v Scott [2005] 2 AC 176 with 
regards to any chance of the kidney damage occurring.
■ Merge your discussion as to both injuries, as arguably the outcome will be different and 
so you may find you compromise the clarity of your argument.
■ Set out all of the defences within section 4 unless you can make the case for them being 
relevant; otherwise you will use up valuable time without gaining any real benefit.

Vicarious liability
How this topic may come up in exams
Vicarious liability is an important topic as there could be an element of it in a problem 
question on any other topic, with varying degrees of emphasis. However, it can also 
be examined on its own. Where this is the case, it is more likely to be an essay with 
questions focusing on the justification for imposing liability on a third party who 
did not commit the tort. Therefore, as well as knowing the mechanics of how the 
doctrine works, you will need an in-depth knowledge of the policy and theoretical 
reasons for and against it.

issues raises questions as to whether those policy justifications are 
still met. If not, the validity of the law can justifiably be called into 
question.2 However, it is argued that the current application is a logical 
extension of the traditional position, which is flexible, and still corre-
lates to the doctrine’s original justifications.
Vicarious liability is a doctrine3 which has historically shifted liability 
from an individual tortfeasor to their employer, even in the absence 
of direct fault or breach of duty by the latter. Accordingly, the bur-
den of strict liability is placed on businesses with the potential 
for negative economic consequences, and arguably contrary to 
principles of corrective justice due to the lack of obvious fault on 
their part.4 
However, the doctrine has several justifications. While seemingly 
at odds with corrective justice it actually supports it by ensuring 
that an injured claimant obtains compensation as the business, 
through insurance policies, will be better placed to pay than the 
individual employee tortfeasor.5 As such, its operation also gives 
effect to the principles of loss distribution, economic efficiency 
and deterrence. The more that compensation is paid out, the 
higher the costs of operating that business activity are, even if 
only through increased insurance premiums. Higher costs will 
be passed to their customers which increases the price of their 
2 Your aim here is to introduce 
briefly why the issue that you 
are asked to address arises 
and needs addressing. You 
want to indicate that you 
are aware of the underlying 
issues and what has caused 
them; you can then build on 
these in the main body of 
your answer. This helps to 
reinforce that you understand 
the area of law as well as the 
question.
3 It is worth showing that you 
appreciate the true nature of 
this topic and it is particularly 
important to demonstrate that 
you know it is not a tort itself.
4 Corrective justice is a 
fundamental principle of 
tort, so it is always good to 
incorporate reference to it in 
an answer to highlight your 
appreciation of it. Here, as 
the question explores the 
justification for the doctrine 
of vicarious liability, the 
aim is to start to contrast 
its compatibility with this 
fundamental principle.
5 Start with this point as it 
relates back to the criticism 
raised in the previous 
paragraph and so helps your 
answer flow. You can then 
also link it to other tortious 
principles to show how the 
doctrine is compatible with 
the wider underlying theory of 
tortious liability. Additionally, 
by evaluating the theoretical 
justification for the doctrine 
first, you can establish 
whether any issues are at 
this level or simply ones of 
application by the courts.

129
  Question 1
goods/services, reducing their market competitiveness.6 There-
fore, competiveness and profitability rely on the activity not caus-
ing injuries. The social justification for this is that employers have 
put in motion an activity for their benefit and so should carry the 
risk of liability if that activity causes damage (Rose v Plenty 
[1976] 1 WLR 141).
While justified theoretically, the law’s rationale means liability is 
not automatically imposed, and two requirements need satisfy-
ing.7 First, the tortfeasor is an employee, and secondly, they are 
acting in the course of their employment. Originally, the employ-
ment status of the tortfeasor was based on the level of control 
exerted over them, but as employment practices changed along-
side technological developments, an economic reality test was 
applied which requires an assessment of factors which could 
illustrate an employment relationship alongside control (Mar-
ket Investigations Ltd v Minister of Social Security [1969]  
2 QB 173).
However, the first requirement has moved on following a series of 
cases whereby the relationship between the organisation in question 
and the individual tortfeasor could not realistically be described as 
one of employment, regardless of how that is assessed. This raises 
questions as to the doctrine’s validity as the initial justifications for it 
would seem inapplicable.8 Now, the doctrine can apply to any rela-
tionship provided that the tort was committed as a result of activity 
taken by the tortfeasor on behalf of the defendant enterprise and 
which is likely to be part of its business; and the defendant enterprise 
created the risk of the tort by engaging the tortfeasor to undertake 
that activity.
The inherent vagueness of the position was acknowledged in Cox 
v Ministry of Justice [2016] UKSC 10, but this was accepted as 
being necessary to reflect the wide range of situations to which 
it will need to be applied. Overall, these requirements maintain 
the law’s compatibility with its original justifications9 of economic 
efficiency and deterrence, and the above statement of principle in 
Rose v Plenty.
The doctrine’s second requirement was also developed10 in Lis-
ter v Hesley Hall [2002] 1 AC 215. Now, a ‘close-connection’ 
test assesses whether the tort was so closely connected with the 
6 Discuss the practical impact 
of the doctrine, as it is against 
this which its justification 
must ultimately be judged. If 
it causes firms to go out of 
business, the doctrine could be 
argued as being objectionable 
on policy grounds.
7 Staring your discussion of 
the requirements in this way 
allows you to relate them to 
the justifications which you 
have just considered. This will 
help enable you to determine 
where any problems lie 
and perhaps more strongly 
support the doctrine by 
showing that its application 
correlates to its rationale.
8 You need to set up a 
discussion as to the merits 
of this development, but in a 
way which identifies what the 
issue is in light of what you 
have mentioned previously.
9 Whatever you feel the 
justifications are, you ought to 
introduce them with wording 
such as this to tie these 
concluding remarks back 
to your introduction and the 
issue that you have raised at 
the start of this paragraph.
10 This requirement has 
not really ‘moved’ in some 
time, but in discussing 
what vicarious liability is, 
you need to highlight what 
the requirement entails for 
completeness. This allows 
you though to then evaluate 
whether it does need be 
moved on as well despite what 
the courts have recently said 
in response to criticism of it.

7  Vicarious liability
14 It could be easy to overlook 
Lord Dyson and just focus on 
Lord Toulson who gave the 
leading opinion with which 
everyone else agreed. However, 
Lord Dyson, in his short 
individual opinion, covers this 
point in more detail. Using him 
also shows you have a fuller 
level of knowledge of the case.
function the tortfeasor was entrusted to conduct so as to make it 
fair and just to shift liability to the enterprise in question. This has 
resulted in questionable applications of the doctrine, particularly in 
cases where the conduct was illegal and prohibited. In Lister the 
employee warden had sexually abused children in his employer’s care.  
Liability was imposed because as Lord Steyn11 highlighted, the tort 
was ‘inextricably interwoven’ with his duties. The warden had the 
function of discharging his employer’s duty of care owed to the chil-
dren, which he clearly failed to do.
That the test is also inherently imprecise has been acknowledged 
repeatedly in the Supreme Court with Lord Nicholls in Dubai Alu-
minium Co. Ltd v Salaam & Others [2003] 1 AC 366 accept-
ing it offers no clear guidance on the degree of connection that is 
necessary, which Lord Phillips agreed with in Various Claimants 
v Catholic Child Welfare Society [2012] UKSC 56.12 Operational 
vagueness raises questions as to the doctrine’s rationale, with Long-
more LJ in Maga v Birmingham Roman Catholic Archdiocese 
Trustees [2010] EWCA Civ 256 querying whether the aim is simply to 
ensure someone can pay and encourage more vigilance from employ-
ers. Enterprises may have difficulty in securing sufficient insurance 
though to pay compensation when they do not know what acts may 
need covering. Even if obtained, the premiums may be too prohibitive, 
thus reducing their competitiveness and their financial health: all for 
an act which was not of their doing and even expressly prohibited. 
This is hard to defend and negates this aspect of the law’s rationale.13 
Accordingly, the Supreme Court was invited to abolish the test in 
Mohamud v WM Morrison Supermarkets plc [2016] UKSC 11.
The invitation was rejected as the test only imposes liability where 
it is just to do so. While giving the doctrine further ambiguity, as 
Lord Dyson noted,14 it allows further flexibility and application to new 
situations, with the imprecision being common to many aspects of 
tort. As the test had been repeatedly applied, any replacement test 
would need to be clearly better. Further, as any uncertainty could 
instead be viewed positively,15 enterprises must ensure they undertake 
11 In Lister no test of uniform 
language was adopted, so it 
is important that you identify 
which judge you are referring 
to as this can help show that 
you are aware of that fact.
12 Generally you should avoid 
listing several cases all saying 
the same thing; save time and 
space by just picking the best 
authority to support your point. 
Think quality, not quantity. 
However, here the situation 
is different. The aim is to 
demonstrate the significance 
of the problem with the test by 
showing the repetition of the 
same critical point from the 
highest levels of the judiciary.
13 If this requirement is at 
odds with part of the law’s 
justification then it is hard to 
defend, which leads you into 
a discussion of whether the 
law should have been moved 
on in Mohamud.
15 As above, have the courage 
to express your own view and 
consider whether the issues 
that are suggested as being 
detrimental are in fact so, 
even if they do not feature in 
any judicial comments. This 
allows you to really evaluate 
the merits of the arguments 
relating to the doctrine’s

  Question 1
appropriate and regular checks so those they engage are competent. 
While all wrongful acts may be unforeseeable, organisations have a 
degree of control on events by engaging the individual. It is surely 
good commercial practice to perform adequate risk assessments.
Significantly, Lord Dyson in Mohamud also held that while the law 
needed to be ‘on the move’ in relation to the type of relationship 
required in order to respond to changes in the modern world, there 
was no such societal change which necessitated this second element 
of the law to be ‘on the move’.16 
In conclusion, aspects of the doctrine have been ‘on the move’ in 
order to ensure that the law remains relevant in light of the world in 
which it now operates. This development has been a logical progres-
sion to its traditional operation and without it the law would arguably 
be unjustifiable as claimants could lose out due to technical distinc-
tions between types of working practices, undermining the foundation 
principles of tort. The current approach provides flexibility to ensure 
liability is imposed on those whom it is just to be burdened by it and 
ensure tortious acts are corrected through compensatory payments,17 
spreading losses to those who are most able to bear them.
16 Arguably by this point you 
have addressed this aspect 
of the law and the question 
sufficiently, but by briefly 
including this final point from 
Lord Dyson’s opinion you 
can round off your answer by 
tying it back to the quote and 
highlighting the distinction 
between the two elements of 
the doctrine.
17 This is worded in this 
way, particularly the use 
of ‘corrected’, to link back 
to the idea of corrective 
justice and to reiterate the 
law’s compatibility with 
fundamental principles of tort.

➜ Outline what the purpose of the doctrine is and why it is warranted.
➜ Briefly mention within that context the need for an employee–employer or analogous

■ Simply focus on describing how the law has moved on. You need to consider the validity 
of the moves.
■ Try to establish a definitive explanation and justification for the doctrine. Simply outline 
the basic premise and highlight some of the various factors advanced in support of it.
■ Gloss over the need to discuss the requirement for an employment relationship. Even 
though this has now seemingly been reduced in importance, it is this change which 
really raises questions as to the ongoing justification of the doctrine.

Consider the rationale
for the doctrine

‘close connection’ test
and how it operates
Evaluate the appropriateness of
the test; does it help fulﬁl the
rationale of the doctrine?
Answer
Vicarious liability is the vehicle tort uses to transfer the cost of com-
pensating injured parties from the tortfeasor to their employer. While 
there are long-standing justifications for this, the issue is whether 
once a relationship of employment, or equivalent, is established, the 
close-connection test is appropriate to conclude the matter, or dam-
ages the rationale for the doctrine.1 It is argued that, while lacking 
definitive clarity, the test is effective and allows the doctrine to fulfil 
its purpose in a justifiable manner.
The doctrine imposes strict liability on the employer, irrespective of 
the fact that they have not directly inflicted the claimant’s injury, it 
being caused solely through the actions of an employee. It acts as 
a form of distributive justice ensuring compensation is forthcoming, 
but spreading the loss onto shoulders which are more able to bear 
the loss. This is justified by the courts2 as the employer should be 
protected by insurance and can also absorb costs by passing them 
on to consumers through price increases. This provides, therefore, 
a deterrent factor in ensuring staff are competent and continually 
trained to remain so, as this will make the employer more econom-
ically efficient with better quality products/services and thus more 
competitive in the market place. Another justification is that as the 
employer is taking the benefit from the conduct underway when the 
tort was caused, morally they should also carry the risks.
The doctrine operates in two stages. First, the tortfeasor must be an 
employee of the defendant or be in an equivalent relationship (Var-
ious Claimants v Catholic Child Welfare Society [2012] UKSC 
56). However, the second stage has arguably proved the most con-
troversial. Historically, this stage required the employee to have been

on this specific aspect of 
vicarious liability, make 
sure that you highlight in 
your introduction that you 
appreciate this. The task is to 
stay disciplined and not stray 
into a broader-based answer.
2 If the doctrine does not 
have a justified theoretical 
basis, then there really is 
no argument that the test 
should not apply. Therefore, 
this is the foundation upon 
which you must build your 
answer. Briefly set out why 
the doctrine should apply and 
then you can concentrate on 
the merits of the practical 
application of it.

in the course of their employment when they committed the tort.3 
The purpose of the requirement is to support the rationale for the 
doctrine by providing justification for the shift in liability.4 Otherwise 
the doctrine itself would fall into disrepute if employers have responsi-
bility for acts done outside of their time or for their benefit (N v Chief 
Constable of Merseyside Police [2006] EWHC 3041). Previously, 
judicial consideration focused on5 whether the act was authorised or 
not and, if it was an authorised aspect of their employment, whether 
it was performed in an authorised manner. This was based on the 
proposition that acts relating to the scope of employment which was 
prohibited would not carry liability, but a breach of a prohibition as 
to the manner of performing an authorised act would be within the 
scope of the doctrine (Plumb v Cobden Flour Mills Co. Ltd [1914] 
AC 62). This caused complications over what was the actual scope of 
employment and whether the specific act fell within it, notwithstand-
ing that the scope of employment should be looked at broadly (Rose 
v Plenty [1976] 1 WLR 141). Such a determination was particularly 
difficult to make with regards to intentional wrongdoing.6 
In Lister a children’s home was held vicariously liable for the sex abuse 
by a warden who was an employee. Clearly, he was not even per-
forming his authorised employment in an unauthorised way, let alone 
under express permission.7 It was clearly an illegal act. Lord Steyn8 felt 
that his duties as a warden were ‘inextricably interwoven’ with what 
he did; there was an undertaking by the employer to care for the boys 
and they were abused in the employer’s time, and on their premises, 
creating a close connection. The questions was whether it was ‘fair 
and just’ to impose liability on that basis. It was not the opportunity 
given by the employment that warranted liability but, as Lord Hobhouse 
stated, a relationship had been assumed between the claimant and the 
employer which imposed duties on the latter. The warden had been 
entrusted to perform that duty of care and instead breached it.
The question is whether the close-connection test achieves its pur-
pose or whether its formulation in Lister v Hesley Hall [2002] 1 
AC 215 is detracting from the justifications of the doctrine.9 Giliker 
(2006 and 2010) has repeatedly argued that the lack of definitive 
formulation of a test is causing problems for lower courts, a view 
seemingly reflected by Lord Nicholls in Dubai Aluminium Co. Ltd 
v Salaam & Others [2003] 1 AC 366. Giliker suggests this allows

a sentence such as this, you 
reinforce and justify why you 
have just briefly discussed 
the issue of the need for the 
tortfeasor to be an employee.
4 By stating the purpose of the 
requirement at the start, you 
tie this part of your answer 
to your earlier section and 
you have the foundation for 
assessing the merits of the 
test.
5 While the test is the current 
authoritative approach to the 
issue, you should consider 
what it replaced in order to 
assess whether the move was 
justified.
6 By ending with this 
statement, you highlight 
one of the problems with 
the old approach and flow 
straight into explaining what 
happened in Lister, a case on 
intentional wrongdoing.
7 This links the case to the 
problems identified in the 
previous paragraph.
8 All the judges gave opinions, 
so clearly identify whose 
analysis you are explaining.

135
  Question 2
the doctrine’s application in inappropriate areas. Clearly, the test is 
vague, and legal uncertainty is rarely useful. Employers are left not 
knowing what acts will result in their liability and increased litigation 
could result as parties feel they have an equal chance of success, 
particularly when intentional illegal acts are involved. At the very least 
it affects the employers’ ability to obtain insurance, which removes 
one of the factors which is said to make the transferring of liability fair.
However, taken collectively the opinions in Lister are reconcilable. 
Lord Hutton agreed with Lord Steyn, and there is little difference in 
the language used by Lords Hobhouse and Millett. Although, strictly 
speaking, adopting a different language, they can be reconciled: by 
entrusting the performance of the duty to the warden, it created a 
sufficient connection to make it fair and just to impose liability. All 
emphasised the need for a causal link which, as Lord Clyde noted, 
went back to Salmond’s first account of the doctrine. Further, the 
test provides flexibility, allowing a full consideration of the facts and 
an evaluative judgment made as against the underlying principles 
of compensation, deterrence and loss distribution while drawing on 
precedent where applicable. Indeed, this approach was accepted by 
Lord Nicholls in Salaam owing to the wide variety of situations in 
which the doctrine may operate. He therefore saw an appropriate way 
through the issue highlighted by the question.
Further clarification has also been given in Various Claimants. 
Where tortious acts are clearly committed within the course of 
employment, liability will still result. Beyond that, however, when the 
acts are clearly not part of the tortfeasor’s job, liability will arise where 
it is fair, just and reasonable in light of how closely connected the 
relationship between the defendant and the tortfeasor is with the 
commission of the tort, as that closeness will provide the necessary 
causative link. The creation of risk was said to be an important factor 
and bearing that in mind, employers should be able to make a reason-
able enough assessment in order to facilitate insurance cover which 
may have been a problem post-Lister.10 
Therefore, Giliker’s concerns regarding the lower courts can be over-
come. Lower courts are arbiters of fact. Once they have established 
the full facts of what the employee’s duty was and how the tort 
was committed they have the scope to determine, in light of the 
doctrine’s purpose, whether the two are sufficiently close. If they 
10 It is important that you 
reconsider this point as it 
was advanced as one of the 
objections to the test. You 
need to consider whether 
the clarification given by the 
Supreme Court in the case 
has alleviated the problem 
or not.

are, the requirement maintains the necessary justifiable link to the 
employer to give effect to the doctrine’s rationale. Significantly, when 
asked to abolish the test recently in Mohamud v WM Morrison 
Supermarkets plc [2016] UKSC 11 the Supreme Court declined 
as no societal conditions existed to warrant it in the absence of a 
clearly better test.
Make your answer stand out
■ Learn each opinion in Lister v Hesley Hall [2002] 1 AC 215 and quote the different 
judges’ reasoning to support the argument that they are reconcilable.
■ Consider some of the arguments used in the Canadian case of Bazley v Curry (1999) 
174 DLR (4th) 45, SC (from which the House of Lords took the test) to show a broader 
understanding of its merits in applying to situations such as Lister v Hesley Hall [2002] 1 
AC 215.
■ Draw on Mohamud v WM Morrison Supermarkets plc [2016] UKSC to obtain recent 
quotes in favour of the test and why it should be retained, but also question the validity 
of that decision.
■ Ensure that you always refer your arguments in relation to the test back to the theoretical 
purpose that this aspect of the requirement for vicarious liability is meant to serve.
■ Consider the case of Allen v Chief Constable of Hampshire [2013] EWCA Civ 967 
where there was not deemed to be a sufficiently close connection. This will allow you 
to demonstrate that increased expansion of the doctrine does not automatically lead to 
liability on the part of the employer.

focused on the ‘close-connection’ test as the question requires. You will not impress 
the marker with this wider knowledge and it will suggest that you do not understand the

the test. You will have stated arguments for and against and your answer will end weakly

  Question 3
  Question 3
Brett is an uninsured plumber who gets his work from Brogan Construction. Brett is always 
instructed on what is required for the job and how it should be carried out by the Brogan 
foreman, although he must supply all his own tools, including a van to get to each job; he 
can bring his own labourers to a job but he must pay them out of his wages. Brogan pays 
Brett a daily rate for any jobs but he receives no other benefits.
Recently, owing to a shortage of plumbing work on offer, Brogan arranged for Brett to do 
some work with Hacker Heating Ltd in return for a fee. The job involved fitting a new boiler in 
a residential property, owned by Ted. However, owing to a part turning up late, Brett rushed 
the installation as it was already past his normal finish time with Brogan Construction and 
he had a hangover from the night before and wanted to get to bed. The boiler subsequently 
exploded, killing Ted.
It has been accepted that the boiler was installed negligently and that this caused the explo-
sion; however, Brett has argued that as an employee he should not be held personally liable, 
while Hacker Heating Ltd argue he was certainly not their employee.
Advise Brogan Construction on whether they could be held vicariously liable for Ted’s death.

➜ Explain what the doctrine of vicarious liability is and why it is important to this situation.
➜ Establish whether Brett can be considered an employee of Brogan Construction.
➜ Discuss whether Brett is in the course of his employment.
➜ Evaluate the implications of the work being for Hacker Heating Ltd.

138
7  Vicarious liability
Answer
There is no issue that compensation for Ted’s death is due under 
the tort of negligence;1 the matter to be resolved is simply whether 
Brogan Construction (BC)2 will have to pay this under the doctrine of 
vicarious liability. This rests on whether Brett is actually an employee 
of BC.3 It is argued that while they may have some liability they should 
be able to successfully argue that Hacker Heating (HH) should be the 
predominant contributor of any compensation.
BC should be advised that the reason they face potential liability is 
that the doctrine operates to shift losses so that they are borne by 
those who are most appropriate to do so.4 As employers have set in 
motion matters for their benefit, it is deemed acceptable for them to 
run the risk of their employee’s malfeasance and compensate any 
injuries caused through the work.5 
This explanation forms the basis of the requirements which need to be 
met for an employer to be liable. The first is naturally that the tortfea-
sor is an employee. If they are not, there is no justification behind the 
transferring of liability.6 Traditionally, this is determined by applying 
the control test (Short v J & W Henderson Ltd (1946) SC (HL) 
24). This is significant as the factors considered are the employer’s 
power to select who does the work, their right to control the method 
of work, the paying of wages and their right to suspend or dismiss 
the individual. Applying this to Brett, we can see that BC do choose 
what work he does and dictate how it is performed. While we do not 
know the details regarding the last point, they do pay Brett his wages. 
Therefore, in all, Brett would seem to be their employee.
However, the control test is no longer the sole factor to determine a 
person’s employee status. Reflecting changes in working practices 
and technological developments, it was felt that simply looking at the 
level of control was not appropriate. Instead a range of economic fac-
tors are also considered – the economic reality test (Market Inves-
tigations Ltd v Minister of Social Security [1969] 2 QB 173). 
This requires, among other factors, an assessment of who provides 
the equipment and whether the person can hire helpers. On these 
factors, Brett seems more of an independent contractor, as we are 
told he brings his own equipment and pays labourers from his own 
wages; contractors are also quite common in this field. If Brett is a 
1 Although it is not going 
to need discussing as the 
doctrine can apply to all torts, 
it is worth confirming that 
you are aware of what tort 
Brogan Construction could be 
vicariously liable for.
2 As you have to advise on 
their potential liability, you will 
be referring to them a lot, so 
abbreviate the name.
3 This means that straight 
away you have identified the 
key aspect of the topic to be 
addressed without straying 
into irrelevant material.
4 BC would naturally argue 
they did not do anything 
wrong so why should they 
be liable. Therefore, in a 
question such as this explain 
why the issue of liability even 
arises to illustrate that you 
understand the theory behind 
the doctrine.
5 You need to state enough to 
show that you understand the 
basis for the doctrine, while 
not deviating from a structure 
which the question warrants.
6 The point here is to show 
that you know what the 
purpose of the requirement 
of employee status is, but 
you need to remember to 
frame your explanation in the 
context of giving advice to a 
lay party, i.e. BC.

139
  Question 3
contractor, the doctrine would not apply and BC would avoid liabil-
ity, but there are other economic factors which suggest Brett is an 
employee. Although not told definitively the facts regarding these, it 
seems Brett has no management responsibility and other than wages 
has no opportunity of profiting from the sound management of his 
task. Therefore, while it is possible Brett is not an employee, taken 
as a whole, particularly the element of control exerted over his work, 
it is quite likely that he is.7 
On the basis that Brett is an employee,8 the next issue to advise BC on 
is the fact that at the time of the tort Brett was working for HH. Under 
Mersey Docks & Harbour Board v Coggins & Griffith (Liverpool) 
Ltd [1947] AC 1, the permanent employer of the employee remains 
liable even after lending them to another firm. From the case, the 
decisive factors will be whether BC still pays Brett’s wages and can 
still dismiss him, as well as how long Brett was sent to HH and how 
complex any machinery to be used is. In relation to the latter two 
points, Brett was only there to install a boiler and this was within 
his usual work for BC. As HH paid BC a fee for Brett’s services, it is 
unlikely that they paid him as well; in view of the short duration and 
nature of the job BC should be advised that the facts suggest that 
they would remain liable for Brett’s work.9 
However, BC could benefit from Viasystems (Tyneside) Ltd v Ther-
mal Transfers (Northern) Ltd [2006] QB 510 where the Court of 
Appeal held dual vicarious liability could exist in a situation such as 
this. Liability could be joint or several, with the contributions to be 
made by each side being determined by the Civil Liability (Contribu-
tion) Act 1978. While the court agreed dual liability was permissible, 
the judges gave differing reasoning. The judgment of Rix LJ was 
subsequently endorsed by the Supreme Court in Various Claimants 
v Catholic Child Welfare Society [2012] UKSC 56. A sufficient level 
of integration of the tortfeasor into the second enterprise would be 
needed. Brett would need to be so much of part of both businesses 
that it is just to hold both liable. From what we are told, Brett seems 
to have only been temporarily transferred to HH to perform the job 
of installing the one boiler. The facts suggest that after this job was 
finished, that day, he would return to BC. As such, there is not much 
in the way of integration into HH’s organisation due to the very short 
nature of the transfer; while they may have had some control over how 
7 While the issue may be 
unclear, you do need to 
offer some advice on Brett’s 
status; otherwise you are 
not really answering the 
question, which is to advise 
BC. Highlight what you feel 
is the key factor which may 
swing a decision to support 
your opinion.
8 Reflect the fact that it is 
uncertain by framing the 
opening sentence like this. 
Even if you do not feel Brett is 
an employee, you still need to 
continue to this section on the 
transfer issue as clearly this 
is a key part of the question; 
if you just stop with the 
previous section, there will 
be significant aspects of the 
question and topic which you 
will not have demonstrated 
any knowledge of.
9 This is why it makes more 
sense to refer to Mersey 
Docks first and not just focus 
on Viasystems which comes 
next. If dual vicarious liability 
is possible on the facts, it 
would mitigate BC’s otherwise 
potential full liability.

140
7  Vicarious liability
he worked while there, it does not appear he was working under their 
direction and with their equipment. As such, this is akin to the sort of 
situation that Rix LJ felt would not warrant dual liability, even if HH had 
some control over Brett’s work. At most, BC may be able to obtain a 
contribution to the compensation payable to Ted’s estate if they can 
show that there was sufficient integration of Brett into HH; they would 
not fully avoid liability though if all other requirements are satisfied.
Brett would still have needed to act in the course of his employment.10 
Clearly, as a plumber engaged to install a boiler, the negligent act was 
within his employment. The installation took place after Brett’s normal 
finishing time, but while the tortious act must be performed within 
the authorised employment time, it is clear that Brett extended his 
day in order to finish the job and so will be classed as still within his 
employer’s time (Ruddiman & Co. v Smith (1889) 60 LT 708). The 
fact that Brett would not be authorised to install a boiler negligently 
will also not suffice as the test is simply whether there is a sufficiently 
close connection between the tortious act and his employment to 
make it fair and just for the doctrine to operate (Lister v Hesley 
Hall Ltd [2002] 1 AC 215). This seems clearly satisfied on the facts.
Therefore, the potential vicarious liability of BC will turn on firstly 
whether Brett is deemed to even be an employee of theirs. Even if 
he is, there is a small prospect of arguing that there should be dual 
liability with HH if sufficient integration can be shown, but this appears 
unlikely on the facts.
10 Do not forget this aspect of 
vicarious liability, as without 
it the previous discussion is 
irrelevant. While it seems 
apparent it will be satisfied, 
you do still need to touch on it 
to firmly show that you do in 
fact know it and can apply it.

regulations he has to attend training on equality and diversity at the firm’s training centre in 
Manchester. As it is a contractual obligation to stay up-to-date with such changes George 
was told he would be paid an overnight allowance to stay in Manchester and also that he 
would have all travel expenses reimbursed no matter how he chose to travel. However, staff 
were told that if they drove they must go the most direct route on the motorway.
George decided with his colleague Andrew that they would race each other to 
Manchester seeing as they had both recently bought new sports cars with their bonuses. On

How this topic may come up in exams
Although the tort in question is negligence, it is again a specific application covering 
injuries caused by the claimant’s colleagues, equipment or the system of work 
imposed by the employer. Naturally, there is an overlap with vicarious liability, but this 
area is theoretically distinct as liability is primary in nature, rather than secondary; 
the employer is deemed to have personally committed the wrong. Problem questions 
are more common than essays, but you should check carefully how this area is 
dealt with on your course in relation to vicarious liability and the extent that breach 
of statutory duty is covered alongside the common law duties.

  Question 1
  Question 1
Tucker Reid is the managing director of Supreme Windows Ltd, a window cleaning company. 
The company has recently experienced the following incidents.
Nelson had been a window cleaner with the company for 10 years. Recently he went to 
one of his usual jobs, cleaning windows at a narrow, three-storey town house. Due to the 
height of the top floor windows, an especially long ladder had to be used to reach them; 
however, this took time to set up. Therefore, a local practice had been initiated by Nelson’s 
manager’s whereby the ladder would be set up for one window, and then the cleaner would 
climb onto the window sill from the ladder and then step across onto the next window sill 
to clean the second window, as it was only a distance of a couple of feet. This enabled the 
cleaners undertaking work on that street to get through the houses quicker. One month, 
Nelson reported that the brickwork on one of the window sills appeared loose. The following 
month when Nelson returned, part of the window sill gave way and he turned his ankle try-
ing to maintain his balance. Having recovered and returning to the job, Nelson’s supervisor, 
Jacob, said that it was all fine when someone last went and the local practice could be used. 
However, this time the window sill gave way and Nelson completely lost his footing. The fall 
resulted in multiple fractures.
Lloyd, who is Tucker’s brother-in-law, has been employed by the company for six months. 
However, he has been the subject of numerous complaints from other staff. These have 
ranged from his competence to also being dangerous. In his time with the company, Lloyd 
has caused minor injuries to three staff and had two near misses. On his last shift, Lloyd 
dropped his metal tool used for scraping debris from window sills. This was due to Lloyd not 
using the safety rope on the tool, contrary to company policy. This was the reason for one of 
the previous injuries Lloyd had caused. This time Earl was hit by the tool and suffered brain 
damage.
Advise Tucker on the company’s potential liability for the incidents.

  Question 1
Answer
The issue to advise Tucker on is whether his company will be held 
liable in negligence even though the injuries were the fault of specific 
individuals and so the company was not directly at fault. This will 
involve considering the non-delegable duties an employer owes to all 
staff, which ensures that they cannot escape liability by insisting that 
responsibility for the duty of care in question had been delegated to 
another to discharge.1 It is argued that the relevant duties of providing 
a safe system of work and competent staff2 have been breached.
The historic absence of insurance and a desire to allow emerging 
enterprises to flourish in an unencumbered way meant the courts 
were historically reluctant to burden them with civil liability claims. 
The doctrine of common employment operated so that employees 
were considered to run the risk of injury caused by a fellow employee, 
meaning the doctrine of vicarious liability would not apply (Priestley v 
Fowler (1837) 150 ER 1030). In addition, any personal duty owed by 
the company could be circumvented by delegating the discharging of 
it to another employee. However, as the country became more pater-
nalistic and welfarism started to take hold following each World War 
this regime started to be dismantled. Tucker should be advised that a 
series of non-delegable duties were developed by the case of Wilson 
and Clyde Coal Co. v English [1938] AC 57. These include pro-
viding competent staff, adequate plant and equipment, a safe place 
of work, and a safe system of work, and are owed by the company 
to each employee personally (Paris v Stepney BC [1951] AC 367). 
These were required to reflect the socio-economic and technologi-
cal developments from the industrial revolution and the increasing 
use of potentially dangerous machines in the workplace.3 Further, 
as insurance systems developed, and ultimately became compulsory 
(the Employer’s Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969) in light of 
the increased dangers, it became untenable for employers to simply 
claim they had delegated their personal duty to a competent mem-
ber of staff, whom they had hired with care, to discharge. As such, 
companies are liable for managerial systems failures which result in 
injuries to employees.
1 By discussing this in your 
introduction, you show that 
you have correctly identified 
what specific issue of tort the 
question is addressing and 
have not mistakenly read the 
question as one on vicarious 
liability.
2 Identify what specific non-
delegable duties are at issue. 
This, and the previous point, 
will help create a sense of 
anticipation in the marker 
that they are about to read an 
answer which is on the right 
track.
3 What you want to do here 
is to show that you know the 
duties and understand why 
they are needed. This will 
allow you to explain to Tucker 
why the law may see it as 
justifiable that the company 
be held liable.

148
8  Employers’ liability
The first duty which is of relevance to Tucker is that an employer has 
a duty to provide a safe system of work for their employees to operate 
within. The duty is flexible and covers systems that the employer 
has in place for particular tasks to be performed. It involves training, 
instructing, supervising and, importantly for Tucker, simply issuing 
guidelines.4 The company, through Nelson’s supervisor Jacob, must 
give such general safety instructions as a reasonably careful employer 
who has considered the problem presented by the work would give 
(General Cleaning Contractors v Christmas [1953] AC 180). 
Jacob put in place a system that would enable Nelson to clean more 
windows, more quickly. In principle this would not be a problem; how-
ever, having been injured through that method, Jacob advised Nelson 
to return to the same method of cleaning. Reflecting the non-dele-
gable nature of the duty, Tucker and the company cannot point to 
Jacob’s experience and the fact it was a local practice.5 This was 
explained in Christmas by Lord Oaksey who said workmen are not in 
the same position as employers as the dangers may be obscured by 
repetition. Here the danger was not obscured as Nelson had already 
been injured while performing the task in the way directed by Jacob.
The breach of the duty to provide a safe system of work was the 
clear cause of Nelson’s injury and there is no issue of those injuries 
being too remote.6 This would leave them liable to pay compensation 
unless they can establish a defence. No full defences are applicable, 
but the company could argue that Nelson was contributorily negligent 
which would give them a partial defence and reduce the amount 
of compensation owed to reflect Nelson’s contribution to his injury 
(Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945). However, such an 
argument could be turned on the company as proof of a breach of 
their duty to ensure Nelson was protected from his own carelessness 
(Christmas) and so is unlikely to succeed.
The second relevant duty that the company owes personally is that of 
providing competent staff. This duty extends further than just employ-
ing people who are competent at doing the actual work and extends to 
situations falling outside the ‘course of their employment’ requirement 
of vicarious liability (Hudson v Ridge Manufacturing Co. [1957] 
2 QB 348).7 The issue with Lloyd does focus specifically though on 
4 Give some depth to your 
answer by not only identifying 
the duty in question but 
also subsequently stating its 
scope; by explaining how it 
works you can then draw on 
it when applying the duty to 
the facts.
5 In advising whether the 
duty has been breached and 
can justifiably be attributed 
to the company, make sure 
you cover all of the possible 
arguments.
6 Make sure you do not 
overlook these points even 
though there are no issues 
with them as there is no 
liability without their presence, 
so you need to tick them off 
for completeness. When you 
do, link them back to the 
breach so your answer flows.
7 This allows you to show 
not only that you have 
knowledge of vicarious 
liability but also that you 
have an understanding of 
the relationship of the two 
and when each is more 
applicable.

  Question 1
his ability to conduct his work safely and in accordance with instruc-
tions. While we are not given any information regarding the level of 
competence of Lloyd, but we do know that he is seemingly not very 
experienced and has had numerous accidents in a short space of 
time, significantly injuring three people and one in the same manner 
as Earl was injured. Crucially for Tucker, even if Lloyd had been repri-
manded for his past acts, it is unlikely to be enough to avoid liability. In 
Hudson the employee had been reprimanded several times for play-
ing practical jokes and the company was held liable for not exercising 
reasonable care to bring the jokes to an end when an injury resulted. 
The frequency and similarity of the accidents that Lloyd has caused, 
in such a short period of time, mean that the company is likely to be 
deemed to have breached its duty to Earl to employ competent staff 
even if he has previously been disciplined.
From the facts there are clearly no causation issues.8 Historically, 
the defence of volenti may have applied in that Earl assumed the risk 
of working alongside Lloyd despite his previous record of causing 
injuries. However, this thinking is no longer in line with the modern 
approach to employment relations and the responsibility of employers 
and thus would not succeed.9 If there are further facts of which we 
do not know, such as a failure by Earl to wear safety equipment, 
there may be grounds for saying he was contributorily negligent,10 but 
on the facts given, this does not seem to be applicable and as with 
Nelson it could, in fact, just illustrate a further breach of the duty to 
ensure a safe system of work.11
To conclude, Tucker should be advised that duties are imposed on 
employers to ensure the safety of those carrying out work for them, 
and thus from whom they are benefiting. While it was a local practice 
and there is no evidence it was more widely used, the duty would be 
breached by not ensuring the local practice complied with any safer 
system adopted by the overall company.12 As regards Earl’s injury, by 
not preventing Lloyd from continuing to work, or at least not improving 
his performance, Tucker has failed to employ competent staff.
8 As with the first duty, you 
should just say this clearly 
and concisely. Do not go 
through the motions of 
showing that there are no 
issues on this point. Save 
your time for those points 
which are more at issue.
9 This allows you to show 
that the defence has been 
applied in the past and 
can still be used in some 
circumstances, but illustrate 
your understanding of the 
area by using the theory you 
discussed earlier to show why 
it would not succeed here.
10 There is a slight difference 
here to the causation point 
above. There is nothing 
necessarily wrong in 
throwing a point out if only 
to immediately dismiss it. 
Here though the point may 
be arguable. You are simply 
advising Tucker of the full 
range of possibilities subject 
to the need for further 
information, and at the 
same time showing you fully 
understand the defence by 
recognising its limitations to 
this scenario.
11 You now also have the 
opportunity to link this 
incident to the other duties 
that they owe and show you 
have considered it in the 
round.
12 It is worth including this 
either in the main discussion 
or here as a concluding 
remark as it confirms why 
there is a breach.

  Question 2
workers must comply with British safety standards and have an appropriate safety certifi-
cate. Section 3 simply states that a breach of sections 1 and/or 2 will result in a fine. Due to 
a parliamentary oversight, the Act, and the consequences of a breach, are not mentioned in 
any other legislation.
However, at the time the legislation was passed the garage was struggling financially so 
Otis, the company owner, chose not to purchase goggles with a British safety certificate as 
these were more expensive. Instead, he purchased some from another country with less rig-
orous safety standards. One day, Ray, wearing the goggles supplied by Otis, was working on 
an engine fitting a new mount; however, when taking out the old bolts, one became lodged 
in the mount. Ray managed to force it loose but in doing so it flew up, striking him in the 
eye. As the goggles Otis had bought were not of sufficient safety strength, the bolt cracked 
the lens and blinded Ray.
Also that day, Dobie was working near the entrance of the garage sorting out a tyre delivery. 
However, the way he had stacked the tyres meant he had narrowed the entrance. Booker 
was driving a car into the garage for a service, but the entrance was now too small and tight 
to enter so he hit the tyres which fell onto Dobie leaving him with broken ribs.
Advise Otis of his company’s liability for the injuries to Ray and Dobie.

➜ Determine whether Dobie has been contributorily negligent for his injuries.
Answer
Although Otis was not the direct cause of either injury, the issue which 
arises is whether he will still be liable as their employer1 for breaching 
a statutory duty to Ray and a common law duty of care to Dobie.2
The first issue is whether a civil remedy is permitted. If so, it is sim-
ply a case of establishing whether the elements of negligence are 
satisfied. Alternatively, the Act may expressly exclude civil liability. 
Either way, we are not expressly told. Following the Enterprise and 
Regulatory Reform Act 2013,3 civil liability for breaches of health and 
safety duties provided by ‘existing statutory provisions’ will not arise 
unless expressly provided for in regulations under the Health and 
Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, section 47(2A). As there do not appear 
to be any such regulations providing for civil liability, Otis is seemingly 
without redress. However, the absence of the 2012 Act from any other 
legislation means it would not feature in the list of ‘existing statutory 
provisions’, contained in Schedule 1 of the 1974 Act, meaning the 
2012 Act is outside the scope of section 47(2A) and civil liability may 
be possible.4 However, Otis should be advised that there is still no 
general notion that civil liability arises (Lonrho Ltd v Shell Petro-
leum Co. Ltd (No. 2) [1982] AC 173). Instead the courts exercise 
their discretion in interpreting the Act to determine the matter.
Lonrho held that if the Act provides for penalties, this should gener-
ally be construed as not conferring a right. However, Lonrho identi-
fied exceptions to this general proposition,5 one being where the Act 
was passed to protect a particular class. We are told that the Act’s 
purpose was to protect mechanics after a series of accidents, there-
fore the exception appears applicable. X v Bedfordshire County 
Council [1995] 2 AC 633 supports this, although it also stated that 
Parliament must additionally have intended to grant a private right of 
action on members of the protected class. Where the Act is deemed 
to have ‘social welfare’, the intention to create a private right will not 
exist (Phelps v Hillingdon LBC [2001] 2 AC 619). In relation to this 
Act, while it is aimed at the welfare of mechanics this is a far narrower 
1 This indicates that you have 
identified the area of tort 
covered by the question.
2 This shows that you have 
seen that both aspects apply 
and in relation to which injury.
3 While the main point to 
discuss is the Health and 
Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, 
by referring to this legislation 
you show you are aware it is a 
recent change in the law.
4 Make sure you use the 
facts you have been given to 
explore all possibilities rather 
than making assumptions 
based on the presence 
or absence of certain 
information.
5 Structurally, it is always 
important to state and explain 
the general rule first and 
then explain how there may 
be exceptions to it. Then, as 
you go on to state the factors 
which create the exception, 
ensure that you apply them to 
the facts.

153
  Question 2
class than society at large, as in Phelps. Arguably, it is unjust if an 
Act aiming to prevent injury to a class did not allow injured class 
members to seek a civil remedy.
One reason why the Act may do this is if it expressly provides for 
an alternative remedy, or a better alternative exists elsewhere.6 The 
latter could be where the duty is placed on local authorities whereby 
the claimant would have recourse to administrative law remedies.7 
This is not the case for Otis, and the more significant issue is the fact 
that section 3 states that a breach will result in a fine. This shows 
a remedy is within the Act; however, as Lonrho states, if the Act is 
specifically for the protection of a class, a civil action may still arise.8 
A fine is unlikely to go to the injured mechanics unless it goes to a 
central fund akin to the Motor Insurance Bureau to pay victims. If this 
is not the case, then the mere imposition of a fine would not mean 
it is inappropriate to give rise to a civil action, and indeed where the 
situation relates to workplace safety a more generous approach is 
adopted (Ziemniak v ETPM Deep Sea Ltd [2003] EWCA Civ 636). 
Notwithstanding these considerations, the process has been criticised 
for ultimately coming down to the courts making a policy decision 
on the merits of the case. However, there would not seem to be any 
policy reasons for denying a claim and, on balance, it is likely that the 
duty would give rise to a civil action.
If the matter is actionable in tort, several other requirements must be 
satisfied. However, it is clear that Ray is certainly, as a mechanic, owed 
the duty, and that this was breached, as we are told that Otis bought 
cheap goggles that were not compliant with British safety standards. 
Causation appears satisfied as we are told that the bolt cracked the 
goggles because they were of insufficient strength. On the basis that 
a British standard pair would not have cracked, it is clear that ‘but 
for’ failing to supply the right goggles, as the duty requires, the injury 
would have been avoided. Finally, as the Act specifically mentions 
supplying goggles, it is clear that eye damage was an injury which 
the Act sought to protect mechanics from. Otis should be advised that 
he will not have a defence as even if the Act is not construed as strict 
liability, Ray cannot be said to have assumed the risk or contributed 
to the injury in any way himself as he was wearing what was supplied.
In relation to Dobie, while the Act does not deal with his situation, 
Otis should be advised that as an employer he also has a series of

it is not of primary relevance, 
but provide an example to

8 Be careful not to sound 
repetitive. You are just

point that you made earlier. 
You could alternatively deal 
with this point at the time 
of first raising the general 
proposition.

8  Employers’ liability
non-delegable, personal duties towards each of his employees (Paris 
v Stepney BC [1951] AC 367). These are non-delegable in the sense 
that responsibility for discharging the duty owed cannot be delegated 
to someone else.9 They ensure that the claimant is able to prove an 
action against someone and thus receive compensation (which is 
also aided by compulsory insurance under the Employer’s Liability 
(Defective Equipment) Act 1969). The duties were set out in Wilson 
and Clyde Coal Co. v English [1938] AC 57 and are to reasonably 
ensure competent staff, adequate plant and equipment, a safe place 
of work and a safe system of work.
The relevant duty here10 is the provision of a safe workplace, as Dobie 
was injured after the entrance to the garage was narrowed by the tyre 
wall. The duty requires the employer takes reasonable care to create 
a safe environment, and this extends to entrances11 (Ashdown v  
Samuel Williams & Sons Ltd [1957] 1 QB 409). From the facts, 
Booker crashed through the tyres because the entrance was nar-
rowed, which suggests a breach. It is apparent that if the duty was 
breached it did cause the injury, as the falling tyres broke Dobie’s ribs 
as they hit him. While seeming harsh as the danger was created by 
Dobie himself, the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 
means a reduction in Dobie’s compensation may be possible to reflect 
any contributory negligence on Dobie’s part. By stacking the tyres in 
the entrance so as to restrict it and then continuing to work behind 
the stack, Dobie has indeed been negligent.
Therefore, in conclusion, Otis should be advised that he is likely to be 
found liable for both injuries as he breached his duties owed, although 
the compensation payable to Dobie could be reduced.12

➜ Outline the leading case of Lonrho Ltd v Shell Petroleum Co. Ltd (No. 2) [1982] AC 173, 
explaining its importance.
➜ Discuss the general rule from the case.
➜ Analyse the exceptions that exist to the general rule.
➜ Comment on the merits of the current position.
Answer
The issue to analyse is the manner in which the courts will deter-
mine when someone will be burdened with tortious liability towards 
another private individual when they have breached a statutory duty. 
This involves exploring the rules of statutory interpretation used by 
the courts as the approach taken in interpreting a statute and the 
factors the court considers when doing so is vital to any outcome.1 
These rules are important because quite often statutes are not clear 
on the matter and do not expressly provide for a common law remedy. 
However, as Lord Upjohn suggests, it is common law damages which 
provide the most effective sanction for a claimant injured by a breach 
of a statutory duty. While the courts have consistently held this to be 
a matter of construction, it is argued that the actual decision in each 
case is, in fact, influenced by policy considerations.
The leading case which sets out the framework of how the courts 
will approach this issue is Lonrho Ltd v Shell Petroleum Co. Ltd 
(No. 2) [1982] AC 173. The case concerned losses suffered by Lon-
rho arising from compliance with a sanctions regime created by the 
Southern Rhodesia Act 1965. The subsequent legislative orders made 
it a criminal offence to supply oil to Rhodesia and outlined the punish-
ment for non-compliance.2 However, as Lonrho’s competitors did not 
comply with the order, Lonrho lost out financially. The question was 
whether, in the absence of an express provision of a civil remedy, the 
legislation could be construed as providing one.3 Lord Diplock, giving 
the opinion for the House, noted it had been held since Cutler v 
Wandsworth Stadium Ltd [1949] AC 398 that the matter was one 
of construction of the legislation. His Lordship then proceeded to set 
out the process for undertaking such construction.
1 By setting out the specific 
issue in full here, not only do 
you immediately show your 
marker that you understand 
the question, you also save 
having to repeat it again, such 
as in paragraph 2, and can 
simply refer to ‘the issue’ or 
‘this issue’.
2 Include this point in your 
outline of the facts, as the 
presence of the criminal 
sanctions was a factor 
which influenced the court’s 
decision. Mentioning it now 
will tie in with your discussion 
of this factor later.
3 Do not go into the 
exact details of the case. 
Remember: your aim here is 
just to set out the fact that 
this is the leading case and 
introduce the starting point for 
the court’s approach.

157
  Question 3
The starting point is always what the legislation states; however, the 
problem is that Parliament regularly fails to expressly cover the issue 
when drafting legislation. Consequently, the courts have developed 
a general rule whereby if the Act creates an obligation and specifies 
how it will be enforced, the obligation cannot be enforced in any 
other way. Therefore, where criminal sanctions are provided in the 
legislation, a tortious sanction cannot also be applied to enforce the 
duty. The rationale for this is that Parliament has clearly considered 
the issue of enforcement and remedies for a breach and, while not 
expressly ruling out a tortious action, has expressly opted for another 
form of enforcement.4 The same is also true where a breach of the 
statutory duty will give rise to remedies in administrative law.5 For 
example, where the duty under the legislation is placed on a public 
authority, an action in judicial review will exist. The courts have pre-
ferred this action rather than subjecting the public authority to a tor-
tious action which would reduce the funds available for the operation 
of that authority; at the very least operational costs will rise through 
insurance premiums to cover any potential actions against it in tort. 
This threat of litigation can stifle the operational performance of the 
authority and so is considered against public policy. However, this 
approach perhaps needs reconsidering in light of the restrictions now 
placed on judicial review applications.6
However, Lonrho provided for two exceptions to the general position. 
The first is where the statute is passed to protect a specified limited 
class, as opposed to the public generally. In determining this, it is 
important to consider the purpose of the statute as just because a 
specified class is referred to, it does not automatically follow protect-
ing them was Parliament’s intention. Cutler is a good example:7 the 
Betting and Lotteries Act 1934 provided that bookmakers must be 
given space at dog tracks. However, it was held that the purpose of 
the Act was not to protect the livelihood of bookmakers, but simply 
to regulate proceedings at dog tracks. Therefore, as explained in X v 
Bedfordshire County Council [1995] 2 AC 633, for the exception 
to apply it must be shown that the statute imposed a duty on someone 
for the protection of a limited class and that Parliament intended to 
give members of that class a tort action for a breach of the duty.
The second exception is where the statute creates a right to be 
enjoyed by the general public. While seemingly contrary to the first 
4 It is important to explain the 
reasoning behind this. Use 
this reasoning as the basis of 
your analysis as to whether 
it is right for the courts to 
deny a party the chance of 
obtaining compensation.
5 Include a discussion of this, 
as not all statutes will provide 
for criminal sanctions and so 
it is a different factor within 
the debate. This also allows 
you to get into the treatment 
of public authorities and 
discuss whether they should 
be protected from tort actions 
because of the possibility of 
administrative law remedies.
6 Don’t be afraid to 
demonstrate your knowledge 
of other branches of law 
when there is link to the area 
being discussed, provided you 
keep it to the context of the 
discussion you are having. 
This will show that you have a 
broader level of knowledge of 
the issue and the arguments.
7 Using an example at this 
point demonstrates your 
knowledge of that case 
but also strengthens your 
explanation of how the 
exception operates and what 
is required for it.

158
8  Employers’ liability
exception, it is essential that one of the public then suffers ‘particular, 
direct and substantial’ damage (per Brett J in Benjamin v Storr 
(1874) LR 9 CP 400), which is different from the public generally. 
However, where these are welfare statutes implementing social pol-
icy, the duty is naturally going to be placed on a public authority. 
This brings into play the considerations discussed above regarding 
whether another branch of the law already provides a more suitable 
remedy, such as administrative law.8 The right conferred under the 
duty is part of a wider public policy and not simply a private matter 
between the authority and the individual, and this is why there is a 
strong requirement to show damage beyond that suffered by others 
before the individual tortious right will arise. In O’Rourke v Cam-
den LBC [1998] AC 188, Lord Hoffmann also noted that the wide 
discretion given to authorities under such social welfare legislation 
means that Parliament would have been aware there could be errors 
of judgment and thus unlikely to see these lead to tortious liability.
Therefore, while there is a clear general rule, uncertainty is created 
by the presence of exceptions. This uncertainty arises because there 
is no set formula as to when a case will be deemed to be within an 
exception and the heavy influence of public policy factors. This is 
why the likes of Williams (1960) dismissed the process undertaken 
as a fiction of looking for something which is not there. While this 
has helped employees in industrial situations, it could be said to have 
been unfair on the employer by increasing costs and creating an 
artificial liability.9 Parliament has responded with section 69 of the 
Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 which removes all civil 
liability for breaches of all health and safety duties. Regardless of the 
particular merits of that decision, the approach is in line with reform 
proposals by the Law Commission; namely that a presumption of 
a civil right will exist unless the contrary is clearly expressed in the 
statute. This is a better overall approach.10 Parliament would at least 
be required to fully contemplate the implications of any proposed 
statutory duty, following a debate as to the merits of permitting civil 
liability, and clearly decide what the consequences of a breach should 
be. This would create certainty and reduce the financial burdens of 
litigation and insurance, particularly in light of the growing number of 
regulatory statutes which create duties on parties.
8 By stating that the previous 
material applies here, you will 
not need to repeat that part of 
your answer. The marker will 
already have read your points 
on the matter. This allows you 
to then focus on additional 
points which relate directly to 
this exception.

this, particularly if you are 
adopting the argument that 
this answer does. If you have 
time before you start your 
conclusion, you could use 
this point as the basis of a 
penultimate paragraph and 
explore the positive impact 
that policy can have in more 
detail.

criticising how something 
works, you should offer an 
opinion on how it can be 
rectified. This is particularly 
important if there are 
published proposals for 
reform, as otherwise it

Occupiers’ liability
How this topic may come up in exams
This topic is an extension of the tort of negligence. However, it has its own self-
contained statutory framework governing when a duty will arise, and so you need 
to be careful to recognise whether a problem question is concerned with normal 
negligence or occupiers’ liability. In the question, look for premises which are 
controlled by one of the parties. Although the situations when the duty of care arises 
differ, some aspects are the same, notably causation and remoteness. The Acts 
do not have many sections, but what is needed is located in specific subsections 
so ensure you know these. Problem questions are more common than essays. 
However, when the question is an essay, it tends to focus on whether the legislation 
is necessary and/or whether it achieves the right balance between the parties in 
terms of burden and protection.

  Question 1
  Question 1
Hubert has gone to his council-owned local park with his seven-year-old brother, Cornelius. 
One of the main attractions of the park is an outdoor swimming pool at its centre.
Owing to the hot weather, and the fact that it is quiet, Hubert decides to have a swim; as 
children are not allowed in the pool, he tells Cornelius to wait where he is while he does so. 
However, after five minutes, Cornelius becomes bored and, noticing a newly installed play-
ground, goes off to play on the slide.
Owing to financial restraints, the council had to build the slide cheaply. They employed the 
firm who tendered the lowest amount – Cowboy Construction Ltd. Because of the financial 
restraints, the council did not check to see the quality of their previous work and took at 
face value their claim that they had in fact undertaken such a project. Cowboy Construction 
Ltd had actually never built children’s playgrounds and so made up what they were doing 
as they went along. This meant the slide was very unstable, which an adult would have 
appreciated. When Cornelius reached the top, the extra weight sent the slide crashing down, 
resulting in Cornelius suffering a broken leg.
Advise the council as to their potential liability under the occupiers’ liability legislation.

➜ Identify the status of Cornelius and which Act applies to him.
➜ State what the extent of the duty of care is under the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1957.
➜ Consider whether this is modified owing to Cornelius’s age.
➜ Evaluate the significance of the danger being created by an independent contractor.
➜ Consider whether the council may have any other defences to Cornelius’s claim.
Answer
The council requires advice as to the applicability of the Occupiers’ 
Liability Act 19571 to the current situation. The applicability of the 
Act is important as it imposes liability for the controllers of premises 
towards those who are injured while on those premises, and provides 
for greater care towards children.2 It will be argued that the council 
will have owed Cornelius a duty of care and that they are unlikely to 
be able to rely on the work of the contractors3 to discharge this duty.
Liability under the Act is only imposed on occupiers of premises. While 
not defined within the Act, it has been held to mean the person who 
has such control of premises that they should realise that want of 
care on their part may lead to injury to those coming to the premises 
(Wheat v E Lacon Co. Ltd [1966] AC 552). As the council owns the 
park, and therefore the playground, they would clearly have control 
of the premises.4
The first issue to establish is whether Cornelius would be owed a 
duty under the Act, creating a claim. For this he would need to be 
classed as a ‘visitor’ to the premises. This term covers anyone who is 
permitted by the occupier to be on the premises. The fact that we are 
told that the playground is for children and is within the park suggests 
that, in the absence of any age or entry time restrictions which are 
broken by Cornelius, he would be deemed to be an invitee and thus 
a visitor under the Act (s. 1(2)).
As the council is likely to owe a duty of care, they need to be advised 
next on the extent of that duty. Under section 2(2) this is to take such 
care as is reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that Cornelius 
is safe while using the playground in a manner which is permitted. As 
we are told that Cornelius was using the slide in the normal manner, 
1 Do not wait to show that you 
have identified which Act is 
most relevant to the facts.
2 Show early on that you 
appreciate the purpose and 
the scope of the Act and use 
this to provide the context 
to the issue which you have 
identified.
3 Similarly, show that you 
know what the key issues in 
the Act are in relation to the 
question.
4 While this may seem an 
obvious point, it is important 
that you advise the council 
on it and establish that they 
will be the occupier for the 
purposes of any claim. By 
doing so you also show that 
you have knowledge of the 
point.

165
  Question 1
there is nothing to suggest that he was using the playground in a 
way which would take him outside of his permission for being there.5 
Therefore, as the slide was unsafe for normal usage, it is clear that 
the council have breached their duty to ensure Cornelius’s safety while 
using the playground.
The council might argue that the danger of the slide would have been 
noticeable to an adult and that Cornelius should not have been there 
alone. However, two points can be raised against this assertion. First, 
following Phipps v Rochester Corp [1955] 1 QB 450, in such a 
situation it must be determined whether the council could reasonably 
have expected Cornelius’s unaccompanied presence. More informa-
tion is needed here and evidence will need to be gathered as to the 
extent that children did use the playground unaccompanied.6 If this 
was the case, the council would need to demonstrate that they took 
steps to prevent it from occurring. However, displaying notices saying 
that children must be accompanied at all times may not suffice, as 
the playground could be deemed an allurement7 to children. This 
would mean that Cornelius would remain a visitor and thus owed 
a duty through implied permission (Jolley v Sutton LBC [2000] 1 
WLR 1082), even if certain entry requirements were displayed but not 
complied with. This is because the issue must be viewed in light of 
section 2(3)(a) which provides that the council must be prepared for 
children to be less careful than adults. This would relate to not only 
spotting dangers but also appreciating any warnings. Therefore, they 
should expect Cornelius, as a seven-year-old,8 not to have noticed 
that which an adult would. In view of Cornelius’s age and the nature 
of the premises in question, it would seem likely that the council not 
only owed a duty, but breached it, particularly if there were no entry 
restrictions. In light of the playground being new, guardians are less 
likely to anticipate any danger as it would be reasonable to expect it 
would be safe before opening it to children.
However, the council should be advised that they may have a defence 
of having discharged their duty because the injury resulted from a 
danger caused by an independent contractor. Under section 2(4) the 
occupier is not to be treated as answerable, without more on their 
part, for a danger where it is caused by the faulty construction work 
of an independent contractor and it was reasonable in the circum-
stances to use the contractor.9 The council should be advised that 
5 It is important that you 
illustrate this; otherwise, your 
argument is unsubstantiated 
on what could be a key point 
in assessing the council’s 
liability.
6 Where the facts are too 
vague to give a more concrete 
answer as here, discuss both 
possibilities and if need be tell 
them that more information 
is needed. Remember that 
they are your client, so this 
would be a valid comment 
rather than giving them an 
inaccurate picture. You should 
give them some idea, though.
7 You could discuss this 
above when you discuss 
whether Cornelius is a visitor. 
If you do, then take care to 
ensure that you do not repeat 
yourself.

Cornelius’s age in the facts 
for a reason, so use them to 
build up the strength of your 
argument.

paraphrasing the wording, 
and then to aid your structure

individual components and

in turn.

9  Occupiers’ liability
where the work, here the construction of the playground, requires 
special skill and equipment which they do not possess, then it will 
be reasonable to engage the contractor (Maguire v Sefton MBC 
[2006] EWCA Civ 560). This would seem applicable to the situation 
here; however, the council should be advised that the subsection goes 
on to state that the occupier may also have to have taken reasonable 
steps to ensure that the contractor was competent for the task, and 
the work was properly done. This would be a reasonable step here, 
as it would be clear that failure to check the quality of the work would 
pose a danger to users of the playground. As we are told that an adult 
would notice the slide was dangerous and yet the playground was 
open, it is clear the work was not checked upon completion by the 
council. This, when combined with the fact that, although the council 
inquired as to the contractor’s competency, they did not verify the 
information, would suggest that the council will probably be held to 
have not discharged their duty.
In conclusion, the council will have owed Cornelius a duty of care, and 
their failure to check the competency of Cowboy Construction Ltd and 
the quality of the work upon completion will result in them being in 
breach of that duty. There do not appear to be any issues of causa-
tion or remoteness10 and, therefore, the council should be advised 
that they will be liable for Cornelius’s injury. They should be further 
advised that even if Cornelius was not deemed to be a visitor under 
the 1957 Act, they could well be liable under the Occupiers’ Liability 
Act 1984 as a non-visitor.11 The slide was in a dangerous state and 
they arguably had reasonable grounds to know this, as it had been 
constructed by a firm whose work had not been checked. There would 
also be reasonable grounds to believe that unaccompanied children 
might go on the slide and, owing to the nature of the danger, it was a 
risk which was reasonable for them to protect against.
10 As this is still an aspect of 
negligence, do not forget to 
touch on these issues.

have left, you could include 
this within the main body

  Question 2
  Question 2
Noel is a saxophone player who has a licence to practise in the hall of the pub which his 
friend Paul owns and runs. Recently, Noel has had his 10-year-old brother, Liam, stay with 
him and so he had to bring Liam with him one night. The entrance to the pub has a large 
notice stating that no children are allowed inside due to renovation work, although they are 
usually allowed in. Noel saw the sign and thought that it would be alright as it would be quiet 
and he would keep an eye on Liam. As they entered, Noel said hello to Paul, who greeted 
Noel in return, but, not having seen Liam as he was busy, said nothing about his presence.
During Noel’s practice, the fire alarm sounded and Paul shouted for everyone to leave imme-
diately. Noel quickly got his things together before heading for the exit at the end of the 
corridor. However, Paul, who had been carrying out some refurbishment work in the corridor 
when the alarm went off, had left some tools on the corridor floor. Noel did not notice and 
slipped on a screwdriver, severely injuring his back to the extent that he could not get up. 
As the alarm was still going off, Liam panicked and ran for the door to get help, but Paul had 
locked it to stop people going back inside until it was time. Remembering a fire exit in the 
hall, Liam ran to that exit, but as he got to the door fell through some rotten floorboards and 
ruptured his ankle ligaments.
Advise Paul about the two injuries.

applicable, or want to discuss it for completeness, do so at the end once you have 
advised the council fully on the 1957 Act, or you will lose your structure.
■ Use the facts of the question as much as possible to build and support your argument.
■ Use academic opinion from your reading as well to support your interpretation of the 
facts, particularly where you do not have a case authority, such as with regard to the

Answer
The issue to be determined is whether Paul will be liable to Noel and 
Liam for the injuries that they have suffered while on his premises. 
He will need advice as to potential claims under both the Occupiers’ 
Liability Act 1957 (the 1957 Act)1 regarding lawful visitors to prem-
ises, and the Occupiers’ Liability Act 1984 (the 1984 Act) which 
governs injuries to non-visitors.2 Which Act applies is important, as 
the law provides far greater protection for visitors. It will be argued 
that, despite being told to leave, Noel is still likely to have been owed 
a duty as a visitor and be successful in a claim, whilst Liam will be a 
non-visitor and is less likely to be successful.

  Question 2
First, it should be established that Paul will face any action as the 
occupier of the premises. Whilst ‘occupier’ is not defined in either 
statute, it was stated in Wheat v E. Lacon Co. Ltd [1966] AC 552 
that occupiers are those with such control over the premises that 
they should realise that want of care on their part may lead to injury 
to those coming to the premises; as the owner of the pub, Paul would 
have such control.3
In advising Paul about Noel’s injuries first, it must be confirmed 
whether Noel was a ‘visitor’ for the purposes of the 1957 Act. This 
term is also not defined in the Act; however, section 1(2) does pro-
vide that it covers the common law terms of ‘invitee’ and ‘licensee’. 
Therefore, anyone who is lawfully on the premises will be a visitor. 
As Paul had given Noel permission to use the hall, Noel will satisfy 
the definition of a visitor. This is significant for Paul as any duty owed 
under the 1957 Act is more rigorous and increases his chances of 
being liable for Noel’s injuries.4
The extent of the duty Paul will owe to Noel as Paul’s visitor is pro-
vided by section 2(2),5 and it is to ensure that he takes such care in 
all the circumstances so that Noel is safe while using the premises 
for the purposes for which he is allowed. Significantly, this indicates 
that the duty only extends to ensuring safety during permitted activ-
ities. However, Noel suffered his injury after having remained on the 
premises after he had been told to leave because of the fire alarm. 
Therefore, Noel was not technically permitted to be there at that time. 
However, Paul should be advised that people are given a reasona-
ble time to vacate premises after having their permission withdrawn  
(Cornish v Stubbs (1870) LR 5 CP 334). As this was a fire alarm, 
Noel should have left straight away, but depending on exactly how 
long he took, if the timeframe was deemed reasonable, a duty under 
the 1957 Act will be owed. Further, the facts suggest that Paul 
breached his duty by leaving obstacles on the corridor floor which 
then clearly caused the injury.6
The fact that the alarm was going off may negate any argument that 
Noel was negligent himself when leaving in not having seen any haz-
ards. We are not told of any warning signs either, other than the 
notice saying children were not permitted due to the renovation work. 
Paul should be advised that, under the 1957 Act, to discharge a 
duty a notice must specify the danger and be sufficient to keep the

important in a statute-based 
tort that you constantly refer 
to which part of the Act deals 
with the point in question in 
order to demonstrate your 
knowledge and give strength

main focus of the question is 
whether a duty is owed under 
the Act, to be liable all of the 
other aspects of negligence 
need to be satisfied.

visitor reasonably safe (s. 2(5)). It is unlikely that any sign would be 
so worded as to keep a visitor reasonably safe from trip hazards of 
the kind which Noel suffered, especially as this is the main walkway. 
Further, Paul should be advised that the notice is to be judged in all 
circumstances. As there was a fire alarm going off, this may count 
against the sufficiency of any notice, as naturally Noel was looking 
to just vacate the premises as soon as possible.7 Arguably, the duty 
would be heightened as it was incumbent upon Paul to ensure that 
people could leave safely. It would also probably rule out any other 
defence from the Act, such as voluntary assumption of risk, apply-
ing against Noel as he was naturally trying to leave the building as 
requested.
Regarding Liam, it is clear that as children were not permitted due to 
the renovation work his situation can only fall within the 1984 Act, so 
he will be assessed as a non-visitor. Although nothing was said when 
Liam entered, any argument based on an implied licence will fail as 
Paul had not noticed him enter.8 Paul should note that the 1984 Act 
provides that a duty will be owed to non-visitors for the risk of injury 
by way of the dangerous state of the premises or by things done on 
them or omitted to be done (s. 1(1)). The danger here was the broken 
floorboards by the fire exit.
Paul should be advised that, for him to owe a duty under section 
1(3) of the 1984 Act, he would need to be aware9 of the state of the 
floorboards, which as the owner he must be, as the area by a fire 
exit is open and therefore noticeable. Paul would also be the person 
responsible for checking that the premises, including fire exits, are 
secure. Further, their location also means it is a danger from which it 
is reasonable to expect Paul to offer protection as it will be how people 
try to leave in an emergency.10 However, the duty is determined by the 
reference to the likely presence of the actual non-visitor in the vicinity 
of the danger at the time and place of the danger to him (Ratcliffe v 
McConnell [1999] 1 WLR 670). Therefore it will be difficult for Liam 
to establish that Paul had reasonable grounds to know that Liam was 
in the vicinity at that time. As children were not permitted and he did 
not see Liam enter the pub with Noel, who he would know would be in 
the vicinity of the danger, it is hard to see how Paul would have known 
that a child would be in the vicinity at the time Liam was injured. As 
such, it is unlikely that Liam satisfies the requirements to be owed a 
duty in this case.
7 As this indicates you are 
not dealing with a normal 
situation, use it to evaluate 
the factual situation in a bit 
more depth rather than just 
quickly reaching a conclusion 
on the issue.
8 From the facts we are told 
that Paul did not see Liam, so 
use this to support how there 
is no chance of Liam being 
able to argue that he was a 
visitor.
9 Although paragraph (a) 
and paragraph (b) within 
the subsection discuss 
reasonable belief as an 
alternative to actually 
knowing, as the latter is 
actually the case in the 
scenario, do not feel the need 
to explain the full extent of the 
paragraph.
10 While this is paragraph 
(c) of section 1(3) state it 
first as it is more likely to be 
satisfied than paragraph (b). 
This will give your answer 
a more logical structure as 
you will not be discussing an 
uncertain element which is 
more likely to be unsatisfied, 
and then going on to the next 
requirement and saying how 
that one is satisfied.

171
  Question 3
In conclusion, Paul should be advised that Noel is likely to have a 
successful claim under the 1957 Act as he left hazards in the main 
walkway from the hall to the exit and knew that Noel would be using 
that route. Paul may have more success against any claim by Liam, as 
he would not have had grounds to believe Liam was on the premises, 
and so not owed him a duty of care.
  Question 3
‘The working paper evoked a very wide and diverse response. A few of those commenting 
considered that no reform of the law was desirable, and among the majority who did 
consider that was desirable, there was again a wide spectrum of views as to the desired

  Question 3
Answer
The issue to consider is the necessity for Parliament to intervene in 
the area of occupiers’ liability in light of the protection initially offered 
by the common law. This requires exploring the need for Parliament’s 
first intervention in 19571 as arguably the 1984 intervention was 
needed to redress issues which were not dealt with by the 1957 
Act. As such, it is argued that both interventions were needed. While 
there remains unequal protection between types of people entering 
the land, the current2 distinction is justifiable. As such, intervention 
taken as a whole has been successful meaning no further legislation 
is needed.
Before 1957, the common law offered a protection through imposing 
a duty of care to those entering the land. The scope of this varied 
depending on the classification given to the injured individual and 
was determined by their reason for being on the premises and ranged 
from those present under a contract with the occupier through to 
trespassers. In between were invitees and licensees, those with an 
invitation or permission from the occupier to enter. While similar, a 
distinction was made based on the invitee’s common interest with 
the occupier for being on the premises resulting in greater protection. 
This was overly, and unnecessarily, complex with litigation focusing 
on determining the relevant status. The artificial nature of the distinc-
tions led a Law Commission Report of 1954 to call for its abolition.3 
The report led to the 1957 Act which had the primary purpose of 
simplifying the law, and creating certainty as to how and when a duty 
would arise.4 Section 1(2) replicated the meaning of ‘occupier’ from 
the common law namely the person who has sufficient control over 
the premises so that they ought to realise that a failure of care on 
their part may lead to injury to another (Wheat v E. Lacon Co. Ltd 
[1966] AC 552). While defined in the same way, the duty owed was 
the same for all lawful visitors. Consequently, the difficulty of deter-
mining a person’s status and their level of protection was generally 
removed. However, consequently, trespassers at common law still 
lacked protection unless any injury resulted from deliberate intentional 
acts of the occupier or acts which were done with reckless disregard 
for the trespassers’ presence (Addie v Dumbreck [1929] AC 358). 
1 It is important that you 
mention this in your 
introduction as the quote does 
not expressly mention the first 
statute. However, properly 
understood, the rationale for 
the second intervention by 
Parliament is inherently linked 
with the objective behind the 
first intervention. As such, 
you need to address each 
intervention in the appropriate 
context and relate them. By 
explaining that you appreciate 
this, you will let your marker 
know that you understand what 
is expected by the question.
2 Obviously there was a 
distinction before the 1957 
Act so you need to make clear 
that you are talking about the 
current position of the law 
whether you agree with the 
state of the law or not.
3 The point which you should 
be trying to convey here is the 
need for the legislative reform 
and why the common law 
was, therefore, unsatisfactory. 
This will set up your 
discussion of the 1957 Act.
4 For the purposes of fully 
answering the question, it is 
important that you highlight 
what the Act was trying to 
do. This is because this will 
influence your concluding 
arguments on the state of the 
law, namely that both Acts 
sought, on policy grounds, to 
build in a distinction between 
the levels of protection offered. 
Therefore, there is no need for 
further legislation on that basis.

174
9  Occupiers’ liability
No protection was given from negligent acts, as the view was taken 
that trespassers came onto the premises at their own risk.5
While the 1957 Act successfully simplified the law by equalising the 
protection for all lawful visitors, it did create a new debate regarding 
when someone was lawfully on the premises, especially in relation 
to children.6 Following Jolley v Sutton LBC [2000] 1 WLR 1082 a 
duty may be owed to a child if the premises contain an allurement 
which could equate to granting implied permission to enter. In Jolley 
a rotting boat on the premises was deemed an attractive plaything 
for children and was easily accessible to them. The year of the case 
demonstrates that this was not simply an issue prior to Parliament’s 
second intervention and is linked to the long-standing distinction 
between lawful and non-lawful visitors.7 The issue is complicated 
by the diverse range of people who could fall within the meaning of 
trespasser. However, the case demonstrates that the courts can deal 
with this complication fairly.8
The duty owed is to take such care as is reasonable in the circum-
stances to ensure that the visitor is reasonably safe using the prem-
ises for the purpose for which they are permitted to be there (s. 2(2)). 
Therefore, acting inconsistently with the permission given, results in 
the Act’s protection being lost. The occupier is also permitted to alter 
their duty through contract, albeit subject now to the Unfair Contract 
Terms Act 1977. Some allowance is still made for the type of visitor 
with section 2(3)(b) providing the occupier can expect those on the 
premises exercising their trade to guard against its inherent risks. 
Conversely, children must be expected to exercise less care than 
adults (s. 2(3)(a)). Although seemingly justifiable, in light of the readi-
ness to find implied licences for children, a greater burden is created 
5 Naturally, building from the 
previous comments, you 
then need to explain what 
the policy reason is for the 
distinction which the 1957 
Act left.
6 It is important that you 
evaluate the merits of what 
the Act set out to do and its 
consequences; otherwise, 
you risk just having a 
description of it. Mentioning 
this here allows you to set 
the foundations for your 
discussion around the need 
for the 1984 Act.
7 This is why Jolley is a good 
case to give as an example 
here, as opposed to other 
famous cases such as Phipps 
v Rochester Corp [1955] 
1 QB 450 and Glasgow 
Corporation v Muir [1943] AC 
448. It allows you to evaluate 
whether this was just a pre-
1984 issue.
8 A concluding remark such 
as this is needed if you are 
building to a conclusion that 
no further reform is needed. 
Without it, you have left an 
unanswered question mark 
over the adequateness of 
the law.

175
  Question 3
towards people who arguably should not be on their premises, par-
ticularly unsupervised.9
This matter came to a head in British Railway Board v Herrington 
[1972] AC 877 where a duty was found towards a boy injured tres-
passing over a railway line between two dilapidated fences.10 While 
decided unanimously, the judicial opinions lacked clarity as to when 
this duty would arise and its extent. This naturally caused significant 
uncertainty and detriment for landowners who now faced liability for 
people not allowed on their land. As a result, the Law Commission 
produced another report in 1976 which led to Parliament’s second 
intervention in 1984.
The 1984 Act sought to achieve a better balance between not exces-
sively burdening occupiers in respect of trespassers, while imposing 
liability in circumstances when they could fairly be deemed at fault 
for injuries suffered on their premises.11 Section 1(1) imposes a duty 
to non-visitors in respect of injuries suffered while on the premises 
by reason of a danger arising from things done or omitted to be done 
on the premises. In only imposing a duty in these circumstances, the 
1984 Act clearly offers less protection than the 1957 Act.
Before a duty is imposed though the requirements of section 1(3) 
must be satisfied.12 The occupier is aware of the danger or has rea-
sonable grounds to believe it exists; he knows or has reasonable 
grounds to believe the other, regardless of lawful authority, is in the 
vicinity of the danger, or may come within it and the risk is one which, 
in the circumstances, it is reasonable to expect him to protect the 
other from. If satisfied, the duty is to take such care as is reasonable 
in the circumstances to see that injury from that danger does not 
occur. There is no duty for injury by other means reflecting Parlia-
ment’s intention to distinguish the protection given to non-visitors in 
contrast to visitors.
9 This links the discussion 
back to the previous mention 
of this aspect of the issue and 
so gives it more strength. Of 
more importance though is 
that commenting on this here 
allows your answer to flow 
nicely and directly into why 
the 1984 Act came about. 
To maintain a good structure, 
you need to ensure that you 
do not just simply move on to 
describing what the 1984 Act 
does; set up your discussion 
with some context. Therefore, 
while the provisions of the 
1957 Act could be dealt 
with before the paragraph 
evaluating its success you 
would need to take extra care 
to ensure you maintain a 
good flow through the answer 
which still raises all of the 
issues here. Your answer 
would need to be structured 
differently in its entirety to 
this one.
10 This fact was important to 
the decision as it warranted 
some fault being placed on 
the defendant, so it is equally 
important that you highlight it.
11 By explaining the point of 
the Act, you highlight your 
understanding of both Acts 
as the intention was never to 
offer the same protection as 
the 1957 Act due to policy 
considerations.
12 Put these in a separate 
paragraph so that the analysis 
and evaluation that you offer 
previously does not get lost in 
the detail.

176
9  Occupiers’ liability
Therefore, Parliamentary intervention was necessary due to the 
unsatisfactory state of the common law.13 However, by failing to deal 
with all the categories of individuals which existed at common law in 
1957, Parliament simply created new problems which necessitated 
the second intervention in 1984. This was surely foreseeable and 
the intervention would have been more successful if the law was 
reformed in its entirety in 1957. The situation has now been recti-
fied and although there is unequal protection between visitors and 
non-visitors, the differing policy objectives behind each statute justify 
the distinction so there is no need for a further intervention to level the 
playing field. Further, the lack of reported appeal cases suggests that 
the judiciary have also reached a clear and settled understanding as 
to the purpose and application of each statute.14 Therefore, ultimately, 
Parliament’s interventions have been successful when taken together.
13 Start your conclusion with a 
definitive statement as to the 
overall merit of the sentiment 
expressed within the quote 
within the question, and then 
proceed to summarise why 
you have reached that view.
14 There are arguably two 
reasons for possible reform, 
one that the different 
treatment is unwarranted; 
or, secondly, that the 
law remains unclear and 
ambiguous. This shows 
that you are aware of and 
have considered both. Also 
by referring to the lack of 
appeal cases, which would 
generally deal with the second 
issue, you demonstrate your 
knowledge of the current 
state of the law and judicial 
thinking.
Make your answer stand out
■ If you conclude the interventions have not been successful, consider what reforms are 
needed to rectify the situation.
■ Consider the impact of the Compensation Act 2006 on this area of law and whether that 
suggests that Parliament was not happy with the prior situation.
■ Read the Law Reform Committee (1954) Third Report: Occupiers’ Liability to Invitees, 
Licensees and Trespassers and the Law Commission Report (1976) Report on Liability 
for Damage or Injury to Trespassers and Related Questions of Occupiers’ Liability to gain 
a full insight of the primary reasons for each statute.
■ Read British Railway Board v Herrington [1972] AC 877 and formulate your own views as 
to the extent, if any, it created problems in the law in relation to trespassers.
■ Supplement your arguments with academic opinion and judicial comments on the 
legislation, looking at cases such as Tomlinson v Congleton Borough Council [2004]  
1 AC 46.

177
  Question 3
Don’t be tempted to . . . 
■ Ignore the 1957 Act even though the quote in the question is from the report that 
considered the need for Parliamentary intervention by way of the 1984 Act. An omission 
in this regard would suggest that you lack understanding regarding the relationship 
between the two statutes and the full background of the later Act.
■ Extensively discuss the different provisions of each statute. The question is focused on 
you evaluating the need for each Act and the extent that, overall, they provide adequate 
protection. Focus on a comparative evaluation of each rather than a description of each.
■ Go into detail on the full elements of negligence, particularly when setting out how 
liability occurred at common law.
Try it yourself
Now take a look at the question below and attempt to answer it. You can check your 
response against the answer guidance available on the companion website  
(www.pearsoned.co.uk/lawexpressqa).
Marmaduke was a landscape gardener and one of his clients was De Hav 
Investments plc who have a garden on the top of their office block. The last time 
Marmaduke went there he noticed that there was not much work that needed 
doing, so to save time he did not put up the safety netting around the roof. As 
Marmaduke was re-potting some plants, he put all his weight down on a paving 
slab at the edge of the roof. However, the slab was broken and as he did so the 
slab came loose. This resulted in Marmaduke losing his balance, causing him 
to fall over the edge. He was killed instantly upon hitting the ground. De Hav 
Investments plc knew that the paving slabs around the edge of the roof needed 
repairing but did not say anything, as they thought Marmaduke would adopt 
suitable safety measures, being as experienced as he was. There was a sign on 
the door to the roof though that simply said ‘DANGER!’
Advise Marmaduke’s wife, Henrietta, if she has a claim against De Hav 
Investments plc.

Trespass to land
How this topic may come up in exams
Trespass to land is a rather small and uncomplicated area and, as such, means 
that essay questions are rare. However, you could be asked about the need for the 
tort and the role it plays in the wider context of protecting interests in land. As for 
problem questions, it is common to find an element of trespass to land combined 
with other torts such as trespass to the person, occupiers’ liability or nuisance. 
Always check your question to see whether there is an aspect of someone entering 
another’s land without permission or acting in a manner which is inconsistent with 
their permission.

  Question 1
  Question 1
Harry recently purchased an old mansion in the village of Snapeton, which has significant 
historical interest for the local community. Feeling philanthropic, Harry opened parts of the 
mansion and grounds up to the public and turned some of the rooms into a museum. The 
rest forms Harry’s private residence. Entry is free, but visitors must have a valid ticket, which 
lists the conditions of entry. These are also repeated on various signs.
To help advertise the new museum, Harry placed a large sign at the end of the driveway; 
however, this protruded slightly onto the land owned by Tom. Tom has repeatedly asked for 
this to be moved, but Harry dismisses him saying the sign must be protruding ‘by a matter 
of inches’ and to ‘get over it, boy’. Furious, one night Tom threw a large rock at the sign, but 
missed, smashing a window in an outhouse of Harry’s.
Besides the incidents with Tom, Harry has also suffered additional difficulties.
Some of the conditions of entry to the mansion are that the grounds are no smoking, food is 
prohibited and no photography is allowed. During a tour of the grounds Harry caught Brian 
eating by the ornamental pond and saw cigarettes on the ground. Harry demanded that he 
leave, but Brian shouted that he ‘would be back as you can’t stop me coming’.
Molly was leaving the grounds after a visit. Despite a sign saying that she could exit through 
the east road, Molly wanted to leave by the north road and thought as it was not blocked off 
it must still be OK. Missing a sign saying ‘No Exit, Road Under Repair’, Molly proceeded up 
the north road, hit a divot in the road, lost control of her car and crashed. This resulted in 
Molly damaging some fencing.
Advise Harry on these events and what action may result.

➜ Define what is meant by trespass to land.
➜ Establish that Harry and Tom have possession of their respective land so that each may 
bring a claim.
➜ Examine each incident of trespass complained of in turn as to whether it was voluntarily 
directed at the land.
➜ Consider any possible justification for each interference.
➜ Advise Harry as to what remedy he should seek in relation to the different actions directed 
at his land.

  Question 1
and Jolowicz on Tort (Rogers, 2010)1 as the unjustifiable interference 
with the possession of land, and Harry should be advised that it is 
actionable without any proof of damage. This is important in this 
scenario, as not all of the incidents have led to any physical damage; 
rather, they have resulted in mere disturbance. It will be argued that 
Harry is likely to have an actionable claim against Tom, Brian and 
Molly, but could also face claims from Tom and Molly.
The first issue to determine is that Harry can actually bring a claim2 
for trespass.3 Although a lawful estate is not required, physical pres-
ence on the land is insufficient to bring a claim, there must be actual 
possession. As Harry owns and lives in the property,4 he has the 
necessary possession. Similarly, Tom also has standing to make a 
claim against Harry in relation to the sign.
In dealing with the dispute with Tom first, Harry should be advised 
that the fact that Tom does not enter Harry’s land will not prevent 
an action for trespass, as the authority of Smith v Stone (1647) 
Style 65 states throwing a stone onto another’s land will suffice; this 
clearly mirrors the facts here. Further, as we are told that Tom did this 
due to being ‘furious’ with Harry’s comments, this suggests it was 
clearly an intentional act directed against Harry’s land, which cannot 
be justified.5 As Tom has no defence, Harry would be successful in 
obtaining damages. There seems to be no reason for an injunction 
at this time unless repeated instances were likely. However, Harry 
should be advised that he is similarly liable to a claim of trespass by 
Tom even though he may not have entered Tom’s land. The case of 
Kelsen v Imperial Tobacco Co. [1957] 2 QB 334 involved a sign 
overhanging the claimant’s land by a small amount, and the tort was 
held to be made out as one’s land extends skywards. Harry should 
be advised that even though there is no damage caused by the sign, 
liability reflects the premise that one’s land should be inviolate, espe-
cially from intentional acts of interference.6
In relation to Brian, Harry should be advised that, as required, there is 
clearly an immediate, direct and intentional interference with his land 
as he has voluntarily entered the grounds. As he is in an area where 
he has permission to be, at first glance it appears this is a justifiable 
interference, as Brian has a contractual licence to be there. However, 
Harry should be advised that, where a licence is given to someone, 
conditions can be attached. This has occurred here as conditions of 
1 You will not be expected to 
put a full reference in your 
answer but you should try to 
put some information down, 
such as the year if it is a book 
or the journal abbreviation if it 
is a journal.
2 Clearly, it would not be 
much of a question if Harry 
did not have standing to bring 
a claim, but for completeness 
you should demonstrate your 
knowledge of the point.
3 As the question does 
not have any element of 
trespass to the person, you 
can shorten the name of the 
tort, as there is no need to 
distinguish it from trespass to 
the person.
4 Use the facts of the question 
to support why he will have 
possession and thus standing.
5 Obviously, you are not 
expressly told this, so 
this makes it all the more 
important to draw on the facts 
of the question to support the 
proposition.
6 As Harry was quite 
dismissive of Tom’s complaint, 
and felt it was doing no 
harm due to the small nature 
of the infringement, it is 
important that you offer some 
explanation as to why he 
faces liability.

184
10  Trespass to land
entry and, therefore, conditions for obtaining a licence to be on his 
grounds, are that visitors must not smoke, take photographs or eat 
whilst on the grounds. The presence of these conditions also indicates 
that, even though Brian has a contractual licence, it can be revoked 
without Harry being in breach of contract.7 As Brian has broken these 
conditions, his presence, even in a permitted area, is inconsistent with 
his permission to be there and so this will be a trespass. Harry should, 
however, be advised that normally where a licence is revoked, the 
licensee must be given a reasonable time to collect their goods and 
leave (Cornish v Stubbs (1870) LR 5 CP 334). Thus, there would 
be no action against Brian unless he took an unreasonably long time 
to leave. However, as Brian’s entry was in breach of the entry con-
ditions, this will be deemed to be a trespass from the moment that 
he entered Harry’s property.8 Additionally, as we are told that this 
has happened repeatedly, Harry should be advised that he may want 
to seek a permanent injunction as a remedy rather than just merely 
damages as this will, despite what Brian claims, prevent him from 
entering the grounds.9
The situation with Molly is slightly different to that with Brian, and the 
question is whether her presence on the road was justifiable, i.e. did 
she have permission to be on that part of the grounds. We are not 
told whether there was an entry condition regarding how to leave the 
grounds. However, the signs stating that people were not to exit via 
the north road can be said to signify that entrants did not have permis-
sion to be on that road. If there is no permission to use that exit, then it 
could be argued that there was no permission to use the road leading 
to the exit. Harry should be advised that this lack of permission could 
have been made clearer but, if Molly were to argue that she did not 
intend to trespass by using the road as she did not know the exit 
was not in use, this would be irrelevant as it must be the act of entry 
which is intended, which it clearly was as Molly intended to take that 
exit. Even a mistaken entry amounts to trespass (Conway v George 
Wimpey & Co. Ltd [1951] 2 KB 266). Therefore, as Molly directly, 
immediately and intentionally drove along the north road without per-
mission, this would constitute a trespass. As Harry has suffered injury 
to his property from the incident, the most appropriate remedy would 
be damages and there would seem little point in an injunction in this 
instance.10 Further, the existence of actual property damage means 
7 Although clearly not an issue 
of the question, you should 
show your wider knowledge of 
the related areas to trespass 
as you are advising an 
individual, and in real life this 
may be an issue.
8 While this latter point 
seemingly makes the previous 
point regarding Cornish 
irrelevant, it is still worth 
mentioning that authority as it 
shows not only that you know 
that aspect of the law, but 
also understand it within the 
context of the question by not 
applying it.
9 Use the facts to lead you 
into a discussion of the 
appropriateness of the tort’s 
remedies, which will allow 
you to show the full range 
of your knowledge and 
understanding.
10 A line such as this just 
reinforces the extent of your 
knowledge and shows your 
awareness of the differences 
in the types of remedies 
available.

185
  Question 1
Harry could alternatively claim damages under negligence against 
Molly if there were concerns as to whether permission for being on 
the north road had been withheld.11 Harry should be advised though 
that, if Molly suffered an injury in the crash, she might have a possible 
claim against him under the occupiers’ liability legislation, even if 
she was trespassing on the road. He would have a strong chance in 
defeating such a claim though, or having a partial defence of contrib-
utory negligence, at least.
To conclude, it would appear that Harry has an actionable claim for 
trespass against all of the parties, but he faces a claim for trespass 
by Tom; however, he should succeed in defeating any claim by Molly.
11 Although the question is 
clearly focused on trespass, 
the rubric gives you scope 
to explore other torts, so 
take the opportunity to show 
your wider knowledge of tort 
and how different torts may 
feature on similar facts.
Make your answer stand out
■ Discuss the theoretical basis of trespass to illustrate to Harry why he would still be liable 
even if the sign is only protruding by a couple of inches, but counter this by looking at 
A.H. Hudson (1960) ‘Nuisance or trespass’. Modern Law Review, 23: 188 and whether 
Kelsen v Imperial Tobacco Co. [1957] 2 QB 334 is compatible with other authorities.
■ Explain in detail how Harry might get an injunction if he wanted one.
■ Consider in more detail the possible claim in negligence against Molly.
■ Show your awareness of the other areas of the law of torts which the situation may give 
rise to, such as a claim for damages by Molly under the occupiers’ liability legislation, if 
she suffered any injuries in the crash.
Don’t be tempted to . . . 
■ Just assume that Harry is eligible to bring an action or gloss over this requirement that 
needs to be satisfied.
■ Ignore the potential claims by Tom and just concentrate on what claims Harry can make, 
as the question does not restrict you in that way.
■ Overlook the subsidiary claims Harry could make as, again, while the question is 
predominantly on trespass to land, it does not completely restrict you to that tort.

 ‘This leaves the squeezing out. It is perhaps doubtful whether the cause of action in respect 
of this arises in nuisance or in trespass: see  Esso Petroleum Co. Ltd. v. Southport Corporation

 Answer plan 
 ➜  define trespass to land and explain its function. 
 ➜  Compare and contrast the tort to potential alternatives. 
 ➜  Analyse the nature of the tort and evaluate whether its nature and scope justifies its 
existence. 
 ➜  Conclude by considering whether the tort is distinct and fulfils a needed purpose. 
 Answer 
 The issue to determine is whether the tort of trespass has a suffi-
ciently distinctive purpose to warrant its ongoing retention as a tort. if 
liability for interference with one’s land could arise without basing the 
action in trespass, then it is questionable whether it is needed.  Abol-
ishing the tort though would be significant in light of how it operates. 1 
 1  Keep this brief here. This is 
the introduction so your aim is 
just to identify the underlying 
issues of the question that 
you will address and introduce 
the points you will develop as 
you progress your answer. 
 
 
Highlight what the tort is and explain
its function 
Compare its purpose to other torts
which could be used in the
alternative 
Consider the nature of trepass and
whether it is distinct enough to
justify its application 

187
  Question 2
It will be argued that while other torts have similar functions, it is 
the fact that trespass is actionable per se, meaning without proof of 
actual damage,2 which makes it distinct and justifies its retention as 
this reflects the fundamental importance of a person’s rights in land.
The tort has much broader scope than the layperson’s traditional 
idea of someone wandering onto their land.3 Clerk & Lindsell on 
Torts (Jones et al., 2014) define trespass to land as consisting of 
any unjustifiable intrusion by one person upon land in the possession 
of another. The tort exists to protect a person’s interest in property 
arising through possession, symbolised through an intention to pos-
sess and physical control (JA Pye (Oxford) Ltd v Graham [2002] 
UKHL 22), as opposed to stemming from ownership. What is required 
is to show a direct and immediate, voluntary interference with that 
possession. A proprietary interest, while evidence of possession, is 
not necessary. Therefore, while the purpose of trespass, protecting 
land from interference, is indeed similar to that of the tort of nuisance, 
there is a crucial difference in that nuisance requires a proprietary 
interest in the land (Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd [1997] AC 655) 
that is being interfered with so the choice of action could matter a 
great deal depending on the status of the claimant.4
The quote from the judgment in Home Brewery Co. Ltd suggests, 
though, that substantially trespass serves no distinct purpose and, 
the claimant’s status aside, need not be pleaded in order to suc-
ceed in a claim. This premise may have merit where actual damage 
is caused by the interference, but it also demonstrates the distinc-
tiveness and value of trespass, where there is seemingly no actual 
physical damage, the basis of the action would matter. A lack of 
physical damage would rule out a claim in negligence even if tres-
pass can be committed negligently5 (Network Rail Infrastructure 
Ltd v Cornarken Group Ltd [2010] EWHC 1852). Interference in 
2 This may seem like an 
unnecessary clarification as 
to the definition of per se. 
However, it is quite easy, and 
common, for students to write 
Latin phrases that feature 
often in the textbooks without 
appreciating what they mean. 
By clarifying you demonstrate 
that you understand the 
phrase as opposed to having 
simply remembered reading it.
3 Although you would not 
necessarily have to go into 
detail here as to what is 
protected, this gives an early 
indication that you are aware 
of the scope of the tort.
4 At each stage of your 
answer, and especially 
where you have highlighted 
similarities with other torts, 
try to differentiate trespass to 
show why it can justifiably be 
said to be distinct. This will 
also make sure your answer 
is not purely descriptive.
5 The fact that trespass can be 
caused through a negligent 
incursion on to the land, due 
to it still being voluntary, 
means that if damage occurs, 
as in the case with Network 
Rail, the tort of negligence 
could be relied on instead. 
As such, it is also worth 
contrasting it to trespass 
to assess how distinct the 
latter is. Mentioning this in 
this context also allows you 
to demonstrate quickly the 
difference that does exist 
between the two actions.

188
10  Trespass to land
nuisance,6 while again similar in that actual physical damage is not 
necessary, does differ in that the interference must cause substantial 
damage to the claimant’s interest, reflecting the need for some give 
and take between neighbours (Sedleigh-Denfield v O’Callaghan 
[1940] AC 880).
Therefore, claimants in cases such as Kelsen v Imperial Tobacco 
Co. [1957] 2 QB 334, where a sign marginally hung over the bound-
ary line, would be left without redress in the absence of trespass, as 
the interference was held not sufficient to be an actionable nuisance. 
The damage in nuisance must also be pleaded and proven which 
provides an additional evidential obstacle which does not exist in tres-
pass. Therefore, the purpose of each tort differs and is in fact fulfilled 
in different ways through the need to prove specific elements, which 
means that how the interference occurs may also influence which tort 
the action needs to be brought in.7
As noted, trespass requires interference with the land which must also 
be the result of a direct and voluntary act. If it is indirect, then another 
form of action would be needed, rendering the choice of action impor-
tant. The interference can take many forms though and can relate 
to the land’s surface, subsoil or airspace.8 Examples include simple 
entering of the land, remaining there after one should leave, and 
even just placing a stone against a wall (Gregory v Piper (1829) 
109 ER 220).9 This means that there is an extremely low threshold for 
trespass liability. In Gregory, arguably, no harm was actually done. 
This clearly illustrates the distinctiveness of the tort and its value: no 
actual damage to the land is required. However, there could be said 
to be damage present in that the protection of a person’s interest in 
property is a fundamental right, as seen in Article 1 of the First Proto-
col of the European Convention on Human Rights. Trespass’s role is 
simply to protect the interest in possession of the clamant. The right 
owner should be able to determine who enters the land. If a person 
voluntarily and directly performs an act which directly interferes with 
another’s land, then surely the law is justified in holding that person 
liable, even without actual damage resulting. The mere fact that it 
has been interfered with warrants the imposition of liability. This is 
particularly the case when the interference is intentional. However, 
the problem of the low threshold is exacerbated by the fact that the 
simple act of interference just needs to be voluntary, an intention to 
actually interfere is not relevant. Clearly, some harshness flows from 
6 Although the question does 
not ask specifically for a 
comparison to nuisance, it 
does require you to look at 
whether trespass is sufficiently 
distinct from other torts so a 
comparison is needed to at 
least one. Focusing primarily on 
nuisance has merit as there are 
similarities and, as it is referred 
to in the statement, by using 
it you are clearly relating your 
discussion back to the question.
7 The aim here is to conclude 
the point that you raised at the 
start of the paragraph while 
again providing some context 
to the evaluative discussion 
that you are having by relating 
it back to the proposition in 
the question. Nuisance in its 
current form could not perform 
the same role as trespass. 
You can then also build on the 
point made by flowing straight 
into the requirements that 
trespass’s purpose requires.
8 What you are going to do 
in this section is analyse the 
nature of trespass and justify 
its existence in theoretical 
terms and principle rather 
than just because it is different 
to other torts. By doing so, 
you are not just describing 
the requirements, but also 
providing a critique of them.
9 Such examples are arguably 
not needed as you have 
explained what is required. 
However, using examples show 
that you more fully understand 
the requirement and the 
broader range of situations that 
it applies to which leads into the 
point you are about to make.

189
  Question 2
this, e.g. in Conway v George Wimpey & Co. Ltd [1951] 2 KB 
26610 liability resulted where the entry followed a completely innocent 
mistake because the entry onto the land was still intended, but the 
interference could still be said to be direct.
Therefore, it is clear from the requirements of trespass that its opera-
tion and, therefore, applicability to a given situation is unique. It has a 
distinct scope compared to other torts which allows it to fill a void in 
the level of protection afforded by tort which would otherwise exist if 
the issue was left to actions dealing with indirect interferences such 
as nuisance or indeed negligence.11 Further, only one act is required 
for a claim to arise and, therefore, other torts such as harassment, 
based on a course of conduct, offer no relief in such a situation.
To conclude, while there are similarities with other torts, the under-
lying function of trespass to land shows that it is ultimately aimed at 
providing a different form of redress to torts such as nuisance and 
negligence. The purpose and operation of the protection is unique and 
other torts can only satisfactorily replace trespass in circumstances 
where there is something more akin to actual damage, and so what 
they are in effect protecting is something different. Therefore, a dis-
tinct tort embodied by trespass to land is needed to protect rights in 
land when the injury is to the right of possession of the land itself. A 
simple voluntary act leading to the direct interference with that inter-
est is sufficient damage even if the land is not physically affected. If 
this is not recognised, then all forms of trespass to the person would 
also need abolishing. However, it is perhaps arguable that in light of 
the more abstract nature of the damage required, the interference 
should be intentional to warrant liability being imposed. That would 
also further reinforce the distinctiveness of trespass to land and bring 
it in line with trespass to the person.12
10 As the example you are 
going on to explain here is 
a different issue from that 
which you highlighted earlier 
in the paragraph, it is fine to 
draw on another case as you 
are not simply listing cases on 
the same point.

lines is important in order

the question and reinforce 
the impression that you are

question.

sentence is to indicate 
that you are aware how 
this tort sits with the other 
forms of trespass and that

How this topic may come up in exams
Nuisance problem questions require several different factors to be considered to 
determine whether a claim has been made out. You will also have to determine 
whether the nuisance is private or public and whether the nuisance is covered 
by statute such as environmental protection legislation. In addition, there is the 
possibility of a question having the potential to explore issues of negligence and the 
rule in Rylands v Fletcher as well. There is also a significant human rights impact in 
this tort, particularly Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and the 
implications this has for Hunter v Canary Wharf and the necessity for a proprietary 
interest to bring an action, which can form the basis of essay questions.

  Question 1
  Question 1
Declan purchased a large country estate called McDonnell House last year. The estate  
consists of a large detached mansion at its centre, surrounded by idyllic grounds, including 
a golf course. In order to diversify his revenue streams Declan also decided to use part of 
the grounds to host weddings. McDonnell House neighbours land adjacent to that owned by 
Anthony. Anthony is a British civil war enthusiast who uses his farmland to re-enact the Wars 
of the Roses for the public to attend. The events are also combined with lectures on the wars 
to inform people about their history. The re-enactments are staged on Thursday to Sunday 
and last for eight hours each day. These events have always been extremely popular, espe-
cially with schools from across the country. Anthony has won several tourist and educational 
awards for the events and has significantly increased the number of employees he has as  
a result.
However, the staging of the re-enactments clash with the main days for golf players and 
weddings on Declan’s land. The noise from the battles soon started to cause problems for 
Declan and many customers complained that they could not concentrate on their golf play. 
Declan also had to give full refunds to two wedding parties who claimed that their weddings 
were ruined by the interference from the re-enactments, and several weddings have been 
cancelled. Declan has now reached the stage where he feels that his own personal  
enjoyment of the estate is being diminished and so he has reluctantly moved out to live in 
another property that he owns. As such, he has sought to put an end to Anthony’s use of his 
land. Declan was aware of the re-enactments when he first purchased McDonell House.
Advise Anthony:
(a)	 whether he could successfully contest an action by Declan in nuisance; and
(b)	 whether, if not, he could at least stop an injunction being granted.

by Anthony.1 Resolving this is important as it could potentially result

  Question 1
in Anthony being prevented from carrying on his activities.2 It will be 
argued that the requirements of the tort may be satisfied, but that 
due to the social utility of Anthony’s use of his land, he may be able 
to resist Declan obtaining an injunction.
As Declan owns McDonnell House he will have a sufficient enough 
proprietary interest to enable him to have standing to bring an action 
against Anthony3 (Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd [1997] AC 655). 
There is clearly an interference with Declan’s land, but to be actiona-
ble Declan will need to show that the noise amounts to a substantial 
interference with the use and enjoyment of his land. The tort strikes 
a balance between the competing interests of one person’s interest in 
using their land as they wish with that of another’s interest to be free 
from interference,4 and the matter is determined on a case-by-case  
basis depending on the individual facts (Sturgess v Bridgman 
(1879) 11 Ch D 852).5
As the interference claimed by Declan does not appear to result from 
any particular sensitivity of his land, the focus will be on the nature of 
the locality of the area.6 Consideration of the locality is also important 
as we are just dealing with personal discomfort rather than material 
damage. Furthering the idea that there should be some give and take 
between neighbours in such a situation, the law looks at the locality of 
the land in order to determine whether the interference is substantial. 
Therefore, what could constitute a nuisance in one type of area may 
not be in another (Sturgess). As this is the countryside, it is natu-
rally quieter than an urban setting and so the increased noise of the 
re-enactments would be more noticeable; yet the countryside is also 
the natural location for Anthony’s activity. However, Anthony should 
be advised that conducting an activity in an appropriate location does 
not prevent it being a nuisance.7 The fact that the noise appears to 
travel some distance and affect the house in the centre of the estate 
would suggest it is significantly loud.
Before this amounts to a nuisance though the substantial interfer-
ence must also be unreasonable. Anthony should be advised that 
this involves assessing the seriousness of his interference and then 
whether his use of his land is reasonable. In determining the serious-
ness of the interference, its duration and extent must be considered. 
While we do not know the exact level of the noise, we do know that it 
goes on for eight hours a day, four days a week. We also know that 
2 As you are advising Declan, 
explain to him what the tort 
consists of. Again, this will 
also give an early indication 
to your marker that you know 
how the tort works.
3 While this may seem 
obvious, this requirement has 
been strictly applied and so 
for completeness you should 
briefly state it.
4 Briefly show that you 
understand what process 
the law is going through with 
this aspect of the tort as this 
conflict lies at the heart of the 
tort, before going into your 
application. This will allow 
you to demonstrate that you 
appreciate what the tort is 
about rather than just what its 
requirements are.
5 By adding this you also show 
how the tension behind the tort 
impacts on the application of 
the requirements for the tort.
6 By phrasing in this way you 
can show that you know both 
factors but, more importantly, 
that you understand their 
application by not going into 
detail on sensitivity as it does 
not seem on the facts that 
it is an issue. You can then 
use the time saved to explain 
the additional importance of 
locality to the type of injury 
allegedly suffered.
7 It is still worth considering 
this fact though in order to 
give some balance to your 
discussion and further the 
level of evaluation that your 
answer contains.

198
11  Nuisance
the noise is so great that two weddings have had to be refunded and 
others have been cancelled in light of the noise. Further, Declan has 
moved out of the mansion in the centre of the property.8 This would 
suggest that not only are the noise levels substantial, but also serious.
On the basis that there is sufficient seriousness,9 the next issue 
to determine is whether Anthony is a reasonable user of his land. 
Although liability in nuisance centres on the interference with the 
claimant’s interest in the land being unreasonable there is, as Lord 
Goff noted in Cambridge Water Co. Ltd v Eastern Counties 
Leather plc [1994] 2 AC 264,10 an inter-relationship with whether 
the defendant’s conduct is reasonable. Again, there are several fac-
tors to consider for determining this. It does not appear that Anthony 
is acting maliciously and it seems unlikely that the interference could 
be easily prevented, both of which would lend support to the interfer-
ence not being unreasonable. However, this must be weighed against 
the fact that while liability for nuisance is strict, and thus not based 
on the need to take reasonable care not to cause the interference, 
liability may still arise where the harm caused is reasonably foresee-
able liability (Cambridge Water ). The harm here is interference with 
Declan’s use and enjoyment of his land from the noise of the battles 
and although this may depend upon some unknown factors it was 
arguably foreseeable as the lands are adjacent.
Another factor in relation to the reasonableness of Anthony’s use of 
his land is the fact that it seems to generate a lot of public benefit.11 
On the basis that the re-enactments are not illegal12 there is noth-
ing unreasonable per se about his use. In fact, his use of his land 
may actually be deemed reasonable due to its social utility, in that it 
acts as a learning environment by educating people about the wars, 
generates employment and is a popular family attraction. However, 
benefiting the public cannot provide an immunity13 and the courts are 
reluctant to let private rights, such as those enjoyed by Declan, be 
extinguished in favour of the general public without some form of stat-
utory authority. Therefore, Anthony should be advised that the court 
may still find this an actionable nuisance, but the social utility of his 
actions could be taken into account when dealing with what remedy 
8 While there are no precise 
facts given you cannot avoid a 
discussion. At the same time 
you must not assume facts 
or make them up. Draw on 
what you can to advance an 
argument on the issue, but 
make sure you write it in a 
way that reflects the inherent 
vagueness of the question.
9 Following from the previous 
point, it is important that you 
introduce the next issue in 
this way to continue with the 
caveat to your advice that you 
have highlighted and maintain 
a consistent approach.
10 The actual quote by Lord 
Goff is not necessarily 
needed, instead you just need 
to refer to the case as the 
authority for the point that you 
are advancing.
11 As this appears to be the 
main factor and therefore 
your main area of discussion, 
make sure that you separate 
it out so that your argument 
stands out.
12 You do not know for sure 
and it may be that they are, 
so you should place this 
qualification to your statement 
for completeness.
13 As this is not a defence, 
but something which is 
considered more as part of 
the reasonableness of the 
defendant’s use, deal with this 
before the actual defences.

199
  Question 1
to award if Anthony is not found to have any defence14 (Dennis v 
Ministry of Defence [2003] Env LR 34).
As Declan has not had his proprietary interest interfered with for 20 
years, Anthony could not claim a defence of prescription.15 A more 
obvious factor for Anthony to seek to rely on is the fact that Declan 
purchased his land knowing of Anthony’s activities, and, therefore, 
he came to the nuisance. However, this has consistently been held to 
not be a defence since Bliss v Hall (1838) 4 Bing NC183. Therefore, 
Anthony does face being liable.
In terms of possible remedy, following Coventry v Lawrence [2014] 
UKSC 14, this issue should be approached with more flexibility and 
not slavishly follow the previous criteria from Shelfer v City of 
London Electric Lighting Co. [1895] 1 Ch. 287. Lord Neuberger 
expressly mentioned the prospect of the defendant’s business closing, 
and the resultant consequences if an injunction is granted should be 
considered. The decision means damages in lieu of an injunction may 
be more freely awarded. This should assist Anthony by allowing him 
to compensate Declan for the difference in monetary value between 
what his interest was worth before and after the nuisance (Moss v 
Christchurch RDC [1925] 2 KB750). This would still allow Anthony 
to pursue his activities.
In conclusion, Anthony’s use of his land is likely to be considered 
a substantial and unreasonable interference with Declan’s use and 
enjoyment of his land. However, while Declan may seek an injunction, 
in light of the potential social utility of the use to which Anthony is 
using his land, an award of damages is more likely.
14 It may seem natural to flow 
straight into the discussion 
of Coventry and what remedy 
may be obtained, especially 
as you will have spotted that 
there is no valid defence on 
the facts. However, you do 
need to advise Anthony of 
the fact that he will have no 
defence and in doing so show 
the marker that you do know 
and understand that aspect 
of the tort. Therefore, briefly 
move into defences from this 
point as it will not make sense 
logically or structurally to deal 
with defences either before 
this paragraph or at the end.
15 As mentioned earlier in 
relation to sensitivity, by 
referring to prescription 
in this manner you show 
that you know that there 
is such a defence but that 
you understand that it is not 
applicable.

Act 1998.

Answer
The tort of nuisance protects one’s interest in land; however, this 
function means that its scope is limited to those who own the land 
(Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd [1997] AC 655). The issue that this 
causes is that residents of a property have no redress, even though 
they would be suffering the same interference as the owner. The 
issue is heightened since the passing of the Human Rights Act 1998 
as the law’s compatibility with human rights can be questioned. It will 
be argued that, while the reasoning in Hunter is justified, it is not 
sustainable on human rights grounds and those who reside in the 
property affected by the alleged nuisance activity should have redress 
under the tort, or through a new analogous tort.1

11  Nuisance
In protecting interests in land from reoccurring substantial and unrea-
sonable interferences, nuisance can take two forms2 (St Helen’s 
Smelting Co. v Tipping (1865) HL Cas 642). First, nuisance can 
amount to material damage to the land with such claims being rela-
tively straightforward; the land itself is damaged and thus it is logical 
that the claim should be brought by the owner of the damaged land. 
The second form is nuisance producing sensible personal discom-
fort, or amenity interference. The act interferes with the enjoyment 
of the land, for example producing noise and smells. Therefore, the 
enjoyment of all those present on the land is affected and not just the 
owner of the land who actually may not be present.
This issue as to who can rely on the tort came to the fore in Hunter 
where a group of residents claimed nuisance arising from local con-
struction work. Significantly, not all of the residents had a proprietary 
interest in their respective homes. Their claim initially failed for want 
of a proprietary interest, but succeeded on appeal with Pill LJ holding 
that, where an individual occupied the land as their home, they would 
have a sufficient link to the land to enable them to make the claim.3
This decision was itself appealed and reversed by a majority of the 
House of Lords who took a traditional view of the tort. Lord Goff 
observed that parties may seek to negotiate an agreement over the 
interfering activity. However, if an agreement was needed with every-
one who lived in the property the ease of reaching an agreement and 
its effectiveness would be reduced. This is a strong point; however, 
the potential ability to impose implied authorisation on the homeowner 
to represent non-owning residents means it is not insurmountable,4 
as Lord Cooke highlighted in his dissent.5 Lord Goff also raised con-
cerns with how to define ‘substantial link’. While Pill LJ intended his 
phrase to cover the owner’s immediate family, Lord Goff questioned 
whether it should include lodgers and au pairs who also live there. His 
Lordship then questioned why it would not then extend to cover the 
workplace. To avoid permitting any individual, even a regular visitor, 
to bring an action, and thus take the tort away from its historical 
purpose of protecting interests in land, a reference point for deter-
mining standing to bring a claim is needed.6 However, this was again 
countered by Lord Cooke, who argued it was ‘weak’ to not lay down 
a rule which was justifiable in relation to spouses and children just 
because of a grey area as to where the line is ultimately drawn. While 
the issue may be one of creating legal certainty as well as giving

specifically call for a 
discussion of the test for 
nuisance and how a claim 
would succeed; however, if 
you introduce the forms of 
nuisance in this way you can 
demonstrate that you know 
the test without losing focus.
3 Obviously, this reasoning 
was rejected by the majority 
of the House of Lords, but 
it is worth stating as a point 
of reference for your answer 
later on.
4 Although here you are 
advancing the reasons of 
the majority and why the 
case was ultimately decided 
the way it was, you need 
to subject this reasoning to 
analysis, and so try to assess 
the merit of each point you 
state. You need to look at the 
flaws directly related to this 
reasoning before you can get 
on to advancing the specific 
arguments for the alternate 
view. If you wait until later, 
your structure will not be as 
strong.

so that the contradictory 
views make sense.

  Question 2
justice to the claimants, this opinion has force in that it could, as Lord 
Goff observed, be limited quite easily to the immediate family of the 
homeowner. Other residents could be dealt with on the facts of their 
case. Lord Cooke further observed that, as employees are the concern 
of their employers, there was no policy basis for allowing the law to 
extend to non-resident employees.
While agreeing with the outcome, Lord Hoffmann focused on more 
theoretical matters,7 basing his opinion on the purpose of the tort 
being to protect land. He argued it was vital to appreciate that in 
Tipping, while the two forms of nuisance were mentioned, they still 
amounted to one tort concerned with protecting land from injury. As 
such, amenity interference is based not on the personal discomfort 
of an individual, but rather that the utility of the land is diminished 
and, therefore, the land has suffered injury. The tort exists to protect 
land from injury, and as such it must be the landowner who sues for 
its injury. Lord Hoffmann felt that to develop the common law in the 
manner suggested by Pill LJ would result in the fundamental princi-
ples of the tort being distorted.8
Lord Hoffmann’s reasoning is harder to counter and makes the deci-
sion in Hunter justifiable in light of the tort’s purpose. As Lord Hoff-
mann notes, the land’s utility is reflected in the amenity value of the 
land, and so it is the owner who suffers the damage. However, the 
consequence is that a non-owning occupier who has their enjoyment 
of the land diminished is left without redress as the decision denies 
the existence of any enjoyment of such amenity by anyone bar the 
owner.
The subsequent coming into force of the Human Rights Act 19989 
does question the long-term viability of the principle from Hunter 
as the Act incorporates the Article 8 right to respect for privacy and 
family life. The significance of this is that the Article includes refer-
ence to the ‘home’ and in Khatun v UK 26 EHRR CD 212 this was 
held to be ‘autonomous’ and did not require defining domestically. 
As such, the case arising from the same facts as Hunter stated 
that a proprietary interest was not needed to claim under Article 8. 
Therefore, anyone whose home is subjected to an actionable nui-
sance would have a claim. The law must give effect to Article 8 as it 
develops (Douglas v Hello Ltd [2001] 2 WLR 992), and its influence 
was seen in McKenna v British Aluminium Ltd [2002] Env LR 30 
7 A distinction in the approach 
of Lords Goff and Hoffmann 
can be made so highlight 
this to show your broader 
understanding of the case 
and to explain why you are 
setting out the views of 
another judge who was in the 
majority.
8 This is why it is really 
important that you know the 
purpose of the tort and can 
explain it, as this was used to 
justify the majority’s decision. 
If you do not know the theory 
behind the tort, then you are 
less able to fully assess the 
implications and merit of that 
decision. The tort’s purpose is 
the bar from which you judge 
the arguments.
9 As Hunter was decided 
before the incorporation of 
the Act, it is important that 
you then move on to consider, 
regardless of the merits of 
Lord Cooke’s opinion, whether 
this now acts as a driver 
for reforming the position 
adopted by the majority.

where a striking-out application10 was rejected on the basis that the 
claimants, who could not sue in nuisance due to Hunter, were said 
to still have an actionable case based on Article 8. Neuberger J, while 
not offering any further view of the need for a proprietary interest, was 
mindful that the claim included a tort analogous to nuisance. Creating 
an analogous action alongside the traditional tort and claims under 
Article 8 would make the law overly complicated.
It is submitted, in conclusion, that Hunter will need to be revisited 
as there is now a clear divergence with human rights jurisprudence. 
However, if it is deemed too difficult to overcome Lord Hoffmann’s 
objections, an analogous tort based on the interference with the 
home, actionable by all residents, would need to be developed to give 
effect to Article 8 and give redress to non-owning occupiers whose 
enjoyment of the land is diminished. The better option may be to 
depart from the traditional view of the tort’s purpose and operation.11

  Question 3
  Question 3
Gidsville is an estate which is predominantly residential in nature although there are some 
businesses. However, to regenerate an area on the edge of the estate, the council recently 
gave planning permission to Prento Petroleum to build a factory there. The company is a 
large manufacturer of parts for the oil industry. Having recently won another large contract, 
Prento Petroleum has had to extend the working day to include shifts up to midnight rather 
than have the staff work weekends. As a result, the company has employed large numbers 
of local residents, but the work has generated a large amount of smoke and particularly 
noise which can be heard over the estate. One of the businesses on the estate, Di Rossi’s, an 
Italian restaurant, has witnessed a drop in trade.
Additionally, Spencer, who works the late shift at the factory, bought a flat opposite Di 
Rossi’s three years ago. However, since he started working the late shift six months ago he 
has had problems himself with Di Rossi’s deliveries arriving at 10 a.m. and waking him up. 
When he complained, the owner of Di Rossi’s, Morgan, pointed out that the deliveries have 
been turning up at that time for over 20 years and no one has ever complained.
Advise Morgan about any claim he may have for the loss in trade, and also regarding 
Spencer’s complaints.

Answer plan
➜ Identify whether the estate constitutes a sufficient class of people affected by the activities 
of Prento Petroleum.
➜ Establish whether Morgan has suffered special damage so as to make an action applicable.
➜ Discuss whether Prento Petroleum can rely on the council’s planning permission to defeat 
any action.
➜ Advise Morgan of the claim he faces by Spencer.
➜ Evaluate whether the interference is substantial.
➜ Consider whether the use of the land by Morgan is reasonable.
➜ Advise as to the merits of a defence, if required, based on prescription.
Answer
Morgan requires advice as to the tort of nuisance, owing to the threat 
to his business from Prento Petroleum and also claims he may face 
from Spencer. It will be argued that Morgan is likely to be successful in 
an action for public nuisance against the factory, while his actions are 
unlikely to be sufficient for any private nuisance claim against him.1
1 Demonstrate at the start 
that you understand that 
both forms of nuisance are 
applicable to the question and 
which type relates to each 
claim.
Have the activities of Prento Petroleum
aﬀected a suﬃcient class of people?
Morgan’s action
The claim against Morgan
If so, is the Ioss of trade suﬃcient to be
classiﬁed as special damage?
Does the council’s issuing of planning
permission alter the character of the estate
so as to defeat the action?
In view of the locality, would this be a
substantial interference with Spencer’s
enjoyment of the land?
Does the extent. character and duration of
the interference make it unreasonable?
If there is an actionable nuisance, could
Di Rossi’s claim an easement by prescription
to defeat the claim?

207
  Question 3
Public nuisance requires an act which ‘materially affects the rea-
sonable comfort and convenience of life of a class of Her Majesty’s 
subjects’ (per Romer LJ in Attorney General v PYA Quarries Ltd 
[1957] 2 QB 169). Prento Petroleum creating smoke and noise until 
midnight would affect the comfort and convenience of the residents. 
However, the area affected must be large enough to constitute a suf-
ficient class. While we are not told the estate’s population, the fact 
that the smoke and noise cover the entire estate suggests that this 
community would be a sufficient class.
Although public nuisance affects a class of people, an individual can 
bring an action. However, Morgan must show he suffered ‘special 
damage’, which is greater than that suffered by others within the 
class. The damage suffered which would be greater than that affect-
ing the rest of the estate is the loss of custom. Morgan should be 
advised that while negligence looks less favourably on pure economic 
losses2 such as this, a loss of business is sufficient for nuisance 
(Benjamin v Storr (1874) LR 9 CP 400). This particular loss must 
also be direct and substantial. By analogy with Benjamin, the facts 
here suggest that Morgan satisfies the requirements for an action.
However, if any of the other businesses have suffered a loss in trade, 
Morgan’s claim would fail as he has suffered no greater loss than 
others within the class.3
The loss suffered is also foreseeable and so no issue of remote-
ness exists. Therefore, on the basis that Morgan has suffered special 
damage,4 Prento Petroleum will argue that the granting of planning 
permission authorised any resultant nuisance. While statutory author-
ity provides immunity against nuisance, the position is different with 
regard to mere planning permission (Wheeler v J.J. Saunders Ltd 
[1996] Ch 19). Wheeler held that planning authorities have no gen-
eral power to authorise a nuisance, although they possibly could to the 
extent that they may alter the character of a neighbourhood through 
their decisions. Therefore, the question is whether, by granting per-
mission for the factory, the council has altered the estate’s character. 
Regeneration was a factor behind the decision, so this may be the 
case; however, we are told that this was just for an area on the edge 
of the estate, not the whole estate. As Gidsville is predominantly a 
residential area,5 it is unlikely that the planning permission has suffi-
ciently altered the overall area’s character and so the defence will fail.
2 This may not appear totally 
relevant but it is an anomaly 
with the law which has 
attracted judicial criticism, 
and so by mentioning it 
briefly, and in the context 
shown, you maintain 
relevance while also showing 
your knowledge of this point

to Morgan and the facts are 
silent, you must ensure that 
you explain the situation if 
this was the unknown factual 
situation.

previous paragraph with an 
element of doubt as to the 
claim, you should start the next 
part of your discussion in this 
manner so that it follows on 
from the previous paragraph.

the facts of the question to 
support your argument on 
this point, as they give a good 
indication as to what the 
position will be.

11  Nuisance
If Morgan is successful, it is unlikely that an injunction6 would be 
awarded to prevent the company’s actions completely as this would 
create unemployment. However, in view of the noise affecting the 
entire estate, one may be granted to restrict the working times so 
that work stops earlier. In any event, Morgan would be able to claim 
damages for his lost trade.
In relation now to the claim against Morgan, the nuisance being 
claimed is interference with Spencer’s use and enjoyment of his 
land caused by the delivery trucks.7 The merits of this claim will be 
weighed, on the facts, against Morgan’s right to use his land in a way 
that he wishes (Sturgess v Bridgman (1879) 11 Ch D 852).8 As this 
only affects Spencer, the action would be for private nuisance and so 
it must be confirmed that, as the owner of the flat, Spencer would 
have the necessary standing to bring a claim (Hunter v Canary 
Wharf Ltd [1997] AC 655).
The interference must be substantial in nature. Spencer is not using 
his land in a particularly sensitive way and so the factor to consider 
is that of locality. While the whole estate is predominantly residential, 
we would need to know about this particular part of the estate, as 
what may be a nuisance in one part may not be in another. Noise from 
delivery vans in a general residential area would probably be substan-
tial; however, a restaurant is unlikely to exist on a general residential 
road. Further, the fact that Spencer’s property is a flat suggests that 
this could also be above one of the other shops. If so, then noise from 
the vans is unlikely to be substantial.
On the basis that this is deemed to be a substantial interference,9 
the next issue is whether the substantial interference is unreason-
able. There are several factors on which to advise Morgan, but of 
most relevance are the duration of the interference, its extent and 
its character. The character of the interference is obviously noise, 
although it appears it is only an issue because it wakes Spencer 
up, which suggests that the interference is not an issue otherwise. 
From the facts, we are told the vans arrive at 10 a.m., although we 
are not told whether this is daily or how long they stay. Arguably, this 
is a reasonable time to deliver when most people would already be 
awake. Further, as delivery vans usually have several stops the noise

injunction, as this is more 
likely to be the most desired 
as well as the least likely 
to succeed. Therefore, you 
can finish on the stronger 
consolation point that he 
would at least receive 
damages.

answer by identifying exactly 
the issue that Morgan is faced 
with.

tort operates.
9 Even if you have concluded 
the previous discussion with a 
view that it is not substantial, 
the absence of concrete facts 
means it could be. However, 
to maintain consistency in 
your answer, you will need to 
phrase the introduction of the 
next point of discussion in a 
more tentative manner.

  Question 3
is unlikely to go on for long.10 The suggestion that Morgan is a rea-
sonable user is supported by the fact that no one else has complained 
over a long period and even Spencer has not complained until now. 
Therefore, even if the noise is deemed substantial, it is unlikely to 
be unreasonable unless perhaps the noise is excessively loud and 
goes on for an excessive period. If overall the nuisance is deemed 
negligible, it will not be actionable against Morgan.
However, Morgan should be advised that, if the noise is deemed 
actionable, any claim will probably succeed as he does not appear to 
have a defence. The only possibility is an easement by prescription. 
This means that a proprietary interest has been created by long usage 
(over 20 years). This would be unsuccessful because it is unlikely that 
noise from delivery vans would constitute an easement, as there is no 
benefit to the land.11 Additionally, while the noise has been going on 
for over 20 years, there was no actionable nuisance during that time 
as there was no interference with Spencer’s land. There would need 
to be a 20-year period from the time the interference began (Stur-
gess v Bridgman). The interference has only started since Spencer 
started working the shifts six months ago.
In conclusion, Morgan should be advised that he should be able to 
recuperate his losses caused by Prento Petroleum; in relation to Spen-
cer, it is unlikely that the interference from the vans will be sufficient 
to warrant a successful action.
10 Use your common sense to 
make an informed argument 
in order to overcome the 
absence of concrete facts. It 
is important that you do not 
just ignore the issue.
11 While being an issue of land 
law, it is a significant point 
in relation to the defence 
against the tort succeeding,

The rule in  
Rylands v Fletcher
How this topic may come up in exams
While it is a long-standing tort in its own right providing strict liability, the rule is now 
seen as a sub-species of nuisance dealing with incidents of a one-off escape. As 
such, while a problem question could consist solely of the tort on its own, you should 
be aware of the possibility of a nuisance action being present as well, particularly if 
there is some form of material damage to the land. The development of the tort also 
means that you could have scope to discuss issues of negligence. Therefore, make 
sure you are also able to deal with an essay question concerning the future of the 
tort and its relevance today.

  Question 1
  Question 1
Hydrotricity Ltd is a provider of renewable energy using hydropower. To help meet the con-
sumer demand for green energy, the company sought permission to build two artificial dams 
on the outskirts of Chemersham as part of a large pumped-storage power generation plant. 
Permission was given for the proposal under the provisions of the (fictitious) Green Energy 
Act 2013. This was despite some environmental objections by certain groups on the grounds 
that it would harm local wildlife, especially migratory fish and the surrounding countryside. 
The construction of the facility generated significant high-skilled jobs for the area and pro-
vided a much needed boost to the local economy. As part of the efforts to win approval for 
the plan, the local residents of Chemersham would receive discounted energy prices.
However, despite its successful construction, protests about the plant have continued. As 
part of these protests, Owen, a well-known opponent of the plant, devised a plan to discredit 
the safety of the plant by engineering a leak from one of the dams. Owen believed that he 
could control the direction of the resulting flooding, and limit its extent, so as not to cause 
damage to neighbouring properties. Following several attempts, Owen successfully entered 
the plant as a maintenance entrance had not been properly secured, and he managed to 
cause a leak. However, he did so as water was being released back to the lower dam so it 
escaped with far more force than he anticipated, and more water subsequently escaped.
As a result, Eric, who runs a farm on the neighbouring property, suffered severe flooding to 
his fields and the loss of the whole of that season’s crops.
Advise the company on their chances of successfully defending a claim for the damage 
suffered by Eric.

➜ Evaluate the foreseeability of the harm which would be caused by such an escape.

Answer
The circumstances surrounding the damage suffered by Eric require 
advising him on the rule in Rylands v Fletcher (1866) LR 1 Ex 265. 
This tort, while similar to other land torts, offers protection for inter-
ests in property which are injured by a one-off occurrence.1 As such, 
Eric will be advised as to the elements of the rule and whether the 
actions of Owen and the statutory permission mean that Hydrotricity 
has a valid defence.2
Hydrotricity should be advised that the applicable tort covers a situa-
tion where someone brings something on to their land in furtherance 
of a non-natural use of their land, which if it escaped would be liable 
to cause harm. If the ‘thing’ does escape, then the person is liable for 
all of the damage which is a consequence of the escape, regardless 
of their fault in the ‘thing’ escaping.3 To bring a claim, Eric must have 
a proprietary interest in the land affected by the escape of the waste 
and his property must have been damaged (Transco plc v Stock-
port MBC [2004] 2 AC 1). We are not expressly told this, but it is 
likely that this is satisfied based on the information we have.4 On that 
basis, he would have standing to make a claim.
The first element to consider is whether Hydrotricity has brought 
something on to their land which amounts to a non-natural use of the 
land. Underpinning the rule is the idea that if the person has volun-
tarily brought a ‘thing’ on to their land and kept it there at their peril 
– here, the water – liability will arise where the ‘thing’ is not naturally 
there or its use is unordinary. Originally, this was held to mean a spe-
cial use which brought increased danger and not some use which is 
proper for the general benefit of the community (Rickards v Lothian 
[1913] AC 263). Therefore, Rickards is significant as Hydrotricity’s 
use of the land for power generation has brought a significant upturn 
to the local economy and financial benefits to local consumers. This

3 Before you start to apply the 
different requirements to the 
problem, it is worth outlining 
what the rule consists of. 
However, paraphrase the 
rule as stated by Blackburn 
J to emphasise that you 
understand the individual 
parts.
4 So as to not make it look 
like you are assuming facts, 
you either need to spell out 
exactly why you believe this to 
be the case (he runs the farm 
and his crops were damaged) 
or use a phrase like this to 
illustrate you are relying on 
the facts.

215
  Question 1
could be said, therefore, to benefit the community notwithstanding 
what has happened to Eric’s farm.5 However, doubt was cast on the 
latter part of the Rickards interpretation in Cambridge Water Co. 
Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc [1994] 2 AC 264 where the 
creation of employment, in itself, was held not sufficient. This was 
affirmed in Transco where Lord Bingham6 said the focus should be 
on the increased danger to others from the use, with the question 
being simply whether the use is extraordinary in light of the time and 
place that it is done. Ordinary uses, bringing little risk, will be outside 
the rule. There may be scope to argue that this was an ordinary use 
in the circumstances, but storing large quantities of water, such as 
this, does bring increased danger to the neighbouring land if there 
were an escape. Ultimately, the number of cases which have held 
that storing water in large quantities on land is an extraordinary/non- 
natural use, including Rylands itself, means that this requirement 
will be satisfied by Eric.
The next aspect of the rule is that of escape.7 For a claim to succeed, 
the ‘thing’ must cross Hydrotricity’s boundary and enter land which 
is not within their control (Read v Lyons [1947] AC 156). This is 
clearly seen here as we are told that the water leaked out and flooded 
Eric’s farm.
However, the harm caused by the escape must have been a type 
which was foreseeable. As the rule requires the person to keep the 
thing at their peril in case it escapes, then, in view of liability being 
strict, it is just to require that it is foreseeable that damage will be 
caused.8 Hydrotricity should be advised that in Cambridge Water 
it was stressed that the tort is not based on negligence and, there-
fore, even if the company demonstrates that it took all reasonable 
precautions to prevent the escape, this would not affect the issue 
of foreseeability of damage if the escape did happen. As the farm is 
next to the plant, it must have been foreseeable that the farm would 
suffer flooding if there was an escape of the accumulated water and, 
therefore, the harm which has occurred – damage to the field and 
the destruction of the crops – must also be foreseeable. Therefore it 
appears that, provided the use of the land is deemed an unusual use, 
the tort has been made out.9
Hydrotricity should be advised that, while liability under the rule is 
strict, there are various defences to a claim. As the construction and 
5 Although part of this has 
now been doubted, and 
so will not be applicable, 
including it in this way allows 
you to get across some 
analytical and evaluative 
comment in your answer, and 
illustrate your knowledge of 
the debate.
6 Be specific here as, for 
example, Lord Hoffmann did 
not think that ordinary use 
was any better than non-
natural use. You therefore 
show more in-depth 
knowledge.
7 While it may seem as though 
this has obviously been 
satisfied, it still needs to be 
shown, albeit briefly.
8 Explaining the rationale for 
this element allows you to 
build up the level of evaluation 
in your answer, especially as 
it has been seen as being a 
relatively new requirement.
9 At the end of applying the 
elements, you should give a 
mini-conclusion as to whether 
the tort is likely to be made 
out in order to explain why 
there is a need to discuss 
defences.

216
12  The rule in Rylands v Fletcher
operation of the plant was authorised by statute, they would seem-
ingly be able to rely on the defence of statutory authority. However, 
the defence is only applicable if they were acting under a duty to 
accumulate the water on their land, and not simply where they have 
permission to accumulate the water (Smeaton v Ilford Corporation 
[1954] Ch 45). Therefore, this will not aid them.10
The defence which Hydrotricity may have more success with11 is that 
the escape was due to an act of a third party, whom they had no 
control over (Box v Jubb (1879) 4 Ex D 76). To defeat the claim on 
the basis that Hydrotricity is not at fault for the escape may seem at 
odds with the overall purpose of the tort, but there is some justification 
where it is a completely independent act of a stranger. This appears 
to be the case here as Owen is completely independent of Hydro-
tricity and intentionally caused the leak, and thus the flood, and so 
there should be no liability (Rickards). However, Hydrotricity should 
be advised that the defence, in fact, only applies if the third-party act 
could not have reasonably been contemplated and guarded against 
(Perry v Kendricks Transport Ltd [1956] 1 WLR 85). Owen was 
a ‘well-known’ protestor and had made several efforts to gain entry 
to the plant,12 which suggests that the incident should have been in 
Hydrotricity’s mind and efforts should have been made to prevent 
him gaining entry. Yet what happened was that a door was not prop-
erly secured which allowed him access. This suggests negligence on 
their part and so the defence would be defeated. Hydrotricity should 
be advised that, in view of the comments in Cambridge Water 
about the irrelevance to liability of taking reasonable care, and that 
in Transco negligence was again held not to play a part, even if 
they had not been negligent, they would still probably face liability 
notwithstanding Perry. 13
In conclusion, Hydrotricity face liability as the facts suggest that this 
is a non-ordinary use of such land, regardless of what benefits it has 
brought, and therefore the rule will apply to their activities, which they 
were not obliged to do. While the escape was caused by Owen, his 
act was arguably something which Hydrotricity had control over and 
so any defence on that basis will probably fail.
10 Even if you have determined 
straightaway that the defence 
will not help, it is worth 
including it as the facts raise 
it. Sometimes a defence may 
be applicable for discussion 
even if it will not be 
successful. The key is to keep 
it brief and ensure that you 
include a line demonstrating 
you know why it does 
not apply, and therefore, 
understand its operation.
11 Ultimately this defence will 
also be likely to fail so you 
could discuss the defences 
in either order. However, 
where one has more chance 
of success it is better to end 
with that as if it does succeed, 
there is no need to consider 
the others. In this case, it is 
probably better to deal with 
this second as there is at least 
more of a debate to be had.
12 These facts are important in 
determining whether there is 
any chance that Eric’s claim 
may still succeed and so you 
need to use them to illustrate 
why, when it appears the 
defence is valid, he may still 
have a chance of success.
13 Before you end, this is a 
final opportunity to show 
your understanding of 
the relationship between 
negligence and the rule and 
whether there is scope for the 
former to apply in the latter.

➜ Explain the rule and its traditional function.
➜ Contrast the rule with the tort of nuisance.
➜ Evaluate the requirements to be satisfied under the rule, explaining why each is needed.
➜ Consider whether the rule should be retained, and in what form, or whether it should be 
abolished in favour of a tort such as negligence.
Answer
The rule in Rylands v Fletcher (1866) LR 1 Ex 265 has long given 
redress to those whose land is damaged by the escape of something 
from their neighbour’s land which is not naturally there. However, judi-
cial thinking now treats the rule as part of nuisance, and this in turn 
has caused academics to question the ongoing merit of retaining the 
rule; indeed abolition has occurred in Australia and was considered in 
Transco plc v Stockport MBC [2004] 2 AC 1.1 It is argued that the 
tort, properly understood, is distinct and so has a purpose for which 
it needs to be kept.
The rule in Rylands v Fletcher is that, where a person brings on to 
land which he controls something which is not there naturally and is 
something which will foreseeably cause harm to neighbouring land if 
it escapes, liability will result where that eventuality occurs.

you understand the premise 
of the question and how the

  Question 2
While it is one of several torts protecting land, the elements of the 
rule indicate its uniqueness. The rule targets the defendant’s activ-
ities, imposing strict liability when they bring something on to their 
land which risks harming another’s property. This could be seen as 
a response to industrialisation and the changing nature of land use 
to encompass more hazardous activities. Therefore, the rule differs 
from nuisance, which focuses on injury inflicted on the claimant’s 
land.2 The rule only refers to land under the defendant’s control and 
the focus is on material damage from that land. While nuisance has 
led to recovery for material damage to the land, the orthodox position 
is that it concerns amenity interference. Therefore, traditionally a clear 
divide between the purposes of the torts existed. Historically, owing to 
the purpose of the rule, no proprietary interest was needed for stand-
ing; however, it was stated obiter in Transco that this is required. 
Murphy (2004)3 has previously argued that nuisance developed to 
protect interests in land because of the link between land and social 
status, but this was not the reason behind the development of the 
rule and so it is questionable whether this requirement for standing is 
warranted which, if correct, confirms a distinct position for the rule. 
In Cambridge Water Co. v Eastern Counties Leather plc [1994] 
2 AC 264, adopting the analysis of Newark,4 Lord Goff held that the 
rule was a sub-species of nuisance, a position endorsed in Transco. 
Today, the rule exists to deal with one-off escapes of substances from 
the defendant’s land which cause harm,5 but the acceptance of New-
ark’s (1949) analysis has brought into question aspects of the tort.
For liability under the rule, the defendant must first bring something 
on to his land. This in itself does not need to be inherently danger-
ous, as seen in Rylands where the ‘thing’ was water. The ‘thing’ 
must then escape to an area not controlled by the defendant (Read v 
Lyons (1947] AC 156). As the ‘thing’ must be likely to do harm upon 
escape, one escape is sufficient, and so there is a further distinc-
tion from nuisance. Nuisance involves looking at factors such as the  
sensitivity of the claimant and the duration of the interference. There-
fore, certain acts may not equate to nuisance, but they would fall 
within the rule. Further, historically, personal injury was actionable 
under the rule; although the view of the rule as an extension of nui-
sance means this is no longer the case. Therefore, a return to its 
2 As the English position is 
that the rule is an extension 
of nuisance, early in your 
answer you should clearly set 
out the rule’s purpose and 
how it differs. However, if you 
are of the view that the rule 
is justifiably part of nuisance, 
then do the reverse. Make 
the case early as to why it 
is, and provide a platform 
from which you can discuss 
whether there is a role for the 
rule or not.

however, as explained 
elsewhere, in an exam you 
are unlikely to have time 
to write the full citation but 
naturally you must reference 
your influences. Therefore, 
give a clear and concise 
indication of your source. It is 
also important to distinguish 
this reference from the quote 
by Murphy in the question 
and make the reader aware 
that you are referring to a 
different text.
4 Show that you know what 
the wider reasoning was 
for Lord Goff’s opinion, 
particularly as it goes to the 
heart of the question: namely, 
whether the tort is needed if it 
is just a part of another tort.
5 After your analysis of the 
purpose of the tort, for clarity 
and to aid the flow into the 
elements of the tort, you 
should restate briefly what 
role the tort serves.

220
12  The rule in Rylands v Fletcher
origins would increase the merit in retaining the rule as it would be 
serving a wider function.6
The rule was originally stated by Blackburn J in Rylands as requiring 
the ‘thing’ to not naturally be on the land; however, this was amended 
in the House of Lords to ‘non-natural use’. This was interpreted in 
Rickards v Lothian [1913] AC 263 as a use which brings increased 
danger and is not merely the ordinary use of the land. This additional 
requirement has been doubted in Cambridge Water, but its essence 
was retained in Transco, albeit held that a test of extraordinary and 
unusual use was preferable.7 Lord Bingham emphasised that this 
may vary in different times and places; again, while having echoes 
of the assessed factors in nuisance, it must be remembered that 
what is being assessed is different. In nuisance, it is the interference, 
whereas under the rule it is the use of the land by the defendant. 
Further, a use may be extraordinary but reasonable in nuisance, but 
unreasonableness would not matter under the rule.
The final requirement is that harm from the thing’s escape is rea-
sonably foreseeable. This was added in Cambridge Water for 
the purposes of determining remoteness of damage. Lord Goff felt 
it important to affirm this point because of the similarity he saw 
between the rule and nuisance, where it is required.8 The basis for 
this requirement, however, is within the original rule itself where it 
talks about the ‘thing’ being ‘likely’ to cause mischief. Clearly, while 
the word was not used to determine this, it must be based upon 
foreseeability as this then justifies the strictness of liability.9
While the English judiciary have increasingly subsumed the rule 
within nuisance, Australia has completely abolished the rule, using 
negligence to cover the same situations instead.10 In Burnie Port 
Authority v General Jones pty (1994) 120 ALR 42, the idea of a 
non-delegable duty to be owed by those in control of premises was 
adopted. As the scope of negligence had, over time, been greatly 
expanded while the rule’s operation had been restricted, the differ-
ence between the two actions was now negligible and incidents cov-
ered by the rule were also captured within negligence, in fact more 
so in light of the current restrictions on personal injury claims under 
the rule. Countering this, Murphy (2004) suggested relying on negli-
gence instead of the rule may be detrimental in industrial use cases, 
as it will be harder for claimants to prove the necessary standard 
6 As you discuss each 
requirement, you should try to 
show how this supports the 
rule’s retention or otherwise 
so that you are fully dealing 
with the question at all times.
7 What you should be trying 
to do here is show that you 
appreciate how the phrase has 
developed through the case law 
but without getting too bogged 
down and losing some of the 
thrust of your structure, which 
is the level of distinctiveness 
between the two torts.
8 By stating this you are trying 
to balance your argument 
by showing support for the 
view that the two torts are 
the same, particularly when 
the relationship with nuisance 
was not necessarily needed to 
decide the point in the case.
9 Then go on to test the merit 
of the previously advanced 
view by seeing if the link to 
nuisance was needed.
10 What you are about to do 
here is to engage with the 
final aspect of the question –  
whether liability under the 
rule should be abolished 
regardless of whether it 
is an independent tort or 
not. You should already 
have considered whether it 
serves a different function 
to nuisance, so now you are 
demonstrating your extended 
knowledge by evaluating the 
alternative argument that 
the rule can be covered by 
negligence, and so is not 
needed.

221
  Question 2
was breached; additionally, safety compliance certificates may deter 
people from even trying. Further, Nolan (2005) argued that while the 
gap between the rule and fault-based liability was never that great in 
practice, the fault inherent within the rule is not the same as modern 
negligence. For example, Transco confirmed the reasonableness of 
the use of land by the defendant is irrelevant. Therefore, the rule is 
theoretically different to negligence and could often result in a differ-
ent outcome with greater hardship for claimants.
In conclusion, there would be nothing wrong with the rule being an 
offshoot of nuisance, provided that it could retain its value by still 
keeping with its original purpose. In light of the differences between 
the two, it is not possible for the rule to retain its distinctiveness, and 
thus its worth. As such it would be best if the rule were separated 
from the sphere and influence of nuisance. This would negate any 
question of abolishing the rule11 and be fairer than leaving claimants 
to seek redress in the theoretically different tort of negligence as 
businesses would have to internalise the risks of their activities.12
11 This statement further 
justifies your concluding 
position on the nature of 
the rule and addresses the 
second part of the question 
with regards to keeping the 
rule.
12 If your view is that 
negligence is not sufficient 
and that there is a role for the 
tort, round off your argument 
by summing up your thinking. 
Drawing on this point allows 
you to bring your position 
back to one of the original 
justifications for creating the 
rule.

How this topic may come up in exams
Trespass to the person consists of assault, battery and false imprisonment, but each 
is relatively small in size and straightforward to apply to the facts, so it is common 
for all of them to appear in the same problem question. You need to take the time to 
check the scope of how you are taught this tort to determine whether you can expect 
other torts alongside it, such as the rule from Wilkinson v Downton or other forms 
of trespass. Essays will be rarer, but when they do arise will look at the purpose, 
effectiveness and justification of the tort.

  Question 1
  Question 1
Following a government announcement of changes to student funding, a student demon-
stration was organised, which was to include a rally in Academic Square. To try to ensure 
the peacefulness of the rally, the police allowed some protesters to enter the Square but, as 
intelligence had shown the rally might turn violent as the day went on, the police formed a 
line across all entrances to the Square and refused to allow anyone to enter or leave.
In anger at what he felt was the denial of his right to join the protest, Roy threw a dustbin 
at the police, although it missed the officers, it did smash a police car window. PC Barnes, 
having seen where the bin was thrown from, ran over and, believing Sandra had thrown the 
bin, pushed her to the floor yelling, ‘That was utter madness; you’ll pay the consequences 
for that.’ Sandra was taken to a nearby police station. However, it was later proven that she 
had not thrown the bin and she was released. An administrative error meant though that 
the information was not passed to the custody officer, and Sandra had been detained for 26 
hours by the time of her release.
Harriet had arrived at the Square to join the rally. However, she was informed by PC Arthur 
that she was too late and would have to protest elsewhere. Furious, Harriet yelled at PC 
Arthur, ‘I know my rights! You need to let me past now!’ PC Arthur just laughed at her, and 
informed Harriet that if she carried on he would arrest her. Harriet disconsolately threw a 
banner that she was carrying at PC Arthur’s face and walked away.
Shocked, PC Arthur shouted back, ‘You wouldn’t be walking away if the Sergeant wasn’t over 
there, you would be heading off in the ambulance. Remember, though, I can find out where 
you live.’

➜ Evaluate the elements of assault and determine whether Harriet will have a claim.
Answer
The instances which have occurred during the demonstration poten-
tially give rise to several claims under the tort of trespass to the per-
son. This tort comprises assault, battery and false imprisonment, with 
all three requiring discussion on the facts. That it is these torts in 
question are significant because each is actionable per se without 
any need to show that the respective claimants have suffered any 
harm. This is because the interests that the tort protects are bodily 
integrity and liberty, and thus they are deemed to warrant heightened 
protection from even the slightest interference.1 Each incident will be

  Question 1
taken in turn2 with advice being given to those who have allegedly 
been the victim of the torts. It will be argued that, while PC Arthur has 
a claim for battery, and Sandra for false imprisonment and possibly 
battery, Harriet will be unsuccessful in any claim.
The first incident involves Sandra, who should be advised as to false 
imprisonment where ‘false’ effectively means unlawful. False impris-
onment requires intentionally and directly causing the total restraint 
of the claimant within an area set by the defendant, without lawful 
authority for doing so (Bird v Jones (1845) 7 QB 742). It is clear 
that PC Barnes did completely restrain Sandra as she was pushed to 
the ground and then taken to a police station, and this was all clearly 
intentional, particularly in light of his comments.3 Obviously, the police 
have the lawful authority to make arrests, but to be lawfully justified 
they must follow the procedures of the Police and Criminal Evidence 
Act (PACE) 1984. First, under section 24, PC Barnes needs to have 
had reasonable grounds for suspecting that Sandra had committed 
an offence. An offence has clearly been committed by throwing the 
bin, and it came from the vicinity where Sandra was. We are not told 
why Sandra was picked out as opposed to anyone else, but so long 
as PC Barnes had reasonable grounds, this would be justified thus 
far. The issue comes, however, with how the arrest was conducted. 
Under section 28, Sandra would need to be informed that she was 
under arrest and the basis for this. We are not told that this was 
not complied with, but from what we are told was said, it appears 
unlikely.4 The section specifies that it must be complied with even 
where it is obvious. Here it would not be, especially if Sandra had 
seen Roy throw the bin. If not done at the time, it must be done as 
soon as is reasonably practicable afterwards. There does not appear 
any reason on the facts why it could not have been done at the time. 
If it was not done, the arrest and detention are unlawful, and Sandra 
would have an action for false imprisonment, and also battery5 from 
when she was pushed to the ground.
Even if the initial arrest and detention6 are deemed to be lawful, it 
appears that Sandra would still have a claim based on the amount 
of time that she spent in custody. Once the reasons for detention are 
known to no longer apply a person should be released (s. 34, PACE). 
In any event, the maximum time spent in custody without charge 
can only be 24 hours. Even though this was ‘an administrative error’, 
Sandra should be advised that acting in good faith is no justification

making assumptions on this, 
but do give a view as to what 
is likely to be the case.
5 Don’t overlook the fact that, 
in order to arrest somebody, 
you need to touch them. If the 
arrest is unlawful, so is the 
touching, and therefore there 
is another action that Sandra 
can bring.
6 Phrase this in this way to 
distinguish what you have just 
discussed, and what therefore 
may be lawful, with what you 
are about to discuss, which 
is the extended period of 
detention.

228
13  Trespass to the person 
for restricting a person’s liberty (Evans v Governor of Brockhill 
Prison [2001] 2 AC 19). Therefore, even if the initial arrest and period 
of detention was justified, once it became known that she did not 
commit the offence and she was not released, she has an action for 
false imprisonment.
The next incident concerns PC Arthur, who appears to have a clear 
claim against Harriet for battery.7 A battery is an intentional, imme-
diate and direct act which causes unlawful physical contact with the 
claimant. In relation to the first factor, even if Harriet asserts that she 
did not intend to hit PC Arthur when she threw the banner, subjective 
recklessness will suffice (Bici v Ministry of Defence [2004] EWHC 
786). While it could be argued that the contact was made by the 
banner and not Harriet, this is irrelevant and there is long-standing 
authority that an intervening object may be used such as Pursell v 
Horn 112 ER 966. Strengthening PC Arthur’s claim is the fact that, 
although Harriet threw the banner disconsolately as she walked away, 
a lack of hostility on her part will not defeat a claim. One of the ear-
liest definitions of battery was said by Lord Holt CJ in Cole v Turner 
(1704) 87 ER 907 to be ‘the least touching of another in anger’, which 
suggests a hostility requirement in order to make the touching unjus-
tifiable,8 and this was certainly the view taken in Wilson v Pringle 
[1987] QB 237. In F v West Berkshire Health Authority [1990] 2 
AC 1, however, Lord Goff explained that using hostility as the quali-
fication for whether touching becomes unlawful ignores the fact that 
actions such as a slap on the back and non-consensual surgery are 
both battery yet both lack hostility. Instead what would take Harriet’s 
actions outside of the remit of battery9 is if they could be said to be 
within the bounds of generally accepted standards of everyday life. 
It would be very hard for her to successfully argue that throwing an 
object, especially the object in question, at someone performing their 
job simply because she could not get her way would be acceptable, 
and thus this is a battery.10
Finally, Harriet may claim for an assault by PC Arthur. Clearly, the 
words used by PC Arthur indicate a willingness to inflict a battery 
on Harriet by having her require an ambulance. However, assault is 
causing the claimant to reasonably apprehend the immediate infliction 
of a battery (Thomas v NUM [1986] Ch 20). It is the requirement of 
reasonable apprehension which will see any claim defeated, as PC 
Arthur’s words signify that he has no intention of actually injuring 
7 At this stage you have not 
established on the facts 
that the tort has been made 
out, so regardless of the 
apparently clear-cut nature 
of the incident, do not refer 
to the incident just yet as a 
definite tort, although you can 
be a bit more assertive than 
usual in your language.
8 Explain why there is a debate 
as to hostility. This allows you 
to show your knowledge and 
analytical skills.
9 Make sure that you use 
a phrase such as this to 
emphasise why the hostility is 
taking place.
10 Now that you have fully 
gone through the tort and 
evaluated its applicability, you 
should fully assert that it is a 
battery.

229
  Question 1
Harriet because his sergeant is nearby. His words, as in Tuberville 
v Savage (1669) 86 ER 684, in fact negate any assault. The second 
comment as to knowing where she lives would also arguably lack 
any sufficient immediacy so as to be actionable either, even if the 
comment was deemed to lead to the reasonable apprehension of a 
battery.11
To conclude, Harriet will not have any claim following the incidents, 
but may find herself sued for battery by PC Arthur. The Chief Con-
stable of the police force will possibly face an action for false impris-
onment and battery by Sandra if it is established PC Barnes failed to 
comply with PACE.
11 Don’t forget about this 
additional comment by PC 
Arthur as it could be said 
to be an assault, but it has 
a different focus as to why 
the claim may not succeed. 
Therefore, your answer would 
not be complete without 
mentioning it.

  Question 2
Francesco and Edoardo were walking home from university one day, taking the path which 
runs alongside a very wide, deep and fast-flowing river. As they were walking they saw 
Bubba and Dustin approaching on the other side of the river on their way to the local golf 
course. The four had recently had an argument after Edoardo had reported Bubba and Dustin 
for cheating in an exam which saw Bubba being expelled while Dustin was found innocent.
When Bubba saw Edoardo he yelled, ‘You are dead for reporting me; I am going to put you 
in hospital for that!’ Edoardo, feeling scared, decided to run so he could get home quickly. 
Feeling aggrieved by being reported when he was innocent, Dustin decided to chip a golf 
ball across the river at Edoardo as he ran off. However, he misjudged the shot and instead 
struck Francesco – who had decided to carry on walking home – in the back of the head.
When Edoardo got home, he decided to get his own back by ringing Bubba’s house and 
playing a prank on Bubba’s elderly grandfather, Zach, with whom Bubba lived, by informing 
him that Bubba had been run over and killed on his way to the golf course and that the 
police would probably be with Zach shortly. Upon hearing this Zach went into shock.
Advise Bubba, Dustin and Edoardo as to any liability they may face.

  Question 2
Answer
Bubba and Dustin will need to be advised respectively as to the torts 
of assault and battery, actions which overall constitute the tort of tres-
pass to the person. These protect a person’s bodily integrity and are 
actionable without proof of actual harm. This reflects the importance 
that tort places on this interest.1 Edoardo’s advice differs slightly in 
that he faces liability under the rule in Wilkinson v Downton [1897] 
2 QB 57 which, while related to trespass owing to it having an element 
of intention, is a separate tort.2 Each will be advised in turn.
The tort which Bubba may be liable for is assault. This is intentionally 
causing a person to reasonably apprehend the immediate infliction of 
a battery. The fact that Edoardo ran off scared after hearing Bubba’s 
threat would suggest that he felt he was going to attack him. However, 
Bubba should be advised that this is not sufficient to establish liability 
and, as in Thomas v NUM [1986] Ch 20, there are two aspects of 
the definition which should mean that Bubba will escape liability.3 The 
first is that the carrying out of the threat, the infliction of the battery, 
must be immediate. We are told that they were on different sides of 
a river which, from the description given, would appear impassable. 
This would mean that it was not possible for Bubba to actually perform 
the unlawful touching necessary for battery immediately. Even though 
some delay is permissible (R v Ireland [1998] AC 147), Edoardo 
would still need to reasonably believe that the battery is imminent, 
which, on the facts seems unlikely. This leads into the second aspect 
of the definition which is an issue here,4 namely the reasonableness of 
the apprehension. It is not sufficient that Edoardo subjectively felt that 
he was about to be hit, it must, objectively on the facts, be reasonable 
for him to apprehend this event. As it seems there was no possibility 
of Bubba crossing the river, and therefore no immediate danger, any 
apprehension he felt was not reasonable as Bubba was not going to 
be able to carry out the threat.
Dustin faces liability under the tort of battery. This is defined as an 
intentional, immediate and direct act which causes unjustifiable phys-
ical contact with the claimant. From the facts, there is clearly no issue 
around the requirement for an immediate act. Additionally, although it 
is a golf ball which makes contact rather than Dustin physically touch-
ing Francesco, this will also not matter; it is clear from case law that 
direct does not mean instantaneous and an intervening object can be 
1 By briefly demonstrating 
here your understanding of 
tort, you can get into the 
main premise of the question 
quickly so that you have 
enough time to fully evaluate 
the issues arising from the 
facts. You can then refer 
back to the tort’s nature as 
required.
2 Keep this brief as it is only 
the introduction. Set out 
in depth what the tort is 
about when you come to 
discuss Edoardo’s liability. 
Simply show that you have 
appreciated that the rule 
is distinct and requires 
discussion.
3 The reason for only including 
the name of the case here is 
that you are seeking to draw 
a parallel with the facts of the 
case in order to use this as 
the authority for the argument 
which you will go on to 
advance. There will be no 
need to then state the facts 
as the marker will know from 
how you have structured the 
sentence that the two aspects 
of the definition which you are 
discussing were at issue in 
Thomas v NUM.
4 This is why, although 
‘reasonable’ comes first in the 
definition, you should address 
it second in your answer.

232
13  Trespass to the person 
used (e.g. in Hopper v Reeve (1817) 129 ER 278, where throwing 
water over someone was a battery). Dustin should be advised that 
even though his intention was to hit Edoardo rather than Francesco, 
this will not enable him to avoid liability. What must be intended is 
the act and not the result (Bici v Ministry of Defence [2004] EWHC 
786), so Dustin’s intention to hit Edoardo will simply be transferred to 
hitting Franceso. The application of the concept of transferred malice 
was first acknowledged in English law in Bici and one of the reasons 
for its application is by analogy with the criminal law. However, its 
application has been firmly rejected by Beever’s (2009) article in the 
Legal Studies journal.5 He argues that, unlike criminal law, in tort the 
identity of the claimant has significant importance and is essential to 
the cause of action and therefore the analogy does not work and the 
doctrine should not apply. If this were the case, then Dustin, by not 
intending to strike Francesco, would not be liable to him for battery.6 
Therefore as Bici is only a High Court judgment, it is open for Dustin 
to defend any claim by Francesco on the basis that the doctrine should 
not apply in tort, but he should be advised that as the law currently 
stands he will be liable for battery. However, Dustin should be advised 
that even if successful on this point, it may instead lead to him being 
liable in negligence.7
In relation to Edoardo, the harm which his actions have led to did 
not flow directly from what he did: it was more indirect harm. As 
such, he could not face any claim under trespass.8 However, where 
someone intentionally conducts themselves in a way which causes 
indirect harm, the rule in Wilkinson may be used to impose liability. 
In Wilkinson, a prank call caused the recipient to suffer psychiatric 
injury, which was not recoverable at the time in negligence. The judge 
found the defendant liable on the basis that he had wilfully done 
an unjustified act calculated to cause harm; therefore, the intention 
to cause the harm which occurred was imputed by the judge. This 
appears very similar to what has happened with Edoardo. The rule 
was subjected, though, to extensive analysis in Wainwright v Home 
Office [2004] 2 AC 406 where it was held that imputed intention 
should not be used and that there must be an actual intention to 
cause harm, or the defendant would need to have acted without car-
ing whether he caused harm. We are not told that Edoardo had an 
intention to cause harm, but it would seem that he was at the very 
least not caring whether he caused harm. The question is what sort 
5 You will not need to write the 
full article title and citation, 
but provide your marker with 
enough indication as to which 
work you are referring to.
6 This is why it is worth 
commenting on the academic 
discussion around this issue, 
as it could form the basis 
of Dustin avoiding liability, 
which is what your task is 
essentially. More importantly, 
this also allows you to add to 
the analytical depth of your 
answer.
7 Although the question is not 
on negligence, show your 
wider knowledge of tort by 
highlighting that you have 
seen further potential liability 
from Dustin’s actions.
8 By highlighting why Edoardo 
could not be sued in trespass, 
you not only show more 
depth to your understanding 
of that tort, you also create 
a platform from which to 
introduce the rule in Wilkinson 
v Downton.

233
  Question 2
of harm Edoardo’s phone call has caused. We are told that Zach went 
into shock but no more. If this is a fully recognised psychiatric injury, 
then Edoardo is very likely to face liability either under the rule or in 
negligence. In Wainwright, Lord Hoffmann felt negligence was the 
better cause of action but subsequently the rule was used for this type 
of injury in C v D [2006] EWHC 166.9 However, if the ‘shock’ was in 
fact merely a case of distress, then it would appear that Edoardo will 
not face any liability. Lord Hoffmann stated the rule does not provide a 
remedy in such instances and, while he was cautious about creating a 
tort of intentionally causing distress to deal with such a scenario, Lord 
Scott was strongly opposed to the idea, a view adopted in Mbasogo 
v Logo Ltd [2007] QB 846.
In conclusion, Bubba is unlikely to face any liability for assault, but 
Dustin is likely to be liable for battery, even if Dustin can avoid this, 
he may instead be liable in negligence. Determining the position of 
Edoardo requires more evidence as to the nature of Zach’s injury. If it 
was simply distress that was suffered, he will not be liable, but if he 
suffered a medically recognised psychiatric injury, then Edoardo will 
face liability under the rule in Wilkinson or alternatively in negligence.
9 Your aim is to pass 
comment on the rule, not 
to argue whether there is 
negligence. As the rule has 
been subjected to significant 
criticism, you should 
reproduce this and assess 
whether it is a suitable basis 
of liability for Edoardo.

  Question 3
Yvette (22) and Ed (21), two university students, had been sitting at a table on the patio of a 
coffee shop owned by Chuka, a small, elderly man in his sixties. A sign states that the patio 
area is only to be used by paying customers. As the pair had not purchased anything for 
about two hours and the shop was getting busy, Chuka approached them and asked if they 
were finished they could leave so that other customers could use the table. After a further 30 
minutes, with the pair still there, Chuka return and shouted, ‘If you lazy spongers don’t clear 
off now, I will have to throw you off my property myself, you know!’ Chuka then went to shoo 
them away with a wet tea towel. Yvette was hit, however, and in trying to avoid it she rocked 
back on her chair. This was done too fast and she fell backwards, falling on a metal railing 
which pierced her body. Chuka rushed forward to help, but fearing that Chuka was about to 
attack him next, Ed picked up a glass ashtray and struck Chuka in the face, with it causing a 
broken jaw.
Yvette was taken to hospital where she was seen to by Dr Burnham who rushed her into 
emergency surgery. Due to the level of blood loss, Dr Burnham conducted a blood transfu-
sion. Naturally, Yvette was unconscious at the time and gave no consent for the procedure. 
Due to her religious beliefs, Yvette would not have consented even if she was conscious. Dr 
Burnham insisted that she would have died without it.

are actionable without proof of damage, clearly some damage has 
occurred here. However, the issue, particularly for the latter two acts,

13  Trespass to the person 
The first issue is whether Chuka is liable for assaulting Yvette and 
Ed. For an assault, there must be an intentional and direct act which 
causes another to reasonably apprehend the immediate infliction of a 
battery, the unlawful touching of that person.2 Arguably, Chuka had 
a clear intention as he wants them to go away from his shop and the 
threat was designed to make them leave, and the act is obviously 
direct.3 Chuka should be advised that this is likely to be a reasonable 
apprehension by Yvette and Ed even though he gave them a way of 
avoiding any battery. His words simply amounted to a conditional 
threat as in Read v Coker (1853) 138 ER 1437 and as such, this is 
not a situation where the words said negate any apprehended threat 
(Tuberville v Savage (1669) 86 ER 684). Chuka made clear that if 
they did not voluntarily leave, he would physically remove them and 
thereby sought to exert control over their movement and personal 
autonomy.4 Yvette and Ed do not have to have been placed in fear, 
just simply to have anticipated Chuka would make contact with them. 
Provided his words would objectively cause the apprehension of the 
battery, which is supported by the movement towards them having 
previously hit Yvette with the tea towel, Chuka will be liable for the 
assault.
Chuka faces a more clear-cut case of liability for battery against 
Yvette. Battery is the intentional, direct touching of another without 
lawful justification. Intention must relate to intending to make contact 
with the person, and contact may be direct even if an intervening 
object has been used to achieve it (Hopper v Reeve (1817) 7 Taunt 
698). We are told that Chuka simply intended to shoo them away 
which is not enough information to determine the matter;5 however, 
under Bici v Ministry of Defence [2004] EWHC 786 (QB) subjective 
recklessness will suffice. Therefore, this is likely to amount to battery.
Ed also faces liability for battery. It is clear that by striking Chuka with 
the ashtray Ed has satisfied all of the elements of the tort.6 Ed could 
avoid liability by proving he acted in self-defence and, therefore, the 
touching was, in fact, justified and so not a battery. Ed’s issue is that 
while he felt Chuka was going to attack him imminently, he was mis-
taken. Under the criminal law, acting under an honest, but mistaken, 
belief is sufficient for self-defence irrespective of how unreasonable 
the mistaken belief was (R v Williams (Gladstone) [1987] 3 All ER 
411).7 However, self-defence is different in tort, and the mistaken 
belief must have been reasonable to hold (Ashley v Chief Constable 
2 Obviously, you have not 
defined battery yet, so provide 
a brief explanation here. This 
will enable you to apply the 
requirements of assault to this 
situation more easily.
3 Do not forget to apply this 
aspect. Generally, you would 
need to substantiate this 
statement but here, on the 
facts, there really is no issue 
of this not being a direct act. 
Therefore, this would suffice.
4 Rather than just show 
your knowledge of both of 
these cases, make sure 
you demonstrate that you 
understand the difference 
between them by explaining 
why one is considered 
unacceptable.
5 Use the absence of clear 
factual evidence to support 
why you are not being more 
decisive.
6 Again this is self-evident so 
you should simply state this 
fact and move on to the main 
discussion point of whether 
the touching was justified 
as an act of self-defence. 
As you have defined battery 
above, there is no need to do 
so again.
7 Although a tort answer, you 
are still making an assertion 
of legal principle to set out 
your argument, so you should 
cite the criminal law authority 
for it. Your aim is to compare 
the two approaches and show 
that you have a real grasp of 
the basis of tort law and the 
principles underpinning it.

237
  Question 3
of Sussex [2008] UKHL 25). Lord Scott8 noted the different purposes 
of tort and crime. Therefore, if tort adopted the same approach to 
self-defence, the wrong balance would be struck between a person’s 
right not to be subjected to physical harm and another’s right to pre-
vent an imminent attack with reasonable force. As a person’s liberty 
would be at stake, not imposing a criminal sanction on a person in 
such circumstances is justifiable. However, setting aside one’s right 
to physical integrity based on an unreasonably held belief would not 
be justifiable. Therefore, Ed’s liability rests on the reasonableness 
of his belief that he was going to be imminently attacked. Arguably, 
Chuka’s demeanour could suggest an imminent physical attack. How-
ever, much depends on how the words were said and his demeanour. 
Further, the proximity of Ed to Yvette would be a factor. If there was 
distance between them it is hard to maintain a belief that Ed rea-
sonably thought Chuka was coming for him. Overall, while perhaps 
honest, the reasonableness of the belief is questionable which might, 
in turn, raise questions over whether there was an assault by Chuka.9
However, even if Ed satisfies the reasonableness requirement, he 
must also have acted proportionately to the threat posed by Chuka 
(Lane v Holloway [1968] 1 QB 379). Here Chuka was, at the time in 
question, unarmed and significantly older that Ed, yet Ed struck him in 
the face with a glass ashtray. This could be said to be disproportionate 
and so Ed would be liable for the battery.
The remaining issue is whether Dr Burnham is liable in battery for 
operating on Yvette without her consent. By performing the transfu-
sion, the initial elements of a battery are clearly present. The issue 
is whether this was a justifiable intrusion of Yvette’s physical integ-
rity due to the situation. Liability will, therefore, rest on whether the 
intrusion was justified on the grounds of necessity. If so justified, 
the fundamental essence of the tort, unlawfulness, is missing.10 This 
issue is governed by F v West Berkshire HA [1990] 2 AC 1 and the 
touching must be shown to be necessary in the circumstances, and 
that it was not practicable to communicate with Yvette. As she was 
unconscious, it was clearly not possible to ask for her consent. There-
fore, it must be considered whether it was practicable to wait until she 
regained consciousness. We are told that Dr Burnham felt it was an 
emergency and Yvette would have died from the blood loss without 
the transfusion.11 While this needs to be proven, on that basis12 it was 
not practicable to wait to seek Yvette’s consent.
8 All of the judges stated an 
opinion on this so remember 
to be specific as to who you 
are referring to, as this shows 
that you have a greater level 
of knowledge of the case.
9 Raise this as a prospect 
in order to show that you 
appreciate the connection 
between the two torts.
10 The point of writing your 
answer in this way rather 
than talking about the 
‘defence’ of necessity is 
that it indicates you have a 
deeper understanding of the 
tort by recognising that, if the 
touching is not unlawful, there 
is no tort from the start – not 
that there was a tort but a 
defence applies to negate 
liability.
11 It is important on this point 
to make sure to draw on the 
specific factual wording of 
the question to support the 
conclusion you are forming.
12 You have just created 
some doubt, so make sure 
you clearly explain that you 
are proceeding with your 
advice on the basis that it will 
be proven. Otherwise your 
answer could lack coherence.

238
13  Trespass to the person 
The action taken must also have been reasonable in the circum-
stances in which it occurred. This requires evidence from a reasona-
ble body of medical opinion demonstrating support for Dr Burnham’s 
action. We are not told whether this is the case, but if it was a life and 
death matter it would be likely. If it was reasonable, there would be no 
liability under F. However, in any event, Dr Burnham should be advised 
that any claim would probably be brought against the hospital under 
the doctrine of vicarious liability. Therefore, even if the transfusion 
was an unjustified intrusion, and thus there was a battery, he should 
avoid personal liability for his performance of the operation13 (Cassidy 
v Ministry of Health [1951] 2 KB 343).
In conclusion, Chuka is likely to be found liable for assault and battery; 
Ed is also likely to be liable for battery as, even if deemed reasonable, 
it was potentially disproportionate. Dr Burnham and/or the hospital 
will, however, not be liable due to his acting out of necessity.
13 In terms of advising Dr 
Burnham of his liability, this 
would be an important piece 
of information for him and 
impacts ultimately on whether 
he would be held liable or 
not. Although no specific 
mention is made of advising 
the hospital, or of vicarious 
liability, by mentioning this 
you will gain marks for having 
recognised that the doctrine 
will operate here.

‘At the level of enforcement, rights do not permit trade-offs between the interests of the 
right-holder and of the right-infringer. Such trade-offs take place at the earlier stage of 
right-definition. This is mirrored in the distinction between defences and justifications: 
justifications are part of the definition of the right whereas defences are trade-offs at the 
level of enforcement.’

  Question 4
Answer
Trespass is one of the oldest torts protecting individuals from unjusti-
fied, intentional harm. Consisting of battery, assault and false impris-
onment, it seeks to provide meaning to one’s right to physical integrity 
and liberty by imposing liability without the need to prove any damage 
was suffered due to the intentional infringement of the right.1 Pro-
tection is strong as vindication of an infringed right is not prevented 
through the pleading of a defence; however, this raises issues in 
respect of personal autonomy and criminal justice. Therefore, certain 
actions are justified in order to balance the competing rights of others. 
Where the defendant’s actions are justified there is no tort in the first 
instance as the key characteristic of unjustness is missing, whereas 
a defence to an action implies that a tort has been made out initially.2
Battery is the direct and intentional unlawful touching of another, 
although subjective recklessness will suffice (Bici v Ministry of 
Defence [2004] EWHC 786). It aims to protect physical integrity by 
prohibiting any form of unjustified molestation, not just touching which 
causes injury (F v West Berkshire HA [1990] 2 AC 1). This reflects 
the sacrosanct nature of physical integrity meaning the smallest 
infringement, even an unwanted kiss, is prohibited.
The defendant’s intention to make contact justifies such a strong 
approach. If actual harm is necessary, the protection afforded is 
greatly reduced, the system for vindicating one’s rights is far simpler 
by merely requiring that there should be no unjustified touching rather 
than assessing the degree of touching. Liability will arise even if an 
object is used to make contact with the claimant (Pursell v Horn 
112 ER 966) or if the intentional act was originally directed at a third 
party (Bici ). In this latter scenario, the intention is transferred to the 
person who was actually touched.
Clearly this could greatly restrict one’s right to freedom of action; 
greater harm to the claimant could even be caused if all touching 
required consent to be justified. For example, doctors could not per-
form emergency operations on unconscious patients. Therefore, the 
law has sought to reasonably restrict the tort’s application by cre-
ating categories of lawful touching. It is for this reason why Cane 
(1999) highlights the distinction between defences and justifications 
in trespass.3 These situations go to the heart of what battery is and 
1 Structurally it makes more 
sense if you deal with the 
generic theoretical aspects of 
the tort first before going into 
depth on each component 
tort. This passage should 
be written as an extended 
introduction and then it can 
act as your foundation for the 
answer from which the rest of 
your arguments build.
2 This may just read like a 
restatement of the quote, but 
it is important that you include 
a passage such as this in your 
answer, in your own words. 
This shows firstly that you 
understand what the quote 
means and allows you to tie 
it in to the overall theory and 
purpose of the tort.
3 Remember that the question 
asks you to evaluate the tort 
in light of the statement so do 
refer back to it in support of 
your points. Including a line 
such as this at the stage of 
introducing justifications for 
touching someone also shows 
that you have understood 
what Cane is suggesting in 
the quote.

242
13  Trespass to the person 
thus negate its existence. The key categories are necessity (F), self- 
defence (Ashley v Chief Constable of Sussex [2008] UKHL 25) 
and all touching within the bounds of what is acceptable as part of 
everyday life (F).
The first of these is clearly a justified intrusion so as to prevent a 
greater harm such as death or serious injury and covers the medical 
scenario above. The second is also needed as it allows one to prevent 
their physical integrity from being infringed themselves. The third cat-
egory covers ‘the exigencies of everyday life’ such as jostling in the 
street (per Lord Goff in F). However, reflecting tort’s overall approach 
to balancing conflicting rights and interests none of these automat-
ically make the touching lawful; there are set requirements outlined 
in the cases which must be satisfied in order to justify the touching.4
Physical integrity can also be infringed without actual touching, hence 
the tort of assault. Assault consists of an intentional, direct act which 
causes the claimant to reasonably apprehend the immediate infliction 
of a battery.5 The fact that a battery is unlawful means it is equally 
right to impose liability when someone intentionally causes another 
to apprehend that one will occur. Power and control can be exerted 
simply by threat of violence and one’s quality of life should not be 
hindered by the constant apprehension of a battery. One’s right to 
physical integrity would be hollowed as liability is avoided simply by not 
carrying out the threat, yet the consequence may be the same.6 Caus-
ing such a state of mind cannot be justified on any public policy basis. 
It should also be noted that as with battery a subjectively reckless 
act will suffice (Bici). Perhaps the most significant word in assault’s 
definition is ‘reasonable’. It is too great an infringement into another’s 
freedom of action if the claimant could succeed by simply perceiv-
ing a threat in non-existent circumstances, particularly when great 
emphasis is now placed on freedom of expression. Requiring reason-
ableness ensures that any restriction on freedom of expression is jus-
tified. A good illustration is Thomas v NUM where the striking miners 
had no way of actually reaching the non-strikers to commit battery 7  
and so any apprehension was unreasonable. Therefore, the full context 
must be considered. An assault can be carried out by simple gestures, 
words are not needed (R v Ireland [1998] AC 147); however, if words 
are present alongside an action, they must be considered in order to 
4 The question does not 
expressly ask for details of 
these, but at this stage of 
your answer, check how 
you are doing for time and 
perhaps add some detail 
here. The important point is 
to at least get across that the 
categories of justifications are 
needed to provide the balance 
which tort strives to achieve.
5 As battery is in the definition 
of assault, it is best to discuss 
it first as then you will have 
already defined this term, 
allowing you to now get 
straight into assault.
6 Offer some reasoning as 
to why the operation of 
assault is justified; this stops 
your answer becoming a 
descriptive piece on each 
tort. Instead you are showing 
analytical skills which will help 
you get more marks.
7 All you need here is to state 
enough of the basic facts to 
illustrate the point which you 
are making. So do not feel the 
need to go into more factual 
depth here than is stated.

243
  Question 4
assess whether they reinforce the reasonableness of the apprehension 
or in fact negate it (Tuberville v Savage (1669) 86 ER 684).
Finally, false imprisonment is the total restraint of someone with-
out lawful authority (Bird v Jones (1845) 7 QB 742). Therefore, 
the fundamental right to liberty is protected. Reflecting the impor-
tance of this right, liability arises from a restraint lasting the smallest 
amount of time and the claimant may not even need to realise they 
were restrained (Murray v Ministry of Defence [1988] UKHL 13). 
However, there is some doubt as to the validity of this view. Murray 
approved Meering v Graham-White Aviation (1919) 122 LT 44 
on this point, but the issue was only obiter. Subsequently, in R v 
Bournewood Mental Health Trust (ex parte L) [1999] 1 AC 458), 
the patient did not know that if he left his actual ward he would be 
detained. However, because he could physically leave the ward, there 
was deemed no total restraint as he could in theory leave that area. 
This would mean that the claimant must know of the restraint. Signif-
icantly, the minority view was favoured in HL v UK [2004] ECHR 471 
regarding a claim under Article 5, thus arguably if the situation arises 
again the Murray position will be adopted.8 This would better reflect 
the purpose of the tort otherwise a person drugged then taken, but 
released before gaining consciousness, would have no claim.
Clearly it would not be possible to have a criminal justice system or 
policing without some restraint justifiable. Therefore, the Prisons Act 
1952 permits imprisonment upon sentence or pending trial and PACE 
1984 provides the power to make arrests. However, in order to allow 
the police to perform their function while also ensuring that function 
is not abused and due process is observed, certain procedures must 
be followed. This is crucial in any democracy to prevent the devaluing 
of the tort’s protection.
Therefore, the three torts play a vital role in protecting one’s key right 
to personal integrity. The fact that they have existed for so long with-
out any fundamental restructuring of principle suggests that they are 
doing this job effectively while not causing problems for day-to-day  
society by justifying actions which would otherwise infringe one’s 
physical integrity.9
8 Although this is not an 
English law authority, it 
is worth mentioning as it 
involved the same claimant 
and therefore you show that  
you know this and also 
that you understand the 
implications of the case.
9 The key to your conclusion 
in this answer is to offer a 
personal view as to whether 
a good balance has been 
struck between the rights 
that the tort protects and the 
conflicting interests of society. 
This should be a restatement 
of what you have been 
advancing throughout your 
answer.

■ Try and read the chapter on Trespass in Fifoot’s History and Sources of the Common 
Law: Tort and Contract (1970), Eversham: Greenwood Press as well as the essay from 
which the quote is taken. The first will provide you with material as to the historical pur-

and justifications which will allow you to discuss this more confidently in your answer.
■ Expand the discussion of the distinction when it comes to defences or justifications in

each tort and so prevent it from ever coming into being. This is contrasted to defences 
which acknowledge the presence of the tort but prevent liability.

these in depth and show your analysis and evaluation of the torts.

right up to Becki’s face, leaning her head in close and shouted, ‘If you ever do that again 
I’ll make sure you never work again.’ Becki, mistakenly thinking Candice had said, ‘I’ll make

The scope and media prominence of these issues make them a popular exam area. 
You should check your module to see the extent you cover the misuse of private 
information in conjunction with defamation as, while separate torts, they are linked. 
The structure of defamation and its defences lends itself well to problem questions. 
Whereas the wide-ranging arguments as to whether there should be a general tort 
protecting privacy and the development of a tort of misuse of private information 
means that this lends itself extremely well to essay questions, the opposite in relation 
to both is also common. Overall, it is important to know the influence of human rights 
on both torts as both consist of a balance between Articles 8 and 10.

  Question 1
  Question 1
Michael Paxman is an investigative reporter for The Westminster Echo, a weekly political 
news magazine with a sales circulation of 20,000, but whose stories are always picked up 
by larger news outlets. He has been looking into Peter Seldon MP who is also currently the 
housing minister with responsibility for planning applications, and before entering Parliament 
was a director of a national house-building company. Michael’s investigations have 
uncovered that Peter’s previous company has received preferential treatment in planning 
decisions. Additionally, he has established that Seldon had retained shares in the company 
which he has just sold for a sizeable profit after the company had obtained planning 
permission for a new town development. Michael has now published his investigation in the 
latest edition of The Westminster Echo; an extract on the front page reads:
‘Today we reveal how housing minister, Peter Seldon, joins the list of corrupt MPs who 
shame Parliament. Evidence indicates he is favouring former business associates in 
deciding planning applications. Not content with doing favours for those associates, he 
has also pocketed thousands of pounds from a shareholding in the company.’
Inside the magazine, however, the story states that Peter had registered the shares in the 
Register of Members’ Interests, and stresses that there is no evidence of him receiving 
financial payments from the company for the decision.
During a televised debate in the House of Commons on housing policy, Peter responds:
‘Michael Paxman, a two-bob journalist with a history of fabricating and plagiarising 
stories: it is he who brings shame on his profession.’
Advise both parties as to whether they have a claim for the respective comments in

  Question 1
Answer
The issue to consider is the validity of claims by both parties for defa-
mation. Such claims bring into focus the tension between protecting 
one’s reputation while recognising free speech and the need for a free 
press. This is significant here as the matter involves investigative jour-
nalism into parliamentary corruption. It will be argued that while both 
statements appear defamatory, the defence of privilege will protect 
Peter, but his own claim may be defeated due to the statement being 
in the public interest.
Advising Peter first, it should be noted that while the comment was 
by Michael any action should be brought against The Westminster 
Echo1 as ultimately being responsible for the story. Defamation is the 
publication of a statement about a person, which lowers their reputa-
tion in the eyes of society, and Peter should be advised that has two 
forms: libel and slander. The former is where the comment is made 
in a permanent format and is traditionally viewed2 as being actionable 
per se, meaning proof of damage is not needed. As the comment has 
been printed, it would be libel. Under section 1 of the Defamation Act 
2013, the statement must cause, or be likely to cause, serious harm 
to Peter’s reputation, and, as interpreted in Lachaux v Independent 
Print Ltd [2016] QB 402, this needs to be proven, although it can be 
inferred from a wide publication. This would all appear to be satisfied 
in light of the allegation, his position and the size of the publication. 
As such, three elements need satisfying.
The first requirement is whether the statement is defamatory, mean-
ing Peter’s reputation is lowered in the estimation of right-thinking 
members of society (Sim v Stretch [1936] 2 All ER 1237). This is 
determined with reference to the fair-minded and not unduly suspi-
cious reasonable person (Lewis v Daily Telegraph [1964] AC 234). 
There appears to be no issue here: looking at the front page extract, 
the allegation is that Peter is corrupt, making ministerial decisions 
for profit. However, under Charleston v News Group Newspapers 
[1995] 2 All ER 313, a passage cannot be taken in isolation where 
other parts negate the effect of the libel. From the overall story, it is 
clear that no financial wrongdoing is alleged. Therefore, Peter could 
not base a claim on such suggestions, but the story does not negate 
the allegation of corruption by favouring associates,3 which would 
1 In a defamation action it 
is important to note who 
the claim is against as it 
is an expensive process. A 
media organisation is well 
equipped to fight such claims, 
as opposed to an individual 
journalist, and this may have 
a bearing on whether Peter 
will want to bring a claim, 
especially if you advise 
him that the claim may not 
succeed.
2 As you will need to go on 
to explain, Lachaux has 
suggested the position under 
the Act is now different. By 
using this wording you can 
highlight your knowledge of 
the previous position and 
thus the significance of the 
change.
3 Not only is it important that 
you clarify for the purposes of 
this element which statement 
may be actionable, but it 
is also important when you 
discuss defences, so make 
sure you spell out what 
exactly it is that was said 
which was defamatory.

252
14  Interests in reputation and private information
lower the reputation of a politician in the public’s eyes. The second 
and third elements, that the statement refers to the claimant and is 
then published to a third party, respectively, are clearly satisfied as 
the article is about the housing minister, Peter Seldon, and has been 
printed in a national magazine.4
While Peter may have a claim for defamation, reflecting the need 
to create a balance with freedom of expression, several defences 
are recognised which may assist The Westminster Echo. These have 
recently been placed on a statutory footing by the Defamation Act 
2013. The first defence is whether the story is true (s. 2). The key 
imputation5 is that Peter is corrupt by favouring former associates in 
determining planning decisions and The Westminster Echo will need 
to show it is substantially true (s. 2(1)). The extract suggests Michael 
has evidence that Peter’s former company has received preferential 
treatment so this may be the case.
In the event of not being able to prove it is substantially true The 
Westminster Echo could rely on the section 4 defence6 of publication 
on a matter of public interest which has replaced the old defence from 
Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd [2001] 2 AC 127. Although it 
will apply in similar circumstances to the Reynolds defence, it aims 
to be clearer and simpler in its application, particularly by breaking 
the link with privilege. It is broader in that it applies to the statements 
of fact and opinions.7 The defence has two limbs: first the statement 
must be one of a matter of public interest (s. 4(1 (a))) and must be 
determined in light of all of the circumstances of the case (s. 4(2)). 
In light of the nature of the allegation this would clearly seem to be 
satisfied as it relates to a government minister abusing his position. 
Further, the public would want to know all aspects of the story as 
it involves how the government is operating and making important 
decisions notwithstanding any suggestions of corruption.
The second aspect of the defence is that The Westminster Echo rea-
sonably believed that publishing the statement was in the public inter-
est (s. 4(1)(b)). Peter must be advised that this is again determined in 
light of all of the circumstances of the case, and allowance must be 
given for editorial judgement (s. 4(4)). Under the old law, focus was 
given to how responsible the journalist had been in gathering the story 
4 As there are no contentious 
issues in the facts on these 
points, keep them brief to 
save you time to discuss the 
more relevant aspects.
5 Although the old law referred 
to the ‘sting’ and you may still 
see it used, this is the word 
in the section so demonstrate 
your knowledge by using it.
6 This is why you should 
discuss this defence second. 
It comes into play if the 
statement cannot be shown to 
be true so you can show your 
knowledge of both, whereas 
it would not make sense to 
talk about trying to show the 
statement is true if you have 
satisfied the other defence.
7 Set out some background to 
the new defence to provide 
some context and show 
your wider knowledge, but 
don’t get too diverted into a 
tangential discussion.

253
  Question 1
and the statement could not be motivated out of malice. However, 
while these concepts are not expressly covered by the new defence, 
similar considerations do apply.8 If The Westminster Echo has acted 
irresponsibly or maliciously, it would affect the reasonableness of 
their belief in the story being in the public interest. Indeed, it would 
also raise questions as to whether it was even in the public interest 
to publish the statement in the first place. Ultimately, the statement 
in issue – preferential treatment – is sufficiently integral to the overall 
story to warrant inclusion: it is the story itself, so the exercise of such 
editorial judgement can be justified. As we are informed that The 
Westminster Echo has evidence to support its claims, on the basis 
that it is credible and sourced responsibly, it would be reasonable to 
believe the public should know the allegation, especially as there is 
no apparent countervailing public interest in not publishing the story.9 
Therefore, The Westminster Echo would most likely have a defence 
to a claim by Peter.
In switching to advise Michael now, the matter would again be libel as, 
although it involved spoken words, the debate was televised (Broad-
casting Act 1996, s. 166). The words spoken are therefore published 
and by naming Michael directly it would be considered as referring 
to him.
Even though it is a common name, the context clearly refers to 
Michael (Jameel v Wall Street Journal Europe [2006] UKHL 44). 
There is also no apparent issue with the statement being defamatory, 
as it clearly suggests that Michael makes up his stories and copies 
the work of others.10 However, Peter will have the defence of absolute 
privilege. MPs, under Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1689, cannot 
be questioned in court on statements from parliamentary proceed-
ings. As the statement was made during a parliamentary debate, 
the defence will apply unless Peter waives his right to the defence 
under the Defamation Act 1996, s. 13. Otherwise, Michael cannot 
seek redress.
In conclusion, it appears that The Westminster Echo may well have a 
defence to any claim by Peter; however, Michael would certainly be 
unsuccessful in any claim against Peter.11
8 This allows you to show 
your knowledge of how the 
new and old defences relate 
to each other. Further, as the 
defence is still new it has 
not been developed through 
case law as yet; therefore, 
some of the old law will still 
be relevant for now to help 
explain some aspects.
9 Include something like this 
to indicate that you have 
picked up on the subtlety and 
nuance of the section in that 
something may be a matter of 
public interest, but would not 
be reasonable to publish in 
the public interest, e.g. claims 
of police incompetence not 
being reasonable to publish 
due to the impact on national 
security.
10 As before, you just need to 
simply apply the elements to 
the statement and show how 
they are made out.
11 Although you have 
effectively concluded each 
party’s claim and this may 
seem like repetition, you 
should round off the answer 
with a summary of the 
position.

poor and vulnerable’. His strong moral convictions have led to his TV show attracting millions 
of viewers and resulted in his receiving a vast income through endorsing various products.
However, investigative reporter Morgan Douglas found out that Kyle hosted a weekly poker 
night at his mansion. To protect his reputation, the poker nights are strictly private and by 
invitation only; the guests only ever include Kyle’s closest circle of friends. On the night of 
the March event, using long-range photography, Morgan managed to secretly take a photo 
of Kyle standing in his doorway with a pack of cards and some poker chips in his hand.
A fortnight later, Morgan’s newspaper, The Daily Reflection, ran a story with the headline: 
‘Springer’s gambling shame! “Moral” star in regular gambling sessions.’ The photos were

14  Interests in reputation and private information
Answer
The issue to determine here is the extent to which Kyle may have 
redress in tort for the publication of his hosting of poker nights and 
his subsequent rehabilitation. This will involve assessing the extent to 
which the law recognises rights to privacy and protects them under 
the tort of misuse of private information.1 It will be argued that Kyle 
may be entitled to damages because of the parallels with Campbell 
v MGN Ltd [2004] UKHL 22,2 depending on the level of detail pub-
lished in relation to his treatment.
Notwithstanding that privacy is a fundamental human right under 
Article 8 of the ECHR, which has been incorporated into English law 
by the Human Rights Act 1998, the absence of any horizontal effect 
between private citizens3 means that there is no general tort protect-
ing the invasions of privacy as has happened here. This was clearly 
stated in Wainwright v Home Office [2003] UKHL 53 which saw 
no need for its creation, particularly by the judiciary. However, Kyle 
should be advised that this does not mean he automatically has no 
redress. As Hunt (1998) has argued, while the courts do not have the 
power to create new rights to achieve compatibility with the ECHR, 
as public bodies they must develop and interpret existing laws in a 
manner which is compatible with Convention rights. Therefore, Kyle 
may have an action under the tort of misuse of private information 
which has developed out of the equitable doctrine of breach of con-
fidence. In developing this in light of the HRA, the requirement for a 
prior confidential relationship has gone4 (Campbell ).
To bring an action, Kyle will have to demonstrate that the informa-
tion published was private and thus protected by Article 8, and then 
demonstrate that his interest in this information remaining private 
outweighs the paper’s right of freedom of expression under Article 
10 (McKennit v Ash [2008] QB 73).
In proving the first requirement, the courts, following Campbell, 
employ a ‘reasonable expectation of privacy’ test. In Campbell, Lord 
Hope5 explained that where the information published is obviously 
identifiable as being private, a reasonable expectation of privacy 
would result. The fact that the poker games occurred in Kyle’s own 
home, and by strictly private invitation only, suggests that this infor-
mation can objectively be identified as private. Objectively looking 
1 Indicate your awareness 
of the extent of privacy 
protection in tort and what 
Kyle’s action could be.
2 By mentioning Campbell, you 
show the parallels between 
Kyle’s situation and Campbell, 
and how that authority will 
form the basis of your answer.
3 Use this wording to show 
your awareness of the context 
around the debate on privacy 
protection and the workings 
of the Act. This allows you 
to develop this point later to 
show how Kyle’s action may 
come about.
4 Demonstrate your 
knowledge of the background 
to the action and how it 
arose to make existing 
laws compatible with the 
Convention.
5 While there appears to be 
some agreement on this point 
by the majority, they all gave 
separate opinions and the 
minority only dissented on the 
application of the balance to 
be struck in the instant case. 
Therefore, you should be 
specific as to whom you are 
referring when referencing 
aspects of Campbell.

257
  Question 2
at the situation, as Campbell said we should, it would appear that 
people should have an expectation of privacy in relation to what they 
legally6 do with their friends at home, particularly as it has been held 
to attach to routine daily acts (Murray v Express Newspapers 
plc [2008] EMLR 12).7 The information of his gambling addiction 
and rehabilitation is clearly private and thus would warrant protec-
tion under Article 8. Therefore, it seems that Kyle had a reasonable 
expectation of privacy in relation to the matter.
However, Kyle should be aware that, just because he has an expec-
tation to privacy, it does not mean he has an automatic right to keep 
the information private. Under the breach of confidence action a pub-
lic interest defence always existed which has now been developed 
to balance Articles 8 and 10, which both Articles themselves make 
clear should happen where it is necessary for a democratic soci-
ety. Therefore, Kyle will have to show that his interest in keeping the 
information private outweighs any public interest in the story. Kyle 
may have problems here as the thrust of the information is that he 
is a habitual gambler when he has made a career out of denouncing 
such activities. This obviously leaves him open to charges of hypocrisy 
and as he is a public figure creates a public interest in highlight-
ing this. The same issue was the basis for the claim in Campbell 
except that it concerned drug-taking. In Campbell it was accepted 
by all, including the claimant, that a public interest in publicising her 
drug-taking existed in light of her previous denials. That marks an 
important distinction between these situations, as Campbell involved 
not only hypocrisy but also illegal activity, whereas Kyle’s gambling is 
legal. However, it must be considered that Kyle has made substantial 
sums of money from criticising those who organise gambling activ-
ities. Therefore, while legal, his actions do carry a sufficient public 
interest and thus there is sufficient reason for the paper to interfere 
with his privacy right.
Notwithstanding this potential public interest, Kyle should be advised 
that the information published must be proportionate to the legiti-
mate aim that is being pursued by the paper through the exercise 
of their freedom of expression: otherwise, a claim will succeed. This 
was explained in Campbell, as again involving a balancing exercise 
between the two conflicting rights. In Campbell, the publication of 
the information of the claimant’s condition and the fact that treatment 
6 Including this avoids 
questions as to your logic; 
if this were an illegal drug-
taking party, it might be 
harder to say that it should 
carry an expectation of 
privacy. You prevent the 
marker having issues with the 
proposition.
7 Mentioning this reinforces 
that acts within the home 
are capable of having a 
reasonable expectation of 
privacy.

258
14  Interests in reputation and private information
was being sought was deemed to be a proportionate response. How-
ever, the reason why Campbell succeeded in her claim was because 
the newspaper published details as to the nature of her treatment as 
well as photos of her leaving the treatment centre. This information 
was held to be disproportionate to the legitimate aim of highlighting 
her illegal drug-taking. To advise Kyle further we would need to know 
whether the paper merely stated that he was attending rehabilitation 
or went further.8 If it was just the former, then under the authority of 
Campbell any action would not succeed, but if further information 
as to his treatment was published, he could have a successful claim 
under the tort. While we do know that they have published photos 
of Kyle, these are distinguishable from Campbell9 in that they were 
simply of him at his house with the cards and poker chips. Although 
taken covertly, of him and of his house, these could be said to simply 
provide credibility for the claims in the story which the public has an 
interest in knowing, as a form of factual evidence unlike the Camp-
bell photos.
In conclusion, Kyle should be advised that it is unlikely he would have 
a successful claim merely for the revelation that he is a gambling 
addict receiving treatment, with the publication of the photo unlikely 
to change this. However, a claim may succeed if the story featured 
specific details as to his treatment. If this is the case, Kyle would be 
entitled to damages, although these tend to be low.10 He could also 
seek an order for delivery of any remaining photos and copies of the 
information which the paper still holds. He should also be advised that 
if the paper is seeking to publish a further story, he could then seek 
an injunction in order to prevent that additional publication.11
8 Remember we are not told 
this definitively and so you 
should not frame any statement 
more assertively than this.
9 Owing to the factual 
similarity to Campbell, a lot 
of your answer will require 
demonstration of your factual 
knowledge of Campbell and 
understanding of the law in 
order to compare and contrast 
it to Kyle’s situation and what 
Kyle may do.
10 This highlights your 
awareness that, unlike with 
libel, any action is unlikely to 
bring much compensation. 
Further, it is good to include 
as it is the sort of information 
a client may want to know 
before deciding whether to 
bring a claim.
11 While we are not told if this 
is the case, it is often how 
newspapers work in order 
to prolong stories over time; 
therefore, by referencing it 
in this way you show your 
knowledge of the other 
remedies available but in a 
context relevant to the question.

  Question 3
  Question 3
Dermott is an ageing but still famous singer who has just released a new album containing 
a series of love songs, which is a radical departure from his usual rock tracks. This followed 
his recent secret wedding to a young fan, Tulisa, and was recorded as a sign of his  
everlasting love for her, although only a handful of people in the record industry knew this. 
The album was exclusively reviewed in the influential music magazine, Top Hits! However, 
the review was quite negative, with the writer Louis Barlow ending by saying:
‘While it may seem out of place on the album musically in light of the reason for this change 
of music direction, it is surprising not to see a cover version of Money, Money, Money by 
Abba on there.’
Additionally, the online version of the review had a comment section where readers could 
leave their views. One blogger, ‘Singing Simon’ posted the following:
‘This album is so cheesy it should come with a sideboard of crackers and grapes. It may not 
be that bad if he could sing, but the way he tries to hit the high notes on track 6 is  
laughable! This is the voice of an angel . . . being throttled! I feel so let down.’
To leave a comment, people must register their personal details with the magazine. To gauge 
the response to the album, Dermott went online to read the comments. Dermott was furious, 
claiming Louis Barlow’s comment was a clear criticism of Tulisa. He was also furious with 
the comment by ‘Singing Simon’ and, as it was one of the first, thought it may put people off 
the album and complained. However, several days later the comment was still there, and  
Top Hits! have refused to reveal the identity of ‘Singing Simon’.

to compare the two situations, this does not necessarily mean you have to provide a 
detailed factual account of Campbell. Concentrate on applying the legal principles to Kyle 
and using Campbell to simply support your reasoning.
■ Include numerous references to other cases just to show you know them. If citing them 
adds substance to your argument, then do so; if not then leave them out.

  Question 3
Answer
Dermott requires advice as to the tort of defamation and its application 
to the Internet. This is an important issue as it involves balancing the 
competing interests of protecting one’s reputation with free speech 
and press freedom. The issue is further complicated by the Inter-
net itself which emboldens people through perceived anonymity to 
express their views with reduced inhibition.1 It will be argued that 
Louis’ comment will not be actionable by Dermott personally2 and 
Dermott may struggle to mount a claim against ‘Singing Simon’, who 
may have a defence. The possibility of a claim against the magazine 
is considered if the claim can be established.
Dermott should be advised that there are two forms of defamation: 
libel and slander. Although blogging can be seen to be analogous to 
slander in that it is similar to an oral conversation, it has been held  
to be libel (Nigel Smith v ADFN plc [2008] EWHC 1797). Impor-
tantly, this means that no proof of actual damage is needed.3 How-
ever, under section 1 of the Defamation Act 2013, to block trivial 
claims, the statement must cause, or be likely to cause, serious harm 
to Dermott’s reputation. As will be discussed below,4 it is questionable 
whether either statement will overcome this requirement.
1 This provides some context 
to your answer which you 
can draw on later. It also 
demonstrates that you are 
aware of the human rights 
issues which influence the 
area and the difficulties faced 
by the law.
2 You should already have 
determined when reading the 
question that the comment 
does not refer to Dermott 
personally, but the question 
simply says advise Dermott. 
Therefore, allude to the fact 
that you have seen this now 
and advise him more broadly 
later that Tulisa could bring an 
action for that comment.
3 By stating this you are 
illustrating that you are aware 
of the difference between libel 
and slander without using 
up time fully explaining what 
slander is.
4 Normally you should apply the 
law to the facts as you state it. 
However, when you do not it is 
important to explain that you 
will be doing so later so that 
the marker does not think you 
have forgotten to do it. In this 
question, it may make sense 
to show how the requirement 
is not satisfied in the context 
of the other elements of the 
tort. This is because the facts 
will mean that your reasoning 
applies twice over. Dealing 
with the seriousness point 
later allows you to get into the 
requirements to demonstrate 
your knowledge of those while 
maintaining a structural flow to 
your answer.

262
14  Interests in reputation and private information
Clearly, any statement must refer to Dermott otherwise he has no 
basis to make a claim.5 However, the facts suggest that Louis’ com-
ment is an innuendo inferring that Tulisa is a gold-digger.6 This is 
potentially actionable, but only by Tulisa as it refers to her. As such, 
it also unlikely to overcome the threshold requirement in section 1 
on this basis. While the second comment does not directly refer to 
Dermott,7 as it is a comment on a review about his album then it is 
reasonable that people would believe Dermott is being referred to 
(Morgan v Odhams Press Ltd [1971] 2 All ER 1156).
The next requirement is that the statement is defamatory. The state-
ment must lower the regard in which right-thinking members of 
society hold the claimant (Sim v Stretch [1936] 2 All ER 1237). 
Applying this to ‘Singing Simon’s’ comment, the natural meaning 
which Dermott will seek to apply is that he cannot sing, especially 
high notes. It is unlikely that people will shun Dermott personally, but 
they may avoid his album. Similarly, it could cause people to lower 
the regard that they have for his singing. However, Dermott should be 
advised that the comment could instead be viewed as simple abuse 
which is why it may struggle to satisfy the section 1 threshold.8 Abuse 
can amount to defamation in libel (Berkoff v Burchill [1996] 4 All 
ER 1008), but following the Nigel Smith case it would need to be 
shown that the comment was intended to be taken seriously by casual 
readers, which was held to not often be the case. However, this is a 
comment on an album review by someone who may be a fan. Looking 
at the words ‘I feel so let down’, a casual reader may well take this 
to be a reflection of Dermott’s singing and its impact on his fans, 
particularly in light of any negative tone in the review.9
Finally, the statement must be published to a third party. This was 
satisfied once the comment was posted on the website (Godfrey v 
Demon Internet Ltd [2001] QB 201). Every download of the page 
will be another publication, although only one action will result, and 
Dermott will have one year from the date the comment was uploaded 
5 While it is more common to 
deal with the requirement that 
the statement is defamatory 
first, taking this element first 
allows you to draw a line 
under the comment by Louis, 
as Dermott clearly does not 
satisfy this requirement in 
relation to that comment. 
This leaves you to then 
concentrate on the action in 
which he has more chance of 
succeeding.
6 Include this here, even 
though it relates to a different 
requirement, as it allows you 
to show the marker that you 
picked up on the innuendo 
and allude to your knowledge 
of the law in relation to that. 
Then simply dismiss the 
comment as being actionable 
by Dermott for not referring 
to him.
7 Do not just assume that this 
element is satisfied as the 
comment does not use his 
name.
8 As in relation to the 
comment with Tulisa, it 
is important to expressly 
emphasise that you have 
dealt with this point now so 
that the marker knows that 
you have covered it.
9 Where you have two 
contrasting positions, make 
sure that you take a view on 
which is best, and use the 
facts to show why. Otherwise, 
your answer will not make 
total sense as to why you are 
proceeding with your advice.

263
  Question 3
to bring a claim (s. 8).10 The amount of any damages will be reflected 
by the overall scale of publication (John v MGN Ltd [1997] QB 586).
However, even if all the elements are satisfied, the tortfeasor needs 
identifying as only a pseudonym is provided. As ‘Singing Simon’s’ 
identify has not been revealed by Top Hits! Dermott will need a Nor-
wich Pharmacal order which would require the magazine to reveal the 
blogger’s identity from their registration details. The requirements for 
this were outlined in Mitsui Ltd v Nexen Petroleum UK Ltd [2005] 
EWHC 625. First, Dermott needs to show that he has suffered a 
wrong; this will be satisfied if the elements of defamation are met.11 
Secondly, the order must be needed so as to bring an action against 
the wrongdoer, which is also satisfied, as Dermott only knows the 
tortfeasor as ‘Singing Simon’. Lastly, the magazine will need to be 
shown to be involved in the wrongdoing so as to have facilitated the 
wrong, whilst also being able to provide the information needed to 
bring an action. This latter part is satisfied as the statement appeared 
on their website and all users register their personal details. On similar 
facts, Sheffield Wednesday FC v Hargreaves [2007] EWHC 2375 
acknowledged the privacy concerns of bloggers/posters12 stating that 
courts have discretion not to grant the order where the statement, 
while strictly defamatory, is more trivial in nature. This is an issue for 
Dermott because, as noted previously, the post could be said to sim-
ply be abusive and not serious. If the court does not grant the order 
though, or upon learning of his identity it appears futile to sue him, 
Dermott would have the possibility of suing the magazine instead in 
relation to this statement (Defamation Act 2013, s. 5(3)).13
If granted, the next issue is whether the blogger has any possible 
defence. As the post is a reply to the album review, which invited 
comments, the defence of honest opinion arises. This requires the 
statement to be one of opinion which also includes the basis for the 
opinion (s. 3(2), (3)). The opinion here is that Dermott cannot sing and 
the performance on track 6, in particular, is cited as the basis. The 
opinion then needs to be capable of being held by an honest person 
on the basis of any fact existing at the time it was expressed and is 
assessed objectively. The explanatory notes to the section explain14 
that provided the fact relied on is capable of supporting the belief, it 
can be honestly held; we would need to hear the album to say this 
definitively. However, in theory the fact could support the belief, but if 
the blogger, subjectively, did not honestly hold the belief, the defence 
10 Refer to this so that you 
show that you are aware of 
the practicalities of bringing 
a claim and issues such as 
the limitation period. This 
enables you to demonstrate 
that you have a full range 
of knowledge as to the 
subsidiary issues of the tort 
as well as the fundamental 
requirements.
11 It would be important to 
phrase this along these lines 
if you have indicated some 
doubt as to the defamatory 
nature of the comment 
previously in your answer.
12 While this is relevant to the 
answer, it also shows that 
you are aware of the context 
in which decisions are taken, 
and so it shows that you have 
a broader understanding of 
the area.
13 Although the question 
says to advise Dermott 
regarding a claim against the 
blogger, the facts allude to 
a possible claim against the 
magazine, so do not dismiss 
it, especially as the claim 
against the blogger may fail.
14 Until case law builds up on 
the new defences, make sure 
you draw on what Parliament 
said in relation to what the 
sections mean and require.

264
14  Interests in reputation and private information
would fail (s. 3(5)). This continues the trend of the old common law 
version of the defence whereby the spite of the statement maker is 
irrelevant so as to not be inconsistent with the aim of the defence: to 
protect hard-hitting views.15
In conclusion, Dermott may succeed in a claim against ‘Singing 
Simon’ provided that he can show the statement was likely to cause 
serious harm to his reputation. Naturally Dermott would have to obtain 
‘Singing Simon’s’ identity first. However, owing to the nature of the 
comment and where it was published, it is likely that the claim could 
be successfully defended as honest opinion. If the identity of ‘Singing 
Simon’ was not obtained, Dermott could instead successfully claim 
against the magazine as a website operator that, when notified of the 
content of the post, took no action (s. 5(3)).
15 There is not much that can 
be argued here by way of 
application of the facts, so 
instead demonstrate that you 
understand the theory behind 
the defence by highlighting 
what it is for and how it 
compares to that which it 
replaced.

want. A satisfactory balance is vital so that unfounded claims do not 
ruin lives while giving effect to the notion of a free society through 
the promotion of freedom of expression. In assessing the reformed 
long-standing defences,1 it is argued that while the recent reforms 
provide a balance, it is the potential cost of litigation which causes the 
main hurdle to adequately accommodating both interests.
Defamation is where a person is lowered in the estimation of soci-
ety. As Lord Hoffmann observed in Jameel v Wall Street Journal 
Europe [2006] UKHL 44, it protects the immortal part of oneself, 
one’s soul. Defamation has two forms: libel and slander. Slander is 
transient statements and generally requires proof of financial loss, or 
loss which is capable of financial assessment. However, libel, which 
is a permanent publication, was traditionally actionable per se as the 
permanence meant more people could see it and greater damage 
caused. Regardless of which form it takes, now, for a statement to be 
defamatory, serious harm must be caused or be likely to be caused 
to the reputation (s. 1).
To receive the tort’s protection, certain requirements must be met 
which ensure that a sufficient nexus exists between the statement and 
the claimant to warrant restricting the maker’s free speech.2 First, the 
statement must refer to the claimant. Where reference is direct, there 
will generally be no issue. However, it is sufficient if the reasonable 
person, having knowledge of the circumstances, would understand 
the statement as referring to the claimant (Morgan v Odhams Press 
Ltd [1971] 1 WLR 1239). The statement must then be published, 
which requires communication to a third party, otherwise there is no 
1 The point here is just to give 
your marker an indication of 
what defences you will be 
covering as in an exam it will 
be impossible to adequately 
cover all of them.
2 Rather than just explain the 
elements of the tort, explain 
the purpose of the elements. 
You should consider whether

to show damage.

  Question 4
damage to their reputation. Finally, the statement must be defama-
tory. Fair-minded people within society, as a whole, must think less of 
the claimant (Lewis v Daily Telegraph [1964] AC 234). Protection 
extends also to situations where the ordinary words themselves are 
not defamatory but they contain an innuendo which is damaging. If 
seemingly weighted in favour of the claimant, some balance has been 
restored by section 1 which seeks to eliminate trivial actions. This 
rebalancing is particularly the case in light of Lachaux v Independ-
ent Print Ltd [2016] QB 402 which held that this can no longer be 
presumed and must be proven. This could certainly be said to tip the 
balance away from protecting reputations.3
The primary defence is that the statement is true (s. 2), as damages 
should not be awarded for injuring a false reputation (M’Pherson 
v Daniels (1829) 10 B & C 263).4 Statements are presumed to be 
untrue and the defendant must prove otherwise. This is compliant with 
Article 10 (Jameel v Wall Street Journal Europe [2006] UKHL 44) 
and justified as one should have to substantiate one’s claims.5 How-
ever, allegations can be difficult to prove, particularly when they are 
specific, but provided the statement is proven to be substantially true, 
the defence will hold. Where a statement has distinct imputations, 
provided those which cannot be proven are not shown to seriously 
harm the claimant’s reputation, the defence can still be relied upon 
(s. 2(3)). This is important as the lack of concrete evidence combined 
with the cost of defending an action may deter people from making 
statements which are in fact true.6
The next substantial defence is honest opinion (s. 3), which embodies 
the whole idea of free speech as it protects one’s right to criticise 
another.7 It is a vital defence as the free expression of opinions is 
essential for good debate, which enhances a democratic society, and 
allows the truth to come to light. The new defence has sought to 
retain the essence of the old defence while simplifying and clarifying 
certain elements. However, so that reputations are protected certain 
requirements must be met. The statement must be an opinion and 
the statement containing the opinion must indicate, generally or spe-
cifically, what the basis for it is (s. 3(2), (3)). The latter is important 
in further justifying the defence as readers can make up their own 
minds as to the validity of the opinion if they can see what it is based 
3 While the question focuses 
on the defences, offering 
a comment on the judicial 
interpretation of this part of 
the Act allows you to assess 
the merits of the defences, 
and the balance struck, 
in light of this significant 
change.
4 Although the defence is 
not based in the statute, 
its rationale still lies in the 
judicial reasoning of old cases 
so show your understanding 
by drawing on those to explain 
why the defence exists.
5 The fact that the law 
presumes that one is lying 
requires you, in light of the 
statement in the question, to 
explain the justification for 
such a position, as it would 
seem to tilt the balance in 
favour of the claimant.
6 After stating why the law 
adopts the position it does, it 
is important to evaluate the 
consequences of that position 
and where it leaves the 
balance between the parties.
7 As with truth, as these are 
exceptions to when you can 
injure a reputation, you ought 
to start with the reason for the 
defence and then assess its 
merits against the importance 
of protecting reputations.

on.8 It supports the idea that misguided opinions do less harm than 
assertions of facts. The opinion must be capable of being held by an 
honest person based on a fact existing at the time the opinion was 
expressed, or anything asserted to be a fact in a privileged state-
ment before the opinion was expressed (s. 3(4)). The defence will fail 
where the maker, subjectively, does not honestly hold the opinion. 
This replaces the old bar of malice and is better as it reflects the pur-
pose of the defence while recognising that the benefits the defence 
brings do not materialise if the opinion is not genuine; debate is not 
legitimately being fuelled.
The next substantial defence is that in section 4, publication on a 
matter of public interest. The defence replaces the old form of qual-
ified privilege known as the Reynolds defence, while retaining the 
reportage defence (s. 4(3)),9 and has sought to be simpler by break-
ing the link with privilege altogether in order to give it a stronger 
jurisprudential foundation. Whereas the old defence was based on 
the concept of responsible journalism (even though it applied beyond 
newspapers)10 this does not feature in the new defence. The defence 
requires the statement to, first, be on a matter that is in the public 
interest, and secondly, that the publisher reasonably believed that 
publication was in the public interest. The interesting thing about the 
wording of the requirements is that it suggests that some matters may 
be in the public interest generally, but it is not reasonable to believe it 
is in the public interest to publish them, perhaps due to how the story 
was gathered. When determining the requirements, all of the circum-
stances of the case should be considered and allowance should be 
made for editorial judgement. This should mean that the old factors 
highlighted by Lord Nicholls in Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd 
[2001] 2 AC 127 have a role to play still. While denying the defence 
some certainty as to what is required, it does provide the essential 
flexibility which is needed to ensure the defence can apply to a wide 
array of publications which is why certain factors to consider were 
expressly left out of the final version of the section.11
However, while these defences, and the others within the Act,12 afford 
suitable theoretical protection of free speech, particularly in their 
reformed state, the relative ease in satisfying the requirements for 
8 Make sure that you go 
further in your analysis of 
the defence by assessing 
whether the justification of 
each requirement has merit. 
If not, it could be argued that 
the defence is undermined 
and thus the necessary 
balance is lost. Alternatively, 
if the requirements are not 
rigorous enough, the balance 
is tilted too far from protecting 
reputations.

the Reynolds principles, 
reportage was arguably a 
distinct defence with its own 
operation so it is important 
you show that you are aware 
that it has survived and thus 
understand the full scope of 
the new defence.

law, it is useful to show your 
understanding of the old 
law as you are essentially 
undertaking a comparison of 
the two defences.

the background to the drafting 
of the Act by referring to how 
it could have looked. You can 
then use this knowledge to 
build up your argument as to 
the merit of the section’s final 
wording.

to the main defences, there 
are clearly more and you will

that you do appreciate more

  Question 4
defamation still means that the threat of litigation restricts speech.13 
Indeed, the cost means that the prospect of financial ruin is detrimen-
tal to both parties; damaged reputations may go unchallenged and 
damning information of public importance left unpublished. In light of 
the importance of both competing interests, such a state of affairs in 
unacceptable. Therefore, the cost of the litigation process must now 
be the focus of further reform.14
13 Relate this back to your 
initial discussion on the 
elements; if they are meant 
to act as a hurdle for claims 
but then are too easy to 
overcome, does this mean the 
balance is in the claimant’s 
favour?

sought by the law could be

  Question 5
Answer
An evolutionary process has seen the creation of an action offering 
protection for misuses of private information derive from the equitable 
action of breach of confidence. This has proven controversial as it was 
not initiated by Parliament and has implications for the media and free 
speech. As such, there must have been a clear need for such a devel-
opment and any resultant action must be clear in character and scope 
to validate its existence and chart the path of future development. It is 
argued that the creation of this action was a proportionate response 
to the need to give effect to one’s right to control the dissemination 
of information about oneself and is now appropriately settled as a 
tortious action.
The incorporation of the right to respect for private and family life, 
within Article 8 of the ECHR,1 into English law only means that a citi-
zen has protection from state intrusion. It does not correlate to equiva-
lent common law rights actionable against private citizens; the Human 
Rights Act 1998 (HRA) has no direct horizontal effect.2 Therefore, 
without the assistance of the common law, an individual would have 
no redress against another private person, such as a media outlet, 
who seeks to publicise personal information about them against their 
wishes. The opportunity to provide assistance arose in Wainwright v 
Home Office [2003] UKHL 53; however, it was held that no tort pro-
tecting general invasions of privacy existed and nor was one needed. 
Lord Hoffmann observed that compliance with Article 8 did not require 
a specific action, merely an adequate remedy for infringements. His 
Lordship felt that the common law had the means of doing this and 
where gaps existed, the HRA could fill them.
While a diverse range of torts e.g. trespass, defamation and malicious 
falsehood offered adequate remedies in particular circumstances, 
they do not specifically seek to protect privacy and private information 
and as such they had limitations (as illustrated in Kaye v Robertson 
[1991] FSR 62).3 However, as the HRA operates vertically it cannot 
fill these gaps.
The equitable action for breach of confidence was a more adequate 
means of protection as it was at least concerned with keeping con-
fidential information secret through the imposition of a duty not to 
disclose it.4 While primarily focused on commercial and governmental 
1 The right is often shortened 
to the right for privacy, but 
that it not what it is officially 
called. Demonstrate your 
more precise knowledge of 
the area by spelling it out in 
full. It is also important to 
make sure that you do not get 
confused between referring 
to sections under the Act and 
articles under the European 
Convention on Human Rights 
and so use the appropriate 
label.
2 This is something which 
is often misunderstood, so 
it is vital that you show you 
do know how it operates. 
Remember that it is because 
of this fact that there is a 
need to develop a form of 
horizontal protection.
3 You would not need to get 
into Kaye here; your aim is 
to reinforce what you stated 
above regarding the need for 
an effective action that would 
protect a person’s privacy 
against interference by 
another citizen.
4 As this action gave ‘birth’ to 
the tortious action it should 
play a large part in your 
answer to this question; make 
sure you give some context 
to it and explain why the new 
action was able to be created 
from it. This also then helps 
set up your discussion as to 
why it could not be kept in 
unadapted form for personal 
information.

272
14  Interests in reputation and private information
information, it could cover the situation that occurs in modern privacy 
cases: a third party (the media) receives information from a person 
under a duty of confidence and knowing that disclosure is a breach. 
However, the action was based on the idea of a confidential rela-
tionship between the person whose information it is and the person 
receiving it. In Campbell v MGN Ltd [2004] UKHL 22 Lord Nicholls 
acknowledged, in the types of case coming before the courts, such as 
‘kiss and tell’ stories, talk of duties of confidence and classifying infor-
mation about one’s private life as confidential was not a comfortable 
fit. The idea of a confidential relationship was also being strained by 
how it was being adapted to these situations. If the action was applied 
in situations which were not a natural fit and further away from its 
origins, it risked distortion and falling into disrepute.
Baroness Hale argued in Campbell that although the HRA does not 
mean that new rights can be created to give effect to Convention 
rights, under section 6, as a public authority the court must inter-
pret and develop existing rights in a Convention-compatible manner.5 
This also reflects Lord Hoffmann’s opinion in Wainwright where 
he acknowledged that privacy, while not a principle of law, was an 
underlying value which could point the way for developing existing 
legal principles. As such, in Campbell, breach of confidence was 
developed so that the requirement of a prior confidential relationship 
was removed for these types of cases. Reflecting this, Lord Nicholls 
rechristened the action as the tort of misuse of private information 
to maintain a distinction with breach of confidence which he would 
later hold dealt with a different interest altogether (Douglas v Hello! 
Limited [2008] 1 AC 1) and needed to be kept distinct.
The new terminology was used in McKennit v Ash [2008] QB 73,6 
which reviewed the opinions in Campbell to set out the requirements. 
First, the information in question must be private, thus protected by 
Article 8. This involves assessing whether the claimant had a reason-
able expectation of privacy over the information. In Campbell, Lord 
Hope suggested that this exists where the information is obviously 
private or easily identifiable as such. However, where there was doubt, 
recourse should be had to the ‘highly offensive test’ from Australian 
Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd (2001) 
1 ALR 185. This requires asking what a reasonable person of ordinary 
5 Following your previous 
discussion and how the Act 
works, it is important to get 
across that you are aware of 
this development: otherwise, 
your answer may seem 
contradictory.
6 While the elements of the 
tort originate in Campbell, all 
of the opinions were distilled 
into a simple formulation of 
the test in McKennit so it is 
good to use this case. As it 
is being used for a purpose, 
it also helps you to show you 
are aware of, and understand, 
other significant cases.

273
  Question 5
sensibilities would feel in the claimant’s position. While doubts over 
using this test were expressed by Lord Nicholls, who felt it blurred 
the differing questions of what is private and what interference is 
proportionate, their views are compatible in that it is what the claimant 
objectively thinks which matters – a view shared in Murray v Big 
Pictures (UK) Ltd [2008] EMLR 127 – and leads to more effective 
protection.
If the information is sufficiently private, the second question is whether 
it should remain private or yield to the defendant’s freedom of expres-
sion. While the latter right is essential for a free press operating in a 
democracy, it must be balanced with ensuring responsible behaviour 
and respecting Article 8. As both Articles in question state that each 
right may be restricted where necessary in a democratic society so 
as to give effect to the other, neither takes precedence.
When performing this balancing exercise, Baroness Hale in Camp-
bell stated three factors to consider to ensure that interference with 
either Article is proportionate and necessary. First, there must be a 
pressing social need, which protecting the opposing right provides. 
Secondly, any interference must be proportionate to simply meeting 
that social need. Finally, the reasons advanced for the interference 
must be logical and sufficient to justify it. The party which satisfies 
these most effectively will succeed in the aim of preventing or obtain-
ing publication. This will be warranted as they have demonstrated that 
their interference with the other’s right is necessary to give effect to 
the social need while not being too overbearing.8
That some form of action was needed to protect personal information 
was unarguable as the then law was insufficient. However, due to 
its origins in equity, some cases used equitable terminology even 
after Douglas. While this may not have hampered the courts defin-
ing the scope of the new action, it was at odds with it being a new 
action, with new requirements, not rooted in equity, and it would 
have consequences in terms of procedure as seen in Google Inc. 
and Vidal-Hall & Others [2015] EWCA Civ 311; [2015] 3 WLR 
409. In light of the different interests being protected and how, it is 
clear the action has thrown off its equitable past and is appropriately 
classified as a tort.
7 Naturally, you have to 
evaluate the differing views 
in Campbell, but this then 
gives the impression of a law 
in a state of confusion. By 
referring to what later cases 
have said to round off the 
point, you show your detailed 
knowledge of the leading 
case, while showing how it 
has subsequently been dealt 
with by the courts. It allows 
you to argue the new tort is 
coherent and understood, and 
thus effective. Without it you 
raise questions as to what 
is covered by the action and 
how it operates, which your 
marker would expect you to 
then explore.
8 Outline how the balancing 
exercise works, then give an 
opinion as to what this means 
and how the results flowing 
from the exercise arise. 
Someone’s right will have 
been interfered with and so 
you need to decide whether 
this has been done fairly, 
as this goes to the heart of 
whether the tort is good  
or not.

14  Interests in reputation and private information
Answer
The issue here is whether corporations should be treated differently 
from individuals when it comes to libel and have to prove financial 
damage. This is important as corporations place great value on their 
reputation and they have always been treated equally by the courts. 
However, section 1(2) requires them to now show more harm than 
individuals. It is submitted that it was justifiable to alter the rule for 
trading corporations in order to protect the public interest.
Defamation’s purpose is to protect one’s reputation from harm where 
a statement is published which refers to them and would tend to 
lower their reputation in the minds of right-thinking people. Defa-
mation takes two forms: slander, which is a transitory statement, or 
libel, which is a statement in permanent form. Reflecting the fact that 
this permanence means the statement is more easily disseminated 
and any reputational damage is more durable over time, traditionally 
there has been no requirement in libel to prove the damage did occur. 
This is further justified on the basis of the difficulties of an individual 
establishing that the loss was due to the statement.1
Traditionally this rule applied to all claimants (South Hetton Coal 
Co. Ltd v North-Eastern News Association [1894] 1 QB 133). 
However, the first successful challenge was in Derbyshire County 
Council v Times Newspapers Ltd [1993] AC 534. It was held 
that government institutions could not sue to protect their governing 
reputations as otherwise it was contrary to the public interest. Def-
amation claims could be used to censor criticism. In a democracy, 
governmental bodies should be subject to criticism: otherwise, party 
political systems could not function2 as they are based on trying to 
undermine confidence in your opponent’s competence.
That companies should be able to bring an action that has always 
been acknowledged; what has long been disputed is whether they 
should benefit from the same rules as individuals.3 However, with the 
passing of section 1(2) of the Defamation Act 2013, companies which 
trade for profit must show, as individuals must, that the statement 
complained of has caused, or is likely to cause, serious harm, but 
for them this now means serious financial loss. In doing so, this has 
effectively overturned the decision in Jameel v Wall Street Journal 
1 This is the most important 
part of this paragraph as it 
explains why we have the 
rule. Therefore, focus more 
on this than what defamation 
is, as this will provide the 
foundation upon which the 
actual arguments take place.
2 While this may seem slightly 
off tangent, you should briefly 
cover this case and the 
principle which it determined 
as you can use this later in 
support of Baroness Hale’s 
view when you look at the 
minority view in Jameel.
3 Using this wording here 
gives you the scope to 
seamlessly proceed to 
discussing the majority or 
the minority, depending on 
your viewpoint. Remember 
to lay out the view that you 
ultimately favour second, as 
this will mean your answer 
will end on a stronger note 
and flow into your conclusion.

277
  Question 6
Europe Sprl [2006] UKHL 44 at [26] which only recently held that 
both types of claimant should be treated alike.
In Jameel, Lord Scott opined that a corporation’s reputation is an 
asset of monetary value; this is why many advertise on TV shows 
and sponsor events. Companies try to enhance their reputation by 
association for commercial advantage. However, if their reputation 
suffers, these opportunities are reduced, leading to lost custom and 
ultimately profits. Weir (1972) suggested that as this is financial injury 
it can be proved evidentially, unlike with individuals, and thus should 
be proved.4 At first glance this seems a strong point. Lord Scott, 
though, felt that it was not so simple for companies to prove this loss 
and attribute it to the statement. Trade variations happen for a variety 
of reasons and so it is difficult to show that loss resulted from the 
published statement. Lord Bingham agreed with these sentiments, 
highlighting that a corporation’s reputation also impacts on those 
wanting to work for it. Therefore, reputations should be protected 
by a favourable judicial verdict as this carries more weight than a 
denial by press release. Significantly, Lord Scott also noted that such a 
change would exclude corporations from obtaining interim injunctions.
Lord Hope’s opinion was that the arguments for change could not be 
soundly based in principle as they singled out trading corporations for 
differential treatment from non-trading corporations. The distinction 
was because, as Lord Hope noted, bodies such as charities would 
find it even harder to put a value on their loss, let alone prove it. 
However, this distinction has now been entrenched by the Act and is 
arguably unfair in light of the similar evidential difficulties both types of 
corporation may face and the equal asset value of each’s reputation.
Notwithstanding the Derbyshire CC case holding that there were 
distinctions between public authorities and corporations, Baroness 
Hale felt that, today, the boundary is blurred with multinational cor-
porations wielding enormous power.5 As such, she felt it may well be 
of democratic interest to similarly open such corporations to ‘unin-
hibited criticism’. It is important to reiterate that Baroness Hale was 
not suggesting removing standing from trading corporations. Indeed, 
she did not even advocate that loss must be caused: simply that they 
must prove that the statement was likely to cause them financial loss. 
Reflecting the view of the Faulks Committee on Defamation, this was

a slight modification of the position advanced in Derbyshire CC, and 
is the position adopted by the Act.6
This obviously raises the majority’s contention that proving such loss 
may be difficult. However, this is not necessarily the case. Companies, 
particularly large corporations, will have year-on-year sales figures 
and so can contrast the period following the publication to previous 
years’.7 As companies do now, an assessment of external factors 
could be made in order to determine whether any loss was caused 
by those factors such as bad weather or the holding of national 
events. Furthermore, under section 1(2) concrete evidential proof is 
not required so causative uncertainties will not be detrimental. The 
loss must simply be shown to have been ‘likely’ to be caused by the 
statement. This is easier to do when looking at the size of the claimed 
loss and the nature of the statement in light of other external factors. 
Therefore, on a practical basis there was no need to maintain the rule.
Lord Hoffmann, supporting Baroness Hale,8 somewhat countered Lord 
Hope’s theoretical issues regarding creating distinctions.9 He noted 
and agreed that a company’s reputation is a commercial asset, but 
felt not requiring proof of damage would mean that defamation is at 
odds with other torts such as malicious falsehood. This could be jus-
tifiable in that defamation serves a different purpose. However, Lord 
Hoffmann felt that the justification for not requiring proof by individuals 
is that their reputation is part of their ‘immortal’ self – it is their soul. 
Therefore, it warrants greater protection. However, as a company has 
no soul there was no reason to treat it more favourably in defamation 
than in other torts dealing with harm to commercial assets.
Therefore, while there are strong practical and theoretical difficulties 
in treating trading corporations differently, they are not insurmount-
able. Further, reflecting the new landscape identified by Lord Steyn 
in Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd [2001] 2 AC 127 that the 
starting point should be free speech, they should be overcome.10 To 
favour the protection of a company’s reputation without proof of dam-
age is, in Weir’s view, a ‘grim perversion of values’ and therefore it 
is right that Parliament stepped in and legislated on the basis of the 
minority decision.
6 By highlighting these you 
show some wider knowledge, 
and strengthen the assertion 
that this was a modest 
development of the law with 
wider support.
7 Include some practical 
examples as to how the 
majority’s arguments can be 
rebutted, as these will carry 
more force than a purely 
jurisprudential argument.
8 Obviously, as the House was 
split, it is worth showing your 
knowledge of each judge and 
explaining what side they 
were coming from.
9 As you have just ended the 
previous paragraph with why 
there is no practical reason 
for the rule, it is beneficial 
to highlight that you are now 
addressing the remaining 
arguments advanced by 
the majority. As the answer 
is about supporting the 
legislation by arguing against 
the majority, it is important 
to include Lord Hoffmann’s 
brief views on the issues as 
this allows you to counter 
the theoretical reasons of the 
majority.

a strong note with high-level 
judicial endorsement for your

How this topic may come up in exams
Animals themselves may feature in a number of topics such as negligence, nuisance 
or trespass; however, here we are looking at the specific topic of liability under the 
Animals Act 1971. Although a small area, it can be quite complicated. You will 
need to know the wording of the statute and understand how the words have been 
interpreted by the courts. The Act’s complexity means that you should not discount 
a question on the suitability and effectiveness of the legislation. In terms of problem 
questions, you should make sure that you have also learnt the more fringe provisions 
of the Act in addition to the main duty provisions within section 2.

  Question 1
  Question 1
Hughenden Valley Farm has a designated educational section where people can come and 
see the animals up close and learn about them through talks and demonstrations.
As it was the summer holidays, Jenny took her 12-year-old son, Christian, to visit the farm. 
Christian has brought his pet Old English Sheepdog, Pepper, with him. While she is normally 
a very friendly and playful dog, it was her breeding season and so she had been acting in a 
far more agitated manner and chasing after other animals when out on walks.
Suddenly, one of the farm’s sheep that had been used in a demonstration, Clerk, appeared 
from around the corner and startled Pepper, who started to bark wildly. A farm worker, Harry, 
continued to walk with Clerk past Pepper on the way to her field; however, Pepper broke 
loose from Christian’s grasp and then proceeded to chase after Clerk who had fled in a 
frightened state.
Harry managed to grab Pepper, but she turned and bit deeply into his forearm, allowing her 
to escape his grasp. Fearing for the safety of Clerk, who was backed into a corner by Pepper, 
another employee, Margot, shot Pepper dead. The police were immediately called regarding 
the incident. Harry’s wound from the bite required multiple stitches, which meant he could 
not work for several weeks.
Meanwhile, another sheep from the farm, Percy, was startled by all of the commotion and 
ran off through an open gate out of the farm and on to the highway. From there, Percy  
wandered into an adjacent field owned by John, trampling all of his prize vegetables.  
Furious, John tied Percy up by the side of the road, but still on his land, without food or water 
while he went out for the day. As no one from the farm had been to collect Percy by the next 
day, John hired a van in order to transport Percy back at a cost of £150.
Advise all of the parties as to their potential liability for the actions of the various animals.

  Question 1
Answer
These incidents raise questions regarding the operation of the Animals 
Act 19711 (the Act),2 which imposes strict liability on the keeper of 
animals in certain circumstances. It will be argued that Jenny will be 
liable for Harry’s injuries as the ultimate keeper of Pepper; the farm 
will not be liable for killing Pepper and may, in fact, have a claim for 
any injury suffered by Clerk; however, the farm is likely to be found 
liable to John for the damage caused by Percy, but will be entitled 
to compensation from John for his treatment of Percy while in his 
possession.
In determining liability for Harry’s injury first, Jenny should be advised 
that although Pepper is Christian’s pet, he cannot be liable, as under 
the Act only the ‘keeper’ is liable. Under section 6(3),3 the keeper 
is normally the person who owns, or has possession of, the animal. 
While we are told that Pepper is Christian’s dog and he had hold of 
her lead, suggesting he is the keeper, the Act specifies that where 
this person is under 16 the keeper will be the head of the minor’s 
household. Whilst not told whether Jenny is ‘the head of the house-
hold’,4 as Christian’s mother she is likely to satisfy the Act’s wording 
for the purposes of liability.
The next issue is whether Pepper is classified as dangerous or not, as 
different criteria applies depending on this. Jenny should be advised 
that section 6(2) provides a two-limb definition, providing first that 
a dangerous animal is a species not commonly domesticated in the 
British Isles. A dog is commonly domesticated in Britain and so lia-
bility for Pepper will be determined by section 2(2) which deals with 
non-dangerous animals5 and provides a three-limb test for liability. 
First, the damage must be of a kind which Pepper6 was likely to cause 
unless restrained, or which, if caused, was likely to be severe. This 
is satisfied as a dog can be said to be likely to cause a bite injury 
unless restrained. Even if Jenny were to argue that an Old English 
Sheepdog is less likely to bite in comparison to another subspecies 
of dog, it was held in Curtis v Betts [1990] 1 WLR 459 that dogs 
are dealt with as a general category and not by subspecies. The next 
requirement is that the likelihood of the damage was either down to 
permanent, abnormal characteristics for that species, or due to nor-
mal characteristics which arise in the species at particular times or in 
1 As you have not been told 
specifically what aspect of the 
law under which you need to 
consider their liability, identify 
straight away what area you 
consider it to be. This will 
show the marker that you 
have picked up on the main 
issue of the question.
2 Because this is the only 
legislation that you will 
mention, save yourself 
time in your assessment by 
shortening the Act’s name so 
you do not have to repeat it.
3 As matters within the Act 
are dealt with in whole 
sections of the Act, your level 
of knowledge will look more 
in-depth if you can be specific 
as to which part of the section 
is relevant for the point that 
you are making.
4 Use the wording of the Act 
where you can to demonstrate 
why you are discussing the 
issue and your knowledge 
of it.
5 As the first limb has not 
been satisfied, there is no 
need for you to explore the 
second limb.
6 By expressly referring to

becoming a descriptive 
account of what the Act says 
and builds an impression that 
you are constantly applying 
the law to the scenario.

15  Liability for animals
particular circumstances. Since Mirvahedy v Henley [2003] UKHL 
16, these are deemed alternative reasons for liability. As we are told 
that Pepper has only become agitated due to it being her breeding 
season, the bite could be said to fall under the latter reason and be a 
result of the particular circumstances of the case.7 This is supported 
by the bite occurring when Pepper was being restrained. Finally, for 
liability to be imposed, the keeper needs to have actual knowledge of 
the characteristics. From the facts, it would appear that Jenny would 
have known of these characteristics, particularly as we are concerned 
with dogs biting at particular times, which is not uncommon, and we 
are told that she had a habit of chasing animals at this time. Jenny 
may claim a defence under section 5(2) in that Harry assumed the 
risk of being bitten by trying to restrain Pepper. While possible, Harry’s 
position is arguably akin to that of a rescuer and so the defence may 
fail. Compensation may be reduced though on the basis of contribu-
tory negligence on his part, but more facts would be needed.8 
The next issue is the killing of Pepper. As we are specifically told that 
Margot is a farm employee, and it would seem clear that she was 
acting in the course of her employment as she was seeking to prevent 
Pepper attacking Clerk, Jenny should be advised that any potential 
claim could be brought against the farm owner under the doctrine of 
vicarious liability. Normally, any claim would arise under trespass to 
goods and would seem straightforward on the facts; however, under 
section 11 a sheep is classified as livestock and section 9 of the Act 
provides a defence if the farm can show that Pepper was killed while 
protecting their livestock.9 Section 9(3) stipulates when a person will 
be deemed to be protecting livestock and crucially here, Paragraph (a) 
states that this will be where a dog is worrying livestock, and there is 
no other means of ending the worry. It is clear that Pepper was still 
worrying Clerk at the relevant time as she had already chased her into 
a corner. Jenny should be advised that as Harry had already tried to 
restrain Pepper and was bitten, an argument that the worrying could 
have been ended by some other means is unlikely to succeed. Margot 
could, therefore, legitimately claim that there was no other means 
of protecting Clerk. The farm’s position is strengthened by section 
9(4) which provides the defence will be satisfied if Margot reasonably 
believed Pepper to be worrying Clerk. As the police were immediately 
called the defence will not be lost under section 9(1)(b) which gives 
7 You should always draw on 
the facts of the question to 
support your thinking, but 
it is even more important 
when there is no clear-cut 
answer as it lends support to 
a proposition when it may not 
be otherwise apparent what 
the basis for it is.
8 There is nothing in the 
question to definitively 
support this, so do not state 
the possibility too strongly, 
but at the same time, do 
not ignore the possibility. 
Highlight that you are alert to 
the possibility; request more 
information and move on. 
It will nicely round off your 
answer on this point.
9 You need to mention this 
first as the defence is only for 
the protection of livestock. 
Therefore, if Clerk is not 
livestock, the matter is closed 
and the farm would be liable 
for Pepper’s death.

287
  Question 1
48 hours for this to happen. Jenny should also be advised that if Clerk 
has suffered any injury as a result of being chased by Pepper, then the 
farm would have an action for this injury under section 3 of the Act.10 
The final issue is that regarding Percy’s escape. First, in relation 
to the farm’s potential liability for the damage caused by Percy to 
John’s vegetables.11 As another sheep, Percy is livestock and as he 
has strayed from the farm’s land and caused damage to John’s land, 
they will be strictly liable for the extent of that damage under section 
4. Even though Percy strayed onto the land from the highway, the 
farm will not have a defence under section 5(5) as Percy was not 
lawfully on the highway in the first place. The farm should be advised 
that even if Percy was only able to enter John’s land because it was 
unfenced, it would not be considered John’s fault unless John had 
a duty to fence. John would also be able to recover the expense of 
transporting Percy back to the farm under section 4(1)(b) provided 
this was reasonably incurred which it seems to have been. However, 
John should be advised that while he had the right to detain Percy 
under section 7, the farm would have a counterclaim against him 
under section 7(6) if Percy suffered damage through his failure to 
supply any food or water.
To conclude, it appears that Jenny would have no redress for Pepper’s 
death and, in fact, may well be liable for claims under the Act by 
Harry, and by the farm for any harm suffered by Clerk. John would 
have a valid claim against the farm, but may have to compensate 
them if Percy suffered an injury whilst detained by him.
10 Although we are not told 
of this, you should raise it to 
show your knowledge as it is 
potentially an issue; simply 
indicate what the position is 
either way.
11 As this involves two 
different provisions of the Act 
separate them out clearly and 
deal with each in the order 
that they occur.

■ Consider the possibility of liability at common law under, for example, trespass or 
negligence, even if only to confirm the Animals Act 1971 as the best option to use.
■ Illustrate your knowledge of the wider law by discussing how even if the farm did not

  Question 2
‘If section 2(1) can be said to be drafted with commendable simplicity, the same cannot be 
said for section 2(2). The drafting, which has attracted four decades of judicial and academic 
criticism, is grotesque.’ (Per Maurice Kay LJ in Turnbull v Warrener [2012] EWCA Civ 412 
at [4])
Critically evaluate how case law has approached the issue of interpreting section 2(2) of the 
Animals Act 1971 and assess the extent to which the matter has been resolved.
Don’t be tempted to . . . 
■ Discuss common law tort options at the expense of liability under the Act. The facts 
taken as a whole allude to all the different aspects of potential liability under the 
legislation so focus on that first to be sure to cover it fully.
■ Get too bogged down in the debate around the meaning of section 2(2) from cases such 
as Cummings v Grainger [1977] QB 397 and Breeden v Lampard (unreported).
■ Explore in detail defences that, on the facts, clearly will fail, such as that within section 
5(5). Simply show that you are aware the facts are looking for you to show you know, 
but show your understanding by quickly dismissing it from being applicable. Similarly, 
avoid trying to demonstrate greater depth of knowledge as to what John could have done 
under section 7 as he does return Percy the next day rather than keeping him.
■ State as definite certain facts, or presume their non-existence, just because the question 
is silent on the matter: for example, whether the farm has a claim under section 3 of 
the Act.
■ Illustrate your understanding of the doctrine of vicarious liability by going into more depth 
if you feel that you will have the time.
■ Be precise with the provisions that you refer to by indicating the subsections of the Act. 
This will show that you have a much stronger level of knowledge of the Act.

➜ Outline the overall purpose of the legislation and the specific purpose of section 2(2).
➜ Analyse the provisions of the subsection and explain what the requirements for liability are.
➜ Evaluate the differing approaches to interpreting the section by the Court of Appeal prior to

The issue to consider is how the courts have approached the matter 
of interpreting the section in light of the issues with how it is drafted 
and the extent that clarification has been achieved. The case of 
Mirvahedy v Henley [2003] UKHL 13 is significant as the law was in 
a state of uncertainty due to contrasting views in previous authorities 
as to the appropriate interpretation of the subsection. It is argued that 
the case has resolved the difficulties by clarifying the law, and despite 
some concerns regarding the decision, the law is now in a settled and 
satisfactory state.

15  Liability for animals
Liability for animals under the common law was described by Lord 
Nicholls1 in Mirvahedy as ‘notoriously intricate and complicated’. The 
Animals Act 1971 sought simplification, but the language employed 
in section 2(2) caused complexity and uncertainty. Section 2(2) deals 
with liability for injury by all non-dangerous animals. This phrase, 
owing to section 6,2 captures all animals which are commonly domes-
ticated in Britain regardless of whether certain subspecies may be 
more dangerous than others: for example, Rottweilers compared to 
Labradors. The fact that the subsection is to be applied in such a vast 
range of scenarios heightens the need for clear wording and a solution 
to the previous lack of clarity which had caused problems.
The subsection has three requirements which must be satisfied in 
order for liability to be imposed. Two requirements, Paragraphs (a) 
and (c), have been successful in simplifying matters. Paragraph (a) 
provides that the damage must be of a kind which the animal is 
likely to cause unless restrained, or which if caused is likely to be 
severe. Paragraph (c) requires that the characteristics of the animal 
which cause the injury be known to the keeper, their servant or a 
member of their household who is under 16. The key requirement 
is Paragraph (b).3 
This links to Paragraph (a) by providing that the likelihood of damage 
or the likelihood of it being severe must be due to the characteristics 
of the animal. The difficulty regarded what the requirement meant, 
and the nature of the characteristics in question, as the requirement 
clearly has two limbs. The paragraph states that the cause must be 
a permanent characteristic of the animal which is abnormal for that 
species, ‘or’ the cause was a characteristic which ‘is not normally so 
found except at particular times or in particular circumstances’.4 The 
purpose of this paragraph,5 according to Lord Nicholls in Mirvahedy, 
is to limit the circumstances when liability will be imposed by providing 
a precondition of liability in addition to (a) and (c). However, it has 
been held that the wording is ‘inept’ (per Nourse LJ in Curtis v Betts 
[1990] 1 WLR 459) and has an ‘elusive’ meaning (per Lloyd LJ in 
Breeden v Lampard (unreported) 21 March 1985).6 It is the second 
limb which has caused difficulty, with contrasting judicial opinions 
over whether it was an alternative head for imposing liability, or merely 
a clarification of the first limb. Clarity was hindered by the fact that 
the cases forming both sides of the debate were not before the court 
in the opposing cases.7 
1 By quoting passages from 
specific judges in the case, 
you will show a deeper level 
of knowledge of the case.
2 Although the question is 
concerned with section 2(2), 
you still need to discuss what 
is said by section 6 as this 
dictates what animals are 
governed by section 2(2).
3 As this is the paragraph 
of the subsection at the 
root of the problems, this 
should form the main part of 
your answer, so you should 
just briefly outline what 
Paragraphs (a) and (c) state.
4 As you will highlight in your 
answer, this phrase is not 
clear and could be worded 
better. However, by using the 
actual statutory wording, you 
illustrate why there have been 
difficulties and set up your 
later discussion.
5 To fully assess the correct 
interpretation of the 
paragraph, you ought to 
explain what the purpose 
of it is. Then you can use 
this purpose as a basis for 
assessing each interpretation.
6 As these two judgments form 
the opposing schools of thought 
as to how the section operates, 
by quoting their criticisms you 
will reinforce the idea that there 
were widespread difficulties 
with the section.
7 Don’t just highlight that you 
know the problem, try to show 
that you understand why the 
problem came about.

291
  Question 2
The first interpretation comes from Cummings v Grainger [1977] 
QB 397, which concerned a guard dog biting a trespasser. It was held 
that, while dogs are not normally prone to bite, when they are guard-
ing their territory they may do. Therefore, while this was considered 
normal behaviour in the circumstances, were it not for a valid defence, 
liability would have arisen. The merits of such view are that it falls 
within a literal interpretation of the statute.8 The use of the word ‘or’ 
would indicate that this is an alternative to the first limb. The diffi-
culty with this interpretation is the generality of the meaning it gives. 
It results in liability always arising, as one would always be able to 
point to a set of circumstances and say that they are particular to that 
species. Liability would be imposed even though the behaviour was 
normal, such as a bitch biting someone who approaches her pups.9 
Breeden provides the second interpretation. A characteristic was 
said to not warrant being classified as abnormal, and thus subject to 
strict liability, when it was normal for the animal in those particular 
circumstances. Therefore, the scenario of a bitch protecting her pups 
would not bring liability as that is a characteristic which is normal 
in that scenario. Imposing liability in the view of Lloyd LJ would not 
have any sense as the second limb of the paragraph was merely 
refining the meaning of abnormality. Oliver LJ agreed that Parliament 
could not have intended to impose liability for actions which were 
normal in the animal in the circumstances in question. These views 
have force as otherwise a non-dangerous animal is being treated 
the same as a dangerous animal; as the Act makes the distinction, 
it would seem strange to then treat them alike. Therefore, in contrast 
to the Cummings interpretation, the Breeden interpretation would 
essentially never result in liability. Negligence could perhaps be relied 
on though instead.
The issue in Mirvahedy was whether a keeper is liable for damage 
caused in circumstances when the animal’s behaviour was normal for 
the animal in question in the particular circumstances of the case. 
Lord Nicholls felt that neither interpretation ‘provides a compelling 
clear solution’, but there was nothing in the section’s wording to sup-
port the Breeden interpretation. Adopting it would depart from the 
scheme originally advanced by the Law Commission, without any 
evidence to suggest that Parliament intended such a departure. Lord 
Walker acknowledged that the distinction made as to the danger-
ousness of the animal implied that strict liability can never arise for 
8 As you are assessing and 
contrasting two opposing 
interpretations, offer a view 
as to the merits or otherwise 
of each interpretation. If you 
do not, your answer will be 
lacking in terms of analysis of 
the section, which is what you 
have been asked to do.
9 This is a general example 
which the cases use to simply 
illustrate the issue to be 
determined.

15  Liability for animals
a non-dangerous animal which is behaving entirely normal, as their 
behaviour would have to be abnormal. However, he also noted that 
this implication was not clearly spelt out and as such the language 
of the Act suited the Cummings interpretation ‘more naturally’ as a 
matter of language.
In conclusion, the fact that two judges dissented in Mirvahedy and 
subsequent cases have favoured them highlights that some problems 
remain. However, the case does resolve previous problems of conflict-
ing interpretations and so gives clarification to the matter. The literal 
wording of the section supports the Cummings interpretation. The 
use of ‘or’ is critical to defeating the reasoning in Breeden that the 
second limb is a refinement of the first. Without anything to support 
a counter purpose to the section, the adoption of the literal rule for 
statutory interpretation must be undertaken. Fears that liability would 
now always result caused a vast increase in animal insurance pre-
miums, leading many riding schools to close. However, these fears 
have proved unfounded, with subsequent cases not finding liability.10 
However, perhaps the only solution to definitively settle the matter is 
for new legislation.
10 If you highlight this, it 
helps to illustrate whether 
the case was right or wrong. 
Depending on your view, put 
these in the order that you 
think helps the point you are 
making.
Make your answer stand out
■ Draw on more of the background to the Act, such as the Law Commission (1967) report, 
to more fully support what the purpose of the section was.
■ Incorporate the dissenting opinions of Lord Slynn and Lord Scott as to why Mirvahedy v 
Henley [2003] UKHL 13 should have been decided differently.
■ Explore the cases following Mirvahedy v Henley [2003] UKHL 13, particularly Turnbull v 
Warrener [2012] EWCA Civ 412, to consider in more depth the merits of the different 
approaches in Mirvahedy and the extent that the law could be said to be settled.
■ Supplement your answer with academic opinion on the discussion arising in Mirvahedy v 
Henley [2003] UKHL 13, such as Howarth, D. (2003) The House of Lords and the  
Animals Act: closing the stable door. Cambridge Law Journal, 62(3): 548–51.
■ Consider how reform may look if you consider the matter has not been settled.

293
  Question 2
Don’t be tempted to . . . 
■ Give specific detail as to the rules of statutory interpretation.
■ Discuss the other provisions of the Act in order to show that you have knowledge of 
them; the question is specific to section 2(2) and the particular difficulties that that has 
caused.
Try it yourself
Now take a look at the question below and attempt to answer it. You can check your 
response against the answer guidance available on the companion website  
(www.pearsoned.co.uk/lawexpressqa).
Hosni runs the Al-Saleh Circus that is famous for its acts involving camels. To 
announce that the circus was in town Hosni decided to parade some of his 
camels through the High Street and offer rides to local children. However, during 
the parade a car which had parked nearby backfired as the engine was started. 
The loud bang caused one of the camels, Koussa, to become frightened and run 
off. At the time Koussa was giving a ride to William who subsequently fell off and 
broke his hip.
The parade was being watched by Barack who had his pet dog, Nicholas, with 
him. Nicholas is a poodle and has a tendency to get overexcited and bite people 
when there is a lot of noise. The resulting noise and commotion caused Nicholas 
to react in this way and he turned around and bit Muammar severely on the leg.
Advise Hosni and Barack on the respective potential liability under the Animals  
Act 1971.
