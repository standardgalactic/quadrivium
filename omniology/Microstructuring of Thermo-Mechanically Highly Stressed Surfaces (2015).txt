Preamble 
Preamble 
 
The fuel consumption of a modern combustion engine is one of the most important 
purchase criteria in contemporary society. Increasing oil prices and exhaust emis-
sions taxes force the automotive industry to continuously improve the vehicle en-
gines. The fuel consumption is closely related to the frictional losses of an engine. 
New material pairings or constructive modifications of the piston group can reduce 
such losses. Another innovative concept to lower the frictional forces is the micro-
structuring of thermo-mechanically highly stressed surfaces. Within an interdiscipli-
nary research group sponsored by the German Research Foundation, scientists at 
the Leibniz Universität Hannover and Universität Kassel have been working together 
to investigate this research topic. This final report presents their findings and offers 
scope for further discussion.

Introduction 
More than 51 million vehicles with an annual total mileage of about 699 billion kilome-
tres are registered in Germany [DES12, UMW12]. Assuming an average consump-
tion of 7.5 l per 100 km, a reduction in fuel consumption of 1% to 3% would lead to 
savings of 524 to 1,573 million litres of fuel [UMW12]. Efforts to reduce fuel consump-
tion encompass a variety of measures, from reducing the vehicle weight to increasing 
its power density, nominal speed and maximum mean effective pressure. Power 
densities of contemporary diesel and gasoline engine designs range from 30 kW/dm3 
to 105 kW/dm3 for charged gasoline engines [SCH11]. However, an increase in the 
specific power density is accompanied by an increase in the thermo-mechanical 
stress of the piston group (piston, piston rings and liner): Higher blow-by losses, wear 
as well as entry of oil into the combustion chamber are the undesirable side effects. 
In this connection, the piston group is responsible for up to 50% of the total mechani-
cal losses of an engine, in particular for higher specific loads [DEU10]. As a reaction 
towards these continuously increasing thermo-mechanical stresses, various ap-
proaches to tribological optimisation of surfaces have already been pursued, espe-
cially in the area of cylinder liners. In addition to specific material systems and honing 
methods, micro-dimples cut into a surface have been providing, for some time now, a 
viable alternative approach to improve friction and wear properties as well as to re-
duce oil consumption. 
The effect and the tribological potential of such microstructures were fundamentally 
investigated within the interdisciplinary DFG research group 576. Based on a wide 
range of experiences, the primary objective was to make the tribological behaviour of 
thermo-mechanically highly stressed surfaces far superior to conventional surfaces 
by a distinct creation of microstructures. During the six-year duration of the project 
(2006 to 2012), scientists at the Leibniz Universität Hannover and the Universität 
Kassel from the disciplines of tribology, production and measurement technology 
worked closely together (see Figure 1-1). Their collaboration provided fundamental 
insights concerning the simulation-based design of stochastically and deterministical-
ly structured surfaces (subproject 1). Stochastic surface structuring was realised by 
porous, thermally sprayed coatings, whereas deterministic surface structuring by the 
cutting of micro-dimples into a surface (subprojects 2 and 3). Innovative optical 
measuring strategies were developed to measure the produced microstructures 
(subproject 4). Based on extensive experiments, the tribological potential of micro-
structures for different contact conditions, load collectives, and demonstrators  were 
investigated, and the tribological correlations were systematically elaborated (subpro-
jects 1, 2 and 3). Furthermore, a transfer of the research results in an industrial appli-
cation was realised by the microstructuring of industrially manufactured cylinder lin-
ers. The experimental investigation of those machined liners was carried out on a 
heavy duty diesel single cylinder test engine (subproject 5).

2.2 Starting situation and need for action 
Combustion engines are widely distributed in the world and, barring an unforeseen 
development, will maintain their dominant position in the near and middle future, as 
alternative mobility concepts like electric cars cannot compete with the power density 
of conventional combustion engines. In some fields of transport industry, as for ex-
ample long-haul trucks or container ships, electrification does not seem feasible at 
all. When designing combustion engines, the main focus is laid on efficiency, since it 
is directly related to specific fuel consumption as well as to CO2 emissions. This is 
reflected by continuously stricter exhaust-gas limits and taxation regulations, which 
take into consideration the amount of CO2 emissions as well as the planned obligato-
ry fleet consumption of 120 g CO2 per km. 
Since up to 50 % of the mechanical losses are related to the piston group depending 
on the operating point, their reduction represents one of the most effective means for 
reducing the total friction in combustion engines. The tribological functional properties 
of components sliding against each other are determined by load, relative speed, ma-
terial combination, and to a significant extent, by their surface properties as well. 
Thus, performance and lifetime of such tribological systems can be improved by op-
timising the surface topography. For this reason, cylinder liners are generally honed 
which ensures not only their high shape accuracy but also the characteristic criss-
crossing groove microstructure on the surface. As a result, oil retention volume and 
properties can be adjusted by means of the surface roughness and the crossing an-
gle of the grinding grooves. In general, the aim is to achieve high load capacities and 
thus favourable sliding properties via low roughness and high contact ratios. Fur-
thermore, a certain minimum roughness is required for the oil retention. However, the 
criss-crossing groove structure, developing on the surface, is a communicating sys-
tem where the lubricant is not only evenly distributed but is also displaced by the slid-
ing partner. This is a disadvantage especially for low sliding speeds, such as those 
typical for the dead centre area (top dead centre), with regard to the development 
and the maintenance of hydrodynamic lubrication conditions [FLO85].  
Here, micro-dimples cut into cylinder liners have been providing, for some time now, 
a promising approach to improve friction and wear properties as well as to reduce oil 
consumption. Figure 2-1 shows the friction force for one cycle for a normally honed 
as well as for a finely honed and additionally laser-structured cylinder liner as pub-
lished by one of the partner institutes of this research group in 2004. It can be seen 
that friction forces can be significantly reduced by the creation of micro-dimples, es-
pecially in mixed friction areas [TOM08, GOL04, HEU07].

Figure 2-1: Reduction of the friction losses at the piston group by laser-structured cylinder liners 
[GOL04]  
By combining a low basic roughness and the hydrodynamic pressure increasing ef-
fect of laser dimples, a reduced piston group friction of up to 53% during fired opera-
tion could already be reached. The simultaneous reduction in oil consumption of 70% 
to 85% can be explained by the lower basic roughness and the smaller oil retention 
volume of the cylinder liners [ABE06]. The creation of micro-dimples in piston rings 
can result in a reduction in fuel consumption of up to 4% [ETS09]. In the field of thrust 
bearing technology, surface structures and micro-dimples also show a great potential 
to minimise friction, as demonstrated by several research papers on analogue com-
ponents [ETS99a, ETS99b, WAN03]. 
However, previous findings concerning the tribological functioning of microstructured 
surfaces are mostly based on particular test series, random tests and idealised con-
tact geometries. As a consequence, only limited methods and tribological models for 
an application-oriented, and thus load-specific, design of such surfaces are available. 
Therefore, it is difficult to transfer existing knowledge and methods to other tribologi-
cal contact and load conditions. To obtain essential knowledge of microstructures, 
which would allow their usage in a wide range of applications, fundamental experi-
ences based on extensive, systematic theoretical as well as experimental test series 
have to be gained, thus ensuring perfect transferability.  
In recent years, laser machining as a microstructuring method has been further de-
veloped [ETS05, SIE09]. When creating geometrically defined micro-dimples within 
minimum tolerances, the rather high productivity of this method decreases immensely 
due to low removal rates. Furthermore, laser-structured surfaces need refinishing in 
order to remove melt protrusions [ABE06]. In many fields, the high equipment costs 
pose a serious obstacle to the use of this technology. Additional methods, which 
could be used to create micro-dimples, are micro-spark erosion [GRU97, MAS89, 
UHL06], micro-forming [HIR07, KLO07, PET05] or electrochemical machining 
[COS09, STÖ08]. Nevertheless, small workpiece surfaces, necessary refinishing as 
well as difficult integration into the existing process chains remain a challenge for the 
large-scale industrial application of these methods onto cylinder liners.

Project overview 
Cutting processes already show a multitude of innovative approaches for microstruc-
turing of surfaces. Common cutting processes, such as turning, milling or grinding, 
can be scaled down for the microstructuring process. Due to the high flexibility of 
these processes, various structures can be machined on the workpiece surface. The 
use of mono crystalline diamond tools, in particular, allows the creation of minuscule 
structure dimensions with high aspect ratios, geometry and surface qualities [BRE04, 
BRI07]. However, diamond cutting is primarily suited for the machining of non-ferrous 
materials [GLA04]. Thus, it cannot be used for cutting of micro-dimples into cylinder 
liners, which are generally made of ferrous materials. Furthermore, the small cutting 
thickness which results from the application of diamond cutting tools limits the sur-
face capacity. Consequently, no cutting processes are suitable for cutting geometri-
cally defined micro-dimples with high reliability and accuracy into large tribologically 
stressed surfaces. 
Another effective approach to a tribological functionalisation of thermo-mechanically 
highly stressed surfaces is the coating with friction-reducing, wear-resistant coats. 
These coating systems are already used in the field of diesel engines, showing great 
tribological potential. It has been proposed that the possible elimination of cast iron 
cylinder liners could lead to a considerable reduction in weight, and thus reduce the 
"blow-by", because there would be no distortion of the cast iron liner and the alumi-
num motor engine [FLO11]. Thereby, the use of specifically produced porosities 
which exhibit positive effect on friction, wear and oil retention is of a special interest 
because they can act as micro-dimples [HOL11, BAR05]. Moreover, a major focus 
was put on the investigation of molybdenum spray materials since using molybdenum 
as a coating material has been shown to improve friction and wear properties 
[OVE79]. However, systematic knowledge concerning the load-specific tribological 
design and manufacturing of such coatings does not exist as of yet. [FLO03]. 
In order to evaluate the tribological functioning of microstructures, their arrangement 
and geometry must be known. For this purpose, parameters for their characterisation, 
but also methods to identify them quantitatively, are required. Small dimensions as 
well as highly-complex geometries of microstructures (pores, steep flank angles) and 
components (bores) pose a major challenge to measurement technology. Conse-
quently, measuring methods for an extensive automated characterisation of struc-
tured surfaces are still in development. Furthermore, a certain lack of meaningful pa-
rameters which can be used for the evaluation of the changes of the tribological be-
haviour of structured surfaces has been identified [DON95].  
The characterisation of surface roughness is currently based on tactile measure-
ments [VOL05, WEI06, BIC12], but tactile measurements of large lateral dimensions 
require long measurement times and, by the nature of the technique, risk damaging 
the tested surface. Moreover, the accuracy of the measurements is limited for surfac-
es with high aspect ratios caused by morphological filtering of the stylus [STO93, 
KRY04]. Using optical measurement devices for point measurements, such as confo-
cal chromatic sensors, provides a less time-consuming alternative without the risk of

inflicting damage to the workpiece [BRO04]. For this reason, optical measurement 
techniques are frequently used for the characterisation of surfaces in industrial pro-
jects [SCH07, OFE07]. Hence, norm texts, such as the EN ISO 25178, regulating the 
application of optical surface measurements are currently being designed and are to 
be published in the near future. Additionally, 3D surface data obtained by optical 
measurements can be analysed with methods of image processing to extract the sur-
face structures relevant for the further research of their tribological effect [BOD98, 
STO93, WEI06]. Using chromatic sensors, for example, is suitable for large slopes, 
as it exhibits a lateral resolution of 1 μm and a vertical uncertainty of about 100 nm in 
a measuring range of 500 μm. By integrating a chromatic sensor within a coordinate 
measuring machine, it is possible to measure large surface fields with a minimised 
uncertainty.  
2.3 Summary of main results 
The wide-ranging expertise of the research group was reflected in the five subpro-
jects. In the first subproject, numerical simulation tools (KORI3D / PRO) were en-
hanced in order to calculate the tribological properties of microstructures. Using a 
Lattice-Boltzmann model to describe the physical properties of the engine oil inside 
the microstructures, a new approach was developed. Through the novel simulation 
technique, it was possible to determine the ideal layout of the microstructures. This 
knowledge was used as an input for the manufacturing processes and for further lay-
out developments within the tribological experiments (see chapter 3). 
Two different approaches regarding the manufacturing of microstructures were uti-
lised. In the first stage, a machining process that uses an axially parallel turn-milling 
strategy was developed. By adjusting the feed rate and the rotational frequencies, 
various micro-dimple arrangements could be machined continuously. Typical dimen-
sions varied from 1 mm to 2 mm in length, 50 μm to 100 μm in width and 5 μm to 
30 μm in depth. To investigate the basic correlations between process variables, 
quality characteristics and chip formation mechanisms, fly-cutting tests were carried 
out (see chapter 4). Subsequently, a thermal spray process that allows the manufac-
turing of coatings with a defined porosity was developed. The microstructures were 
formed by the porosity of non-molten and re-solidified spray particles (see chapter 5).  
In the next sub-project, optical sensors were developed in order to characterize the 
technical surfaces. A white light interferometer was used to measure small surface 
excerpts with high resolution. A coordinate measuring machine was modified with a 
confocal chromatic sensor in order to allow in-cylinder-measurements. Furthermore, 
data processing methods and optimised image alignment techniques were developed 
to ensure high resolution images of the microstructures (see chapter 6). 
The tribological mechanism of machined and thermally sprayed microstructures was 
analysed by means of tribometer testings and a test rig specially designed for the cyl-
inder liners (see chapter 7). During the testing, the creation of machined micro-

8 
Project overview 
dimples led to the reduction of the minimum friction coefficient by up to 79% as well 
as to its shift towards lower relative speeds by 77%. The identified effects indicate 
that machined micro-dimples support hydrodynamic pressure build-up between the 
friction partners under planar contact conditions (see chapter 7.1). When testing 
thermally sprayed microstructures, coated surfaces consistently exhibited enhanced 
frictional properties compared to those of uncoated steel or cast iron. In comparison 
with the reference samples, the coatings provide the potential of using the micro-
structures to build a hydrodynamic pressure and additionally use the microstructures 
as an oil retention capacity. Due to the lamellar structure of the coatings, a new mi-
crostructured surface with the same properties is exposed after wear (see chapter 0). 
An experimental analysis of a microstructured cylinder liner was carried out on a sin-
gle cylinder heavy-duty research engine under fired conditions. The friction, in terms

vanced mass spectroscopy system. The surfaces of the investigated cylinder liner 
were plateau honed, fine honed with machined micro-dimples and coated by thermal 
spraying. Depending on the micro-dimple arrangement, cylinder liners with machined 
microstructures showed a decrease of FMEP by a maximum of 19 % and significantly 
less oil consumption at low and medium engine loads compared to an ordinary plat-
eau honed liner (see chapter 8).

3.1 Objective and approach  
The objective of this sub-project was the development and validation of simulation 
methods for the tribological characterisation of the effect of hydrodynamic micro-
dimples with respect to improved friction wear and oil consumption in the system pis-
ton ring/cylinder liner. 
The influence of dimple cross section geometry, depth and placement of micro-
dimples relative to each other as well as the influence of the ratio of lubricant gap to 
dimple depth on load capacity were investigated. In a first survey, a comparison be-
tween the solution of the Reynolds equation and a full solution of the Navier-Stokes 
equations is presented. 
To transfer the insights gained from the model simulations onto the application piston 
ring ± cylinder linerWKH3DWLUDQG&KHQJ¶VDYHUDJHIORZPRGHOZDVHPSOR\HG)RUWKLV
purpose, the influence of the micro-dimples on pressure and friction was determined 
in a flow simulation with a solution of the Reynolds equation for a representative sur-
face section. 
The principal values of the (shear- and pressure) flow tensors were determined with 
the help of the simulation software FLOSIM, developed at IMK, and stored in lookup 
tables as a function of the average oil film thickness for use in piston ring/cylinder lin-
er and oil consumption simulations.  
Piston ring friction was determined using the software KORI3D, which calculates pis-
ton ring motion relative to ring groove and cylinder liner under inner and outer load-
ing. Basis for this is a multibody system dynamics formulation for the ring pack cou-
pled with relevant system interactions, which include gas dynamics, inertia forces, 
and traction forces in the lubricant, which reflect the flow tensors determined with 
FLOSIM. 
Oil consumption was determined with the software PRO. In this simulation, oil evapo-
ration is determined on the basis of wall temperatures from the solution of the un-
steady Fourier equation in the domain between cooling water, cylinder liner and oil 
film. PRO builds on results which were previously determined with FLOSIM. 
3.2 
Comparison between Computational Fluid Dynamics and the Reynolds 
equation 
This chapter aims to compare the results from the lubrication theory to those ob-
tained with the full Navier-Stokes equations as well as to characterise the differences 
which were found. This comparison was conducted on a model problem with a single 
dimple with different dimple depths. The obtained insights served as a basis for the 
decisions necessary in order to modify the average flow model accordingly.

Methods and models for the design of microstructures 
The Reynolds equation of lubrication theory is derived from the full set of Navier- 
Stokes equations under a number of simplifying assumptions. An important subtask 
of the project consisted in establishing a quantitative measure for the deviation be-
tween solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations and the Reynolds equation. 
To this purpose, a 2-dimensional model with a constant gap between both sliding sur-
faces (constant gap length l and height h), dimple width b and bounding surface ve-
locity v was applied to a number of different dimple depths which were used in the 
solutions of both sets of equations. Lubricant pressures at inlet and exit were set to 
zero (relative to the ambient pressure) as a boundary condition. The pressure equa-
tion could be solved under the Sommerfeld cavitation condition, which allows nega-
tive pressures 
While the Sommerfeld cavitation condition is considered physically incorrect repre-
sentation of cavitation itself, it is well suited for a relative comparison because cavita-
tion models, which are different in the Reynolds equation (e.g., Kumar-Booker) and 
the Navier Stokes equation (e.g., Raleigh-Plesset), do not need to be fed with pa-
rameters.  
Figure 3-1 shows exemplary results for the pressure distributions for shallow (h/t=0,5) 
and deep (h/t=0,067) dimples. It can be seen that the solution of the Reynolds equa-
tion for shallow dimples matches the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations well, 
justifying the assumptions behind the lubrication theory. 
As the dimples become deeper, the difference between the solutions becomes in-
creasingly prominent (h/t=0,067). Thus, in the transition zone between gap and dim-
ple, the pressure calculated from the Reynolds equation is significantly smaller than 
the pressure calculated using the Navier-Stokes equations.

This can be explained by two of the assumptions on which the derivation of the 
Reynolds equation is based: negligible velocity components and pressure differences 
in the gap height direction. In the following, Figure 3-2 shows the velocity profiles in 
the gap direction from the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations; these grow with 
increasing dimple depth and support pressure generation.

3.3 
Investigation of dimple geometry and arrangement 
Cross section geometry  
The influence of dimple cross section geometry on hydrodynamic pressure build up 
was investigated by means of a simulation. Calculations were performed with a 
commercial CFD code (CFX) under consideration of the cavitation model explained in 
chapter 3.2. In addition to dimple cross section geometry, the dimple depth was var-
ied in such a way that the optimum range of gap height to dimple depth could be de-
termined. Figure 3-3 summarises the computational model, including the quantities 
which were kept constant as well as the variables. The width of the dimples was held 
constant between all variants for a better comparison. In coordination with the Insti-
tute of Production Engineering and Machine Tools, henceforth IFW, it could be de-
termined that the variants investigated in the simulation could actually be manufac-
tured by means of cutting processes. Variants in dimple geometry were considered to 
fall into two distinct classes: symmetric (base, variants 1 and 2) and non-symmetric 
(variants 3 - 8). For practical purposes, the variant geometry is presented in a simpli-
fied manner.

Methods and models for the design of microstructures 
 
Figure 3-3: Variants for dimple cross section variation 
Figure 3-4 shows the hydrodynamic pressure for the base configuration as a function 
of the dimple depth. It can be seen that the pressure distributions are very similar in 
the range of optimum dimple depths; a fact which does not allow for a significant 
conclusion to be drawn. It was therefore decided to compare the resultant forces ra-
ther than the pressure distributions. 
 
Figure 3-4: Pressure distributions of the base configuration (exemplary) 
In the following, dimple cross section geometries are evaluated in contrast to the 
base configuration. For a better overview, variants are subdivided into symmetric and 
non-symmetric ones. Figure 3-5 presents symmetric geometries. It can be seen here  

Methods and models for the design of microstructures

that, for low h/t relations, variants 1 and 2 show an improved load carrying capacity 
relative to the base configuration; this capacity reaches its optimum for h/t ratios 
close to 0.15. With an increasing h/t ratio, towards shallow dimples, the pressures 
even out among all variants. 
 
Figure 3-5:  Symmetric dimple geometries 
In Figure 3-6, variants 3 - 5 are compared to the base. Here, the generated pressures 
exceed those of the base variant. Compared to the symmetric dimple contours, the 
optimum ratio of gap to dimple depth (h/t) is increased, indicating a better perfor-
mance of non-symmetric dimples for shallow dimple depths.  
 
Figure 3-6:  Non-symmetric dimple geometries 
Figure 3-7 shows another comparison between non-symmetric and base configura-
tions. Variants 6 - 8 are similar to variants 3-5; however, they are mirrored relative to 
the direction of motion. In this case, an improved load carrying capacity could be rec-
orded for the non-symmetric contours relative to the base configuration, especially for 
gap-to-depth ratios (h/t) smaller than 0.25.

Methods and models for the design of microstructures 
 
Figure 3-7: Non-symmetric dimple geometries (continued) 
The results of this investigation indicate that the dimple cross section geometry influ-
ences the load carrying capacity minimally. A comparison with the base configuration 
shows that employing a rectangular cross section, as well as symmetric dimple cross 
sections with circular or triangular shape, results in an improved pressure generation. 
However, it appears prudent to suggest focusing further investigations on ellipsoidal 
dimple cross sections, as these are characterised by a comparatively uncomplicated 
fabrication process. 
Investigating the influence of dimple geometry on load carrying capacity indicated 
that local geometry alterations had a minimal impact on the load carrying capacity of 
the system, and that the optimum ratio between gap height and dimple depth lies be-
tween 0.2 and 0.3.  
Lateral dimple position  
Taking the results presented in the previous chapter into consideration, the hydrody-
namic load carrying capacity for a model with three dimples was investigated to iden-
tify the optimum dimple configuration. The inlet length L1, the dimple distance L2, held 
constant between the second and the third dimple, and the exit length L3 were varied. 
The circular dimple geometry was chosen because earlier results indicated that it has 
superior load carrying capacity, at least in some instances. Another reason for this 
choice was the similarity of this geometry to the geometries manufactured by means 
of cutting edges at IFW (compare variant 1 in Figure 3-5). The ratio of gap width to 
dimple depth used in the models and calculations was chosen to be h/t=0.2: close to 
the higher end of the identified optimum between 0.1 and 0.2. 
The following figure shows an exemplary pressure distribution for a study with re-
spect to the exit length. All studies were conducted using the same boundary condi-
tions (c.f. chapter 3.2) including ambient pressures (1 bar) at inlet and exit. The upper 
bounding surface was moved with a shear velocity of 10 m/s from left to right relative 
to the stationary dimpled lower bounding surface. For comparison purposes, the av-

15 
erage load carrying pressure was computed and compared between different config-
urations. 
 
Figure 3-8: Exemplary pressure distribution for the 3 dimple model 
Dimple distance L2 
For given and equal inlet and exit lengths L1=L3 , the inter-dimple distance L2 was var-
ied between 20 μm and 100 μm. The results showed only an insignificant influence of 
the inter-dimple distance on the load carrying pressures. Although the investigations 
did not allow for a significant conclusion with regards to the dimple positioning, locat-
ing them closely to each other appears to be, by a small margin, the more benefitial 
option (Figure 3-9).  
 
Figure 3-9: Variation of inter-dimple distance 
Inlet length L1 and exit length L3 
The variation of both inlet- and exit-length was conducted for a constant inter-dimple 
distance of 50μm. For the inlet-length variation, an exit length of 100 μm was held 
constant. Vice versa, for the exit-length variation, an inlet length of 100 μm was held 

16 
Methods and models for the design of microstructures 
constant. Figure 3-10 shows the effect of the length variation on the average load 
carrying pressure. When increasing the inlet length, the average bearing pressures 
decreases (red bars). A comparison between the pressure distribution and the base-
line, Figure 3-10, indicates that cavitation, as a reason for the pressure, decreases 
along L1. An increased inlet length L1 results in an increased cavitated region and 
can be therefore identified as the cause of loss in load carrying capacity. 
 
Figure 3-10:  Variation of inlet and exit lengths 
In contrast to the inlet length variation, the average load carrying pressure increases 
with increasing exit length L3. The throttle effect, which increases pressures and de-
creases the extent of the cavitated region, was identified as a reason for this phe-
nomenon. Figure 3-11 shows hydrodynamic pressures on the left and volume fraction 
of gas and oil on the right for all three dimples. The gas fraction can be seen as an 
indicator for an occurring cavitation. 
 
Figure 3-11:  Hydrodynamic pressures and volume fraction gas in the fluid 
All in all, the obtained results helped identify the exit length as the most significant 
parameter influencing the generation of load carrying pressures. Consequently, it

was concluded that placing non-dimpled areas with constant width downstream of the 
dimples would have a positive effect on the load carrying capacity. 
Study of 3D dimple cross section geometry  
An additional series of simulations was devoted to the study of the influence of dim-
ple cross section lateral to the direction of the flow and upper surface velocity. When

which leads to a contour of a dimple with a width-variable depth while the cutter en-
gages in the cylinder liner. The influence of the depth variation was studied for a 
model dimple with 5 μm maximum depth, subjected to the boundary conditions out-
lined in chapter 3.2. Moreover, a real variable width dimple contour was compared to 
a sharp edged constant depth contour. 
The pressure distribution shown in Figure 3-12 was characterised by a pressure de-
crease in front of the dimple in its upstream section, relative to the direction of mo-
tion. Similarly to the observed two dimensional models, this was caused by cavita-
tion. Downstream, behind the dimple, a steady decrease of pressures to the ambient 
boundary pressure could be observed. 
 
Figure 3-12:  Overview 3D-Model geometry and pressure distribution 
Figure 3-13 compares pressure distributions of both models in transverse (width) di-
rection. The upper bounding surface and hence most of the flow move orthogonally 
in the longitudinal direction. The flanks of the pressure distributions show significant 
differences, e.g. the rounded contour is characterised by steeper flanks, leading to 
higher overall pressures and to an improved load carrying capacity. 
A comparison of the two dimensional computations (Figure 3-5, Chapter 3.3) shows 
that the base and variation 1 exhibit similar trends even though the investigated con-
tours were oriented longitudinally in flow direction. Furthermore, the rounded contour 
supports a stronger pressure generation.

Simulation model for piston ring friction coefficient test rig  
A simulation model for the prediction of measurements, taken on the test rig for pis-
ton ring friction coefficients, was established with the simulation tool KORI3D.

Aside from the geometry and dynamic boundary conditions, the surface topographies 
of the ring and the liner were represented in the model with the help of Patir and 
&KHQJ¶VIORZIDFWRUVVHHFigure 3-15).  
The friction coefficients for metal-to-metal contact under boundary lubrication condi-
tions had to be defined prior to the input for KORI3D. To accomplish this, dedicated 
tribometric tests for each ring were performed with the SRV test rig (Figure 3-14). Us-
ing this information, a full factorial simulation plan was set up, covering the range of

ly known previously. 
 
Figure 3-15:  Surface roughness profiles piston rings and cylinder liner 
Figure 3-16 shows the comparison between the measured and the simulated friction 
forces for the top ring. A good qualitative agreement between them can be observed. 
The discrepancies which characterise the locations where the direction of motion is 
reversed are assumed to be related to the use of piezo quarz force measurements. 
Under static loads, the signal from the force measurement system vanishes within 
0.1 seconds. For the angular speed investigated, the time between reversal points is 
0.16 seconds, which facilitates the assumption that some portion of the measured 
signal disappears before reaching the reversal point. For a more detailed discussion 
on how such a simulation model can be fine-tuned, see reference [KNO08].

Methods and models for the design of microstructures 
Despite the differences between measurements and simulation close to the reversal 
points, both test rig and simulation appear to be suited to characterise the influence 
of cylinder liner surface topography on the friction. 
Furthermore, tribometer tests showed that noise in the signal increases with angular 
speed. The reason for this is the presence of vibrations which increase when the 
speed increases. To counteract this undesired behaviour and to provide the ability to 
vary the ring preload, a new fixture for the piston rings was designed (see Figure 
3-17).  
 
Figure 3-17:  New piston ring fixture for variable ring preloads 
The preload is generated by two cylinders with a conical wall; tightening a bolt moves 
the surfaces closer to each other and forces the rings to open. To maintain a con-
stant preload during operation, the bolt is secured by a lock nut.  
3.5 Design and validation of a test engine simulation model 
A simulation model for the software KORI/PRO was designed to investigate the ef-
fects of structured surfaces on friction and oil consumption in the tribo-mechanical 
piston ring/cylinder liner system. This simulation reflected the one cylinder test engine 
run at the Institute for Technical Combustion (see chapter 8), henceforth ITV; it was 
used to compute piston ring motion, blow-by losses, and oil consumption and was 
validated using engine test data. In the following, the theoretical background of the 
software is explained. 
Theoretical foundation  
The effect of small-scale surface roughness, reflecting its micro-hydrodynamic prop-
erties, on the pressure generation in a macro-scale lubricated contact was deter-
mined by means of a flow simulation. In this flow simulation, executed on a small but 
representative area with 3D surface roughness, the Reynolds equation of lubrication 
theory was solved under simple boundary conditions, and the flow was compared to 
that of a smooth surface. The principal elements of the pressure and shear flow ten-
sors were determined for two different situations: pure pressure and pure shear.

was focused on improving the numerical treatment and on the addition of a solid-to-
solid contact pressure/deformation model, reflecting the individual surface roughness. 
In this effort, software modules for the generation of surface roughness (SIMOBF) as 
well as for the determination of flow factors (FLOSIM) were created. Numerical re-
sults obtained with FLOSIM were compared to two different analytical solutions, each 
representing slight differences in the roughness correlation functions, and a high lev-
el of agreement among them could be observed, validating the software. On the mac-
ro-scale of a real bearing global effects of surface roughness were reflected in the 
Reynolds equation modified by flow tensors as below.

The simulation tool KORI3D, used for the analysis of piston ring friction and sealing, 
was developed during previous research projects, named ³3iston Ring Friction I-,,´
[KNO92], [KNO94]. KORI3D determines piston ring motion relative to ring groove and 
liner resultant from inner and outer loading. It is based on a multibody type formula-
tion for piston ring motion coupled with physical interdependencies related to gas-
dynamics, inertia effects, and lubricant friction. It also includes surface roughness ef-
fects.

developed within previous research projects and utilises results from the KORI3D 
simulations as its basis. Together with PRO, a matching procedure for the overall 
blow-by losses in KORI3D was developed; this procedure significantly enhanced the 
accuracy of the results. 
A verification using experimental results, showed a high level of agreement between 
the measured and the simulated oil consumptions [KNO06] [KNO08].

Figure 3-21:  Modelling approach 
While modelling the test engine, the following conditions were considered: 
x Combustion pressures and ±temperatures;  
x Measured liner temperatures; 
x Liner roughness structures; 
x Piston ring geometry and related data; 
x Oil film characteristics. 
For the validation of the model, blow-by values taken from engine test data, which 
reflect the cylinder liner subjected to the fines honing process, were evaluated. Using 
these test data, the flow coefficients of the gas-flow model were calibrated for all 
speeds.

Effect of liner roughness on piston ring dynamics  
Using the calibrated simulation model, piston ring and oil consumption simulations 
were performed to evaluate the effects of manufactured liner surface roughness pat-
terns on the piston ring friction and oil consumption under fired engine operation. 
Surface roughness patterns relate to:

Serial honing;

Figure 3-24:  Friction losses piston rings 
Mean pressure losses as a function of speed and load are presented in Figure 3-25. 
Simulated and measured results were compared, showing a good qualitative agree-
ment. 
The causes of the existing deviations can be explained as follows:  
x Cylinder liners distort during assembly due to the tightening of the bolts and 
during operation - due to the thermal expansion of the materials. Previous 
studies observe that higher order distortions, in particular, have critical influ-
ence when compared to computed results. However, cylinder liner distortions 
were an unknown variable in this project and hence could not be included in 
the simulation. 
x Measured friction losses include piston rings, piston as well as the whole 
crank assembly, including connecting rods; the simulation, on the other hand, 
covers the piston rings only. Therefore, a quantitative agreement cannot be 
expected.

Figure 3-25: Friction mean effective pressures (FMEP) as a function of speed and load (meas-
ured vs. computed results) 
Results show that structured cylinder liners exhibit the lowest friction losses near their 
top dead centres (TDC). Liners produced with other manufacturing processes show 
very similar friction losses as well. This indicates that friction losses depend more on 
engine speed than on engine load, regardless of the liner surface structure. 
In contrast to other lubricated components (e.g., fluid film bearings), higher engine 
speeds result in reduced friction. This is due to a decrease in mixed friction: a conse-
quence of higher surface speeds and related hydrodynamic pressures. In the meas-
urements, the correlation between friction and speed increase can be explained by 
the journal bearings (main bearings and connecting rod bearings). 
Surface topology effects on oil consumption  
The assessment of the oil emissions in the investigated engine relied on the results 
obtained in the piston ring simulation. Further input, taking into consideration thermo-
dynamic quantities, was directly determined by ITV, using the test engine, and con-
sequently provided to IMK. 
 
Figure 3-26:  Oil consumption as a function of load and speed (measured vs. simulated) 
As can be seen from Figure 3-26, measured oil consumptions correlate well with the 
simulated results as far as load and speed dependencies are concerned. Structured 
liners exhibit lower oil consumption behaviour compared to all other liners, especially 
at lower speeds. Deviations between measured and simulated results are very likely

related to the unknown liner distortions caused by assembly and thermal effects, as 
mentioned above. 
3.6 Conclusion 
The main objective of this subproject consisted in the development of simulation 
techniques for the tribological characterisation of deterministic and stochastic surface 
structures with regards to friction, wear and oil consumption in the piston ring-cylinder 
system. 
Based on fluid dynamic computations, the influence of micro-dimple geometry on the 
load carrying capacity of lubricated contacts was investigated in the first phase. Re-
sults clearly show that micro-dimples can support an increased load carrying capaci-
ty, while details in the cross section geometry of the dimples exhibit only a minor in-
fluence on hydrodynamic loads. In addition, the effects of different dimple configura-
tions were investigated. It was concluded that the exit length is the most relevant ge-
ometric feature for an increased hydrodynamic pressure. 
In the second project phase, the concept of flow tensors was used to transfer the re-
sults of the first phase to the piston ring/cylinder liner system. Calculation of the prin-
cipal values of the flow tensor (i.e., the flow factors), the friction factors, and the con-
tact pressures was performed using the program FLOSIM. The obtained results were 
stored in lookup tables as a function of the gap height. Based on these tables, sub-
sequent programs (KORI, PRO) were employed to compute piston ring motion, pis-
ton ring friction, and oil consumption.  
Four different liner manufacturing techniques were compared: honing (series pro-
cess), fine honing, machining and thermal coating. Results show that close to the top 
dead centre (TDC) position, structured (dimpled) liners exhibit their lowest friction 
rates. All other surfaces show very similar friction rates. Furthermore, surfaces with 
micro-dimples are characterised by low oil consumption, especially at low engine 
speeds. 
Test results from the one cylinder test engine, provided by ITV, were used to validate 
the simulation. A comparison between test and simulation shows a high level of 
agreement between the measured and the simulated results.

4.1 Objective and approach 
Goal of this subproject was to explore and develop a cutting process for the manufac-
turing of high-quality, friction-reducing micro-dimples. Prerequisite was the use of a 
single-edge cutting tool. To meet this challenge, the following subgoals were defined: 
x Identification of the correlations between process and system variables and 
the geometry and quality of micro-dimples 
x Development of strategies for machining the inner surfaces of cylindrical com-
ponents 
To this purpose, the correlations and interactions between the process variables and 
the geometry and quality of the micro-dimples to be machined had to be determined. 
This was necessary in order to define process limits as well as to determine process 
parameters and tool geometries for high-quality machining. To transfer these results 
to tribologically stressed components like cylinder liners, economically efficient strat-
egies for the machining of inner walls of cylinder surfaces had to be developed.   
To achieve these goals, the following approach was selected: The basics of a novel 
cutting technology for high-quality machining of geometrically defined micro-dimples 
with single-edge cutting tools were developed by means of fly-cutting experiments 
under variation of the system and control variables. Based on the experimental 
methods developed during the course of the project, the chip formation process was 
analysed for the present process kinematics. Consequently, material-, component- 
and tool-dependent as well as kinematic parameters influencing the quality character-
istics of micro-dimples were identified and analysed. They were evaluated and classi-
fied with respect to the quality characteristics surface quality and burr dimensions. 
Using an analogue examination of the processes in the chip formation zone, basic 
correlations and interactions could be determined.  
These basics were finally integrated in the elaboration and development of a process 
strategy suitable for the machining of the inner surfaces of cylinder components. The 
most important aspects were the correlations between geometry and kinematics, 
their influence on the arrangement and the geometry of micro-dimples, and the exist-
ing process limits. By transferring these results onto WKHGHPRQVWUDWRU³&\OLQGHU/Ln-
HU´GHYHORSHGZLWKLQWKHVFRSHRIWKLVjoint research project, the suitability and usabil-
ity of this method could be validated. The integration of the microstructuring process 
within existing process chains as well as the tool systems required for this purpose 
were exemplarily illustrated for this demonstrator.

4.2 Experimental set-up ± fly-cutting tests 
To investigate the basic correlations between process variables, quality characteris-
tics and chip formation mechanisms, fly-cutting tests were carried out on a Blohm 
Profimat 307 profile grinder, where the rotating cutting tool cuts through a plane sur-
face (Figure 4-1). As the cutting tool oscillates around the peripheral surface of an 
aluminium disc and is simultaneously displaced in axial direction, the cutting edge of 
the tool describes a helical trajectory along the workpiece surface (Figure 4-1). The 
feed rate is negligible, as it is significantly lower than the cutting speed. The axial 
feed is larger than the highest expected micro-dimple width. Thus, a mutual interac-
tion between adjacent micro-dimples can be excluded. By clamping the specimen 
with an inclination, micro-dimples with an increasing depth can be created. Due to the 
large rotational radius (rrot = 140 mm), the cutting edge enters and exits the work-
piece surface at a very flat angle. In this way, the specific effects occurring at tool en-
try and exit can be examined.  
 
Figure 4-1: Fly-cutting test procedure  
Test materials 
Globular cast iron (GJS400), hypereutectic aluminum-silicon cast alloy (AlSi17-
Cu4Mg) as well as a thermally sprayed high-density iron molybdenum coating 
(Fe50Mo) were used as test materials. These three materials are typically used in 
cylinder liners although they differ considerably in their non-homogenous structural 
texture. Figure 4-2 compares the microstructure of the materials used. Most tests 
were carried out using ferritic carbon steel (S235JR) with a finely grained homoge-
nous structure.

Microstructuring by means of cutting processes 
Test tools 
For the test series, CCGT0602 rhombic fine-grain indexable inserts for hard alloy 
were used. To ensure good comparability, only sharpened cutting edges were ap-
plied. Figure 4-3 shows the geometries varied at the cutting edge. Rake, clearance 
and effective tool cutting edge angles were achieved by grinding. Specific cutting 
edge radiuses of rE = 5 μm to 30 μm were realised via the Magnetfinish process.  
 
Figure 4-3: Tools with different geometries 
The analytical methods introduced above proved insufficient for the identification of 
the correlations between process variables and the quality characteristics surface 
quality and burr dimensions. For this reason and taking the used kinematics into con-
sideration, novel methods for the measuring of highly-dynamic cutting forces, as well 
as for the generation of chip roots, were developed.  
Formation of chip roots by means of a quick-stop device 
In the following, the design, structure and validation of the quick-stop device is shown 
for the kinematics used for microstructuring (Figure 4-4). The cutting tool as well as 
the body-stop can be moved into the aluminium disc by pivoting (cutting tool) or by 
linear displacement (body-stop). They can be locked by means of a special locking 
device. All guides have clearance fits with narrow tolerances. The distance between 
the cutting tool and the body-stop is adjustable, too. In this way, quick-stops along 
the cut are possible at different positions. During the test, the aluminium disc first ro-
tates with a defined cutting speed above the specimen. By manual release of an in-
ductive actuator, the locking device is actuated shortly after passing the specimen. 
After that the cutting tool and the body-stop are abruptly reeled out, supported by the 
spring and the centrifugal forces. In case of a repeated passing of the specimen, the 
cutting edge enters each time with a pre-defined depth of cut into the surface of the 
specimen. As soon as the desired quick-stop position is reached, the specimen is ab-
ruptly accelerated in cutting direction by the adjustable body-stop. The specimen is 
screwed to the slide of a spring-loaded dovetail guide and is held during the cut in its 
position by means of a slotted cylinder bolt, until the body-stop is retracted. Due to 
the slight inclination of the guide (inclination angle = 2 °), the specimen moves mini-
mally downwards, thus providing for an even quicker stop with an increased repro-
ducibility.  

Microstructuring by means of cutting processes 
31 
 
Figure 4-4: Structure and functioning of the quick-stop device with adjustable body-stop 
The quick-stop device was validated at cutting speeds vc  ranging between 30 and 
300 m/min by means of SEM analysis of the chip roots. The SEM images in Figure 
4-5, left, show four chip roots machined under identical conditions at a cutting speed 
of vc = 240 m/min. The nearly identical quick-stop position as well as the shape of the 
chip roots (chip length, chip flow direction) suggest an appropriate reproducibility. In 
addition, no imperfections which would suggest kinematic errors or vibrations during 
the quick-stop can be seen in the chip area. Figure 4-5, bottom left, compares the 
chip roots for systematically varied cutting speeds in the range of vc = 30 m/min to 
300 m/min. Here, it is already possible to recognize cutting speed-dependent chip 
formation effects, such as a decreasing chip compression ratio with higher cutting 
speeds. Similarly, the dependence of the acceleration distance (difference between 
quick-stop position and desired quick-stop position) on the cutting speed is quite evi-
dent (Figure 4-5, right). The differing acceleration distances show a quasi-linear be-
haviour for the respective cutting speed range. This means that the acceleration dis-
tance increases by 1.66 μm per m/min. Despite the large acceleration distances 
compared to the depth of cut, comprehensive analyses prove no restrictions when 
determining the various impacts on chip formation.

Highly dynamic cutting force measuring method 
In order to describe the mechanisms during the cut and with special consideration of 
the materials used when machining cylinder liners, a highly dynamic cutting force 
measuring method was developed and validated. For this purpose, KISTLER 9213 
one-component piezo force sensors were applied. To measure the cutting force as 
well as the passive force at the same time, two sensors had to be used. The speci-
mens were adhesively bonded to the sensor. Figure 4-6 shows the structure of the 
cutting force measuring system. 
 
Figure 4-6: Highly dynamic cutting force measuring method 
The natural frequency of the sensors used was f0 = 27 kHz without and f0 = 22 kHz 
with a specimen weighing 4 grams. To get exact results for subsequent tests with dif-

Microstructuring by means of cutting processes 
33 
ferent materials, the force sensors were displaced along slotted specimens at cutting 
speeds ranging from vc = 30 m/min to vc = 360 m/min. Figure 4-6, bottom right, 
shows the cutting force and the passive force while machining at vc = 30 m/min. The 
cutting force characteristics describe the slotted surface topography exactly. The val-
idation of the test results proved that the sensors can be reliably used in processes 
characterized by an excitation frequency of ferr = 5.2 kHz. For higher excitation fre-
quencies, the measured signal level is still significant, but the signal itself is already 
superimposed by harmonics.  
4.3 High-quality cutting of micro-dimples 
For the reliable application of machined micro-dimples in tribological systems, quality 
characteristics like cutting area topography, burr dimension, and contour accuracy 
have to be considered. In the following, all relevant cutting correlations as well as 
their influence on the resulting quality of micro-dimples are explained. In the first 
place, process-, tool- and material-specific parameters and interactions are exam-
ined.  
Cutting edge: mechanisms  
When cutting a micro-dimple, the cutting edge enters into the surface in a circular arc 
with a depth of cut of ap = 0 μm, reaches a maximum depth of cut of ap,max and exits 
the surface with a depth of cut of ap = 0 μm. No geometrical deviations from the de-
sired contour and modifications depending on the depth of cut of the machined sur-
face topography can be identified. According to the characteristics of the burr dimen-
sions shown in Figure 4-7, the burr volume VG follows a parabolic curve along the 
cut.  
From the entry of the cutting edge up to the maximum depth of cut (1 - 2), the curve 
is characterised by a steep increase of the burr volume, reaching its maximum in the 
range of the maximum depth of cut (2).This increase of the burr volume is due to the 
quantity of the material that is plastically deformed by the cutting edge. The quantity 
increases exponentially along the depth and the cross-section of the cut. At the same 
time, there is an increased amount of material, overflowing the free edges and form-
ing a burr. In the exit area of the cutting edge (3), the decrease of the burr dimen-
sions is less than their previous increase in the entry area despite the decreasing 
depth of cut. The cross-section of the cut decreases exponentially, but not the cross-
section of the chip, as seen in the SEM image shown in Figure 4-7, right. For the 
maximum depth of cut (2), the cross-section of the cut is maximal as well, going 
along with a high friction between the separated chip and the cutting surface. The 
friction forces are higher than the forces required for the chip compression ratio so 
that a decrease in the cross-section of the cut results in only a minimal decrease in 
the chip compression ratio. For the same depth of cut, the material quantity overflow-
ing the free edges is consequently larger than in the entry area. The asymmetrical 
burr formation can be explained by the fact that the cutting speed vector enters into 
the surface in the entry area of the cutting edge and exits it in the exit area. The con-

34 
Microstructuring by means of cutting processes 
siderably higher burr volume at the exit of the cutting edge is caused by the chip tear-
off.  
 
Figure 4-7: Formation of the burr volume and the chip along the cut 
The dynamic change of the cutting conditions along the cut is accompanied by a dy-
namic change of the machining forces. As shown in Figure 4-7, bottom, the absolute 
cutting and passive forces describe a parabolic curve so that the maximum machin-
ing forces are in the range of the maximum depth of cut. The variation of the force 
signals, as can be seen in the SEM images, is caused by a discontinuous burr for-
mation. 
 
 

Microstructuring by means of cutting processes 
35 
Influence of cutting speed on quality characteristics and chip formation 
To identify cutting speed-dependent correlations for the presented fly-cutting process 
as well as the optimal cutting speed for high-quality machining of micro-dimples, the 
latter was varied in five steps from vc = 30 m/min to vc = 480 m/min. Consequently, 
the quality characteristics, i.e., machined surface topography, burr dimension, and 
component subsurface, were compared with the chip formation process (Figure 4-8). 
 
Figure 4-8: Influence of cutting speed on machined surface topography, burr dimensions and chip 
formation 
At small cutting speeds (< 100 m/min), the surface exhibits distinct chipping in cutting 
direction. Micrographs show a plastically deformed zone of 2 μm to 3 μm thickness in 
the machined surface. At higher cutting speeds, the topography of the machined sur-
face is comparatively flat, without distinct chipping and plastic deformations. This 
trend can also be observed for the longitudinal roughness (Figure 4-8, left). With in-
creasing cutting speeds, the roughness decreases exponentially from Ra = 0.17 μm 
to Ra = 0.04 μm, whereas no further deviations can be observed in the cutting speed 
range from vc = 120 m/min to 480 m/min. At cutting speeds below vc = 100 m/min, the 
burr volume decreases exponentially from VG = 60,000 μm³ to VG = 30,000 μm³. No 
significant deviations can be observed for cutting speeds from vc = 120 m/min 
to 480 m/min either. As shown by the SEM images inFigure 4-8, the burrs increase 
and become more homogenous with increasing cutting speeds.  

36 
Microstructuring by means of cutting processes 
The decrease in chipping, in plastic deformation of the subsurface as well as in burr 
dimensions with increasing cutting speeds can be explained by the deformation pro-
cesses in the chip formation zone. The polished micrograph sections of the chip roots 
in Figure 4-8 show that the chip compression ratio and the chip thickness decrease 
when the cutting speeds are increased from vc = 60 m/min up to vc = 480 m/min. This 
results in a larger shear angle and a smaller shearing cross-section. The simultane-
ous decrease in the chip surface contact area results in a decreased coefficient of 
friction. In addition, the increasing strain rate and strain concentration zone are char-
acterized by a stronger shear localisation. According to [BEN02] and [TOE11], this 
leads to a thermal softening of the material which counteracts the hardening occur-
ring during the chip formation process. The lower deformation content in the chip 
formation zone is accompanied by a reduction in the µploughing¶ processes, causing 
chipping and plastically deformed subsurfaces. The energetically more favourable 
material separation is characterised by the specific cutting force, which declines by 
about 65 % for the respective cutting speed range. 
As demonstrated by the presented results, higher cutting speeds are favourable for 
the manufacturing of high-quality micro-dimples. For this reason, cutting speeds 
above vc = 120 m/min were selected for the further course of the process. 
Tool-specific parameters influencing the quality of the micro-dimples and the 
chip formation process 
In the following, tool-specific parameters which influence the quality characteristics 
and the chip formation are described. In a first step, wedge geometry and shape of 
the cutting edge are examined. In a second step, the cutting edge profile is consid-
ered. 
Clearance angle 
The examination showed that the clearance angle has no influence on the quality 
characteristics in the respective variation range of D = 3 ° to 28 °. However, it should 
be noted that the use of clearance angles above D = 15 ° is not process-reliable due 
to unpredictable cutting edge breakouts.  
Rake angle 
The rake angle was varied in 10 °-steps from J = -10 ° to 20 ° at a constant clearance 
angle (D = 7 °). Compared to large clearance angles, no cutting edge breakouts were 
identified for positive rake angles (J = 20 °). Similarly to the preceding chapter, the 
changing of the quality characteristics is described here as well; furthermore, the 
most important correlations and interactions are exemplified on the basis of a chip 
formation analysis. As shown in Figure 4-9, the rake angle affects burr dimensions 
and chip formation considerably. For the respective rake angle range, the burr vol-
ume VG linearly decreases by about 70 %.  
While the rake angle influences the specific cutting forces minimally, the specific pas-
sive forces significantly decrease with positive rake angles (Figure 4-9, middle). 

Microstructuring by means of cutting processes 
37 
These differences diminish with the depth of cut but do exist throughout the complete 
range of the depth of cut. The force ratio increases progressively with the increase of 
the depth of cut, meaning that there is a direct correlation between the cutting force 
and the depth of cut. On the other hand, the force ratio level increases with a positive 
rake angle, which results from a decrease in the specific passive forces. This rake 
angle-dependent dominance of the passive force is also seen in the rotating experi-
ments described by [DEN07], who explains it with the change of the direction of the 
resulting cutting force vectors in dependence on the rake angle.  
 
Figure 4-9: Influence of the rake angle on burr dimensions, forces and chip formation 

38 
Microstructuring by means of cutting processes 
The chip roots formed for different rake angles with identical process variables are 
compared in Figure 4-9, bottom. The degree of deformation in the chip formation 
zone decreases with positive rake angles, resulting from a decrease in the chip com-
pression ratio and the accompanying increase of the shear angle. At a rake angle of 
J = 20 °, the compression level is very low (O ĺ 1) so that the initial material texture 
can clearly be seen in the chip roots. According to [DEN07], this correlation can be 
explained by the fact that the chip flow on the chip surface is less likely to be diverted 
when the rake angles are positive, i.e., the chip flow on the chip surface is energeti-
cally more favourable. Thus, chip compression ratio, shear cross-section, and chip 
surface contact are reduced, resulting in an energetically more favourable separation 
process. Moreover, the SEM images show how the measured burr volumes increase 
with negative rake angles. Much more material is formed at the sides of the chip root, 
which indicates a distinct lateral flow in front of the cutting edge. Part of the material, 
which has been accumulated along the free edges at the sides of the chip root, re-
mains in form of a burr. 
Cutting edge radius 
Due to the small depths of the cuts, the cutting edge radius rE plays an important role 
when creating micro-dimples. The extent to which the cutting edge radius influences 
the quality characteristics of the micro-dimples as well as the processes taking place 
during the chip formation is explained in the following paragraphs. The tests were 
based on a variation of the cutting edge radius in five steps from rE = 5 μm to 30 μm. 
A confocal microscope was used to take topographic images of the middle of a mi-
cro-dimple manufactured with different cutting edge radiuses and with a maximum 
depth of cut of ap,max = 30 μm (Figure 4-10, top). The influence of the cutting edge ra-
dius on the chip formation as well as the longitudinal roughness profiles and burr di-
mensions is shown in Figure 4-10 and discussed below. 
For a cutting edge radius from rE = 5 μm to 15 μm, the roughness first increased line-
arly from Rz = 0.28 μm to Rz = 0.49 μm. According to [ALB60, SUB08], this increase 
is based on WKHµploughing effects¶, whereby the material sporadically flows below the 
cutting edge, leaving chipping on the generated surface. At rE = 15 μm to 30 μm, the 
longitudinal roughness decreases to Rz = 0.32 μm again. [BET71] explains this de-
crease with the roll-smoothing effects: On the one hand, due to larger cutting edge 
radiuses, more material flows out of the stagnant area below the cutting edge; on the 
other hand, due to more negative rake angles, this material is incorporated more 
evenly into the surface.  
Similarly to the longitudinal roughness, the burr dimensions also show a contrary pro-
file. First, they increase linearly from rE = 5 μm to 20 μm by nearly 400 %. According 
to [JIV08], this rise is due to the expanded stagnant area ahead of the cutting edge. 
The simultaneous increase in material gathered up ahead of the cutting edge is, on 
the other hand, accompanied by a considerably stronger lateral flow in the direction 
of the free edges. As the rounding along the edge radius and, thus, along the cutting 
edge zone is evenly formed, the effective rake angle in the area of the free edges 

Microstructuring by means of cutting processes 
39 
becomes extremely negative. It additionally contributes to the lateral material flow 
over the free edges. However, when the cutting edge radius increases to rE = 30 μm, 
the burr dimensions decrease by nearly 30 % of the previous increase.

forces and chip formation

Microstructuring by means of cutting processes 
A detailed analysis of the cutting edges rounded by the Magnetfinish technology 
shows that the cutting edge of an extremely rounded tool (rE = 30 μm) is also re-
cessed due to the long machining time, leading to a larger edge radius rH. In this way, 
the effective tool cutting edge angle Neff at the free edges is reduced, resulting in de-
creased burr dimensions (see subsequent chapter). 
While the specific cutting force in the considered cutting edge area progressively in-
creases by about 15 %, the specific passive forces progressively increase by about 
45 %. The larger rising gradient indicates that the cutting edge radius has a consid-
erable influence on the passive force component. The increasing prevalence of the 
passive force is consistent with the linearly decreasing force ratio. According to 
[JIV08], this shift is due to changed geometrical contact conditions: on the one hand, 
larger cutting edge radiuses lead to a larger contact surface. On the other hand, they 
result in a considerably more negative effective rake angle Jeff and, thus, in a shift of 
the resulting cutting force vectors in direction of the passive force. Contrary to the 
findings of [JIV08], neither an increased chip compression ratio nor modified chip 
shapes or segmentation towards large cutting edge radiuses could be observed. As 
can be seen from the chip roots shown in Figure 4-10, bottom, the subsurface is plas-
tically deformed for a cutting edge radius of rE = 30 μm up to a depth of 5 μm to 6 μm. 
The smooth transition from the stagnant area to the subsurface indicates that the ma-
terial flows below the cutting edge and is then incorporated into the surface by 
ploughing and roll-smoothing processes, as already mentioned before.  
Tool profile geometry 
In cutting tool design, the tool profile geometry is of a paramount importance. Here, 
the effective tool cutting edge angle was identified as the most important parameter 
to influence the processes taking place on the free edges. To examine the correla-
tions which result from a variation of the effective tool cutting edge angles, the angles 
were systematically modified in five steps from Neff = 17 ° to 79 °. The tool cutting 
edge angle on the opposite side was kept constant at Neff = 50 °. Figure 4-11 shows 
the correlation between the development of the burr dimensions and the effective tool 
cutting edge angle as well as the processes taking place in the chip formation zone.  
The burr volume exponentially increases by a factor of 24 for the range of the ob-
served effective tool cutting edge angle. This trend can also be seen in the topo-
graphic images (Figure 4-11, top right). For very small effective tool cutting edge an-
gles, the burr volume asymptotically approximates zero. In order to find out the rea-
son for these significant differences, the chip formation process is analysed in the fol-
lowing. Figure 4-11, middle, compares chip roots and their micrographs created with 
effective tool cutting edge angles of Neff = 17/50/66 °. To illustrate the explanations, 
the bottom part of Figure 4.11 outlines the geometrical contact variables for a small 
and a large effective tool cutting edge angle. Based on the cross-sectional shape of 
the chip, which depends on the effective tool cutting edge angle, there are clear dif-
ferences in chip formation. The micrographs of the chips show that the plastic defor-

Microstructuring by means of cutting processes 
41 
mation degree at the free edges decreases with smaller effective tool cutting edge 
angles.  
 
Figure 4-11:  Influence of the effective tool cutting edge angle on burr dimensions and processes 
during chip formation 
The exceedingly homogenous chip edge for an effective tool cutting edge angle of 
Neff = 17 ° is another evidence for the dominance of the shear component with smaller 
effective tool cutting edge angles. This can be explained by different factors. The red 

42 
Microstructuring by means of cutting processes 
triangles of equal width (VNeff,small and VNeff,big) shown in Figure 4-11, bottom, corre-
spond to the material volume accumulated in the area of the free edges ahead of the 
cutting edge. It can be seen that the material volume which is plastically deformed at 
the free edges during the separation and which works against the shear localisation 
increases with the effective tool cutting edge angle. Consequently, the decrease of 
the burr dimensions with smaller effective tool cutting edge angles can be explained 
by the fact that the material flow is redirected towards the free surfaces in both direc-
tions. In figure 4-11, bottom; this is represented by the arrows which begin at the cen-
tres of the surface areas of the red triangles and cut through the free edge. At the 
same time, the vector of the burr force Fd moves incrementally in the direction of the 
free edge. 
Depending on which tribological parameters of a surface shall be realised by means 
of micro-dimples, cross-section profiles with small effective tool cutting edge angles 
at the free edges cannot always be applied, as seen in Figure 4-12. 
 
Figure 4-12:  Reduction in burr dimensions by use of positive tool cutting edge inclinations 
A positive tool cutting edge inclination Oscounteracts the disadvantageous burr for-
mation of large effective tool cutting edge angles. In this case, a cutting edge is used 

Microstructuring by means of cutting processes 
43 
whose positive rake angle of J = 13 ° goes around the edge radius and then changes 
into a tool cutting edge inclination of the same size.  
Along the edge radius, the constant contact conditions are placed orthogonally to the 
cutting edge. However, the positive rake angle changes into a positive tool cutting 
edge inclination of the same size. The reduced burr dimensions result from the fact 
that the positive tool cutting edge inclination as well as the positive rake angle favour 
shearing in the area of the free edges. Moreover, symmetrical positive tool cutting 
edge inclinations at the cutting edge lead the material away from the free edges be-
fore it reaches the cutting edge. They also concentrate it in the middle of the chip 
(see the arched chip rear side in Figure 4-12, bottom right). 
Material-specific separation mechanisms 
It was examined to what extent the results obtained for S235JR steel were also valid 
for the materials GJS400 and Fe50Mo when applied (i.e., thermally sprayed) to the 
inner surface of cylinder liners. The processes taking place in the chip formation zone 
were of special interest here; consequently, these were correlated with quality char-
acteristics, such as burr formation and machined surface topography. Figure 4-13 
compares the chip roots as well as the highly dynamic forces measured for the differ-
ent materials.  
Experimental evidence indicates that GJS400 cast iron exhibits a ductile material 
separation behaviour similar to the one of S235JR steel. Material separation is, how-
ever, locally interrupted by phase transitions and inclusions, which is also reflected in 
the measured highly dynamic forces. The machined surface topography shows open 
graphite pebbles partly bunching out of the machined surface. In micrographs, plastic 
deformations in the subsurface due to the separation process can be recognized. 
They are interrupted (i.e., partially separated from the surface) in the transition areas 
between graphite pores, ferrite seams, and basic pearlitic matrix due to different me-
chanical phase properties. The material is characterised by a distinct and uneven 
tendency to burr formation.  
In thermally sprayed Fe50Mo coatings, no continuous chips were formed which can 
be explained by the fact that most of the material ahead of the cutting edge is sepa-
rated by cohesive failure in the boundary areas of the sprayed lamella. This separa-
tion mechanism is also characterised by the highly dynamic forces measured. Sup-
porting and ploughing effects below the cutting edge nevertheless result in relatively 
smooth machined surface topographies. Since the adhesiveness of thermally 
sprayed coating is in the first place based on mechanical clamping of partly fused 
particles, tear-offs at the free edges can be explained by lacking supporting effects of 
the surrounding material. The material does not tend to burr formation.  
In general, the experiences made for steel can be transferred to the materials used 
here. Larger cutting edge radiuses result in increased burr dimensions for the ductile 
materials of S235JR steel and GJS400 cast iron. When machining thermally sprayed 
Fe50Mo coatings, large cutting edge radiuses have the advantage that they avoid 

44 
Microstructuring by means of cutting processes 
chipping at the free edges. Similar to S235JR steel, GJS400 cast iron tends to chip at 
low cutting speeds (vc< 80 m/min). When machining Fe50Mo coatings, no influence 
on the quality characteristics caused by the cutting speed could be verified.  
 
Figure 4-13:  Material-specific separation mechanisms 
Model for the prediction of burr dimensions 
As verified by the results presented above, burr dimensions at the free edges of ma-
chined micro-dimples are the most important quality characteristic. With respect to 
the tribological strain and to avoid subsequent finishing steps, burr formation must be 
avoided or is at least only tolerable for very small dimensions. The experiments car-
ried out prove that burr dimensions can be influenced to a large extent by the tool 
geometry. To consider these interactions in the process design of machining micro-
dimples, a model based on empirical data was developed to help predict burr dimen-
sions. The burr volume VG measured at the free edges serves as a basis for compar-
ison. Based on the data determined in test series, the significant variables were iden-
tified. The variables cutting speed, depth of cut, rake angle, clearance angle, cutting 
edge radius, and effective tool cutting edge angle were considered in the significance 
analysis. For reasons of comparison, all test results, except for the variation of the 

Microstructuring by means of cutting processes 
45 
depth of cut itself, were compared at a depth of cut of ap = 30 μm. When selecting a 
model approach, the results were implemented in a regression model where the qual-
itative characteristics of the burr volume were considered in dependence on the var-
ied size.  
The correlations between measured and modelled burr volume are qualitatively out-
lined in Figure 4-14. Moreover, the respective mathematical subfunctions are given 
below the single graphs. To determine the significant variables, the mean gradient is 
defined for each characteristic. Since the values of the gradient are still subject to the 
units of the respective variable, they have to be normalised. The significant variables 
are then determined via the ratio of the normalised gradient to the sum of all normal-
ised gradients. The respective significant component of each variable is shown in 
Figure 4-14, bottom.  
 
Figure 4-14:  Correlations between measured and modelled burr volume 
Variables whose normalised gradient is larger than 15 % of the sum of all normalised 
gradients were assumed to be significant. These are the cutting edge radius rE with a 
normalised gradient component of 15.1 % and the effective tool cutting edge angle 
with a normalised gradient component of 58.4 %. By applying linear regression anal-

46 
Microstructuring by means of cutting processes 
ysis and rounding off the determined coefficients up to the second decimal place, 
based on two significant variables, the model equation given in Figure 4-14, bottom 
right, is able to predict the burr volume. The verification of the model equation is giv-
en in Figure 4-14, bottom left. The modelled burr volumes map the measured burr 
volumes with a coefficient of determination of R² = 0.88. The model equation is also 
valid when the input variables are not the input variables of the model, as verified by 
the grey measuring points (verification). 
4.4 Inner structuring of rotationally symmetrical components 
Since tribologically stressed components like cylinder liners and thrust bearings gen-
erally have cylindrical surfaces, a process strategy was developed to cut micro-
dimples into cylindrical surfaces with the help of single-edge cutting tools.  
Process development for load-specific inner structuring of rotationally sym-
metrical surfaces 
Based on axially parallel turn-milling, a machining strategy for cutting micro-dimples 
into the inner surfaces of cylindrical components was developed and analysed sys-
tematically. It was realised on a Gildemeister TWIN32 turning machine equipped with 
a tool holder driven at a maximum revolution speed of nmax = 4000 1/min. As shown 
in Figure 4-15, a rotating fly-cutting tool is moved with defined radial displacement 
under axial feed along the surface of a likewise rotating component, cutting non-
overlapping micro-dimples below revolution ratio limit along the circumference of the 
component.  
 
Figure 4-15:  Process strategy for internal machining of cylindrical components 
For an axially parallel internal machining of cylindrical components, the kinematic cor-
relations and the influence of the process variables on the surface texture (i.e., ar-
rangement of micro-dimples on the surface) as well as the micro dimple geometry 
and the existing process limits are described in the following. The geometrical and 
kinematic contact conditions between tool cutting edge and component were ana-

47 
lysed in accordance with the mathematical basics given in [DER94, KRO69] and 
compared to those achieved by experiments.  
Process / tool design and process limits  
Kinematic parameters influencing micro dimple arrangement 
The parameters which considerably influence the surface characteristics are the axial 
feed fax and the revolution ratio (Figure 4-16, top). The revolution ratio 
Oncharacterises the ratio between tool and component revolution speed. The axial 
feed fax defines the distance sax between two micro-dimples when the component 
runs parallel to its axis of symmetry. The tangential distance stan between two micro-
dimples alonJWKHFRPSRQHQW¶VFLUFXPIHUHQFHLVGHILQHGE\WKHFRPSRQHQW¶VFLUFXm-

Based on the axial and tangential distance, the number of micro-dimples for a rec-

(4.3) 
Depending on the tribological application, not only the distance between the micro-
dimples but also their arrangement is of great importance. In this process, it is char-
acterised by the parallel offset Mtanof two micro-dimples (Figure 4-16, top). Com-
pared to the revolution ratio Oncomponent diameter, surface curvature, and tool tra-
jectory radius have no influence on the parallel offset. The diagram in Figure 4-16, 
left, shows the calculated curve of the parallel offset in dependence on the revolution 
ratio On = 10 to 16; in the diagram on the right, the range is enhanced from 
On = 10 to 11.5. In the upper part, optically measured topographic images of ma-
chined surfaces are compared. When the parallel offset is Mtan = 0°, the micro-
dimples are arranged in an exact line (i.e. no offset), which is always the case at in-
tegral revolution ratios. In the case of half-integral revolution ratios, the overlapping 
micro-dimples are offset in axial direction by exactly half of their tangential distance 
(50 % offset). Between an integral and a half-integral revolution ratio, the micro-
dimples are incrementally offset to the left (negative sign); between a half-integral 
and an integral revolution ratio, they are offset to the right (positive sign). With in-
creasing revolution ratio, the tangential indexing ttan and thus the tangential distance 
stan of the micro-dimples is reduced.  

48 
Microstructuring by means of cutting processes 
 
Figure 4-16:  Surface characteristics and parallel offset in dependence on revolution ratio 
Kinematic parameters influencing micro dimple geometry 
In process design, it should be considered that the length of cut varies depending on 
the up- and down-milling as well as on the revolution ratio between tool and compo-
nent. In Figure 4-17, the stretching rate Gc and the upsetting rate Gu,, which charac-
terise the ratio of the non-distorted length of cut to the distorted one, as well as the 
effective clearance angle Deff are plotted against the revolution ratio for up- and 
down-milling. The measured values match the calculated ones very well.  
During both up- and down-milling, small revolution ratios result in a severe distortion 
of the tool trajectory; thus, during up-milling the stretching rate Gs - and during down-
milling, the upsetting rate Gu - increases exponentially. The effective clearance angle, 
plotted in Figure 4-17, has been calculated and determined experimentally in accord-

Microstructuring by means of cutting processes 
49 
ance to [KRO69]. During up-milling, this angle is located in the entry area, whereas 
during down-milling, it can be found in the exit area of the cutting edge. In the case of 
smaller revolution ratios, the effective clearance angle decreases exponentially to 
Deff = 4.4 ° at On = 10. The tool clearance angle D = 7 ° is thus reduced by 2.6 °max.  
 
Figure 4-17:  Influence of the revolution ratio on stretching/compression of the cut and on a re-
duced clearance angle for up- and down-milling 
During up-milling, cutting speeds and feed rates opposing each other result in a 
stretching of the cut. The trajectory is thus flatter in the exit area of the cutting edge. 

50 
Microstructuring by means of cutting processes 
As a consequence, the trajectory approaches the rear clearance surface edge of the 
cutting edge similarly accompanied by a reduced effective clearance angle. During 
down-milling, however, cutting speeds and feed rates of the same direction result in a 
compression of the cut. Indeed, tKHFXWWLQJHGJHHQWHUVLQWRWKHFRPSRQHQW¶VVXUIDFH 
at a steep angle, but here too, the trajectory of the rear clearance surface edge ap-
proaches the clearance surface of the cutting edge with increasing compression, re-
ducing the effective clearance angle. The clearance angle, which is exponentially re-
duced with smaller revolution ratios, correlates with those of the stretching rate Gs 
and the upsetting rate Gu. Thus, based on this easily determined parameter, a predic-
tion concerning the clearance angle reduction can be made.  
For high-quality machining of micro-dimples, cutting speeds larger than 120 m/min 
are suitable (Figure 4-8). From tribological viewpoint, the tangential distance between 
two micro-dimples should be minimal. As a consequence, larger revolution ratios are 
required, thus, avoiding critical contact conditions between tool and component dur-
ing the machining of cylinder liners. For the respective depth of cut in the range from 
ap = 0 μm to 40 μm, the clearance angle is only reduced by 0.4 ° and is therefore not 
discussed in this context.  
Geometrical kinematic parameters influencing micro dimple geometry 
Besides the kinematic parameters, the tool trajectory radius rtool and the component 
diameter D influence the effective clearance angle as well. Using the up-milling pro-
cess as an example (Figure 4-18), the effective clearance angle calculated for revolu-
tion ratios from On = 10 to 160 is plotted against the tool trajectory radius 
(rtool = 10.15 mm to 41.00 mm) and the component diameter (D = 20.3 to 83.00 mm).  
With smaller tool trajectory radii, an exponential non-negligible reduction of the effec-
tive clearance angle Deff can be observed. This can be explained by the fact that for 
smaller tool trajectory radii, the tool cutting edge enters and exits the component at a 
steeper angle. Thus, when the cut is stretched or compressed, the generated surface 
approaches the rear clearance surface of the edge, accompanied by a reduced effec-
tive clearance angle. With smaller revolution ratios, the effective clearance angle is 
linearly more and more reduced, depending on the increasing component diameter. 
With constant revolution ratios, increasing diameters here result in larger tangential 
feeds, i.e., in a reduced revolution ratio (see Figure 4-17). If the revolution ratio is 
changed, and the tangential feed remains constant, the component diameter does 
not have any influence on the effective clearance angle.  
To determine interactions ZLWKWKHFRPSRQHQW¶VPDFURJHRPHWU\in this case - the 
surface curvature, scratch tests were carried out at concave and convex components 
with diameters from D = 10 mm to 80 mm, and machining forces as well as burr and 
chip formation were analysed. The maximum forces which, according to Figure 4-7, 
can be found in the middle of a micro dimple are not affected by the component¶V 
curvature. In the entry and exit areas of the cutting edge, in particular, no differences 
can be identified between the machined surface topography and the burr dimensions. 

Microstructuring by means of cutting processes 
51 
The surface curvature merely affects the entrance and exit angle as well as the 
length of cut. This is shown in Figure 4-18, middle, where the measured topographic 
images of internally structured surfaces with diameters of D = 80 mm and D = 20 mm 
are compared. With smaller component diameters, tool trajectory radius and compo-
nent radius approximate each other. As a result, the cutting edge enters the surface 
earlier and flatter and exits it later and flatter. When machining convex surfaces, this 
correlation is just the opposite. The flatter angles during the entry and the exit of the 
cutting edge are also reflected by the force signal and the chip formation along the 
cut; however, they have no influence on the micro dimple quality, as already men-
tioned above.

ponent diameter for machining of inner surfaces 
Load- and speed-specific structuring of cylinder liners 
As the tribological stress (load, sliding speed) varies along the height of a cylinder 
liner, it is necessary to locally adjust the surface parameters by means of the micro-
dimples. As summarised in Figure 4-19, the process developed for inner structuring 
of cylindrical components offers several adjustment possibilities.  

52 
Microstructuring by means of cutting processes 
 
Figure 4-19:  Variables for local load-specific cutting of micro-dimples  
First, the area to be machined, e.g. the top and bottom dead centre area or the hy-
drodynamic area, can be flexibly specified (Figure 4-19 a). As already explained in 
the preceding chapter, the revolution ratio can be used to adjust the micro-dimple dis-
tance and arrangement in peripheral direction. Similarly, the axial feed fax can be 
used to adjust the micro-dimple distance in axial height direction (Figure 4-19 b). Mi-
cro-dimple geometry and dimensions (Figure 4-19 c) can however also be used to 
realise a local and variable functionalisation of the cylinder liner by selecting the re-
spective process (down-milling/up-milling), the tool feed, and the cross-section ge-
ometry of the cutting edge. The tribological performance of load-specific structured 
surfaces is explained in detail in Chapter 7.  
Microstructuring tools for machining of cylinder liners 
When measuring the form of cylinder liners to be machined and honed for testing 
them on a test rig within the scope of the subprojects 1 (IMK) and 5 (ITV), out-of-
roundness and deviations from their cylindrical form of up to 18 μm were measured. 
These resulted in considerable deviations of the depth of micro-dimples along the cyl-
inder liner circumference. To compensate the deviations in form and position, the mi-
crostructuring tool presented in Figure 4-20 was developed.  
The function principle is as follows: A rolling bearing (Pos. 2) placed into the tip of a 
rotating tool shank rests on the surface of a rotating component. Together with the 
bearing and located closely behind it, a cutting edge (Pos. 3) rotating with the tool 

Microstructuring by means of cutting processes 
53 
shank (Pos. 10) follows the surface contour. As a result, the specified depth of cut 
remains constant despite the form and position tolerances of the surface contour. 
The depth of cut can be continuously adjusted by an eccentric on the tool shank from 
ap = 0 to 200 μm via a worm drive (Pos. 6+7).  
 
Figure 4-20:  Structure and functioning of the tool concept developed for compensating deviations 
in form and position 
To verify the potential of an elastic tool, its dynamic compensation quality when ma-
chining components whose form is not round was determined experimentally (Figure 
4-21). In the following, WKHGHIOHFWLRQYDU\LQJDORQJWKHFRPSRQHQW¶VFLUFXPIHUHQFHLV
called dynamic tool deflection sv,dyn. To determine the compensation quality, the 
components clamped into a three-jaw chuck are machined with a defined eccentricity 
of 250 μm by means of the elastic tool after pre-turning. The component rotates with 
n = 38 min-1. With a minimum deflection of 150 μm, a depth of cut of ap = 8.3 μm is 
set first. The maximum depth of cut is measured at three axial positions along the 
whole circumference of the component. Figure 4-21 compares the eccentricity meas-

the selected dynamic tool deflection sv,dyn = 250 μm, the depth of cut varies from ap = 
8.2 μm to 13.9 μm. Compared to the dynamic tool deflection of the tool head, the dy-
namic error of depth of cut of ǻap = 5.7 μm is equal to a residual error of depth of cut 
of 2.3 %. The tool revolution speed which varies from ntool = 250 1/min to 6000 1/min 
has no influence on the specified depth of cut.

Creation of hybrid cylinder liners 
Apart from honing, a number of methods for machining cylinder liners were examined 
within the scope of this research project from a tribological viewpoint. Among others, 
these methods were also combined with machined micro-dimples, resulting in the 
creation of hybrid cylinder liners.  
To gather basic experiences concerning the interactions between the pre-machined 
surfaces and the microstructuring process, an average surface roughness ranging 
from Rz = 0,1 μm to 5,2 μm was provided by means of grinding and milling process-
es. Furthermore, micro-dimples were cut in parallel, diagonal and orthogonal ar-
rangement into the surface texture. In the case of the surface roughness being simi-
lar to the micro-dimple depth, an overlapping of the microstructuring with the surface 
roughness and its arrangement becomes evident. This is in particular the case when 
considering the cutting force characteristics, since large surface roughness results in 
distinct local deviations of the machined cross-sectional area and the width of con-
tact. However, no influence of the initial topography on the machined surface topog-
raphy, the burr dimensions, RUWKHFRPSRQHQW¶VVXEVXUIDFHFRXOG be observed. In this 
regard, there are no interactions between the microstructuring process and a pre-
machined surface.  
In order to determine the tribological interactions between the initial surface and the 
micro-dimples, cylinder liners to be tested on a driven single cylinder liner test rig 

Microstructuring by means of cutting processes 
55 
(see Chapter 7.3) were pre-machined by means of different mechanical methods. 
Moreover, micro-dimples with uniform parameters (U profile, ap,max = 7 μm, 
sax = 0.3 mm, stan = 1.5 mm) were cut into their dead centre area along an axial 
height of 50 mm. All cylinder liners were made of GJL250 lamellar cast iron from one 
single material batch. Figure 4-22 compares the ³hybrid´ surfaces with regards to the 
surface roughness coefficients Sa as well as with regards to their SEM images. For 
this purpose, finely honed (a), normally honed (b), cylindrical ground (c) and turned 
(d, e) cylinder liners were structured. In addition, finely honed cylinder liners with 
thermally sprayed Fe50Mo coating were structured (f).  
 
Figure 4-22:  Hybrid cylinder liners  
Similarly to GJS400 globular cast iron examined in Chapter 4.3, material separation 
was locally interrupted by phase transitions and inclusions when machining micro-
dimples. The topography of machined surfaces shows open graphite lamellas. SEM 
images and micrographs show plastically deformed subsurface areas as well as open 
graphite lamellas. These are interrupted in the transition areas between graphite 
pores, ferrite seams and basic pearlitic matrix due to their different mechanical phase 
properties. Consequently, they are also partially separated from the surface in these 
areas. Depending on the pre-machining method, no influence on the subsurface 

56 
Microstructuring by means of cutting processes 
could be verified. Apart from their overlapping with the surface roughness, no interac-
tions with the microstructuring could be observed.  
The cylinder liners were tribologically examined on a single cylinder test rig before 
and after machining of micro-dimples; this is discussed in depth in Chapter 7.37.3. 
4.5 Conclusion 
In this report, parameters influencing the high quality machining of micro-dimples are 
presented. Small cutting speeds, negative rake angles as well as rounded cutting 
edges encourage ploughing effects which result in chipping and contour deviations. 
Due to a larger chip compression ratio, the lateral material flow ahead of the cutting 
edge towards the free edges is increased, leading to larger burr dimensions. Besides 
the material properties, a major parameter influencing the burr dimensions is the ef-
fective tool cutting edge angle. Due to a smaller material volume and a stronger ma-
terial deflection, small tool cutting edge angles work against burr formation. If small 
effective tool cutting edge angles cannot be realised, burr formation can be avoided 
by use of positive inclination angles. Apart from S235JR steel, other materials used 
for cylinder liners, such as GJS400 and Fe50Mo were examined, and their interac-
tions with microstructuring were analysed. The material GJS400 shows a ductile ma-
terial separation which is comparable to the one of steel. For thermally sprayed 
Fe50Mo coatings, material separation is caused by cohesive failure in the boundary 
areas of the sprayed lamella.  
Additionally, a process strategy for load-specific machining of micro-dimples into the 
inner surfaces of cylindrical components was developed and analysed. By systematic 
variation of the process variables, their influence on the arrangement and geometry 
of micro-dimples when machining inner surfaces of cylindrical components was de-
scribed, and process limits could be identified. Tool geometries used so far when 
machining plane surfaces can be transferred to process strategies for machining cy-
lindrical ones. In process design, it must however be considered that for up- and 
down-milling, certain process parameter combinations lead to a considerable distor-
tion of the respective tool trajectory. Depending on the processing type, this can be 
accompanied by either stretching or compression of the cut. In both cases however, 
the effective clearance angle is considerably reduced which cannot be disregarded. 
Within the scope of this joint research project, the developed methods and gathered 
experiences made were applied to machining of a large number of cylinder liners 
whose tribological potential is described in Chapter 7. Besides load-specific micro-
structuring, hybrid cylinder liners were created as well. In this case, no interactions of 
the microstructuring process with the cylinder liners, which had been pre-machined 
by means of different manufacturing methods, could be observed.  
In order to compensate deviations in form and position, an elastic microstructuring 
tool resting against the surface of the component to be machined was developed and 
characterised with regards to its performance characteristics. With the help of this 
tool system, deviations in form and position could be compensated up to 97 %. Con-

sequently, this allows for the microstructuring process with its narrow tolerances to be 
transferred to and integrated within the conventional machine tools and procedures.

5.1 Objective  
The aim of this project was the development and research of thermally sprayed coat-
ings with friction reducing micro-dimples. The basis for this approach was the sys-
tematic variation of the spray parameters. To achieve this objective, the following 
subtopics were studied: 
x The relationship between the spray parameters and the layer structure 
x Investigations of pore density and pore morphology 
x Use of pores as dimples for reducing friction and oil consumption 
For this purpose, the spray parameters which influence the degree of melting and ac-
celeration of the spray particles, i.e., their kinetic energy on impacting the substrate, 
were varied. In particular, the hydrogen content in the process gas and the applied 
current show a strong influence as process variables. The spray distance has mainly 
effect on the kinetic energies during the impact of the particles on the substrate and 
the oxidation of particles in the process. To obtain insights into the relationship be-
tween surfaces and spray parameters, a detailed optical characterisation of the sur-
face had to be carried out. 
First, adequate materials suitable for applications with high frictions and wear had to 
be chosen as feedstock powders for spray coatings. Furthermore, each material had 
to be characterised in depth, and consequently, its influence on the spray parameters 
- investigated. Therefore, a close association with the Project 4 "Structure-based sur-
face characterisation based on optical measurement technology" in terms of analysis 
of process parameters was necessary. The analysis of pore density, pore depth and 
average pore size provided essential knowledge concerning the evaluation of micro-
dimples in thermal spray coatings.  
Second, the previously used plasma-spray process had to be transferred to an inter-
nal coating process. It was particularly important to use the knowledge of the coating 
structure, which has been produced with a powerful torch to adapt to the reduced 
performance of an inner burner. Additionally, it was necessary to consider the lower 
heat dissipation because an insufficient cooling might influence the layer morphology. 
The coating of cylindrical components also had to be done on a nearly stress-free 
mounting on a rotary table so that the components had no distortion after spray. 
5.2 Experimental  
The aim of this study was the development of a novel procedure which allows control 
over the dimple-structures of thermal spray coatings (i.e., their distribution, geometry, 
and density). Special focus was put on the development of optimal dimple sizes for 
the layer structure of such coatings as a function of the hydrodynamic loads. The var-

ious possibilities to influence the dimple volumes by means of suitable process con-
trol were studied as well. Consequently, coatings of selected material systems were 
applied to the outer contours of rotationally symmetric components. To analyse the 
correlations between spray parameters and coating structure, cast iron substrates 
were coated differently with the conventional, powerful plasma torch F4 MB (Sulzer 
Metco, Wohlen/Switzerland). The material specific coatings were analysed in detail, 
and the factors which influence formation of pores were examined. In the second 
phase of the study, the experimental results were transferred to an internal coating 
process, and possible adjustments of the material system were investigated.   
The formation of pores, in terms of microstructures, occurs when unmelted or resolid-
ified spray particles are incorporated into lamellar composite particles. A variation of 
the current strength and a variation of the gas flow - in particular the hydrogen con-
tent - affects the input of heat to the spray particles. The heat input determines the 
degree of partial melting of the spray particles. If the particles are melted too strongly 
and accelerated too fast into the substrate, the drops nearly burst when impacting the 
substrate and form microporous layers with less cohesion. A too low particle temper-
ature and acceleration result in a pasty character of the particles and a porous layer 
structure, since the slats cannot be applied directly above each other. Within a ther-
mal coating, various areas can appear: areas, where the speed and the temperature 
of the particles have been either too high or too low; as well as areas, where the par-
ticles have had the optimum speed and temperature. However, not only the heat in-
put but also the kinetics of the spray particles were influenced by the current and gas 
flow. The particles which were exposed to a low heat input tended to a low degree of 
melting, while particles which were exposed to low kinetic energies tended to solidify 
during the flight phase. The particles were incorporated as spherical particles in the 
coating (see Figure 5-1).

and in a FeCr13/Mo coating (right) 
The unmelted coatings and the spray particles resolidified during the flight phase can 
be identified depending on the spray parameters. The powder feed also has an influ-
ence on the layer structure; namely, the powder feed has to be increased or de-
creased depending on the performance of the plasma particle flow in order to get

homogeneous dense layers. In this study, the powder feed was kept constant. Figure 
5-1 (left) shows scanning electron (SEM) micrographs of a MoNiCrBSi coating with 
unmelted spray particles. Figure 5-1 (right) shows a FeCr13/Mo coating with resolidi-
fied spray particles, which are characterised by an oxide margin. 
In general, the particles can consist of all the materials used; however, the melting 
and resolidification of particles depend on the melting temperature and the heat ca-
pacity. Figure 5-2 shows schematically the setting of the atmospheric plasma spray 
process (APS) and its influencing factors. In this study, the parameters marked in red 
and their effects on the layer structure and the formation of microstructures in terms 
of pores were investigated.

In the following, the consequences of varying the process parameters for each spray 
material are discussed. 
5.3 Outer coating of rotationally symmetric components 
Spray material Fe/Mo 50-50 
As a potential spray material for the application of thermo-mechanically highly 
stressed surfaces, a pseudo-mixture of iron and molybdenum was used. Previously, 
molybdenum-containing coatings have shown promising friction reducing results 
when applied to coated cylinder bearing surfaces and piston rings [FLO03, SCO75]. 
Pure molybdenum powder shows high hardness which can be increased by means of 
thermal spray process at atmosphere. The formation of molybdenum oxides leads to 
a significant increase in hardness, which is required for the running properties of cyl-
inder-piston bearing [OVE79, LEE90, NIR10]. However, machining (e.g. honing) of 

Microstructured thermally sprayed surfaces 
61 
pure molybdenum coatings is a complicated and expensive process. Mixing molyb-
denum with ductile phases facilitates the machining process and lowers its costs. 
Thus, in the first part of this study, molybdenum was mixed with iron which was in-
tended to serve as a matrix for the hard phases of molybdenum. As an alloying ele-
ment for steel, the addition of molybdenum increases the hardness and corrosion re-
sistance. As a result, the sprayed coating exhibits not only pure phases of molyb-
denum and iron but also mixed phases, which lead to an increase of hardness and 
corrosion resistance. The iron tends to scale under high temperature conditions in 
oxygen atmosphere. At best, this can produce iron oxides such as wustite (Fe1-xO), 
which is characterised by solid lubricant properties similar to those of graphite 
[BAR05,VEN09]. Molybdenum exhibits a higher melting point and a higher heat ca-
pacity than iron. Therefore, the proportion of non-melted and especially resolidified 
particles increased or decreased by varying the heat input through different current 
strengths and gas flows, which is accompanied with an increase or decrease of 
pores. 
Table 5-1 below provides extensive material characterisation of the various iron-
molybdenum coatings (Fe/Mo) used in the course of this study together with their 
spray parameters.

Figure 5-3 shows scanning electron micrographs of starting powders for Fe/Mo-
sprayed coatings. Two powder mixtures containing 50 wt.-% iron and 50 wt.-% mo-
lybdenum in the fractions -45+20 μm and -90+45 μm can be seen. The large spheri-
cal particles shown in Figure 5-3, left, are agglomerated and sintered molybdenum 
particles. The morphology of the particles determines the melting properties of mo-
lybdenum. The agglomerated molybdenum particles provide a large surface/volume-
ratio and can therefore melt well. The smaller irregular particles represent the iron 
powder.

Figure 5-4 shows three polished cross-sections of Fe/Mo-coatings, which were 
sprayed with the conventional plasma torch SM F4 MB. Two different spray parame-
ter sets were used to investigate the influence of a high or a low energy input on the 
formation of pores. Sample 1-09 (Figure 5-4, left) combines a high spray distance 
(130 mm) with a high energy input (630 A, 14 NLPM H2). A homogeneous layered 
two-phase system can be seen, in which single macro-pores appear. The bright 
phase represents the molybdenum, and the dark phase - the iron. For the 1-03 sam-
ple (Figure 5-4, centre) a high spray distance was used (130 mm) in combination with 
a low energy input (550 A, 11 NLPM H2). Similarly, a homogeneous structure of iron 
and molybdenum can be seen. Additionally, some particles often show substantially 
more pronounced oxide films. The proportion of spherical particles, which are charac-
teristic of unmelted and resolidified particles, is comparatively higher. As a result, this 
sample exhibits a higher proportion of larger pores. 
Figure 5-4: Polished cross-sections of Fe/Mo 1-09 (left), 1-03 (middle) und 1-01 (right) 
Samples 1-03 and 1-01 represent a comparison between the same energy inputs 
used with different spray distances. Sample 1-01 (Figure 5-4, right) was sprayed from 
a spray distance of 90 mm and the sample 1-03 (Figure 5-4, centre) was sprayed 
from a distance of 130 mm. The development of the microstructure is similar for both 
samples; however, the layer application of the sample with the short spray distance is 
about 15 % higher. 
Based on the cross-sections of Fe/Mo, initial conclusions about the material and its 
dependence on the varying spray distances can be made. Following, micro-sections 
of the top surface from Fe/Mo are shown, because this is the relevant surface for this 
research approach. The coatings differ in the morphology of their micro- and cross-
sections due to the difference in their mechanical processing, i.e., grinding and pol-
ishing.

The micro-sections support the conclusions which were gained from the cross-
sections: namely, that the porosity in this coating material can be influenced by the 
energy input. Surface parameters such as porosity were investigated by subproject 4

The measured porosities are within a narrow range of between 1 and 3%. This value 
is typical for thermally spray coatings as residual porosity. Despite reduced energy 
input, the F4 MB torch was too powerful which resulted in a higher porosity. There-
fore, a strategy had to be developed to reduce the input of energy to the particles. In 
the first experimental setup, the current of the plasma torch was varied from 550 to 
630 A. For the second series of experiments, a wider interval for the current rating 
and the gas flow was selected. The Taguchi L9 experimental design [TAG86] was 
used in order to obtain a manageable amount of samples and to vary the process pa-
rameters spray distance, current and process gas flow. This resulted in the following 
set of parameters:

SEM-micrographs (Figure 5-6) using backscattered electron (BSE) contrast allow for 
an exact assignment of the iron and molybdenum particles. Because of the higher 
atomic weight of molybdenum, it appears brighter in the micrograph than the lighter 
iron. In the following Figure 5-6, BSE images of the samples 2-01, 2-07, and 2-08 are 
shown. It can be seen that the coatings consist largely of a homogeneous mixture of 
the two phases, wherein in sample 2-01 the mixture of the lamellae is more homoge-
nous.

(right) 
Sample 2-08 (Figure 5-6 middle), which was coated from a greater spray distance, is 
characterised by a high content of spherical particles. These particles can be classi-
fied as molybdenum in many cases, which is an indication that the molybdenum par-
ticles are resolidified during the flight due to the high melting point. However, the par-
ticles are well embedded in the layered particles and do not form the starting point for 
pores. A micrograph of specimen 2-07 at higher magnification (Figure 5-6, right) 
shows that the molybdenum particles are often characterised by cracks and frac-
tures. This reveals the brittle character of the sprayed molybdenum, especially of mo-
lybdenum oxide, which is responsible for the high hardness of the coatings. The 
cracks may occur, on the one hand, when the brittle molybdenum impacts the sur-
face and, on the other, when the particles are cooled too rapidly on impacting the

surface. The measured porosities are in a range similar to the one seen in the first 
series of samples. It can be concluded that the energy input is still very high and the 
coatings are densely sprayed.

An element mapping was made by means of an electron microprobe (EPMA); once 
again, a clear separation of the two phases, which did not generate mixed phases 
even though they were mixed, could be observed. For each element, one mapping is 
shown, wherein the colour spectrum represents the accumulation of an element. A 
strong oxidation occurring mainly in the regions of the iron phase could be observed 
(cf. the oxygen mapping in the right field of Figure 5-8).

The phase composition of the coatings was determined by means of X-ray diffraction 
(XRD). Diffractograms of two of the samples can be seen in Figure 5-9, and within,

can be detected. The content of wustite differs for the different Fe/Mo coatings. The 
highest content of wustite was found in the sample 2-08, which was sprayed from a 
high spray distance. A semi-quantitative phase analysis determined that the wustite 
content was approximately 5 wt.-% of the complete mixture; however, this analysis 
lacks accuracy due to the low intensities of the wustite peaks. In addition, the diffrac-
tion patterns show evidence of other iron oxides such as hematite (Fe2O3). The 
amount of these oxides could not be quantified because the peak positions were dif-
ficult to determine. Sample 2-01, which was sprayed from a short distance, also 
shows iron oxide phases similar to those in sample 2-08; these, however, cannot be 
determined as clearly as in sample 2-08. It can be assumed that the main phase of 
the iron oxides is also wustite, but other oxides such as hematite might also occur. 
 
 
Figure 5-9: X-ray profiles of Fe/Mo coatings. Sample 2-01 (left) and sample 2-08 (right) 
A dependence on the spray distance can be detected; it appears that prolonged flight 
time of the particles leads to a better mixing with oxygen. In contrast, XRD patterns of 
the starting powder do not show an evidence of oxides, which leads to the assump-
tion that the low contents of individual oxides in the spray powder material cannot be 
detected by XRD. 
Analysis with a confocal laser microscope indicates that the Fe/Mo coatings have 
significant relief differences. Figure 5-10 (middle) shows a height image of the sam-
ple 2-03. It can be seen that one of the two phases is set back after the grinding and 
polishing process. Secondary electron images (SE-image) with a scanning electron 
microscope show also reliefs between the two different phases. The material contrast 
from the SE images reveals that set-back phase is iron which exhibits lower hardness 
than molybdenum and is therefore eroded during the grinding process. Consequent-
ly, it can be concluded that during tribological load the bearing ratio of the layer is 
largely determined by the molybdenum phase.

Micro-hardness testing was performed on cross-sections of some of the Fe/Mo coat-
ings. Before testing the layers, measurement uncertainties were assessed by meas-
uring a hardness test block. On each measured layer, 10 hardness impressions were 
set with a diamond pyramid (Vickers hardness). The results were processed by 
means of a statistical analysis and corrected. The results are shown in the following

in comparison to an uncoated reference sample made of steel, and especially at

Their advantageous tribological properties notwithstanding, the coatings are charac-
terised by low corrosion stability. After a short time, they react with atmospheric oxy-
gen and their iron phase is oxidised to hematite (see Figure 5-11). Consequently, 
molybdenum-containing coatings in combination with pure iron are limited for the ap-
plication on cylinder liners only: Condensates such as formic acid and sulfuric acid 
may in the combustion chamber occur as a result from the combustion process and 
attack the layer system [FLO03]. Corrosion particles increase the friction between the 
liner surface and the piston.

Spray material FeCr13 
Another potential spray material investigated in the course of this study was a high-
alloy ferritic steel material with a chromium content of about 13 wt.-% (henceforth ab-
breviated as FeCr13). In comparison to the Fe/Mo coatings, FeCr13 is characterised 
by its homogenous distribution in the coating, as the chromium is finely dispersed 
and the material consists of a single phase. Passivation of the chromium content is 
sufficiently high to ensure an adequate corrosion resistance to air and aqueous solu-
tions and in applications under high temperature and oxygen presence. Similarly to 
molybdenum, chromium forms oxide during the spraying process, which can signifi-
cantly increase the hardness of the sprayed material. The high corrosion stability 
strongly reduces the formation of abrasive iron oxides such as hematite (Fe2O3), but 
also the formation of the solid lubricant wustite (Fe1-xO). The slightly lower hardness 
of FeCr13 and the uniform distribution of chromium allow good mechanical machining 
of the material. The control of the formation of pores based on the variation of the 
process parameters is more difficult in this material because the melting of the parti-
cles is more similar than between molybdenum and iron particles. As a result, the 
degree of melting and the kinetics of the particles can be determined only by the frac-
tion interval of the powder. 
The following paragraphs provide extensive material characterisation of the chromi-
um based steel coatings (FeCr13).

The starting powder for FeCr13 coatings is shown in Figure 5-12. Two powder frac-
tions were examined and one selected for the spray process. The powder fractions 
were -20+45 μm (Figure 5-12, left) and -25+5 μm (Figure 5-12, middle). The irregular 
shape of the spray particles resulted in a better melting of the chromium steel. It was 
therefore estimated that the process parameters would need lower energy inputs in 
comparison to the Fe/Mo-powder. Since the hydrogen content influences the energy 
input greatly, only the spray distance and the hydrogen flow rate were varied for the 
FeCr13 material. In comparison to the Fe/Mo coatings, the spray distance was in-
creased to increase the number of resolidified particles and, consequently, the num-
ber of pores. The compositions of the two powder fractions are equal.

Polished cross-sections of FeCr13 coatings (Figure 5-13) show the same depend-
ence on the heat input as for the Fe/Mo coatings. Sample 1-05 (125 mm and 8 
NLPM) exhibits a dense lamellar structure with isolated macropores and strong oxi-
dation (Figure 5-13 left). Sample 1-02 (125 mm and 6 NLPM), which was sprayed 
with lower energy, is characterised by a higher percentage of pores (Figure 5-13, 
centre). In addition, the coating is more strongly oxidised. Sample 1-02 (125 mm) and 
1-03 (140 mm) were compared when investigating the properties of coatings the 
same energy input, but varied spray distances. The coating structure and the applica-

70

tion process was almost the same for both samples, but the sample with higher spray 
distance oxidised stronger.

For the analysis of the surface, micro-sections were also characterized with white 
light interferometry. The results show that the porosity interval is higher than the one 
of Fe/Mo coatings. The highest porosity was measured for sample 1-03, which was 
sprayed with low hydrogen flow and from a high spray distance. However, the sample 
shows a high standard deviation so that it must be assumed that the porosity interval 
of this series is similar to the Fe/Mo coatings.

To allow for a comparison of the tribological characteristics of the FeCr13- and Fe/Mo 
coatings, a further series of FeCr13-samples were sprayed in accordance with the 
Taguchi L9 experimental design listed in table 5-3. 
Polished cross-sections were used to investigate the microstructure of the individual 
coatings. For this purpose, in addition to optical microscopy images, SEM micro-
graphs recorded in BSE mode and height images obtained by confocal laser micros-
copy were analysed to obtain additional information on the phase composition and 
topography of the coating. 
 
 
 
Figure 5-14:  SEM micrographs of FeCr13 coatings 2-02 (left), 2-03 (middle) und 2-08 (right). 
The SEM images (Figure 5-14) show three microstructures whose surfaces differ de-
pending on the various process parameters with which the layers were sprayed. The 
two samples 2-02 and 2-03, which were sprayed from a distance of 90 mm, are char-
acterised by nearly the same porosity and number of spherical particles. However, 
sample 2-03 shows a significantly higher oxidation: oxide films can be detected on 

Microstructured thermally sprayed surfaces

non-melted and re-solidified particles, in particular. Since this sample was sprayed 
with a higher heat input, it can be assumed that the particles were strongly melted 
and required a longer cooling time on the substrate; consequently, they were ex-
posed to the oxidising atmosphere while in their melted state for a long time. In com-
parison, sample 2-08, which was sprayed from a distance of 150 mm, exhibits a 
higher proportion of resolidified particles as well as a higher porosity. This sample did 
not oxidise as much as sample 2-03; however, some particles show oxide rims with a 
thickness of up to 4 μm, which exhibit cracks indicating their brittle character. 
Porosities of the individual coatings are summarised in the table below. The results 
reveals that the material FeCr13 tends to show lower material porosity. Due to the 
nearly homogeneous powder, the particles were molten in dependence on their size 
only. The location and time of contact between powder particles and plasma in the 
gas stream are important for different powder melting. Lower amounts of non-melted 
and re-solidified particles are the result.

Figure 5-15: Comparison of series 1 and 2 of FeCr13 coatings 
Analysis with the electron microprobe shows a homogeneous distribution of elements 
within the FeCr13-material (Figure 5-16). By and large, chromium is dissolved uni-
formly in the steel, but small precipitates of chromium are also found in the coating. 
The few grey areas in the BSE image represent the oxidised particles (cf. the ele-
mental map for oxygen). In these areas, the chromium content is increased, too. This 
indicates that chromium precipitates were oxidised during the flight phase. The oxi-
dised chromium provides for the high corrosion resistance and increased hardness.

Figure 5-16:  Element mapping of a FeCr13 coating by means of electron microprobe 
The analysis of the phase composition shows mainly a single-phase ferritic stainless 
steel (Figure 5-17). Furthermore, the profiles also reveal iron oxides which were pro-
duced during the spray process. The strong oxidation of the material can be seen in 
the micrographs. The qualitative phase analysis concerning the peak positions at 30

nonetheless, it is also possible that an iron-chromium oxide, namely chromite 
(FeCr2O4), is present as well. The appearance of chromium oxides is also supported 
by the oxygen distribution in the element mapping, which shows the accumulation of 
oxygen in the chromium rich areas. FeCr13 coatings, similar to Fe/Mo coatings, ex-
hibit higher oxide content in samples which were coated from a longer spray distance 
than in those from a short spray distance. 
Figure 5-17:  XRD profile of the FeCr13-powder (left) and the sample 2-08 (right) 
The XRD profiles provide evidence of the presence of the iron oxide wustite; still, 
magnetite and chromite appear to be the prevalent oxide phases. Magnetite is at-
tributed solid lubricant properties, which - though similar to those of wustite - are not 
as pronounced [Ven09]. The starting powder (Figure 5-17 left) shows no evidence of 
iron oxides. 
Due to the single-phase composition of the FeCr13 material, there are no strong dif-
ferences in hardness in between the coatings; thus, no relief formation can be ob-
served during mechanical processing such as grinding. Figure 5-18 shows images of 
FeCr13-02 made with a confocal laser microscope. It can be seen that the coating 

Microstructured thermally sprayed surfaces

exhibits a flat surface without substantial differences in height between the individual 
spray lamellae.

As with the Fe/Mo coatings, micro-hardness testing was also performed for the 
FeCr13 coatings. In each coating, 10 hardness indentations were set with a diamond 
pyramid (Vickers hardness). The values reveal that FeCr13- are characterised by 
higher hardness than the Fe/Mo coatings. This fact can be explained with the homo-
geneous structure of the single-phase FeCr13. The high proportions of iron in the 
Fe/Mo coatings lead not only to local hardness reduction but also to an increase of 
porosity. Moreover, FeCr13 coatings are partially strongly oxidised so that a high 
proportion of hard oxides increases the hardness.

synthetic oil (0W30). Similarly to the Fe/Mo coatings, the FeCr13 coatings show im-
proved tribological properties when compared to an uncoated reference sample. 
However, the reference sample does show an equal or lower coefficient of friction in 
the hydrodynamic region for low contact pressures of 1.25 MPa and oil temperatures 
of 120 °C. A detailed description of the tribological testings can be found in chapter 7

might also have occurred in some cases. Examining the contact area of the two fric-
tion partners reveals friction welding due to the high chromium content. The "pin-on-
disc" setup of the tribological tests cannot completely reproduce the running motion 
of the piston ring on the cylinder surface, as it is a point contact instead of a line con-
tact. Nevertheless, the friction welding behaviour of the two friction partners in the 
cylinder could be similar to the results from the tribological tests. 
Conversely, the FeCr13 material shows high corrosion stability due to its high chro-
mium content, making it suitable for use in the combustion chamber.

5.4 Inner coating of rotationally symmetric components 
For the internal coating by means of atmospheric plasma spraying, it was necessary 
to use a burner with a nozzle which operates at 90 ° to the burner shank. 
In addition, due to the limited workspace, the coatings had to be applied with lower 
power and a smaller plasma jet. For this reason, the SM-F210 plasma torch from 
Sulzer Metco was used. The torch is designed for use on complex geometries and in 
boreholes. Since the output of this burner differs significantly from the output of the 
burner used for the outer contours, it was necessary to adjust the varying spray pa-
rameters during the first testing for the interior coatings. The Taguchi L9 experimental 
design was modified in the course of the first tests to study the influence of the pro-
cess parameters. Most noteworthy is the spray distance which was limited due to the 
maximum diameter of the coated cylinders used as test specimens for the tribological 
tests. The test specimens for the rotational friction wear tests (RRV) were blanks with 
a final diameter of 83 mm after coating. Consequently, the maximum spray distance 
was chosen in such a way as to minimise the collision risk between the burner shank 
and the cylinder wall, whereas the minimum distance ensured that the plasma flame 
would not touch the cylinder wall. The current and the gas flow had to be adjusted so 
that the liner would not overheat, yet there would still be enough energy to melt the 
powder particles. As a result, the following test plan was formulated:

For the investigation of internally coated samples, initially flat samples were bound to 
a magnetic bearing (Figure 5-19). For an internal coating, either a special plasma 
torch or the component to be coated rotates, and the burner moves axially through 
the bore. In this case, the bearing rotated. The disadvantage of this experimental 
setup was the intermingling of powder particles after crossing the edge.

sample in a bearing (centre) and schematic coating process of a flat sample bound to magnet in a

Using the experimental setup shown above, two different spray materials were ap-
plied and tested afterwards. To produce application-near internal, coated flat sam-
ples, a sliding bearing structure was developed, and flat substrate and tribometer 
pins were integrated in its running surface (Figure 5-20). The advantage of this ex-
perimental setup was that the turbulence effects of the overspray near the edges 
were avoided. Moreover, the thermal evolution in the liner during the coating process 
was almost identical to the one in a real cylinder bore.

Spray material FeCr13 
The FeCr13 material, which had already been sprayed on outer contours and exam-
ined, was also used when investigating internally coated flat samples. For the pur-
pose of this investigation, the Taguchi L9 experimental design and an F210-plasma 
torch were utilised as well. 
The experiments on internally coated samples were primarily used for the transfer of 
the already received properties of this material. In comparison to the samples pro-
cessed with the conventional plasma torch F4, the cross-sections of the samples 

76 
Microstructured thermally sprayed surfaces 
sprayed with the F210-plasma torch from the same spray distance, but with different 
currents and gas flows, exhibit a much higher porosity. Here, the individual coatings 
differ strongly not only in the number of the pores but also in their size. Furthermore, 
a larger number of unmelted or resolidified particles as well as a lower oxidation of 
chromium can be observed. Sample 3-08 (Figure 5-21 right), which was sprayed 
from 55 mm spray distance and with 270 A current, is characterised by the highest 
amount of non-melted or re-solidified particles. The 270 A current and the high spray 
distance are not sufficient to melt the particles completely and, as a result, many of 
the particles remain unmelted or are only partially melted. Sample 3-03, which was 
sprayed with a much higher current, shows a much denser microstructure and less 
spherical particles. The cross-sections, shown in Figure 5-21, reveal increasing po-
rosity with decreasing current.

The analysis of metallographic micro-sections (Figure 5-22) shows the microstruc-
tures of the tribologically active area. Samples 3-07, 3-02 and 3-06, which were 
sprayed from the same spray distance (45 mm), are used as examples. The porosity 
of the samples also decreases with increasing current.

A marked difference is observed in the surface formation of the internal FeCr13 coat-
ings when compared with the surface formation of the external FeCr13 coatings. 
Thus, sample 3-06 is characterised by a strong degree of oxidisation, which is often 
associated with spherical particles. Furthermore, its pores are generally separated 
from each other and located in the immediate environment of oxidised or spherical 
particles. Sample 3-06, on the other hand, exhibits a higher porosity; its pores are 
partially connected, and partial pore clusters are observed as well. Overall, the coat-
ing cohesion seems less pronounced than in the FeCr13 outer contour coatings. For 
the analysis of the surface, pores were extracted and calculated from image files of

the micro-sections by means of digital image analysis. In comparison to the meas-
urements made with the white light interferometer, this method is less reliable due to 
the possibility of oxides or foreign particles with dark areas being recognised as 
pores. The data obtained are summarized in Table 7-12.

Hardness measurements on internally coated FeCr13-coating are significantly lower 
than those of externally sprayed coatings. These findings can be explained by the 
reduced adhesion of the particles due to the lower performance of the F210-torch. 
Nonetheless, the results of the hardness measurements also show a homogeneous 
hardness distribution, regardless of the porosity of the different FeCr13 coatings.  
 
Figure 5-24:  Comparison of series 2 and 3 of FeCr13 coatings 
Due to its tendency to friction welding with subsequent scuffing as well as due to the 
high oxidation susceptibility of chromium during spraying, the pure FeCr13-material is 
not suitable for the coating of cylinder liners.

Microstructured thermally sprayed surfaces 
Applying Fe/Mo-compounds to thermo-mechanically highly stressed surfaces proved 
advantageous even though the iron phase with its high susceptibility to corrosion was 
a major limitation. Consequently, for the future approach, iron was replaced by the 
already well-studied chromium steel FeCr13. Thus, the positive properties of both 
materials were combined as the total content of chromium in the layer was reduced, 
and the corrodible iron was replaced.

es indicated the areas used for element analysis (right) 
The powders used were similar to those of the first series of experiments. Figure 5-25 
provides SEM images (BSE mode) of FeCr13/Mo powder mixture whereby the bright 
spherical particles represent molybdenum, and the darker particles chromium steel, 
as confirmed by element analysis of the particles. Flat specimens were sprayed ac-
cording to the Taguchi L9 experimental plan and prepared for metallographic sec-
tions. In the polished micro-sections, the coatings were formed as a function of the 
spray distance and the currents. Here, the layers differed not only in the number of 
the pores but also in the morphology. Figure 5-26 shows three coatings which were 
sprayed with the same current but from different spray distances. Sample 4-08 (Fig-
ure 5-26, right) is characterised by widely-dispersed pores, whereas sample 4-06 
(Figure 5-26, middle) exhibits a distinct narrow pore size distribution.

In comparison to the Fe/Mo coatings, which were sprayed with the F4-torch, the 
FeCr13/Mo coatings also show significantly higher porosity level, which can be ex-
plained by the lower energy output of the F210-torch. 
To investigate the suitability of FeCr13/Mo as a potential coating material, micro 
hardness testing (HV 0.3) were performed on the cross-sections of the samples. The 
hardness of the material varied depending on the area of the sample. Since molyb-
denum is harder than stainless steel, local differences in hardness played a signifi-
cant role when determining the total hardness of the coating. 
 
Figure 5-27:  Comparison of Vickers hardness of FeCr13 and FeCr13/Mo 
Figure 5-27 shows that the FeCr13/Mo 50-50 mixture is harder than the previously 
used pure stainless steel. The addition of molybdenum during thermal spraying pro-
cess results in the formation of hard molybdenum oxides, which increases the hard-
ness of the coatings. A mechanical treatment remains possible, but the parameters 
for the feed and cut forces must be customised when honing, for example. 
A direct correlation between the spray parameters and the porosity could not be es-
tablished. Therefore, a new full factorial experimental design was created, wherein 
the spray distance and the current were varied while the gas flow was kept constant. 
This resulted in the following experimental plan:

An examination of the polished micro-sections revealed that the amount of resolidi-
fied particles increases with increased spray distance, and that the proportion of un-
melted particles increases for low currents. Hence, the majority of non-melted or 
resolidified particles can be observed in samples which were coated from a high 
spray distance and at low currents. Subsequently, porosities can be identified pri-
marily for these particles. The influence of the current on the pore formation of 
FeCr13/Mo layers is graphically represented in Figure 5-28; furthermore, the samples 
which were sprayed from a short distance show a significantly higher oxidation level.

Different surfaces parameters such as density and pore structure as a function of

The dependence of the porosity on the spray distance and current is shown in Figure 
5-29; only porosities covering an area larger than 200 μm² were considered, since 
this has resulted in a reasonable threshold. The porosity of the FeCr13/Mo coatings 
depends primarily on the current: the coating material tends to forms highly porous 
coatings at lower currents. Furthermore, the structure depth varies almost linearly 
with the porosity (Figure 5-29, right).

The coatings were also examined with respect to their element and phase composi-
tions as well as their surface hardness. An element mapping of an electron micro-
probe (EPMA) in Figure 5-30 shows results comparable to those of the Fe/Mo coat-
ings. The mapping reveals a two-phased structure, wherein the molybdenum and 
chromium steel phases are clearly separated. Even though some areas of the 
chrome steel are characterised by a higher amount of chromium, the chromium 
phase itself exhibits a level of oxidation similar to the one of the iron phase in the 
Fe/Mo coatings. In general, the FeCr13/Mo coatings have lower oxygen concentra-
tions, indicating higher corrosion stability.

Additionally, the individual coatings were measured by means of EDX analysis to de-
termine the element content and analyse whether the different spray parameters 
have an influence on the composition of the coatings. Three measurements were car-
ried out at different points on each coating. The individual element contents of the 
coatings as well as their standard deviation are shown in tables 5-15 and 5-16 on the

No systematic relationship between the spraying parameters and the composition of 
the individual coatings could be observed. The composition of the FeCr13/Mo coat-
ings is nearly constant between the individual coatings, meaning that selective evap-
oration of individual components could be excluded. Even though the level of oxygen 
in the coatings was also measured, the recorded values cannot be considered accu-
rate since they might also include the level of residual oxygen at the surface. The 
XRD patterns of the samples show representative peaks of molybdenum and steel as 
well as NiCr phases. The FeCr13/Mo coatings also reveal peaks of the iron oxide 
wustite (Fe1-xO) and molybdenum oxide (MO2) 
Micro-hardness tests (HV 0.3) of the cross-sections of the FeCr13/Mo coatings re-
vealed high average hardness of about 400 HV 0.3. With regards to the hardness, 
the surface relevant for tribological applications was examined as well. For this pur-
pose, a low-load hardness testing with a load of 29.42 N was used (HV 3). Experi-
ments with a higher load were chosen to obtain an average over the biphase, since 
the micro-hardness test of the biphasic character of the material revealed location-
dependent hardness differences.  
The values measured for the given micro-sections are listed in table 5-16. The stand-
ard deviations of the measurements were, as expected, very low.

In comparison to the micro-hardness of the cross-sections, a decrease of hardness 
was observed (Figure 5-31).

Similar to the porosity, the hardness results measured on micro-sections show a de-
pendence on the spray distance and amperage (Figure 5-32). For the hardness test-
ing, the resistance of the surface against the indentation of a load from an indentation 
object was measured; surfaces with high porosity and accompanied low layer cohe-

Microstructured thermally sprayed surfaces

Spray material Mo/NiCrBSi 75-25 
An additional material was investigated to validate the relationships between the 
spray parameters and the resulting surface formation. The selected material system 
was a self-fluxing nickel alloy with a high content of molybdenum. NiCrBSi coatings 
are often used in industrial applications where high wear resistance and high corro-
sion resistance are required. The single elements contribute their different properties 
to the coatings. Thermal spraying of nickel allows for an easy handling of the materi-
al; such coatings show moderate strength and corrosion resistance. The chromium 
phase increases the corrosion stability and can increase the hardness due to the 
formation of hard phases. Boron reduces the melting point, while the silicon phase 
promotes the self-fluxing properties. To use this material for surfaces with a high fric-
tional load, the material was mixed with molybdenum, thus taking advantage of the 
previously described positive frictional properties of this element. In comparison with 
the iron and chromium-molybdenum steel mixtures, this mixture contained a higher 
amount of molybdenum. About 25 wt.-% of the mixture were comprised by the 
NiCrBSi-alloy, and the rest was molybdenum. The fraction of the powder mixture was 
90+45 μm. SEM Micrographs of the powder are shown in Figure 5-33.

(middle) and NiCrBSi-particle (right) 
As with the other molybdenum-containing coating system, it can be seen that the mo-
lybdenum powder consists of agglomerated and sintered powder particles. The nickel 
alloy is characterised by gas-atomised powder particles. The elemental analysis of 
the nickel alloy detected all specified elements with the exception of boron which 
could not be detected due to its low atomic number. 
The coatings were sprayed in accordance with the factorial plan, wherein the spray 
distance and the current were varied systematically. An overview of the polished mi-
cro-sections of the coatings is shown in Figure 5-34.

and current. 
Similarly to the other investigated compounds, this material was significantly influ-
enced by the current as well. The samples which were sprayed at 270 A current 
showed the highest porosity levels (Table 5-17). Sample 4-07, which was sprayed 
from a high spray distance (55 mm), also showed the highest number of spherical 
particles. The low energy input and the high spray distance resulted in many partially-
melted and resolidified particles.

The correlation between the porosity and the process parameters is analogous to the 
one observed for the FeCr13/Mo coatings (Figure 5-35). Primarily, the formation of 
pores depends on the current. However, all the samples coated from 35 mm spray 
distance exhibit high porosities so that it must be assumed that the pore formation is 
also a function of the spray distance. The structure depth of the individual pores is 
almost linearly dependent on the number, or rather the area size of pores. This is 
similar to the FeCr13/Mo coatings. The micro-sections indicate that a high porosity 

Microstructured thermally sprayed surfaces

often results from the mechanical processing; it is furthermore associated with the 
connecting pores so that the size and depth of the micro-structure is also determined 
by the post-treatment process.

lybdenum and nickel-chromium, but also small fractions of molybdenum oxide (MO2). 
The MoNiCrBSi coatings show a maximum hardness of 327 HV3 and scatter over a

Analogous to the FeCr13/Mo coatings, the hardness of the Mo/NiCrBSi coatings 
correlate with their porosity.

The tribological tests show an improved behaviour of the layers in comparison to an

5.5 Tribological testing of the inner coating of cylinder liners  
The FeCr13/Mo 50/50 material was chosen as a suitable spray material for the coat-
ing of rotationally symmetrical specimens for use in tribological test rigs. Three liner 
geometries with different diameter and coating lengths were used. Figure 5-38 shows 
schematically the internal coating of a liner together with the plasma torch F210. In 
addition, the experimental setup for the fired testing is shown. The testing of the lin-
ers took place at the Institute of Technical Combustion (ITV). 
 
 
 
Figure 5-38:  Schematic internal coating of a liner (left) based on [FLO03], experimental setup for 
coating liners for fire testing (ITV) (middle) and coating process with blow out of overspray parti-
cles (right) 
The liners for the coating were mounted on a rotary plate and rotated at a speed of 
200 rpm. During the coating the liner was cooled with dried air by two cooling noz-
zles. It was particularly important to cool the lower part of the liner, because the heat 
dissipation downwards is minimal. Furthermore, it was necessary to cool the insides 
of the liner, i.e., the applied coating, as well. Additionally, the powder particles which 
have not been incorporated into the layer, i.e., the so-called overspray, also had to 
be removed. In Figure 5- 38 (right), the blow out of over-spray particles can be seen. 
The incorporation of the overspray in the coating may lead to the failure of the coat-
ing during the mechanical processing or to the formation of pore nests. 
The liners for the RRV- (rotational friction measurement test rig) and shaker-testing 
were sprayed in accordance with the full factorial plan. The test specimens for the 
RRV-tests had a small inner diameter of 83 mm. Two of the liners could not withstand 
the honing process and were excluded from the test series. The coatings of liners 05 
and 09 for the shaker-testing were also destroyed during the honing process. No 
connection with the coating properties is was obvious. When coating the liners for the 
fired testing, spray parameter variations 01 - 03 were omitted. Since these liners had 

90 
Microstructured thermally sprayed surfaces 
a diameter of 130 mm and a length of 253 mm, honing their thermally sprayed coat-
ings was expected to be a major challenge; thus, some liners were chosen in ad-
vance as a backup for the specimens that would most probably be destroyed during 
the honing process. 
The results from the flat samples showed that surface parameters, such as porosity 
and structural depth, but also characteristics, such as the hardness of coating mate-
rials, could be influenced by a specific variation of the spraying parameters. This 
study indicated that the layers depend primarily on the current used and less on the 
spray distance. The microstructure, the cohesion and the indentation hardness are 
largely determined by the variation of the spray parameters. Variables which deter-
mine the layer structure are the heat transfer to the particles and the impact velocity. 
The variation of the current represents the influence of the energy input. High cur-
rents lead to a higher energy input for the spray particles and, thus, determine the 
degree of partial melting and acceleration of the particles. If less energy is applied to 
the spray particles - for example, at low current - the amount of unmelted spherical 
particles increases; accompanied by a low coating cohesion, it results in a high po-
rosity and low hardness. The properties of thermally sprayed coatings are strongly 
dependent on the coating cohesion and adhesion to the substrate. Since the adhe-
sion of the coatings strongly depend on the mechanical interlocking of the particles 
among themselves and with the substrate, unmelted or resolidified particles play an 
important role. An increased number of such particles results in a bad adhesion, so 
that coatings having increasingly occurring round particles exhibit different properties 
than coatings which are mainly composed of splats. The porosity of the thermally 
sprayed coatings was generated near to unmelted or resolidified particles so that it 
could be used as a validation of adhesion. The MoNiCrBSi-01 coating, with its com-
paratively high porosity level (approximately 30%; highest among the investigated 
coatings), is characterised by its disadvantageous frictional behaviour. Nevertheless, 
all investigated molybdenum-containing coatings exhibited better friction behaviour 
than the one of an uncoated substrate. The hardness of the layers depends not only 
on the cohesion but also on the degree of oxidation of the molybdenum particles, as 
molybdenum can form very hard Mo-oxides. In order to ensure that the coatings can 
be machined, e.g., grinded or honed, ductile phases such as steel or nickel-based 
alloys were added, since increasing the amount of ductile phases resulted in lower 
hardness of the coatings. Thus, the FeCr13/Mo coatings have a lower hardness than 
the MoNiCrBSi coatings because their molybdenum content is higher.  
In addition to the good wear and friction performance of the porous thermally sprayed 
coatings, the increased oil retention was another positive effect. For the use in light-
weight engines, they can replace the previously used cast iron liners, thus saving 
weight. Additionally, no significant distortions occur between the aluminium cylinder 
and the coating so that the "blow-by" effect is minimised, and thus, the exhaust emis-
sions are reduced [FLO11].

5.6 Conclusion 
A number of coatings were applied to thermo-mechanically highly stressed surfaces 
by means of atmospheric plasma spraying in order to investigate the influence of the 
spray parameters on the formation of porosities, which can function as micro-
dimples. 
All materials showed similar tendencies: the lower the heat input, due to low current 
or low hydrogen gas flow, the higher the amount of non-melted and re-solidified parti-
cles, which form the starting point for porosities. Additionally, it was determined that 
an increase of the porosity of the coatings results in an increase of the individual pore 
depth. First, the coatings were prepared with a torch for coatings on outer contours, 
and then analysed and subsequently the information of coating these materials were 
transferred to an internal coating process. The coatings that were made with the 
torch F4 MB for outer contours exhibited a much lower porosity and a higher hard-
ness than the coatings made with a torch for inner coatings. The melting rate of the 
powder particles was reduced by the lower energy input of the torch for internal coat-
ings; thus, the amount of non-melted and re-solidified particles increased. The reduc-
tion of the coating cohesion and related hardness was associated with increased po-
rosity. Due to the suitability of the individual materials for application on thermo-
mechanically highly stressed surfaces, various mixtures containing iron, molyb-
denum, and chromium steel were used as coating materials. It was found that molyb-
denum-containing coatings provide a sufficiently high hardness due to the formation 
of brittle oxide phases. The high melting point of molybdenum also allows for its use 
for applications with high thermal stresses. Mixing ductile phases such as the iron to 
the molybdenum phase allowed for easier machining, e.g., grinding and polishing, of 
the coatings. As a function of the used spray parameters, the chromium phase in the 
steel-containing coatings was characterised by an oxidation level different from those 
of the other coatings. The chromium oxide also lead to an increase in hardness. In 
particular, the coatings which were sprayed with low heat input exhibited a high oxi-
dation level of chromium particles because the particles were not strongly melted and 
accelerated, resulting in the formation of oxide films around the particles during their 
flight phase. The materials which were investigated at first were consequently further 
developed; iron was replaced with chromium steel in the molybdenum mixture. The 
purpose was both to increase the corrosion resistance of the coatings and provide 
the internal coatings with sufficient hardness. The Mo/FeCr13 mixture was investi-
gated with respect to the possible control of the porosity and the pore depth. For this 
material, a full factorial plan with different spray distances and currents was used. It 
was revealed that, depending on the spray parameters, different amount of porosities 
and pore depths were created; thus, for example, the current controls the amount of 
pores. The lower the used current, and therefore the applied energy contribution, the 
higher amount of pores can be observed. A self-fluxing molybdenum/nickel alloy was 
chosen additionally for the inner coating. Similar to the FeCr13/Mo mixture, the duc-
tile nickel phase was added to this material in order to ensure further processing of 
the coating. The nickel alloy also showed good corrosion characteristics and hard ox-

92 
Microstructured thermally sprayed surfaces 
ide phases. This coating system was also studied with regards to the formation of po-
rosity as a function of the spray distance and the current. It was shown that the po-
rosity level depends strongly of the current and is less dependent on the spray dis-
tance. For the tribological experiments with cylinder liners of the other project part-
ners, the FeCr13/Mo mixture was selected due to the good tribological behaviour. 
However, due to the differences in hardness between the molybdenum and steel par-
ticles, special attention should be paid to its post treatments, in this case, the honing 
process.

For the complex task of measuring the insides of a cylinder liner using optical sen-
sors, new methods had to be developed. Since optical sensors for areal measure-
ments, such as white light interferometers and confocal microscopes, require too 
much space and have a limited measuring range, a confocal chromatic white light 
sensor was used. The chromatic sensor is a point sensor that allows for precise posi-
tioning inside of cylinder liners, as only a small part of the apparatus has to be 
brought inside the cylinder while the signal is transported to the controller by optical 
fibre. This sensor was incorporated into a coordinate measuring machine that is able 
to position the sensor inside the cylinder with sub micro meter uncertainty. This 
measurement system was modified further to conduct measurements with different 
surface±to-sensor angles to identify undercuts in micro-dimples, which would in-
crease oil retention in the surface. Structured flat surfaces and small cylinder seg-
ments were measured using a white light interferometer and a confocal laser micro-
scope in order to develop and compare data processing and measurement tech-
niques.  
For the characterisation of the structured surfaces, new parameters as well as meth-
ods for calculating these parameters automatically from the measured data had to be 
developed. Moreover, algorithms for the subtraction of the form of the cylinder and

the waviness that take the micro-dimples into account had to be formulated. The re-
search into the exact form of the micro-dimples necessitated the development of a 
new stitching technique so that high resolution data of the single dimples could be 
acquired. Watershed- and threshold-based methods were used for the automatic 
identification of microstructures. For the identification of undercuts, methods of data 
fusion and image processing were implemented, among them morphological 3D thin-
ning. 
6.2 Measurement techniques 
White light interferometer 
A white light interferometer (see Figure 6-2) was used for preliminary measurements 
of flat test surfaces as well as cylindrical test segments for the development of data 
processing techniques. As in a Michelson interferometer, the light emitted by the 
source is split into two separate beams. One is directed at the surface of the test sub-
ject while the other is led along a reference path at the end of which both beams are 
superimposed. If the optical path difference between the two is below the coherence 
length, both beams can interfere with one another, and the signal changes in accord 
with the z-position of the microscope. The signal is recorded by a CCD-chip at the 
end of the optical path. The microscope steps along the z-direction, and a stack of 
intensity values is recorded for each pixel of the field of view. By evaluation of the im-
age stack, the height corresponding to each pixel can be identified and an areal 
height measurement is achieved.

Chromatic sensor 
In a chromatic sensor, dispersion is used to identify the distance between the sensor 
and the sample. The light originating from the sensor is reflected by the surface of the 
sample and guided back to the controller by an optical fiber, where a pinhole is used 
for evaluation. In order to acquire the height information, a spectrometer in the con-
troller measures the central wavelength of the reflected intensity, which varies ac-
cording to the sensor to surface distance due to the chromatic objective lens (see 
Figure 6-3). The controller of the chromatic sensor is operated by a PC-workstation 
via EIA-232 port, formerly known as RS-232. The height data is measured as a 15-
bit-integer number that is scaled by the maximum range of the sensor, which is 429 
μm resulting in a vertical resolution of 13 nm.  
The chromatic sensor was integrated into a multisensor-coordinate-measuring ma-
chine, the MarVision OMS 553 HA (Figure 6-3) by Mahr Multi-sensor GmbH. This 
machine is equipped with four separate axes, three translational and one rotational 
axis. The translational axes move the sensor head, whereas the rotational axis ro-
tates the sample. The translational axes are equipped with glass scales which allow 
for a position certainty of up to 0.1 μm with a translational uncertainty of 0.5 + L / 900 
μm for a translation of length L. 
 
Figure 6-3: Coordinate measuring machine Mahr OMS 553 with chromatic sensor 
Communication with the machine is achieved via the Ethernet protocol mahrtalk to 
acquire information, such as the actual position and target coordinates, directly. An 
aluminium adapter was constructed to integrate the chromatic sensor RB-400.2 by 
Digital Surf into the vertical axis of the coordinate-measuring machine. The chromatic 
sensor is connected to the white light source of the Nobis XT controller by means of 
an optical fiber.  
Software was developed using MATLAB and Python to synchronise and save the 
measured sensor data with the positioning data of the coordinate-measuring ma-
chine. Before the beginning of the measurement, the initial coordinates of the axis 
are calibrated by a homing run; following, the sensor is moved to the actual measur-
ing coordinates. Having reached the measuring coordinates, the sensor is moved, 
with a constant speed, along the x-axis; alternatively, the sample is rotated with a 
constant angular velocity around the y-axis by the rotational axis. When a line meas-

96 
Surface characterisation based on optical metrology 
urement is complete, the sensor moves along the y-axis to the next line. As the sen-
sor moves over the sample, a three dimensional image of the sample surface is rec-
orded. In order not to overload the program memory and therefore the measurement 
process, the measurement data are saved in temporary files to be processed later. 
After completing the measurement, the temporary data recording of the surface to 
sensor height information and the position of the cylinder liner are saved based on 
their timestamps. The lateral resolution of the measurement is equivalent to the step 
width along each scanning axis, which in turn is based on the translation between 
profiles and angular or regular velocity and measurement frequency of the sensor.  
 
Figure 6-4: Physical principle of a chromatic sensor 
To allow for a measurement from multiple angles while still maintaining the ability to 
measure the insides of cylinder liners, a modification of the chromatic sensor head 
was devised. A linear axis was used in conjunction with a hinge joint to change the 
angle between the work piece and the sensor along one axis as seen in Figure 6-5.

6.3 Measurement of machined micro-dimples 
Data preprocessing - stitching 
The form evaluation of the micro-dimples necessitated measurements with a high 
resolution; however, such measurements could not be obtained in a single meas-
urement due to restrictions of the field of view of the white light interferometer. To ad-
dress this problem, multiple overlapping measurements were performed and fused, 
to form a larger field of view. In stitching, measurements or images of scenes related 
to one another by translational transformation are spatially aligned and the data of 
these images is combined into a larger array of height or intensity values.  
Because usual registration techniques like cross correlation for the spatial alignment 
of the measurements are computationally expensive and are not robust against 
translationally invariant image features ([Sze06]), a new method relying on the geo-
metrical information of the dimple was devised. An example of the overlapping high 
resolution measurements can be seen in Figure 6-6.  
 
Figure 6-6: High resolution images of a micro dimple by white light interferometry 
The dimple feature used for alignment of the measurements is the cross-sectional 
area (see page 105) which is a function of the position on the cross section line of the 
dimple representing the area below the reference surface height. The cross-sectional 
area functions of the measurements of Figure 6-6 can be seen in Figure 6-7.

Figure 6-7: Characteristic cross-section area of Figure 6-6 
When comparing the cross-section areas of two adjacent measurements, the shift 
between them is identified by means of an optimisation of a least squares algorithm. 
The relative coordinates of the measurements are then used to align the measure-
ments as seen in Figure 6-8.

Data preprocessing - form and waviness 
In subproject 2, the insides of cylinder liners were structured using fly-cutting pro-
cess, thermal plasma spraying, and honing. To investigate the resulting structures, 
the cylindrical form due to areal measurement using the white light interferometer had 
to be removed for a robust characterisation of the micro-dimples, which does occur 
due to the simultaneous measurement of a high number of surface points, as op-

posed to the point measurements using the chromatic sensor which remove the cyl-
inder form via the measurement principle.  
The cylindrical shape of the measured surface causes height differences in the 
measurements of up to 20 μm, depending on the cylinder radius. An example of an 
unprocessed measurement and a height profile undisturbed by the dimple can be 
seen in Figure 6-9. 
 
Figure 6-9: Unprocessed measurement with form 
Use of a polynomial surface fit of the 4th order ()EDVLF) removes the cylindrical form; 
however, the surface fit overcompensates due to the influence of the dimple. This re-
sults in a data processing artifact in the measurement data 0.

The resulting height data bends downwards at the edges of the field of view as seen 
in Figure 6-10. The differences in height introduced by the basic fit have a typical 
amplitude of a few micrometers.

Segmentation methods for the identification of micro-dimples 
Using segmentation algorithms, such as watershed and threshold methods, allows to 
identify the area of the cavities as well as to consequently remove it from the meas-
urement data by replacing the cavities with NaN-values. These are either replaced by 
the mean height value of the plane of reference or interpolated to form the basis for a 
more accurate fit. The new measurement data sets 0]HUR and 0LQWHUS are formed as 
follows:

When using a constant replacement, the final surface still retains a slope of ca. 1μm 
amplitude; in contrast, the profile of the surface obtained by interpolation shows no 
geometrical deviation. 
Data processing - region detection 
The measured height-data is saved in a two dimensional matrix (see Figure 6-13). 
The next step is the identification of the structured surface parts in the height-map by 
means of segmentation. 
 
Figure 6-13:  Measurement data of a micro machined surface, measured by a chromatic sensor 
The first segmentation step is executed by means of watershed transformation, i.e., 
by flooding the lowest part of the surface with virtual water. As the level of the water 
rises it meets the basin boundaries. The watershed regions are the boundaries of the 
water basin at the time of overspill. This way, the data is successively segmented by 
height. Since the structures have height values below the plane of reference, these 
are segmented first. The material heaped around the structures (ridges), by the cut-
ting process, (Figure 6-14) is segmented as a region which lies between the struc-
tures. These regions belong to the surface and are therefore falsely segmented as a 
structure. 
In the lower part of Figure 6-15, a more successful method for structure identification 
is presented. This method works by defining a threshold on the surface at tstructure= 
0,2 μm. This is an empirically measured value that gave the best results for segmen-
tation of micro-dimples and ridges. So the structure mask Rstructures is given by:

Figure 6-14: Watershed transformation, false structure detection 
Figure 6-15 presents the structure mask identified by the threshold process. Since, in 
general, a number of structures can be found in a single structure mask Rstructures, 
these have to be registered as separate regions.  To this end, the structure mask is 
divided by assigning each true pixel a regional index based on its neighbourhood 
[VIN91]. After the regional assignment, regions that have fewer pixels than the 
threshold vale are discarded, as these are either false regions or micro-dimples that 
were incompletely measured. As a result, only completely measured micro-dimples 
remain for evaluation (Figure 6-15). By only accessing height information pstructure(x,y) 
of one of the identified regions via a specific region mask, the measured structures 
are separated from the rest of the measured data. 
 
Figure 6-15:  Structure mask of Figure 6-13 (left), labelled regions (right) 
Next to the microstructures, the cutting process creates hills of surface material that 
are not a part of the structures and have to be described separately. The search for 
these ridges is restricted to an extended bounding box around the primary structure. 
The original bounding box is extended by a factor 1.4.

Data processing ± micro-dimple characteristics 
In cooperation with subproject 2 new descriptive parameters were developed to 
characterise the micro-dimples. The parameters and their calculation will be ex-
plained in the following chapter. Using common fabrication parameters, the micro-
dimples have two axes of symmetry: the longitudinal section VሬറL and the cross section 
VሬറF. These are vectors in the measuring plane (see Figure 6-17). They can be ob-
tained by fitting two lines to the height data of each structure whereby the first one 
gives the longitudinal section, and the second is fitted perpendicular to the first one 
and gives the cross section.  
 
 
Figure 6-17:  Longitudinal and cross section of micro-dimples (left), scale along alternate axes 
(right) 
The measured height data is formatted as a two dimensional array that represents an 
equidistant grid. By identifying the angle between the x-axis and the axis of the longi-
tudinal section the orientation angle of the structure can be found and the measure-
ment data rotated.   
The resolution along the x-axis is given by xscale = d (xn,xn+1), where d(a,b) is the Eu-
clidean distance measure for the points a and b and is a parameter that describes 

104

the measurement. The resolution along the y axis is defined in a similar way. After 
rotating the measurement data to correct the orientation of the dimples the mean 
resolution along an axis with an angle of ݊ to the x axis in the image plane (Figure 
6-17), is given by:

the length of the cross section.

Figure 6-18:  Dimple length and dimple width 
Maximum dimple depth ap,max and histogram based threshold dimple depth ap,hist 
The maximum dimple depth ap is the depth of the deepest point in the dimple, and 
the minimum value of the height map in the structure region is used for this parame-
ter. 
ap,max = min (pstructure(x,y)) 
As this parameter is only based on a single pixel value, it is extremely susceptible to 
noise and measurement artefacts.  
A more robust parameter can be calculated by plotting a histogram of the height val-
ues of the structure region. Figure 6-19 shows that the pixel numbers decrease rapid-
ly for high depth values, but this descent still takes place over a few micrometers. A 
threshold which ignores the 4 deepest percent of the height values is used. Experi-
ments have confirmed this to be a robust threshold value. In the following, only the 
histogram-based dimple depths are used, and therefore, simply called dimple depth.

The ridges originating from the cutting process need to be analysed separately, as 
the orientation of the blade affects their form. Similar to the parameters for dimple 
depths, parameters based on single values and histogram-based parameters were 
defined. The calculation of these parameters follows the same steps as those de-
scribed for the dimple depths (above).

Tool radius rWZ, dimple depth by circular fit ap,fit 
In the cutting process, the blade moves along a circular path. By fitting a circle to the 
height data along the longitudinal section, the radius of this path can be estimated. 
This radius is called tool radius. By applying the same method, the dimple depth can 
be calculated as well. By using the centre of the fitted circle as a reference point, the 
dimple depth can be calculated as followsǣap,fit = rWZ ± zcircle

Relative dimple volume fab 
The relative dimple volume is a measure that sets the volume of the ridges and the 
volume of the dimples in relation [GAH81]. Only the areas, and not the volumes, are 
used for calculation in the cross section:

Thus, for small ridges IDE§, while for more pronounced hills fab is small. A case of 
ideal micro cutting would be fab = 1, whereas fab=0 would be an example of ideal mi-
cro ploughing (see subproject 2). A more in depth description of the ridge / dimple 
volumes is achieved by evaluating fab not only at the point ap,hist but also across the 
length of the dimple at different cross sections. This way, a parameter vector IറDEcan 
be formed from the fab. For a more robust calculation, the mean over all of these 
cross sections is used.

The longitudinal roughness Ra,l is a measure for the areal dimple quality, and the

Edge angle İand Edge radius rİ 
The blade used in the cutting process is the negative of the dimple (see Figure 6-24). 
The tip of the blade can be described by a circle with radius rİ up to a certain height. 
If the blade cuts in deeper than the tip radius rİ the upper, triangular form of the blade 
is also found in the resulting dimple and can be identified via the angle İ (see Figure 
6-23).

Surface characterisation based on optical metrology 
These parameters are obtained by fitting a circle to the height data of the cross sec-
tion and lines to the outlying regions using a least-square-procedure (see Figure 
6-24). 
 
Figure 6-24:  Circular fit to micro-dimple, surface ifw0030 
A geometric difference analysis between the blade and the resulting dimples was 
conducted on blades used in the cutting process. The blades and dimples were 
measured using a white light interferometer to compare the cross sections of blade 
and dimple. The measurement data of the blade was used to create a binary image 
of the blade profile in which artifacts were repaired by the morphological operation of 
dilation followed by erosion. Using a gradient algorithm, the contour of the blade was 
determined (see Figure 6-25). The cross sections of blade VሬറWRRO[ and dimple VሬറT were 
fitted together by a least square algorithm.  
A starting position for the fitting algorithm is found by searching for the global minima 
of both functions and removing the offset:

Data processing ± micro pore characteristics 
The stochastic structures created by thermal plasma spraying were characterised by 
statistical evaluation of a number of surface images. This option was chosen over the 
stitching of multiple images because the errors introduced by the stitching exceeded 

110

the information gained and because the pore structures have small dimensions com-
pared to the area of the measurement. 
 
Figure 6-27: Measurement of stochastic structures, surface CA2 
Defects that appear at the edges of the structures were interpolated. The surfaces 
were aligned by a planar fit to the height data, and the plane of reference was deter-
mined by a histogram based analysis. Figure 6-28 shows the histograms of two 
height maps of the test subject CA2. The reference plane was determined by the 
maximum value of the histogram, and the new height map was calculated by p(x,y) - 
hmax,hist.

The stochastic structures caused by thermal plasma spraying had no symmetry but 
had a statistical height and width distribution; therefore, a more general approach 
was used to accurately describe their properties. The area of all pores was divided by 
the area of measurement to form the quotient AV.

6.5 Multi-measurement methods 
Undercut detection  
Simulations were used to check whether the data fusion algorithms can fuse the dif-
ferent data to a 3D dataset of the surface. While varying the angle between the sur-
face and the sensor, a virtual undercut normal was created, and a simulated meas-
urement was conducted. Afterwards, the resulting individual measurements were 
fused based on the positioning data. Consequently, the surface of the material was 
reconstructed from the data. The measurement process can be seen in Figure 6-30 
a) to c) with the result in Figure 6-30 d). The reconstruction of the surface (grey line in 
Figure 6-30 d) from the different fused height data was achieved stepwise while tak-
ing the measurement direction into consideration. 
Data processing ± undercut detection  
Areal microscopic- and optical point sensor methods only allow  measurements of 
functions of two lateral coordinates; in case of translations, for each pair of coordi-
nates x and y only one value z(x,y) will be measured. Surfaces including undercuts 
as seen in Figure 6-31 are functions of three coordinates. The measurement data are 
angle dependent projections of the true surface, so measurements under varying sur-

face to sensor angle and data fusion are needed to reconstruct surfaces with under-
cuts.  
 
Figure 6-30:  a)-c) scanning process of a microstructure with undercuts, d) resulting surface esti-
mation 
A method was devised to reconstruct full 3D data of surfaces from multiple meas-
urements with optical surface sensors by varying the measurement angle.  
In the first step, the different measurements were converted from matrices with height 
values to point clouds which were then rotated into equal positions by means of a 
least square optimisation method. The point clouds were constructed from the coor-
dinates and the original indices of each point of measurement in the height matrix. 
This was necessary to obtain connectivity information which was needed in the re-
construction of 3D bulk data.

In the next step, the rotationally aligned point clouds were interpolated into height 
matrices for spatial alignment. The alignment was performed using image registration 
techniques developed at our institute. The alignment coordinates were then used to 
transform the point clouds into the same coordinate system. Consequently, the 
aligned data was used to construct 3D bulk data for each measurement by linear in-
terpolation and morphological filling. The bulk data consisted of binary 3D matrixes 
whereby 0 represented the workpiece material and 1 - the outside of the workpiece 
(Figure 6-32).The fusion necessary for the reconstruction of the 3D object was per-

Figure 6-33 indicates the presence of undercuts in the micro-dimples, which widen 
roughly below the surface by 0.3 μm with cavity openings of a few micrometers and 
depths of 2 to 3 μm. As the spot size of the chromatic sensor is about 1 μm, such 
cavities could only be represented by a very small number of pixels which, in combi-
nation with the difficulties of image registration and rotational correction, complicated 
the actual reconstruction of these microstructures by chromatic measurements.  
Even the higher resolution of the white light interferometer was insufficient to suc-
cessfully reconstruct undercut cavities. Future work should focus on improving the 
rotational correction and image registration so that smaller structures can be recon-
structed better.

3D morphological-thinning 
A new approach for the characterisation of surfaces by morphological thinning was 
investigated. To successfully identify structures, a method for the detection of hills 
and valleys was developed using morphological 3D thinning. Thinning is a method 
that extracts the topology of binary data. In 2D, topologic features consist of connect-
ed areas, junctions, endpoints and holes (Figure 6-34). In 3D, additional features like 
through holes that connect two not-set areas can also be taken into consideration.

6.6 Conclusion 
Optical measurement techniques allow for a fast and non-destructive evaluation of 
surface roughness. To adapt optical sensors to the challenge of surface characterisa-
tion of microstructured cylinder liners, new measurement and data processing meth-
ods were developed and implemented. The complex geometry of the microstructures 
to be characterised necessitated new approaches for structure identification and form 
removal.  
The optical sensors used for measurement of the microstructured surfaces were a 
confocal chromatic sensor, a point sensor using chromatic aberration for distance 
measurement, and a white light interferometer, which uses incoherent light and im-
age stacks for areal height measurements. 
Optical measurements inside of intact cylinder liners were complicated due to the 
small size of the cylinder opening compared to the size of the sensor. To overcome 
this problem, a sensor setup was constructed using a coordinate measuring machine 
(CMM) as well as a specially tailored sensor head with a chromatic point sensor and 
an optical fiber. The CMM was used to position the sensor head inside the cylinder 
liner at close to ideal measuring distance and orientation. The point sensor measured 
the distance between the sensor and the object while the CMM rotated the cylinder 
liner. The synchronous positioning information provided by the CMM and by the 
chromatic sensor were fused to obtain 3D coordinates of the cylinder liner surface.  
The main merit of this technique was that the cylinder form was removed by the 
measurement setup. 
To analyse the form of micro-dimples, high resolution measurements using a white 
light interferometer were made. Due to a small field of view with respect to the dim-
ples, these measurements had to be aligned among each other to form a larger 

Surface characterisation based on optical metrology

measurement data set. The proper alignment was achieved by identifying the relative 
shift between two images when evaluating the area cross-section with respect to the 
lateral position. Using a least square fit, the area cross-sections of each single meas-
urements data sets were aligned with their respective neighbours. Based on this, the 
single measurement data sets were fused to form a large scale, high resolution im-
age of the micro-dimples. These measurements allowed for an analysis of smaller 
features of the dimples than the measurements using the chromatic sensor. 
The measurements using a white light interferometer were carried out on samples 
with underlying cylinder form, which had to be removed for proper evaluation of the 
dimples. Simple form removal by polynomial fit to the surface results in flawed find-
ings due to the influences of the microstructures. Thus, a new method which removes 
the form regardless of the structured surface parts had to be designed. In a first step, 
the form was removed by a polynomial fit; consequently, the structures were seg-
mented and replaced with other height values which fit the plane of reference better. 
Following, a second polynomial fit was used on the remaining data. Both surface fits 
were then removed from the original measurement, and the relevant surface micro-
structure was evaluated.   
Investigation of a large number of structured surface samples necessitated automat-
ed segmentation algorithms. Microstructures in the measurement data were identified 
by segmentation using watershed and threshold methods. The bounding box sur-
rounding the structures was extended and used to search for ridges at the edges of 
the structures by means of threshold methods.  
To find correlations between the form of the microstructures on the surface samples 
and their respective tribological behaviour, the identified structures were character-
ised by parameters describing their individual form as well as more statistical param-
eters such as areal and volumetric ones. Micro-dimples were also compared to the 
blade used in the cutting process by fitting an idealised blade to the structure or to 
the actual measurement data of the used blades. 
To analyse microstructures for possible undercuts, which would increase the value of 
a number of areal and volumetric parameters used for surface evaluation, methods 
that allow for undercut detection were developed. The sensor head of a chromatic 
sensor was modified to allow for an adaptation of the surface to sensor angle, which 
allows for the measurement of undercuts. The undercuts could then be identified by 
evaluation of large measurement data sets obtained by 3D data fusion of several 
smaller data sets. Another method was developed for the recognition of undercuts 
using a white light interferometer; this method involved the automatic measurement 
of overlapping high resolution fields of view and merging them to form a larger field of 
view. The process was repeated for different surface to sensor angles; the resulting 
measurements were then aligned and transformed into 3D binary data and merged. 
With the aim of identifying undercuts automatically, a new method was developed to 
skeletonise 3D binary data. This method is based on the thinning of 2D binary data, 

118 
Surface characterisation based on optical metrology 
which removes morphologically irrelevant pixels. This was generalised to a 3D binary 
voxel space. This algorithm showed great potential for the analysis of 3D surface da-
ta for hills and valleys as well as undercuts, which can be identified by the endpoints 
of the 3D surface skeleton.

In order to verify the friction-minimising potential of machined micro-dimples, they 
were cut into thrust bearing rings; consequently, their functional properties were de-
termined on a ring-on-disc tribometer setup for planar contact with large surface cov-
erage. Furthermore the tribology results of the machined micro-dimples were conse-
quently compared with experimental testing results of micro-dimples that were fabri-
cated with other manufacturing methods. This was done, in order to emphasize the 
potential of the new innovative micro structuring method by means of cutting, which 
was developed within this research (see chapter 4). 
Ring-on-disc tribometer tests 
The tribological performance of the micro-dimples was characterised by means of a 
ring-on-disc setup on a Wazau TRM 5000 tribometer. Lapped (Ra = 0.05 μm 
to 0.1 μm) starting discs structured by machining and made of aluminium bronze Cu-
Si10Ni5Fe4 alloy were combined with a rotating axial cylinder roller bearing disc 
(steel, tempered and lapped) (Figure 7-1).

rotation - floats on a ball. The fully-lubricated tests are carried out using an entirely

the flow of force below the fixed disc, measures the normal force Fn and the friction 
torque MFr with a measuring frequency of 100 Hz. Taking the mean ring diameter into 
consideration, the friction coefficient is calculated based on the variables listed 
above. In order to detect speed-dependent effects, the disc is accelerated up to a 
relative speed of 9 m/s. From this point on, a linear deceleration of the speed until 
standstill takes place within a preset time interval of 3 min; as a result, the entire 
Stribeck curve can be continuously depicted for this range.  
For these ring-on-disc tribometer tests, micro-dimples were cut in a radial arrange-
ment into the bronze rings via an orthogonal turn-milling kinematics (Figure 7-2, left). 
In Figure 7-2, right, the parameters relevant for the surface characterisation in this 
chapter are outlined.  
   
Figure 7-2: Machining strategy for the axial bearing rings and surface parameters relevant for the 
ring-on-disc tribometer tests 
In the context of these tribometer tests, only micro-dimples with a U-shaped cross-
section profile were considered. First, only the micro-dimple ratio was varied 
(SMT = 11 % to 45 %), depending on the tangential micro-dimple distance (stan = 
0.25 mm to 1 mm). The micro-dimple ratio SMT was defined as the percentage ratio of 
the projected micro-dimple area AMT to the total surface area Atot. as follows:

Furthermore, the arrangement of the micro-dimples (no offset and 50% offset) as well 
as the micro-dimple dimension were varied via the maximum depth of cut 
(ap,max = 10 μm to 50 μm). For V-shaped cross section profiles, the geometry of the 
cross sections of the individual micro-dimples was also varied via the tool cutting

edge angle (N= 15° to 55°)In all test series, the radial micro-dimple distance re-
mained constant at srad = 1.5 mm.  
Only those Stribeck curves where the surfaces of the employed rings and discs 
showed even contact patterns after the test runs were used in the evaluation. This 
was necessary in order to identify the influence of the individual present surface pa-
rameters in a reproducible way. During the test series, the oil temperature was moni-
tored and kept constant at 60° C by means of a continuous readjustment. This was 
necessitated by the previously identified dependence of the friction coefficient on the 
oil temperature and, thus, on the oil viscosity. 
Functioning of machined micro-dimples 
Prior to focusing on the individual influence of the varied surface parameters, it had to 
be clarified if, to what extent, and in which speed range the machined micro-dimples 
have a friction-minimising effect for the ring-disc-contact investigated in this research. 
Figure 7-3 illustrates the functioning of micro-dimples. The Stribeck curves of a slide 
ring with micro-dimples (ap,max = 20 μm, stan = 0.5 mm, SMT = 15 %, 50% offset) as 
well as of a slide ring without micro-dimples are compared, each for the two test 
loads 325 N and 650 N. Both slide rings have a comparable fundamental roughness. 
Both Stribeck curves show the mean values of three test runs. 
 
Figure 7-3: Functioning of micro-dimples at different test loads and speeds 
Regardless of whether micro-dimples were created on the rings or not, the Stribeck 
curves first showed load-specific differences in their levels. In the hydrodynamic 
range, in particular, the level of the Stribeck curve rises when the test load decreas-

122 
Tribological mechanisms of microstructures 
es. Etsion et al., who investigated structured and non-structured rings in the ring-on-
disc contact, explains this load-dependent tendency with the lubrication gap height 
[ETS04]. With decreasing load, the height of the lubrication gap increases, leading to 
energetically unfavourable turbulences and shear effects becoming predominant in 
the gap itself. In the hydrodynamic range, a similar effect is based on the increase of 
the friction coefficient. The lubrication gap height increases as well due to the in-
creasing of the relative speed between the friction partners. The shearing losses in 
the lubricant also increase as a function of the relative speed.  
At low relative speeds, the friction-minimising potential of machined micro-dimples is 
independent of test load and relative speed in the range of limited and mixed friction 
of the Stribeck curve. Micro-dimples can reduce the respective minimum friction coef-
ficient of the Stribeck curves by 24% to 36%, depending on the respective test load. 
Another tribological effect of micro-dimples is a considerable shifting of the minimum 
friction coefficient towards lower relative speeds. While the minimum friction coeffi-
cients without micro-dimples are in a speed range of v = 1.36 m/s to 2.04 m/s, the 
minimum friction coefficients with micro-dimples are in a speed range of v = 0.38 m/s 
to 0.46 m/s. When using micro-dimples, the minimum friction coefficients can thus be 
shifted between 72% and 77% towards lower relative speeds. This shifting can also 
be seen from the steeper decline of the Stribeck curves. When using micro-dimples, 
the tribological system changes much faster from the mixed friction range to the hy-
drodynamic range; this is especially profitable in the case of starting or oscillating 
tribological systems. The shifting of the minimum friction coefficients towards lower 
values and speeds corresponds to the results of [ETS99a, ETS99b, ETS09, WAN04].  
In the hydrodynamic range, some test series show higher friction coefficient levels 
when micro-dimples are cut into the surface. This is explained by the fact that micro-
dimples represent an additional surface roughness which can lead to additional en-
ergetically unfavourable turbulence in the lubricant film, particularly in case of high 
relative speeds between the friction partners. 
Influence of micro-dimple ratio on friction coefficient and minimum friction co-
efficient 
In the following, the tangential micro-dimple distance was varied between 
stan = 0.25 mm and 1 mm by means of the speed ratio during the turn-milling process. 
The variation of this surface parameter was combined with a variation of the micro-
dimple ratio in a range of SMT = 11% and 45%. In Figure 7-4, top, the Stribeck curves 
for the different micro-dimple ratios are shown, and the corresponding minimum fric-
tion coefficients are explicitly given. The results show that the friction coefficient de-
creases with an increasing micro-dimple ratio. At the same time, the minimum friction 
coefficient declines continuously. Compared with a non-structured surface, the mini-
mum friction coefficient can be reduced up to 50% by means of a micro-dimple ratio 
of 45%. A clear tendency whether the minimum friction coefficient is shifting with the 
micro-dimple ratio towards lower speeds cannot be observed.  

Tribological mechanisms of microstructures 
123 
 
Figure 7-4: Influence of the micro-dimple ratio on the characteristic of the friction coefficient and 
the minimum friction coefficient 
Reducing the friction coefficient in dependence on the micro-dimple ratio corresponds 
to the work of [LAG00, SCH05, WOE06]. The reduction is explained by the fact that 
the number of micro pressure peaks in the contact area increases simultaneously 
with the number of micro-dimples and, thus, with the total contact pressure. Uehara 
and Wakuda also found out that the friction coefficient increases again when micro-
dimple ratios rise extremely [UEH03, WAK03]. In their opinion, this tendency can be 
explained by the fact that the decrease of the micro-dimple ratio leads to a decrease 
of the contact ratio of the examined surface. This decreasing contact ratio leads to a 
higher surface pressure which results in reduced lubrication gap heights and, conse-
quently, in increased mixed friction ratios. However, the tendency of the friction coef-

124 
Tribological mechanisms of microstructures 
ficient to rise again with the micro-dimple ratio could not be verified for the variation 
range of this research work.  
Influence of micro-dimple arrangement on friction coefficient and minimum 
friction coefficient 
The tribological examinations also focused on the arrangement of micro-dimples, dis-
tinguishing between no offset and 50% offset (Figure 7-5, right). Both types of struc-
tures had identical tangential and radial micro-dimple distances and dimensions and, 
as a result, the same micro-dimple ratios.  
The tribological differences between these two structure variations are shown in Fig-
ure 7-5. Despite identical micro-dimple densities and dimensions, structures without 
offset show a continuously lower friction coefficient level throughout the complete 
speed range when compared to those with 50% offset,. The Stribeck curve is shifted 
DOPRVWLQSDUDOOHOE\DQDYHUDJHRIǻ = 0.006 towards the lower friction coefficients. 
Considering the minimum friction coefficient, micro-dimples arranged with no offset 
lead to reduced friction coefficients of 63%, whereas the 50% offset structure shows 
a reduced friction coefficient of 20%. Both structure variations exhibit a comparable 
shifting of the minimum friction coefficient towards lower speeds. 
 
Figure 7-5: Influence of the micro-dimple arrangement (no offset/50% offset) on the characteristic 
of the friction coefficient) 
The different levels of the Stribeck curves for the two structure variations are due to 
the radial coverage of successive micro-dimples. If there is no offset, an exact radial 
coverage of successive micro-dimples arranged with a tangential distance of stan is 

Tribological mechanisms of microstructures 
125 
reached. In case of 50% offset, successive micro-dimples are radially offset by half of 
the radial distance, in the present case by 0.75 mm, so that an exact coverage can 
only be reached with the next but one micro-dimple. Thus, compared to the struc-
tures without offset, the distance between two micro-dimples is doubled. In the range 
of the minimum friction coefficient, in particular, a similar tribological effect seems to 
exist when using a structure without offset. This effect was observed when increasing 
the micro-dimple density. It can be concluded that both the number of micro-dimples 
on a surface element and their arrangement on the element affect the pressure build-
up and the resulting friction properties.  
Influence of micro-dimple dimensions on friction coefficient and minimum fric-
tion coefficient  
Prior to the experimental phase of this project, it was deliberated that apart from the 
number and the arrangement of micro-dimples, their dimensions would influence the 
friction properties as well. Thus, the micro-dimple dimensions were varied by means 
of the maximum depth of cut ap,max. Figure 7-6 compares the Stribeck curves for U-
profile geometries with maximum micro-dimple depths between ap,max = 10 μm 
and 50 μm. Moreover, in Figure 7-6, middle, the minimum friction coefficients as well 
as the micro-dimple volumes are plotted depending on the micro-dimple depth. 
Depending on the micro-dimple dimensions, the friction coefficient level decreases 
over the complete speed range almost in parallel to the reduced micro-dimple dimen-
sions. Compared to a non-structured surface, the lowest micro-dimple depth of 
ap,max = 10 μm allows a reduced minimum friction coefficient of 85%. Furthermore, 
the minimum friction coefficient shifts with decreasing micro-dimple dimensions to-
wards lower relative speeds. In Figure 7-6, the minimum friction coefficients as well 
as the corresponding micro-dimple volumes are plotted depending on the micro-
dimple depth. It can be seen that both variables follow a similar exponential growth, 
indicating that differing minimum friction coefficients are primarily caused by the vol-
ume of the micro-dimples. 
In the hydrodynamic range, micro-dimple dimensions show an influence on the fric-
tion coefficient level. On average, this level decreases with smaller micro-dimple di-
mensions. This tendency can be explained by the fact that due to their smaller di-
mensions (depth, area, volume) as well as their smaller effective tool cutting edge 
angle, smaller micro-dimples produce less turbulence in the lubrication gap. Howev-
er, there are also limits in dependence on the micro-dimple dimensions. If the micro-
dimples are too large, as is the case with a maximum micro-dimple depth of 
ap,max = 50, the friction coefficient level clearly exceeds the one of a non-structured 
surface (in this case by 66%). At this point, micro-dimples cause an increase in fric-
tion. The reason for such an increase in the minimum friction coefficient towards 
larger micro-dimple dimensions can be seen in the reduced pressure build-up. 
[UEH04] proved as well that increased micro-dimple dimensions lead to a decrease 
in their friction-minimising potential. In his opinion, this is because larger micro-dimple 
dimensions allow an easier oil transport from the dimples to the lubrication gap, coun-

126 
Tribological mechanisms of microstructures 
teracting the pressure build-up in the micro-dimple. [GAH09] postulates that exces-
sively deep surface structures can even lead to a collapse of the lubricant film; he 
identifies this as the reason for the noticeably high friction coefficient level at a micro-
dimple depth of ap,max= 50 μm. 
 
Figure 7-6: Influence of the micro-dimple depth on the characteristic of the friction coefficient and 
the minimum friction coefficient 

Tribological mechanisms of microstructures

The described effect of depth could be observed for all examined micro-dimple cross 
section geometries. In Figure 7-6, bottom, the minimum friction coefficients are plot-
ted depending on the micro-dimple depth for U profiles, rectangular profiles, sym-
metrical and asymmetrical V profiles. It can be seen that, on average, the minimum 
friction coefficients rise almost linearly, depending on the micro-dimple depth. The 
values measured for the different micro-dimple cross section geometries are overlap-
ping; thus, at this point, no general statement can be made concerning the geometry 
flow. However, the used V-profile geometries clearly show level differences, which 
are examined in the following parts of this paper.  
Influence of micro-dimple geometry on friction coefficient and minimum fric-
tion coefficient  
The systematic variation of the micro-dimple cross section geometry was carried out 
by means of the flank angle between N = 15 ° and 55 ° (Figure 7-7).  
 
Figure 7-7: Influence of the flank angle on the characteristic of the friction coefficient and the min-
imum friction coefficient 

128 
Tribological mechanisms of microstructures 
All other geometry parameters, including the opposite tool cutting edge angle, were 
kept at a constant level. When creating micro-dimples, the flank angle was set by 
means of the angle N. 
The friction coefficient level decreases towards smaller flank angles over the com-
plete speed range. At a flank angle of N = 15 °, the friction coefficient level of the non-
structured disc is slightly lower compared to the microstructured disc for the hydrody-
namic range. This is due to the fact that micro-dimples with smaller flank angles pro-
duce less turbulence in the lubricant. 
In the range of limited and mixed friction, a clear tendency can be observed as well. 
In Figure 7-7, bottom, the minimum friction coefficient is plotted depending on the 
flank angle declines continuously towards smaller flank angles. At a flank angle of 
N = 15 °, the minimum friction coefficient can be reduced by up to 79% compared to 
the non-structured surface. This tendency is due to the fact that micro-dimples with 
smooth flanks favour pressure build-up since, due to their geometry, they provide a 
tapered lubrication gap. This supports the hydrodynamic contact pressure build-up. 
No clear tendency that the minimum friction coefficient shifts with smaller flank angles 
towards lower relative speeds can be observed. 
Conclusion 
In this chapter, the friction-minimising potential of machined micro-dimples as well as 
the influence of the micro-dimple arrangement, dimension and geometry on friction 
characteristics under planar contact conditions was systematically evaluated. At low 
relative speeds, the friction-minimising potential of machined micro-dimples is inde-
pendent of test load and relative speed in the range of limited and mixed friction of 
the Stribeck curve. Apart from reduced minimum friction coefficients, micro-dimples 
also lead to a significant shift of the coefficient towards lower relative speeds. These 
tendencies are additionally amplified by the high micro-dimple ratio characteristic of 
the no offset arrangement, by small micro-dimple dimensions as well as by a flank 
angle tapered in the speed direction of the sliding partner. During testing, with the 
creation of micro-dimples, the minimum friction coefficient could be reduced by up to 
79% and shifted by 77% towards lower relative speeds. The effects which were iden-
tified indicate that machined micro-dimples support hydrodynamic pressure build-up 
between the friction partners under planar contact conditions, which is in accordance 
with the findings of the contemporary state-of-the-art research. 
The friction-minimising effect of micro-dimples in the range of low sliding speeds can 
be used especially efficiently for starting plain bearing systems. Plain bearings in a 
combustion engine as for example crankshaft, camshaft and big end bearings are po-
tential fields of application for micro-dimples. Since automatic start-stop systems 
have gained popularity, tribological stressed componets in combustion engines pass 
through the mixed friction range much more often than before, thus, offering an 
enormous application potential for friction-minimising microstructures.

7.2 Tribological mechanisms of microstructured thermally sprayed surfaces

Fr.-W. Bach, K. Möhwald, M. Erne, C. Hübsch, H. J. Maier 
The potential friction-reducing properties of thermally sprayed coatings were exam-
ined on a pin-on-disc tribometer. For these experiments, the pins were coated and 
tested against a cast iron and a hardened-steel disc, respectively. The contact is 
comparable with the pairing piston ring/liner surface [LAN87]. 
Pin-on-disc experiments 
The tribological behaviour of various coatings with different porosity was investigated 
by means of a pin-on-disc testing machine on the tribometer TRM 5000 (Wazau 
GmbH, Berlin). The specimens were coated on steel substrates and ground and elec-
trochemically polished for the experiments. The pins were floats on a ball and locked 
to prevent rotation so that a complete surface contact was ensured (Figure 7-8). The 
samples were tested against a counter disc of cast iron (test series Fe/Mo 50-50 and 
FeCr13) or hardened steel (test series FeCr13/Mo 50-50 and Mo/NiCrBSi 75-25) in a 
motor oil bath. 
 
Figure 7-8: Pin-on-disc tribometer setup and boundary conditions of the test 
In contrast to the tribological tests of the machined micro-dimples, the pin-on-disc 
setup was selected for the experiments with the thermal spray coatings. Ring-on-disc 
experiments with the FeCr13/Mo-coatings showed that plane-parallel contact surfac-
es of the specimen could not be easily manufactured: The coating of the rings lead to 
thermally induced distortions and, thus, a uniform surface contact could not be en-
sured. All experiments took place under full lubrication with fully synthetic motor oil 
with a viscosity of 0W30. In the first experiments with the Fe/Mo 50-50 and the 

130 
Tribological mechanisms of microstructures 
FeCr13 coatings, the influence of the normal force and the engine oil temperature 
were investigated. The samples were tested with forces of 100 N, 200 N, 300 N, and 
400 N - which correspond to loading pressures of 1.25 MPa, 2.5 MPa, 3.75 MPa, and 
5 MPa - and with oil at room temperature (RT), 60 °C, 90 ° C, and 120 °C. For the 
studies on the FeCr13/Mo and Mo/NiCrBSi coatings, a force of 300 N and an oil tem-
perature of 60 °C were chosen. A 2-component dynamometer, integrated below the 
fixed disc, was used to measure the normal force FN and the friction torque MFr with a 
measuring frequency of 100 Hz. The friction coefficient was calculated based on 
these variables, considering the mean ring diameter (Figure 7-9).

Figure 7-9: Schematic illustrating the pin-on-disc setup with relevant variables 
For the experiments, various test speeds were chosen to detect speed-dependent 
effects and to determine the behaviour of the coating in the three states of friction 
(contact, mixing, and liquid friction). The counter disc was quickly accelerated to 8 
m/s and 10 m/s, and within 5 min, decelerated to 0 m/s. As a result, a Stribeck curve 
which shows the measured friction coefficient as a function the relative speeds could 
be created. The speed represents the lubricating gap height between the friction 
partners that result from the different speeds, oil viscosity, and pressures [CZI10]. 
The pins were placed into the specially prepared bearing with sample holders for pins 
(see Figure 5-20) for the coating in order to obtain results that are relevant for actual 
applications of internal coatings. For the Fe/Mo 50-50 and FeCr13 coatings, the 
Taguchi L9-plan (see Table 5-3) was used so that for each spray material, nine dif-
ferent coatings were applied. For the FeCr13/Mo 50-50 and Mo/NiCrBSi 75-25 coat-
ings, the full factorial spray plan was used, wherein the spray distance and the cur-
rent rating were varied (see Table 5-13).  
Tribological properties of the Fe/Mo 50-50 coatings 
Overall, the individual Stribeck curves of the Fe/Mo 50-50 coatings lie in a very nar-
row friction-coefficient interval. The following figure shows the Fe/Mo 50-50 - coatings 
at room temperature and a load of 100 N. In the field of hydrodynamic friction, the 
curves are positioned close to each other because in this region, the two sliding part-
ners are separated by a lubricant film.  

Tribological mechanisms of microstructures 
131 
Figure 7-10:  Stribeck curves of the Fe/Mo 50-50 coatings at room temperature and a load of 100 
N. 
As a comparison to the Fe/Mo 50-50 coatings, a steel substrate (X153CrMoV12) was 
tested with the same diameter. At nearly all loads and temperatures, the predominat-
ing effect is that the coatings provide better friction behaviour. In particular, the range 
of mixed friction, which occurs at low speeds, is relevant to the evaluation of wear. An 
early change of mixed friction in the hydrodynamic state of the liquid friction is desir-
able since, in this state, the two friction partners are separated by a sliding lubricating 
gap. This means that the occurring friction as well as the associated wear is minimal 
[CZI10]. At low loads (100 N), the differences between the steel specimen and the 
coatings are not very pronounced, but the coatings exhibit less friction at the individ-
ual speeds even if the reference changes at slightly lower speeds than the average 
value of the coatings in the hydrodynamic region. First, if the load increases, an im-
provement of the coatings can be detected. The coatings exhibit different frictional 
properties as a function of various loads and temperatures. Figure 7-11 and 7-12 
show the friction properties of the coatings in comparison to the steel reference sam-
ple. The coatings are represented by three curves; each of the curves corresponds to 
the average, minimum, and maximum friction coefficient, respectively. The improve-
ment of friction in comparison to the reference sample can be promoted by several 
factors. The porosity of the coatings possesses an oil retention capacity that favours 
a hydrodynamic pressure at low speeds by separating the two sliding partners faster 
[BAR05]. Additionally, secondary phases, such as magnetite or wustite, which were 
detected in Fe/Mo 50-50 coatings offer further potential for decreasing friction: they 
act as a solid lubricant and exhibit friction-reducing properties [VEN09, BAR05].

Figure 7-11:  Stribeck curves of Fe/Mo 50-50 coatings and a steel reference sample (RT, 100 N) 
The influence of the load on the tribological properties is graphically presented in 
Figure 7-12. At a load of 400 N (5 MPa), the friction coefficients of the coatings are 
closer together than at lower loads. Furthermore, there is a significant improvement 
of the tribological properties compared to the uncoated steel reference. The transition 
from the mixed friction to the liquid friction occurs at lower speeds and lower friction 
coefficients.

In contrast to the machined micro-dimples, no direct correlation between the friction 
and the porosity or structure depth could be recognised over all loads and oil tem-
perature ranges studied. However, the porosity, in the sense of microstructures, ex-
hibits much smaller micro-dimples and the structures with large volumes are propor-
tionally smaller so that the machined micro-dimples have a significantly higher total 
volume of cavities. In these investigations, other factors - such as surface roughness, 
wear patterns, and thermal properties of the materials used - have not been consid-

Tribological mechanisms of microstructures

ered, but the samples were prepared identically and were assumed to have equal 
surface conditions. 
Tribological properties of the FeCr13 coatings 
The FeCr13 coatings were made analogously to the Fe/Mo 50-50 coatings and were 
identically prepared and tested. The run of the individual Stribeck curves of the 
FeCr13 coatings also lies within a narrow interval (figure 7-13). 
Figure 7-13:  Stribeck curves of the FeCr13 coatings at 60 °C oil temperature and a load of 100 N 
No direct correlation between the friction behaviour and the porosity or structure 
depth could be discerned. Nonetheless, surface analysis of the subproject 4 "Surface 
characterisation based on optical metrology" in connection with the friction coeffi-
cients of FeCr13 coatings reveal that there is, indeed, a friction dependency on the 
porosity - if a porosity threshold of about 200 μm² is set, i.e., if pores having a smaller 
area are hidden. At almost any speed, low friction coefficients are obtained at a high 
pore volume [HUE11]. However, other parameters - such as roughness and loading 
pressure - are not considered in this context. Nevertheless, the tendency that an in-
crease of the micro-dimples proportion may favour the development of the hydrody-
namic pressure corresponds to the results of the machined micro-dimples. 
Figure 7-14 shows that, in comparison to the Fe/Mo 50-50 coatings, the reference 
sample exhibits lower friction coefficients than some of the FeCr13 coatings, espe-
cially at lower loads. Similarly, the FeCr13 coatings switch to the state of the mixed 
friction into the hydrodynamic state at lower speeds. At higher loads and higher oil 
temperatures, the coatings show lower friction coefficients than the uncoated steel 
sample, independently of the speed. The following figure shows the tribological be-
haviour of FeCr13 coatings compared to steel sample with an oil temperature of 60 ° 
C and a load of 100 N.

Figure 7-14:  Stribeck curves of FeCr13 coatings and a steel reference sample (60 °C oil tempera-
ture, 100 N). 
The tribological tests at 60 °C oil temperature show that, with increasing load, the 
steel sample reveals a higher friction coefficient in comparison to the coatings. 
Overall, the FeCr13 coatings exhibit slightly higher friction coefficients than the Fe/Mo 
50-50 coatings. The differences may be due to the secondary phases, which are as-
sumed to act as solid lubricants. In fact, in the FeCr13 coatings, the detected iron ox-
ide magnetite exhibits positive tribological characteristics which are almost equal to 
those of wustite.  
Tribological properties of the FeCr13/Mo 50-50 coatings 
In the studies of the FeCr13/Mo 50-50 coatings, which were also used for the other 
tribological tests, several aspects that can have an effect on the tribological behav-
iour of the pin specimens were studied. Therefore, round specimens with a diameter 
of 10 mm were made of S235 and coated afterwards. Before and after the experi-
ments, the surfaces of the pin specimens were measured using a confocal optical 
microscope VHX-1000 (Keyence, Neu-Isenburg). These measurements aimed to de-
termine whether, during the experiments, the entire pin surface or only some of its 
areas were in contact with the counter disc. Different areas can result in different sur-
face pressures, and thus, cause different behaviour. Before the experiments were 
carried out, three roughness profiles were measured on each pin by an optical 
roughness instrument and averaged. The values are listed in Table 7-1.

In general, the roughness values of the coatings and the cast iron sample are similar; 
however, the coatings exhibit slightly higher values due to their porosity. Moreover, in 
these experiments, the Stribeck curves of the coatings are within a narrow interval. 
Figure 7-15 shows that, in the case of the Fe/Mo 50-50 experiments, the coated 
samples generally comprise the turning point of the mixed friction in the hydrodynam-
ic friction samples at lower speeds. In addition, the minimal friction coefficient is lower 
than for the cast iron reference. The following figure also shows the mean (sample 
FeCr13/Mo-01 was excluded) as well as minimum and maximum friction coefficients.

°C oil temperature, 300 N) 

136 
Tribological mechanisms of microstructures 
Moreover, with this coating system, no significant differences between the individual 
coatings could be observed. However, sample 1 is characterised by a curve which 
differs from those of the other samples (Figure 7-16). The friction coefficients for each 
speed are much higher than those for the rest of the coatings and the reference 
sample. In addition, the Stribeck curve of the coating FeCr13/Mo-01 exhibits an atyp-
ical course in the hydrodynamic friction state, as its friction coefficient does not in-
crease again at higher speeds. Normally, the increase at higher velocities is caused 
by high shear forces in the engine oil [CZI10]. 
 
Figure 7-16:  Comparison between sample FeCr13/Mo 50-50 and the mean friction coefficient of 
the coatings 
A comparison of the pin surfaces after the tribological tests reveals that the contact 
area of the sample FeCr13/Mo-01 is considerably smaller than the contact areas of 
the other samples. Figure 7-17 provides a comparison between the contact areas of 
the FeCr13/Mo-01 and the FeCr13/Mo-03 samples. In the latter, the contact surface 
(red dotted line) comprises almost the entire pin surface; only the edge region does 
not show hints of wear, which indicates crowning of the pins due to the preparation 
process.

In this series of samples, the major factors influencing the friction were examined. 
Using three selected samples, the different friction coefficients of the coatings are 
discussed. Figure 7-18 shows three FeCr13/Mo 50-50 coatings compared to the cast 
iron reference. In this case, the sample with the lowest porosity (FeCr13/Mo-05) has 
the best frictional properties, whereas the sample with the highest porosity 
(FeCr13/Mo-04) provides the turning point into the hydrodynamic friction state at 
higher speeds. 
 
Figure 7-18: Selected Stribeck curves of the FeCr13/Mo 50-50 coatings 
However, the sample FeCr13/Mo-04 exhibits the lowest roughness of all three coat-
ings. Thus, the sample FeCr13/Mo-04 combines the two conflicting factors high po-
rosity and low roughness, so there are other factors that have a decisive influence on 
the friction coefficient. When considering the wear marks on the surface, it can be 
seen that, after the experiments, all three layers are characterised by different con-
tact surfaces (Figure 7-19). The sample with the best frictional properties has the 
largest contact surface, while the sample with the smallest contact surface has a 
highest friction coefficient.

Tribological properties of Mo/NiCrBSi: 
The tribometer pins of the Mo/NiCrBSi 75-25 coatings were measured by means of 
confocal light microscopy before and after the experiments, similar to the FeCr13/Mo 
50-50 samples, in order to examine the real surface during the tribological loading. 
For this purpose, three roughness profiles were recorded and averaged for each 
sample (Table 7-2).

Overall, the curves exhibit a tribological behaviour similar to that of the other coating 
materials. The comparison between the Mo/NiCrBSi 75-25 coatings and the cast iron 
reference also shows an improvement of the frictional properties of the coatings. In 
the field of hydrodynamic friction, the reference and coating system have almost the 
same friction coefficient. Nonetheless, the turning point from the mixed friction to the 
state of hydrodynamic friction occurs at lower speeds, as is the case with the other 
coating systems. The mean, as well as the minimum and maximum, friction coeffi-
cients are shown in Figure 7-20.

Figure 7-20:  Stribeck curves of Mo/NiCrBSi 75-25 coatings and a cast iron reference sample (60 
°C oil temperature, 300 N). 
In the case of this coating material, no direct correlation between the porosity and the 
friction could be discerned directly. Thus, three curves were selected as an example, 
and their impact factors - analysed. Figure 7-21 shows three curves with different po-
rosities. The sample with the highest porosity, Mo/NiCrBSi-03, has the lowest friction 
coefficient, whereas the sample with the lowest porosity, Mo/NiCrBSi-09, has a high-
er friction coefficient at a low speed and changes into the state of liquid friction at a 
higher speed. By comparison, sample Mo/NiCrBSi-06, which has nearly the same po-
rosity as Mo/NiCrBSi-09, exhibits improved friction properties. Therefore, it can be 
assumed that, even in this coating system, the porosity plays a subordinate role. 
 
Figure 7-21:  Selected Stribeck curves of the Mo/NiCrBSi 75-25 coatings 
When compared to the FeCr13/Mo 50-50 coatings, the contact surface of the pins in 
this sample series has an important influence on the friction behaviour. Figure 7-22 
shows the pin surfaces of the three samples. Once again, the sample with the lowest 
contact surface, Mo/NiCrBSi-09, is characterised by the highest friction coefficients, 

140 
Tribological mechanisms of microstructures 
and the sample with the largest contact area, Mo/NiCrBSi-03, shows the lowest fric-
tion coefficients.

Conclusion 
Through all experiments, the coatings exhibit enhanced frictional properties as com-
pared to uncoated steel or cast iron surfaces. Both molybdenum and chromium ox-
ides cause a significant increase in hardness. This can also lead to a positive effect 
regarding the frictional properties [MOK82]. In addition, secondary phases, such as 
magnetite and wustite, improve the friction characteristics as these can act as solid 
lubricants [VEN09]. In comparison to the reference samples, the potential for using 
the microstructures to build up a hydrodynamic pressure and additionally use the mi-
crostructures as an oil retention capacity can be exploited by thermal spray coatings 
[BAR05]. Due to the lamellar structure of the coatings, a new microstructured surface 
with the same properties is exposed after wear. After the experiments in the motor oil 
bath, which were followed by a cleaning, oil residue remained in the cavities while the 
reference samples could be cleaned completely. Experiments at different loads and 
oil temperatures showed that, at low loads, the differences between the friction coef-
ficients of the uncoated steel sample, the iron-molybdenum mixture, and the chromi-
um steel coatings are minimal. Due to the coatings, significant improvements can be 
observed at increasing loads only. The coatings which were made by an internal 
coating process also showed enhanced properties in comparison to an uncoated cast 
iron sample. This is due to their switch in the range of the liquid friction at a lower 
speed. This can also lead to a positive effect regarding the frictional properties 
[MOK82]. No significant differences between the single coatings of a material, which 
exhibit different porosities, could be discerned. Therefore, it can be assumed that the 
amount of porosity does not influence the reduction of friction directly. Micrographs of 
the pins, which were taken after the tribological experiments, reveal that sometimes 
different frictional behaviour can be explained by the different sizes of the contact 
surfaces during the experiments. With decreasing contact surfaces, the surface pres-
sure increases. Brush marks after the experiments reveal the abrasive wear charac-
ter of the coatings.

Piston ring friction results for hybrid cylinder liners  
Within this subproject, hybrid surface topographies were experimentally investigated 
with the piston ring friction test rig, which was first used within the scope of subproject 
³0HWKRGVDQGPRGHOVIRUWKHGHVLJQRIPLFURVWUXFWXUHV´. Hybrid surface structures 
are structures which exhibit deterministic and stochastic patterns at the same time. 
The fundamental idea in identifying the tribological properties of hybrid structures is 
to characterise deterministic and stochastic effects separately. For this purpose, two 
liners were friction-tested on the piston friction test rig. In a first step, both liners were 
coated at IW and then friction tested. In a second step, both liners were structured at 
IFW and then friction tested a second time. 
 
Figure 7-23: Friction force measurements of hybrid surface structures at the piston-ring friction 
test rig 
Figure 7-23 shows speed and load dependent friction force values for hybrid surface 
structures. It is apparent that structured surfaces exhibit small advantages with re-
spect to friction; however, no significant friction reduction can be discerned from the 
measurements shown. 
Tribological test results for structured and coated cylinder liners  
To determine the friction properties of coated surfaces at high speeds, the rotational 
friction measurement test rig (RRV) was used. In this test facility, the tested liner ro-
tates around a piston ring carrier pressing three ring segments, each 120° apart, with 
a known force to the liner surface. The rig was designed to maintain high constant 
speeds over long periods of time; for this purpose, the axial motion of the piston ring 
was transformed into a rotational motion. To ensure realistic material combinations 
and contact conditions, specially designed ring segments and liners were used.

Figure 7-24: Design of the SRV and RRV tribometric test rig 
The influence of the porosity of the coated surfaces on the friction behaviour was de-
termined by means of the RRV rig. Cylinder liners were coated with variable porosi-
ties by IW (see Figure 7-25). 
 
Figure 7-25:  Porosity values for cylinder liners (Coating by IW) 
Figure 7-26 shows the friction coefficient in relation to the sliding speed for different 
cylinder liners.The presented friction values are similar to each other even though, 
compared to the other liners, liners dfg_2 and dfg_9 show significantly lower friction 
values. The results shown here, however, are not conclusive because grooves from 
honing are considered to overlay the test results.

Wear investigations 
This work aimed to determine the influence of the microstructures on the wear. SRV-
tribometer tests were conducted on stochastic and deterministic micro patterns and 
compared to a reference probe. The test conditions - kept constant for all tests ± 
were as follows. 
Test Conditions: 
x Normal Force = 100 N 
x Frequency = 50 Hz 
x Temperature = 100 °C 
x Stroke = 1 mm 
x Oil grade = 5W30 
Precise measurements of the surface topography were essential for the success of 
the investigations. Thus, after a predetermined time period, the test specimen had to 
be dismounted from the test rig, measured, re-mounted, and tested once again. Fig-
ure 7-27 compares the test results for deterministically structured surfaces to that for 
a reference specimen without micro-dimples. All probes were fabricated from the 
same material, and their surfaces were structured at IFW. The results for the struc-
tured surfaces remain similar to each other but differ significantly from the wear re-
sults of the reference probe. This means that the wear increases when the number of 
micro-dimples increases.

Figure 7-27:  SRV-wear results for structured surfaces 
Figure 7-28 shows the wear measurements for coated surfaces relative to the refer-
ence probe. When compared to the reference, coated samples exhibit very good 
wear resistance. This result can be used in further work on the combination of sur-
face micro-structuring and coating so that both friction and wear can be optimised.  
 
Figure 7-28:  SRV-wear results for coated surfaces 
Derivation of a wear model 
The derivation of a theoretical wear model was a major objective of this work. A non-
linear regression was used to derive a functional relationship between wear depth 
and test time for structured surfaces as an optimum fit to test results. The model 
function chosen, a hyperbolic tangent, is capable of capturing the increased wear 
during initial running-in, along with a subsequently decreased wear rate as present in 
the test data. For long wear tests, this function would need to be complemented by a 
linear function in time to cover the constant slope wear behaviour, typically seen after 
the running in phase is completed.

Conclusion 
To quantify the potential for lower friction of hybrid surface structures, tests were 
conducted on a piston ring friction test rig. The test results indicate that structured 
surfaces are characterised by lower friction coefficients. 
The influence of porosity on friction was tested by means of the RRV test rig; howev-
er, the test results could not identify a significant difference between the friction be-
haviour of honed and structured surfaces. 
Tests were carried out to determine the influence of the surface structuring and coat-
ing on the wear characteristics. The test results indicate a significant increase in wear 
for structured surfaces relative to the surface of the reference and the coated sam-
ples. In addition, a regression analysis was employed to develop a theoretical wear 
model that can be refined in future work.

8.1 Objective and approach 
After joining the research group in 2009, the Institute of Technical Combustion built 
up and evaluated an engine test bench for testing microstructured cylinder liners un-
der realistic engine conditions. The entire test bench - including peripherals such as 
supply facilities, measurement data acquisition devices, and automatic control tech-
nique - was specifically built this project.  
8.2 Engine test bench and cylinder liners 
The engine test bench consists of a single cylinder, heavy-duty research engine (die-
sel) based on the Mercedes-Benz series 500. Until recently, this engine type was 
used as a V8 in heavy trucks. The single cylinder engine with its test bench periph-
erals, the technical data of the engine, and the engine map can be seen in Figure 8-
1. 
 
Figure 8-1: Single cylinder test bench and engine map 
Compared to the original model, the single cylinder engine was modified and 
equipped with a mass balancing system up to the 2nd order to guarantee smooth run-
ning. In order to run the engine with a state-of-the-art combustion process, a modern 
Common-Rail high-pressure fuel system was adopted to the engine. In order to min-
imise the influence of interferences, it is necessary to remove the auxiliary devices 
from the engine. Thus, peripheral devices - such as a high pressure fuel system and 
conditioning systems for oil and coolant - were designed and built. In addition, these 
devices ensured defined operation conditions due to accurate control and monitoring

with its control algorithms for the Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (IMEP) and 
combustion burn rates, the FI2RE provides stable and constant engine operation 
points. 
During the measurement campaign, the same piston from a MTU series 2000 engine 
was used. It is equipped with two compression rings (keystone and rectangular) and 
one oil control ring (bevelled edge) with a coil spring. 7KHVRFDOOHG³ZHWF\OLQGHUOLn-
HUV´RIWKHMercedes-Benz series engine were used. To provide constant boundary 
conditions, new piston rings and new engine oil were used for every test run. All other 
engine parts remained the same. A run-in program of 7 hours was carried out with 
every cylinder liner. After that, the friction of the engine was determined for the opera-
tion points shown in Figure 8-1. The following types of cylinder liner surfaces were 
investigated during the project: 
x plateau honed (original Mercedes-Benz liner, reference #1), 
x fine honed (reference #2), 
x covered with machined microstructures and 
x covered with coated microstructures. 
The friction reducing properties of microstructured cylinder liners were evaluated on 
the basis of both the plateau honed liner and the fine honed liner. Every microstruc-
tured liner has fine honed base surface. The machined structures were manufactured 
on pre fine honed liners and the coated ones were fine honed after the thermal spray 
process. Figure 8-2 shows the investigated liners in an overview.

transfer to the cylinder wall. Both temperatures were controlled to be constant-
ly 80°C ± 1 K at the inlet of the engine.  
2. Pressure (relative) 
The oil pressure of all oil circuits was controlled to be constantly at 4 bar ± 
0.05 bar. The air pressure was adjusted from 1.25 bar (at an IMEP of 3.8 bar) 
to 2.05 bar (at an IMEP of 15.5 bar). The exhaust gas back pressure was ad-
justed to be always 200 mbar above the intake pressure.  
3. Operating fluids 
Commercial Diesel fuel (EN 590) and oil from type SAE 10W-40 (Avia TUR-
BOSYNTH HT-E) were used. 
4. Further boundary conditions 
Each operation point was held until all parameters reached a constant state. 
The load (IMEP) was adjusted by the research engine control unit in such a 
way that WKHPDVVIUDFWLRQEXUQWSRLQWĮQ50) was stable at 10° crank an-
gle (CA) after Top Dead Centre (TDC). All measurements were averaged over 
200 cycles to reduce the influence of stochastic fluctuations.  
8.3 Methods to measure friction losses and oil emissions  
In order to measure the friction losses, the indication method was applied. Here, the 
measurement of the CA resolved cylinder pressure pcyl and the integration over one 
whole engine cycle results in the Indicated Mean Effective Pressure IMEP. The 
measurement of the torque Te at the engine output allows determining the Break 
Mean Effective Pressure BMEP. The difference of both values is the Friction Mean 
Effective Pressure FMEP, being a measure of the mechanical losses of the engine:

The measurement of the cylinder pressure was carried out with a water cooled Kistler

The measurements of the oil emissions were performed in cooperation with the ³Insti-
tut für Messtechnik´ of the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg. Unburned oil, 
and thus unburned hydrocarbons, are limited by emission laws. As structured liners 
may lead to an enhanced amount of oil on the liner surface, it is necessary to control 
the lubricant oil emissions. Thus, apart from friction and wear, oil emissions are an-
other important factor to be taken into consideration when regarding the tribological 
optimisation of cylinder liner systems. For the measurement of the oil emissions, a 
mass spectrometer - which had been developed in earlier projects [FVV03, FVV07] 
and which had been adapted for the application on test engines - was used. The 
separation of the unburned hydrocarbons from the lubricant oil from those of the die-
sel fuel was done with a quadrupole filter. The system allows the direct evaluation of 
the measurement signal. The reproducibility of the measurements depends on the oil 
concentration. The statistical deviation, indicated by the standard deviation, ranges 
from 2 to 12 % depending on the concentration level [KRA09]. Figure 8-3 shows the 
experimental setup.

8.4 Measurement uncertainty  
A measurement model was developed in order to determine the measurement uncer-
tainty of the discussed indication method as well as the error influence of the in-
cylinder indication and of the torque measurement (Figure 8-4).  The measurement 
uncertainties were determined according to the regulations of the ³Deutsche Akkredi-
WLHUXQJVVWHOOH´The maximum mean absolute error for the determination of the Fric-
tion Mean Pressure FMEP was determined from the geometrical addition of the indi-
vidual errors to be ±0.03 bar (2 V).

The following aspects were investigated by validating the method of determining the 
frictional losses: 
x deviation,  
x reproducibility and  
x influence of the engine assembly on the FEMP determination. 
Deviation 
The deviation of the FEMP determination was investigated by testing 6 cylinder liners 
under the same conditions. For this purpose, 3 original liners with a plateau honed 
surface and 3 fine honed liners were used. Compared to the rest of the investigated 
liners, two of them (one original and one fine honed liner) showed higher deviations 
regarding FMEP than the expected measurement uncertainty. These liners were re-
garded as outliers and were not included the following investigation. Figure 8-5

Figure 8-5: Deviation of FMEP 
Regarding the original liners, the deviations were less than the expected measure-
ment uncertainty in almost every engine operation point. An increase of the load cor-
relates with an increase of the deviation, whereas the high deviation at 1300 1/min and 
19.4 bar IMEP can be regarded as an outlier because of a not swung-in engine state. 
The maximum deviation of 0.05 bar FMEP was determined for 1600 1/min and 15.5 
bar IMEP. In 16 of 22 engine operation points, the fine honed liners showed devia-
tions smaller the measurement uncertainty. In the remaining points, the deviation 
ranges between 0.04 and 0.12 bar FEMP. The slightly higher deviations might be 
caused by differing surface characteristics due to the hone process which was car-
ried out by a contractor company.  
Reproducibility 
The reproducibility of the FMEP determination was investigated by means of a re-
peated start of the engine. For that purpose, the engine was operated under fired 
conditions at 1300 1/min und 11.6 bar IMEP with a fine honed liner. The FMEP was 
determined after the start of the engine and a swing-in period. Following, the engine

and its peripherals were stopped for a defined short period in order to cool down and 
subsequently restarted. Figure 8-6 shows the determined FMEP values for the sev-
eral test runs. It can be noticed that the reproducibility is excellent.

Influence of engine assembling 
In order to investigate the influence of the assembling of the engine on the friction, a 
test run was carried out using a microstructured cylinder liner. After a run-in program 
and a preliminary FMEP determination, the liner ±together with the liner housing and 
the piston assembly± was completely disassembled and put back together again. All 
screws and engine parts were tightened as per instructions. In this regard, the tight-
ening of the cylinder head bolts is of significant importance, as it causes a defor-
mation of the cylinder liner and its housing. This, in turn, can lead to increased out-of-
roundness. Therefore, keeping the boundary conditions regarding the engine assem-
bly constant was mandatory in order to ensure a precise FMEP determination. Figure 
8-7 shows the FMEP values of the first and the second test run. 
 
Figure 8-7: Influence of engine assembly on friction (FMEP) determination 
The discrepancies between the two test runs are obvious only at 1800 1/min. In most 
of the operation points, the differences in FMEP range from ±0.01 ± 0.02 bar and are 
therefore within the measurement uncertainty. It can be noticed that, with regard to 
the assembling instructions, assembling and reassembling of the liner does not influ-
ence the FMEP.

8.6 Results: frictional losses 
This section presents and discusses the results regarding the frictional losses of the 
microstructured and coated cylinder liners. The friction (in terms of FMEP) was inves-
tigated for constant load in dependency on the engine speed. Even though test runs 
with microstructured liners were successfully completed, test runs involving the coat-
ed cylinder liners caused significant difficulties.   
In the course of the project, several liners which ±on closer inspection± exhibited sur-
face damages were purchased from the executing honing company. Thus, liner #9, 
for example, showed surface damages in form of scratches in the middle part of the 
liner, most probably caused by the honing process. Consequently, another honing 
company was selected for the renewed purchase of cylinder liners. However, the 
quality of the provided liners, though to some extent better, did not differ significantly. 
Coated cylinder liners for heavy-duty engines with correspondingly bigger bore sizes 
are not common in series application. It can be thus concluded that more detailed 
processing experience is needed to ensure the production of high-quality, durable 
coated liners. Consequently, the development of a modified honing process with an 
adapted mechanical load for coated cylinder liners with big bore sizes is of particular 
interest. 
Another problem concerning the coated liners occurred in the course of this investi-
gation. The test of liner #11 caused a piston seizure during the run-in program. Liner 
#10 caused a piston seizure during the oil emission measurement. Thus, the seized 
piston rings had to be examined. Figure 8-8 shows SEM images of an unused top 
ring and an element line scan of the seized ring used with liner #10 using the energy-
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). 
 
 
Figure 8-8: SEM images of the ring surface and element analysis

The surface of the ring provides a uniform smooth surface with traces of the surface 
treatment. On the basis of a cross-section, it can be seen that the ring is coated. An 
element line scan through the ring, from its edges towards its centre, indicates that 
the coating consists of chromium. Chrome plating is a method commonly used to in-
crease the hardness and scuff resistance of piston rings [SCO75].The following illus-
tration shows the used top ring after scuffing of liner #10. 
 
Figure 8-9: SEM images of a top ring after scuffing with elemental analysis 
Even at low magnification, a second phase with a higher atomic mass can be seen 
on the ring surface. At higher magnifications, it can be seen that the second phase 
EXLOGVDQLUUHJXODUµUHHI¶ on the piston ring. Element analysis of this reef shows that it 
is composed of the coating material FeCr13/Mo 50/50, which was applied to the liner. 
Presumably, this is the result of a friction weld between the chromium-containing fric-
tion partners. Under certain friction and hot-gas conditions, chromium can soften and 
therefore tends to scuff [SCO75]. In this case, the scuffing of the liners occurred on 
two sockets, which were honed by different manufacturers and with different surface 
quality; this leads to the conclusion that the surface quality is another factor which 
can influence the scuffing liability. 
Due to this problem, an alternative to the chromium-plated rings was needed. Unfor-
tunately, suitable piston rings matching the geometry of the piston grooves could not 
be found. Therefore, only three coated cylinder liners can be presented in this report. 
Comparison between the reference liners: plateau and fine honed 
Two types of reference liners were investigated: an original Mercedes-Benz liner with 
a rough, plateau honed surface (Rz = 6 μm) and a fine honed liner with a surface 
roughness less than 1 μm Rz. Figure 8-10 shows the determined friction loss (in 
terms of FMEP values) as the arithmetic mean of two samples for each liner type. 
The higher surface roughness of the original liner leads to increased mixed friction 
areas, whereas - due to the smoother surface - the fine honed liner shows significant-
ly less friction losses. When comparing the mean frictional benefit over all engine op-
eration points, the fined honed liner shows about 8 % less FMEP compared to the 
original liner. In particular at low engine speeds, the frictional losses are reduced by 
13 ± 14 %. Because of the fine honed surface, lower oil retention properties and, 

156 
Test of cylinder liner under fired engine conditions 
therefore, increased wear or possibly a piston seizure can be expected. However, no 
damages of the fine honed liners were observed during the entire project. The wear 
of the fine honed and microstructured liners could not be assessed by the engine 
tests. Nonetheless, the specific microstructuring of the fine honed surface was ex-
pected to provide increased oil retention properties and therefore less wear and tear 
even during longer testing periods. 
 
Figure 8-10:  Friction loss (FEMP) of plateau honed compared to fine honed liner 
Microstructures in dead centre areas 
The piston dead centres and especially the Top Dead Centre (TDC) are the most 
stressed areas along the cylinder liner surface. There, the piston velocity is equal to 
zero, and consequently, the hydrodynamic pressure built-up collapses. Therefore, the 
piston rings cannot be completely separated from the liner surface by the lubricant, 
which leads to increased mixed friction effects. Due to the load of the cylinder pres-
sure and the high temperatures form the burnt gases, the thermo-mechanical stress 
is considerably higher in TDC than in Bottom Dead Centre (BDC). On diesel engines, 
in particular, this leads to an increased liner wear at TDC. 
Therefore, cylinder liners were manufactured with microstructures in TDC (liner #3) 
and in both dead centre areas (liner #7). It was expected that the microstructures 
would increase the oil retention capacity on the liner surface, leading to an increased 
hydrodynamic pressure built-up and, thus, to lower friction. The determined FMEP 
values, as shown in Figure 8-11, confirmed this theory. The liner with microstructures 
in the TDC area, in particular, showed the lowest frictional losses throughout the 
whole investigation. Compared to an original liner, the FMEP was up to 19 % lower at 
1600 1/min and 15.5 bar IMEP. FMEP also showed dependency on the engine speed: 

Test of cylinder liner under fired engine conditions 
157 
the operation points with the lowest friction were at 1600 ± 1800 1/min. There, the fric-
tional losses were considerably lower even compared to the fine honed reference.  
Compared to an original liner, cylinder liner #7, which was microstructured in both 
dead centre areas, showed reduced frictional losses as well. However, the benefit is 
lower than those of liner #3. At engine speeds ranging from 1600 ± 2000 1/min, the de-
termined FMEP values were on a similar level as the fine honed reference. At lower 
engine speeds, the frictional losses showed a slight increase.  
 
Figure 8-11:  Effect of microstructures in TDC and BDC 

158 
Test of cylinder liner under fired engine conditions 
The performed investigation shows that ±as expected± microstructures in the dead 
centre areas of the cylinder liner lead to considerably lower frictional losses com-
pared to those of an original liner. The frictional differences of the two liner types can 
be explained with the density of microstructures per area unit. The microstructures of 
liner #3 were manufactured with an axial distance f = 0.3 mm; their density is 40 % 
higher when compared to the one of liner #7. As a result, the oil retention capacity of 
the thermo-mechanical highly stressed TDC area is higher, which leads to lower fic-
tional losses. Due to the fact that the microstructures act as a lubricant reservoir, it 
seems possible that the oil transport on the liner surface is also affected. However, if 
and to what extend this fact can be an explanation for the measured FMEP depend-
ence on the engine speed could not be revealed during this project.  
Microstructures in areas of hydrodynamic lubrification 
Derived from the fundamentals of tribology, the Stribeck curve describes the coeffi-
cient of friction as a function of the relative velocity of two friction partners and the 
normal force. According to the Stribeck curve, an increase in relative velocity leads to 
a higher friction coefficient due to fluid friction. Regarding the tribology of the piston 
cylinder sleeve group, the piston velocity reaches its maximum in the middle part of 
the piston stroke. Thus, predominantly fluid friction can be expected in the middle 
part of the cylinder liner. 
Experiments using a tribometer (see chapter 7.1) examined the above presented cir-
cumstances for cold boundary conditions. In order to investigate whether the same 
results can be achieved in a fired engine, a cylinder liner with microstructures in the 
hydrodynamic area was manufactured. In comparison to the reference liners, an in-
crease in friction was expected due to the increasing engine speed, and therefore, 
due to the higher piston velocities. 
The microstructures were manufactured with a very low axial distance of f = 0.2 mm 
in order to enhance the density of the microstructures per area unit, and thus, to in-
crease the oil retention capacity of the surface. Figure 8-12 shows the determined 
FMEP values. As expected, the frictional losses show a significant dependency on 
the engine speed. At lower engine speed, the frictional losses are lower than those 
characteristic of the original liner. With an increase of the engine speed, the friction 
rises considerably. This effect can be noticed in all diagrams.  
Moreover, in all engine operation points, liner #4 exhibits FMEP values higher than 
those of the fine honed reference. The investigation showed that ±apart from a de-
crease± an increase of friction due to an enhancement of fluid friction is also possi-
ble.

Figure 8-12: Effect of microstructures on hydrodynamic lubrication 
Influence of the structure density on friction  
It was expected that increasing the density of the microstructures would result in an 
increase of the friction loss due to the higher oil retention capacity in the hydrody-
namic area of the line surface. Basically, liner #5 and #6 can be regarded as a com-

measurements described above, it was expected that increasing the density of the 
microstructures would increase the friction loss in the hydrodynamic range where the 
piston velocity is high. However, the measured values do not confirm this theory. De-
spite the increased density of its microstructures, liner #6 showed lower friction loss-
es. Unfortunately it was not possible to carry out more tests in order to find satisfacto-

160 
Test of cylinder liner under fired engine conditions 
ry explanations for the measured trends during this project. Investigating this issue by 
means of additional tests would be a challenging further project. 
 
Figure 8-13:  Influence of the structure density on friction 
Thermal spray coatings 
Figure 8-14 shows the results of the measured friction for five liners; three out of 
those five had coated surfaces (#8, #9, #10). Compared to the reference liner #1, the 
coated liner #8 shows reduced friction for low load and for lower engine speeds. The 
other two coated liners, #9 and #10, exhibit a similar trend as well. However, for 
higher load and speed, their friction is higher than that of reference #1. In some cas-

Test of cylinder liner under fired engine conditions 
161 
es, the friction of liner #9 was up to 10 % higher than that of the reference liner. It 
should be noted here that even before the engine tests, liner #9 showed some minor 
damage in form of radial grooves, possibly caused by the honing process which was 
carried out after the coating. It is likely that this damage induced the higher friction. 
The fine honed liner #2 was characterised by the lowest friction in nearly all meas-
urement points.  
 
Figure 8-14:  Friction of coated cylinder liner 
A definite conclusion regarding the influence of the coating on the friction of liners #9 
and #10 could not be made. On the one hand, the coated liners often showed dam-

162 
Test of cylinder liner under fired engine conditions 
ages: liner #9 was damaged even before the start of the engine tests, whereas liner 
#10 showed strong seizure problems during the later experiments (oil emission 
measurements). On the other hand, the coatings were applied to the whole surface of 
the liner. The above-described experiments with the microstructured liners show that 
the location of the structured surface can have both positive and negative effects on 
friction. Due to the high effort needed for the coating process and the difficulties ex-
perienced in the final honing stages, further ±more detailed± experiments with the 
coated liners could not be conducted in course of this project.  
The influence of the porosity could not be investigated due to the same reasons. 
Nonetheless, it can be expected that higher porosity of the liner surface, and corre-
spondingly, increased amount of oil would lead to reduced friction, at least in the re-
gions near the dead centres.  
8.7 Results: oil emission 
Additionally to the measurement of friction, a series of experiments was conducted to 
investigate the emissions resulting from the lubricating oil. Since microstructuring the 
surface results in an enhanced amount of oil in the structured part of the liner, it had 
to be investigated whether this would lead to an increased amount of unburned oil 
which results in hydrocarbons (HC) and particles (soot). As these emissions are lim-
ited by law, an investigation of the dependency of the liner surface on oil emissions is 
of high importance. A mass spectrometer as described above was used. Hereafter, 
the oil emissions are discussed for the liner shown in Figure 8-15. No results can be 
shown for liner #10, as this liner experienced seizure problems during the measure-
ments.

Figure 8-15:  Overview of the tested liners regarding oil emissions 
Figure 8-16 shows the oil emission measurement results for the lower load condi-
tions. The highest oil emission values are found for the plateau honed series produc-
tion liner (#1). The oil emissions of this liner depend strongly on the engine speed as 
well. The fine honed liner (as a second reference) shows significantly lower oil emis-
sion, with a reduction factor up to 9. This may be attributed to its surface which is 
much smoother than that of the plateau honed liner. The microstructured liners show 
a somewhat higher oil emission than the fine honed liner. However, even their oil 
emissions are much lower than those of the series production liner.

Figure 8-16:  Oil emission in relation of liner surface at low engine load 
Figure 8-17 shows oil emissions measured for higher load. Here, the oil emissions of 
the microstructured liners were partly higher compared to the plateau honed series 
liner. The completely structured liner (#5) exhibits higher oil emission at low engine 
speeds; consequently, the amount of oil on the liner structure is even higher and 
leads to enhanced oil emissions. The same applies to the partly structured liner (#3) 
for high engine speed. No measurement values are available for liners #5 und #8 for 
the operation points with 2000 1/min, as the measurement system failed to measure 
here.

Figure 8-17:  Oil emission in relation of liner surface at high engine load 
In summary, the oil consumption level is still in the range of the series production lin-
er and not far outside of it. The measurements suggest that oil emissions are not sig-
nificantly enhanced by the microstructures. For lower loads, emissions are signifi-
cantly reduced; for high loads, the emissions are to some extend higher than the ref-
erence values, but the amount is not outstanding. So far, compared to the series 
production liner, the oil emission does not seem to be influenced the microstructured 
liner systems significantly. 
8.8 Conclusion 
During the course of this project, microstructured cylinder liners were investigated 
under fired conditions within a single cylinder research engine. To measure the me-
chanical friction loss, the indication method was applied. Thus, the difference of the 
Indicated Mean Effective Pressure inside the cylinder and the Brake Mean Effective 
Pressure at the output shaft was determined. In extensive pilot tests, the measure-

Test of cylinder liner under fired engine conditions 
165 
ment technique was validated. It was shown that the discrepancies between different 
similarly produced liners and the influence of mounting were negligibly low and that 
the repeatability for the same operation conditions was good. With the help of a 
measurement model, the maximum measurement error was estimated at ± 0.03 bar 
 ı FEMP. All measurements in the fired engine were performed within a wide 
range of the engine operation map. The cooling water as well as the oil circuit of the 
engine was conditioned to hold defined temperatures on a constant level in order to 
provide constant boundary conditions. The engine oil and the piston rings were 
changed before each measurement of a new liner. Each liner was operated accord-
ing to the same defined operation program (7 h running-in program and 3 h meas-
urement).  
As a reference, liner from series production (with rather rough plateau honed surface 
and a RZ-value of 6 μm) was used. Additionally, a fine honed liner (RZ-value < 1 μm) 
was taken as second reference, as the microstructured liners were based on such 
fine honed surfaces. For both types of reference, three liners were compared. Two of 
each gave consistently repeatable results concerning the friction losses while one of 
each reference liner showed significant deviations. These liners were marked as out-
liers and not taken into consideration during the further investigation. The fine honed 
liner showed 8 % less friction than the liner from series production. 
Two types of micro structures were investigated: machined microstructures and coat-
ed surfaces with microstructuring through a defined porosity of the surface. 
In the case of the machined microstructured liners, a variation of the structures was 
investigated; previous measurements on a tribometer as well as numerical simula-
tions found this variation most promising. Here, a relatively small depth of the micro-
structures of typically 7 μm and distances between the structure lines in the range of 
0.2 and 1 mm was selected. A variation of this distance on liners with microstructures 
along the whole liner surface could not provide a clear answer to the question which 
distance gives the best results. Possibly, different concurrent tribological effects over-
lap in this case, as both mixed friction and hydrodynamic friction regimes are con-
cerned.  Furthermore, liners where the microstructures were applied only to the dead 
centre areas where investigated. It can be noticed that structures in the region of the 
Top Dead Centre of the piston resulted in a significant reduction of the friction losses 
for a wide range of operation points. Compared to liner from series production, the 
Friction Mean Effective Pressure could be reduced by a maximum of 19 %. The mi-
crostructures provide potentially the retention of the lubricant oil, which is an im-
portant parameter influencing the practical application. Microstructures near the dead 
centre seem suited for the tribological conditions characteristic of this area, e.g., low 
speed of the piston and mixed friction due to displacement of the oil film. The found 
improvement of the tribological friction properties was so far in agreement with ex-
pectation. For further validation of the hypothesis, microstructures were also ar-
ranged in the middle part of the liner where the piston velocity is higher and where 
the hydrodynamic friction exhibits correspondingly greater significance. Based on the 

166 
Test of cylinder liner under fired engine conditions 
Stribeck curves, it was expected here that, analogous to the cold tribological experi-
ments, the friction would increase if the amount of oil situated in this region in-
creased. Indeed, the experiments validated this expectation.  
For the coated microstructured surface of cylinder liners (produced by IW), the friction 
measurement was only partly possible. In some case, technological problems result-
ing from the processing, led to piston seizure problems during the engine tests; thus, 
no detailed answer concerning the effects on the friction could be discerned so far. A 
detailed analysis showed that, in some cases, the final honing procedure taking place 
after the coating process destroyed the coating, or at least, seriously damaged the 
structure. Moreover, seizures between the components of the coating material and 
the compression rings (chrome components) were identified as the underlying cause 
for some of the problems. Nonetheless, compared to liner from series production, at 
least in some of these measurements showed a potential for friction reduction. Thus, 
further research should focus on the technological problems as well as on the optimal 
combination of materials in the liner structure and on the piston rings in order to pro-
vide good tribological results. 
Microstructures in the cylinder liner surface were expected to modify the amount of oil 
and the oil film distribution on the liner. Therefore, it was suspected that structured 
liners may lead to enhanced oil emissions. Thus, the emissions caused by unburned 
oil were measured by means of a mass spectrometer, in cooperation with the Institut 
für Messtechnik from TU Hamburg-Harburg. These measurements detected the long 
chained hydrocarbons resulting from unburned oil in the exhaust section of the en-
gine. Against expectations, it was found out that all investigated microstructured lin-
ers exhibited significantly lower oil emission than the plateau honed liner from series 
production for the low and medium load cases and only slightly enhanced oil emis-
sion for highest load. 
It can be concluded that the realisation of this subproject was essentially successful. 
The operational effort was high, as the tribological investigations under fired engine 
conditions required careful procedure planning to reduce the influence of parasitic ef-
fects and ensure the measurement of the friction effect of the liners. Nevertheless, 
these measurements conducted under realistic fired engine conditions are of signifi-
cant importance for the determination of the application potential of microstructured 
cylinder liners in internal combustion engines.
