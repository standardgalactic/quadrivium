OrderedDict vs dict
à prior to Python 3.6 no guarantee of key insertion order being maintained
à if you must have an ordered dictionary and be backward compatible, must use OrderedDict
à if not, OrderedDict still has a few tricks up its sleeve!
à supports reverse iteration
à pop first or last item in dictionary
à move item to beginning or end of dictionary
makes sense since there is an ordering
functionality not built-in to standard dict
Equality comparison (==) does not behave the same way
dict vs dict comparison
à order of keys does not matter
OrderedDict vs OrderedDict comparison
à order of keys matters
dict vs OrderedDict comparison
à order of keys does not matter
à have to "work" to get that behavior
