Dedication
This book is dedicated to Bill Burk (1933–2008), a Memphis newspaper 
reporter who covered Elvis for over 20 years before founding Elvis World 
magazine. In 13 books on Elvis, Bill specialized in uncovering information 
no one else could get or in fi nding the truth behind the myth. A mentor, 
supporter, and friend to me, Bill Burk is missed in the world of Elvis’s fans, 
writers, and colleagues.

Introduction
E
lvis Presley needs no introduction, but he does need an updated evalua-
tion of his life and career and a sincere appreciation of his contributions 
to popular American music. After years of fan hyperbole, accusations and 
rumors by former friends and associates, and bad jokes about fried banana 
sandwiches, it’s time to give Elvis his due — and that’s just what this book 
does.
Even though Elvis died at age 42, he managed to accomplish more than several 
entertainers combined. Elvis integrated different styles of music to create the 
sound called “rockabilly,” a musical thread that made up the fabric of a then-
new genre referred to as “rock ’n’ roll.” Openly singing the songs of African 
Americans (and properly acknowledging their influence on his sound), Elvis 
helped focus industry and audience attention on blues and R&B. He achieved 
integration musically, but the country struggled with the concept socially.
Drop-dead handsome and charismatic, Elvis parlayed his rock ’n’ roll notoriety 
into movie stardom. A decade later, after a new generation of rock ’n’ rollers 
had forgotten him, and the mainstream press had written him off as obsolete, 
Elvis reinvented himself to take the stage once more to become a 1970s super-
star. Gaudy, glamorous, and glorious, Elvis filled Vegas hotel showrooms and 
huge concert venues with old and new fans who wanted to see a legend.
Elvis’s career evolved through many phases, absorbed a variety of musical 
styles, and involved all arenas of entertainment. Some people are fans of his 
early rock ’n’ roll music; others are fans of his movies; still others prefer the 
gaudy splendor of the Vegas concert performer. Elvis’s widespread appeal 
developed from a diverse career that as the title of one of his albums sug-
gests truly held something for everybody. Likewise, this book about Elvis 
contains something of interest for everyone, whether you’re an Elvis fan, a 
pop culture enthusiast, a lover of indigenous American music, or someone 
looking for a fascinating story about fame and fortune.
Elvis left behind no autobiography, memoirs, or even a definitive interview. 
Throughout much of his career, any interaction with the media was through 
press conferences, which aren’t conducive to revealing personal informa-
tion. As a matter of fact, you could say that Elvis’s approach to the press was 
to conceal information more than to reveal it. Consequently, direct access 
to Elvis’s personal feelings, beliefs, and opinions on any given topic is rare. 
Most of the time, information on his feelings and opinions has come to us 
secondhand through memoirs by former associates and family members, 
many of whom have agendas or, at the very least, fuzzy memories. I have 
made every effort to include Elvis’s perspective on important aspects of his 

2
Elvis For Dummies 
life and career, but in many cases, it just isn’t possible. Ironically, for one of 
the most written-about entertainers of the 20th century, Elvis lacks a direct 
voice in his own story.
About This Book
Elvis For Dummies covers all phases of Elvis’s career, from his musical influ-
ences as a teenager in Memphis and his first recordings for Sun Studio to 
his final concert and continued popularity even in death. All the celebrated 
events that everyone knows about are featured as well — his controversial 
hip-swiveling performing style, the famous Ed Sullivan Show appearance, 
his much-maligned movie career, his marriage to Priscilla Beaulieu, and his 
fascination with jumpsuits. In addition, I shine a spotlight on little-known 
details about his life to provide you with a well-rounded portrait of the 20th 
century’s most famous personality.
Also covered are the anniversary celebrations, memorial events, important 
posthumous record releases, and other post-death phenomena that keep his 
memory alive and introduce his music to new generations. Most importantly, 
I explain the significance of the events of his career, analyze the meaning of 
the music, and put Elvis into a cultural perspective. The question most often 
asked about Elvis is “why.” Why is he still so famous; why does he still sell 
records; why does he continue to draw new fans; and why does he continue 
to be the number-one moneymaking celebrity. By the end of this book, you’ll 
understand why Elvis remains such a presence in our culture.
You don’t need to read this book in chronological order to discover Elvis. 
Though the structure follows the chronology of Elvis’s life, each chapter is 
written to stand on its own. Feel free to select any chapter in any part and 
start reading without worrying about becoming confused. You can move 
around the book as you like, picking your favorite Elvis topics to read first.
Conventions Used in This Book
I use several conventions consistently throughout this book, including the 
following:
 
✓ Most of the time, I refer to Elvis by his first name because the enter-
tainment industry, fans, the media, and average Americans tend to 
recognize him by his first name. Partly because of his level of fame and 
partly because of the uniqueness of his first name, Elvis usually is the 
only name needed. However, when making formal declarations (or just 
for the sake of variety), I sometimes use the full name Elvis Presley and, 
occasionally, Presley.

3
 Introduction
 
✓ Elvis’s longtime manager, Colonel Tom Parker, goes by many names, 
befitting an old-school carnival manager who was always working an 
angle. Like those who knew him, I refer to him as the Colonel, Colonel 
Parker, or simply Parker.
 
✓ When chronicling the success of Elvis’s records, I refer to their chart 
status, which refers to Billboard magazine’s music charts. Billboard has 
been devoted to the music industry since the 1930s, and its charts track 
the popularity of recordings. The methods of calculation have evolved 
with the ever-changing music industry, but the Billboard charts remain 
the standard measure for rating songs in the U.S. The two most impor-
tant charts are the Hot 100, or Top 100, which ranks the top 100 songs, 
and the Billboard 200, formerly called the Top LPs or Top Albums chart, 
which tracks album sales. When I mention that an Elvis song became 
number one, or that he enjoyed many number-one records, I’m referring 
to the first position on the Hot 100.
 
✓ Another measure of success for a recording artist is the number of gold, 
platinum, and multi-platinum records accumulated during a career. The 
Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) awards (or certifies) 
gold, platinum, or multi-platinum status based on the number of records 
sold through retail and other ancillary markets. Certification isn’t auto-
matic, however. The record company must request it and pay to have 
sales of a given album or single audited. To receive gold status, a single 
or album must sell 500,000 units. In 1976, platinum status was instituted 
by the RIAA for albums selling one million units. In 1984, multi-platinum 
status was announced for records that doubled, tripled, or quadrupled 
their platinum amounts. Even though Elvis died in 1977, the Elvis Presley 
Estate and RCA (his record label) asked the RIAA to audit sales of his 
records to keep his statistics up-to-date.
 
✓ I use bold text to highlight key words in bulleted lists.
 
✓ When I introduce a new term that you may not be familiar with, I use 
italics and define the term within the text.
What You’re Not to Read
My fondest hope is that you pore over every word in this book, but if you’re 
short on time (perhaps because you’re busy listening to Elvis’s albums and 
planning your next trip to Graceland), feel free to skip the following:
 
✓ Sidebars: If you’re reading in a hurry or skimming for essential infor-
mation, you can skip over the sidebars, which appear in gray boxes 
throughout the book. Although the information I include in the sidebars 
is fun and interesting, it isn’t essential to the main points.

4
Elvis For Dummies 
 
✓ Any text accompanied by the Trivia icon: You can amaze your friends 
and family with the details of Elvis’s life and career if you read the 
text next to the Trivia icons (see the icon pictures at the end of this 
introduction), but these tidbits aren’t essential to understanding Elvis’s 
importance.
Foolish Assumptions
As I started writing Elvis For Dummies, I made some assumptions about the 
folks who would be interested in this book. First and foremost, I assume the 
obvious — that you’re interested in discovering something about Elvis. I also 
made some other assumptions. Perhaps one of the following applies to you:
 
✓ You recognize Elvis Presley and can sing along to “Jailhouse Rock” or 
another famous tune, but you want to know why he warrants such fame.
 
✓ You have seen dozens of books on Elvis Presley and were looking for the 
one that really explains the meaning of Elvis.
 
✓ You have always wanted to go to Graceland but don’t know what to 
expect.
How This Book Is Organized
Elvis For Dummies is divided into five parts. Four sections relate to the 
phases of Elvis’s career, and one consists of useful reference lists.
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ’n’ Roll
Starting at the beginning with Elvis’s childhood in Tupelo, Mississippi, this 
part discusses the importance of his Southern background in the develop-
ment of his sound. That sound was evident from his very first recordings in 
1954 for tiny Sun Records, a regionally based company owned and operated 
by Sam Phillips. Phillips helped develop Elvis’s musical style, eventually 
dubbed “rockabilly,” which represents the start of Presley’s career. Elvis’s 
regional success led to a nationally based record contract in 1956 with RCA, 
which tweaked his style and called it rock ’n’ roll. Elvis’s association with 
rock ’n’ roll, combined with his unique performing style, created a furor in 
the mainstream press and inflamed the public.

 Introduction
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to 
Hollywood Leading Man
As soon as producer Hal Wallis signed Elvis to a movie contract in 1956, the 
young singer talked about nothing but being a serious actor. His 13-year 
Hollywood career didn’t work out quite the way that he wanted it to, but it 
did help cool the controversy over his musical performing style and change 
his image from notorious rock ’n’ roller to handsome leading man. This part 
chronicles his entire movie career, from the excitement of King Creole to the 
nonsense of Kissin’ Cousins. Typically, Elvis’s film career is criticized because 
much of it consisted of formulaic musical comedies, but I offer a different 
perspective. I acknowledge the good films, dispel misconceptions, and offer a 
context with which to appreciate them.
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage 
to the End of the Road
In 1968, with the help of a well-received television special on NBC, which 
was later referred to as The ’68 Comeback Special, Elvis reinvented himself. 
No longer challenged by the musical comedies he had been pushed into, 
he recorded a critically acclaimed album and then returned to live perfor-
mances in 1969. Eventually, however, the rigors of the road led to a decline in 
his career and his health. This part covers this last phase of his career, from 
a career high point when he premiered his live act at the International Hotel 
in Las Vegas in 1969 to his death in 1977.
Part IV:From the King of Rock ’n’ Roll 
to American Cultural Icon
Death did nothing to change the popularity of Elvis, and this part proves it 
by detailing the many ways (positive and negative) that his memory has been 
kept alive. Each year in Memphis, fans celebrate his life and music on the 
anniversary of his death by visiting important Elvis-related sites such as his 
home, Graceland. Over the years, RCA has constructed Elvis’s legacy based 
on key releases of his historically important music. In addition, more notori-
ous events in his life came to light and focused attention on his personality, 
career, and death. All of this, and more, has combined to keep Elvis in the 
public eye.

Elvis For Dummies 
Part V: The Part of Tens
A trademark feature of the For Dummies series, the Part of Tens contains fun 
and interesting lists of reference-style information. My lists include the obvi-
ous, such as the ten best Elvis songs and the ten best Elvis albums. I also 
include a list of the ten best Elvis moments, which features the high points of 
his life and career that meant the most to Elvis. I round out this part with a 
chapter on ten Elvis-related movies, which are fictional films featuring Elvis 
as a character. Also, don’t forget to check out the appendix, which is a cast of 
characters listing some important people in Elvis’s life.
Icons Used in This Book
In traditional For Dummies style, I have chosen some icons to make accessing 
information even easier. The icons in this book include the following:
 
This icon signals a fascinating fact or an interesting detail that adds dimension 
to the main ideas discussed in a given chapter.
 
This icon highlights an important point that you should remember for the 
future.
 
Like adjectives in a sentence, quotes from Elvis or from people who knew him 
or worked with him add color and an expressive personal perspective.
Where to Go from Here
I organized this book so you can quickly and easily find the information 
you’re looking for. For main topics and key events in Elvis’s life, check out the 
table of contents or index. Because Elvis For Dummies isn’t linear, feel free 
to start anywhere. If you love the Vegas Elvis, start with Chapter 12, which 
describes his triumphant return to the stage; if you’re a rock ’n’ roll rebel, flip 
to Chapter 4 to read about Elvis in 1956 when he tore across the country like 
a hurricane, redefining musical tastes and upsetting the status quo. It doesn’t 
matter where you start; it’s just important that you do.

Part I
From Rockabilly to 
Rock ’n’ Roll

In this part . . .
T
o explore the beginning of Elvis Presley’s musical 
career is to explore the development of rock ’n’ roll 
and its impact on our culture.
With Sam Phillips, the owner-operator of Sun Records, 
Elvis developed rockabilly, a cornerstone of rock ’n’ roll. 
And then he introduced it to a nationally based audience 
that didn’t know what to make of the singer, his music, or 
his performing style. This part goes back to Elvis’s youth 
to reveal his inspirations and then follows his path from 
Sun Studio, where he cut his first record in 1954, through 
his controversial performances on national television to 
his stint in the army in 1958.

Chapter 1
Introducing Elvis Presley
In This Chapter
▶ Outlining Elvis’s place in American history
▶ Summarizing Elvis’s life
▶ Tracking Elvis’s popularity from beginning to end
O
n the one hand, Elvis Presley needs no introduction, because his name 
and face are recognized around the world as the ultimate celebrity. 
Imitators re-create his act; late-night comedians joke about him; cable chan-
nels rerun his movies; and merchandisers exploit his image on everything 
from T-shirts to lamps. On the other hand, the reasons for his fame have 
become lost in the trappings of celebrity, especially for younger generations 
born after his death on August 16, 1977.
For the original fans, who have remained loyal for over 50 years, Elvis earned 
his reputation as the King of Rock ’n’ Roll; for others, discovering why he 
deserved his fame and a place in American cultural history may be a 
revelation.
In this chapter, I introduce you to Elvis Presley through the high points of his 
life and career, including his post-death popularity. This chapter sets up an 
extensive exploration of Elvis Presley — the cultural icon — that details the 
events of his life, explains the significance of his music, and contemplates his 
meaning to American pop culture.
Identifying a Cultural Icon
Almost everyone knows that Elvis Presley was a famous singer, but many 
people don’t fully understand what he contributed to popular music to earn 
his widespread fame. Elvis combined different types of music to form a style 
called rockabilly, which became one of the key sounds in rock ’n’ roll. To form 
this musical style, he fused the country-western music of the South with the 
rhythm and blues of African Americans and the pop music that dominated 
the radio and recording industries.

10
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
 
The combination of musical genres and sounds into a new style of music 
was Elvis’s true gift and his contribution to popular culture. That this integra-
tion of musical styles took place just prior to the civil rights movement, prefig-
uring social integration, makes this moment in pop culture history seem 
momentous.
Elvis wasn’t the first to sing in a rock ’n’ roll style, so he can’t be credited 
with inventing it. But, his version of this new music became widely popu-
lar during the mid-1950s. He spread rock ’n’ roll music across the country, 
making it popular to a wide audience, especially teenagers. In that regard, 
he was a true innovator. (For more information on Elvis’s start in music, see 
Chapter 2).
Elvis also yielded a strong influence on youth culture. During the 1950s, teen-
agers had begun to think of themselves as being different from their parents’ 
generation. Because of the economic prosperity of the period, teens enjoyed 
a disposable income that they could spend on themselves instead of con-
tributing toward family survival. With that money they dressed themselves 
in fashions marketed to their age group, went to movies that featured stars 
of their generation, and listened to music that appealed to them. So it wasn’t 
a surprise when Presley’s rock ’n’ roll music, his hairstyle, and his fashion 
sense became a part of this new culture for teenagers. (For more information 
on the burgeoning youth culture, see Chapter 5.)
Later in his career, Presley changed his musical style and his personal look 
to keep up with the times and gain popularity among older audiences. He 
became a movie star during the 1960s and then returned to live musical 
performances during the 1970s. Because his career went through so many 
changes, he was popular with different types of people for different reasons. 
Even after his death, his popularity remains strong among a wide variety of 
people. This wide popularity, as well as his important role in American musi-
cal history, makes him a cultural icon.
Uncovering the Roots of Elvis’s Music
On January 8, 1935, in Tupelo, Mississippi, Elvis Aron Presley was born a half 
hour after his stillborn twin brother, Jesse Garon. Thus, the occasion was 
a mixed blessing to parents Vernon and Gladys Presley, who lived in a two-
room shotgun shack on the wrong side of the tracks in Tupelo. A true son of 
the South, Elvis never ventured far from his roots, physically or musically. 
While a young boy in Tupelo, Elvis learned to play the guitar from relatives, 
and then he fell under the influence of country-western singer Mississippi 
Slim.

11
 Chapter 1: Introducing Elvis Presley
 
It wasn’t until his family moved to Memphis that Elvis’s real musical education 
began. The diversity of music on Memphis’s radio stations exposed Elvis to a 
variety of genres, which eventually influenced his music. Several radio sta-
tions played country music, and big band music was broadcast from the 
famed Peabody Hotel. Rhythm-and-blues artists could be heard on two differ-
ent radio stations: WDIA and WHBQ. WDIA was owned by two white men, but 
it was mostly staffed by black disc jockeys who played the locally produced 
records of hometown bluesmen. WHBQ played a variety of music, but it’s best 
remembered for disc jockey Dewey Phillips’s Red Hot and Blue program that 
showcased the recordings of black artists.
Memphis also developed into the center for white gospel music during the 
1950s, so the four-part harmonies of the gospel quartets who regularly visited 
the city became another influence on the teenage Elvis. He and his parents, 
and later he and his girlfriend, regularly attended the all-night gospel sings at 
Ellis Auditorium. In addition, the city’s Beale Street district was home to the 
clubs and joints where African American musicians played blues and rhythm 
and blues. Elvis became familiar with the music of the well-known local R&B 
artists, including B.B. King, Rufus Thomas, and Big Memphis Ma Rainey. All 
these Southern-based musical genres inspired Elvis’s early singing style, 
which turned out to be a true fusion of sounds. (For more information on 
Elvis’s early years, see Chapter 2.)
Recording for Sun Studio
 
Sam Phillips, owner of Sun Studio and a small Memphis-based record com-
pany also called Sun, recorded the music of blues and R&B musicians. He was 
quoted in local papers as saying, “If I could find a white man who could sing 
with the sound and feel of a black man, I could make a billion dollars.” Little 
did he know that Elvis would soon walk right through his doorway.
Elvis’s ability to integrate Southern musical genres into a blend of beat and 
rhythm was exactly what Phillips was looking for. However, it took some time 
before the two walked into the studio together and made history with Elvis’s 
first recording, “That’s All Right,” which was an old blues tune originally writ-
ten and recorded by Arthur “Big Boy” Crudup. Elvis’s interpretation of the 
song featured a relaxed vocal style, upbeat tempo, and a driving rhythm as 
well as these two elements that would make his sound famous:
 
✓ Syncopated lyrics using a hiccupping sound
 
✓ Reverberation for an echo effect

12
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
Elvis’s sound became the essence of rockabilly, though no one called it by 
that name at the time. A few days after his first recording, Elvis and the two 
musicians who backed him up — guitarist Scotty Moore and bass player Bill 
Black — recorded the bluegrass classic “Blue Moon of Kentucky” as the flip 
side to “That’s All Right,” giving Elvis his first single. (To read more about 
this single, check out Chapter 2.)
Sam Phillips took this first record to disc jockey Dewey Phillips (no relation 
to Sam) to play on his Red Hot and Blue radio program as well as to other 
deejays at other stations. By the end of the month, “That’s All Right” was 
shooting up the local charts, and Elvis made his first major public appear-
ance at the Overton Park Shell.
Gaining a fan base
From the summer of 1954 to the end of 1955, Elvis and his band, who called 
themselves the Hillbilly Cat and the Blue Moon Boys, enjoyed success as 
a Southern-based country-western act. Even though their music sounded 
decidedly different from typical country music, their status as white Southern 
singers classified them and their music as “country.” They cut four more 
singles for Sun Studio and toured across the South on the same bill as such 
well-known country acts as Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters, Hank 
Snow, Faron Young, and Ferlin Husky.
Elvis’s singing style wasn’t the only unique feature of his high-powered act. 
As he crisscrossed the South, his performing style evolved to become a 
unique, highly energetic part of an Elvis Presley performance. Dressed in 
outrageously colorful clothes — such as those worn by R&B artists down on 
Beale Street — Elvis moved throughout his entire act, bouncing on the balls 
of his feet, shaking his legs, and swiveling his hips. In addition, bass player 
Bill Black, something of a comedian, danced and rolled around on the floor 
with his huge bass fiddle. The trio’s frenzied performances were considered 
by some venues to be too wild, and other country performers hated to follow 
their act, but their weekly appearances on the Louisiana Hayride radio pro-
gram brought them wide exposure across the South and a loud, raucous, and 
youthful fan base.
 
In The Nashville Sound: Bright Lights and Country Music by Paul Hemphill, coun-
try singer Bob Luman recalls seeing Elvis when Luman was still a teenager in 
Kilgore, Texas: “This cat came out in red pants and a green coat and a pink 
shirt and socks, and he had this sneer on his face and he stood behind the 
mike for five minutes, I’ll bet, before he made a move. Then he hit his guitar a 
lick, and he broke two strings. Hell, I’d been playing for ten years, and I hadn’t 
broken a total of two strings. So there he was, these two strings dangling, and 
he hadn’t done anything except break guitar strings yet, and these high school 
girls were screaming and fainting and running up to the stage, and then he 
started to move his hips real slow like he had a thing for his guitar . . . .”

13
 Chapter 1: Introducing Elvis Presley
The antics of the fans, especially the girls, drew the attention of country 
promoter Colonel Tom Parker (also known as simply “the Colonel”), who 
believed the strange-looking kid with the big moves could be a national suc-
cess. By the end of 1955, Parker had succeeded in becoming Elvis’s manager, 
and with that the stage was set for Presley’s introduction to Middle America. 
(For more information on this era of Elvis’s career, see Chapter 3.)
Gyrating Across America
Colonel Parker negotiated a deal with the nationally based company RCA 
Victor to sign Elvis to a contract. The strategy at RCA involved exposing 
Elvis to mainstream audiences by promoting him in the nationally based pop 
market as well as the regionally based country and R&B markets. On January 
8, 1956, Elvis recorded his first songs for RCA, including “Heartbreak Hotel.” 
An instant success, the song climbed to number one on the pop and country 
charts and number three on the R&B chart. (For more information on Elvis’s 
contract with RCA and his first recordings for the company, see Chapter 4.)
 
Parker’s goal from the beginning was to gain the broadest audience possible 
for his one and only client. In addition to promoting Elvis’s records in the pop 
market to court the teen audience nationwide, he wanted to use television to 
broaden his “boy’s” appeal. Little did he realize that he was about to set off 
one of pop culture’s most famous controversies.
Two weeks after Elvis’s first RCA recording session, he appeared for the first 
time on television as a guest on Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey’s weekly variety 
series Stage Show. Compared to the more conventional acts on the show — 
such as pop singers, dancers, and comedians who dressed, performed, and 
acted like the singers, dancers, and comedians on other variety shows — 
Elvis looked strange, alien, even dangerous. If you tuned in to Stage Show and 
saw Elvis performing, the following might have shocked you as it did many in 
the television audience:
 
✓ His ducktail haircut, which was long and slicked back
 
✓ His shiny Beale Street suit, which featured wide-legged trousers that 
shook when he moved
 
✓ Eye makeup on his eyelids and under his lashes that must have startled 
even show business veterans who had seen it all
 
✓ His high-energy performance in which he shook, shimmied, and swiv-
eled, causing screams and squeals from the studio audience
During the next eight weeks, he appeared five more times on the program 
with ever-increasing ratings (though Stage Show never beat its competition 
on NBC, The Perry Como Show).

Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
The Colonel continued to book Elvis on the most popular variety shows, 
including the much-beloved Milton Berle Show. Elvis and his band first 
appeared on the Milton Berle Show in April. When he returned for a second 
appearance in June, he performed “Hound Dog” for the first time on televi-
sion — and in a particularly provocative manner, sensually thrust his hips 
toward the microphone. This single appearance ignited a nationwide back-
lash concerning his performing style. In fact, the performance prompted 
parents, religious groups, TV reviewers and columnists, and even the PTA 
(Parent Teacher Association) to condemn Elvis by declaring him indecent 
and associating his music with juvenile delinquency. The criticism against 
Elvis became part of the overall condemnation of the new youth-oriented 
music known as rock ’n’ roll.
After the Milton Berle Show, Colonel Parker booked Elvis on The Steve Allen 
Show. The high ratings from Allen’s program prompted Ed Sullivan to offer 
the unprecedented fee of $50,000 for Elvis to make three appearances on The 
Ed Sullivan Show. Elvis’s final appearance on Sullivan’s show in January 1957 
features the now legendary moments when the CBS censors demanded that 
“Elvis the Pelvis,” the singer’s new nickname in the press, be filmed only from 
the waist up while singing. More than live concerts or recordings, Elvis’s TV 
appearances fueled the controversy surrounding his hip-swiveling perform-
ing style.
 
The controversy surrounding Elvis’s performing style became symbolic of 
generational conflict, reflecting the rise of the new youth culture (see the ear-
lier section “Identifying a Cultural Icon” for more details on this new culture). 
However, other social circumstances also added to the conflict over Elvis and 
his music, including a prejudice against Southern culture and tastes and a 
racist attitude toward the music of African Americans. (For more information 
on the controversy generated by Elvis, see Chapter 5.)
Changing Elvis’s Notorious Image
Colonel Parker didn’t realize that courting teenage audiences around the 
country could generate so much controversy and bad publicity (see the pre-
ceding section for more on the uproar over Elvis the Pelvis). The notoriety 
certainly garnered television ratings, but it did little to broaden Elvis’s appeal 
to a mainstream audience. So throughout the rest of the 1950s, Parker and 
others worked to cool the controversy and broaden Elvis’s appeal.
Ever mindful of the value of old-fashioned promotion, which the Colonel 
called “exploitation,” the wily ex-carny generated a lot of publicity designed 
to counter Elvis’s image as a notorious rock ’n’ roller. Specifically, he

 Chapter 1: Introducing Elvis Presley
 
✓ Released photos of Elvis participating in charities
 
✓ Encouraged interviews in which Elvis talked about his love for his 
parents
 
✓ Negotiated a movie contract with producer Hal Wallis
However, nothing generated acceptance by the mainstream audience like 
Elvis’s service in the army. In the following sections, I look more closely at 
Elvis’s first Hollywood movies and his service in the army, which did more 
than anything else to change his image.
Shooting his first films
Negotiating a movie contract for Elvis served Parker’s long-term goal of 
reaching as broad an audience as possible. As a movie star, Elvis could 
attract regular moviegoers, including those outside the teen demographic, in 
addition to popular music fans. Producer Hal Wallis was an expert at recog-
nizing star power and constructing screen images for his actors. His handling 
of Elvis’s film career, including developing his film projects and fine-tuning 
his characters, led to a softening of Elvis’s controversial image.
 
Wallis placed Elvis under personal contract, but the Colonel negotiated for a 
nonexclusive contract, so Presley was free to make films for other producers 
and studios.
Elvis made four movies between 1956 and 1958: Love Me Tender, Loving You, 
Jailhouse Rock, and King Creole. The first, a Civil War–era western, featured 
Elvis as the youngest son of a family of homesteaders. The other three films 
starred Elvis in dramatic stories about young singers with new sounds who 
are misunderstood by the press and public.
Clearly echoing Elvis’s own career and life story, these films helped reshape 
the singer’s image in the eyes of the public, softening the criticism aimed 
against him and presenting him as just another show business success story. 
Wallis produced Loving You and King Creole, while Pandro S. Berman pro-
duced Jailhouse Rock. (For a detailed account of Elvis’s pre-army movies, flip 
to Chapter 6.)
Serving in the army
Elvis was drafted in late 1957 at the age of 22, but he managed to postpone 
his service in the army until March 1958 because of his contractual obliga-
tions to finish King Creole. When Elvis finally reported to his draft board, 
Colonel Parker made sure the press was on hand to document every step. 

16
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
Parker repeated to the press time and again how Elvis could have joined spe-
cial services in the army or the navy so he could serve his time by perform-
ing on bases around the world. However, Parker made it quite clear that Elvis 
opted to join the regular army and do his duty to serve his country — just 
like every other young man his age. Elvis spent the bulk of his two years serv-
ing in a tank division in Germany.
Instead of killing his career, serving in the army expanded it by attracting the 
attention of the mainstream audience, which is important to remaining at 
the forefront of show business. When Elvis was mustered out of the army in 
March 1960, the Colonel and others who helped manage Presley’s career took 
advantage of his time away from the public eye to recast his image, maturing 
it to appeal to older audiences while retaining his original fan base. (For more 
information on the impact of Elvis’s army service, see Chapter 5.)
 
While Elvis was in the army, two events in his personal life occurred that 
made a permanent impact on his life. In August 1958, near the beginning of his 
tour of duty, Elvis’s mother, Gladys, died unexpectedly. With her death, he 
lost his biggest supporter. Then in early 1960, near the end of his tour of duty, 
Elvis met 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu, whose stepfather was also a soldier 
in the service. The two began a relationship that would continue in the 1960s 
when Priscilla moved to Memphis at Elvis’s suggestion, eventually leading to 
marriage in 1967.
Becoming a Leading Man in Hollywood
While Elvis was in the service, critics speculated that the two years away 
from the public eye would seriously damage his career. They proclaimed 
that his position at the forefront of rock ’n’ roll would likely be lost. To some 
extent, they were right. Elvis didn’t return to the forefront of rock music 
when he was discharged from the army in 1960. However, that absence was 
deliberate. The Colonel wanted to shift Elvis away from rock ’n’ roll, which 
had endured more notoriety between 1958 and 1960.
Instead, when Elvis returned home, he gradually pursued a more mellow 
pop-influenced style of music and adopted a more conventional look. The 
Colonel took advantage of the good publicity over Elvis’s tour of duty to 
promote a new, more mature Elvis Presley. And, he and Elvis turned their 
attention almost exclusively to the movies as the medium to showcase this 
new Presley to a mainstream audience. In focusing on movie stardom, Elvis 
no longer needed high-profile backup musicians, so the Blue Moon Boys as a 
group were out of the picture. The group actually had stopped being called 
the Blue Moon Boys after Elvis signed with RCA in order to keep the focus 
on Elvis, though the trio continued to tour. During the 1960s, Scotty Moore 
and D.J. Fontana occasionally worked in the studio with Elvis as sessions 
musicians.

 Chapter 1: Introducing Elvis Presley
 
The Colonel’s goal was for Elvis to achieve widespread popularity as a movie 
star and therefore greater financial success. Elvis, on the other hand, yearned 
for a career as a serious actor. The Colonel attained his goal, but Elvis didn’t.
Starting out as an actor
A few weeks after his discharge from the army, an eager Elvis returned to 
Hollywood to begin shooting G.I. Blues, a story about a singer who’s serving 
in the army in Germany. Producer Hal Wallis borrowed details from Presley’s 
life to flesh out the script just as he had done in the pre-army movies (see the 
earlier section “Shooting his first films” for details). However, unlike Elvis’s 
earlier movies, G.I. Blues is a musical comedy, not a musical drama. Aimed at 
a family audience, the film presents the new, more mature Elvis Presley.
G.I. Blues was enormously successful; it ranked 14th in box office sales for 
1960. The soundtrack album reached number one, remaining on the charts 
longer than any other Presley album. Sadly, Elvis didn’t share the fans’ enthu-
siasm for G.I. Blues. He felt the movie had too many musical numbers, and he 
believed that some of them made little sense in context of the plot. He also 
was concerned that the quality of many of the songs fell short of the music 
from his earlier films.
The western Flaming Star, released in December 1960, gave Elvis the 
chance to prove himself as a serious actor. In this tense western drama, 
Elvis held his own with veteran actors John McIntire and Dolores Del Rio. 
Unfortunately, the film wasn’t the box office success it was expected to be.
The movies Elvis didn’t make
During the years Elvis was in Hollywood, he was 
offered opportunities to star in films that were 
not in the Presley formula — at least according 
to Colonel Parker. Stories about these opportu-
nities have been exaggerated over the years by 
highly critical writers and biographers in order 
discredit the films that he did make. But, there’s 
no doubt that the Colonel turned down some 
interesting proposals.
For example, in 1956, Parker turned down an 
offer for Elvis to appear as one of the rock ’n’ roll 
acts in director Frank Tashlin’s spoof of 1950s 
musical crazes, The Girl Can’t Help It, star-
ring Jayne Mansfield. Apparently, the Colonel 
didn’t want Elvis to share the screen with other 
notable rock ’n’ roll acts, such as Gene Vincent. 
In the 1970s, Barbra Streisand wanted Elvis to 
appear in her remake of A Star Is Born, but the 
Colonel refused for reasons unknown.

18
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
Wild in the Country, a contemporary drama, followed Flaming Star. No songs 
were included in the original script for Wild in the Country, but after the disap-
pointing showing of Flaming Star, Colonel Parker and some studio executives 
asked that several musical numbers be shot for the film. Six were shot, but 
only four made the final cut. Wild in the Country didn’t lose money at the box 
office, but it didn’t make much either. Both Elvis and costar Tuesday Weld 
were voted the Damp Raincoat Award for Most Disappointing Performers of 
1961 by Teen magazine. While this award would hardly ruin anyone’s career, 
it showed the Colonel exactly what kind of movie Elvis’s fans didn’t want to 
see. (See Part II for more information on Elvis’s movies.)
Finishing as a movie star
After the disappointing dramas, Elvis returned to musical comedies with Blue 
Hawaii, which was his second most financially successful movie. The movie, 
directed by Norman Taurog, featured a huge cast of colorful characters who 
could handle comedy. In response to his fans’ cries for more songs, Blue 
Hawaii also contains 14 musical numbers, including the title song and one of 
Elvis’s biggest hits “Can’t Help Falling in Love.” The songs represent a range 
of types and styles, from pop-rock (“Rock-a-Hula Baby”) to novelty tunes (“Ito 
Eats”) to ballads (“Can’t Help Falling in Love”).
Released during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays in 1961, the film 
quickly became a box-office hit. The soundtrack album was the fastest-selling 
album that year. Unfortunately, the success of Blue Hawaii restricted Elvis to 
acting in musical comedy vehicles, because the Colonel, Hal Wallis, and other 
members of his management team used the box-office figures to convince 
him that this was the only kind of movie his fans wanted to see him in. This 
dashed Elvis’s dreams of becoming a serious actor.
After Blue Hawaii, Presley made 23 more movies, most following the pattern 
established in this breezy musical comedy. Later, Elvis would bitterly refer 
to these formulaic films as the Presley Travelogues. Despite his distaste for 
them, most of Elvis’s films were popular successes and highly profitable. At 
one point in the mid-1960s, Elvis became the highest-paid actor in Hollywood. 
Even though he failed to become a serious actor, Elvis Presley was an 
extremely successful movie star.
 
By 1964, Colonel Parker had persuaded Elvis to focus almost entirely on the 
movie soundtracks. Many of the songs written for these musical comedies 
were as formulaic as the films themselves, but some solid pop tunes also were 
included. However, because the songs on the soundtrack albums weren’t well 
organized and because the albums weren’t always marketed wisely, many of 
the good tunes were lost among the mediocre ones. (See Chapter 7 for more 
information on the movie music Elvis produced.)

 Chapter 1: Introducing Elvis Presley
Evaluating a Hollywood career
Many biographies, rock music histories, and other accounts of Elvis’s career 
analyze his movie years with the benefit of hindsight. The standard interpre-
tation of this period is that Elvis’s musical comedy vehicles were disappoint-
ments in comparison to his earlier film work and that both his acting and 
singing talents were squandered by greedy agents and managers, particularly 
Colonel Parker. Considering the profundity and influence of Elvis’s music from 
the 1950s, this negative opinion of his 1960s pop-oriented sound and movie-
star persona almost makes sense. Yet other factors need to be considered.
For example, most of Elvis’s movies and albums from the 1960s were finan-
cially successful no matter how hastily they were produced. Financial profit 
is a measure of success in pop culture, particularly in Hollywood, so Elvis 
and the Colonel had no reason to question — let alone alter — their game 
plan for Elvis’s career. Also, if Elvis had continued singing rock ’n’ roll, he 
may not have survived the changes to the music scene in the 1960s. After all, 
many pioneering rock ’n’ rollers didn’t. Finally, if Elvis had continued to make 
more serious films such as Flaming Star and Wild in the Country, he wouldn’t 
have been guaranteed success with those either.
Despite the financial success of his films, Elvis became increasingly disap-
pointed and depressed about his Hollywood career. And, there’s no escaping 
the fact that both his movies and the accompanying soundtracks declined 
sharply during the mid- to late-1960s. (See Chapter 8 for more on the decline 
of Elvis’s film career.)
Personally, Elvis lived an isolated, distorted existence far removed from the 
real world. The Colonel protected Elvis from the press and public throughout 
the 1960s, so interviews and articles about his life as a movie star were lim-
ited to those orchestrated or controlled by the Colonel himself.
Capitalizing on a Turning Point
The year 1968 marked a turning point for Elvis professionally and personally. 
The change began in January when RCA released the single of “Guitar Man.” 
The song didn’t chart very high, but it was a non-soundtrack recording that 
signaled Elvis’s willingness and perhaps eagerness to cut material that wasn’t 
related to the movies he was still contractually bound to make.
Colonel Parker then negotiated a deal with NBC for a television Christmas 
special. The special turned out to be the spark that reignited Elvis’s talent 
and creativity. A combination of his old music and new material, the special 
reminded Elvis that he had a musical gift and challenged him to use it to 
regain his stature in the music industry. Proud of the results, Elvis knew he 

20
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
wanted to change the direction of his career. Riding the momentum of the 
special, Elvis recorded the acclaimed album From Elvis in Memphis, which 
pointed him in a new direction musically.
Elvis’s personal life also hit a high point in 1968. Married in the spring of 
1967, Elvis and Priscilla became the proud parents of a baby girl, Lisa Marie, 
in February 1968. In this section, I talk about the important events that turned 
Elvis’s career around, which serendipitously occurred during the happiest 
time of his personal life.
Making a comeback with the 
’68 Comeback Special
In early 1968, the Colonel announced plans for an Elvis Presley television 
special that would air on NBC in December. It was Elvis’s first TV appearance 
in eight years. Parker planned for his boy to sing several Christmas carols 
in front of a Yuletide setting, but producer Steve Binder encouraged Elvis to 
participate in a daring variety program instead.
The special, originally titled Elvis but later referred to as Elvis — the ’68 
Comeback Special or simply the ’68 Comeback Special, consisted of a series 
of polished production numbers designed to illustrate the roots of Elvis’s 
music. These production numbers alternated with segments featuring Elvis 
singing live before a studio audience with two of his original backup musi-
cians, Scotty Moore and D.J. Fontana. For the live segments, Elvis appeared 
in a black leather jacket and pants — a costume that recalled an earlier era 
without resorting to nostalgia.
 
The special revealed a side to Elvis that hadn’t been seen since 1961 — the 
part of him that was the rock ’n’ roll innovator. It reminded audiences of his 
music and its importance to the development of popular American music. 
And, the live segments showcased one of his true talents, which was his abil-
ity to excite an audience as a dynamic live performer. (For a detailed account 
of the ’68 Comeback Special, see Chapter 11.)
Reinventing the music
The ’68 Comeback Special aired on December 3, 1968, earning excellent rat-
ings and favorable reviews. Invigorated by the challenge of doing something 
different from the movie musicals, he decided to cut a new album that was in 
no way related to a movie soundtrack. Elvis opted to record in Memphis for 
the first time since he had left Sun Records.

21
 Chapter 1: Introducing Elvis Presley
In January and February 1969, he spent several days recording with producer 
Chips Moman at the American Sound Studio, resulting in several chart-
topping singles and one of his most critically acclaimed albums, From Elvis 
in Memphis. One of the songs from the American Sound Studio sessions was 
“Suspicious Minds,” his first number-one single in seven years and the last 
one of his career.
The material recorded at the American Sound Studio prefigured his musical 
style of the 1970s, which was a large-scale sound that revealed the influences 
of modern country, pop music, and contemporary rock. (See Chapter 11 for 
more information on Elvis’s sessions at American Sound Studio.)
Taking time for a personal life
Around the time that Elvis was reinventing himself, he married Priscilla 
Beaulieu, who had been more or less living at the Presley home in Memphis 
since the early 1960s. A wizard at manipulating the media, the Colonel kept 
her presence hidden from the press. Elvis and Priscilla married on May 1, 
1967, and nine months later to the day, their only child, Lisa Marie, was born. 
(See Chapter 7 for more information on Priscilla Beaulieu Presley.)
To get the best account of Elvis’s marriage and family life, read Priscilla 
Presley’s autobiography Elvis and Me. Autobiographies by former members 
of the Memphis Mafia also offer opinions of Elvis’s personal life, but their 
views of the woman who was competition for their time with Elvis are often 
jaundiced or self-serving.
Returning to Live Performances
In the summer of 1969, the opportunity arose for Elvis to play at the newly 
opened International Hotel in Las Vegas. Elvis’s appearance at the infa-
mous hotel marked a new phase of his career that had begun with the ’68 
Comeback Special and the album From Elvis in Memphis. At this point, he was 
still in the process of reinventing himself, and so he decided to return to con-
cert performances with new material and a new image.
 
Just as he had deliberately changed his image in 1960 to expand his career 
and launch it in a new direction, he again stood ready in 1969 to reevaluate his 
goals and alter his musical style to return to live performances. Part of Elvis’s 
long-term success stemmed from his ability to reinvent himself by moving his 
career in new directions.

22
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
Attending an Elvis concert: 
Teddy bears and underwear
Elvis opened at the International Hotel on July 31, 1969, and the engagement 
was so successful that the Colonel inked a deal for Elvis to perform there 
twice a year for a month each time. The following year, Elvis began to tour 
when he wasn’t playing Vegas. During this time, Elvis established a pattern 
that he followed for the rest of life: He hit the road two to three times a year 
but played Vegas for a month in winter and a month in summer. (For more 
information on Elvis’s International Hotel engagement, see Chapter 12.)
 
As Elvis fine-tuned his act on the road, patterns and rituals were established 
that defined what a Presley concert was like. In the 1970s, beginning with the 
show at the International Hotel, Elvis sometimes mocked his sexually provoca-
tive 1950s image by comically imitating the pelvic thrusts, the snarling lip, 
and the other moves associated with Elvis the Pelvis (see Chapter 5). He also 
established new interactions with his fans; rather than egging them on with 
sexually provocative gyrations, he began “romancing” them with ballads such 
as “Love Me Tender.” During this song, fans came down to the front of the 
stage, and Elvis kissed them, touched their hands, or accepted flowers, teddy 
bears, and other trinkets. Sometimes, he threw them back.
Throwing objects back and forth between the stage and the audience became 
a common practice with Elvis and his fans. After wiping his brow with a 
towel or scarf, he would throw it into the audience. This exchange became 
such a standard part of the show that band member Charlie Hodge would 
continuously drape towels around Elvis’s neck so he could toss them to the 
audience.
Another interesting ritual between Elvis and his fans in the audience involved 
throwing underwear onstage, especially in Las Vegas. Women would throw 
their panties onstage, which Elvis sometimes picked up and made jokes 
about. (For more information on Elvis’s 1970s concerts, see Chapter 13.)
Dressing a star: The jumpsuits
During the International Hotel engagement, Elvis wore an open-necked black 
mohair ensemble with a red scarf. Bill Belew, who had designed Elvis’s black 
leather outfit for the ’68 Comeback Special, put together the mohair suit. After 
that Elvis always asked Belew to design costumes for his live performances. 
In fact, it was Belew who fabricated the white bejeweled jumpsuit, suppos-
edly based on a suggestion by Priscilla Presley.

23
 Chapter 1: Introducing Elvis Presley
As the years passed, the jumpsuit costume grew more and more elaborate 
and was often accompanied by waist-length and even knee-length capes. 
Because Elvis had new jumpsuits designed for each tour, fans can date photos 
or footage of Elvis performing onstage in the 1970s based on the jumpsuit he’s 
wearing. The jumpsuits are identified by their colorful names, such as the 
American Eagle, the Black Conquistador, the Peacock, and the Tiffany. You 
can see Elvis performing in one of his signature jumpsuits in Figure 1-1.
More than anything, the jumpsuit has become associated with Elvis during 
this phase of his career. Many who know little about Elvis’s career and music 
can recognize him from this iconic outfit of his Vegas years. (For more infor-
mation on Elvis’s jumpsuits, check out Chapter 13.)

Appreciating the World’s Greatest 
Entertainer: “Vegas Elvis”
The extravagant costumes and complex rituals of Elvis’s period in Vegas fit 
the scale of the 1970s Presley concert. In Vegas and on the road, Elvis was 
joined onstage by a gospel quartet, a female backup trio called the Sweet 
Inspirations, a rock band, and a 35-piece orchestra.
Elvis’s repertoire of songs varied throughout the 1970s, but his style of music 
didn’t change. The style wasn’t exactly rock ’n’ roll, but it wasn’t country 
music or rhythm and blues either. Elvis’s style took something from all these 
genres, and yet it still transcended musical categories to form a sound unique 
to the singer. Dramatic, potent, and emotional, Elvis’s sound — embodied 
in such songs as “Suspicious Minds” and “Burning Love” — seemed aurally 
symbolic of Colonel Parker’s favorite billing for Elvis, “the World’s Greatest 
Entertainer.”

Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll

Elvis enjoyed a number of career highlights during the 1970s, including some 
record-making accomplishments. (For more information on the high points of 
the 1970s, see Chapter 14.) Among the most memorable are:
 
✓ In June 1972, a handsome, fit Elvis Presley played four sold-out shows 
at Madison Square Garden. He became the first performer to sell out all 
of his shows in that venue in advance. Among the attendees were John 
Lennon, David Bowie, Bob Dylan, and George Harrison.
 
✓ MGM produced and released two financially successful documentaries 
that captured Elvis’s live performances, Elvis — That’s the Way It Is 
(1970) and Elvis on Tour (1972). The latter won a Golden Globe for the 
Best Documentary of 1972.
 
✓ In January 1973, Elvis starred in the television special Elvis: Aloha from 
Hawaii, which was broadcast live via the Intelsat IV telecommunications 
satellite to countries in the Far East. Two days later, a taped replay was 
broadcast in Europe, and in April, the special was aired in America. 
Some estimates claim that 1.5 billion people eventually watched this 
performance.
Taking a toll: A personal and 
professional decline
After his burst of creativity in the early 1970s, a demanding schedule and 
an unhealthy lifestyle took its toll on Elvis. Endless touring and the exhaus-
tion that accompanied it eventually wore away the enthusiasm and inspi-
ration he had felt after the ’68 Comeback Special. Repetition and routine 
began to define his act as Elvis lost his desire to update or change material. 
Eventually, the concerts became standardized.
Elvis’s albums also began to decline in quality as he grew restless with 
recording. He cut fewer new songs every year; in fact, some years he 
recorded no new material at all. Yet RCA still managed about three releases 
per year by relying on live albums of various concerts and by repackaging 
songs from previously issued albums with what little new material there was. 
Some of these albums and singles charted well, especially on the country 
charts, but Elvis lost interest in making music and lacked focus and enthu-
siasm when the Colonel or producer Felton Jarvis managed to get him to 
record.
Isolated from the real world and secluded at Graceland when not on tour, 
Elvis lived a strange life — sleeping all day and staying up all night. Inclined 
toward excess, including overeating, overspending, and prescription drug 
abuse, Elvis became increasingly out of shape, unhealthy, and erratic.

25
 Chapter 1: Introducing Elvis Presley
Elvis and Priscilla divorced in 1973, which friends and associates claim accel-
erated the star’s drug use, health problems, and bizarre behavior. After 1973, 
frequent hospitalizations occurred as his health declined. (To read more on 
Elvis’s personal and professional decline, refer to Chapter 15.)
The End of the Road for the King
On June 26, 1977, Elvis Presley gave his final performance at Market Square 
Arena in Indianapolis, Indiana. Less than two months later, he was dead 
at age 42. His girlfriend, Ginger Alden, found his body slumped over in the 
bathroom at Graceland on August 16, 1977. After paramedics failed to revive 
him, he was taken to Baptist Memorial Hospital where further attempts to 
revive him failed. He was pronounced dead by his physician, Dr. George 
Nichopoulos, who listed the official cause of death as cardiac arrhythmia.
Within an hour of Elvis’s death, fans began to gather in front of Graceland. 
Mourners arrived in Memphis from all the over the world to pay their 
respects and be with other fans. At the funeral, the speakers included tel-
evangelist Rex Humbard, comedian Jackie Kahane, who had often opened 
for Elvis, and a local Memphis minister. Several prominent gospel perform-
ers, including Jake Hess, sang some of Elvis’s favorite gospel hymns. After 
the service, a motorcade of all-white automobiles carried the body to Forest 
Hill Cemetery. A short time later, a threat to steal Elvis’s remains was inter-
cepted, prompting his father to have the body moved to Meditation Garden 
behind Graceland. His mother’s remains were moved there as well. (For more 
information on Elvis’s death, see Chapter 16.)
Elvis Presley’s death generated much media attention, some of it positive 
and much of it negative; it also resulted in extended air play of his records on 
the radio and prompted rampant sales of his records. And, that was just the 
beginning.
Tracing Elvis Presley’s Continued 
Popularity
Elvis’s 23 years in show business constituted an extraordinary career. He pur-
sued and conquered different avenues; his achievements were financially lucra-
tive, which is always a barometer of success in the entertainment industry; and 
he made a major impact on the direction of popular music during the 1950s.

26
After his death, Elvis’s “career” continued to be extraordinary. (See Part IV 
for a thorough account of the events, celebrations, accomplishments, and 
rumors surrounding the popularity of Elvis since his death.) His fan base has 
remained loyal to this day, which isn’t surprising, but Elvis’s enormous popu-
larity and recognition go well beyond his original fan base. He also has:
 
✓ Generated new fans
 
✓ Become the focus of a multimillion-dollar business headed by Elvis 
Presley Enterprises
 
✓ Continued to be referenced often in the media, whether in news stories, 
in jokes, or in a measure of the magnitude of his celebrity
 
✓ Often been named the top-earning celebrity of the year — despite being 
dead for more than 30 years
 
Simply stated, the reason that Elvis retains such an enormous level of popular-
ity is that he appeals to different groups of people for different reasons. His 
career was so diverse, his music so innovative, and the post-death phenom-
enon so strange that everyone finds something interesting or entertaining 
about the different phases of his life or career. Consider the following groups 
of Elvis fans:
 
✓ Rock ’n’ roll enthusiasts prefer Elvis the Pelvis, who brought rock ’n’ 
roll to the masses and represented rebellion against mainstream values 
and tastes.
 
✓ Music historians and scholars appreciate the cultural significance of his 
integration of regional influences to achieve a wholly new sound.
 
✓ Country-western fans embrace his music as an important influence on 
contemporary country styles.
 
✓ Original fans remember Vegas Elvis because of his charisma in concert.
 
✓ Family audiences like the lighthearted wholesomeness of his movies, 
which they can watch with their children on DVD.
 
✓ Pop culture lovers find fun in the way Elvis has become an icon of 
kitsch.
With Elvis Presley, there truly is something for everyone. Behind this simple 
statement lies a complex set of circumstances accounting for the phenom-
enon, however. Part sociohistorical context, part fan devotion, part merchan-
dising, and part cultural influence, these circumstances combine to make 
Elvis Presley the American idol. Continue reading this book for a look at the 
unabridged story, a complete portrait of the man who remains The King of 
Rock ’n’ Roll, and a credible interpretation for the reasons why.

C
onsidering his first public performance at the Overton Park Shell, much 
of Elvis Presley’s youth and adolescence have been honed into a tidy 
version of the American Dream through the frequent retelling of his life story 
in biographies, coffee-table books, music histories, and other writings. The 
events of his early life are artfully wedged into a mythic narrative about a 
poor boy with talent who eventually grows up to become the most famous 
singer in America.
I cast that cliché aside to show that Elvis’s early life contains important 
threads that offer insight into his music, his career path, and his personal 
choices. His love of family, his Southern identity, and his poverty-stricken 
childhood, along with the influence of Memphis as a musical center, are all 
keys to understanding who Elvis Presley was, how his sound developed, and 
why his career took the path that it did.
In this chapter, I examine Elvis’s early life, with a special emphasis on those 
key threads. I also detail the making of Elvis’s first record at Sun Studio, 
which featured the songs “That’s All Right” and “Blue Moon of Kentucky.” As 
I detail the story of Elvis’s first record, I analyze the cultural significance of 
the fusion of musical influences in his revolutionary sound.

Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
Growing Up in Tupelo
In the early morning hours of January 8, 1935, Elvis Aron Presley was born in 
rural Tupelo, Mississippi, a small town nestled among the corn and cotton 
fields in the northern part of the state.
The birth of Elvis was both a happy and sad moment for his parents, Vernon 
and Gladys Presley. Roughly a half hour before he was born, his twin brother, 
Jessie Garon, had arrived into the world. However, Jessie was stillborn and 
that cast a pall over the occasion. Jessie’s death had a lasting impact on the 
Presley family. Elvis was at times haunted by the loss of his twin, who was 
his only sibling, and Gladys kept her remaining son close to her. Elvis and his 
mother would maintain an unusually tight bond throughout her short life.
Other tragedies and hardships would befall the close-knit Presleys over the 
years, keeping the trio in poverty and at times dependent on their extended 
family. Eventually, the Presleys moved to Memphis, looking for a chance 
at a better life. (See the upcoming section “Walking in Memphis: Elvis the 
Teenager” for details about the move and their life in the big city.)
 
Despite the poverty and hardships, Elvis spoke fondly of life in Tupelo. After 
all, his interest in music had been sparked in the small town when he was a 
little boy singing gospel music in church and listening to his first musical influ-
ence, Mississippi Slim, on his hometown radio station.
The following sections take a close look at Elvis’s parents, his life in Tupelo, 
and the reasons behind the family’s relocation to Memphis. My snapshot of 
Elvis’s childhood reveals some of the reasons Tupelo held good memories 
for him.
Introducing Elvis’s parents
The daughter of a sharecropper, Gladys Love Smith was born in the farmland 
of Pontotoc County near Tupelo in 1912. Gladys shared what little the family 
had with seven siblings and was forced to go to work at a young age because 
her father had died and her mother was sick with tuberculosis.
Born in Fulton, Mississippi, in 1916, Vernon Elvis Presley grew up in the poor-
est part of Tupelo. Vernon didn’t get along with his father, J.D. Presley, who 
kicked him out of the house to go work when he was 15. Vernon and J.D. 
tolerated each other, but J.D. was a hard-drinking hothead who wasn’t cut 
out to be a husband and father. Eventually, he left his wife and children and 
moved north.

29
 Chapter 2: Walking a Mile in His Shoes: Examining Elvis’s Early Years
Gladys, a tall, dark-haired beauty, met handsome Vernon Presley in 1933 
when she moved to East Tupelo to work at the local garment factory. He 
was 17, and she was 21; the smitten couple married two months after they 
met and brought Elvis into the world two years later. (Figure 2-1 shows the 
Presley family during the Tupelo years.) In those early days, Gladys was 
an outgoing woman who loved to socialize, and the pair regularly attended 
the East Tupelo Assembly of God Church. With family and friends from 
the church, they sang gospel music, often harmonizing together on one of 
their favorites “The Old Rugged Cross.” Gladys and Vernon were part of the 
church choir, and Elvis followed in their footsteps when he was old enough.
The Presleys lived in a two-room house on Old Saltillo Road, which was in the 
poorest section of this small, rural town. The tiny home was a type of dwell-
ing known as a “shotgun shack,” because it was so small and simply designed 
that someone could fire a shotgun into the front door and the bullet would fly 
out the back without hitting anything. Vernon Presley worked as a laborer in 
Tupelo, which meant he did anything from driving delivery trucks to share-
cropping. Gladys worked at the garment factory until about the time that 
Elvis was born. After he was born, she picked cotton with her son perched on 
top of her cotton sack.
Like most rural Southerners during the Depression, Vernon and Gladys had 
quit school as soon as they were old enough to work or help with their fami-
lies. They took whatever jobs they could find, which wasn’t unusual for resi-
dents of poor rural communities at that time. In some biographies of Elvis, 
Vernon is painted as something of a n’er-do-well, because he didn’t hold 
down one job, and he moved his family around a lot. But, these biographers 
lack a full understanding of what it was like to be poor in the South, and their 
depictions of Vernon seem more judgmental than accurate.
Aron versus Aaron
Elvis Presley’s middle name causes an undue 
amount of confusion for fans and historians 
alike. The traditional spelling of the name is 
“Aaron,” but Dr. William Hunt, the old country 
doctor who attended the Presley births wrote 
“Aron” on the birth certificate. No one can say 
for sure whether Dr. Hunt accidentally mis-
spelled Elvis’s middle name, or whether Mrs. 
Presley had chosen “Aron” to match the middle 
name of twin Jessie Garon. Elvis was named 
after a family friend, Aaron Kennedy, but that 
doesn’t mean that Gladys couldn’t take creative 
license with the name. When Presley was an 
adult, he thought seriously about legally chang-
ing the spelling to Aaron, partly because that’s 
the biblical spelling of the name. In the process, 
however, he learned that state records already 
listed it as Aaron. When Elvis died, his father 
chose “Aaron” for the tombstone, because he 
knew his son would want it that way.

30
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
 
Elvis and his family may have been poor, but he had a secure childhood in 
terms of love and support. He was close not only to his mother and father but 
also to his large extended family of aunts and uncles who helped each other in 
troubled times. His mother was devoted to his care and safety, watching him 
carefully to keep him out of trouble and harm’s way. Stories abound about 
how she walked him to school every day and wasn’t comfortable allowing him 
out of her sight. These tales were exaggerated after Elvis’s death, but family 
members and friends have since come forward to offer more accurate por-
traits of her as a devoted mother, not an obsessive one. As a child, Elvis told 
his mother that he would always take care of her and his father. True to his 
word, Elvis took care of his parents financially as soon as he became success-
ful. He also gave money to extended family members or hired them to work for 
him after he became famous.

Prison. 
Examining the family’s greatest misfortune
Times were difficult for the small family early on, but they became worse in 
November 1937, when Vernon and two other men were arrested and charged 
with check forgery. The trio had forged a check to Vernon’s landlord, Orville 
Bean. The forged amount wasn’t very much, but the three men were given 
a harsh three-year sentence at Parchman Prison, a prison farm where the 
inmates worked the land in chain gangs while serving out their time.
Vernon’s prison sentence proved extremely difficult on his tiny family. 
Gladys was unable to keep up the payments on their house by herself, and so 
she lost possession of it. She and her son stayed with various relatives until 
Vernon was released from prison early in February 1939.
After his release, Vernon returned to working odd jobs. Sometimes he landed 
jobs in other parts of the state, but the family always had a difficult time making 

31
 Chapter 2: Walking a Mile in His Shoes: Examining Elvis’s Early Years
enough money. As he moved from one job to another, Vernon moved his 
family around Tupelo from one rented home to another. The Presleys spoke 
of these hard times only in very general terms, but Vernon once recalled that 
after he came home from prison, Elvis didn’t want to let him out of his sight.
Considering Elvis’s earliest musical 
influences and experiences
Elvis expressed an interest in music before he was old enough to go to 
school, belting out gospel tunes at church. Later, when he was in grade 
school, he learned to play the guitar from his uncles and neighbors, particu-
larly his Uncle Vester Presley. Vester knew how to play more than just gospel 
music, because he occasionally sang in Tupelo’s honky-tonks, which were 
small, rough-and-tumble bars that hired local talent to attract customers.
Elvis also showed his talent at the local fair. Each year on Children’s Day, the 
Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show sponsored an amateur talent con-
test, which was broadcast over Tupelo radio station WELO. When Elvis was 
around 10 years old, the boy entered the talent contest at the county fair at 
the insistence of a teacher who had heard him sing in class. Elvis’s experience 
in this talent show has been exaggerated over the years. Some insist that he 
won second place, but various Tupelo residents have come forward to dispute 
this claim. Whatever the case, the boy was quite young when he sang — with 
no musical accompaniment — the ballad “Old Shep” for the talent show. In 
fact, he was so small that he had to stand on a chair to reach the microphone.
Not long after his fair experience, Elvis became a fan of local country-western 
singer Mississippi Slim, who hosted a couple of radio programs on WELO. 
Slim’s real name was Carvel Lee Ausborn, and he was the brother of one of 
Elvis’s friends, James Ausborn. Through James, Elvis had easy access to the 
entertainer, and he soaked up Slim’s tales of being on the road and singing 
professionally.
Slim taught the eager Elvis more chords on the guitar and may have provided 
him with an opportunity to play before an audience on the WELO Jamboree, 
which was an amateur hour hosted by Slim every Saturday afternoon. Like 
the fair story, however, accounts of Elvis’s participation on the Jamboree are 
contradictory and can’t be trusted. Historians are sure that he visited the 
radio station regularly, however.
 
Mississippi Slim sang pure country music, complete with the twanging guitar 
and the catch in his voice. So the first major influence on Elvis Presley wasn’t 
the rhythm-and-blues artists of Memphis. Instead, his first influence was from 
a bona fide “hillbilly singer.”

Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
Walking in Memphis: Elvis the Teenager
During Elvis’s day, Memphis, which is nicknamed the River City, was a cross-
roads of influences from up and down the Mississippi River as well as from 
the mountains in the eastern part of the state. Blacks, whites, rural folk, city 
residents, and even Yankees mingled in Memphis. The city’s teeming popula-
tion of different people and cultures was reflected in the diversity of music 
that thrived there. For more than a century, the city was a virtual breeding 
ground for new musical trends and sounds.
From the moment the Presleys set foot in the city, Elvis was exposed to the 
many sounds and styles that later served as influences on his own music. In 
a way, he received a “musical education” by embracing the sounds of the city 
while growing up in Memphis. This informal education proved to be more 
helpful and influential than his official, sanctioned education at L.C. Humes 
High School.
In this section, I discuss the family’s move to the big city, provide an over-
view of the types of music that inspired the teenage Elvis, and offer a snap-
shot of his high-school years.
 
Roughly one of every four inductees into the Rock ’n’ Roll Hall of Fame hails 
from Memphis or its surrounding areas.
Making the move
By the fall of 1948, Tupelo had become a dead end for the Presleys. Work 
for Vernon was scarce, so the family decided to move to the city — to 
Memphis — for better job opportunities. Their move was much like those 
of rural families who left their farms and small towns for the big cities 
after World War II.
 
In a rare candid moment during an interview, Elvis recalled about the family’s 
move to Memphis, “We were broke, man, broke. Dad packed all our belongings 
in boxes and put them in the trunk and on top of a 1939 Plymouth [actually a 
1937 Plymouth]. We just headed for Memphis. Things had to be better.”
The family’s situation did improve in Memphis, especially after Vernon 
landed a job at a paint factory. In the fall of 1950, the Presleys moved into a 
housing project called the Lauderdale Courts, and Elvis attended L.C. Humes 
High School. While the Courts were designed for families living at the poverty 
level, they weren’t slums. A thriving, bustling atmosphere defined the Courts, 
and most of the residents worked hard to improve their lives. At one point, 
when Vernon and Gladys were both working, the family’s income exceeded 
the amount allowed by the Memphis Housing Authority for public housing 

33
 Chapter 2: Walking a Mile in His Shoes: Examining Elvis’s Early Years
recipients. The family had to move, but they chose to remain in the same 
neighborhood as the Lauderdale Courts.
After a time, Elvis’s grandmother, Minnie Mae Presley, came from Tupelo to 
live with her son Vernon, and she remained a fixture in the Presley house-
hold for the rest of Elvis’s life. She cooked for the family when Gladys was 
lucky enough to find work, she stepped in to take care of Vernon and Elvis 
when Gladys died in 1958, and she provided a link to extended family mem-
bers. Sadly, Minnie Mae, whom Elvis affectionately called Dodger, outlived 
both her son and grandson.
Getting through high school
Elvis attended high school and endured adolescence like any other working-
class teenager. Though he occasionally got good grades in some subjects, 
Elvis was largely a “C” student at L.C. Humes High School, also called Humes 
High. Elvis graduated on June 3, 1953, which was an accomplishment that 
many in his extended family hadn’t achieved. In this section, I offer a brief 
look at these tender years.
Hanging with his buddies from the Courts
Elvis hung out with several boys who also lived in Lauderdale Courts 
and attended Humes High, including Buzzy Forbess, Farley Guy, and Paul 
Dougher. The group liked to go to the movies together at the Suzore #2 and 
Rialto Theatres, which were close to the Courts. Sometimes they also rode 
bikes, played sports, or walked around Memphis. To earn money, the four 
mowed lawns around the neighborhood with old push mowers. When the 
boys became old enough, they got part-time jobs. Elvis worked as an usher at 
the Loew’s State Theater for a while.
Sometimes the teens from the Courts held record parties, and witnesses 
from the era recall Elvis bringing his guitar to these informal get-togethers. 
He would generally sing one or two songs, so the people in the neighborhood 
were aware that he could sing.
Some of Elvis’s later friends and bodyguards, including George Klein and Red 
West, attended Humes at the same time, but they didn’t know each other 
very well during high school.
Adopting a style
In high school, Elvis didn’t really stand out and wasn’t part of the popular 
crowd. He tried out for the football team, but he didn’t last much past a few 
weeks of practice. However, by his junior year, he had begun to grow his 
hair long and dress like the R&B musicians from Beale Street. Elvis never 
had much to say about high school, but students who remember him recall 

34
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
that he dressed flamboyantly and wore his hair long. Despite being shy, he 
entered the Minstrel Show (the Humes High talent show) and sang one song, 
accompanying himself on the guitar.
Absorbing a medley of musical influences
As he made his way through high school in Memphis, Elvis discovered the 
different genres of music that were part of the city’s music scene. He col-
lected records of diverse artists, listened to a variety of radio stations, and 
attended live performances to soak up the different performing styles and 
sounds. Though Elvis may have had the most eclectic interests of any teen-
ager in Memphis, the indigenous sounds and styles of the South — gospel, 
R&B, and country — made the deepest impression. In this section, I explain 
the types of music Elvis was exposed to in Memphis and the different outlets 
that provided it.
Collecting records
While he was soaking up the musical styles of his adopted hometown, Elvis 
began collecting records. His tastes were eclectic, revealing a curiosity and 
passion for all types of music. This curiosity was impressive for someone 
so young. Like the diversity of music that surrounded him in Memphis, his 
eclectic record collection could be considered an influence on the way he 
combined styles and genres in his own sound. Most of Elvis’s record collec-
tion is still housed at Graceland.
 
Looking through Elvis’s record collection offers an understanding of how 
music offered him an outlet to express his personal tastes, which were dif-
ferent from teens his age or from other members of his family. How many 
teenagers of the time would have owned a copy of “Malaguena,” which was 
flamenco dance music arranged by Russian musician Andre Kostelanetz, 
famous as the “father” of easy-listening music. Most of Elvis’s family lacked his 
interest in pop music, as found in his single of “Witchcraft” by the Spiders, or 
in blues records such as “Shake a Hand” by Faye Adams. Elvis’s copy of the 
Prisonaires’ “Just Walking in the Rain,” which was produced by Sam Phillips, 
suggests that he knew of Phillips’s reputation for recording local talent.
Listening to the radio in Memphis
The River City boasted a multitude of innovative radio stations whose disc 
jockeys were not only great judges of local talent but also daring in their play-
lists. Unlike radio today, stations during the 1950s reflected and influenced 
the tastes and popular culture of the regions they serviced. In a city like 
Memphis, which was rich with the musical sounds of many groups and cul-
tures, the radio stations disseminated different types of music to all peoples. 
Disc jockeys, who were experts on the latest music, were free to “spin the 
platters” of artists they believed in. Thus, some radio deejays yielded a lot of 
influence on public tastes. The Memphis radio stations made up one of the 

35
 Chapter 2: Walking a Mile in His Shoes: Examining Elvis’s Early Years
key outlets for Elvis to experience and learn to appreciate different genres of 
music.
Country western
At home, the Presleys listened to country western, and Elvis was known to 
occasionally attend broadcasts of live entertainment at country-western sta-
tion WMPS. Country music underwent many changes during the 1940s, and 
those changes had permanently altered its sound and styles. For example, 
Ernest Tubb had introduced the electric guitar to the Grand Ole Opry, coun-
try music’s most famous radio program and a favorite in the Presley house-
hold. Also, western swing music had combined boogie-woogie with country 
to form a contemporary sound that appealed to young listeners like Elvis.
Elvis enjoyed country music his entire life, and it played a major role in the 
development of his music not only in the 1950s but also in the 1970s. (See the 
later section “Cutting ‘That’s All Right’” and Chapter 11 for specific informa-
tion on the influence of country on his music.)
Gospel
In the 1950s, Memphis became the headquarters of harmony-style gospel 
music. The top white gospel groups of the era performed at the “All-Night 
Gospel Singings” at Ellis Auditorium. These sings, which were held about 
once a month, featured one gospel group after another and lasted into the 
wee hours of the morning.
Elvis attended these sings whenever possible. The shows featured a variety 
of gospel styles, but it was the tight harmonies of the gospel quartets that 
attracted Elvis the most. He was personally acquainted with the Blackwood 
Brothers, a gospel quartet consisting of four brothers who attended the 
same Assembly of God church as the Presleys. His favorite group was the 
Statesmen, whose lead singer, Jake Hess, combined aspects of black gospel 
music with the harmony style that Elvis grew up with. The Statesmen, headed 
by the colorful Hovie Lister, dressed flamboyantly for a gospel quartet, their 
singing style was highly emotional, and their performing style was exciting 
and energetic. They weren’t afraid to move with the music. All these stylistic 
trademarks proved influential on Elvis.
Elvis performed gospel music for the rest of his life. He enjoyed singing it 
with family and friends to relax and pass the time. He also recorded several 
award-winning gospel albums. After he signed with RCA in 1956, he insisted 
that a gospel group sing backup for him on stage and on recordings. Gospel 
kept him connected to his Southern roots, which in turn provided him with 
comfort in times of tension and strife.
Blues and R&B
Besides “River City,” Memphis’s other nickname was “Home of the Blues.” 
And Beale Street was indeed home to the seedy clubs and rough joints where 
African American blues musicians ruled the roost. The joints on Beale Street 

36
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
also gave birth to rhythm and blues, or R&B, which combined the heavy beat 
of blues with a faster rhythm and more sophisticated melodies.
Given Elvis’s young age, it’s unlikely that he spent a lot of time in the clubs 
on Beale Street — partly because his church-going mother wouldn’t have 
allowed it and also because Memphis was part of the South, which was still 
socially segregated. But, he listened to blues and R&B at record shops, such 
as Poplar Tunes and Charlie’s, and he added many R&B singles to his record 
collection. When Elvis began recording, R&B proved to be a prominent influ-
ence on his rockabilly sound. (See “Cutting ‘That’s All Right’” later in this 
chapter for more information.) Also, like many R&B musicians of the times, 
Elvis bought his flashy shirts and slacks at Lansky Brothers clothing store 
on Beale Street. (Chapter 3 provides more information on Elvis’s clothing 
preferences.)
 
Poplar Tunes, founded by Joe Cuoghi, epitomized the 1950s record shop. 
Located near Lauderdale Courts, the shop served as a hangout for teenagers, 
who could try out new records in the store before buying them. Poplar Tunes 
sold the records of local artists, including Elvis when he began recording. The 
shop, which looks much the same as it did in the early 1950s, is still open and 
still sells Elvis’s records.
Understanding Southern musical genres
 
Even though Elvis became a fan of singers as varied as pop crooner Dean 
Martin and operatic singer Mario Lanza, the indigenous musical genres of the 
South had the strongest influence on his early sound. The South wasn’t merely 
Elvis’s geographical birthplace. Elvis’s Southern heritage defined him person-
ally and musically. The types of music that inspired him — rhythm and blues, 
country western, blues, and gospel — are steeped in the unique history and 
cultures specific to the South.
For example, African Americans and rural white Southerners coexisted in a 
racially segregated world with a tense atmosphere, but their cultures shared 
common key values and beliefs, such as strong family ties, religions that 
focused on earthly suffering and heavenly rewards, and the fervent belief 
in sin and redemption. These themes, images, and values were naturally 
reflected in the music and arts of both African Americans and rural white 
Southerners. Given this common thematic ground, it isn’t surprising that the 
various musical styles and genres were influenced by each other. Elvis’s com-
bination of Southern genres and styles in his music extended the influence 
into integration.
The regionally based musical styles and genres spoke to the peoples of the 
South in a personal way not characteristic of mainstream audiences and 
pop music. In other words, a blues lament about working the fields all day at 

37
 Chapter 2: Walking a Mile in His Shoes: Examining Elvis’s Early Years
Parchman Prison farm (“Parchman Farm Blues” by Bukka White) reflects the 
beaten-down spirit of the victims of the South’s harsh penal system. Often, 
inmates worked from sunup till sundown no matter the weather conditions, 
and African Americans were subject to the most brutal treatment. African 
American listeners had firsthand knowledge and experience of their brutal 
treatment at the hands of the Southern “justice” system and could relate to 
the song.
Similarly, a country song glorifying trains (“Train Whistle Blues” by Jimmie 
Rodgers) reveals a reverence for a mode of transportation that provided 
escape from the poverty, the backbreaking work, and the limited opportuni-
ties for poor Southerners. Those rural white Southerners who had escaped 
the country for the city knew the necessity of leaving such an environment 
(like the Presleys did), but they still ached for the comfort of “back home.”
Elvis strongly identified with the themes, styles, and lyrics of Southern-
based music, which had meaning to him that few outside the South ever 
understood.
Making Music and History at Sun Studio
If Elvis had plans for a singing career when he graduated, he didn’t confide 
in anyone at that time. But, a few months after graduation, he cut an acetate 
disc at the Memphis Recording Service, where he was noticed by Marion 
Keisker, assistant to local record producer and owner of Sun Records and 
Studio Sam Phillips. A few months later, Elvis returned to cut another disc 
and caught the attention of Phillips himself, who jotted down his name and 
information. A few months later, in July 1954, Phillips called him to come 
to Sun Studio and record a song. And, thus began the most groundbreaking 
singing career of the 20th century.
In this section, I chronicle the steps leading up to Elvis’s first recording at 
Sun Studio and the pioneering nature of that first single. I also list the other 
singles Elvis recorded for Sun and detail the start of his career.
Taking that first step: Elvis, Marion, 
and the Memphis Recording Service
Shortly after he graduated from L.C. Humes High School in 1953, Elvis, who 
was working in the small-engine repair department at M.B. Parker Co., walked 
into the Memphis Recording Service and told the woman behind the desk, 
Marion Keisker, that he wanted to cut an acetate disc.

38
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
 
In the days before tape recorders were readily available to the mainstream 
public, recording services existed so the general public could record anything 
on an acetate disc for a small fee. As a matter of fact, the motto of the 
Memphis Recording Service was “We record anything, anywhere, anytime,” 
and owner Sam Phillips meant it. Anyone could cut an acetate disc — people 
who wanted to record greetings for loved ones in the service, those who 
wanted to get down their personal histories for posterity, or folks who wanted 
to hear what their singing voices sounded like.
The day that Elvis dropped by, he cut the song “My Happiness,” a 1948 ballad 
that had been made famous by the Ink Spots, on a disc for a fee of $4. Elvis 
recorded another Ink Spots song, “That’s When Your Heartaches Begin,” for 
the other side of the disc. Elvis accompanied himself on his childhood guitar.
 
The decision to record his voice at the Memphis Recording Service that hot 
summer day represented Elvis’s first step toward a career, though he didn’t 
realize it himself at the time, and it’s unlikely that he was following any kind of 
master plan.
Sam Phillips, the owner of both the Memphis Recording Service and Sun 
Records (see the upcoming section for details on Phillips), was always look-
ing for new talent. The Memphis newspapers had written about Phillips and 
the local artists he had recorded several times. More than likely, Elvis was 
hoping to catch Sam’s attention when he walked into the building to record 
his disc. The Memphis Recording Service, which was open to anyone, and 
Sun Records, which was for professional musicians, shared the same studio 
and office space.
Unfortunately, Phillips wasn’t there at the time — Ms. Keisker was running 
the service alone. She noticed Elvis’s long, slicked-back hair and sideburns 
and asked him what kind of music he sang and whom he sounded like. He 
answered, “I don’t sound like nobody,” which made her curious. So she taped 
the young singer on the studio’s new master tape recorder while he made his 
disc.
Phillips had once told Keisker that R&B could become popular with the gen-
eral public if he could find a white performer who could sing with the sound 
and feel of a black man. Sam made the same statement to several parties 
around town. Because Elvis chose two songs made famous by the Ink Spots 
(a popular African American vocal group), Keisker thought that Phillips 
might be interested in the polite young man. But, when the producer finally 
listened to the two recordings, he wasn’t impressed.
Presley returned to the Memphis Recording Service in January 1954 to record 
two more songs: the ballad “Casual Love Affair” and the country-western 
song “I’ll Never Stand in Your Way.” This time Phillips worked the controls. 
The producer took down the young singer’s name and address, but he didn’t 
offer Elvis much encouragement.

 Chapter 2: Walking a Mile in His Shoes: Examining Elvis’s Early Years
 
After Elvis became famous, his first encounters with the Memphis Recording 
Service were molded into a story that was told and retold until it became a 
legend that simply isn’t accurate. When Elvis showed up at the Memphis 
Recording Service for the second time, he was working for Crown Electric 
delivering supplies. In the legend, however, Elvis was a truck driver when he 
happened to stroll into the recording service for the first time to cut a record 
as a gift for his mother’s birthday. But, Elvis was working for a machinist when 
he made his first disc in the summer of 1953. And, even though he was deliver-
ing supplies with a truck when he cut the second disc, he wasn’t driving an 
18-wheel tractor-trailer, which is what most people think of when they hear 
the term “truck driver.” His mother’s birthday was in April, so that part of 
legend is also untrue.
Meeting Sam Phillips
Sam Phillips owned and operated both the Memphis Recording Service and 
Sun Studio. He also owned Sun Records, an independent record label that 
had been recording R&B artists for a couple of years. Phillips enjoyed a 
national reputation for discovering talented R&B singers. He paid the musi-
cians, financed the sessions, and recorded the artists himself in his little 
studio on Union Avenue. He generally leased the master recordings to vari-
ous small record companies across the country, who then released the songs 
on their own labels.
Phillips had been exposed to gospel and blues music growing up in Alabama, 
and he, like Elvis, experienced the hard life and poverty common to rural 
Southerners. When he began Sun Records in 1952, he recorded the blues music 
of African American artists who wanted to cut singles but couldn’t find studios 
willing to record them. He also recorded country groups, including the Starlite 
Wranglers. As a record producer, he drew on his life experiences to shape a 
purely Southern sound that combined R&B, blues, and country-western music 
with a hardscrabble philosophy born of bad times. The music that he culti-
vated — that Dixie-fried sound called rockabilly — emanated from Sun Studio 
throughout the 1950s and became a core sound of rock ’n’ roll.
 
Sam Phillips said this of his desire to record the music of poor Southerners: 
“I just knew this [music] was culture, and it was so embedded in these people 
because of hardship . . . Generation after generation, these people have been 
overlooked — black and white!”
Finally, in June 1954, Phillips called Elvis. The producer thought the kid might 
be the singer to handle a ballad titled “Without You” that had the potential to 
be a good record.

40
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
Presley rushed down to Sun Studio and gave the song his best effort. 
However, Elvis couldn’t seem to capture whatever it was that Phillips wanted 
for the ballad, so the producer had him run through every tune that he knew. 
When nothing panned out, Phillips figured that Elvis needed practice and 
seasoning. Sam knew everyone in the music business in Memphis, so he 
contacted Scotty Moore, a guitar player with the Starlite Wranglers, and sug-
gested that he meet with Presley and a local bass player named Bill Black for 
some practice.
Cutting “That’s All Right”
In early July 1954, the unlikely trio of Elvis, Scotty Moore, and Bill Black 
decided they were ready to begin work in Sun’s tiny recording studio. One 
evening, after trying a few ballads unsuccessfully, the group finally hit 
on something while fooling around during a break. Presley started sing-
ing Arthur “Big Boy” Crudup’s old blues song “That’s All Right” with a fast 
rhythm and a casual style. Moore and Black quickly picked up their instru-
ments and jumped in. Phillips, who was excited by the trio’s fresh sound, 
asked them to start over and refine their playing a bit. Then he eagerly 
recorded what he thought was surely lightning in a bottle. A few nights later, 
they recorded their version of Bill Monroe’s country bluegrass hit “Blue 
Moon of Kentucky.” Refer to Figure 2-2 to see Phillips and the trio in the 
studio.
These two songs became the group’s first single release. That first record — 
with a blues tune on one side and a country classic on the other — clearly 
shows where Elvis’s music was coming from. In the following sections, I 
describe in detail the musical sound of Elvis’s first single and then explain its 
cultural significance.
 
The label on the single listed “Elvis Presley” beneath the song title and below 
that in smaller letters the names “Scotty and Bill.” From the billing, it was clear 
that Elvis was the star attraction, but the contributions of the other two musi-
cians were noted.
Rocking the rhythm
Elvis’s versions of “That’s All Right” and “Blue Moon of Kentucky” sounded 
nothing like the originals. His approach was more easygoing, giving his inter-
pretations an air of spontaneity. He replaced the hard vocal delivery and 
slow rhythm of Crudup’s version of “That’s All Right” with a relaxed vocal 
style and fast pace. Likewise for “Blue Moon of Kentucky,” the tempo was 
sped up, and two elements were added that would make Presley famous: syn-
copation and reverberation. Elvis’s syncopation of certain lyrics gave them 
a hiccuplike effect as he sang, and the reverberation engineered by Phillips 
during recording created a slight echo.

Presley’s style became known as rockabilly, which referred to the mix of coun-
try music, commonly called “hillbilly,” with R&B that has been relaxed and 
sped up, or “rocked.”
Achieving musical integration
Elvis’s early style as finessed by Phillips was truly an innovative fusion of 
African American and rural white Southern genres. The blues or R&B part of 
Elvis’s music was infused with a driving rhythm that derived from country-
western music or mountain music, and the country part was given a hard 
beat that came from the blues. The combination grew out of Presley’s eclec-
tic personal tastes and his understanding of these regionally based sounds.
In combining country western, the music of the rural white South, with blues 
and R&B, the music of African Americans, Elvis and Phillips achieved a musi-
cal integration the same year that Brown v. the Board of Education (1954) 
forced the integration of schools in the South. This case would go on to 
spearhead the civil rights movement and the drive toward social integration. 
Elvis’s first record is an example of cultural integration, which prefigured the 
social integration that became a big part of our sociopolitical history in the 
1950s and early 1960s. And, it suggests the importance of popular culture in 
paralleling, reflecting, or influencing social change. It also suggests that in 
any study of an era’s history or society, an assessment of popular culture is 
vital for fleshing out additional insights and nuances of the period.
 
Phillips and the group were excited about the single they cut and the innova-
tive sound they produced, but they also were aware of the racial restrictions 
of their society. In an era when the city’s white blue-collar workers were 
coerced into joining all-white unions, and Phillips received threats and put-
downs for fostering the music of black artists, the four knew their efforts 
would be considered provocative.

42
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
Releasing additional Sun Studio 
recordings
After Elvis’s first record was such a local success (see the next section for 
more info on that success), Phillips began cutting additional single releases 
with his latest discovery in the fall of 1954. Like Elvis’s first record, the other 
four Sun singles featured an R&B-flavored tune on one side and a country or 
pop song on the flip side, though Elvis rendered both tunes in his rockabilly 
style. As with “That’s All Right” and “Blue Moon of Kentucky,” Moore and 
Black backed Elvis on his other recordings.
Music historians with a purist view claim these recordings to be the high 
point of Elvis Presley’s career, because they best reflect the raw rockabilly 
sound that proved so innovative and influential in the history of rock ’n’ 
roll. Even though not everyone agrees with this assessment, the records are 
significant enough to be given their due. So in this section, I outline each of 
Elvis’s follow-up Sun Studio recordings.
“Good Rockin’ Tonight” / “I Don’t Care if the Sun Don’t Shine”
The second single disc that Elvis recorded with Phillips was released in 
September 1954. The disc included the songs “Good Rockin’ Tonight” and “I 
Don’t Care if the Sun Don’t Shine,” and it sold 4,000 copies in the Memphis 
area in two-and-a-half weeks.
Though written and released by Roy Brown in 1947, “Good Rockin’ Tonight” 
became better known the following year when R&B artist Wynonie Harris 
recorded the definitive version. Harris had speeded up the tempo compared 
to Brown’s version, and Elvis speeded up Harris’s interpretation even further. 
Scotty Moore’s driving guitar rhythms emphasized the speed, and Bill Black’s 
frenzied bass slapping drove home the beat to underscore the two distinctive 
features of rockabilly.
 
The song’s first line, “Have you heard the news?” was originally derived from 
a phrase used during World War II to denote good news about the war: “Good 
evening, America, there’s good news tonight.” But, it has since been consid-
ered a metaphor to represent the shock of the news that surrounded Elvis’s 
innovative sound.
Even though it had originally been written as a pop song for the animated 
Disney feature Cinderella, Elvis gave the flip side to his second single, “I Don’t 
Care if the Sun Don’t Shine,” a rockabilly treatment as well. Still, it wasn’t 
enough to overcome the bland pop lyrics, which lack the hipness of “Good 
Rockin’ Tonight.” Small wonder “Rockin’” has completely overshadowed it. 
The tune was more suited to the styles of pop singers Patti Page and Dean 
Martin, who recorded it in the early 1950s.

43
 Chapter 2: Walking a Mile in His Shoes: Examining Elvis’s Early Years
“Milkcow Blues Boogie” / “You’re a Heartbreaker”
The next single that Elvis recorded was released around the first week 
of January in 1955 and included “Milkcow Blues Boogie” and “You’re a 
Heartbreaker.” The single sold well locally, and both sides of the record 
received a lot of airplay on local radio. “You’re a Heartbreaker” edges 
“Milkcow” out in terms of significance, because it became the first Elvis song 
for which sheet music was issued.
“Milkcow Blues Boogie” offers a good example of the way blues and coun-
try music exchanged influences. Blues singer Kokomo Arnold wrote and 
recorded the song in 1934, and then legendary bluesman Robert Johnson 
cut it in the mid-1930s. Texas swing singer Bob Wills, who may have heard 
Johnson’s version because the bluesman recorded for a while in Dallas, 
released it a few years later in the country market. Elvis’s version starts out 
slow like Johnson’s interpretation, but then he rocks the rhythm and turns 
it into a rockabilly hit. As you can see, the historical lineage of the song tells 
the story here — from blues (Arnold and Johnson) to country (Wills) to rock-
abilly or rock ’n’ roll (Elvis).
On the flip side of the disc is “You’re a Heartbreaker,” which could be clas-
sified as a sort-of retro-sounding country song. It has been dubbed the most 
country of all the songs Elvis recorded for Sun. Sam Phillips purchased the 
tune from amateur songwriter Jack Sallee, and it became the first Elvis song 
for which Phillips owned the publishing rights. This brought in more money 
for Phillips, because as publisher he got an additional cut for each disc sold. 
And, if another singer recorded it, he got a cut of that version, too.
“I’m Left, You’re Right, She’s Gone”/ “Baby Let’s Play House”
In April 1955, Elvis released a disc with the songs “I’m Left, You’re Right, 
She’s Gone” and “Baby Let’s Play House.”
The single’s B side, “Baby Let’s Play House,” did so well that it became the 
first Elvis single to appear on a national chart. It climbed to number ten on 
the Billboard list of top-selling country songs. Many music historians cite this 
song as the epitome of the Sun Studio sound, partly because of the edgy syn-
copation of the word “Baby” at the beginning of the song and also because 
of the pure rockabilly rhythm. The provocative lyrics in which the singer 
declares to a girl that he “wants to play house” reveal the sexual overtones of 
the tune.
 
Elvis personalized the song by changing “religion” to “pink Cadillac” in the 
line, “You may get religion but don’t you be nobody’s fool.” Elvis loved big 
cars, especially Cadillacs and Lincolns, and he was fond of having them 
custom colored. About a year after this song was released, Elvis bought his 
mother a brand-new pink Cadillac.

44
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
Bluesman Arthur Gunter wrote and originally recorded “Baby Let’s Play 
House” in 1954, borrowing the title from the Eddy Arnold country song “I 
Want to Play House with You.” Again, the origin of the tune reveals the back-
and-forth influences between the different genres of Southern-based music. 
Elvis attacked this song with enthusiasm, humor, and a rush of adrenaline, 
making it his own.
Despite the witty title, “I’m Left, You’re Right, She’s Gone” features lyrics 
that are as banal as “Baby’s” are provocative. Songwriters Stanley Kesler and 
Bill Taylor wrote the tune the year before based on an old Campbell’s soup 
jingle. Country songs are notorious for using puns, twisting familiar phrases, 
and playing off common clichés, and this tune is a good example of that. The 
rockabilly treatment of this country song, as well as Elvis’s enthusiastic per-
formance, elevates the song above the content. But the song paled in com-
parison to “Baby Let’s Play House.” In fact, it didn’t even chart.
“Mystery Train”/ “I Forgot to Remember to Forget”
Elvis’s single of “Mystery Train” and “I Forgot to Remember to Forget” 
was released in August 1955 and was his last single disc for Sun Records. 
“Mystery Train reached number 11 on the Billboard Country Disc Jockey 
chart, and “I Forgot to Remember to Forget” did even better, reaching 
number one on the Billboard jukebox chart and number one on its list of best-
selling country songs.
“Mystery Train” has become one of Elvis’s most emblematic songs, because 
the phrase “mystery train” has been appropriated by writers in referring to 
his music or career. The song previously had been recorded by another Sun 
Studio artist, Little Junior Parker, in 1953. Parker’s version was inspired by 
the Carter Family’s “Worried Man Blues.” The song is a lament, but Elvis’s 
pared-down, fast-paced interpretation is more haunting than mournful. The 
shuffling rhythm, which is the result of Scotty Moore’s excellent guitar play-
ing, is reminiscent of a train’s locomotion.
 
According to Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards in an oft-repeated quote, 
“Everyone else wanted to be Elvis. After hearing [“Mystery Train”], I wanted to 
be Scotty Moore.”
The flip side of the disc, “I Forgot to Remember to Forget,” was more popular 
at the time of release. As a matter of fact, it remained on the country charts 
for 39 weeks, longer than any other Elvis single release on any Billboard 
chart. The song was written by Stanley Kesler and Charlie Feathers, with the 
latter singer-songwriter also under contract to Sun Records. One reason for 
the song’s popularity may have been because it was recorded by several Sun 
artists. It was adaptable to any singer’s style. In addition to Elvis, Johnny 
Cash released a version with piano accompaniment by Feathers in 1958. 
Jerry Lee Lewis cut it in 1961. Ironically, in retrospect, it has been forgotten, 
perhaps because of the elevation of “Mystery Train,” because of its symbolic 
value in describing Elvis’s life.

 Chapter 2: Walking a Mile in His Shoes: Examining Elvis’s Early Years
Making His Radio Debut with 
Deejay Dewey Phillips
Producer Sam Phillips knew he had something special in “That’s All Right.” 
So on July 7, 1954, he personally delivered a copy of the song to the hottest 
disc jockey in Memphis — Dewey Phillips (who was no relation to Sam). 
Dewey was an extremely colorful character, whose uninhibited personality 
was perfectly suited to his radio program in which he played the records of 
whatever singers he wanted to hear, including African American blues artists 
and R&B performers. Dewey did everything his own way. In fact, when he was 
reading a commercial over the airways, he often ad-libbed part of the copy, 
much to the chagrin of the sponsor, and usually concluded with, “Tell ‘em 
Phillips sent ya.”
Listeners knew Dewey was his own man, and they trusted his tastes and were 
influenced by his program. Phillips had known Dewey for several years, and 
they shared an interest in blues and R&B. For all those reasons, Dewey was 
the obvious choice to launch “That’s All Right.” (You can read more about 
Dewey in the nearby sidebar “Deejay Daddy-O-Dewey.”)
Because he trusted Phillips, Dewey decided to spin “That’s All Right” on his 
WHBQ program Red Hot and Blue. After listening to the record, he truly liked 
what he heard. When he introduced the single on his program the same night 
he received it, telephone requests poured in for the deejay to play it again. 
Dewey played the song over and over until he decided to put the unknown 
singer on his program that very night.
While his record was making its radio debut, Elvis was trying to relax at 
the movies. After Dewey phoned the Presley residence and asked for Elvis, 
Vernon and Gladys dashed to the Suzore #2 to retrieve him. They went up 
and down the aisles of the theater until they found him, and then the three 
raced to the station. Daddy-O-Dewey, as he called himself on the air, told 
the nervous young singer not to worry, because he would tell him when the 
on-air interview started. He asked Elvis several questions about his life and 
interests, trying to put him at ease. When Dewey thanked his guest for his 
time, Elvis asked whether he was going to be interviewed or not. The crafty 
deejay told him that he already had, because the mike had been open the 
entire time. According to Phillips, Elvis broke out into a panic sweat.
One of the questions that Dewey asked the novice singer was what high 
school he had attended, and Elvis replied, “Humes High.” Though a harmless 
question on the surface, it revealed to listeners that Elvis was white, because 
Memphis was a segregated city and Humes was a white school. Because Elvis 
had recorded a blues tune written and previously released by a black man 
(Arthur “Big Boy” Crudup), and because Dewey often played the music of 
African American musicians, audiences could have assumed the singer was 
black without the deejay’s polite revelation of Elvis’s race.

46
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
After the buzz created by the Red Hot and Blue program, Sam Phillips sent 
“That’s All Right” and “Blue Moon of Kentucky” to the factory to be pressed 
as both a 78 rpm single and a 45 rpm single. At this point, the phenomenal 
career of Elvis Presley was launched.
 
Thanks in part to Dewey Phillips’s enthusiasm for Elvis Presley, “That’s All 
Right” created a stir in Memphis, selling 6,300 copies in three weeks. The 
record climbed to number three on the local country-western charts, eventu-
ally selling 30,000 copies across the South.
Performing in Public for the First Time
On July 30, 1954, Presley made his first public appearance at the Overton 
Park Shell. Accompanied by guitar player Scotty Moore and bass player 
Bill Black, Elvis sang his two new hits “That’s All Right” and “Blue Moon of 
Kentucky.”
Deejay Daddy-O-Dewey
Born in the small town of Adamsville, 
Tennessee, Dewey Mills Phillips was just a 
small-town country boy until he came into his 
own on the airwaves of WHBQ in Memphis. 
Almost everything he did on his radio pro-
gram was completely off the cuff. Part of the 
appeal of his program, Red Hot and Blue, was 
the music, but entertainment also came from 
his spontaneity, hip slang, and outrageous 
antics. He often referred to himself as Daddy-
O-Dewey. Consideration of his career offers 
a window into the individualism that defined 
the 1950s deejays, who often had a significant 
impact on the music scene via their support of 
certain performers and genres of music.
Prior to landing his job as a radio deejay, 
Phillips tried to hold regular jobs, but the same 
characteristics that made him a star on the 
radio made him virtually unemployable in the 
regular world. For example, he was fired from 
the Taystee Bread Bakery because he talked 
the bakers into stopping production in order to 
make little bread people. And as an employee at 
Grant’s dime store, he got into trouble for talk-
ing like jive over the store’s intercom. However, 
he eventually talked his way onto the staff of 
WHBQ, which was broadcast from the Hotel 
Chisca. Phillips took control of Red Hot and 
Blue, and despite having no formal training in 
radio, made the program a local hit.
By the late 1950s, however, hard times befell 
Dewey Phillips. Top-40 programming had 
become the mainstay of popular radio, and real 
personalities like Phillips were shoved aside. 
In and out of work for the next dozen years, 
Phillips never regained the stature he enjoyed 
in the mid-1950s. In 1968, he died of pneumonia, 
and Elvis attended the service, never forgetting 
the first deejay to play one of his records.

47
 Chapter 2: Walking a Mile in His Shoes: Examining Elvis’s Early Years
 
Elvis was just one of several acts on the program at the Overton Park Shell 
that evening. The headliner was country yodeler Slim Whitman. Elvis was so 
new to the music scene that he was billed as “Ellis Presley” in ads for the 
event.
Like a tightly wound spring, the young singer moved all over the stage as 
he performed his two songs, partly because he had a case of stage fright. 
But stage fright aside, the young man was always full of nervous energy. 
Performing live gave him an outlet to release that pent-up energy. During the 
performance, he continually shook his leg while he sang, which caused some 
of the teenagers in the audience to scream. Backstage during a break, he 
asked Moore what the audience had been screaming at. Somewhat surprised 
at the audience reaction himself, Moore remarked that it was the way Elvis 
was shaking his leg.
 
Exactly where or from whom Elvis derived his kinetic performing style has 
been hotly debated in biographies and music histories. The truth is that, 
like his musical sound, his performing style was an integration of influences, 
including singers and black and white gospel performers. It’s a hybrid of vari-
ous influences and is something unique to Elvis as an entertainer. In fact, it’s 
something that differentiated him from later rockabilly singers. The following 
influences have been cited by various biographers as inspiring the performing 
style that forever branded “gyrating” a dirty word, but his live act is decep-
tively difficult to dissect, so I would caution drawing cause-and-effect 
conclusions:
 
✓ Lead singer Jake Hess of the colorfully dressed Statesmen was an 
expressive singer, while bass singer Jim Wetherington liked to wear 
wide-legged pants. When Wetherington shook his leg, his pants leg quiv-
ered. Elvis not only adopted an expressive singing style but he also had 
a fondness for wide-legged pants.
 
✓ Flamboyant Pentecostal preachers knew how to rile their congregations 
to emotional high points via their preachings. Elvis learned to drive his 
audiences to a sort of controlled hysteria.
 
✓ Blues musician Ukelele Ike, who played at the Gray Mule on Beale 
Street moved provocatively onstage as Elvis would do as his career 
progressed.
 
✓ Rhythm-and-blues singer Wynonie Harris also dressed colorfully.
Much later, Elvis’s onstage movements, twitches, and gyrations would 
become controversial, making the singer notorious as well as famous. (See 
Chapter 5 for more information on the controversy over his performing 
style.)

Chapter 3
Touring As the Hillbilly Cat 
and the Blue Moon Boys
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at life on the road with Elvis and his band
▶ Taking a closer look at Elvis’s clothing preferences
▶ Understanding the importance of touring
A
fter Elvis’s first public appearance at the Overton Park Shell in 1954 
(see Chapter 2 for more information on this performance), the inex-
perienced singer began performing at local Memphis clubs and venues with 
guitar player Scotty Moore and bass player Bill Black. After a few weeks, the 
bookings expanded to clubs and halls outside the city, including appearances 
at two of the most important venues in the South — The Grand Ole Opry and 
the Louisiana Hayride. The group was met with mixed results, but by 1955, 
Elvis and his band, who were dubbed the Hillbilly Cat and the Blue Moon 
Boys, began touring with established country performers.
For the next year and a half, Elvis and his band sharpened their skills and 
seasoned their act on the road, touring with some of the biggest names in 
country music. However their music didn’t sound like the other acts on the 
bill. During that time, Elvis honed his singing style; adopted his trademark 
look of flashy clothes, long sideburns, and long ducktail haircut for his act; 
and developed his performing style from a series of tics, spontaneous bursts 
of energy, and jumpy steps to a deliberate set of moves calculated to elicit 
screams and excitement from the audience.
Most importantly, Elvis gained a following that included country fans, R&B 
fans, and African Americans. Eventually, his largest following became a vocal 
fan base of teenagers and young adults who responded to his expressive 
singing and sensual performing style with an enthusiasm that seemed like 
hysteria. Interestingly, throughout 1954 and 1955, when he toured in the 
South and was labeled a country singer, he received little complaint about 
his frenetic onstage movements or his atypical clothing and hair styles. The 
biggest complaints came from other country singers who disliked following 
Elvis and his high-powered act. He and his group whipped the young girls 
into a frenzy, leaving the traditional country acts in the dust.

50
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
 
Elvis was heavily condemned for his music and performing style only after he 
became a nationally based recording artist in 1956 and his sound was called 
rock ’n’ roll.
In this chapter, I turn back the clock to take a look at Elvis in the beginning, 
when he was a fresh talent with a new sound touring the back roads and the 
country venues of the South. I discuss his appearances on the Grand Ole Opry 
and the Louisiana Hayride radio program and examine how touring impacted 
his career. Finally, I point out the differences between Elvis and the other 
country acts that he toured with as well as the unique response of his audi-
ences to his high-powered performances.
Introducing the Blue Moon Boys
Elvis and his band toured as the Hillbilly Cat and the Blue Moon Boys. The 
name was inspired by the trio’s first recording, “That’s All Right,” which was 
an old R&B tune by black musician Arthur “Big Boy” Crudup. At the time, 
local music aficionados and record buyers called R&B music “cat music,” and 
Elvis was a rural white Southerner, or a “hillbilly” singer. Just like his music, 
Elvis’s stage name integrated two styles of music. The name “Blue Moon 
Boys” was a nod to the flip side of the single disc “That’s All Right,” which 
was “Blue Moon of Kentucky.”
 
Producer Sam Phillips’s secretary, Marion Keisker, may have been the person 
who coined Elvis’s nickname, “the Hillbilly Cat” — at least according to a 1955 
Memphis Press-Scimitar article.
Fellow Blue Moon Boys, Moore and Black, had initially been tapped by 
Phillips in 1954 to help whip Elvis into shape musically for recording. Phillips 
knew Moore as a local guitarist who was trying to single-handedly push his 
country group, the Starlite Wranglers, up the ladder of success. And Black, 
who also was an occasional member of the Wranglers, lived two doors down 
from Moore, so it was convenient for them both to show Elvis the ropes. Elvis 
also knew Black’s younger brother, Johnny, because the family had lived in 
Lauderdale Courts at the same time as Elvis and his family.
 
According to Elvis biographer Peter Guralnik in Last Train to Memphis, Moore’s 
impression of Elvis upon their first meeting was a humorous one: “He was as 
green as a gourd,” Moore said. And here’s Black’s impression from the same 
meeting: “Well, he didn’t impress me much. Snotty-nosed kid coming in here 
with those wild clothes and everything.”
Moore, a respected guitar player around the Memphis music scene, gave 
Elvis’s sound the driving rhythm that was its strength. Black played doghouse 
bass, which was the large, upright instrument popular in musical combos 
before the electric bass guitar took hold. With his bass, Black was in charge of 
the beat, often slapping the instrument so hard and fast that it looked painful.

51
 Chapter 3: Touring As the Hillbilly Cat and the Blue Moon Boys
 
Though Elvis would get all the glory because of his vocals, the contributions 
of Moore and Black to the rockabilly sound can’t be underestimated.
After the trio recorded “That’s All Right” and began appearing around 
Memphis night spots, Moore dropped out of the Starlite Wranglers, and he 
and Black hitched themselves to Elvis’s star.
Dressing As the Hillbilly Cat
When looking at photos of Elvis with the Blue Moon Boys, you immediately 
notice that the Hillbilly Cat stands out. Moore and Black often wore their 
western-style Starlite Wranglers costumes or white shirts with ties. Elvis, on 
the other hand, preferred the style of clothing that black rhythm-and-blues 
artists often wore. (See Figure 3-1.) Flashy, hip, bold, and urban, this type of 
clothing could be purchased on Beale Street, where the black night clubs and 
hot spots were located. Among the most respected shops on Beale Street was 
Lansky Brothers, which was operated by Guy and Bernard Lansky.
Attempting to describe Elvis’s sound
When “That’s All Right” was introduced, and 
Elvis was nervously stepping in front of an 
audience for the first time, the terms rocka-
billy and rock ’n’ roll weren’t commonly used. 
Descriptions of his music in ads and posters, 
trade magazines, newspapers, and country-
western song books varied widely, indicating 
the problems that the industry had in categoriz-
ing it. The odd phrasings and unique terms that 
industry writers and music reviewers penned 
revealed the diverse regional genres that made 
up Elvis’s music. The inability to pinpoint Elvis’s 
music specifically suggests that no one realized 
that he had combined various regional sounds 
into an explosive new genre.
Writers groped for the right combination of 
familiar musical terms to convey what they 
heard. Many of them are downright amusing. 
Consider the following:
 ✓ On October 20, 1954, the Memphis Press-
Scimitar referred to Elvis as a “promising 
young rural rhythm talent.”
 ✓ The November 6 issue of Billboard identi-
fied Elvis’s style as “both country and R&B, 
and he can appeal to pop.”
 ✓ In a February 1955 article for the Memphis 
Press-Scimitar, reporter Robert Johnson 
described Elvis as “a white man’s voice 
singing negro rhythms with a rural flavor.” 
He referred to “That’s All Right” as “the 
R&B idiom of negro field jazz.”
 ✓ In the summer of 1955, the American-
Statesman of Austin, Texas, speculated that 
Elvis had a “boppish approach to hillbilly 
music” — that is “half-bop, half-Western.”
 ✓ The Cowboy Sings songbook (No. 44) 
offered this perceptive opinion: “The 
young artist has made both sides of the 
record [“That’s All Right”/”Blue Moon of 
Kentucky”] acceptable to a much wider 
audience than the usual song which must 
be put into just one category.”

Elvis favored pleated pants with wide legs. These pants virtually vibrated 
when Elvis bounced on the balls of his feet while performing. He seemed to 
like trousers with stripes down the sides, because years later several people 
recalled seeing him in pink-striped and white-striped pants. Big baggy suit 
coats in white or black draped his thin body, while brightly colored ties in 
gaudy patterns rounded out the ensemble. However, sometimes he preferred 
tight, high-collared shirts in bright colors with the sleeves rolled up. Pink and 
black were his favorite colors, so, of course, he wore a pink and black suit for 
his first appearance on the Louisiana Hayride. But, he also was fond of his sea 
green bolero jacket, which he wore with a mariner’s cap.
Elvis’s wardrobe was certainly atypical of the western-style costumes associ-
ated with both male and female country artists at the time, which featured 
kerchiefs around the neck, Stetson hats, and shirts embroidered with pat-
terns and trimmed with piping. However, some of these western costumes, 
such as those worn by Porter Wagoner and Hank Thompson, were actually 
quite gaudy with colored rhinestones and brightly colored patterns sewn 
onto the fronts, sleeves, and backs. So Elvis’s Beale Street clothing wasn’t any 
gaudier than that of typical country artists. Instead, he stood out because he 
dressed like African American R&B artists. Elvis dressed in his Beale Street 
attire both on stage and off, but he was fond of capping his look onstage with 
eye makeup and a carefully sculpted ducktail haircut.
 
Elvis’s ducktail hairstyle took a long time to perfect and required three differ-
ent hair products. He used a thick pomade to slick back the hair high on his 
head (though one carefully chosen strand always fell over his eyes while he 
performed). Another product slicked back the sides, and a third was used to 
form the central part that ran from the crown of the head to the nape of his 
neck. The effect resembled the rear end of a duck, so a less-polite name for 
this hairstyle developed: the duckass, or d.a.

 Chapter 3: Touring As the Hillbilly Cat and the Blue Moon Boys
Hitting the Road on the 
Country-Western Circuit
After the Overton Park Shell performance, Presley, Moore, and Black began 
to sing at tiny clubs around Memphis, such as the Eagles Nest, the Bel Air, 
and the Airport Inn. They also performed at the openings of shopping cen-
ters, using the back of a flatbed truck as a stage. Their public appearances 
were limited to high school auditoriums, small night clubs, and roadhouses 
in and around the Memphis area because all three musicians worked day 
jobs and couldn’t afford to take time off from work in order to drive long dis-
tances to shows farther away. Elvis still worked for Crown Electric driving a 
delivery truck, Moore worked at his brother’s dry cleaning service, and Black 
worked for a tire company. Because Moore had the most experience as a 
working musician, he served as the combo’s manager and arranged the local 
bookings.
 
The concert at the Overton Park Shell was Elvis’s first public appearance as 
a professional singer, but he had sung onstage for the first time about two 
weeks prior to that performance. On July 17, 1954, he sang two songs with 
the Starlite Wranglers at the Bon Air nightclub in east Memphis. Moore, who 
played guitar for the Wranglers, set up the appearance to allow Elvis some 
much-needed practice in front of an audience.
As the owner-operator of a recording studio, producer Sam Phillips knew 
many promoters, deejays, and other members of the music industry, and 
he moved mountains to get Elvis and the Blue Moon Boys on the Grand Ole 
Opry and the Louisiana Hayride. The trio’s infamous appearance on the Opry 
turned out to be a disaster, but their debut on the Hayride was a hit. After 
the success of the Hayride, Elvis and his band began touring in Arkansas, 
Louisiana, Texas, and other states where the Hayride broadcast reached. By 
late fall of 1954, all three band members had quit their day jobs. For better or 
worse, they were now professional musicians, and the road beckoned them.
In this section, I talk about the musical adventures and real-life exploits of the 
trio at the earliest point in their career together — a period often celebrated 
by biographers for the purity of the music and the anonymity of Elvis as a 
performer. From late 1954 to the end of 1955, the trio tore up the country-
western circuit as the Hillbilly Cat and the Blue Moon Boys.
Failing at the Opry
Overjoyed at the local success of “That’s All Right,” Phillips approached Jim 
Denny, the manager of the Grand Ole Opry, about booking the trio for the 
show. His argument was based solely on the strength of that first single and 
the idea that Elvis represented new blood, which heralded success among 

54
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
youth. Denny finally agreed to let the group sing one song for one perfor-
mance on October 2, 1954, provided it was the country side to their single, 
“Blue Moon of Kentucky.”
On the night of the show, Phillips drove the trio to Ryman Auditorium, home 
of the Opry radio show, in his four-door Cadillac, with Black’s doghouse bass 
strapped to the roof. The Grand Ole Opry as an institution was — and still 
is — devoted to the most traditional style of country music. Popular per-
formers sang live in front of a large audience, and the performance was then 
broadcast across the South every Saturday night by Nashville radio station 
WSM on a program called The Grand Ole Opry. The show was divided into 
segments, each with a different sponsor and headlining star. The perform-
ers who filled out the segments tended to vary from week to week based on 
whether they could fit an appearance in their schedules.
For the October 2 performance, Elvis was assigned to Hank Snow’s segment 
sponsored by Royal Crown Cola. It probably wasn’t a good sign when Opry 
regulars began to mumble about Elvis’s eye makeup as he mingled backstage. 
As the Blue Moon Boys began the song, Elvis bounded onto the stage where 
many a country music legend had been born, but the reception by the audi-
ence and some of the personnel was cool. Given the traditional nature of the 
Opry, Elvis and his revved-up music just weren’t suited for the show.
After the trio’s one song was over, Denny told Phillips that Elvis wasn’t a 
good fit for The Grand Ole Opry. The young singer was personally devas-
tated by the negative reaction, because he and his family, like most rural 
Southerners, had been fans of the program much of their lives. Scotty and Bill 
also felt low, but Phillips felt he had scored a victory by simply getting one of 
his R&B-influenced rockabilly singers on the show.
Hopping aboard the Louisiana Hayride
The Monday after the Grand Ole Opry appearance, Phillips booked the 
Hillbilly Cat and the Blue Moon Boys on the Louisiana Hayride, which was 
another live show broadcast over the radio. However, the Hayride was dedi-
cated to showcasing new styles of country music and attracted a younger 
audience than the Opry. In its six years on the air, the program had fea-
tured Hank Williams when the folks behind the Grand Ole Opry had turned 
him away. The Hayride organization had also discovered Slim Whitman, 
Webb Pierce, Jim Reeves, and Faron Young. The new trio fit right in on 
the Louisiana Hayride, which was broadcast on KWKH from the Municipal 
Auditorium in Shreveport, Louisiana.
On October 16, Elvis and the Blue Moon Boys appeared on two segments of 
the Louisiana Hayride radio program. Each time, they performed both songs 
from their first single. Response to his first appearance was tepid, perhaps 
because the singer was still reeling from his Grand Ole Opry failure. By the 
second segment, however, a large group of college students had shown up, 

55
 Chapter 3: Touring As the Hillbilly Cat and the Blue Moon Boys
and the reception was entirely different. The enthusiasm of the students 
lit up the room, making Elvis a bona fide hit on the program. The Louisiana 
Hayride organization contracted Elvis and the Blue Moon Boys to make 50 
appearances, which they fulfilled more or less over the next year.
They began touring with the Louisiana Hayride road show, which featured 
a diverse bill of some of the program’s most popular acts. The Louisiana 
Hayride live show paid Elvis only $18 for each Saturday appearance, with 
Moore and Black receiving only $12. However, hooking up with the organiza-
tion meant that their act was broadcast over a network of 190 radio stations, 
which gave them exposure for their recordings and promotion for their con-
certs. More importantly, the Hayride tours across the South maximized their 
exposure for their latest records. In 1955, the Hillbilly Cat and the Blue Moon 
Boys made $430,000 in royalties for their Sun recordings. (You can read more 
about the group’s Sun recordings in Chapter 2.)
Adding a drummer: D.J. Fontana
Between the three of them, the Hillbilly Cat and the Blue Moon Boys made a 
ruckus onstage at the Louisiana Hayride. However, when they were backed by 
the house band during their performances, they saw the benefits of adding 
drums to their live sound. D.J. Fontana played as the regular house drum-
mer for the program and whenever the trio performed on the Hayride radio 
program he backed them up. When the Hayride began booking the Hillbilly 
Cat and the Blue Moon Boys on tours with big-name country acts, Fontana 
went along as their drummer. Going on the road with specific acts wasn’t 
uncommon for members of the Hayride house band, but by 1955, he was on 
board as a permanent Blue Moon Boy. When Elvis’s contract was up with the 
Hayride, D.J. went with him.
 
Fontana’s impression of Elvis was a positive one from the beginning. He 
recalled in an interview: “Elvis had this charisma about him. I don’t think any-
body could ever put their finger on what he did or how he did it . . . . Onstage 
he could feel the audience out in about five or ten minutes. He knew the songs 
they wanted to hear for some reason, and he could work that crowd to his 
benefit. He was really good.”
Acquiring a manager: Bob Neal
In November 1954, Presley, Moore, and Black took another important step 
toward establishing professional careers when they hired Bob Neal to be 
their official manager. Moore had been serving as their manager for small, 
local gigs, and Phillips had stepped in to secure the important Grand Ole 
Opry and Louisiana Hayride bookings. But, neither one could provide the 
service of a full-time manager who was dedicated to tracking down bookings, 
promoting the appearances, and placing print ads.

56
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
Neal, who had put together the Overton Park Shell show in July, was a 
disc jockey for country radio station WMPS and had a lot of connections 
in the local music business. Excited by Elvis’s effect on his audiences and 
impressed with the young man’s drive and ambition, Neal took on the role 
of manager, thinking he was getting in on the ground floor of something 
special. Sadly, any plans for helping Elvis make it to the national level didn’t 
come to fruition for Neal. (See Chapter 4 for information on Neal and Colonel 
Tom Parker, Elvis’s legendary manager.) For the time being, Neal pushed the 
group’s records, booked tours across the South with big-name country acts, 
and handled all their business arrangements.
Becoming a hard act to follow
By November, Elvis felt secure enough to quit his job at Crown Electric, and 
Moore and Black soon followed suit by leaving their day jobs. The following 
January, manager Neal began booking them on a series of tours that kept 
them on the road most of the month.
Throughout 1955, Elvis grew more popular with young audiences, who could 
be loud, disruptive, and demonstrative during the shows. His shows were so 
high energy that he riled the audience up, provoking them to want more of 
the same. Traditional country acts who followed Elvis on the bill seemed so 
tame in comparison that most dreaded going on after him. In fact, sometimes 
promoters had difficulty placing Elvis on the bill. If he closed the show, his 
young fans grew restless waiting for him. But, if he performed earlier in the 
program, the young crowds, who were ramped up by his act, were often rude 
to the remaining performers, or they simply left. As the year wore on, Elvis’s 
high-energy shows caused complaints from the other performers and refus-
als to play on the same bill as the Hillbilly Cat.
However, not all country artists felt this way. Some, including younger sing-
ers such as Faron Young, Johnny Cash, Wanda Jackson, and the Carter 
Sisters, considered Elvis a kindred spirit, despite his crazy performing style 
and his tendency to dress in pink slacks, green bolero jackets, and fluffy 
shirts. When they toured on the same bill, Cash sometimes lampooned Elvis’s 
act a bit by mimicking his moves. It was all in the spirit of fun, and the young 
performers enjoyed their time together on the road.
Recognizing the Importance of Touring
Recording “That’s All Right” may have made Elvis a professional singer, but 
touring made him a success. The way to create interest in a recording artist 
during the early 1950s was to introduce him or her through radio airplay and 
then create a live stage act to generate record sales (which in turn generated 
even more interest in the stage act).

57
 Chapter 3: Touring As the Hillbilly Cat and the Blue Moon Boys
 
The two years that Elvis toured across the South with the Blue Moon Boys 
helped him accomplish several objectives that prepared him for national 
exposure. For one, touring with other country acts helped differentiate him 
from the pack, establishing him as a unique presence on the music scene. It 
also created a loyal following consisting of several age groups and types, who 
were eventually overshadowed by teenagers and young adults. Finally, it 
allowed him, and the Blue Moon Boys, to season the act, making it more delib-
erately provocative and exciting. During those two years, Elvis honed his per-
forming style from a random set of tics and moves into a sophisticated 
“dance” in which a series of calculated movements — hip swiveling, leg shak-
ing, finger pointing, chest heaving — elicited screams and squeals from his 
raucous audiences. This section details the impact of those two years on 
Elvis’s career and act.
One in a million: Standing out 
from the crowd
Elvis toured across the South with the biggest names in country-western music, 
from the legendary Mother Maybelle Carter, who was one of the first com-
mercial performers in the genre, to yodeler Slim Whitman and country 
crooner Faron Young. He also shared bills with other prominent and diverse 
country entertainers who sang in a variety of styles; some were very tradi-
tional and others were more contemporary.
Touring with a who’s who of country artists
Many overviews of Elvis’s career make the mis-
take of downplaying his country music roots and 
overlooking the caliber of performer he toured 
with on the country circuits. Much of the Elvis 
lore and literature reveals a lack of interest and 
understanding of country music, preferring to 
overemphasize the R&B roots to “prove” that 
Elvis was the true social rebel he was painted 
to be. But, it’s essential to recognize the country 
music context to understand the impact of his 
Southern background on his entire career.
Presley, Moore, and Black toured with tra-
ditionalists like Hank Thompson, the Wilburn 
Brothers, Webb Pierce, Hank Snow, and Jim 
Edward & Maxine Brown; crooners such as 
Carl Smith and Ferlin Huskey (later Husky); 
and contemporary country acts like Sonny 
James and Marty Robbins. All these perform-
ers became country music’s biggest artists of 
the 1950s and 1960s and influenced the genre. 
Elvis was even on the same bill as comedian 
Andy Griffith, who became one of television’s 
most beloved actors. Touring with these impor-
tant figures suggests that Elvis was considered 
a hot act on the country-western circuit and 
underscores his Southern roots despite his dif-
ferent look and sound. Elvis had a lifelong love 
and respect for country music, which comes 
into play during the last phase of his career. 
Having watched these legendary artists per-
form close up surely made an impact on him, 
even if it wasn’t immediate.

58
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
Country music is much more versatile and “elastic” than the mainstream 
media gives it credit for; the genre stretches to include many styles, forms, 
and specific regional sounds. While embracing traditional values, ideals, and 
sounds, country habitually absorbs influences from other popular genres, 
including pop, blues, and Tin Pan Alley.
 
Even though Elvis was easily accepted into the fold of country music, his full 
integration of regional musical styles made him sound quite different from 
the average act. Rockabilly, which fused the heavy beat of blues and rhythm 
and blues with a rocket-fueled country rhythm, was more than a new trend in 
country music; it was a forerunner to rock ’n’ roll. The singer’s limitless well 
of energy and his kinetic performing style also singled him out as different 
from standard country acts. And, if his sound and stage act weren’t different 
enough, his Beale Street wardrobe closed the deal.
Touring on the country-western circuit served to contrast Elvis with the 
other acts on the bill. Elvis’s unique qualities as an entertainer — particularly 
his singing and performing styles — were readily apparent to audiences, 
the press, record execs, and others in the music industry, because he stood 
out in comparison. His differences prepared audiences and industry folk to 
accept him outside the framework of the country-western scene when he 
took his career to the national level in 1956. (See Chapter 4 for more informa-
tion on Elvis’s breakthrough on the national music scene.)
Establishing a diverse following
Elvis’s fan base began to develop as soon as his first two recordings, “That’s 
All Right” and “Blue Moon of Kentucky,” hit the airwaves in Memphis. During 
his early career, Elvis’s popularity spread among diverse groups, including 
African Americans, country fans, and young audiences. I discuss these fan 
bases in the following sections.
Appealing to African Americans
Some of Elvis’s early audience consisted of African American listeners, 
because “That’s All Right” was played on black radio stations and on Dewey 
Phillips’s program Red Hot and Blue. (Flip to Chapter 2 to find out more about 
the flamboyant Dewey Phillips.)
Stories abound that deejays didn’t know whether Elvis was black or white 
when his career took off in the summer of 1954. Many of the stories were 
exaggerated and even romanticized by rock music historians, who tend 
to propagate Elvis’s image as a rebel and focus on his ties to R&B music, 
but some of the stories are true. A deejay named Early Wright, for exam-
ple, recalled that he regularly played Elvis’s records at his Clarksdale, 
Mississippi, radio station. When he invited Elvis to make an appearance on 

59
 Chapter 3: Touring As the Hillbilly Cat and the Blue Moon Boys
his radio program, Wright was surprised when a young white man showed 
up. Likewise some country stations refused to play his first single, because 
they thought Elvis was black.
Many African Americans remained fans after Elvis’s race was widely known. 
In 1955, Sun Records repeatedly filled and refilled orders for Elvis’s singles 
with R&B distributors across the South. The singer retained a following 
among R&B fans long after he signed with RCA in 1956. In a poll taken by 
Cashbox magazine of artists who dominated the R&B charts between 1949 
and 1971, Elvis was ranked 19th. He was the only white performer on the list.
 
After Elvis died in 1977, his status among members of the mainstream enter-
tainment press was at a low point. Outside of bona fide music historians and 
rock ’n’ roll writers, few discussed his significance as a musical force in their 
musings over his death. In fact, when attempting to put his career into per-
spective, many claimed that he had stolen the music of black performers and 
watered it down in order to cash in on the burgeoning popularity of R&B with 
young white audiences. They speculated that black audiences and performers 
must have resented him; surely he was no “King” to them. These biased crit-
ics and cultural pundits didn’t know of (or simply ignored) Elvis’s popularity 
with black audiences during the 1950s, which has been well documented by 
Michael T. Bertrand in his book Race, Rock, and Elvis (University of Illinois 
Press).
Attracting country fans and young audiences
After his appearances on the Louisiana Hayride, when he began touring the 
country circuits across the Deep South, Elvis was introduced to pure country 
audiences. He generally attracted the loyalty of country music fans who pre-
ferred the less traditional acts heard on the Hayride, but conservative coun-
try fans who turned out to see the other performers on the bill were often 
sufficiently amused by his raucous stage act.
As Elvis crisscrossed the South throughout 1955 on one tour after another, 
his fan base grew and became dominated by young audiences. He attracted 
teenage boys and girls and young adults for several reasons:
 
✓ The music, especially the beat
 
✓ Elvis’s age, which was obvious from his hair and clothing style
 
✓ The excitement of his performing style, which was revealed only 
through touring
As the year went on, the young fans, who were sometimes loud and more rau-
cous than typical country audiences, came only to see Elvis. However, that 
doesn’t mean that others in his fan base who weren’t as demonstrative, such 
as country fans or African Americans, stopped buying his records or listening 
to his music.

60
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
Shakin’ and gyratin’: Honing 
a performing style
The young female fans became unglued when Elvis shook his legs and swiv-
eled his hips. What started out as natural nervous movements to the beat of 
the music became a more calculated performing style as Elvis turned into a 
more seasoned performer. In this section, I offer some insights into Elvis’s 
trademark gyrations.
Refining his influential moves
By 1955, Elvis had begun to fine-tune his performing style, in which he moved 
his hips, shook his legs, and sometimes collapsed totally on the floor. He 
remembered the flamboyant movements of the gospel quartets he watched 
as a kid, the deep feeling of the blues performers, and the rhythm behind the 
R&B singers. He gradually combined all of these into a unique performing 
style, which, over the course of time, he used to work the audiences into a 
frenzy.
Bill Black also added entertainment to the show. He liked to dance and roll 
around on the floor with his huge bass fiddle. The group’s performances 
were sometimes considered too wild in small towns, and a few country sing-
ers didn’t like to perform after Elvis, because the crowd was too worked up 
after his act. (Flip to the earlier section “Becoming a hard act to follow” for 
more information.) However, in larger towns, they were a hit.
 
Traditional country singer Porter Wagoner, who also was a star on the 
Louisiana Hayride, recalled Black’s contribution to the onstage shenanigans 
in an interview for the book Elvis Up Close. “[Bill Black] got as much applause 
as Elvis did because he done this mimickin’ thing. Elvis would shake his leg 
and then Bill would just go crazy and shake his leg, ass, and everything else — 
really wild . . . Elvis would throw his guitar around his shoulder, and then Bill 
Black would try and do that with his big stand-up bass. It was real entertainin’. 
People would just tear the house down!”
According to Moore, Elvis’s trademark stage moves began the night he played 
at the Overton Park Shell on July 30, 1954. And, those who write about Elvis 
can’t help but emphasize his performing style at this time, detailing its effect 
on girls in the audience. In describing his stage act, most biographers and 
authors depend on the personal reminiscences of those who performed with 
Elvis, or those lucky enough to have seen him in 1954 or 1955. Some valu-
able sources of primary research are available, but you have to be careful of 
personal accounts, because they can be exaggerated, colored by emotion, or 
tainted by film footage and kinescopes of Elvis performing much later.

61
 Chapter 3: Touring As the Hillbilly Cat and the Blue Moon Boys
The impression left by these exaggerated accounts is that Elvis’s performing 
style was so instinctive that it blossomed almost immediately. And, inevita-
bly some variation of the word “hysteria” is used to describe the audiences, 
painting a picture of them as out of control. Elvis moved around onstage 
from the beginning, because he was naturally full of nervous energy and just 
plain anxious about performing before the public. However, it’s doubtful that 
Elvis’s performing style fully developed the moment he stepped onstage at 
Overton Park.
 
Instead, he most likely realized that his spontaneous tics and moves had an 
effect on the audience, and so he began to hone those moves in an effort to 
tease the audience and ramp up their reactions. Some of the onstage antics 
did turn raucous, and audiences did get out of control occasionally, but most 
likely the “hysteria” was more or less controlled by Elvis. Eventually, the inter-
action between audience and performer became part of the act — and part of 
the attraction of seeing Presley perform live.
On the edge of hysteria: One night in Jacksonville
On May 13, 1955, Elvis performed in a concert 
that has since become part of his legend. His 
performance is legendary not because of 
what happened onstage but because of what 
happened after it was over. Elvis was singing 
in Jacksonville, Florida, at the stadium where 
the Gator Bowl was played. Over 14,000 people 
attended, many of them teenagers and young 
fans who were there only to see Elvis.
That night someone accidentally left a back-
stage gate open and unlocked, and no one 
noticed that it was open enough for people to 
slip under. Elvis and the audience had really 
clicked during the performance, and so after he 
sang his last song, he jokingly remarked, “I’ll see 
all you girls backstage.” Moments later, when 
he was in the area marked off as his dressing 
room, about 50 screaming girls got in and began 
ripping his clothes off. They pulled off his suit 
jacket and ripped a ruffled pink shirt to pieces. 
Fearful of injury, Elvis began climbing a shower 
stall, only to have the girls pull his shoes and 
socks off. They were tugging at his pants when 
help arrived to rescue the stunned star.
The next day, the newspapers were filled with 
stories about girls ripping the clothes off the 
latest singing sensation. This story illustrates 
the effect Elvis had on the female fans in the 
audience. It also reveals what real hysteria 
was like. It was common at the time to refer to 
Elvis’s screaming fans as “hysterical” and the 
atmosphere at his concerts as “hysteria,” but 
most of the time Elvis controlled the reaction of 
the fans to a large extent. However, this inci-
dent revealed what could happen when fans 
crossed the line into true hysteria.

Part I: Getting in the Groove: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
Using rare new footage to reevaluate Elvis’s performing style
Recently, rare film footage of Elvis from 1955 surfaced, and it clearly supports 
the idea that his performing style evolved during the year and a half that he 
toured. It also showed that a Presley concert wasn’t always defined by hys-
terical girls. The 8mm color footage is silent, but it shows a 20-year-old Elvis 
singing on an outdoor stage at Magnolia Gardens in Houston on April 24, 
1955. The footage was shot by a pair of newlyweds who were eager to try out 
their new camera. The pair was close to the elevated stage and to the left of 
Elvis, so the angle clearly captures the singer as he moves about the stage.
Those familiar with Elvis’s performing style will recognize some of his trade-
mark moves in this footage: He continually bounces on the balls of his feet as 
he sings, and on occasion he stands back to swivel his hips. But, these move-
ments lack the drama of his later television performances after he becomes 
a national sensation. Here, on this sunny day in Houston, Elvis spends most 
of his performance pacing from the back of the stage, where Moore is play-
ing the guitar, to the front to sing into the microphone. While not much of 
the audience is visible, a couple of girls can be seen calmly sitting on the 
end of the stage looking out into the crowd; others stroll leisurely in front of 
the camera. The scene stands in marked contrast to his later concerts in the 
same way that his stage act lacks the calculation and interaction between 
performer and audience of his later shows. Available as an extra on the DVD 
collection Elvis: The Ed Sullivan Shows from Image Entertainment, the footage 
adds a new perspective on the development of Elvis’s performing style.
 
This recently found footage makes another point: Elvis may be one of the 
most written about celebrities in the history of entertainment, but that doesn’t 
mean that there isn’t anything new to discover about him. New evidence can 
shed light on his music, his performing style, or his career; new perspectives 
can change the critical perception of him and his impact on American culture. 
With a cultural figure as significant as Elvis, the book is never closed.

Shocking America: Elvis Becomes 
a National Sensation
In This Chapter
▶ Meeting Colonel Tom Parker
▶ Recording for RCA
▶ Examining Elvis’s appearances on television
A
s Elvis rocked his way across the South in 1955, touring with big-name 
country stars, he attracted the attention of major record labels. Buzz 
about the crazy Hillbilly Cat and his very vocal fans suggested to many in the 
music industry that he was capable of breaking out of the regional market to 
become a national success.
Country-western promoter and ex-carnival operator Colonel Tom Parker 
began watching the young singer in the late winter, and before the year was 
out, he had become a part of Presley’s team. He negotiated a contract with 
nationally based RCA Victor that included a buyout of Elvis’s existing con-
tract with Sun Records. Some execs at RCA didn’t know what to make of the 
strangely dressed singer with the organic approach to recording, but his first 
singles for the company were instant hits. Part of the plan to launch their 
new property was to gain national exposure on the many television variety 
shows that dominated programming during the 1950s. To that end, they suc-
ceeded in ways that they could never have foreseen.
After debuting on Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey’s Stage Show, Elvis created a 
national scandal when he performed on The Milton Berle Show, setting off a 
controversy that heated up throughout 1956 and culminated with his infa-
mous appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show in which he was filmed only from 
the waist up. The controversy dogged him throughout the 1950s.
In this chapter, I chronicle the biggest year in Elvis Presley’s life — 1956 — the 
year he launched his career on a national stage. Elvis was propelled into a level 
of fame that he would never escape, and American culture was changed forever.

Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
Meeting Colonel Tom Parker
Biographies of Elvis Presley penned by both professionals and personal 
acquaintances often paint Colonel Tom Parker as the villain in the story. 
Parker’s background as a carnival barker when he was a young man in 
Florida made him easy to underestimate. Elitist writers often looked down on 
his persona as an old-time carny hustler who relied on unsophisticated pro-
motional stunts, exploitation tactics, and the merchandising of cheap prod-
ucts to build his client’s career. After Elvis died, the Colonel revealed his true 
identity, which showed that his exaggerated stories about himself and his 
outrageous persona allowed him to deflect attention from his real past.
Parker was the force behind Elvis’s evolution from a regionally based country 
performer to a nationally known rock ’n’ roll star. Parker first saw Presley in 
early 1955 and watched as he grew into a unique performer whose charisma 
attracted the most rabid fans. Parker eventually stepped in to become a part 
of the action.
The Colonel realized a recording contract from a major company was neces-
sary to reach a mainstream audience, which meant the highest level of popu-
larity and financial success. He had contacts at RCA Victor and connections 
with the William Morris Agency to facilitate Elvis’s introduction to that level 
of show business. This section tells the story of how Parker became Elvis’s 
manager and how he maneuvered his one and only client into the big time.
 
The “Colonel” in Parker’s name doesn’t refer to an official military rank. It 
comes from an old Southern custom of honoring a gentleman by bestowing 
the title of Colonel on him. The practice originated in colonial times when men 
of landed gentry were honored for financing the local militia, but eventually 
the title became a more generic tradition or custom. Usually the honor is spe-
cific to a particular state; in Parker’s case, he was named Colonel by Governor 
Jimmie Davis of Louisiana in 1948.
Uncovering the Colonel’s true background
From the beginning of his career in the music industry — long before he met 
Elvis — Parker played the old carnival huckster to the hilt, especially for the 
press, Hollywood studio executives, or any others he felt were underestimat-
ing him. He delighted in telling his old carny stories, making impossible deals, 
haggling over the tiniest detail in a contract, and complicating standard con-
tracts with unusual clauses and requirements. All these tactics were designed 
to give him an advantage in deal making, and they generally worked.
In truth, Parker’s exaggerated carny image helped deflect any serious 
inquiries into his past. Parker always told reporters that he hailed from 

65
 Chapter 4: Shocking America: Elvis Becomes a National Sensation
Huntington, West Virginia, which was a difficult fact to verify because the 
West Virginia state courthouse burned down decades earlier, destroying 
all the records housed there. It turns out, however, that the Colonel wasn’t 
Tom Parker at all. Instead, he was born in 1909 as Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk 
of Breda, Holland. Parker entered America illegally around 1929, perhaps 
by jumping from a Dutch ship docked in Florida. During the 1930s, he criss-
crossed the American South on the carnival circuit, doing everything from 
selling cotton candy to working as a barker (the person who lures customers 
to entertainment acts by shouting out their attractions). Parker began two 
carnivals himself before giving up the carny life to become a dogcatcher and 
later a promoter of country-western acts. As a successful promoter and man-
ager, he made important contacts in the music business that served him well 
when managing Elvis.
Parker’s real identity didn’t surface until 1981, four years after Elvis’s death, 
when the Presley estate investigated the former manager for mismanaging 
Elvis during the last few years of his life. When the estate decided to sue the 
Colonel, he revealed his true identity. Ever the slippery carny, he tried to 
claim that he wasn’t a U.S. citizen but a man without a country, which meant 
that he couldn’t be sued. The case was eventually settled out of court, but 
the news about Parker’s true past shocked the Elvis community.
Waiting in the wings to sign Elvis
In 1954, Parker was working as a promoter under the name Jamboree 
Attractions when he signed a talent and booking partnership with country 
singer Hank Snow. Parker would be in charge of booking acts for his road 
shows and handling Hank Snow Enterprises, which included radio, TV, film, 
and recording commitments.
In early 1955, Elvis’s manager Bob Neal signed Presley and his band to one of 
Snow’s tours. He and the band shared the bill with Snow, Mother Maybelle 
and the Carter Sisters, the comedian known as the Duke of Paducah, and 
Jimmie Rodgers Snow (Hank’s son). The Colonel took notice of Elvis, particu-
larly his energetic and intense singing and performing styles. Parker then 
decided to keep a close eye on the kid with the high-powered act.
In May 1955, when Elvis was mobbed by girls backstage in Jacksonville, 
Florida, the Colonel saw the near riot as proof of the boy’s star power. (See 
Chapter 3 for more information on this incident.) So Parker adopted a pro-
prietary attitude toward Elvis but said nothing to anyone about managing 
him. Part of his interest, which others on the tour began to notice, took the 
form of introducing Elvis to RCA scouts and promotion experts and persuad-
ing them to send the boy’s Sun singles to the executives in Nashville. He also 
began filling Elvis’s head with promises about his future career.

66
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
Making Elvis his sole client
In the summer of 1955, Sam Phillips of Sun Records leaked word to those in 
the business that he might be willing to sell Elvis’s contract if the price was 
right. This led Bob Neal to begin fielding inquiries from independent and 
major labels who wanted to buy out Elvis’s contract.
 
Selling Sun’s hottest property may have seemed crazy, but Sam had good rea-
sons for wanting to make a deal. Sun Records was too small to handle demand 
outside of the South, because it didn’t have a distribution network capable 
of meeting the orders that a nationally based singer would generate. Plus the 
company was already strapped for cash in trying to meet the manufacturing 
demands of their success thus far. Sam knew he would have to sell sooner or 
later.
At this point, the Colonel stepped in, first as a special adviser to Elvis and 
later as his manager. Parker would be instrumental in working out a deal 
between RCA and Sam Phillips — the deal resulted in Elvis becoming a 
national recording artist.
Becoming Elvis’s special adviser
On August 2, Elvis’s parents, Vernon and Gladys Presley, met with the 
Colonel about signing a contract naming him “special adviser” to Elvis and 
Bob Neal. Elvis’s parents had to sign the contract because he was under 21 
years of age. (You can read more about the Presleys in Chapter 2.) A second 
near riot in which fans ripped the clothes off Elvis’s back had occurred in 
Jacksonville that month, and Gladys feared for the safety of her son. The 
Colonel reassured her that he didn’t want a repeat of this type of behavior, 
but Gladys was still leery of Parker, so she and Vernon didn’t sign. At about 
the same time, the Colonel was talking up an RCA deal with Phillips, and he, 
too, was put off by the former carny and didn’t agree to the deal even though 
he knew it was inevitable.
 
By August 15, Elvis and the Colonel had worn down Gladys with the help of 
Hank Snow, whom Mrs. Presley admired. She, Vernon, and Elvis signed the 
contract naming Col. Thomas A. Parker as “special adviser to Elvis Presley 
[‘artist’] and Bob Neal [‘manager’] . . . to negotiate and assist in any way pos-
sible the build-up of Elvis Presley as an artist. . . .”
The Colonel began to edge out Neal almost immediately, and the country 
music deejay realized that his role had been diminished. One of the few tasks 
Neal did manage during this time was to put Elvis’s fellow band members, 
Scotty Moore and Bill Black, on salary instead of giving them a percent-
age of the take, which had been the arrangement thus far. Moore and Black 
wouldn’t necessarily make less money than they had up to that point, but 
they wouldn’t get a chunk of the big money that would come in after Elvis 
broke big either. Though both musicians balked at this change in status, 

67
 Chapter 4: Shocking America: Elvis Becomes a National Sensation
it was clear that the crowds were coming to see Elvis, not them. Plus, the 
Colonel was making noises about not using the two musicians at all. In the 
end, they accepted the deal, but the addition of Parker to the business deal-
ings changed the dynamic of the group. Parker’s lack of interest in the Blue 
Moon Boys was apparent from the start, and this drove a wedge between 
the musicians and Elvis. Black in particular disliked the situation — and the 
Colonel.
Using the deal with RCA to become Elvis’s manager
Parker spent most of the fall of 1955 working on landing a record deal with 
a nationally based recording company. He had connections at RCA, but he 
played them against executives from other companies in his efforts to get the 
best deal. Parker didn’t formally ask Sam Phillips’s permission to negotiate 
Elvis’s contract, which angered Phillips to the extreme. Phillips finally con-
fronted Parker and told him he would agree to sell for the outrageous asking 
price of $35,000, plus $5,000 for back royalties that he owed Elvis. The price 
was more than any company had ever paid for a recording star, and Phillips 
thought this would be more than Parker could handle.
By mid-November, the Colonel persuaded RCA to agree to this price because 
some of the execs knew Elvis was a hot property, and they were nervous 
about Parker’s threats to go with another company. On November 21, the 
deal was signed in the little studio at Sun. In addition, the Colonel had 
brought in Hill and Range music publishers on a side deal in which Elvis and 
the music publisher shared the profits on all Hill and Range–owned songs 
that he recorded (see the later section “Considering the role of Hill and 
Range” for more details). Figure 4-1 shows Elvis, the Colonel, and the RCA 
execs after their deal was signed.
 
Parker’s flamboyant personality comes through in many of the widely quoted 
remarks he made to the press, including this one: “When I first knew Elvis, he 
had a million dollars’ worth of talent. Now he has a million dollars.”
As part of his participation in the profits from the RCA deal, Neal agreed 
not to renew his contract with Elvis when it ran out in March 1956. Despite 
Gladys Presley’s suspicions and Sam Phillips’s reservations, the RCA coup, in 
effect, made Elvis Presley Parker’s sole client.
Neal wasn’t the only person edged out of Presley’s career. Parker also left 
Hank Snow behind in the dust as well. The exact details of this maneuver 
aren’t known, but many rumors, speculations, and half-truths exist. However 
it happened, in early 1956, Parker told Snow that he was concluding their 
business relationship, except for booking him for a few more dates. Snow was 
furious partly because he and Parker were partners in Jamboree Attractions 
and partly because the country music star felt he had helped land Presley a 
contract with RCA. Snow brought legal action against the Colonel, and the 
case dragged on for five years before it was settled in Parker’s favor.

Finding a Home at RCA
In 1956, as Elvis began his new relationship with RCA thanks to the wheel-
ing and dealing of Colonel Tom Parker (see the preceding section for more), 
changes were on the horizon. The Colonel and the execs at RCA decided to 
stop promoting Elvis Presley as only a country-western performer. Instead, 
they released his songs as pop music and promoted him on all three national 
charts — country western, pop, and R&B.
 
As odd as it may seem now, Parker and RCA didn’t even consider promoting 
Elvis as a rock ’n’ roll singer. Though rock ’n’ roll music had been around for 
a couple of years, it wasn’t considered a major genre of music. There were 
no rock ’n’ roll charts — at least not for a couple more years. As the year 
progressed, Elvis and his music started to be associated with the rock ’n’ roll 
phenomenon in the press until he and his raw, raucous sound epitomized the 
controversial new genre.
Elvis’s first recordings for RCA extended the sound he had developed at Sun 
Records, but the executives also tweaked it enough to push his music away 
from raw rockabilly toward a fuller rock ’n’ roll sound. In this section, I reveal 
Elvis’s initial experiences with RCA and analyze his first recordings. Finally, I 
discuss Hill and Range’s involvement in Elvis’s recording contract.
Working with Steve Sholes
Signing with a major label meant that a number of executives in RCA’s front 
office became involved in handling aspects of Elvis’s musical career. One of 
the most important in the early years was Steve Sholes, RCA’s premier A&R 

69
 Chapter 4: Shocking America: Elvis Becomes a National Sensation
(artist and repertoire) man. Sholes oversaw the recording and promotion of 
the company’s specialty singles, which included country western, gospel, and 
R&B, so he was closely involved with the details of Elvis’s first RCA singles.
 
Sholes, who was in agreement with the Colonel, wanted to release Elvis’s sin-
gles in the pop, country, and R&B markets. The idea was to promote Elvis as a 
pop singer — exposing him to audiences in the north, Midwest, and west — to 
increase his teenage fan base, while still releasing his records in the country 
and R&B markets in order to retain his existing audience.
Executives in RCA’s New York office didn’t always share the enthusiasm for 
Elvis that Sholes felt, and many were waiting for the veteran A&R man and his 
newest talent to fail. But Sholes and his battery of assistants and coordina-
tors went to work promoting their new artist in the entertainment press and 
rereleasing Elvis’s Sun singles on the RCA label. Hill and Range music publish-
ers also released a songbook of his hits.
Recording for RCA for the first time
Sholes assigned Chet Atkins, RCA’s music coordinator in Nashville, to orga-
nize Elvis’s recording sessions, which started on January 10, 1956 — two 
days after Elvis’s 21st birthday. Atkins not only worked as a producer and 
coordinator for RCA, but he also was a talented guitarist who released award-
winning instrumental records. Revered in the country music industry, Atkins 
knew a lot of talented sessions musicians. For Elvis’s first recording session, 
he arranged this solid group of musicians and backup vocalists:
 
✓ Scotty Moore and Bill Black: The Blue Moon Boys (see Chapter 3), who 
had worked with Elvis since his first single record, were hired to offer 
consistency from the old days at Sun to his new home at RCA. Moore, 
who admired Atkins as a guitarist and musician, was both thrilled and 
nervous to be there.
 
✓ D.J. Fontana: Fontana, who had toured with Elvis on the road but had 
never recorded with him, checked in on drums.
 
✓ Chet Atkins: The big man himself played rhythm guitar.
 
✓ Floyd Cramer: Cramer, a talented pianist who had backed Elvis on the 
Louisiana Hayride, moved to Nashville to work on Elvis’s RCA sessions. 
(Refer to Chapter 3 for more on Elvis’s involvement in the Louisiana 
Hayride.) He became one of the city’s most respected sessions musi-
cians and went on to record his own instrumental albums.
 
✓ Ben and Brock Speer: The Speer Family gospel quartet had just been 
signed by RCA, and Atkins invited two of the members, Ben and Brock, 
to provide backup vocals on any ballads that Elvis might record.

70
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
 
✓ Gordon Stoker: Even though he was a member of the Jordanaires, a 
highly popular gospel quartet, Stoker provided vocal backup without 
the other members (RCA had just signed the Speer Family, and Atkins 
wanted to make use of all or any of them wherever possible). However, 
Elvis took to Stoker right away, and it would be the Jordanaires who 
became his regular backup vocalists.
Session one: Nashville
A quick summary of the first RCA recording session in Nashville may be 
“Everybody’s nervous, except Elvis.” RCA’s Nashville studios were huge and 
the atmosphere was highly professional. Plus an uncertain Steve Sholes was 
in the booth riding shotgun on the engineers, and renowned musicians were 
on hand to provide support. If Elvis was intimidated at this complete change 
of pace from Sun Records, he didn’t show it — perhaps because he had 
sought Sam Phillips’s advice before coming to Nashville.
 
In Peter Guralnik’s Last Train to Memphis, Phillips recalled years later that he 
offered this advice to a nervous but excited Elvis after he signed with RCA: 
“Look, you know how to do it now, you go over there and don’t let anybody 
tell you — they believe enough in you that they’ve laid some cold cash down, 
so you let them know what you feel what you want to do.”
Elvis attacked his first song, Ray Charles’s “I’ve Got a Woman,” with every-
thing he had. In effect, Elvis performed the song while he recorded it, which 
impressed the cool, calm Atkins so much that he called his wife to come 
down to the studio to see the exciting Elvis. Most singers with training hold 
back during recording and focus on capturing a technically well-crafted ver-
sion of the song. Elvis, who wasn’t a trained singer, sank his heart and soul 
into each recording, giving his records an extra dash of vitality and intensity.
Elvis cut “Heartbreak Hotel” and “Money Honey” the same day as “I’ve Got a 
Woman.” The following day, Elvis recorded two ballads that Sholes had found 
for him — “I’m Counting on You” and “I Was the One.” Despite Elvis’s relaxed 
attitude and Atkins’s excitement over his recording style, Sholes and the RCA 
executives in New York weren’t entirely happy with the Nashville session. 
They were concerned about the following:
 
✓ At first, Sholes was disconcerted by Elvis’s organic, instinctual 
approach to recording. He didn’t like Elvis’s approach because it 
could potentially take up time (and time is money in show business), 
and because the level of emotion with each take was unusual. Elvis’s 
approach was to sing a take, play it back, discard it, and then sing 
another, repeating the process until he felt he had captured the tune.
 
 Elvis didn’t read music, nor did he have any professional experience at 
arranging it. He just instinctively knew what he wanted to do and when. 
And, each time he sang a song for recording, he performed it, giving it 

71
 Chapter 4: Shocking America: Elvis Becomes a National Sensation
the same level of emotion and expression as if he were singing it before 
an audience.
 
✓ Sholes and other executives disliked the way Elvis warmed up before 
each session. His warm-up consisted of singing a few gospel tunes with 
the Jordanaires or with other musicians who were there. The RCA execs 
thought it a waste of time, but the practice soothed Elvis’s nerves and 
focused his attention.
 
✓ RCA executives in New York were troubled with the sound of the 
Nashville session. They wanted Elvis to sound just like he had on his 
Sun recordings, and between the larger scale sound produced by the 
supporting vocalists and musicians and the inclusion of ballads on the 
song list, the work from his first session didn’t fit that bill.
 
“Heartbreak Hotel,” the biggest hit to come out of these first sessions, was pre-
sented to Elvis in November 1955 at a disc jockeys’ convention by songwriters 
Mae Boren Axton and Tommy Durden. Durden came up with the idea for the 
song after reading a newspaper article about the suicide of a young man who 
had left behind a bitter note that read: “I walk a lonely street.” As recorded at 
RCA, the song exaggerates the echo effect that was associated with his Sun 
sound, creating an eerie, downright ghostly effect as Elvis sings the opening 
lines to each verse. His voice is penetrating and the sound is despondent, per-
fectly capturing the alienation of disaffected youth.
Session two: New York
After recording for the first time in Nashville, a second recording session 
was arranged in New York for January 30 and February 3, because Elvis was 
in town to appear on television (see the later section “Taking Television by 
Storm”). During this session, Elvis covered Carl Perkins’s “Blue Suede Shoes” 
and Little Richard’s “Tutti Frutti.” He also cut Arthur “Big Boy” Crudup’s 
blues tune “My Baby Left Me,” among other songs.
This time, instead of having a huge clan of accompanying musicians, Sholes 
lined up only piano player Shortly Long in addition to Moore, Black, and 
Fontana. Long was a good boogie-woogie piano player, and Sholes thought 
Long’s style would work well with Elvis’s music. The focus during this ses-
sion was on explosive, fast-paced songs, because Sholes and RCA seemed to 
want something new and spectacular out of their latest singing sensation.
 
Exactly what RCA expected from Elvis during these first sessions isn’t known, 
probably because Sholes and the execs didn’t really know either. Sholes called 
Sam Phillips after the New York session and sought his advice about how to 
handle Elvis. Phillips basically told Sholes to leave Elvis alone and to respect 
the young singer’s instincts for selecting songs and cutting them. And so 
Sholes did.

72
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
Releasing an album: Elvis Presley
Eventually seven tracks from the Nashville and New York sessions were 
chosen for Elvis’s first long-playing album, Elvis Presley. These tracks were 
combined with five songs that were previously recorded at Sun Records 
but never released. The album, which was released on March 13, 1956, sold 
more than 360,000 copies by the end of April. At $3.98 per copy, Elvis Presley 
became RCA’s first million-dollar album by a single artist. It reached number 
one on the Billboard Top LPs chart, remaining there for ten weeks.
“Heartbreak Hotel” wasn’t included on this first full-length album. Released 
as a single on January 27, 1956, “Heartbreak Hotel” became Elvis’s first gold 
record and climbed to number one on the Billboard singles chart, where it 
stayed for eight weeks. The song also reached number one on the Billboard 
country chart and number three on the R&B chart. Given its quick success, 
the song might seem a natural to be included on the album. But, during 
this era, singles were much more important in advancing a singer’s career 
than albums, because they received extensive exposure on the radio and 
jukeboxes in addition to selling in record stores. Often, a singer’s strongest 
recordings were released to stand alone from an album.
RCA pushed Elvis hard the first year he was under contract. Later in 1956, 
RCA released a second long-playing album, Elvis, and an extended-play 
album, Love Me Tender, featuring music from Elvis’s first film. (For more on 
Elvis’s movies, check out the chapters in Part II.)
 
An extended-play album or, EP, is a multitrack record with approximately four 
to seven songs. Once a common tool in the music industry, EPs fell out of 
favor during the 1960s.
Tweaking Elvis’s sound
As Elvis recorded more material at RCA in New York and Nashville through-
out 1956, he moved farther away from the pure rockabilly style of music that 
he played at Sun Records. He selected more ballads to record, and his up-
tempo songs became fuller because of the number of musicians and vocalists 
backing him. The echo effect and reverberation, which were his trademarks 
at Sun, were discarded.
After Sam Phillips’s advice to Steve Sholes was borne out by the financial 
success of the singles and first album, the execs at RCA stepped back and let 
Elvis select his songs and record them his way. Sholes and others made sug-
gestions to Elvis about which tunes to cut, but he made the final selections — 
at least during this first year.

73
 Chapter 4: Shocking America: Elvis Becomes a National Sensation
By July 1956, when he stepped back into the RCA studios, Elvis seemed to be 
seeking a bigger, more explosive rock ’n’ roll sound. During this session, he 
recorded two of his signature songs, “Hound Dog” and “Don’t Be Cruel.” The 
latter became one of his most successful singles. In fact, as of today, it boasts 
triple platinum status by the Recording Industry Association of America 
(RIAA).
“Hound Dog”
In 1952, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller wrote “Hound Dog” — a song about a 
gigolo — for blues singer Willa Mae “Big Mama” Thornton, who growled the 
saucy lyrics to a hard-driving blues beat.
 
Other singers covered the infamous song shortly after Thornton, including 
country artists Tommy Duncan, Betsy Gay, Jack Turner, Billy Starr, and lounge 
act Freddie Bell and the Bellboys. Bell enlivened the tempo and tampered with 
the lyrics to add humor. He added the line of the chorus about the Hound 
Dog’s inability to catch rabbits.
After Elvis performed a scandalous version of “Hound Dog” on The Milton 
Berle Show and a notorious interpretation on The Steve Allen Show (see the 
later section “Taking Television by Storm” for details), Sholes pressured the 
young singer to record the novelty tune. After more than 30 takes, Elvis even-
tually captured a rousing rock ’n’ roll interpretation of the song, which he 
patterned after Bell’s but made more aggressive.
“Don’t Be Cruel”
R&B singer-songwriter Otis Blackwell wrote “Don’t Be Cruel” the previous 
year around Christmastime. The tune, which Elvis selected from a stack of 
demos, became the flip side of Elvis’s hit single “Hound Dog.” A relatively 
new tune, “Don’t Be Cruel” hadn’t been recorded by any singer prior to Elvis. 
Because the song wasn’t associated with any singer’s specific style, Elvis 
could make it entirely his own. The recording’s easygoing but fast-paced 
rhythm, light tone, and harmonious backup vocals by the Jordanaires indi-
cate how far Elvis had moved from his Sun sound.
Blackwell sold “Don’t Be Cruel” to music publisher Shalimar Music for $25 on 
Christmas Eve in 1955. Elvis’s parent publisher, Hill and Range (see the next 
section for details), acquired the tune, and the demo for the song was placed 
in the stack of potential material for Elvis to record. When Elvis wanted to 
record the song, Hill and Range told Blackwell that he would have to cut a 
deal and share the writer’s credit with Elvis even though Elvis didn’t contrib-
ute anything to the writing of the song. Blackwell was uneasy about the deal, 
but the talented yet down-on-his-luck songwriter realized he stood to make 
a lot of money from royalties — even at half credit — if Elvis recorded the 
song. He took the deal and later wrote additional songs for Elvis to record, 
including “All Shook Up,” “Paralyzed,” and “Return to Sender” (co-written 
with Winfield Scott).

74
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
 
Assigning half of the credit to Elvis smacks of unfairness to those who know 
little of the popular music industry, especially because Blackwell was African 
American. Many African Americans were cheated by record publishers and 
companies during this era, and Blackwell’s deal with Hill and Range seems to 
be an example of this. However, this particular situation is more complicated 
than it seems on the surface. While not every popular singer took credit for 
writing the songs they recorded, the practice certainly wasn’t invented by 
Colonel Tom Parker, Hill and Range, or RCA. It goes back to the 1920s when 
pop singer Al Jolson introduced it.
The practice derives from the fact that songs become hits because famous 
performers record them. After the song becomes a hit, other entertainers 
want to perform or record it, but the original singer responsible for its popu-
larity gets nothing unless he or she was the songwriter. Elvis may not have 
written “Don’t Be Cruel,” but if he hadn’t recorded, Blackwell wouldn’t have 
made the money on it that he did. Blackwell understood this, and when inter-
viewers later asked him about it, he wasn’t critical of the practice.
Elvis never revealed what he thought of this practice. However, in a couple 
of interviews from the time, reporters asked him about his songwriting skills. 
Elvis always noted that he had never written a line in his life, and that his 
songwriting credit was only a business practice. Eventually, this practice of 
assigning partial credit to performers became passé in the recording indus-
try, and Hill and Range abandoned it for Elvis.
Considering the role of Hill and Range
The Colonel insisted that Elvis form two songwriting companies shortly after 
inking his deal with RCA. The singer called his companies Elvis Presley Music 
and Gladys Music (after his mother, Gladys Love Presley). Both of these 
companies were under the umbrella of Hill and Range, which was affiliated 
with RCA through connections among personnel for the two companies. Hill 
and Range received half the income generated by these two publishing com-
panies, which were responsible for obtaining the rights to all the songs that 
Elvis recorded. The singer formed Elvis Presley Music and Gladys Music to 
handle only his songs so he could receive publishing royalties. No other sing-
ers were involved with these companies.
 
This setup with the two publishing companies was financially advantageous 
for Elvis because he received a publisher’s royalty and a performer’s royalty 
each time a song he recorded was broadcast. If he claimed partial songwriting 
credit for tunes he recorded, he could receive a songwriter’s royalty as well. 
This setup represents how well Colonel Parker understood the music industry 
at this time and how he liked to finesse his deals to wring out every last advan-
tage for his client. With these publishing companies, he arranged for his “boy” 
to get the maximum profit for each recording.

 Chapter 4: Shocking America: Elvis Becomes a National Sensation
Hill and Range employed songwriters to regularly write tunes for the com-
pany, which it kept on hand for the recording artists it had publishing deals 
with. Most of these artists were country singers, including Hank Snow, Lefty 
Frizzell, Ernest Tubb, and Eddie Arnold. The songwriters gave up most of 
their rights to these songs, which were published through the companies 
associated with Hill and Range, such as Elvis’s two companies. The role of 
Hill and Range was to provide the songs for these subsidiary publishing com-
panies and to administrate the rights and royalties. The songs were either 
written by the Hill and Range house songwriters, or they were obtained from 
freelance writers who recorded their tunes on demo discs in the hopes that 
Hill and Range would buy them.
Obviously, it was best for all parties financially if Elvis recorded only those 
songs published by his own companies. However, he wasn’t prevented from 
recording other songs. Eventually this arrangement with Hill and Range 
would stifle Elvis’s career, because the Colonel, RCA, and Hill and Range 
didn’t want him to record the music of outside songwriters. See Chapter 8 for 
more information about Hill and Range later in Elvis’s career.
Taking Television by Storm
The Colonel’s strategy for making Elvis a national star involved showcasing 
him on television, which became the most explosive part of his plan. It could 
be said that Elvis’s career and the popularity of TV took off at about the 
same time. However, even the Colonel couldn’t have anticipated what would 
happen to Elvis as a result of his television exposure over the next year.
 
Commercial television hadn’t been widely developed until after World War II, 
and it didn’t become popular with the public until the early 1950s, when coast-
to-coast broadcasting became possible. By coast-to-coast broadcasting I mean 
that a program airing on the East Coast could be picked up and viewed on the 
West Coast at the same time. Throughout the 1950s, TV became increasingly 
popular, until it surpassed the movies as America’s number-one form of enter-
tainment.
In this section, I examine Elvis’s television appearances throughout 1956, 
offering details of each performance and contrasting his act with typical 
television fare of the period. I also focus on the increased media attention he 
gained with each small-screen performance and the way Elvis was used as 
ratings pawn among the major television shows. I discuss the controversy 
created by his television performances in Chapter 5.

Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
Appearing on Stage Show
Colonel Tom Parker and Elvis signed a contract for the singer and his band 
to appear four times on a CBS television program called Stage Show, a variety 
show in which a selection of popular singers, dancers, and comedians per-
formed each week in front of a live studio audience. The show was hosted 
by two musicians who had been popular in the 1940s, Tommy and Jimmy 
Dorsey. On January 28, 1956, Elvis made his national television debut on 
Stage Show. The reaction of the in-studio audience to Elvis’s performance was 
strong enough for him to be signed to two additional appearances.
Elvis stood out like a sore thumb during his first Stage Show program, 
because the rest of the performers seemed tame in comparison. Ella 
Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan, who were well-known jazz singers, performed 
in evening gowns and sang in their established styles. Two comedians in 
nice suits did stand-up routines, while a troupe of acrobats, a young boy who 
played the organ, and other family-style performers appeared in other seg-
ments.
When it was Elvis’s turn, he raced on stage like he was shot out of a cannon. 
As he sang “Shake, Rattle, and Roll” and “I Got a Woman,” he constantly 
moved his body. During the instrumental break in each song, he stood back 
and shook his entire body to the beat of the music. A few girls in the audi-
ence screamed, which made the singer smile. In addition, his long, slicked-
back hair came tumbling down over his face when he moved, and the eye 
shadow around his eyes gave him a sleepy, sexy look. And clearly his Beale 
Street clothes were simply too hip for the house. Compared to the smooth, 
polished performances of the other guests, Elvis seemed wild, raw, and alien.
Elvis improved his performances each time he appeared on Stage Show. 
By the last two shows in March, he was an old hand at getting the studio 
audience worked up when he sang. For his last appearance on March 24, 
he waltzed out on stage, dramatically strummed the opening chords to 
“Heartbreak Hotel,” and then paused, waiting for the girls to scream. As he 
broke into song, he moved across the stage, shaking his shoulders and swing-
ing his legs. Certain moves were obviously designed to elicit screams and 
yelps from the girls in the audience, and Elvis’s smiles proved that he was 
delighted at this explosive effect on his female fans. He moved freely and 
loosely throughout the performance, making eye contact with the camera 
and the studio audience. He teased the women with his provocative moves; 
they screamed for more; he promised to go farther; sometimes he did. With 
each Presley appearance, Stage Show received higher ratings, but the show 
never surpassed its competition on other networks.

 Chapter 4: Shocking America: Elvis Becomes a National Sensation
Tearing up The Milton Berle Show
In the spring of 1956, Elvis appeared on The Milton Berle Show for the first 
time. The show was broadcast from the USS Hancock, which was docked 
at the San Diego Naval Station. Despite the novel location, this television 
appearance is barely mentioned in biographies or other accounts of Elvis’s 
career. That’s because his second appearance on Berle’s program completely 
overshadowed it.
 
All the rumors, criticism, and bad publicity surrounding Elvis and rock ’n’ roll 
snowballed into a full-blown controversy on June 5, 1956, when he performed 
for the second time on The Milton Berle Show. The Berle program was a vari-
ety show similar to Stage Show in that it featured a number of entertainers 
who performed their latest songs, dances, or comedy routines in individual 
segments. But, The Milton Berle Show was one of the most popular programs 
of the 1950s, and it had a higher profile among the viewers and the media. In 
other words, more people paid attention to who was on it and what they did.
That evening, Presley sang “Hound Dog” for the first time on television. He 
had heard the song during his disastrous Las Vegas engagement (see the 
nearby sidebar “‘Corn liquor at a champagne party’: A flop in Vegas” for 
details) and decided to include a version of it in his act. Because he hadn’t 
“Corn liquor at a champagne party”: 
A flop in Vegas
Colonel Tom Parker didn’t make many mis-
takes in guiding Presley’s career. However, 
he did make an error in judgment in April 1956 
when he booked his young singer into the New 
Frontier, a big Las Vegas hotel and nightclub. At 
that time, Las Vegas was an adult vacation spot, 
and the clubs preferred to book the big pop and 
jazz performers of the period, such as Frank 
Sinatra, Rosemary Clooney, and Louis Prima. 
The adult audiences at the New Frontier didn’t 
understand Elvis’s Southern-based rockabilly. 
After a few performances, he was bumped to 
being the second act, and comedian Shecky 
Greene took over as the top-billed act, with 
house-band leader Freddy Martin remaining as 
emcee. Newsweek magazine seemed thrilled 
that Elvis flopped, describing his act as “some-
what like a jug of corn liquor at a champagne 
party” (May 14, 1956).
Some good did come out of the Vegas trip, 
however. While there, Elvis went to see other 
shows at the clubs and hotels, including a show 
by dramatic pop singer Johnnie Ray. He saw a 
rock ’n’ roll group called “Freddy Bell and the 
Bellboys” in a small club. The group did an up-
tempo version of Big Mama Thornton’s blues 
tune “Hound Dog.” Elvis liked their version of 
the song so much that he decided to add it to 
his repertoire.

Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
recorded it yet, no one knew what to expect. Elvis appeared without his 
customary guitar, so his hip movements, pelvic thrusts, and leg shakes were 
more obvious than usual. As he sang the first verses and moved freely about 
the stage, the live studio audience of girls and women responded appropri-
ately with screams and yelps. This reaction encouraged Elvis to push his per-
formance farther. He slowed down the final chorus to a blues tempo, grabbed 
the microphone stand, balanced on the balls of his feet, and then thrust his 
hips forward toward the mike stand. The effect was highly sensual, if not 
sexual. The studio audience screamed with excitement. Figure 4-2 illustrates 
Elvis’s sensual performing style on the show that night.

Despite the positive reaction of the teens in the audience the previous night, 
the next day, newspaper articles expressed outrage over Elvis’s sexy per-
formance. Reviewers felt that he had gone too far. In fact, many compared 
his performing style to a striptease. John Crosby, a reviewer for the New 
York Herald Tribune, summed up what many believed when he called Elvis 
“unspeakably untalented and vulgar.”
 
Elvis’s performance on The Milton Berle Show gave the people who were 
critical of rock ’n’ roll a specific example to rally around. Parents, the media, 
religious groups, and even the PTA (Parent Teacher Association) expressed 
concern about the negative influence of this type of music.
Clowning around on The Steve Allen Show
Despite the criticism that Elvis received from his appearance on The Milton 
Berle Show, other television hosts were eager to have Presley on their shows. 
The controversy that Elvis created attracted viewers and increased ratings.

79
 Chapter 4: Shocking America: Elvis Becomes a National Sensation
A month after The Milton Berle Show, Elvis appeared on The Steve Allen Show, 
a variety series that focused on comedy skits. Steve Allen’s program had just 
premiered in June, and it was on at the same time as The Ed Sullivan Show. 
Sullivan’s program was considered the high point of variety programs, and 
Allen was determined to give Sullivan a run for his money. In the days before 
cable and syndicated television stations, competition for viewers among the 
networks was fierce. Allen knew that Elvis was a good choice to lure viewers 
away from Sullivan’s program.
Allen was a clever man. He wanted Elvis on his show, but he didn’t want the 
criticism. NBC-TV didn’t want the headaches either, so they issued a press 
release stating, “Elvis Presley will not be allowed to bump and grind.” Allen 
diffused the controversy over Presley by using comedy. Instead of having the 
hot, young entertainer perform in his usual provocative style, he asked Elvis 
to sing “Hound Dog” to a real basset hound. The dog sat on a pedestal while 
Elvis stood next to him in a tuxedo. The singer held the dog’s long face in his 
hands, and then belted out the song. The studio audience giggled, the viewers 
at home got a glimpse of Elvis’s sense of humor, and the TV critics had less to 
complain about. Elvis the Pelvis had been tamed — at least temporarily.
Later in the program, Elvis joined Allen, comedienne Imogene Coca, and 
fellow Southerner Andy Griffith in a comedy sketch that satirized country-
western radio programs like the Grand Ole Opry and the Louisiana Hayride. 
Many of the jokes were condescending toward Southern culture. Elvis said 
little about the Allen show at the time, but his friends claimed that later he 
revealed how angry and humiliated he felt by Allen’s manipulation of his act.
 
Fans were furious that their idol had been tamed, and they picketed NBC-TV 
studios the next morning with placards reading “We want the gyratin’ Elvis.” 
Elvis also was upset because he had been made to look ridiculous. Clearly 
Allen became the real winner that night, because his show beat The Ed 
Sullivan Show in the ratings, which was a major feat in the 1950s television 
wars. After those ratings were reported in the newspapers, Sullivan became 
the last variety-show host to ask Elvis to appear on his program.
From the waist up: Tackling 
The Ed Sullivan Show
Ed Sullivan, who had established his reputation as a savvy showbiz colum-
nist for a major New York newspaper, was a powerful figure in the television 
industry. An appearance on his show meant an act or entertainer had made 
the big time. It was like getting a seal of approval in mainstream show 
business.

80
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
The Colonel had tried to get Elvis on The Ed Sullivan Show earlier that year, 
but the showbiz legend didn’t want to pay Parker’s asking price of $5,000 for 
his client. Sullivan then publicly declared that he wouldn’t allow Presley on 
his show, because he wasn’t his “cup of tea.” This comment was an obvious 
reference to and criticism of Elvis’s sexy, hip-swiveling performing style, but 
ratings speak louder than personal taste.
After seeing the success that Elvis brought to The Steve Allen Show, Sullivan 
changed his mind. He wanted the good ratings that booking Elvis would 
bring, but Sullivan also knew that if he didn’t have Presley on his show, his 
program’s reputation as a showcase for the latest talent might suffer. So the 
Colonel signed Elvis to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show for an unprecedented 
fee of $50,000 for three performances. Elvis received a much higher fee than if 
Sullivan had signed him earlier.
Elvis appeared on the The Ed Sullivan Show on September 9 and October 28, 
1956, and on January 8, 1957. For the first two performances, he sang and per-
formed in his usual style, which went over very well with the audience, but 
the third performance became one of the most infamous in Elvis’s history. I 
offer the lowdown on each performance in the following sections.
The first two appearances
Sullivan himself wasn’t there for Elvis’s first appearance on September 9, 
because he was recuperating from a car accident. In Sullivan’s place, actor 
Charles Laughton hosted the show. Elvis appeared via network hookup from 
California, where he was shooting his first film, Love Me Tender. (See Chapter 
6 for more information on Elvis’s first film.)
For his first set on the Sullivan show, Elvis sang “Don’t Be Cruel,” “Ready 
Teddy,” and a shortened version of “Hound Dog.” He bounced on the balls of 
his feet as he sang, and, as usual, the girls in the studio audience screamed. 
In his second set, he introduced the title song from Love Me Tender by 
declaring it to be “different from anything we’ve ever done.” The audience 
screamed before and after the performance, but the sad nature of the ballad 
wasn’t conducive to the game he and the audience played in which Elvis 
twitched and the girls screamed.
For the October appearance, Sullivan was on hand to introduce Elvis for 
his three sets. Elvis sang the same songs as in his first performance, except 
that he replaced “Ready Teddy” with the ballad “Love Me.” As he always did 
during his songs, Elvis bounced on his feet, twitched his chest, pointed his 
finger, stretched out his arms, and generally teased the studio audience with 
his performing style. He smiled into the camera every time he made the girls 
shriek.
However, compared to his appearances on the Stage Show and The Milton 
Berle Show, this performance was relatively tame. It wasn’t until his third 
set, in which he sang “Hound Dog,” that he cut loose by swiveling his legs, 

81
 Chapter 4: Shocking America: Elvis Becomes a National Sensation
bouncing on the balls of his feet, twitching his shoulders, walking with a jerky 
gate, and gyrating his hips. But, he did cut loose, causing the girls in the audi-
ence to scream throughout the entire performance. Elvis also let his sense of 
humor come through, lampooning his own performance by rolling his eyes 
during “Love Me Tender” and introducing “Hound Dog” as “one of the sad-
dest songs we’ve ever heard.”
The infamous appearance
For his last appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show in January 1957, Elvis sang 
a medley of his biggest hits of the moment: “Don’t Be Cruel,” “When My Blue 
Moon Turns to Gold Again,” and “Too Much.” For his third and last set that 
evening, he and the Jordanaires concluded with an a cappella rendition of the 
gospel classic, “Peace in the Valley,” which he dedicated to earthquake vic-
tims in Hungary. After the performance, Sullivan declared on camera to the 
whole television viewing audience that Elvis Presley was “a real decent, fine 
boy” and “a nice person.” The statement was considered a validation of Elvis 
by Sullivan, and the singer appreciated the gesture.
 
Comedienne Carol Burnett made her national television debut the night Elvis 
made his third and final appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. Oddly, few, if 
any, have asked Burnett her impressions of this infamous night in television 
history.
 
Of course, what was infamous about Elvis’s final appearance, which has since 
gone down in pop culture history as a symbol of the clash between genera-
tions, was the censorship of the singer’s performing style. Sullivan and the 
network censors at CBS decided that the cameras should film Presley only 
from the waist up so that his provocative hip movements couldn’t be seen. 
In effect, however, the edict only served to focus attention on Elvis’s move-
ments. Dressed in one of his Beale Street specials, Elvis stepped in front of the 
camera, complete with eye makeup and proceeded to give the live audience 
his full array of trademark tics, moves, and gyrations, causing the audience 
to be even more vocal than usual. The audience at home could only imagine 
what he was doing with those hips; and their imagination was more effective 
than if they had actually seen him.
Much speculation exists on why Sullivan and CBS decided to censor Elvis’s 
third appearance but not his first and second. Of course, the exact reason 
will never be known. The simplest explanations maintain that Sullivan was 
merely succumbing to the heated controversy that had swirled around Elvis 
for several months. However, quite possibly, the waist-up order was moti-
vated by the provocative performance during the third set of Elvis’s previous 
appearance. In looking back over the three Sullivan appearances, the legend-
ary host and the censors most likely noticed that during his third set on the 
October 28 show, he swiveled and gyrated much more than he previously 
had. The eruptions from the audience were more vocal, and the performance 
was closer to his appearance on The Milton Berle Show, which was the light-
ning rod for the storm of controversy that year.

82
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
Other explanations for the censorship are much more colorful. In a taped 
interview on the DVD release Elvis: The Ed Sullivan Shows, Marlo Lewis, who 
was a producer on the Sullivan show from 1948 to 1959, claims that many on 
the Sullivan show heard a rumor that Elvis had placed a Coke bottle down 
his pants for that last set of his October 28 appearance. When he bounced 
and moved around, the Coke bottle gave an obscene impression through 
his pants. Based on that rumor Sullivan gave the waist-up order for the final 
appearance, but this story is little more than an urban legend. Other versions 
of the story insist that Elvis had placed an empty toilet paper roll down his 
pants to produce a similar impression.
 
Whatever the reasons for the decision, the incident has become part of the 
Elvis Presley legend. It’s often used to illustrate how controversial the singer 
was in 1956. Some writers have exaggerated the incident by claiming he 
was censored on television on several occasions. But, the waist-up rule was 
applied to the singer only this one time.

n comparison to the music scene of our contemporary era, which has 
brought us Madonna, wardrobe malfunctions, and rappers with “unique” 
vocabularies, the controversy created by Elvis Presley and his hip-swiveling 
performing style seems tame. Yet, during the 1950s, the controversy gener-
ated a firestorm of criticism aimed at rock ’n’ roll, teenagers and their tastes, 
Southern culture, and Elvis himself. Virtually every popular magazine, major 
newspaper, high-powered deejay, and self-righteous reporter in America 
weighed in on the trouble with Elvis Presley as though the moral fiber of the 
country depended on it. However, the intensity of the criticism — and the 
sheer mean-spiritedness of some of the comments — suggests that there was 
more behind the controversy than meets the eye.
In the 1950s, Elvis definitely had the country “all shook up,” and this chapter 
tells you all about the controversy, its deeper significance, and the path that 
Elvis and his manager took to deflect it.
Anatomy of a Controversy
Many attribute the controversy surrounding Elvis to a generation gap; in 
other words, teenagers fought with their parents over the adoration of their 
idol that the older generation didn’t approve of. A clash of tastes between 
generations was indeed part of the reason for the hullabaloo, but other, more 
complex reasons were part of it as well, revealing deep-rooted issues in our 
society and culture.

84
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
 
The controversy focused on Elvis’s raucous musical sound and his unique per-
forming style. It wasn’t only the provocative gyrations and sensual movements 
that were controversial, however. The impact these movements had on the 
girls in the audience was a concern as well. The controversy was ignited by 
Elvis’s television appearances in 1956 (see Chapter 4 for details about these 
TV appearances) and fueled by the increasing criticism aimed at rock ’n’ roll. 
As the controversy swirled around him, Elvis continued to tour around the 
country. Negative comments, false accusations, and rumors dogged him even 
in the South, where he had been touring since 1954.
In August 1956, Judge Marion Gooding in Jacksonville, Florida, ordered Elvis 
not to shake his legs and swivel his hips during a performance at the Florida 
Theater. He obliged, but when he wiggled his little finger on stage during 
“Hound Dog,” the girls in the audience shrieked anyway. Elvis had appeared 
in Jacksonville in 1955 shaking his legs and swinging his hips in his usual 
style, but nothing was made of it. But he had been billed as a country singer 
back then. In 1956, when he was called a rock ’n’ roller, that same perfor-
mance style was suddenly considered too sexy and dangerous. Clearly the 
reputation that rock ’n’ roll and Elvis Presley had earned by 1956 was much 
worse than the actual music or performances.
Obviously, there was more behind the backlash against Elvis than his sen-
sual moves. In this section, I dissect the controversy to uncover why young 
girls and other teenagers gravitated toward Elvis’s music to the dismay and 
disgust of older generations, how Elvis’s music upset the conventions of the 
music industry, and how the mainstream public and press revealed their 
prejudices toward indigenous Southern cultures through their criticisms of 
Elvis.
 
The backlash against Elvis revealed a chasm in America between different 
groups and cultures: young versus old; black versus white; working class versus 
middle class; and Southern culture versus mainstream culture. The success 
of Elvis Presley and the popularity of his music proved that regionally based 
entertainers who appealed to specific groups and subcultures could challenge 
established entertainment institutions and undermine mainstream tastes. On a 
deeper level, Elvis and his success showed that beneath the complacency that 
was generally associated with the 1950s, certain groups — blacks, poor whites, 
teenagers — were dissatisfied with the norms represented by the status quo. 
Fearful of the challenge to the mainstream tastes and norms that Elvis, his music, 
and his in-your-face performing style represented, the status quo criticized, 
ridiculed, and attacked Elvis, his Southern culture, his ties to black rhythm and 
blues, and his youthful fans.

85
 Chapter 5: What’s the Ruckus About: The Impact of Elvis the Pelvis
Weighing the backlash: Generational 
conflict and sex
Rock ’n’ roll had been in the public eye for about two years when Elvis signed 
his contract with RCA in 1955, and during that time, this new musical genre 
attracted the attention of young audiences. So-called authorities in music, 
psychology, education, and parenting feared that the raw sounds and “jungle 
beat” of rock ’n’ roll led to juvenile delinquency and an increased desire to 
engage in sex. From April through October 1956, a wave of articles discussing 
the link between rock ’n’ roll, sex, and juvenile crime was published in popu-
lar magazines, including Time, Newsweek, Life, Look, Collier’s, and America.
During this same time frame, Elvis also was targeted by these magazines for 
his music, hair and sideburns, clothing style, and most of all, the effect of his 
performing style on teenage girls. It didn’t take a great leap of imagination for 
journalists, reviewers, and other critics to relate Presley’s personal appear-
ance and performing style to the decadency of rock ’n’ roll and the horrors of 
juvenile delinquency. The connection to Elvis’s music was made even though 
the singer, his manager Colonel Tom Parker, and RCA exec Steve Sholes took 
pains never to specifically label his music. They did this because they wanted 
to avoid the connection with rock ’n’ roll as much as possible and to promote 
his music in all markets.
 
Elvis’s appearance and performing style, which were exposed on national 
television, were at the heart of the controversy and led to the singer’s nick-
name “Elvis the Pelvis.” In retrospect, this aspect of the controversy has 
received the most attention; in fact, most now attribute the uproar strictly to 
generational conflict. Given American society’s prudishness regarding women 
and sex, seeing teenage girls act with complete abandon at Elvis’s concerts 
became more than parents and authority figures could bear. Interestingly, no 
one seemed concerned that young boys were adversely affected by the hip-
swinging walks of Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield, and the other sex symbols 
who were dominating the entertainment magazines of the time.
The following sections examine the way Elvis and rock ’n’ roll were depicted 
in the press and how this depiction exaggerated the perception of Elvis as 
profane and vulgar.
Linking Elvis with rock ’n’ roll . . . and sex
A pattern emerged in the newspaper accounts and magazine articles of the 
mid-1950s in which the writers depicted Elvis as a threat to established 
norms of behavior and appearance. These writers continually harped about 
the following:
 
✓ The tastelessness of Elvis’s hair and clothing
 
✓ The similarities of his performing style to a striptease or burlesque act

86
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
 
✓ His Southern accent
 
✓ The destructive or hysterical antics of his fans
Comparing Elvis’s performing style to a striptease in mainstream magazines 
and newspapers gave it a lewd sexual connotation that alarmed the parents 
of teenage girls. Elvis’s appearances on television in 1956, which showed 
close-up shots of his hip gyrations and exposed the way he deliberately 
incited the enthusiastic squeals of the girls, only reinforced the comments of 
the press.
 
A sampling of the type of comments made about Elvis reveals how he was 
painted as a threat to the purity of young girls. Consider the following quotes:
 
✓ Look magazine (August 7, 1956) warned America that Elvis “wiggles like 
a peep show dancer” and that “Onstage, his gyrations, his nose wiping, 
his leers are vulgar.”
 
✓ Illustrated (September 7, 1957) noted that “his body, gangling and loose-
jointed, contorts from the hips down as if a whole empire of ants had 
invaded his pants.”
 
✓ Life (August 27, 1956) claimed that “He uses a bump and grind routine 
usually seen only in burlesque.”
 
✓ TV Scandals (as quoted in Elvis World by Jane and Michael Stern) must 
have really frightened parents with the comment, “What’s most appall-
ing is the fans’ unbridled obscenity, their gleeful wallowing in smut.”
The sexual connotations of his performing style weren’t the only accusations 
made against Elvis. Parents of teenage boys had cause to be just as nervous. 
Between April and August of 1956, these stories about the antics of teenage 
Elvis fans appeared in the media:
 
✓ An article in Life magazine titled “A Howling Hillbilly Success” (April 30, 
1956) claimed that fans in Texas were compelled to kick through a plate-
glass door to get to Elvis. The door was indeed broken, but there’s no 
way to know whether fans did it intentionally.
 
✓ The Newsweek article titled “Hillbilly on a Pedestal” (May 5, 1956) 
repeated several outrageous rumors told to reporters by teenage fans 
who were enamored by their idol’s rebel notoriety; they claimed that 
Elvis sold dope, had been in jail, and was dying of cancer.
 
✓ A report from Jacksonville, Florida, repeated in Life magazine (August 
27, 1956), claimed that teens were soaking their Presley records in water 
to make his trademark hiccups and syncopated lyrics more pronounced.
Identifying the youth culture
Few writers were perceptive enough to realize that the clash between par-
ents and teenagers over Elvis and rock ’n’ roll was mostly the result of a 

87
 Chapter 5: What’s the Ruckus About: The Impact of Elvis the Pelvis
burgeoning youth culture. During the 1950s, America experienced an era of 
prosperity, and the benefits of the boom trickled down to teenagers. Many 
teens worked part-time jobs and others received allowances, giving them a 
disposable income. In the past, teens worked to contribute to their family’s 
survival or well-being, but during the 1950s, middle-class teens were relieved 
of this responsibility by the economic prosperity. (Flip to Chapter 20 for a 
more detailed look at this burgeoning youth culture and Elvis’s effect on it.)
 
One author from the era proved to be more perceptive than most. John 
Sharnik of House and Garden magazine wrote that Presley and rock ’n’ roll 
shouldn’t be feared because neither was more than “background music in the 
war between the generations.” He rightly reasoned that adults were angered 
“that a distinctive [teen] audience exists at all, that within our own society 
there is a large, well-defined group whose standards of taste and conduct we 
find baffling and even terrifying.” He summed up by noting, “Youth is almost 
a national cult.” Little did he realize he was acknowledging what would be an 
American obsession for the next 50 years — youth.
During the 1950s, teens became a recognizable subculture, with their own 
clothing style, slang, social activities, and favorite movie and recording stars. 
The more their tastes were catered to by manufacturers, the entertainment 
industry, automobile companies, and others, the more they clashed with 
adults who represented the mainstream tastes of the status quo.
 
America’s teens weren’t the only young people to go crazy over Elvis Presley. 
In the Soviet Union, Russian teenagers who loved rock ’n’ roll were called 
stilyagis, and they faced far more than angry parents for being Elvis fans. 
Communist authorities banned rock ’n’ roll, forbade the sale of rock records, 
and condemned Elvis as a capitalist pawn. However, Elvis’s music was avail-
able on bootleg records that were sold underground. The records were cut on 
discarded hospital X-ray plates and sold for about $12.50 each.
Weighing the criticism: Rock ’n’ Roll 
versus Tin Pan Alley
Part of the problem that the music industry had with Elvis’s musical style 
was that it was based in regional sounds indigenous to the South. In addi-
tion, Elvis had broken through with a record produced by a regionally based 
company. His sound and music weren’t like those associated with the main-
stream pop music industry. The musical establishment resented the success 
of Elvis and those who followed in his wake, and the controversy surrounding 
Elvis the Pelvis in 1956 was undoubtedly exacerbated by this. This section 
explores the clash between Elvis’s music and the smooth sounds and conven-
tional styles of Tin Pan Alley.

Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
Touring Tin Pan Alley
The songs and sounds of Tin Pan Alley dominated the music industry from 
the late 19th century to the 1950s. Located along 28th Street between Fifth 
Avenue and Broadway in Manhattan, the original Tin Pan Alley consisted 
of several buildings and offices that housed the major music publishers of 
America. Music publishers, who had songwriters and promoters on their 
payrolls, kept their offices along this stretch of Broadway, and the sound of 
songwriters pounding out their tunes on worn-out pianos made for a noisy, 
cacophonous neighborhood — inspiring the name Tin Pan Alley.
Musicians, song writers, and song promoters (called pluggers) hurried in and 
out of these buildings, hustling the latest pop tunes to publishers who hoped 
the hottest band or pop singer would make everyone rich with a recording. 
Many of these publishers later moved and newer companies were established 
elsewhere, but the name “Tin Pan Alley” to represent the music publishing 
business stuck. Broadway and vaudeville theaters, nightclubs, and musical 
comedy venues thrived nearby, making New York a performing arts mecca. 
So, the state easily became the home of the mainstream music industry.
Many of the mainstream songwriters, composers, arrangers, and others asso-
ciated with Tin Pan Alley were European immigrants or the offspring of immi-
grants, so a direct connection to European styles was part of mainstream 
music. Other influences on mainstream songwriters and singers included 
Broadway musicals, vaudeville and music hall entertainment, and later 
Hollywood composers and songwriters. Music publishers, songwriters, and 
arrangers absorbed influences of various genres and styles, such as ragtime, 
jazz, and even Hawaiian music, but the pop ballad remained the dominant 
song type associated with Tin Pan Alley and mainstream music.
Clashing with Tin Pan Alley’s style and traditions
Under the direction of Sam Phillips, Elvis’s natural musical style fused R&B, 
blues, and country western. He was inspired by pop music and truly appreci-
ated all styles, but those three genres represented the main threads of his 
sound. Not only were these genres indigenous to the South, but they also 
were hard sounding, beat driven, and emotionally raw — the opposite of the 
smooth-sounding pop ballad. (See Chapter 2 for more information on Elvis’s 
unique style.)
Elvis first recorded at Phillips’s tiny Sun Studio, where blues, R&B, and some 
country acts cut discs, hoping to develop a career in music. Elvis’s singles 
were released through Sun Records, Phillips’s small label that distributed 
throughout the South. In other words, every aspect of Elvis Presley and his 
music prior to signing with RCA was outside the perimeters of the main-
stream music industry.

89
 Chapter 5: What’s the Ruckus About: The Impact of Elvis the Pelvis
As soon as Elvis was signed to RCA Victor, a nationally based record label, 
in 1955, industry insiders began to snipe, revealing the prejudices against 
regional music and its makers. At a music industry convention in November 
1955, rumors swirled over the signing of Elvis and what it meant to the 
industry. A Tin Pan Alley insider was overheard remarking that Sam Phillips 
recorded his artists in a closet, which was a snide comment referring to the 
tiny size of Sun Studio and Phillips’s irregular methods of capturing unique 
sounds. The person surmised that RCA would never be able to duplicate that 
sound again, so he thought Elvis was sure to fail at his bid to become a big-
time recording artist. This Tin Pan Alley insider must have surely eaten his 
words. As it turned out, Elvis became the most significant recording artist of 
the 20th century — and Tin Pan Alley disappeared by the early 1960s.
Considering the demise of Tin Pan Alley
Elvis can be considered the vanguard of rock ’n’ roll, and his large-scale suc-
cess in changing the course of popular music spelled the beginning of the 
end for Tin Pan Alley.
Adding insult to injury, rock ’n’ roll records were charted as pop music 
during the mid-1950s, because no chart existed specifically for rock ’n’ roll. 
So rock records competed with mainstream pop recordings for space on the 
same charts. As Elvis’s records consistently topped the pop charts in 1956, 
music industry veterans became more critical of this new genre and of Elvis 
himself.
Elvis’s music wasn’t the only music that bypassed Tin Pan Alley conven-
tions and the dominance of the mainstream music industry. Other rockabilly 
performers, rock ’n’ roll singers, and R&B artists, including Carl Perkins, 
Chuck Berry, and Bo Diddley, received national exposure through Northern-
based disc jockeys who worked for huge radio stations in major cities. These 
deejays not only began playing regionally produced records, but they also 
organized rock ’n’ roll shows in big-time venues to showcase nonmainstream 
styles of music. Elvis didn’t invent rock ’n’ roll, but his national exposure 
occurred at the same time that rock ’n’ roll was gaining popularity and 
notoriety.
 
If Tin Pan Alley resented the financial success and growing popularity of Elvis 
and rock ’n’ roll, then the entertainment press and mainstream reviewers, who 
were accustomed to the smooth tones of pop music, were openly hostile to it. 
Their comments were often cruel and demeaning, repeatedly referring to Elvis 
as a “hillbilly” in the most pejorative sense of the word, though they labeled 
his music rock ’n’ roll. A good example is the comment made about Elvis and 
rock ’n’ roll in Newsweek in an article titled “Hillbilly on a Pedestal” (May 5, 
1956): “Alleged to be a new kind of music . . . rock ’n’ roll is actually a coars-
ened version of what a “jump” band like Count Basie does with refinement.”

Weighing the subtext: It’s the 
Civil War all over again
Generally, the war of generations between teens and their parents overshad-
ows any other interpretation of the backlash against Elvis and his music. 
However, sometimes a music historian makes a case for racism as the reason 
behind the controversy. This argument claims that Elvis brought the music, 
culture, and uninhibited expression of African American R&B artists into 
the living rooms of mainstream America via national television. This pushed 
many folks of Middle America out of their collective comfort zones. Based on 
a few newspaper and magazine articles, this theory seems to be true in some 
parts of the South, but an extensive search of mainstream magazines and 
articles from the period discovers yet another cause for the ruckus.
 
The press and public were indeed “all shook up” over Elvis, but it had more to 
do with the singer’s background as a poor working-class Southerner than his 
predilection for singing R&B music. The subtext — or deep-rooted meaning — 
beneath the surface of the controversy suggests that Elvis’s “hillbilly” heritage 
was the basis for his alienation from the mainstream, and therefore part of 
the cause of the backlash. His “strange” accent, attire, music, and performing 
style, which were painted as “Southern,” made him popular and appealing to 
teenagers. However, this popularity threatened the tastes and cultural values 
of the mainstream culture. Insulted that their values were being undermined 
and threatened by Elvis’s and rock ’n’ roll music’s increasing appeal to young 
people, arbiters of middle-class tastes and values lashed out at Elvis with 
prejudiced comments and unfounded opinions.
In the following sections, I offer a provocative perspective on the role that 
Elvis’s Southern heritage played in the attacks against him and his music by 
major publications that were located mostly in the North.
Homing in on the word “hillbilly”
When nationally based magazines used the word “hillbilly” to describe Elvis 
Presley in 1956, they didn’t intend it as a suggestion of quaint nostalgia. 
The word was — and still is — used to refer to rural white working-class 
Southerners. While rural Southerners may refer to themselves as hillbillies, 
it’s most often used as a derogatory term outside the South, with connota-
tions of ignorance, backwardness, and gullibility. In most instances, the arti-
cles directly or indirectly implied that Elvis’s Southern background caused 
him to be outside the mainstream and therefore undesirable and even a 
threat. To the writers of these articles, Elvis’s Southern “hillbilly” background 
indicated a lack of taste and sophistication.
 
Article titles, such as “A Howling Hillbilly Success” (Life) or “Hillbilly on a 
Pedestal” (Newsweek), insinuated an insult as did certain descriptions of his 
music, such as “a moronic lyric in a hillbilly idiom” (Time).

91
 Chapter 5: What’s the Ruckus About: The Impact of Elvis the Pelvis
As far back as the 1920s, when the first country tunes were recorded by 
Northern-based companies for radio airplay, the term “hillbilly music” has 
been considered pejorative by singers who perform it. Music pioneer Ralph 
Peer, who first recorded authentic hill-country tunes and later became part of 
the recording industry, dubbed an early country act “Al Hopkins and the Hill 
Billies.” When Hopkins protested because of the name’s association with the 
negative stereotype of rural Southerners, Peer, who was from the North and 
didn’t understand how often the term was used as a put-down, insisted they 
keep it. By the 1950s, Billboard magazine discontinued the use of the term 
“hillbilly music” because of its negative connotation, opting instead for “folk’ 
and then later “country western.”
Insulting the singer’s accent
Northern writers and reviewers seemed preoccupied with Elvis’s accent and 
used it to ridicule his singing style by phonetically spelling out his pronun-
ciation of lyrics to imply that he was an alien “other” (or, at the very least, 
an unworldly outsider). Throughout 1956, phonetically spelling out Elvis’s 
accented speech became a norm for newspapers and magazines. The follow-
ing are just three of the many examples that offer an idea of this demeaning 
inclination:
 
✓ A short article in Time (May 14, 1956) referenced Elvis’s accent three 
times. A caption over a photo of Elvis in the recording studio read “Elvis 
Presley: ‘Hi luh-huh-huh-huv yew-hew,’” to ridicule the singer’s accent. 
The author also declared Elvis’s diction to be poor and attempted to 
prove it by again spelling out how he pronounced lyrics, thereby equat-
ing poor diction with a Southern accent.
 
✓ An article in Look magazine (August 7, 1956) quoted Elvis responding 
to allegations that his music was vulgar. Every time Elvis said “I,” the 
article spelled it “Ah” to refer to his Southern accent. Focusing on his 
accent in this way completely undermined Elvis’s point.
 
✓ Life (August 27, 1956) got in on the joke when they also phonetically 
spelled out the way Elvis sang a ballad as “Ah wa-ha-hunt yew-who, Ah 
ne-eed yew-who, Ah luh-huv yew-who. . . .”
 
Much was made of Elvis’s preference for sideburns, ducktail haircuts, and 
gaudy clothes. Because these criticisms of his personal appearance were 
made in the same space as the insults to his Southern accent, readers could 
infer that his lack of taste had to do with his background as a poor, working-
class Southerner. These criticisms all were part of creating the impression 
that he was a “Rube from Rubeville,” as the Spokane Review dubbed him on 
August 31, 1957. As a matter of fact, the media rarely mentioned Elvis without 
referencing that he was from the South, from Memphis, or from Tennessee.

92
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
Rooting out the real meaning (and it’s not pretty)
What were all the pundits really worried about? Well, the truth is that Elvis 
threatened the status quo, and the danger he really represented was the 
sexual threat embodied in his performing style. In the dark corners of the 
controversy over Elvis Presley lies the negative stereotype involving the 
“hillbilly” male full of animal magnetism who courts adolescent girls and 
takes one as his bride. In other words, the sight of a greasy-haired, strangely 
dressed Southern-born singer thrusting his pelvis into the television cameras 
while he sang “Baby, I wanna play house with you” to the willing teenage girls 
of Middle America was considered out of bounds by the status quo. And, the 
mainstream press and public reacted accordingly.
Cooling the Controversy
Colonel Tom Parker realized relatively quickly that the bad publicity over 
Elvis’s notorious rock ’n’ roll image was driving away the very audience that 
he hoped to attract. So he embarked on a strategy designed to counter the 
accusations in the press that Elvis was a threat to American society or a dan-
gerous influence on his fans.
This section offers an overview of the Colonel’s strategy, which included 
charity work, a merchandising deal, and a Hollywood makeover. Other events 
not orchestrated by the Colonel also helped generate positive, or at least 
neutral, press, including Elvis’s purchase of the mansion called Graceland 
located on the outskirts of Memphis. However, the event that really turned 
the tide in favor of Elvis was his induction into the army, which Parker 
exploited to “his boy’s” advantage. All these maneuvers and strategies served 
to cool the red-hot controversy so Elvis and the Colonel could successfully 
court a mainstream audience.
Countering the bad publicity
The Colonel fought Elvis’s negative image and reputation with his own 
tactics. On July 1, 1956, shortly after Elvis’s notorious performance on 
The Milton Berle Show (see Chapter 4 for more details), the young singer 
appeared on a TV interview program called Hy Gardner Calling. Each week, 
Gardner, a syndicated columnist, interviewed celebrities via telephone. The 
audiences saw the interviews via split screen.
Elvis’s appearance on Hy Gardner Calling gave him an opportunity to dispel 
some of the outrageous rumors swirling around him, including one that 
claimed he smoked marijuana to reach the frenetic state necessary for his 
performing style and another that claimed he once shot his mother. Viewers

 Chapter 5: What’s the Ruckus About: The Impact of Elvis the Pelvis
saw a gentler, more vulnerable side to Elvis, who admitted confusion over 
the enormity of his success and expressed disbelief that critics could find his 
music to be a negative influence on anyone.
Parker also made sure that Elvis was photographed while donating to chari-
ties, such as the March of Dimes and the American Cancer Society. Part 
of this charity effort involved Elvis’s dedication of the song “Peace in the 
Valley” to a Hungarian relief organization during his last appearance on 
The Ed Sullivan Show. (Check out Chapter 4 for more information on Elvis’s 
Sullivan Show appearances.) In addition, Parker allowed local high-school 
kids access to Elvis so they could interview him for their school newspapers. 
He would have professional reporters and photographers on hand to record 
Elvis’s generous gesture toward his young fans. Finally, stories about Elvis’s 
close relationship with his parents began to appear in print. And, the singer 
was careful to include in interviews that he neither smoked cigarettes nor 
drank alcohol. And, at this time, Elvis neither smoked nor drank.
Merchandizing Elvis like 
other pop culture figures
In September 1956, the Colonel signed a deal with merchandiser extraordi-
naire Hank Saperstein to put Elvis’s image on a line of products. Saperstein 
had merchandised other trendy figures of the 1950s with much success, 
including Wyatt Earp, the Lone Ranger, Ding Dong School, and Lassie. All 
these figures were connected to popular television shows of the 1950s. Kids 
across the country could find these all-American heroes pictured on every-
thing from lunch boxes to T-shirts. While most of Saperstein’s Elvis-related 
products were aimed at teenagers, Parker wanted Elvis’s likeness to be 
plastered on some kid-related items as well. He believed this merchandizing 
would not only generate a tidy income but also serve to connect his client 
with these other family-friendly characters.
 
If you were a teenager in 1956 who had just dropped by your local five-and-
dime store, you may have found the following Elvis products to your liking:
 
✓ Elvis Presley lipstick in Hound Dog Orange, Tutti Frutti Red, and 
Heartbreak Hotel Pink at $1 per tube
 
✓ A faux white-marble bust of Elvis for $2
 
✓ A silver-plated charm bracelet and necklace with a heart-shaped pen-
dant at $1 each
 
✓ Perfume with Elvis’s picture on the label, which was priced according to 
the bottle size

book in soft-pink faux leather
Going Hollywood
On a much larger scale than merchandising, the one aspect of Elvis Presley’s 
career that truly aided in overcoming his image as a dangerous rock ’n’ roller 
was his starring roles in several Hollywood films. Between 1956 and 1958, 
Elvis appeared in four films. Three of those films were loosely based on 
Elvis’s life and career, but they told fictional stories. While Elvis’s fans loved 
seeing their idol on the big screen, the films also encouraged older audiences 
to accept him and his music. Flip to Chapters 6 and 7 for a full account of the 
way movies helped soften his image during the 1950s and then change it com-
pletely during the 1960s.
Buying Graceland
By the end of 1956, Elvis had become so famous that he was forced to move 
from the small ranch-style house in Memphis that he had bought for himself 
and his family earlier that year. Fans had taken to hanging around the house, 
hoping to catch him at home. Any number of them could be found linger-
ing in the driveway, picking blades of grass from the lawn, or even listening 
outside the walls in hopes of catching a word or two from their idol. The 
Presleys were extremely grateful to fans for Elvis’s success, so they were 
tolerant of this behavior. However, neighbors weren’t so welcoming and 
brought a lawsuit against the family for creating a public nuisance.
In the spring of 1957, at the age of 22, Elvis purchased a small mansion on the 
outskirts of Memphis. The house had been named Graceland by the previous 
owners, and so Elvis and his family kept the name. Gladys Presley had seen 
the house first, and because she liked it so much, Elvis bought it. You can see 
photos of Graceland in the color photo section of this book.
 
The mansion was christened Graceland by the original owners, Dr. Thomas 
and Ruth Moore. Mrs. Moore named the estate after her aunt, Grace Toof.
Not long after Elvis completed the purchase, the famous Music Gates were 
added to the front to keep out fans and visitors. The wrought-iron gates fea-
ture two stylized figures of a guitar player with musical notes bridging the 
space between them. Supposedly, the notes represent the opening bars of 
“Love Me Tender.” Graceland would be Elvis’s primary home for the rest of 

95
 Chapter 5: What’s the Ruckus About: The Impact of Elvis the Pelvis
his life. Unlike other celebrities and movie stars, he didn’t permanently relo-
cate to Hollywood or New York. He preferred to stay in Memphis, the city 
he called his hometown. You can read more about Graceland and its many 
rooms in Chapter 19.
 
Newspaper articles about Elvis’s decision to live in the town where he grew 
up and the publicity surrounding his purchase of a big house for his family 
helped balance the bad press over his notorious rock image and the strange 
rumors about shooting his mother or taking drugs before his performances.
Serving in the army now
Elvis didn’t get to enjoy his new house for very long. At the end of 1957, he 
was drafted by the army. However, he was able to get a deferment for three 
months so he could finish making the movie King Creole (1958) before he was 
called up. (See Chapter 6 for more information about King Creole.)
On March 28, 1958, Elvis Aron Presley was inducted into the army. As an 
entertainer, Elvis could have joined special services, meaning he would have 
traveled around the world to entertain American soldiers wherever they were 
stationed. This tour of duty would have been much easier than what the aver-
age soldier went through. However, Elvis turned down the army’s offer to join 
special services, choosing to serve his country just like any other American 
soldier — which, of course, is how the Colonel played it to the press.
The Colonel made sure that the press had access to almost every stage of 
the induction process, from the time Elvis showed up at the Memphis draft 
board until he was carried away by bus to Fort Chafee, Arkansas, where he 
was indoctrinated. Elvis was photographed in his underwear being weighed 
by army doctors, picking out his fatigues, climbing on the bus bound for Fort 
Chaffee, and most famously, sitting patiently while an army barber cut his 
hair into an army buzz and shaved off those sideburns. No photos could have 
been more significant to improving his image than those of a wistful Elvis in 
the barber’s chair as the clippers peeled off inches of his hair. For two years, 
he had been dogged by constant criticism and mean-spirited attacks about 
his hair and sideburns. Not only did he willingly give up his personal look 
to serve his country in the army, but now he also looked like everyone else! 
Check out the color photo section to see Elvis in uniform.
 
Nothing the Colonel or Elvis did to improve the singer’s image came close 
to generating the level of positive publicity that joining the army did. And 
the proof was in the immediate change in attitude by the mainstream press. 
Life magazine, which had been highly critical of Elvis in 1956, featured three 
major articles from April through October 1958 about Presley’s army service. 
Similarly, Look magazine, which also had been highly critical of Elvis in 1956, 
gave the army story a great deal of positive attention.

Controlling the media’s access to Elvis
From 1956 to 1958, Elvis freely and honestly answered any question asked of 
him by the press with no interference from the Colonel. Reading only a few of 
the interviews and articles offers a nice portrait of a naive kid having the time 
of his life on a wild ride.
However, Elvis did make some offhand remarks and candid admissions that 
inadvertently added to his bad press. For instance, Elvis was often asked 
whether he was going to marry any time soon, and the singer was fond of 
answering, “Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” And 
during an interview with a female reporter in Texas, Elvis played with her 
hair and called her “Baby” throughout, which the reporter used against him 
in her critical article. These comments clearly didn’t help his image at the 
time, but Parker was soon going to rein him in by maintaining stricter media 
access.
After Elvis’s discharge from the army in 1960, Colonel Parker used the posi-
tive publicity over the singer’s army service to spearhead a campaign to com-
pletely obliterate the Elvis the Pelvis image. Elvis would change his personal 
appearance, give up touring to focus on becoming a Hollywood actor, and 
alter his musical style to lean more toward pop than rock ’n’ roll. Parker also 
would limit the media’s access to Elvis to avoid putting the singer in a situ-
ation where he’d make comments that could damage his newly formed image.
 
Access to the press was limited to whatever publicity and promotion the 
Colonel and others in charge of Elvis’s career wanted released. So, of course, 
this information didn’t dwell on rock ’n’ roll, his Southern background, or his 
candid comments. Parker preferred short-term press conferences in which 
several reporters were privy to the same information in an open forum rather 
than lengthy one-on-one interviews alone with Elvis. (You can read more infor-
mation in Chapter 7 on the transformation of Elvis after the army.)
Noting Two Touchstones 
in Elvis’s Personal Life
As the saying goes, when one door shuts, another one opens. In Elvis’s case, 
this adage applied to two major events that occurred while he was in the 
army. In 1958, his beloved mother, Gladys Love Presley, died, and toward the 
end of his tour of duty, he met Priscilla Beaulieu, who would later become his 
wife. This section offers a brief account of both life-altering experiences.

97
 Chapter 5: What’s the Ruckus About: The Impact of Elvis the Pelvis
 
Just as his service in the army did, both of these personal experiences — the 
death of his mother and his meeting Priscilla — matured Elvis. An older, more 
confident Presley emerged in 1960 ready to tackle the next phase of his career.
Suffering a terrible loss: The death 
of Gladys Presley
On August 14, 1958, just five months after Elvis went into the army, Gladys 
Presley died, possibly from heart complications due to hepatitis. Elvis, who 
had always been close to his mother, was devastated by her death. He broke 
down many times in front of reporters, friends, and family in the days before 
her funeral. Gladys had loved her son very much, and she had been his big-
gest supporter. Her death was the worst event in his life up to that point, and 
in many ways, he never got over the loss.
At the funeral, the Blackwood Brothers, the gospel quartet that had attended 
the Presleys’ church in Memphis before Elvis became famous, sang Gladys’s 
favorite hymns. Gladys was buried at Forest Hill Cemetery in Memphis, but 
after Elvis died, her remains were moved to rest beside those of her son in 
Meditation Garden behind Graceland.
After his mother’s funeral, Elvis was sent to Bad Nauheim, West Germany, 
to serve out his two years of military service in the 3rd Armored Division. 
The only concession the army made to Elvis’s celebrity was to allow him to 
live off-base with his family so he could have a bit of privacy. Elvis was well 
known in Europe, so living separately was necessary to keep him from fans 
and reporters. His father, Vernon, and his grandmother, Minnie Mae, joined 
him shortly after he arrived in Germany. They were later joined by various 
friends and cousins, because Elvis wanted to be surrounded by family and 
friends. With the recent loss of his mother, who had been his major support 
system, Elvis needed the support of his family and friends as well as the dis-
traction of a lot of company. As a matter of fact, he would rarely live without 
a houseful of friends and family again.
Meeting Priscilla
Toward the end of his tour of duty, Elvis met a 14-year-old girl who impressed 
him very much. Priscilla Ann Beaulieu was the stepdaughter of Air Force 
Captain Joseph Paul Beaulieu, who also was stationed in Germany. Elvis had 
been stationed in Germany for quite some time before the Beaulieus arrived, 
and Priscilla remarked to her stepfather that she hoped she would run into 
the famous singer while they were there. Captain Beaulieu was none too keen 
on the idea, remarking that he wouldn’t let her walk across the street to see 
Presley!

98
Part I: From Rockabilly to Rock ‘n’ Roll 
Elvis and Captain Beaulieu knew someone in common, U.S. Airman Currie 
Grant, who thought that Priscilla and Elvis would hit it off. He arranged the 
meeting between the famous singer and the pretty teen. He also vouched 
for Elvis with Priscilla’s father, who was worried about his daughter becom-
ing mixed up with a famous rock ’n’ roller. Despite her young age, Elvis and 
Priscilla dated frequently during the last few weeks that he was stationed in 
Germany. However, they were seldom alone, partly because Elvis preferred 
not to leave his house (and his house was always full of people) and partly 
because promises were made to the Beaulieus that Priscilla would be well 
tended. However, Elvis and Priscilla did manage a few stolen hours together 
in his room.
Priscilla went to the airport to say goodbye when Elvis’s tour of duty was 
over, and she was photographed by major magazines such as Life as she 
waved to him and cried. When he returned to the States, reporters asked him 
about her, but he downplayed their relationship, probably to protect her and 
her family from the press. Little did these reporters know that seven years 
later, Elvis Presley and Priscilla Beaulieu would marry. (See Chapter 7 for an 
account of Elvis and Priscilla’s marriage.)

Part II
From Hot-Headed 
Rebel to 
Hollywood 
Leading Man

In this part . . .
A
s far back as 1956, movies were used to make Elvis 
Presley more palatable to the mainstream public. 
Playing a version of himself in three of his first four mov-
ies appealed to his fans but also presented him as a sym-
pathetic figure to the general audience, which helped 
temper the controversy surrounding his music and per-
forming style.
After Elvis was discharged from the army, he and his man-
agement team made the deliberate decision to turn him 
into a mature, conventional-looking leading man to attract 
the broadest audience possible. He stopped performing in 
public and turned his attention entirely to the movies. 
Elvis supported this decision because he wanted to be an 
actor, but sadly his career in Hollywood didn’t turn out 
the way he wanted.
As his movies became formulaic, Elvis grew increasingly 
disappointed with his Hollywood career. This is one of the 
reasons his films have such a horrible reputation that in 
many ways isn’t deserved. In this part, I examine how 
Elvis’s image and music were changed as a result of his 
film career. I also talk about his films — the formulaic 
musical comedies as well as those that don’t follow the 
formula.

E
lvis’s career as a movie star began in 1956 during the heat of the contro-
versy over his singing and provocative performing style. In fact, Elvis’s 
entrance into Hollywood became a deliberate and important step in dealing 
with the controversy and expanding his audience beyond his teenage base. 
Elvis’s management team launched a film career for the singer in order to 
keep the fans happy while broadening his appeal and diluting the contro-
versy swirling around “Elvis the Pelvis” in the press. Elvis, on the other hand, 
had a loftier ambition: He intended to become a legitimate actor like so many 
singers before him. (See Chapter 5 to understand the significance of “Elvis 
the Pelvis.”)
 
Many biographers and rock ’n’ roll historians regret the impact that Elvis’s 
film career had on his raw rockabilly sound and his uninhibited, sexually pro-
vocative performing style. They bemoan the way the movies instigated the 
process of taming Elvis. In this context, his films are presented in a negative 
light. Yet, you must remember that conforming for a mainstream audience 
was the desired goal of Elvis’s management team. And, to some extent, that 
was Elvis’s goal, too. The fact that his movies brought Elvis Presley into main-
stream culture doesn’t mean that all the films are without interest or merit. It’s 
time to reevaluate his film career with more objectivity.
In this chapter, I discuss Elvis’s movie contract with producer Hal Wallis. I 
also take you through the first four movies Elvis made, explaining how and 
why these films incorporated aspects of the singer’s real life into the plots. 
Specifically, casting Elvis in Loving You, Jailhouse Rock, and King Creole 
served to create a mainstream figure out of a controversial star. This strategy 
became a model for later generations of rock ’n’ roll stars and rap artists to 
follow. Finally, I tell you how Elvis’s early movies helped reshape his contro-
versial image and set the stage for his career as a leading man.

Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man
Embarking upon a Movie Career
In 1956, Elvis was fortunate enough to attract the attention of Hal Wallis, one 
of Hollywood’s most successful and talented producers. Wallis had a reputa-
tion for spotting talented new entertainers and turning them into stars. Elvis, 
a lifelong fan of the movies, embraced the idea of becoming an actor, and so 
he eagerly put himself in Wallis’s hands. This section covers how Wallis came 
to sign Elvis to a contract and why the singer was so keen to shift gears in 
his career. It also details the importance of Elvis’s first film, Love Me Tender, 
which wasn’t produced by Wallis. The filmmaker lent his new star to another 
studio to make this Civil War drama, which in many ways is quite different 
from his other movies.
Signing with Hal Wallis
While looking for something to watch on television one evening in the spring 
of 1956, Hal Wallis stumbled across Elvis Presley on Tommy and Jimmy 
Dorsey’s Stage Show (see Chapter 4 for more information about Stage Show). 
Not only did Wallis find this hot new singer with the odd name “electrifying,” 
but he also realized that the effect Elvis had on the audience spelled movie 
magic. He recognized Elvis’s charisma as a performer, and he knew that Elvis 
could transfer that appeal to the big screen.
The next morning Wallis called Elvis’s manager, Colonel Tom Parker (often 
referred to as simply “the Colonel”), and arranged a screen test. When the day 
for the screen test finally came, a nervous Elvis performed a scene from The 
Rainmaker, which Wallis was in the process of adapting from the Broadway 
stage to the big screen. Elvis’s screen test was impressive enough for Wallis 
to offer him a three-film deal, with the option to renew. The contract wasn’t 
exclusive, so Elvis was free to make films for other producers or studios.
Wallis was a veteran of old Hollywood. He had worked his way up through 
the ranks of Warner Bros. from the publicity department to producer, begin-
ning in the 1920s. During the Golden Age of the 1930s and 1940s, Wallis pro-
duced some of the studio’s best films, including Casablanca, Sergeant York, 
King’s Row, and Now, Voyager. He formed his own production company in 
1944, releasing his films through Paramount and later through Universal. 
Over the years, he signed several prominent entertainers to personal con-
tracts (a contract with Wallis, not a studio), including the team of Jerry Lewis 
and Dean Martin, Shirley MacLaine, and Charlton Heston.
Wallis’s talents as a producer included his ability to match a performer to 
material that would showcase the newcomer’s unique qualities. To Wallis, 
this strategy was the sure path to stardom. His reputation reached back 
to his days at Warner Bros., when he cast stars such as Humphrey Bogart, 
Ingrid Bergman, and Bette Davis in their best roles. Not surprisingly, Wallis 
titled his autobiography Starmaker.

103
 Chapter 6: Taming the Rebel: Elvis Goes to Hollywood
With the approval of the Colonel and Elvis’s William Morris agent, Abe 
Lastfogel, Wallis devised a series of films that attracted Elvis’s fans but also 
appealed to other factions of moviegoers. The Colonel signed Elvis with 
William Morris, one of the largest talent agencies in America, in 1955 to 
help with bookings and mapping out his client’s future. In general, Lastfogel 
proved particularly useful in negotiations with studios and producers.
Following in the footsteps of Sinatra
Elvis loved the movies, but the key reason he embraced a movie contract 
at this explosive point in his recording career was because he personally 
believed that the most successful entertainers parlayed their recording 
triumphs into movie careers. He held singers such as Bing Crosby, Frank 
Sinatra, and Mario Lanza in high regard as role models because he admired 
the way they shifted from recording to acting. In interviews at the time, Elvis 
talked enthusiastically about how becoming an actor was a good career 
move. He noted that singers peaked quickly and then faded away, but good 
actors had long careers. He even speculated that he would make some films 
in which he didn’t sing, much like Sinatra and Crosby had done.
 
Elvis’s vision for his film career was to become a bona fide actor; his manage-
ment team’s goal was to eliminate the controversy surrounding the singer and 
broaden his audience. At first, Elvis’s goal for his movie career didn’t contra-
dict the Colonel and Wallis’s plan, but as time passed, his goal grew increas-
ingly at odds with theirs. This difference in perception between Elvis and his 
management team helps to explain his utter disillusionment with Hollywood 
later on and why he turned his back on his movies, even his good ones. Flip to 
Chapter 8 to find out more about the clash.
Evaluating Love Me Tender
Elvis signed his contract with Wallis in the spring of 1956, but the producer 
felt that he didn’t have the right material at the time to showcase the singer 
to his best advantage. So Wallis allowed Presley to co-star in a film for 
another studio while he developed a property (a story or script owned by 
Wallis) especially for his new star. Elvis’s first film became Love Me Tender.
Originally titled The Reno Brothers, Love Me Tender was produced by 20th 
Century Fox, with Elvis co-starring in a secondary role. The story involves 
four brothers whose lives are changed tragically by the Civil War. Elvis plays 
the youngest brother, Clint Reno, who stays home during the war to work 
on the family farm. Clint marries his older brother’s sweetheart, because the 
family thinks that the brother (Vance) has been killed in battle. However, 
when Vance returns home unexpectedly, the family is torn apart by the mar-
riage. After a series of bad decisions and mistakes in judgment, Clint is shot 
and killed.

Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man
The first film versus the typical film
 
In some ways, Elvis’s first film, Love Me Tender, released in the fall of 1956, is 
an anomaly in his career, because it doesn’t follow the characteristics of any 
of his other films. Love Me Tender differs from most of Elvis’s other films in the 
following ways:
 
✓ Elvis doesn’t play the main male character.
 
✓ It’s a period picture, taking place in the post–Civil War era.
 
✓ Elvis doesn’t play a character written especially for him.
 
✓ It doesn’t make use of Elvis’s iconography (see the later section “Telling 
Elvis’s Life Story: How His Movies Act As Autobiography” for more on 
how many of Elvis’s first movies echoed his life).
 
✓ Elvis’s character dies in the end.
Despite these differences, Love Me Tender set in motion a pattern that would 
typify the Elvis Presley picture. That pattern included the addition of songs 
to appeal to his fans and to exploit his participation. This pattern seems 
to make sense because Elvis was a singer, but it can be distracting in some 
genres. In Love Me Tender, for example, Elvis’s contemporary singing style 
is at odds with the period in which the story is set and detracts from the 
drama. When his character cuts loose on the Reno front porch with a rous-
ing rendition of “We’re Gonna Move,” it interrupts the story line instead of 
enhancing it.
 
Of the four songs added to the film, the ballad “Love Me Tender” is best suited 
to the story line. Songwriter Ken Darby reworked the Civil War song “Aura 
Lee” as “Love Me Tender,” adding new lyrics but retaining the melody. The 
ballad was released with slightly different lyrics as a single, and it sold a mil-
lion copies in advance, reaching the top of the Billboard Top 100 chart. The 
song’s success persuaded the studio to change the title of the movie from The 
Reno Brothers to Love Me Tender.
Elvis and his costars
The major stars of Love Me Tender included leading man Richard Egan and 
leading lady Debra Paget. Pairing Elvis with established actors helped him 
learn the ropes of film acting and masked his inexperience on screen. Egan 
mentored Elvis, who was working hard to construct a credible character.
 
With leading lady Debra Paget, Elvis established another type of “pattern” 
that would be consistent throughout his film career: He developed a crush 
on Paget, and he tried his best to win her affections. Elvis and Paget got along 
well on the set, but she didn’t return his romantic feelings, largely because her 
mother had bigger plans for her daughter’s career. Elvis would go on to make 
30 more feature films, and during the production of many of them, he found 
someone in the cast to date, often his leading lady.

105
 Chapter 6: Taming the Rebel: Elvis Goes to Hollywood
Telling Elvis’s Life Story: How His Movies 
Act As Autobiography
By the time Elvis had completed Love Me Tender, Hal Wallis had developed 
a suitable vehicle for Elvis to star in. A vehicle is a movie built specifically 
around a star’s image. For example, a producer may tailor a script to show-
case a performer’s talents, or he may shape a character to suit a star’s screen 
persona. Some vehicles are loosely adapted to the star’s special character-
istics; others are worked tightly around them. The star’s appearance in the 
vehicle is the guiding force in the film, deliberately overshadowing plot and 
character development. Elvis’s next three films, produced before he went 
into the army in 1958, were vehicles tightly shaped to his public persona.
Wallis ordered the scriptwriters to tailor Loving You and King Creole to Elvis’s 
image and talents, and producer Pandro Berman of MGM developed Jailhouse 
Rock especially for the hot new star. The films’ story lines borrowed heavily 
from the details of Elvis’s life and career. The strategy behind featuring Elvis 
in such deliberate vehicles was to ensure the support of his built-in fan base. 
Fans would attend the movies because Elvis was the star, but after recogniz-
ing that certain elements in the films were parts of Presley’s own story, they 
would return to watch the movies again as Elvis-related experiences.
A way to turn the scripts into vehicles for Elvis Presley was to make use of 
“the Elvis Presley iconography.” This iconography is a set of personal charac-
teristics and career events associated with the singer that fans were familiar 
with because of photographs, newspaper and magazine articles, fan maga-
zines, interviews, and public performances. While these characteristics and 
events derived from Elvis’s real life, they were simplified and codified into a 
blueprint for the scripts for his movies. When fans saw these characteristics, 
actions, or people in the films, they drew a connection between the fictional 
leading character and the real Elvis Presley. The Elvis Presley iconography 
included the following:
 
✓ Hair and sideburns: Elvis’s long sideburns and ducktail haircut, which 
he kept in place with three different pomades, was ridiculed in the 
press, emulated by teenage boys, and beloved by adolescent girls. (See 
Chapter 4 for more information on the criticism of Elvis’s personal 
appearance.)
 
✓ Clothing: Elvis’s colorful Beale Street wardrobe was distinctive and 
unconventional. Plus, there was one consistent style feature associated 
with his clothing that others adopted, too — the turned-up collar. (See 
Chapter 3 for more information on Elvis’s clothing style.)
 
✓ A taste for Cadillacs: As soon as Elvis began to earn some real money, 
he hit the local car dealer to buy Cadillacs and Lincolns, often in offbeat 
colors. The first Cadillac, which he bought for his mother, was pink; 
others were cream, baby blue, and purple.

106
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man
 
 On more than one occasion, fans discovered Elvis’s car in a parking lot 
after a concert and destroyed the finish by writing their names and 
phone numbers in lipstick or etching them in with nail files.
 
✓ Band members: Elvis’s backup musicians included Scotty Moore, D.J. 
Fontana, and Bill Black, and fans recognized their faces from Presley’s 
TV appearances. The Jordanaires also often provided background 
vocals, and they were known to the fans as well.
 
✓ Performing style: Elvis’s distinctive performing style, in which he 
gyrated his hips, shook all over, pointed his finger, and rocked on the 
balls of his feet, was the high point of a Presley performance.
The roles that echo Elvis’s life events also fit an archetypal story line that 
moviegoers of all ages would recognize — the show business success tale 
(see the later section “Explaining the success myth” for more information). 
In this type of story, a talented performer with a new style battles personal 
demons in his struggle to make it to the top. By repeatedly casting Elvis 
in this type of story, the films effectively suggested to audiences that the 
singer’s real-life career was no different than that of countless other singers. 
These films implied that even though Elvis’s music was different and outra-
geous by some standards, there was really nothing new — or dangerous — 
about Elvis Presley the performer.
 
The films were intended to imply that Elvis Presley was neither new nor dan-
gerous. Elvis’s management team sought to change public perception of the 
singer, but in real life, Presley was a threat because he changed the status 
quo. He influenced the tastes of a new generation, changed the direction 
of popular music, and brought the music of rural Southerners and African 
Americans into the mainstream.
The following sections discuss how each of these three films appropriated 
aspects of Elvis’s real life and career and fit them into the mold of a show 
business success tale. The films are discussed in order of release.
Looking at Loving You
Of all the Presley vehicles, the musical drama Loving You corresponds clos-
est to Elvis’s own life story. It wasn’t intended to be a biography, however. 
Released in July 1957, Loving You tells the tale of Deke Rivers, a young, 
working-class Southerner with a “boogie-woogie” singing style that drives 
the girls wild. Music manager and public relations expert Glenda Markle, 
played by Lizabeth Scott, realizes that Deke can tap into the youth market 
that her country band, the Rough Ridin’ Ramblers, can’t. Deke is a naive kid 
who doesn’t understand his effect on girls, but Glenda exploits his sensation 
and sensuality in publicity stunts that sometimes backfire. The press saddles 
Deke with a reputation as a troublemaker who incites teenagers to act out. 

107
 Chapter 6: Taming the Rebel: Elvis Goes to Hollywood
Deke becomes depressed and confesses to Glenda that his real name is 
Jimmy Tompkins and that he stole his name to cover up a tragic past. Glenda 
lands Deke a one-man show on television to prove that he’s a legitimate 
talent who isn’t just a bad influence on young people.
Behind the scenes
To ensure that Loving You captured the flavor of Elvis’s life as an entertainer 
and showed the excitement surrounding his performances, Wallis sent direc-
tor/cowriter Hal Kanter to observe Elvis in his hometown of Memphis and 
as he made his final appearance on the Louisiana Hayride on December 16, 
1956. (See Chapter 3 for more information on the Hayride.) Kanter was both 
shocked and amazed by this new singing sensation. He was amazed at what 
he called the “electric excitement” generated by Presley onstage, and he 
was shocked at the way the crowds forced the singer to live a sequestered, 
protected existence. Because of this firsthand experience, Kanter effectively 
captured both sides of Elvis’s fame in the script for Loving You.
Elvis as Deke Rivers
In Loving You, Deke’s rise to fame as a young Southern-based singer with a new 
sound parallels the beginning of Elvis’s own career, particularly the impact 
he had on the girls in his audience and the accusations that he incited acts 
of juvenile delinquency. The film also references Elvis’s country music con-
nection by showing Deke touring with a country band. (Refer to Chapter 3 for 
more information on Elvis’s early career on the country-western circuit.) The 
movie even hints at Elvis’s R&B connection when Deke belts out a wicked ren-
dition of “Mean Woman Blues.”
Loving You offers many obvious references to the Elvis iconography, which 
fans would have easily recognized. The following examples represent some of 
the most obvious:
 
✓ Hair and sideburns: A local troublemaker taunts Deke Rivers in a diner 
by calling him “Sideburns,” echoing the criticism Elvis received for his 
own side whiskers. Several scenes draw the viewer’s attention to Deke’s 
hair as well. In one instance, he combs it while looking in a mirror. The 
scene is similar to a famous photo of Elvis by Albert Wertheimer; in 
another scene, Glenda runs her hands through Deke’s hair.
 
✓ A taste for Cadillacs: Glenda buys Deke a white and red convertible as a 
publicity stunt. Near the end of the film, a shot of the car parked behind 
the theater shows fans writing messages on the car with lipstick. The 
shot is extraneous to the film’s plot; no comment is made about this 
defacement and the incident is never referred to in the film. Thus, the 
shot isn’t really part of Deke Rivers’s fictional story; it’s a depiction of 
an actual moment from Elvis’s life used to manipulate the audience into 
seeing the two as one.

108
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man
 
✓ Band members: Scotty Moore, Bill Black, and D.J. Fontana, who were 
Elvis’s real-life band members, make up the band that back up Deke 
Rivers. While Moore and Fontana don’t have character names in the film, 
Bill Black is listed as “Eddie” in the cast list. Most of their screen time 
finds the three of them playing onstage, but in one scene, they’re sitting 
around backstage with Deke joined in a brief conversation.
 
✓ Performing style: Deke’s sensual performing style, which is the same 
as Elvis’s own personal performing style, stirs up the local girls in the 
scene that introduces Deke to Glenda and the viewing audience. During 
the musical numbers, the fictional character of Deke slides away almost 
completely because he’s singing and performing exactly like Elvis 
Presley. At this point, viewers become aware that they’re watching Elvis, 
not Deke. Indeed, that’s the reason for seeing the film.
In the last sequence of the movie, Deke performs a concert that’s broadcast 
on television. This concert is reminiscent of the TV variety programs so pop-
ular during the 1950s. Deke is presented singing before an enthusiastic live 
studio audience. Elvis’s real-life parents, Gladys and Vernon Presley, are part 
of the audience and are clearly visible during a close-up.
 
During the production of Loving You, Elvis didn’t date costar Dolores Hart, but 
he did date one of the actresses who had a bit part, Yvonne Lime.
Exploring Jailhouse Rock
If Loving You exploits the well-mannered Southern boy that the Colonel 
touted as the real Elvis, Jailhouse Rock plays off the part of the singer’s image 
that’s associated with the tough rebel. Released in 1957, the film stars Elvis 
as Vince Everett, a working-class stiff sent to prison for manslaughter. Rude 
and ill-tempered, Vince learns to play the guitar from cellmate and former 
country-western star Hunk Houghton, played by Mickey Shaughnessy. After 
Vince is released from jail, he begins a career as a recording artist with the 
help of record industry veteran Peggy Van Alden, played by Judy Tyler. 
Peggy helps Vince develop a new sound, which begins to attract the attention 
of teenagers. Peggy and Vince fall in love, but Vince’s hardened attitude and 
cynicism cause the two to split personally and professionally. A tragic acci-
dent results in Vince’s change of heart, and the two are reunited.
Behind the scenes
Jailhouse Rock was produced by Pandro Berman and released through MGM — 
not by Wallis through Paramount Pictures. Wallis’s deal with Elvis wasn’t exclu-
sive, so the Colonel was able to make deals with other studios.

109
 Chapter 6: Taming the Rebel: Elvis Goes to Hollywood
Berman followed Wallis’s lead in rounding out the script by echoing parts 
of Elvis’s real life so that Jailhouse Rock would qualify as a Presley vehicle. 
However, Berman didn’t have a master plan in regard to Elvis’s career, 
because he wasn’t invested in it. Presley was tied to Wallis by a personal 
contract, whereas Berman was merely assigned to Jailhouse Rock by MGM. 
Berman never worked with Elvis again.
Elvis as Vince Everett
Vince Everett’s personal life had little to do with the real Elvis Presley, but 
the character’s rise to fame from country-western singer to rock ’n’ roll star 
to movie actor parallels Elvis’s own career path. Plus, Vince’s surly attitude 
and lack of respect for authority and convention posit him as a rebel, which 
was part of Elvis’s image as a rock ’n’ roll star. More importantly, Vince 
Everett radiates a sexuality that’s instinctual, animalistic, and dangerous — 
much like Elvis did when he performed. You can see a photo of Elvis perform-
ing as Vince Everett in the color photo section of this book.
 
In one of the most famous scenes in any of Elvis’s films, Vince grabs Peggy and 
kisses her hard on the mouth, but she’s offended by his “cheap tactics.” Vince, 
well aware of his effect on women, growls, “Them ain’t tactics, honey. It’s just 
the beast in me.”
As you might imagine, Jailhouse Rock is far less sentimental than Loving You, 
and Vince Everett is a tougher character than Deke Rivers. However, both 
films include many of the same references to the Elvis iconography. The fol-
lowing list includes iconographic references from Jailhouse Rock:
 
✓ Hair and sideburns: The film refers to the importance of Presley’s hair 
by using an ironic approach. Instead of giving the fans what they expect, 
the film offers a scene in which Vince’s hair is cut short while in prison. 
Elvis, as Vince, is framed in a medium close-up as the clippers plow 
through the long, thick hair. This scene must have been shocking to 
fans.
 
 Even though fans didn’t know it at the time, the hair that was being 
butchered so unceremoniously on Elvis’s head was actually a wig.
 
✓ A taste for Cadillacs: When Vince brags about making his first million, 
he asks Peggy what color Cadillac he should buy. Later, after Vince’s 
first hit record, Vince’s lawyer reveals while dictating a contract to a dic-
tating machine that the color is white.
 
✓ Clothing style: Like Elvis’s trademark turned-up collars, Vince wears his 
collars straight up throughout most of the film. Also, Vince’s liking for 
oversized pants, plaid or print shirts with rolled-up sleeves, and sports 
jackets that don’t quite complement the printed fabric of his shirts is 
very close to Elvis’s personal tastes in clothing.

110
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man
 
✓ Band members: Elvis’s real-life band mates Scotty Moore, Bill Black, and 
D.J. Fontana play three of the musicians who back up Vince when he 
records “Don’t Leave Me Now.” None of them have character names, but 
they’re Elvis’s musicians playing Vince’s musicians.
 
✓ Performing style: In some of the film’s musical numbers, including 
“Baby, I Don’t Care,” the fictional character of Vince Everett virtually 
disappears because the singing and performing styles are that of Elvis 
Presley. Again, the purpose is to collapse the character into Elvis’s star 
image to satisfy the audience’s desire to see Presley.
Turning King Creole into an Elvis vehicle
King Creole, a musical melodrama released in 1958, is set in New Orleans. 
Elvis stars as 19-year-old Danny Fisher, who lives in a poor neighborhood 
with his sister and weak-willed father. Danny works in the clubs in the French 
Quarter as a busboy to earn money for the family, but his father is repeatedly 
disappointed in him, especially after Danny is prevented from graduating 
high school because of his bad attitude. When a club owner hears him sing, 
Danny lands a job as a regular performer at the King Creole nightclub. The 
singer’s life is complicated by his father’s disapproval of his profession of 
choice and by his involvement with local racketeer Maxie Fields, played by 
Walter Matthau, and Maxie’s girlfriend, played by Carolyn Jones.
Behind the scenes
King Creole was based on the novel A Stone for Danny Fisher by Harold 
Robbins. In the novel, Danny lives in New York and is an aspiring boxer. The 
original script followed the novel more closely, and at that time, newcomer 
Ben Gazzara was tapped to play Danny Fisher. When that deal fell through, 
Hal Wallis had the script rewritten as a vehicle for Elvis. The locale was 
changed to musical New Orleans, and Danny’s desired profession became 
singing. Veteran director Michael Curtiz helmed the musical drama, render-
ing a tightly crafted narrative in expressive black-and-white cinematography. 
Curtiz’s craftsmanship is why this film is often touted as Elvis’s best.
 
Dolores Hart, who played opposite Elvis in Loving You, co-starred as the love 
interest in King Creole. Rumors to the contrary, Hart and Elvis didn’t date 
during the production of this film. Hart, who was another of Hal Wallis’s dis-
coveries, enjoyed a successful career as an ingénue actress. Later she turned 
her back on Hollywood to become a nun. She’s currently the Prioress at the 
Benedictine Regina Laudis Abbey in Connecticut.
Elvis as Danny Fisher
King Creole may be the most far removed from Elvis’s personal life and career 
path, but it still uses the Presley iconography so fans can make the connec-
tion between Danny and Elvis. Consider the included elements:

111
 Chapter 6: Taming the Rebel: Elvis Goes to Hollywood
 
✓ Hair and sideburns: Danny’s long hair comes tumbling over his face 
in two types of scenes: when he fights and when he sings, giving his 
coiffure a dangerous and threatening connotation. When Elvis sang in 
concert, he used a certain pomade for the front of his hair to make it fall 
down in front of his eyes, which often made the girls scream.
 
✓ A taste for Cadillacs: During an argument between Danny and his father 
over Danny’s decision to sing at the King Creole nightclub, a frustrated 
Mr. Fisher asks him what it is that he wants out of life. Danny sharply 
retorts, “A pink Cadillac,” which is a reference to the legendary pink 
automobile that Elvis purchased for his mother.
 
✓ Band members: Elvis’s favorite backup vocal group — the Jordanaires — 
and his regular musicians — Scotty Moore, D.J. Fontana, Bill Black — back 
Danny at the King Creole nightclub. Again, they’re Elvis’s musicians play-
ing Danny’s musicians.
 
✓ Performing style: As expected, Danny’s performing style doesn’t differ 
at all from Elvis’s. In fact, Danny’s sensuality is alluded to comically by 
one of the strippers at the King Creole. A colorful character named Forty 
Nina complains that no one needs to come see her act anymore, imply-
ing that Danny’s onstage performance is hotter. The joke recalls the 
many times that columnists and TV reviewers compared Elvis’s act to a 
striptease or burlesque.
Using Elvis’s Movies to Spin His Image
Each of the three Elvis Presley vehicles released in 1957 and 1958 (Loving 
You, Jailhouse Rock, and King Creole) follow a similar plotline: A talented 
entertainer faces outside obstacles and inner demons on his way to show 
business success. The story is an archetypal tale in the entertainment indus-
try that’s often dubbed the show business success myth. This tale has been 
used throughout movie history.
This section explains the importance of this archetypal tale in Elvis Presley’s 
movie career, and shows how his association with it was used to reshape his 
image. The purpose was to make Elvis Presley seem less threatening, more 
familiar, and therefore more acceptable to a mainstream audience.
Explaining the success myth
The Hollywood industry embraces the show business success myth — a sub-
genre of the biographical drama or biopic — because it touts the star system 
as a fundamental part of the entertainment industry. The show business 
success story involves a talented performer who overcomes personal and 
professional obstacles to become a star embraced by audiences. Achieving 

112
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man
stardom is a personal and professional triumph. The subgenre is at least as 
old as the 1927 film The Jazz Singer starring Al Jolson and as recent as the 
2002 rap musical 8 Mile with Eminem.
This archetypal tale not only supplies the plots to Loving You, Jailhouse Rock, 
and King Creole, but after the release of these films, it could be seen as the 
paradigm to Elvis’s real-life career.
 
Because fans and audiences recognized that these three films borrowed 
extensively from Elvis’s own life in the story lines and characterizations, his 
life story became intertwined with the elements of the show business success 
myth. After these three films and the publicity and promotion surrounding 
them, it would be difficult not to see Elvis himself as the embodiment of the 
show business success story. Remarkably, these films effectively recast Elvis 
Presley’s life story and star image from that of an unrepentant, Southern-
based rebel who seemed threatening to the norms of society to a paradigm of 
the show business success myth, which was much more familiar and accept-
able to mainstream audiences. Though nothing about Elvis or his life had 
changed, the movies reshaped his image and the story of his life in an effort to 
change public perception.
Seeing the characters of Deke, Vince, 
and Danny as Elvis and vice versa
In their respective films, Deke Rivers, Vince Everett, and Danny Fisher are 
socially alienated youths who have problems with authority. They fulfill the 
roles of the rebel, strutting and stomping their way through scenes of angst 
and alienation while fighting their inner demons. The story lines eventually 
explain the sources of their discontent; in doing so, the story lines offer a 
reason for the youths’ rebellious behaviors. In other words, Deke, Vince, 
and Danny are really just misunderstood. After they deal with the underlying 
trauma of their personal issues, they’re presented as understood and, more 
importantly, accepted back into mainstream society, usually through the love 
of the leading lady.
If so much of Elvis Presley can be found in Deke, Vince, and Danny, he, too, 
must be alienated and misunderstood and, therefore, capable of redemption 
by mainstream society. By recasting Elvis’s real life into the fictional stories 
of these three characters, the films undermined the controversy over Elvis 
Presley’s hip-gyrating performing style and countered accusations that it 
leads to juvenile delinquency.
 
The controversy surrounding Elvis didn’t completely die away until he went 
into the army in 1958. (See Chapters 5 and 7 for more about the effect of army 
service on his career.) The controversy tended to heat up whenever he toured 
the country in a series of live performances, which resulted in bad publicity 
from newspapers. However, the box office success of his films, his association 

113
 Chapter 6: Taming the Rebel: Elvis Goes to Hollywood
with such Hollywood veterans as Wallis, and the positive publicity generated 
in some movie fanzines (movie-fan magazines) offered an alternative view 
of Elvis as a success story. This countered or at least complicated the effect 
of the bad publicity. The films had an impact on the depiction of Elvis in the 
press, and thus his public perception, but it’s impossible to measure the suc-
cess of the efforts to mainstream Elvis’s image.
Shaping Elvis’s music and performing style 
into Hollywood production numbers
Loving You, Jailhouse Rock, and King Creole served to redefine the music 
of Elvis Presley, or at least put it in a context that made it less threatening 
and less alien to mainstream society. The singing styles of Deke, Vince, and 
Danny are described in the films as new, modern, and targeted toward the 
kids or teenagers, but they never have the connotation of being threaten-
ing or lurid. Issues of influence and inappropriate behavior are addressed in 
Loving You, but adults eventually come to the conclusion that rock ’n’ roll 
music is simply a new sound for a new era, much like jazz or big-band music 
had been in other times.
Even more effective in handling the controversy was the way Elvis is 
depicted when performing in the films. The depiction contains or controls his 
movements. In other words, each film normalizes Elvis’s music or performing 
style, but it’s still recognizable as his. Consider how Elvis’s performances are 
depicted in each of his vehicles:
 
✓ In Loving You, Elvis is part of a country-western show; in King Creole, 
he performs in the nightclubs of Bourbon Street. Both venues would be 
familiar to adult audiences. Also, the conventional way that the musi-
cal numbers are filmed in these movies (with Elvis center frame while 
the musicians perform in the background) standardizes the presenta-
tion. Elvis gyrates, snaps his fingers, shakes all over, and moves in the 
manner to which he’s accustomed, but his mobility is limited by the 
range of the camera. The familiar venues and the limited movements 
contain his performances, making them less wild and threatening. Thus, 
he also seems less threatening.
 
✓ The title song of Jailhouse Rock offers the most interesting example of 
how producers contained Elvis’s explosive performing style. For this 
legendary production number, featuring Elvis as a jailbird dancing 
alongside his fellow inmates, his trademark moves were reworked into a 
controlled choreography, robbing them of spontaneity, unpredictability, 
and sensuality. The idea of uncontrolled sexuality was removed from his 
performance, making it suitable for a mainstream audience.

114
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man
 
 
For decades, biographers stated that choreographer Alex Romero 
allowed Elvis to choreograph the “Jailhouse Rock” number himself, but 
that’s untrue. Romero tried to teach Elvis some traditional dance steps 
and moves for the occasion, but the singer couldn’t conquer them. So, 
instead, Romero ditched the original plan and based the number’s 
moves and steps on Elvis’s established performing style.
Co-starring with some well-known actors
The producers cast recognizable adult actors and stars alongside the young 
singer in order to attract a broad range of ages to the singer’s films, which 
was typical of the era. Here are some of the costars that Elvis worked with in 
his first three vehicles:
 
✓ Loving You co-starred Hal Wallis’s discovery Lizabeth Scott as music 
manager Glenda Markle. Popular character actor Wendell Corey acted as 
the bandleader of the country-western group.
 
✓ Jailhouse Rock featured Mickey Shaughnessy as Hunk Houghton who 
teaches Vince about music and life, and Judy Tyler of The Howdy Doody 
Show played love-interest Peggy.
 
✓ King Creole featured the best cast of any of Elvis’s films, with Walter 
Matthau as gangster Maxie Fields, Carolyn Jones as the troubled Ronnie, 
Vic Morrow as local troublemaker Shark, and veteran actor Dean Jagger 
as Danny’s father.

▶ Exploring the pop sounds of Elvis’s movie music
▶ Examining Elvis’s marriage to Priscilla Beaulieu
E
lvis’s tour of duty in the army, which lasted from 1958 to 1960, marked 
the most obvious and profound turning point of his career, because it 
signaled the end of the controversy generated by his regionally tinged rock 
’n’ roll music and his provocative performing style. Elvis emerged from the 
army a confident and mature entertainer, with a new look, a changed sound, 
and a different direction for his career. This new direction led Elvis straight 
back to Hollywood, where his transformation into a smooth, pop-singing lead-
ing man was complete by the early 1960s.
Elvis devoted himself to his movie career, which successfully matured his 
image in the eyes of the public. He starred as a handsome yet conventional 
leading man in so many lighthearted musical comedies that Elvis the Pelvis 
(the nickname he earned from his sensual hip-swiveling performing style and 
notorious rock ’n’ roll image) was obliterated in the minds of the press and 
public. Also helpful was the fact that the soundtracks to these movies fea-
tured a vocally confident Elvis singing in a smooth pop-rock style that bore 
only a passing resemblance to the raw Southern-based rockabilly music that 
began his career in the 1950s.
In this chapter, I examine the steps Elvis’s management team took in order 
to reinvent him in a way that would encourage the mainstream public to 
embrace the former hip-gyrating sensation. Because much of Elvis’s new 
image was manufactured through his musical comedies, I break down the 
formula behind those vehicles, detailing each characteristic. I also mark the 

116
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man 
changes in his musical style, particularly in the soundtrack music. Finally, 
nothing matures a pop idol like marriage, and no discussion of Elvis’s matura-
tion would be complete without a consideration of his marriage to Priscilla 
Beaulieu.
Returning to Hollywood 
to Rebuild a Career
 
The folks who handled Elvis’s career, including his manager Colonel Tom 
Parker (also known as simply “the Colonel”), film producer Hal Wallis, and to 
a minor extent his William Morris agent Abe Lastfogel, capitalized on the posi-
tive publicity generated throughout the singer’s army service. Doing so suc-
cessfully disassociated Elvis from the notoriety of rock ’n’ roll. This strategy 
was a big step in constructing a new image for Elvis as a Hollywood leading 
man with broad appeal to all audiences.
The reconstruction process started with interviews and press conferences 
reiterating that Elvis served in the army without the benefit of special 
privileges. Photos of Elvis wearing his uniform flooded newspapers and 
magazines. Within a few weeks of his discharge, Elvis even co-starred in a 
television special with Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis, Jr., which aligned him 
with entertainers who epitomized mainstream show business.
Next, Wallis cast Elvis in his first post-army film, G.I. Blues, which is a musi-
cal comedy that became the prototype for the Presley movie of the 1960s. As 
with Elvis’s pre-army films (see Chapter 6), Wallis constructed a vehicle that 
not only showcased Presley’s singing talent but also referenced his real life 
as a way to shape public perception.
In this section, I detail the steps that the Colonel, Elvis, and Wallis took just 
after the singer’s discharge to take advantage of the goodwill generated over 
his army service. I show you exactly how these steps charted the course for 
the next stage of Elvis’s career.
Using the army as a turning point
Cooling of the controversy over Elvis the Pelvis actually began in 1956, when 
Presley signed a movie contract with Hal Wallis. The series of semiautobio-
graphical films he made with Wallis prior to joining the army in 1958 went 
some distance in taming Elvis’s rebellious image, but nothing changed the 
hearts and minds of his critics like serving his country. (Flip to Chapters 5 
and 6 for a complete discussion of the controversy and how his pre-army 
films helped tone it down.)

117
 Chapter 7: Reinventing His Image: Elvis Becomes the Leading Man
Back on March 24, 1958, when Elvis reported to his draft board, took his 
physical, and moved on to Fort Chaffee, the Colonel made sure photogra-
phers recorded every stage of the process. He reiterated to the press that 
Elvis was going into the regular army and wouldn’t take advantage of the 
military’s offer of serving his time in Special Services. For the next two years, 
any time Elvis was on the cover of a fanzine, he was decked out in uniform, 
reminding the public he was doing his duty for the country. (Check out the 
color photo section to see Elvis in uniform.)
On the day Elvis returned home after his tour of duty, photographers and 
reporters were on hand in both Germany, where he was stationed, and the 
United States. At the press conference at McGuire Air Force base near Fort 
Dix, New Jersey, where Elvis landed on March 2, 1960, his commanding 
officer awarded him a 3rd Armored Division Certificate of Achievement for 
faithful and efficient performance of duty. The Colonel, Nancy Sinatra, and 
executives from RCA were on hand to welcome him home as well. Nancy was 
there representing her father, Frank Sinatra, who would soon host Elvis on 
one of his television specials.
The newspapers were flooded with stories about Elvis’s return home, his 
commendations, his new sense of maturity, and his willingness to serve his 
country. Newspapers sought out comments and quotes from the men who 
served alongside him, his sergeant, and even notable celebrities. Politicians, 
columnists, and others who condemned Elvis in 1956 did an about-face, prais-
ing his patriotism, humility, and sense of duty. Elvis’s two-year stint in the 
army granted him a clean slate, wiping away his previous negative public 
opinion and replacing it with a fresh, positive perspective.
He’s in the army now
According to The Elvis Encyclopedia by Adam 
Victor, Elvis noted this about his impending 
army service in 1958: “The army can do any-
thing it wants with me. Millions of other guys 
have been drafted, and I don’t want to be differ-
ent from anyone else.” In many ways, Elvis was 
like everyone else in the army. He performed his 
regular duties in Company D of the 3rd Armored 
Tank Division, which included driving a jeep, 
went on maneuvers, and participated in war 
games just like all the other soldiers. But, his 
fame also set him apart from the other men. To 
protect his privacy, Elvis was permitted to live 
in a house with his family off base, while the 
other soldiers lived in barracks on base. This 
prevented him from bonding with the rest of his 
unit, though he did make a few close friends, 
including Joe Esposito and Charlie Hodge 
(see the appendix for more on these two men). 
Whenever he got a pass or leave, Elvis stayed 
at his house surrounded by family and friends. 
He did very little sightseeing for the same rea-
sons he didn’t go out much at home: He always 
seemed to draw an unwanted crowd. The 
exception was a trip to Paris in 1959. Because 
Elvis kept to himself, and because army service 
is repetitive by nature, not a lot of meaningful 
information is available about his army stint.

118
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man 
 
In March 1960, Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee was quoted in papers 
throughout the country as saying, “To his great credit this young American 
became just another G.I. Joe . . . I for one would like to say to him yours was a 
job well done, Soldier.”
The King meets the Voice
On March 26, 1960, Elvis taped a guest appearance on Frank Sinatra’s televi-
sion special, The Timex Special (also known as The Frank Sinatra Show, Elvis 
Is Back, and Frank Sinatra’s Welcome Home Party for Elvis). Colonel Tom 
Parker made the deal with the show’s producers months before Elvis was 
released from active duty. He thought that appearing with Sinatra would 
showcase Elvis to a wide audience made up of adults and pop-music enthusi-
asts as well as to his original fan base.
 
Never one to take chances, the Colonel made sure that during the taping at the 
Grand Ballroom at the Fontainebleau Hotel Elvis would receive an enthusiastic 
response from the studio audience. He guaranteed this response by packing in 
400 members of one of Elvis’s biggest fan clubs.
The show was subtitled “Welcome Home Elvis,” and in the opening segment, 
Elvis walked out in his army uniform. Later in the show, he performed both 
sides of his latest single: “Stuck on You” and “Fame and Fortune.” Sinatra 
then joined him onstage for a short duet. Presley sang Sinatra’s “Witchcraft,” 
while Sinatra crooned Elvis’s “Love Me Tender.”
The setup for Elvis’s segment looked very different from his last TV appear-
ances on The Ed Sullivan Show. (Head to Chapter 4 for more information 
about these appearances.) This time around:
 
✓ Elvis snapped his fingers and swayed in time to the smooth-sounding 
orchestrations, suggesting fluid movement without “gyrating” his hips.
 
✓ He performed without his guitar to strum, thump, or use as a prop.
 
✓ His look was much different. He wore a stylish, conservative tuxedo; his 
hair was shorter on the sides and back; and his sideburns were gone.
Sammy Davis, Jr., Peter Lawford, and Joey Bishop appeared on the television 
special as well as Sinatra’s daughter, Nancy. Davis, Lawford, and Bishop were 
members of Sinatra’s famed “Rat Pack,” the name given to the singer’s long-
time cronies who represented the elite of show business, especially in Las 
Vegas.
 
Elvis’s conservative clothing, short hair, subdued performing style, and 
appearance alongside the Rat Pack clearly signaled that Elvis was courting 
a mainstream, adult audience. Sinatra, known as “the Voice,” had been the 
idol of teenage girls during the 1940s. He matured to expand his audience, 
eventually becoming the biggest name in show business. Similarly, Elvis, who 

119
 Chapter 7: Reinventing His Image: Elvis Becomes the Leading Man
was called “the King,” had been the idol of teenage girls during the 1950s. 
Appearing with Sinatra suggested that Elvis was following the same career 
path and was therefore the natural heir to the Voice.
While Elvis was in the army, his original fan base also had matured, which 
perhaps helped them accept his new direction. But, most likely, they simply 
were excited to see him perform after a two-year absence from the scene.
Singing the G.I. Blues
G.I. Blues, which was released in 1960, was the third and final film under 
Elvis’s original contract with Hal Wallis. So as soon as Elvis and the Colonel 
set foot in Hollywood in the spring of 1960, Parker negotiated another three-
picture deal with the producer.
Seeing success from fans and critics alike
G.I. Blues was enormously successful; it ranked 14th in box-office receipts for 
1960. The soundtrack album, which included the rousing title song and the 
gentle ballad “Wooden Heart,” remained on the charts longer than any other 
Elvis Presley album. Film reviewers applauded the new Elvis. They were glad 
his sideburns were gone, and they thought he would find plenty of new fans 
among adult audiences.
 
Sadly, Elvis didn’t appear to share critics’ enthusiasm for G.I. Blues. He felt 
that the film had too many musical numbers, and he believed that some of the 
numbers made no sense within the plot. He also was concerned that the qual-
ity of many of these songs wasn’t as good as the music from his earlier films. 
In addition, he was eager to attempt more demanding and serious roles.
Weaving Elvis’s life into the plot
The movie’s story line revolves around singer Tulsa McLean who’s finishing 
his tour of duty in the army. Just as he had done with Loving You and King 
Creole, Wallis instructed the scriptwriters to take details from Elvis’s own life 
to flesh out the script. (See Chapter 6 for more information on Wallis and his 
strategies.) As a result, in G.I. Blues Tulsa is not only stationed in Germany, 
but he’s also a member of a tank division just as Elvis had been.
 
Using details of Elvis’s life to flesh out the character suggested to audiences 
that the character was more Elvis than Tulsa; and because fans hadn’t seen 
their idol in two years, they were eager to watch Elvis on the big screen. 
Wallis’s strategy guaranteed fan support at the box office. Also, by building 
Elvis’s recent military service into the character description, the producer 
capitalized on the positive publicity flooding the newspapers and magazines. 
Elvis had never been more popular, and he was getting massive amounts of 
free publicity; if this popularity and attention didn’t attract a wide audience to 
his movies, then Wallis couldn’t imagine what would.

120
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man 
Setting the movie apart
G.I. Blues may have been autobiographical like most of Elvis’s pre-army films, 
but it exhibited little else in common with his previous movies. Here are 
some of the differences:
 
✓ G.I. Blues is a musical comedy rather than a musical drama.
 
✓ The plot line revolves around the complications of love, with Elvis’s 
character reluctant to settle down, and the leading lady adamant about 
it. Love Me Tender aside, Elvis’s pre-army films were examples of the 
show business success tale.
 
✓ During the musical numbers, Elvis no longer gyrates in a provocative, 
sensual way. He still moves freely when he sings, but a troupe of long-
legged female dancers placed in the background does most of the hip 
swiveling.
 
✓ Elvis’s character is a mature, cool, confident ladies’ man who isn’t a 
threat to the status quo like his characters were in the pre-army films. 
He’s decidedly clean cut, with short hair and no sideburns.
 
✓ To further show that Elvis’s character offers no threat, he’s shown sing-
ing a Bavarian-style folk tune to children at a puppet show, and then he 
baby-sits an adorable infant.
 
✓ Many of the songs in G.I. Blues are fast paced, but they don’t have the 
hard-driving sound, gritty vocal delivery, and regional flavor of Elvis’s 
1950s music.
These characteristics helped mainstream Elvis by eliminating the controver-
sial elements — the music, the sensual performing style, the youthful angst, 
and even the hair and sideburns. (See Chapter 5 for a rundown of character-
istics that created the controversy surrounding Elvis.)
 
Elvis’s hair is not only short and in a conventional style in G.I. Blues; it’s also 
a different color. After Loving You was released in 1957, Elvis started to dye 
his hair jet-black, which was the color of his mother’s hair. Elvis’ natural hair 
color was dark blond or light brown, but it usually looked darker because of 
the pomade that Elvis used to slick down his flamboyant ducktail haircut. The 
two films that Elvis made after Loving You are black and white, so the change 
in his hair color wasn’t obvious. G.I. Blues and most of his other films during 
the 1960s were shot in color, and so the rich tones of Elvis’s blue-black hair 
were more noticeable. No one knows exactly why Elvis chose to change his 
hair color. Some speculate that it was because his mother dyed her hair black; 
others suggest it was inspired by one of his favorite actors, Tony Curtis.

121
 Chapter 7: Reinventing His Image: Elvis Becomes the Leading Man
Calculating a Successful Movie Formula
After G.I. Blues, Elvis appeared in two serious films for 20th Century Fox 
that challenged him as an actor — Flaming Star and Wild in the Country. 
Unfortunately, neither film matched the box-office success of G.I. Blues. The 
Colonel attributed the disappointment to their lack of songs. (See Chapter 9 
for more information about Flaming Star and Wild in the Country.)
When Elvis returned to star in his next film for Hal Wallis, the Colonel and 
Wallis were determined to make it a financial success. To that end, Wallis 
developed Blue Hawaii as another musical comedy vehicle for Elvis. This way 
he could take full advantage of Presley’s singing talent.
In this section, I examine the characteristics of Blue Hawaii that were consid-
ered instrumental in its success. These characteristics would be repeated in 
subsequent Presley films, establishing the formula for the musical comedy 
that dominated his film career. (See Chapter 9 for a thorough discussion of 
those films that didn’t follow the formula.)
Establishing the Presley formula
Wallis and the production team loaded Blue Hawaii (1961) with 14 songs — 
the most of any Presley picture. With a running time of approximately 102 
minutes, the film averages a musical interlude every 7 to 8 minutes. Wallis 
didn’t use many biographical details from Elvis’s life for this film — save for 
the fact that his character, Chad Gates, is just out of the army. Instead, he 
relied on the many musical numbers to pull in the Presley audience, which 
was beginning to expand beyond the teenage demographic.
 
Blue Hawaii provided Elvis with one of his signature songs, “Can’t Help Falling 
in Love.” During the 1970s, Elvis closed his concerts with this song — one of 
the few movie tunes that he deemed worthy of singing in concert.
Chad Gates, the son of a wealthy pineapple-plantation owner, is nothing like 
the angst-ridden working-class characters Elvis had played in his pre-army 
films. Instead, the plot involves Chad’s reluctance to trade in his Hawaiian 
shirt for a business suit. Even though he’s being pressured by his parents to 
join his father in running the plantation, Chad prefers playing music on the 
beach with his Hawaiian friends. To his parents’ dismay, he lands a dream 
job as a tour guide for the agency that his girlfriend, Maile, works for, allow-
ing him to enjoy the beautiful Hawaiian landscape and perfect weather. Maile 
hopes for something permanent with Chad, but he prefers being chased by 
female tourists of all ages.

122
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man 
Blue Hawaii was shot on location in America’s newest state, which had joined 
the union in 1959. Scenes were filmed at Waikiki Beach, Hanauma Bay, and 
Ala Moana Park. The exotic location became a principal element in the pro-
motion of the film. The tropical landscape was not only beautiful, but it also 
made the perfect backdrop for romance. Promotion for Blue Hawaii prom-
ised “Exciting Romance . . . Music in the World’s Lushest Paradise of Song!” 
Another slogan for the film was “Elvis Presley Guides You Through a Paradise 
of Song.”
 
The promotion for and publicity surrounding Blue Hawaii reduced the film to 
the following four elements:
 
✓ Music
 
✓ An exotic paradise
 
✓ Romance
 
✓ Elvis
These four elements, which were pushed in publicity and promotion, became 
the essence of the formula for the Presley vehicle.
Blue Hawaii was released during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays 
in 1961. It quickly grossed almost $5 million, and the soundtrack album was 
the fastest selling album of that year. Unfortunately for Elvis, however, the 
success of Blue Hawaii restricted him to acting in musical comedies. The 
Colonel, Wallis, and some of the execs at RCA used the tremendous box-office 
Elvis’s favorite director
Norman Taurog directed 9 of Elvis’s 31 features, 
partly because Elvis favored the veteran direc-
tor, who was good-hearted and without the ego 
often found in Hollywood. After particularly dif-
ficult scenes, the fatherly director liked to pass 
out candy bars to cast and crew.
Taurog was known primarily for directing light-
hearted star vehicles and comedies, a spe-
cialty that dated back to the silent era when 
he worked with silent comedian Larry Semon. 
He was the consummate studio craftsman, 
working with many major stars in more than 70 
films across six decades. He won an Academy 
Award in 1931 for Skippy, a vehicle for child 
star Jackie Cooper. He was nominated again in 
1938 for the Spencer Tracy classic Boys Town. 
In an oft-quoted statement, Taurog, who died 
in 1981, said of Elvis: “I was always proud of 
his work, even if I wasn’t proud of the scripts. 
I always felt he never reached his peak” (The 
Elvis Encyclopedia by Adam Victor).

123
 Chapter 7: Reinventing His Image: Elvis Becomes the Leading Man
figures to convince a disappointed Elvis that this was exactly the kind of 
movie his fan base — which had expanded to include all age groups, families, 
and fans of movie musicals — wanted to see.
 
After Blue Hawaii, Elvis made 23 more fictional features, many of which were 
financial and popular successes. Even though Elvis failed to become the seri-
ous actor that he desired to be, he did become a successful movie star for 
much of the 1960s. And, while none of his films were award contenders, sev-
eral were highly entertaining and well crafted.
Crediting Hal Wallis as the 
father of the Elvis musical
Hal Wallis’s strategy as a producer was to tailor film projects to the talents of 
his stars. He had a nose for discovering entertainers or actors who had star 
quality and then building scripts around their strengths. (See Chapter 6 for 
more information on Wallis.) From his first film with Elvis, Wallis preferred to 
develop specific vehicles exploiting his star’s singing talent and public image.
Wallis’s strategy was based on his experiences from working at Warner 
Bros. during the Golden Age of Hollywood, when stars were under exclusive 
contracts to studios that cast them according to their images and strengths. 
Later as an independent producer releasing through Paramount, Wallis 
honed this strategy to a special skill.
With his eye for talent, Wallis discovered Elvis and began making tons of 
films with him. In fact, Elvis made more films with the veteran producer 
than with any other industry executive or studio. Wallis, more than anyone, 
shaped Elvis’s film career by continually casting him in musical vehicles. 
Elvis wasn’t exclusively under contract with Wallis, so he was free to sign 
with other studios and producers as long as he fulfilled his obligations. Some 
studios and producers, such as MGM and Sam Katzman, followed Wallis’s 
lead and cast Elvis in formulaic musical comedies, while others, such as 20th 
Century Fox and United Artists, tried another strategy. (Flip to Chapter 9 for 
insight into his films for Fox and United Artists.)
 
Often, in Presley biographies and career overviews, the Colonel gets the blame 
for the formulaic musical comedies. However, that accusation is inaccurate, 
because the Colonel had little experience in the creative side of the film 
industry. He could no more develop a film vehicle than Presley’s pet chimp, 
Scatter. However, the films certainly suited the Colonel’s preference for 
fan-targeted movies jammed full of songs. Instead, the father of the Presley 
vehicle was Hal Wallis.

124

Making an Elvis film: Add these 
ingredients and stir
There’s no denying that many of Elvis Presley’s films had lots of similar- 
 ities — even those with excellent production values, good directors, and 
charming costars. According to Wallis, to make an Elvis musical comedy, 
you followed this set of characteristics:
 
✓ Exciting or stimulating jobs: Elvis’s characters always worked at pro-
fessions that most people only dream of. They were never trapped in 
the workaday world of businessmen or other professionals. They never 
went to an office and never sat behind a desk. Instead, his characters 
held stimulating jobs that allowed him to work outdoors or that were 
dangerous and adventurous. For example, he played
 
• A race car driver in Viva Las Vegas, Spinout, and Speedway
 
• A small-aircraft pilot in It Happened at the World’s Fair and 
Paradise, Hawaiian Style
 
• A boat skipper in Clambake and Girls, Girls, Girls
 
• A rodeo performer in Stay Away, Joe and Tickle Me
 
• A carnival worker in Roustabout
 
• A trapeze artist turned lifeguard in Fun in Acapulco
 
• A Navy frogman in Easy Come, Easy Go
 
• An entertainer in Harum Scarum and Girl Happy
 
✓ Lots of music: No matter what job Elvis’s character held, he could also 
sing. Presley’s characters averaged nine musical numbers per film.
 
✓ Exotic locations or well-known vacation spots: The settings for Viva, 
Las Vegas and It Happened at the World’s Fair are self-explanatory. Hawaii 
provided the setting for Blue Hawaii; Girls, Girls, Girls; and Paradise, 
Hawaiian Style. Easy Come, Easy Go and Clambake were set in Florida. 
Fun in Acapulco was set in Mexico, while Tickle Me had Elvis taking up 
refuge at a dude ranch. Double Trouble landed the singer in London and 
Antwerp. Transitory settings include the carnival backdrop of Roustabout; 
the Indian reservation in Stay Away, Joe; a turn-of-the-century riverboat in 
Frankie and Johnny; and the racing milieu of Speedway and Spinout.
 
✓ Romance: The plots of Elvis’s films continually focused on the rocky 
road of romance between his lady-killer character, who was loathe to 
settle down, and the leading lady, who had her heart set on landing Elvis.
 
✓ A touch of heart: Elvis’s characters may have been ladies’ men, but in 
each film, he sang at least one song to a child or someone’s mother to 
soften his character and prove he was good husband material under-
neath his cocky exterior.

125
 Chapter 7: Reinventing His Image: Elvis Becomes the Leading Man
 
✓ Casts of colorful characters: Elvis musicals always boasted a supporting 
cast of colorful characters. These characters, played by veteran actors, 
provided most of the comedy.
After the success of Blue Hawaii at the box office, the Colonel convinced 
Elvis that his fans didn’t want to see him as part of an ensemble cast in seri-
ous films with little music. Elvis agreed to star in the formulaic musicals, 
though he personally didn’t care for the genre. He began to derisively refer to 
them as the Presley Travelogues, because of the way his carefree characters 
drifted from one vacation locale to another.
Listing the best of the Travelogues
The Presley Travelogues never won any awards, but many of them are well-
crafted Hollywood musical comedies with good casts, colorful characters, 
and solid production values. (See Chapter 10 for a detailed discussion of the 
major directors, famous stars, and solid character actors that graced Elvis’s 
films.) Besides G.I. Blues and Blue Hawaii, which I discuss earlier in this chap-
ter, the best of the Travelogues include those in the following sections.
Viva Las Vegas (1964)
The chemistry between Ann-Margret and Elvis highlights Viva Las Vegas. This 
dynamic musical is filled with excellent songs such as the title tune by Doc 
Pomus and Mort Shuman, a well-respected rock ’n’ roll songwriting team. 
Because Ann-Margret and Elvis were famous for their moves, the production 
numbers by rock ’n’ roll choreographer David Winters accentuate dance, 
energy, and movement. You can see Elvis and Ann-Margret dancing in 
Figure 7-1.
 
Viva Las Vegas became Elvis’s highest-grossing film at the box office.

Roustabout (1964)
Legendary star Barbara Stanwyck, a good friend of Wallis, co-stars with Elvis 
in this colorful story with a carnival backdrop. Elvis plays sullen, selfish 
Charlie Rogers who finds his calling as a carny and in the process learns com-
passion, humility, and how to care about others. Stanwyck’s participation 
seemed to raise the level of acting across the board.
Girl Happy (1965)
A version of the Ft. Lauderdale Spring Break story, this film exudes the youth-
ful spirit that the Lauderdale experience thrived on. Much of the appeal is 
the cast of costars, cohorts, and comrades. Pert, affable Shelley Fabares, who 
appeared in three Presley Travelogues, exhibits a nice chemistry with Elvis. 
Similarly, Gary Crosby, Joby Baker, and Jimmy Hawkins make great comic 
sidekicks for the star.
Speedway (1968)
This race car romance lacks the spark of the other films I mention, but it co-
stars Nancy Sinatra, a long-time friend of Elvis’s. Sinatra was on a roll after a 
series of popular singles, including her signature “These Boots Are Made for 
Walking.” She gives this film a ’60s vibe that’s charming in retrospect. The mov-
ie’s highlight is the set design for the local club called the Hangout. Customers 
sit in brightly colored car bodies, which stand in for tables and chairs.
 
The set design from Speedway was undoubtedly part of the inspiration for the 
club Jack Rabbit Slim’s in Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction (1994).
Doin’ the Clam and Slicin’ Sand
David Winters, a hip, young choreographer who 
worked well with rock ’n’ roll music, designed 
the production numbers for several Elvis films. 
In 1965, the producers of Girl Happy asked him 
to invent a dance for the film. Winters came up 
with the Clam, which was introduced with the 
song “Do the Clam.” Unfortunately, the Clam 
didn’t catch on like other 1960s dance crazes 
such as the Pony, the Monkey, or the Jerk.
The Clam wasn’t the only dance to be spot-
lighted in an Elvis Presley film. The Forte Four 
sing the song “The Climb” in Viva Las Vegas, 
with Elvis, Ann-Margret, and a group of teens 
performing the dance steps (also choreo-
graphed by Winters) that went with the song. 
In Blue Hawaii, Elvis introduced a dance called 
Slicin’ Sand with a song by the same name, but 
like the Clam, the dance didn’t catch on.

 Chapter 7: Reinventing His Image: Elvis Becomes the Leading Man
Playing a Leading Man Off-Screen
By the time Blue Hawaii was cleaning up at the box office from 1961 to 1962, 
Elvis’s image had altered into the mature Hollywood leading man — handsome, 
confident, conventional looking, and part of the mainstream of show business. 
No hint existed of his pre-army image as a rebellious and misunderstood boy 
who was notorious for his controversial music and provocative performing 
style that appealed to the teenage demographic.
In this section, I talk about the off-screen Elvis Presley during the time of his 
transformation into a mature leading man. I not only analyze the Elvis that 
was presented to the press and public, but I also consider what was going on 
with Presley behind the scenes. I let you in on information that no one out-
side his inner circle knew about.
Handling the press
Constructing and maintaining Elvis’s new image required more than just 
starring in roles as older, mature characters. To show that Elvis himself had 
changed off-screen as well, the Colonel controlled the publicity and promo-
tion surrounding the personal life of his one and only client. The publicity 
departments for the studios for which Elvis made movies also generated 
press that underscored the changes.
 
This controlled publicity had been standard practice for the star system 
during the Golden Age of Hollywood when the studios had stars under long-
term contracts and deliberately guided their careers to control them. Elvis, 
who was under contract to Wallis, was experiencing the tail end of that star 
system.
 
To a large extent, the publicity and promotion that was generated for Elvis 
countered those characteristics about his image that seemed to set critics off 
during the 1950s. Much care was taken to show that the new Elvis
 
✓ Looked and dressed like other Hollywood leading men
 
✓ Was as much a man of Hollywood as he was of the South
 
✓ Was a responsible member of society
Elvis’s exposure to the media was limited to press conferences, group inter-
views, and the occasional one-on-one with journalists who had always been 
Presley friendly, such as Lloyd Shearer of Parade magazine. Luckily, Elvis 
had become media savvy since his pre-army days, when he used to blurt out 

128
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man 
comments that were then taken out of context. Now, his responses were pat 
answers to questions that reporters asked frequently. Interviews were never 
conducted at any of Elvis’s residences; instead they almost always took place 
on the sets of his movies between takes. Often the studios or the Colonel 
simply issued press releases peppered with a lot of “quotes” by Elvis, and 
these were used as the basis of articles by the media.
Dressing like a movie star
So much space was devoted to Elvis’s coiffure, sideburns, eye makeup, and 
flashy clothing from 1956 to 1958 that it must have amounted to a national 
obsession. (See Chapters 4 and 5 for a thorough account of Elvis’s personal 
appearance and how it was treated in the press.) When he returned from 
the army, it wasn’t an accident that Elvis showed up for press conferences 
and interviews in his uniform and then later in conventional street clothes. 
Reporters, columnists, reviewers, and fanzine writers duly noted the change 
in appearance.
The epitome of the publicity over Elvis’s manner of dress occurred in late 
1963 during the production of It Happened at the World’s Fair. MGM issued 
press releases detailing the extensive wardrobe of suits and sports jackets 
designed for Elvis for the movie, which were duly noted in columns and 
articles around the world: 10 suits, 4 sports coats, 30 specially designed 
shirts, 15 pairs of slacks, and 6 dozen ties. Considering that Elvis played a 
self-employed airline pilot trying to earn money to fix his plane, the wardrobe 
obviously wasn’t intended to match his on-screen character. Instead, the 
details about his wardrobe for the film highlighted the fact that he was now 
a leading man of taste and distinction. To see a photo of Elvis donning a suit 
from his new wardrobe, check out Figure 7-2.

 Chapter 7: Reinventing His Image: Elvis Becomes the Leading Man
 
The strategy to eliminate any vestiges of the old hip-swiveling kid with a 
unique wardrobe is obvious in an interview printed in Australasian Post. In the 
interview, Elvis supposedly claimed, “I could hardly believe that I had actually 
ever worn some of the gaudy shirts and sports jackets . . . They’re kid stuff. 
Fine for a schoolboy. But I’m not a schoolboy anymore. I’m 28 years old, and 
I’ve met enough well dressed people in the past few years to know that I 
looked like a hick for too long a time.” Even though the quote is attributed to 
Elvis in the article, it reeks of press-agent speak, in which writers for studio 
publicity departments provided stock interviews to fanzines and newspapers 
upon the release of each film. The movie stars were rarely involved in these 
tactics; instead, their interviews usually were ghostwritten for them.
Taking the South out of the boy
The quote that was attributed to Elvis in the Australasian Post (see the pre-
ceding section) reflects another characteristic of the post-army publicity 
campaign — subtly eliminating his Southern identity from his image.
During the 1950s, critics of Elvis’s music, performing style, and personal 
appearance often attributed his so-called lack of taste and inhibition to his 
rural Southern background, perpetuating an unflattering stereotype of the 
ignorant hillbilly. (Check out Chapter 5 for more information on the anti-
Southern prejudice against him.) However, in the studio-controlled publicity 
of the 1960s, efforts were made to “bury” his roots so deep that the public 
and the press would forget them.
With the exception of Blue Hawaii and Kissin’ Cousins, in which his charac-
ters or his family were from the South, Elvis’s film alter egos no longer hailed 
from the South after his transformation as they had in his pre-army musical 
dramas. As a matter of fact, his characters’ hometowns are rarely mentioned 
at all, because many of them are footloose wanderers who breeze into resort 
towns looking for love and adventure.
Hanging with the Memphis Mafia
The entourage of close friends, bodyguards, relatives, and employees that 
accompanied Elvis everywhere he went was dubbed the “Memphis Mafia” 
by the entertainment press during the 1960s. Traveling with his friends had 
become a habit during the 1950s when Elvis was touring, but after his dis-
charge from the service, the singer gathered his own “army” of cohorts to 
help him with daily chores, vehicle maintenance, scheduling, and security.
Most of all, however, the Memphis Mafia provided Elvis with round-the-clock 
company, entertainment, and even girls. As the years sailed by and Elvis 
grew older, having an entourage of buddies who had little ambition of their 

130
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man 
own seemed to keep the singer in a state of arrested development. Members 
of the Memphis Mafia came and went, but long-time members included Red 
West, Sonny West, Joe Esposito, George Klein, Charlie Hodge, Marty Lacker, 
Alan Fortas, and Lamar Fike. (See the appendix for more information on each 
of these individuals.)
Considering that the entourage consisted of at least a half dozen young men at 
any given time, it would have been odd if the press hadn’t noticed them. They 
accompanied Elvis to the set, on location, and to the recording studio. Most 
of the time his companions remained in the background, but the boredom of 
downtime between scenes often resulted in on-set high jinks, games, and prac-
tical jokes. Directors often resented the intrusion of the Memphis Mafia on the 
set, but nothing was ever reported in the press, because the press accepted 
Elvis’s explanation for the group’s presence — they were friends and family 
members who helped him out with the daily grind of fame and fans.
Dating his leading ladies
From the beginning of his Hollywood career, Elvis developed a reputation for 
dating his costars while a movie was in production. And if Elvis didn’t date 
his leading lady, he often found someone in the cast or behind the scenes to 
bond with romantically for the duration of the shoot. Rumors about Elvis’s 
crushes on actresses were circulated in fanzines, columns, and newspaper 
articles. Much of what was said was manufactured for its publicity value, but 
some of the rumors were true.
While on-set romances between costars aren’t unheard of in Hollywood, the 
fact that Elvis did this on virtually every film is a bit unusual. The reasons 
behind his hot pursuit of his costars can only be guessed at, but Elvis had 
always loved the girls, and they loved him back — it was part of his 
personality.
Of all his relationships with costars, his romance with Ann-Margret turned 
out to be the most serious. During the production of Viva Las Vegas, Elvis and 
the red-headed dynamo set the publicity mill grinding when they showed up 
at restaurants and clubs around Las Vegas. The romance was a dream come 
true for the MGM publicity department, who made the most of it in their pro-
motion. Even though their relationship didn’t last for the long term, the two 
remained friends for the rest of Elvis’s life.
Elvis also enjoyed the company of these beautiful and talented actresses:
 
✓ Yvonne Lime during the production of Loving You
 
✓ Anne Neyland during Jailhouse Rock
 
✓ Juliet Prowse shortly after G.I. Blues
 
✓ Tuesday Weld during Wild in the Country

131
 Chapter 7: Reinventing His Image: Elvis Becomes the Leading Man
 
✓ Joan Blackman who co-starred in both Blue Hawaii and Kid Galahad
 
✓ Yvonne Craig during Kissin’ Cousins
 
✓ Deborah Walley during Spinout
 
✓ Mary Ann Mobley who appeared in both Girl Happy and Harum Scarum
 
Donna Douglas, who enjoyed fame as Elly May Clampett on The Beverly 
Hillbillies, is one costar who didn’t have a fling with Elvis. The deeply religious 
Douglas recalled that she and Elvis spent hours on the set of Frankie and 
Johnny talking about spirituality and religion.
Trading Rock ’n’ Roll for Pop
To accompany his new image as a mainstream leading man, Elvis shifted his 
musical style from rock ’n’ roll to a pop-influenced sound. Smooth, polished, 
and refined compared to the raw rockabilly or the R&B-influenced music 
of the 1950s, Elvis’s new style was suited to the soundtrack recordings that 
dominated the 1960s. In the following sections, I offer an overview of Elvis’s 
music during his movie era.
Living in a pop-music world
Elvis’s 1960s music can be described as a rocking pop style. It was often fast 
paced and rhythmic, like rock ’n’ roll, but it was smooth, effortless, and easy 
to listen to, like pop. It wasn’t revolutionary like his 1950s rockabilly sound, 
nor was it dramatic and intense like his 1970s music.
 
Elvis changed his style of music for several reasons, including the following:
 
✓ Personal taste: Elvis liked many styles and genres of music, and he 
didn’t think it unusual to include pop and rock ’n’ roll on the same 
album. However, he didn’t think it odd to break into a gospel classic at a 
concert where his fans were expecting rock ’n’ roll either.
 
 Elvis admired several pop singers just as he admired singers in all 
genres of music. Among the pop stylists that he respected and listened 
to were Dean Martin, Mario Lanza, the Ink Spots, and Herb Alpert.
 
✓ Current trends: Because a smoother style of music made a comeback 
among new young singers during the early 1960s, Elvis’s style and song 
selection became more pop oriented. The hard-driving rhythms of 
Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Little Richard — who had become 
popular in the wake of early Elvis — were no longer as big as they had 
been. Instead, clean-cut, well-dressed male singers, such as Bobby Darin, 
Fabian, and Frankie Avalon, crooned snappy love songs or slow ballads 
in an easygoing, melodic style.

132
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man 
 
✓ Changing image: The new direction of Elvis’s music was intended to help 
audiences forget the controversy of his earlier music and hip-swiveling 
performing style and to expand his fan base to older audiences.
Recording in the studio again
Just days after his discharge from the army in March 1960, Elvis drove to the 
RCA studio in Nashville for his first recording session in almost two years. 
During the first few days of recording, Elvis cut the rock ’n’ roll tune “Stuck 
on You,” which became his first post-army single. A couple weeks later, Elvis 
returned to Nashville to record the tracks needed to make an entire album. 
By the end of April, Elvis Is Back was released. In less than two months, RCA 
had cut and pressed a new Presley album, and it was playing on the radio.
The songs selected for the album were a mix of the familiar and the new. 
They included his usual mix of rock ’n’ roll, country, and R&B tunes, but 
a few of the numbers were mellow and smooth like pop music, including 
“Fever,” which Peggy Lee had made famous two years earlier.
 
Not all the songs that Elvis recorded in April were included on the album. Two 
songs from the pop genre were held back for later release, and they became 
two of the biggest hits of his career. I discuss these songs in the following 
sections.
“Are You Lonesome Tonight?”
Al Jolson had introduced this sad ballad in the 1920s, but Elvis was probably 
more familiar with a 1959 version of the song that had been recorded by pop 
singer Jaye P. Morgan. Despite its history as a pop song, “Are You Lonesome 
Tonight?” released in November 1960, did well on the country music charts 
for Elvis. However, he wouldn’t record another song that hit the country 
charts until 1968 — a signal that his music was taking a different direction.
A unique feature of “Are You Lonesome Tonight?” is the talking bridge. Well 
into the song, Elvis stops singing and begins to speak as though he’s the 
person that the song is about. He tells the story of his broken heart and the 
girl who left him behind before launching into the final chorus. Songs with 
talking bridges were quite popular in the 1920s, when “Lonesome” was intro-
duced. And, in general, they weren’t uncommon in country-western music. 
But, talking bridges weren’t associated with rock ’n’ roll or R&B.
“It’s Now or Never”
“It’s Now or Never,” one of Elvis’s shortest pop tunes, was based on a well-
known Italian song titled “O Sole Mio,” which pop singer Tony Martin had 
recorded in 1949. Elvis liked the Martin rendition, but he wanted new lyrics 
and a new arrangement before he was willing to record it. Elvis’s version of 
the Martin tune became one of his signature songs when it was released in 
July 1960.

133
 Chapter 7: Reinventing His Image: Elvis Becomes the Leading Man
The song’s basis in “O Sole Mio” pleased Elvis because the old Italian tune 
had been associated with both Enrico Caruso and Mario Lanza, who were two 
opera singers that he admired. Lanza had died about the time that Elvis com-
missioned the new lyrics, and it’s likely that he was influenced to record the 
song because of his appreciation of Lanza.
“It’s Now or Never” was Elvis’s biggest selling single during his lifetime. 
Estimates claim that the tune sold around 30 million copies. After its long 
run as a single, the song was released on the extended-play album Elvis by 
Request in 1961.
Savoring the soundtrack tunes
Most of the films that Elvis starred in during the 1960s were musicals, and 
soundtrack albums were released for each of them. After 1964, the Colonel 
suggested that Elvis record only soundtracks. The Colonel considered Elvis’s 
movies to be promotion for the accompanying soundtrack albums, and the 
albums were reminders to fans that they should see the movies again. In 
Parker’s scheme, a film without a soundtrack, or album without an accompa-
nying film, was a wasted opportunity.
 
Elvis recorded dozens of songs for the soundtrack albums throughout the 
1960s, so they represent a considerable percentage of his musical output. 
Sheer volume aside, the soundtrack music is difficult to assess because it’s 
so erratic in quality. Doing a thorough investigation requires wading through 
a lot of mediocre and poor-quality music. However, buried among the lower-
quality songs are a surprising number of high-quality Elvis tunes from the 
1960s.
Elvis’s music is never out of style
In recent years, Elvis’s movie music was given a 
second life after several songs ended up as part 
of the soundtracks for contemporary movies. 
For example, “Devil in Disguise” became the 
closing song for a 1989 comedy called She-
Devil. And, the entire soundtrack for the 1992 
comedy Honeymoon in Vegas consisted of Elvis 
Presley tunes recorded by a variety of modern-
day singers.
Likewise, some of his movie music was 
reworked by contemporary performers, who 
updated it and gave it a different spin. “A Little 
Less Conversation” from Live a Little, Love a 
Little was remixed by a Dutch deejay act called 
Junkie XL in 2002. After the song played behind 
a Nike World Cup commercial, it was released 
as a dance-mix single. Thus, almost 25 years 
after his death, Elvis had a single in the top ten 
again.

134
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man 
For example, many of the tunes from Viva, Las Vegas are in the hard-driving 
style of his pre-army music, including “C’mon Everybody” and “What’d I Say.” 
Other excellent songs from this period include the following:
 
✓ “Return to Sender” from Girls! Girls! Girls!
 
✓ “Little Egypt” from Roustabout
 
✓ “Rubberneckin’” from Change of Habit
 
✓ “Wolf Call” from Girl Happy
 
✓ “Can’t Help Falling in Love” from Blue Hawaii
Saying goodbye to live performances
On March 25, 1961, Elvis performed live at the Bloch Arena in Pearl Harbor, 
Hawaii, as a benefit for the U.S.S. Arizona memorial fund. After this concert, 
Elvis didn’t give another live performance until 1969, and he made no tele-
vision appearances from 1960 to December 1968. Throughout most of the 
1960s, anyone who wanted to see Elvis Presley had to go to the movies.
The U.S.S. Arizona was a battleship that had been sunk on Pearl Harbor Day 
on December 7, 1941. The fund was trying to raise money to build a memorial 
to the sailors of the Arizona who had been killed in battle. Ticket prices for 
Elvis’s performance ranged from $3 to $10, with 100 ringside seats reserved 
for people who donated $100. Elvis and the Colonel bought 50 special seats 
and donated them to patients from Tripler Hospital in Hawaii. Elvis’s benefit 
raised more than $62,000 for the memorial fund. On March 30, the House of 
Representatives of the Hawaiian legislature passed special resolution #105 to 
thank Elvis and the Colonel. The memorial was completed the following year 
and officially opened on Memorial Day in 1962.
 
There’s no doubt that getting involved in the benefit for the U.S.S. Arizona 
memorial made Elvis seem more acceptable to the adult audience that 
shunned him when he was a rock ’n’ roll rebel. But his career wasn’t the 
only reason that Elvis wanted to help. He had a sensitive, generous nature, 
and throughout his entire life, Elvis gave freely to charities and other worthy 
causes, whether he received publicity for it or not.
Marrying Priscilla and Settling Down . . . 
At Least for a While
On May 1, 1967, Elvis Presley married Priscilla Beaulieu, surprising the press 
and public because so little was known about the petite brunette who had 
won the affections of the King of Rock ’n’ Roll.

135
 Chapter 7: Reinventing His Image: Elvis Becomes the Leading Man
The lack of a press profile for Priscilla is a testament to the Colonel’s talent 
for controlling the information about Elvis that was released to the media. 
Elvis had met Priscilla while he was in the army, and then she moved to 
Memphis to finish high school during the early 1960s, when she was barely 
16 years old and Elvis was in his mid-20s. Though the plan had been for her 
to live with Elvis’s father and stepmother, the truth was that she lived at 
Graceland in Memphis, where she attended a private high school. If the press 
had uncovered this information, the scandal would have destroyed the main-
stream image that the Colonel, Wallis, and Elvis had so carefully constructed.
All the stories about Elvis’s on-set romances helped deflect attention from 
the home front in Memphis, where Priscilla spent most of her time. She 
patiently waited for Elvis to return home between films, enduring the rumors 
about flings with his costars. While Elvis denied the rumors, many of them 
were based on truth. Priscilla was determined to outlast the rumors and the 
flings, because Elvis had always talked about marriage to her.
Priscilla became Elvis’s best-kept secret — she was someone outside the 
film industry who devoted her entire life to him. For Elvis, coming home to 
Priscilla was a respite from the Hollywood movies that he hated, and her 
innocence was an antidote to the scheming of Hollywood insiders. Elvis 
groomed her to be his biggest support and the woman he wanted as a wife, 
but she was never really an influence on his career or a partner in his deci-
sion making.
 
Elvis and Priscilla were married at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas and honey-
mooned in Palm Springs, California. The ceremony lasted just eight minutes, 
and only a few of Elvis’s buddy-bodyguards were asked to witness the event. 
It was a surprisingly private affair for such a public figure. (To see Elvis and 
Priscilla on their wedding day, flip to the color photo section.) On February 1, 
1968 — exactly nine months from the day they were married — the couple’s 
only child, Lisa Marie Presley, was born in Memphis.
Elvis never expressed his views about his marriage to the press or public. 
He always kept his private opinions and personal feelings about Priscilla to 
himself. However, several friends and costars recalled that Elvis was content 
and happy after his marriage. He was thinner than he had been in years and 
seemed to have settled down. The years of Elvis’s marriage (1967–1972) were 
also the years of his last extended period of creativity.

▶ Working with producer Sam Katzman
▶ Considering the worst of Elvis’s movie music
▶ Factoring in the fans
A
lthough Elvis made some dismal movies during the mid- to late-1960s, 
this stage of his career is often negatively exaggerated by biographers 
and film historians who lack an understanding of film history and production 
practices from that time period. Too often, this part of Elvis’s movie career 
unfairly overshadows his entire filmography. Some biographers and writers 
even propagate inaccuracies and misrepresentations.
In this chapter, I chronicle the decline of Elvis’s movies during the middle of 
the 1960s by discussing his manager’s handling of the movie deals and the 
effect of the low budgets on the films themselves. I also talk about the accom-
panying soundtrack albums, the reasons for their mediocre quality, why 
Elvis continued to make both low-budget vehicles and poor-quality albums, 
and the fans’ reactions. (You can read more about vehicles, or movies built 
around a star’s image, in Chapter 6.) Professionally, the films and soundtrack 
albums made money until the very end of the decade. Personally, however, 
Elvis found himself in a rut that left him depressed and alienated.

138
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man
Examining the Change in Approach 
to Making an Elvis Movie
In 1964, the moviegoing public was treated to two Presley Travelogues (the 
term Elvis coined to describe his movies; see Chapter 7) that mark a defini-
tive point in Elvis’s career — Viva Las Vegas and Kissin’ Cousins. The former 
represents the best of the Presley Travelogues, while the latter has been 
called one of the worst.
Viva Las Vegas co-stars the dynamic Ann-Margret, who at the time was about 
to break big as a major star of the 1960s. The film also benefits from location 
shooting in Las Vegas, contains some of Elvis’s best movie music, and was 
directed by a veteran of musical comedies, George Sidney. Kissin’ Cousins, on 
the other hand, lacks a dynamic female costar, was shot mainly on one set at 
California’s Big Bear Lake, and suffers from a soundtrack of mostly lackluster, 
if not ludicrous, songs.
Impressed with Viva Las Vegas, reviewers praised Ann-Margret for what she 
brought to the film and were pleased with the producers for not showcasing
 Elvis in every sequence. Viva Las Vegas made a good showing at the box 
office, grossing almost $5,000,000. Unfortunately it had cost at least half that 
amount — maybe even more, because it went over budget. Kissin’ Cousins, 
however, cost a flat $800,000, and not only was Elvis in every scene, but he 
was playing two characters (see the later section “Kissin’ Cousins” for more 
on Elvis’s dual roles in this film). The two films represented two approaches to 
the Presley Travelogues: allotting a decent budget to ensure good production 
values versus cutting costs to maximize profits no matter the consequences.
Elvis’s manager, Colonel Tom Parker (also known as “the Colonel”), assessed 
the productions of both films and decided that the better value had been 
Kissin’ Cousins. So, after that, he actively sought out multiple-film deals in 
which production costs were kept to a minimum, soundtrack costs were 
slashed, and shooting schedules were short. The king of cost cutters was 
producer Sam Katzman, who produced two of Elvis’s worst films — Kissin’ 
Cousins and Harum Scarum. You can read more about these movies in the 
later section “Introducing Sam Katzman: King of the Quickies.”
 
The Colonel’s decision to lower budgets didn’t cause a definitive clean break 
between big-scale Elvis films and low-budget ones. Luckily, Elvis was still 
under contract to people like Hal Wallis, who didn’t low-ball production values 
on the order of someone like Katzman. (Flip to Chapter 6 to read more about 
Elvis’s relationship with Wallis.) But, the Colonel’s decision resulted in several 
poorly crafted films that affected the perception of the Presley Travelogues 
as a whole. It also meant that Elvis was forced to record quickie soundtrack 
albums with dozens of mediocre songs. These albums left Elvis a forgotten 
presence in the music industry.

139
 Chapter 8: Sinking to a Low Point in Hollywood
Dealing with the Devil: Considering 
the Colonel’s New Movie Deals
Because the Colonel thrived on making deals, throughout the mid-1960s 
he complicated Elvis’s film career with an ever-expanding array of negotia-
tion ploys, promotions, and side projects. Parker spent his time, energies, 
and expertise on negotiating deals, caring little about the worthiness of the 
scripts, the level of production values, the caliber of the acting, or the quality 
of the soundtracks.
After the frustration he felt over the big budget and long shooting schedule 
of Viva Las Vegas (see the preceding section for details), the Colonel jumped 
into a frenzy of deal making that engaged Elvis in simultaneous movie con-
tracts with a variety of studios until 1968. It was an exhausting schedule 
of three films per year for Elvis, but it made him the highest-paid actor in 
Hollywood in the mid-1960s.
 
Hal Wallis’s widely quoted comment on the Colonel is only a slightly exagger-
ated one: “I’d rather try and close a deal with the Devil.”
If the devil is in the details, then in this section, I detail the Colonel’s deals, 
offering insight into the impact of his strategies on the quality of Elvis’s 
movies from the mid-1960s onward.
Let’s make a deal
The Colonel’s standard deal called for a big salary for Elvis upfront, along 
with a percentage of the profits, which generally kicked in after the film 
recouped its initial budget. The Colonel received 25 percent of Elvis’s monies. 
The cheaper the production costs, the smaller the budget, and the faster 
Elvis’s profit participation kicked in. So it’s no small wonder that Parker 
pushed for smaller budgets, faster shooting schedules, and lower produc-
tion costs. Beginning with Kissin’ Cousins, he even pursued deals with hotels, 
motels, transportation companies, and resorts to reduce production costs 
whenever Elvis’s films were shot on location.
Parker prided himself on wearing down the other party in a negotiation 
until he got what he wanted for “his boy.” One of his primary tactics was to 
negotiate improved conditions for his client at every opportunity, not just at 
the conclusion of contracts. Much to everyone’s frustration, the Colonel re-
signed new multifilm deals with Wallis and the execs at MGM before the old 
deals were close to being up, creating hard feelings among the participating 
parties. He also repeatedly asked for bonuses, clothing fees, consulting fees 
for either him or Elvis, promotion expenses, and any other costs he could 
think of. Often he was successful in obtaining these added incomes, because 
producers and studio execs grew exhausted from his constant harassment.

Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man
Parker also took charge of the films’ major promotion schemes and publicity 
campaigns, for which he used the old-fashioned carny term “exploitation.” 
He liked to boast about the many marketing ploys he came up with to bring 
in audiences. For this service, he made side deals with the studios in which 
they paid Parker an additional fee for his marketing ideas. For example, upon 
a film’s release, Parker offered fan club members free promotional merchan-
dise related to the movie to ensure their loyalty. He also suggested publicity 
stunts to major theater chains that were showing an Elvis movie, such as 
hosting dance contests to promote Viva Las Vegas. Parker was an old hand at 
luring audiences to a show. And while some of his marketing schemes were 
effective, others weren’t. He proved most effective at keeping Elvis’s fans 
loyal by offering them freebies, publicity photos, and other incentives.
Let’s make a movie — fast and cheap
Throughout the mid-1960s, Parker pushed to shorten shooting schedules, 
because shorter time frames lowered production costs and therefore bud-
gets. He even talked Hal Wallis into shaving off two weeks from the shooting 
schedules for his movies with Elvis, beginning with Roustabout in 1964.
When not working with Wallis or MGM, Parker sought out small production 
companies, because they proved more willing to offer big upfront salaries for 
Elvis while keeping the shooting schedules short.
 
The short shooting schedules, in addition to the other cost-cutting measures, 
began to cause a decline in the production values of the Presley Travelogues. 
Cost-cutting tactics caused the following negative effects:
 
✓ The acting in the movies suffered because the schedule left little time for 
rehearsal and limited time for retakes.
 
✓ Shooting on actual locations was abandoned in favor of shooting in the 
studio, on preexisting outdoor sets, and via rear-screen projection. The 
Presley Travelogues were set in exotic or unusual locales and would 
have benefited from location shooting to underscore the beauty or exot-
icism of the setting and the feeling of escapism that was central to the 
films’ sense of fun and adventure.
 
✓ Shot selection was kept to a minimum, because fewer shot setups can 
shorten the shooting schedule. However, minimum shot selection can 
adversely affect a film. Scenes are routinely divided into long shots, 
medium shots, and close-ups. The variety of shots makes the film more 
visually interesting to the viewer, directing his gaze and sustaining his 
attention. More shots also keep the pace of the film lively. Unless the 
film is in the hands of a stylish director, limiting the shot selection can 
be less stimulating for the viewer and result in lackluster pacing.
 
✓ Little time and care were spent on the soundtrack albums. In fact, the 
musicians would record the instrumentals one day and Elvis would 
record his vocals on another, depending on his mood. (Read more about

 Chapter 8: Sinking to a Low Point in Hollywood
the poor quality of the soundtrack albums in the upcoming section, 
“Considering the Movie Music.”)
Some of the Presley Travelogues suffered more than others. Those from the 
small studios without the veteran crews and talented producers fared much 
worse, including Tickle Me, Frankie and Johnny, and Clambake. The musicals 
made for Wallis, such as Roustabout, tended to exhibit bigger costars and 
higher production values. Most of the production companies and studios 
followed the formula for the Presley Travelogue until the tail end of Elvis’s 
career. (See Chapter 7 for an explanation of the formula for the Presley 
Travelogue; see Chapter 9 for more information on Elvis’s last four films, 
which don’t follow the Travelogue formula.)
Despite these conditions, Elvis’s films continued to make money at the box 
office, and the studios were still eager to make deals with “the Devil.” One of 
Parker’s most successful deals — for all parties — was with the small produc-
tion company Allied Artists for the movie Tickle Me, which was released in 
1965. Elvis was paid $750,000 upfront, which was more than half of the film’s 
budget, and he was set to receive 50 percent in profit participation. Allied 
Artists was in financial difficulties when it made the deal, but it was counting 
on Presley’s popularity to pull the company out of the red. To see Elvis in 
Tickle Me, check out Figure 8-1.

To cut costs down to the bone, the Colonel suggested that the soundtrack 
album for Tickle Me consist of no new recordings. Instead, Parker dug up 
over 20 songs that Elvis had recorded previously for other albums or occa-
sions. He asked Elvis to select 10 or 12 to be worked into the film’s script. 
Because the songs had been previously arranged and recorded, Allied Artists 
saved on the cost of recording a soundtrack. In the end, Elvis came through 
for the production company, because Tickle Me turned out to be the third 
highest-grossing film in its history.

Introducing Sam Katzman: 
King of the Quickies
In the mid-1960s, Parker signed a deal with producer Sam Katzman to make 
two films, Harum Scarum and Kissin’ Cousins. Katzman had earned the nick-
name “King of the Quickies,” because he made films quickly and for little 
money by cutting corners. During the 1950s, most of Katzman’s movies were 
low-budget rock ’n’ roll flicks aimed at teenagers. Many of them retain an 
innocent charm and are notable for starring up-and-coming actors such as 
John Savage. However, by the 1960s, Katzman’s films were a mixed bag of 
badly crafted biker movies and silly sci-fi features.
Parker and Katzman shared similar views on cutting costs to maximize 
profits. In that way, they were a match made in heaven. For tough-talking 
Katzman, the two most important factors in making a movie were keeping to 
the short schedule and staying on budget. Unfortunately, he had little talent 
for storytelling, and no interest in visual style. In this section, I describe 
Katzman’s approach to making movies, and I discuss what may arguably be 
Elvis’s two worst films.
 
Katzman once produced a film with an eight-and-a-half-day shooting schedule. 
As a point of comparison, Elvis’s film King Creole took about two months to 
shoot, which was about average during the 1950s and early 1960s.
Kissin’ Cousins
When Katzman was producing Kissin’ Cousins (1964) he gave it a meager 
15-day shooting schedule. When director Gene Nelson ran two days over 
that schedule, tensions escalated on the set between him and the producer. 
Elvis found it difficult to work under the stress, so he offered to call in sick to 
Saying goodbye to Hal Wallis
In 1967, after a ten-year relationship with Elvis, 
producer Hal Wallis opted not to renew his con-
tract with the singer. Diminishing profits and 
the Colonel’s continued harassment for more 
money and renegotiations convinced Wallis 
that the Presley pictures were no longer worth 
it. Elvis resented Wallis for saddling him with the 
Presley Travelogue, so he wasn’t sorry to leave 
the veteran producer. Plus, Elvis was irritated 
because Wallis ordered director John Rich 
to accelerate production on Easy Come, Easy 
Go (1967), relegating it to the same lackluster 
treatment as other studios were giving Elvis’s 
movies. You can read more about Hal Wallis 
and his relationship with Elvis in Chapter 6.

 Chapter 8: Sinking to a Low Point in Hollywood
give Nelson a break. The experience was nerve racking for everyone, and the 
resulting film was a wreck.
The story in Kissin’ Cousins features Elvis in a dual role — two Elvises for the 
price of one, which delighted the Colonel. His first role is as an Air Force offi-
cer who tries to persuade the Tatums, a Tennessee mountain family, to allow 
a missile base to be built on their land. He also plays the backwoods son of 
the Tatum clan. As Officer Josh Morgan, Elvis appears with black hair; as 
Jodie Tatum, he wears a dark-blonde wig, which was closer to his natural hair 
color. Refer to Figure 8-2 to see Elvis in his dual role.
 
Figure 8-2: 
Elvis played 
both Josh 
Morgan and 
Jodie Tatum 
in the 1964 
film Kissin’ 
Cousins.
 
The other characters in the film are stereotypical Southerners, including 
barefoot hillbillies, moonshiners, lazy hound dogs, man-chasing mountain 
girls, and pipe-smoking mountain mamas. Considering Elvis’s Southern heri-
tage, the story line and character depiction are downright insulting. For that 
reason, Kissin’ Cousins is often considered Elvis’s career low point.
Harum Scarum
In Harum Scarum (1965), the second Katzman-produced musical, Elvis stars 
as movie star Johnny Tyrone, who’s kidnapped while making a public appear-
ance in the Middle East. He escapes and joins a troupe of pickpockets and 
rogues, which provides ample opportunity for Elvis to sing.
Harum Scarum had an 18-day shooting schedule, but the extra time in com-
parison to Kissin’ Cousins did little to improve it. Poorly plotted, the film 
was a confusing hodgepodge of characters who all seemed to be acting in a 
different movie. Even the Colonel knew the film was a complete disaster; he 
advised MGM to release it quickly and quietly.

144
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man
 
In an attempt to “fix” the movie, the Colonel suggested to MGM that they 
record a voice-over from the perspective of a talking camel. The movie was so 
far-fetched that Parker thought a talking camel might make it seem like an 
intentional spoof. Needless to say, MGM declined the suggestion.
 
After viewing Harum Scarum, the Colonel may have realized that Katzman’s 
tactics were too extreme, because they never worked together again. The 
Colonel still pushed studios to decrease shooting schedules, but they were 
never again as short as Katzman’s.
Considering the Movie Music
The lack of care in the production of the Presley Travelogues even trickled 
down to Elvis’s soundtrack albums. During the production of the G.I. Blues 
and Blue Hawaii soundtracks in the early 1960s, Elvis had worried that the 
songs weren’t of the same quality as those he recorded in his pre-army 
movies. (See Chapter 6 for more on these soundtracks.) A couple of years 
later, he knew for sure that his soundtrack albums had deteriorated, and he 
grew bored with them.
By the time of Kissin’ Cousins in 1964, he was so disgusted with the sound-
track situation that he no longer recorded his vocals with the musicians who 
played the instrumental tracks. The musicians recorded in the studio on the 
assigned booking date, and Elvis recorded his vocals when he felt like it.
Not all of Elvis’s movie music was poor, but because he had recorded dozens 
and dozens of soundtrack tunes, the good songs are lost among the mediocre 
ones. The result is that any good music is overshadowed by the plethora of 
lackluster material. (Check out Chapter 7 for more information on the movie 
music that stands the test of time.)
 
As listening albums, the soundtracks seemed repetitive, unmemorable, and 
lackluster. However, the songs were designed to work within the context of a 
narrative movie. So they advanced the story, helped build the characters, and 
successfully expressed the emotion of a scene. In fact, within the context of 
the films, many of the songs did benefit the material.
Still, there’s no escaping the fact that Elvis recorded some forgettable songs 
during his Hollywood career. His music all but disappeared from the charts 
from 1963 to 1968. Consider the following:
 
✓ Between 1960 and 1968, Elvis didn’t score a song on the country charts.
 
✓ After 1963, his music never appeared on the R&B charts again.
 
✓ In 1965, he had only one top-ten single, “Crying in the Chapel,” which he 
had actually recorded in 1960.

145
 Chapter 8: Sinking to a Low Point in Hollywood
 
✓ In 1966, only one of his songs, “Love Letters,” made it into the top 20.
 
✓ Surprisingly, many of his albums — even the forgettable ones — made 
the top-ten album charts in the mid-1960s, but just barely. By 1967, none 
of his music charted anywhere near the top 20.
Considering the role of the songwriters
Many of the songs for Elvis’s films were written by songwriters who were 
associated with RCA’s publishing house, Hill and Range. These writers 
churned out tune after tune, with little interest in expressing themselves or 
penning original-sounding material. Plus, they were willing to give up royal-
ties to Elvis’s publishing companies set up through Hill and Range, a sure 
sign that they considered songwriting a day job, not a form of artistic expres-
sion. (See Chapter 4 for more information on Elvis’s publishing companies.) 
These writers were capable of stringing together tunes for movies, but their 
work wasn’t the same caliber as those writers who composed songs for 
Elvis’s non-soundtrack albums.
 
Even though most of the songwriters for the soundtrack albums worked 
for Hill and Range, some songwriters seemed to come out of nowhere. This 
latter group included Dolores Fuller, who penned “Rock-a-Hula Baby” for Blue 
Hawaii, “Do the Clam” for Girl Happy, and “Barefoot Ballad” for Kissin’ Cousins. 
Fuller was the girlfriend of Ed Wood, who’s a cult director of such notoriously 
bad movies as Plan 9 from Outer Space. She appeared in a couple of Wood’s 
movies before making a career change into the popular music industry.
Factoring in poor marketing practices
In addition to the lackluster material from mediocre writers, RCA didn’t 
market or package Elvis’s albums wisely. His soundtrack albums were a 
hodgepodge of songs that lacked unity and consistency. And to top it off, 
the Colonel and the execs at RCA were determined to saturate the market by 
releasing material at an extremely rapid rate. RCA often released one Presley 
soundtrack while an earlier one was still on the charts. The standard practice 
was for a performer to get as much mileage as possible from an album before 
releasing the next one.
RCA and the Colonel released the albums this way in part because they were 
soundtrack albums, which had to follow the release dates of the movies. The 
Colonel in particular preferred this strategy, because he felt the soundtrack 
album advertised the film, which in turn reminded fans to buy the album. 
How effective this strategy was in selling Elvis’s albums is open to debate.

146
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man
Focusing on the Fans
The question arises as to why Elvis’s films and albums from this era contin-
ued to make money. Clearly, some of the audience grew weary of the Presley 
Travelogues, because the later films didn’t gross on the same level as Blue 
Hawaii and Viva Las Vegas. Yet, they still made a substantial return on their 
investment.
The key to their success was the core of original fans, whom Parker courted 
with his promotional items, premiere privileges, and other gimmicks. Both 
Elvis and the Colonel held these fans in high regard and treated them with 
respect. Parker correctly estimated the power of this group of fans when he 
told a scriptwriter that a quarter of a million die-hard Elvis Presley fans were 
willing to see each movie three times. The fans believed Elvis’s charisma 
transcended any mediocre material. When the lines formed at the box office, 
the people in those lines came to see Elvis and nothing else.
Reflecting on Elvis’s Movie Career
Despite the dissatisfaction and malaise that Elvis felt by the mid-1960s, he 
continued to make movies and record soundtrack albums. He really had no 
choice in the matter, considering he was contractually obligated to continue. 
In fact, by 1964 the Colonel had Elvis tied up with film deals until 1968. (See 
Chapters 9 and 10 for information on the end of Elvis’s film career.)
Presley knew that he had lost his edge as a singer — mostly because the 
material was so dull — but no one was interested in making it more dynamic. 
After all, the albums sold well enough on their own, and the material worked 
more or less within the context of the films’ narratives. Also, the albums 
promoted the movies, and the movies served to remind people to buy the 
albums. The system worked to everyone’s financial advantage. From a busi-
ness standpoint, investing money to change the system was senseless.
 
Elvis didn’t reveal his distaste and profound dissatisfaction for his movies 
until he changed the course of his career at the end of the decade and com-
pleted his movie obligations. By that time, the movies had become less 
lucrative and a new career direction looked both creatively and financially 
promising for him. (You can read more about Elvis’s career comeback in 
Chapter 11.)

Looking Beyond the 
Presley Travelogue
In This Chapter
▶ Considering the Elvis movies that didn’t follow the Presley Travelogue formula
▶ Examining Elvis’s movies from the early ’60s
▶ Shedding light on the last films of Elvis’s Hollywood career
T
he Presley Travelogue generally gets all the attention in discussions of 
Elvis’s film career, though much of the commentary is negative. (See 
Chapter 7 for a thorough discussion of the Presley Travelogue, the nickname 
that Elvis himself bestowed on his formulaic musical comedies.) But a look 
at his complete filmography of 31 narrative features reveals that a third of 
them don’t fit the formula for the typical Presley vehicle. No consideration 
of Elvis’s Hollywood career can be complete — or accurate — without these 
films that break out of the mold.
Elvis starred in movies from a variety of genres, including musical dramas, 
westerns, melodramas, and farces, yet few Presley biographers examine 
these films at length. The glossing over of these films is perhaps because 
they complicate the standard view of Elvis’s movies as repetitive, formulaic, 
and therefore, without merit.
In this chapter, I deviate from the norm to shine a spotlight on Elvis’s non-
formulaic films, noting important details about their production, offering 
insight into their strengths, and provoking thought about their importance. 
Interestingly, these films reflect aspects of American social history, giving 
them an interest beyond Elvis’s career.
Breaking the Travelogue Mold
If the typical Presley Travelogue film can be summarized as a musical 
comedy in an exotic setting that revolves around the romance of Elvis’s 
cocky, adventure-loving character with the leading lady, then several of his 

148
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man 
films fall short of this description. His first four films released during the 
1950s don’t follow this formula, and biographers tend to treat these pre-army 
films with respect because they star the young Elvis. (Refer to Chapter 6 
for a complete discussion of Elvis’s musical dramas of the 1950s.) However, 
several films from the 1960s also deviate from the norm, yet these films are 
brushed over as anomalies, considered casualties of a squandered career, or 
simply ignored. In the following sections, I show you how these films differed 
from the standard Elvis movie.
Delving into the genres and story lines
Elvis’s non-Travelogue movies include westerns, a melodrama, satires/farces, 
a period comedy, and musical dramas. Some of these films feature serious 
themes that reflect the social issues and problems of the era, a characteristic 
generally not associated with Elvis movies. Others were based on best-selling 
novels and respectable literary sources. These latter films challenge the pre-
vailing notion that his movies were mindless.
Exploring Elvis’s roles
In these non-Travelogue films, Elvis plays characters who live in tough, hard 
worlds where they must endure and survive personal and family hardships. 
The characters aren’t carbon copies of each other, nor are they in keep-
ing with his typical role. The variety of characters he played in these films 
exhibit a broader range of emotions than the typical Presley role. This emo-
tional range pushed Elvis to stretch himself as an actor, especially early on.
Clashing over the music
As odd as it may sound, Elvis longed to star in a film in which he didn’t sing. 
To him, a non-singing role meant that he was an authentic actor, not a singer-
turned-actor. However, Elvis’s manager Colonel Tom Parker (also known 
as “the Colonel”) held the opposite view. In regard to Elvis’s films, Parker 
was completely uninterested in aesthetics, style, or selecting material that 
enhanced his client’s acting prowess.
Instead, Parker believed that fans came to see Elvis’s films in order to hear 
him sing. So, of course, Parker was adamant that songs be included. He also 
knew that the addition of songs meant a soundtrack album, which added 
more income to the coffers. When initial scripts didn’t feature production 
numbers or songs, the Colonel persuaded the studios or the producers to 
include them.

149
 Chapter 9: Looking Beyond the Presley Travelogue
 
Privately, Elvis was always disappointed when a film project was turned into a 
Presley vehicle by the inclusion of songs. However, he rarely questioned 
Parker’s decisions or authority. (Flip to Chapter 4 for a thorough discussion of 
the dynamics between Parker and Presley.) At the time, Elvis realized that his 
acting career goals didn’t match those of the Colonel or others involved in his 
films.
Considering Four Films 
from the Early ’60s
In this section, I examine four films from the early 1960s as a showcase for 
Elvis’s acting ambitions. Even though he had high expectations for himself, 
he failed to become the accomplished actor he strived to be. However, these 
films did feature themes and ideas that spoke to important issues of the era, 
giving them an added depth and significance. Elvis made four films for these 
two different studios:
 
✓ 20th Century Fox: This studio launched Elvis’s career as an actor in 
1956 with Love Me Tender. Then in 1960, the Colonel made a two-picture 
deal with Fox. Fox chose not to use Presley in the same way as producer 
Hal Wallis, who preferred to star Elvis in formulaic musical vehicles that 
exploited his existing image and popular singing style. (See Chapters 6 
and 7 for a thorough examination of Wallis’s strategy regarding Elvis’s 
film career and his role as the “author” of the Presley Travelogue.) 
Instead, the folks at Fox cast Elvis in serious roles in dramatic films 
based on acclaimed novels. They placed him in an ensemble cast of 
several strong leading actors and venerable character actors, who were 
handled by renowned directors and veteran producers.
 
✓ United Artists: In 1962, Elvis signed a two-picture deal with the Mirisch 
brothers, who were producers with their own independent production 
company that released through United Artists. For the Mirisches, Elvis 
starred in Follow That Dream and Kid Galahad, which were both released 
in 1962. The Mirisches didn’t strategize on the same level as 20th 
Century Fox, but like Fox, they didn’t follow the formula for the Presley 
Travelogue.
 
The average Presley Travelogue featured about a dozen songs, while 20th 
Century Fox had minimized the number of songs to two for Flaming Star 
and four for Wild in the Country. United Artists, on the other hand, offered a 
compromise at six for Follow That Dream and six for Kid Galahad, which was 
enough to satisfy the Colonel.
In the following sections, I discuss each of Elvis’s four early films with Fox 
and United Artists, including plot details, differences between these films and 
the Travelogues, and a bit about what went on behind the scenes.

Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man 
Shooting a western: Flaming Star
Flaming Star, which was released in December 1960 by 20th Century Fox, gave 
Elvis the chance to prove himself as a serious actor. In this tragic western, 
Elvis plays Pacer Burton, the young son of a white settler and a Kiowa Indian. 
A Kiowa uprising forces Pacer to choose sides between the white settlers and 
his mother’s people. The character endures prejudice, feels his first pangs of 
love, and suffers an identity crisis — a set of events that represented a broad 
range of emotions for Elvis to play. See Figure 9-1 for a look at Elvis in this role.
 
Figure 9-1: 
Elvis worked 
hard to be 
a serious 
actor in 
Flaming Star 
(1960).
 
Flaming Star touts a socially progressive story line that depicts the prejudice 
Pacer experiences because of his half-caste status. The plot may take place in 
the Old West of the 1870s, but the theme was relevant to race relations in the 
1960s as well. The important story line certainly elevates the significance of 
Flaming Star.
Feeling the pressure on the set
Unfortunately, Elvis’s efforts to give a dynamic performance in Flaming Star 
fell short. A sense of unease developed between Elvis and director Don 
Siegel. Siegel wasn’t thrilled that producer David Weisbart had hired Presley, 
but he accepted the situation. However, Elvis still felt the director’s dis-
approval on the set.
Later, Siegel claimed that the singer’s entourage of friends, assistants, and 
bodyguards were constantly on set. Elvis and his gang practiced karate, 
played touch football, and chased girls, and the director thought it inter-
fered with communication between him and Elvis. The tension undoubtedly 
affected Elvis’s performance, which was superficial and erratic compared to 
the other actors in the ensemble. He lacked control over his line delivery, 

151
 Chapter 9: Looking Beyond the Presley Travelogue
especially during emotional scenes when he tended to blurt out his dialogue 
too rapidly.
 
Elvis sang two songs in Flaming Star: the title song and “A Cane and a High-
Starched Collar.” A four-song print had been shown to a preview audience, 
but it was never released. Siegel may have thought that so many songs would 
detract from the movie’s serious tone. Siegel may have been correct from 
an artistic point of view. After all, the movie received lots of good reviews. 
However, it was a box-office disappointment compared to G.I. Blues, and the 
Colonel blamed it on the lack of songs.
Recognizing the strength of the cast
 
Despite any shortcomings in Elvis’s performance, Flaming Star remains a well-
crafted, highly watchable western. Its success is due to the efforts of the cast 
and crew. Consider some of the high-profile industry personnel Fox gathered 
to produce the film:
 
✓ The ensemble included veteran character actor John McIntire, legendary 
Mexican movie star Dolores Del Rio, and respected actors Steve Forrest, 
Barbara Eden, and Richard Jaeckel. The advantage of an ensemble cast 
is that solid performances by the whole can balance the weaknesses of 
the individuals.
 
✓ Director Siegel, who later won critical acclaim for the original Dirty 
Harry, was a master of tightly directed action scenes, and his skills are 
evident in Flaming Star.
 
✓ The script was based on a popular novel by Clair Huffaker. Nunnally 
Johnson, a long-time Hollywood producer and screenwriter famous for 
scripting The Grapes of Wrath, cowrote the film with Huffaker.
 
✓ Established composer Cyril Mockridge produced the background music.
Milking the melodrama: 
Wild in the Country
After Flaming Star, Elvis got another chance at serious acting in Wild in the 
Country, which was released in 1961 by 20th Century Fox. In this Southern 
melodrama, he stars as a young hothead named Glenn Tyler, whose anger 
and frustration are the result of his underprivileged background. After serving 
time in a juvenile hall, he’s put under the care of a female psychiatrist, played 
by Hope Lange, who wants him to try college and become a writer. Two other 
women, played by Tuesday Weld and Millie Perkins, also play important roles 
in Glenn’s life. He evolves from sullen to sensitive as the story line progresses, 
giving Elvis an opportunity to stretch himself as an actor. Elvis’s performance 
is better in this film than in Flaming Star, and he exhibited some undeniable 
chemistry with spitfire Tuesday Weld, but he still has problems with rushing 
his line delivery and building a character with depth.

152
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man 
Wild in the Country, which was scripted by the legendary left-wing playwright 
Clifford Odets and directed by socially conscious scriptwriter Philip Dunne, 
exhibits a class consciousness that points out the disparities between the 
advantaged middle classes and the permanent underprivileged. Glenn’s lack 
of opportunities, such as access to college, are presented as the reason for 
his violent tendencies; likewise, the lack of opportunity and class prejudice 
that Tuesday Weld’s character experiences result in her promiscuous behav-
ior. The characters embody progressive liberal ideas on poverty, class, and 
crime. The effort of Odets and Dunne to imbue a conventional melodrama 
with important themes makes this film a respectable addition to Elvis’s 
filmography.
No songs were included in the original script for Wild in the Country, but 
when Flaming Star didn’t perform to expectations at the box office, six musi-
cal numbers were added. Four made the final cut, including the title song, 
“I Slipped, I Stumbled, and I Fell,” “In My Way,” and “Husky Dusky Day.” The 
film still failed to meet box-office expectations, and the Colonel again blamed 
the lack of songs. But his assessment wasn’t necessarily accurate.
Tackling satire: Follow That Dream
Elvis gives one of his most successful performances as Toby Kwimper in the 
lighthearted social satire Follow That Dream, which was released in 1962 by 
United Artists. In the film, Toby and his backwoods family claim squatters’ 
rights on an empty stretch of beach in sunny Florida, and then build a home-
stead there out of salvaged materials, much to the chagrin of local officials. 
Stuffy bureaucrats try to get rid of the honest, down-home Kwimpers, who 
don’t care for the complexities of the modern world but whose approach to 
life is the essence of true family values.
On the surface Toby appears to be a dumb rube, because he speaks with 
an accent, displays no interest in material things, and sees the world in a 
simple way. A lustful female psychiatrist and two shady gamblers try to take 
advantage of Toby, but he foils them. Elvis’s layered performance as Toby 
required him to portray a character who the people in the film believe to be 
simple and incapable, but who audiences know to be clever and resourceful, 
without altering the nature of the performance. The rube who isn’t as dumb 
as sophisticated urban dwellers believe him to be is a staple character in 
Southern culture. So, because of his own Southern roots, Elvis undoubtedly 
understood the nature of this character. Elvis also exhibited a flair for real 
character comedy in this film, a talent he would rarely have the opportunity 
to showcase again.
Follow That Dream featured a half-dozen songs. Most of them were service-
able tunes in that they fleshed out the characters or plot, but the title song 
was above average. Like most well-made musical comedies, the solid cast of 

153
 Chapter 9: Looking Beyond the Presley Travelogue
character actors added a lot of fun and charm to the film. Comedy veterans 
Arthur O’Connell, who played the head of the Kwimper clan, and Roland 
Winters, who played the judge, were particularly effective.
 
As based on the acclaimed novel Pioneer, Go Home by Richard Powell, Follow 
That Dream is a clever satire on the frustrations of our fast-paced, modern 
society, whose members have forgotten the simple pleasures of life.
Making a musical drama: Kid Galahad
Kid Galahad, a remake of a Depression-era Warner Bros. film, tells the story 
of a naive boxer, played by Elvis, who’s manipulated by a hungry manager 
eager to make the big time. The original film from 1937 benefited from the 
gritty, low-budget Warner Bros. style, but this United Artist remake produced 
by the Mirisch Brothers in 1962 lacks an effective visual style to re-create a 
boxing milieu.
In this film, Elvis holds his own in a cast that includes such noteworthy stars 
as Gig Young, Charles Bronson, Ed Asner, and Lola Albright. Perhaps he was 
improving as an actor through the experience of working in several films of 
different genres, or maybe he simply was more relaxed on the United Artists 
sets than on the Fox sets, where expectations were greater and the directors 
more demanding.
The film featured conventional movie-musical songs, but they didn’t help the 
film at the box office. The film made a respectable $2 million upon its initial 
release, but it paled in comparison to Blue Hawaii.
Factoring in the Final Films
Elvis’s last four movies differed from the formulaic Presley Travelogue, but 
they were produced from 1967 to 1968, a period of transition for the singer. 
During this time, Elvis had become completely disillusioned with Hollywood, 
and he was in the process of making some important career changes. He 
didn’t seem to care that he had finally broken free of the Travelogue formula, 
and he also didn’t use these roles to turn around his film career.
From all accounts, Elvis simply wanted to finish his existing film contracts 
and get them out of the way. By the time his last film, Change of Habit, was in 
production, Elvis was experiencing a comeback to the music scene, and his 
talents and creative focus were directed toward honing a new musical style 
and returning to live performances. (See Chapter 11 for a full discussion of 

154
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man 
Elvis’s comeback to musical prominence.) Despite his musical comeback, 
the tunes in these films don’t reflect the new direction of his music. With a 
couple of notable exceptions, the songs remain standard movie-musical fare.
 
Elvis’s last four films, made for a variety of studios and producers, recouped 
their investment money at the box office. However, even though they didn’t 
flop, they made very little over their investment costs. In the eyes of the 
Colonel and some of Elvis’s contracting studios, this meager return signaled 
an end to his success in the movies. Studios and producers who had worked 
with Elvis for years, including MGM and Hal Wallis, didn’t renegotiate con-
tracts after 1967.
In dealing with these final films, biographers, music historians, and other 
writers take their cue from Elvis’s lack of interest. Most of them barely men-
tion the last four films, often erroneously grouping them with the typical 
Presley Travelogues. Like Elvis, they were in a hurry to move on to another 
chapter of his life and didn’t take these films seriously. The films lack the 
craftsmanship and production values of the movies mentioned earlier in the 
chapter, but they represent an aspect of Presley’s film career that deserves 
consideration.
 
The key difference between Elvis’s later films and his earlier musical comedies 
is the attempt to adapt to changing times both in the film industry and in the 
country in general. A criticism aimed at Elvis’s Hollywood is how old fash-
ioned the films had become by the late 1960s. However, in sweeping his later 
films under the rug, biographers and historians ignore the ways in which his 
movies actually did reflect the changing times.
In the following sections, besides discussing how these films differ from 
the Travelogue formula, I also focus on the way Elvis’s last films reflect 
the changing times in Hollywood and across the country. I put them in the 
context of the times to point out some interesting qualities and surprising 
strengths. As you read through the sections, consider the following topics:
 
✓ Sex: Despite the romance that was part and parcel of the Presley 
Travelogues, Elvis’s characters did little more than kiss the leading 
ladies. By the late 1960s, however, attitudes toward the depiction of 
romance and sex on the big screen had loosened. Surprisingly, Elvis’s 
film Live a Little, Love a Little wrestles with the new attitudes toward 
sexual mores, making this film more adult in tone.
 
✓ Violence: The loosening of censorship guidelines in the industry made 
graphic violence more common in the new Hollywood, a factor that 
becomes relevant to Elvis’s western Charro!
 
✓ Politics: The politics and social consciousness of the 1960s made an 
impact on the story lines of Change of Habit and The Trouble with Girls. 
Both films include scenes dealing with prejudice, and the former draws 
attention to the poverty and lack of opportunity in the nation’s inner 
cities.

155
 Chapter 9: Looking Beyond the Presley Travelogue
Sleeping with the girl (finally): 
Live a Little, Love a Little
Live a Little, Love a Little, released in 1968, became the first Presley film to 
include premarital sex. In the story line, Elvis’s character Greg Nolan, a slick 
photographer who works for a Playboy-type magazine called Classic Cat, has 
an accident on the beach and recuperates in the beach house of a kooky ’60s 
girl. In the course of their unconventional relationship, they share a night 
of passion, even though the audience doesn’t actually see it. In addition to 
really getting the girl, Greg enjoys another 1960s-style episode when he expe-
riences a psychedelic dream sequence complete with go-go dancers and a 
man dressed in a dog suit.
An offbeat comedy about sex and romance, Live a Little, Love a Little exhibits 
a screwball quality that’s refreshingly hip compared to the formulaic Presley 
Travelogues. Despite its refreshing quality, however, the film’s characteriza-
tion and plotting are weak. The movie didn’t fare well at the box office, and 
the studio felt it too lackluster for a release in the United Kingdom, despite 
Elvis’s fan base there.
 
Considering that Elvis’s films were targeted to fans, who were now older, and 
marketed to mainstream audiences, including families, the addition of pre-
marital sex and nonconformist characters reflect how tastes and social stan-
dards loosened during the course of the swinging ’60s. The film also reveals 
the industry’s attempt to reinvent familiar genres — like the romantic 
comedy — to stay relevant to the times.
Only four songs made up the soundtrack to this film. Of those, “A Little Less 
Conversation” proved to be the best, though at the time, it was cast aside 
with the other tunes. It wasn’t released until 1973 when it appeared on the 
album Almost in Love. However, the lively tune was remixed and revised in 
2002, when it topped the charts in the United Kingdom. It was released on the 
2002 hit compilation ELV1S 30 #1 Hits.
Reminiscing with a period piece: 
The Trouble with Girls
Elvis’s 1969 period comedy The Trouble with Girls exhibits no signs of updat-
ing the material with contemporary themes, even though it was released by 
MGM, the same studio that produced Live a Little, Love a Little. (Refer to the 
preceding section, “Sleeping with the girl (finally): Live a Little, Love a Little,” 
for more on this movie.)

156
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man 
In The Trouble with Girls, Elvis stars as Walter Hale, the manager of a 1920s 
Chautauqua, which was a traveling tent show that provided education as 
well as entertainment. Walter is relatively new to his job, and he’s trying to 
prove himself with the former manager. Sometimes he reverts to less-than-
scrupulous methods, but he leads the show to great success in the end. 
The film offered a slice of Americana from the past. A few of the subplots 
didn’t involve Elvis, so he wasn’t the focus of every scene. The period setting 
and the reduction in screen time for Elvis’s character weren’t typical of his 
movies. By this time, Elvis’s films weren’t performing to anyone’s expecta-
tions; in the case of Trouble, the Colonel was reluctant to gather and report 
the box-office statistics.
Six songs were included to round out the story line, but none of them are 
memorable. Indeed, a couple of them represent low points even for the 
soundtrack recordings, including “The Whiffenpoof Song.”
Breaking into the Italian 
western genre: Charro!
In 1969, Elvis finally starred in a film in which his character didn’t sing even 
one song — the western Charro! Elvis crooned the title song over the credits, 
but his character, Jess Wade, never once broke into tuneful reverie. Elvis had 
longed for a role that pushed his musician side to the background for some 
time. Unfortunately, it was too late, and he was no longer interested in his 
film career.
The script for Charro! indicated that this gritty western was to be in the mold 
of Clint Eastwood’s Italian westerns, which were enormously popular in the 
late 1960s. Italian westerns featured violent, scruffy-looking cowboys who 
frequently double-crossed each other. Even the good guys weren’t heroic in 
the traditional sense. Presley’s character, Jess Wade, is a former bad guy who 
comes up against his old gang, which is terrorizing a small Mexican town. 
Jess uses a lot of gun powder and violence to stop them.
At first, Elvis expressed enthusiasm for this film, because the original script 
kept closely to the explicit sex and graphic violence associated with the 
Italian western. To Elvis, this signified that the film was targeted to a serious 
adult audience. Unfortunately, by the time he showed up on the set, the vio-
lent gunfights and seedy brothel scenes had been toned down considerably 
and replaced by conventional barroom brawls and unhappy saloon girls. 
In addition to the watered-down script, the film’s director, Charles Marquis 
Warren, lacked the talent or insight to effectively re-create the unique style 
of the Italian western. Disillusioned once again, Elvis went through the paces, 
anxious to get the film over with.

157
 Chapter 9: Looking Beyond the Presley Travelogue
The budget for Charro! was $1.5 million, and the film made little profit. The 
Colonel no longer kept or released statistics, perhaps because the films 
weren’t doing as well, or perhaps because both Elvis and the Colonel’s inter-
ests lay elsewhere.
 
Composer Hugo Montenegro, who had done the music for some Italian west-
erns, wrote and arranged the background music for Charro!
Getting dramatic: Change of Habit
In his final big-screen appearance, Elvis starred as Dr. John Carpenter, a 
doctor who practices in an inner-city slum. A social drama with a strong cast, 
Change of Habit (1969) co-stars Mary Tyler Moore as one of three nurses who 
are sent to help the inner-city doctor. However, Elvis’s character doesn’t 
realize that these nurses are also nuns, and he falls in love with Moore’s 
character. The story was very loosely based on the real life of a nun who had 
worked with children who had speech handicaps.
The film would have benefited from being shot on location in an inner-city 
neighborhood, because the Universal back lot where it was shot looks artifi-
cial and less than authentic. Also, the idealistic resolution the film offers to 
deep-seated social issues is trite. Nonetheless, the events in the story line 
reflect the social turmoil and violent trauma that major cities were facing in 
the late 1960s, including the inequalities of healthcare in the ghettos, the dis-
enfranchisement of minorities, and the breakdown of and need for a change 
in social institutions, such as law and order and the church.
The director of Change of Habit, a young man named Billy Graham, used 
improvisations and other acting exercises to help his actors understand the 
motivations of their characters. These tactics became common and accepted 
among a new generation of directors and actors. Elvis would have benefited 
from them earlier in his career. According to Graham, Elvis did very well in 
these exercises when he was interested, but he wasn’t always willing to make 
the effort. His lack of interest was perhaps due to his disillusionment with 
Hollywood.
Only four songs were used in the film. One of them, “Rubberneckin’” is a 
decent pop-rock tune, which was recorded in Memphis at American Sound 
Studio during Elvis’s sessions with talented producer Chips Moman. (See 
Chapter 11 for more on these sessions.)
 
Change of Habit was probably the kind of film Elvis would have preferred 
to star in for most of his acting career, but never had the opportunity. 
Unfortunately, it was too little, too late. By the time Change of Habit went into 
production, Elvis had decided against acting in any more films.

Chapter 10
Defending Elvis’s Movies: 
They’re Not That Bad
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the criticism of Elvis’s movies
▶ Taking a look at the teen musical
▶ Seeing Elvis’s career as a model that other singers followed
F
inding value, entertainment, and meaning in Elvis’s movies is definitely 
the minority viewpoint. A look at many of the Presley biographies, 
memoirs, and career overviews reveals that the prevailing opinion of Elvis’s 
movies is a negative one. The low opinion began with Elvis himself, who 
became so disillusioned with the direction that his film career took that he 
eventually dismissed his entire Hollywood experience. (Glance at Chapter 8 
for more on Elvis’s perspective on his movies.) The viewpoint was continued 
by biographers who looked down on his film career because it changed Elvis 
from a notorious rock ’n’ roller to a conventional movie star, making him less 
exciting and less innovative in their eyes.
However, the reasoning behind the prevailing view doesn’t really hold up 
under close scrutiny. Elvis had personal reasons for turning his back on his 
movies, so he didn’t see them in an objective light. And, those writers who 
criticize Elvis’s movies often fail to put his Hollywood career in context of the 
film industry. When considered in context, Elvis’s movies actually fit neatly 
into a kind of musical comedy that, at the time, was popular with youth 
audiences and lucrative at the box office. In these films, young pop singers, 
like Elvis, were tapped to star in lighthearted romantic tales with themes, 
plotlines, character types, and music relevant to a new generation but still 
appealing to a wide range of ages. As a matter of fact, Elvis’s contributions to 
this subgenre were better crafted and acted than most.
Not only were Elvis’s films in this subgenre financially successful, but they 
also turned the singer into a movie star, which meant he was accepted and 
popular with the mainstream audiences in a way he certainly hadn’t been in 
the 1950s. Falling into mainstream popularity was his management team’s 

160
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man 
objective from the beginning. Elvis’s career path from controversial rock ’n’ 
roller popular with a niche audience to successful pop-singing movie star 
accepted by the mainstream serves as a model for contemporary hip-hop, 
rap, and other performers hoping for a lengthy career in show business.
In this chapter, I explain the shortcomings of the common critical perception 
of Elvis’s film career and explain why it has become the prevailing view. I also 
offer an alternative understanding of the movies based on the subgenre to 
which they belong. In addition, I talk about the movie music in relation to its 
specific purpose within the films, which allows you to appreciate it or at least 
tolerate it. I round out this chapter by comparing Elvis’s career path to those 
of contemporary stars seeking mainstream acceptance.
Understanding Why the Movies 
Need to Be Defended
Elvis’s Hollywood career needs a solid defense, because few writers have 
ever considered it within the context of the period or within the frame-
work of the film industry. Therefore, few have discussed it with authority. 
Biographers, music historians, and others who criticize Elvis’s movies tend 
to consider the films in retrospect of his entire career.
 
In comparing his movie-era work to the innovative sound and cultural sig-
nificance of his 1950s music, the sweet pop sound and clean-cut image don’t 
measure up. From the perspective of these writers, Hollywood robbed Elvis of 
everything that was unique about his music and performing style. This view 
not only taints their discussion of the movies but also results in a narrow dis-
course on this entire phase of his career. And, many writers use the fact that 
Elvis saw his film career as a failure as further validation of their low opinion.
In this section, I tell you about Elvis’s disappointment in his career and the 
initial criticism of his films. I also tell you why this criticism is misplaced.
Factoring in Elvis’s dissatisfaction
Elvis himself made fun of his movies in his later life, and he often remarked 
bitterly that he was disillusioned with his film career. Because Elvis thought 
his tenure in Hollywood was a disappointment, it was easy for everyone else 
to pick up on his cues and declare his film career a failure. To set the record 
straight, I reflect here on some of the reasons behind Elvis’s dissatisfaction 
with his Hollywood career.

161
 Chapter 10: Defending Elvis’s Movies: They’re Not That Bad
 
In the August 11, 1969, issue of Newsweek magazine, Elvis announced that his 
film career was over, remarking, “I got tired of playing a guy who gets into a 
fight, then starts singing to the guy he’s just beat up.” This declaration is often 
quoted in biographies and career overviews to “prove” that Elvis’s film career 
wasted his talents. After all, even he found his movies to be ridiculous.
Part of Elvis’s opinion was based on his profound dislike of the musical 
comedy genre. He didn’t like the type of movie in which the characters ran-
domly burst into song, because he felt it was unrealistic. This type of musical 
is clearly an acquired taste. Some viewers can suspend disbelief and accept 
this fanciful convention of the genre; others can’t. Elvis fell into the latter 
camp, and unfortunately, the musical comedy was the type of movie he was 
most associated with.
 
However, the main reason for his resentment was his failure to be taken seri-
ously as an actor. From his first weeks in Hollywood, Elvis dreamed of becom-
ing a serious actor in dramatic roles, but these desires didn’t pan out. He grew 
more bitter and disappointed with each movie he made. (See Chapters 6 for a 
complete understanding of Elvis’s goals in his film career.) His suspicions that 
his movie career wouldn’t pan out like he had dreamed turned into a bitter 
realization with a specific incident involving film producer Hal Wallis.
Here’s what happened: In April 1964, during the last days of shooting on 
Elvis’s film Roustabout (1964), a story appeared in the entertainment press 
regarding Wallis’s upcoming film Becket (1964), starring two of the most 
respected actors of the time, Peter O’Toole and Richard Burton. The article 
described how Wallis financed Becket based on the projected revenue for 
Roustabout, because Wallis’s Presley features always made money. The 
article was condescending toward Elvis’s movies, suggesting how ironic it 
was that such a prestigious film starring “two brilliant Shakespearean-trained 
actors” was dependent on “Sir Swivel Hips.” Becket went on to win acclaim 
and an Academy Award for best adapted screenplay, while Roustabout was 
treated as just another fluffy musical comedy.
This article made Elvis realize that Wallis was never going to star him in a 
film of the caliber of Becket. He discovered that the producer’s plan was to 
make money from his musical comedies in order to finance the kind of film 
that Elvis had always wanted to act in. Elvis felt used — and then eventually 
used up.
 
In an oft-quoted statement, Wallis once declared, “A Presley picture is the only 
sure thing in Hollywood.”

162
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man 
Examining the standard view 
of Elvis’s movies
As soon as Elvis’s last Hollywood feature film was released in 1969, the singer 
felt free to express his poor opinion of his movie career. In public, his criti-
cism took the form of the occasional joke about the lightweight nature of 
his movies, but in private conversations, his view was considerably more 
bitter. After Elvis died, biographers took up his negative viewpoint and even 
expanded on it. Unfortunately, the biographers tended to be music critics 
or historians, which colored their perspectives and didn’t prepare them for 
understanding how the film industry worked.
 
Two main criticisms of Elvis’s movie career emerged from the first wave 
of biographies published after his death, and these two ideas have been 
repeated by subsequent authors until they have become clichés. The first 
criticism maintains that Elvis could have been a successful serious actor if he 
hadn’t been tied down by the formulaic musical comedies. The other criticism 
blames the movies for a “decline” in his music as he changed from rock ’n’ roll 
to the softer pop-rock sound of the movie soundtracks. Upon examination, 
neither of these critical assumptions is an accurate assessment of what hap-
pened with Elvis’s movie career.
In this section, I take a general look at the first Elvis biographers and why 
their specific backgrounds and expertise colored their interpretations of 
Presley’s film career. Then I examine their criticisms, looking at them from a 
film history perspective, to point out their shortcomings.
Considering the biographers
Throughout most of his career, Elvis’s manager Colonel Tom Parker (also 
often referred to as simply “the Colonel”) controlled the access to his client 
by the media or other writers. Subsequently, Elvis left behind no definitive 
interview or lengthy discussion in which he defended, analyzed, or explained 
his music or career choices. So after his death, biographers depended on sec-
ondary sources, such as friends, associates, and family members, for infor-
mation on the private Elvis. Some of these interviewees had faulty memories, 
and some had their own agendas, making their remembrances suspect. Also, 
these biographers were freer to speculate about the Colonel’s handling of 
Elvis’s career, because neither Elvis nor Parker was on record explaining 
their strategies and opinions in detail.
The first serious writers to put Elvis’s career and contributions into any 
kind of cultural perspective after the singer died were rock-music historians, 
including Dave Marsh and Greil Marcus. These two writers had honed their 
craft and perspective as writers for Rolling Stone magazine, and it showed in 
their assessment of Presley’s Hollywood career. Their views were critical 
and derisive, because the movies had spelled the end of Elvis the notorious 
rock ’n’ roller. And, of course, that was the part of Elvis’s career these 

163
 Chapter 10: Defending Elvis’s Movies: They’re Not That Bad
writers were most interested in. They also believed that Elvis’s movie career 
weakened his musical output during the 1960s by forcing him to record softer 
pop-influenced material, so they disliked most — if not all — of the movie 
music. Other biographers who approached Elvis’s life from a music perspec-
tive wrote similarly of his Hollywood career. The formulaic nature of movie 
vehicles added to the criticism heaped on the films by biographers who were 
rock ’n’ roll reviewers or music historians.
Though wonderful writers and perceptive music critics, writers like Marsh 
and Marcus lacked insight into the history and inner workings of Hollywood, 
making their opinions about Elvis’s movies just that — opinion. Instead of 
understanding the Presley Travelogues as musical vehicles deliberately 
constructed by Wallis to show off Elvis’s premiere talent — singing — they 
tended to simplistically blame the Colonel for exploiting Presley and squan-
dering his talents. Later writers simply repeated the perspective of these first 
serious biographers, propagating the criticism of the Hollywood movies and 
their music. However, these critics tended to praise those pre-army movies in 
which a hard-rockin’ Elvis sang and looked like . . . well, a hard-rockin’ Elvis.
 
These biographers and music historians tend to regard Elvis’s films in isola-
tion, without relating them to other movies that were popular at the time or to 
the era that produced them. Like all popular arts, movies reflect the times that 
produce them, and they’re subject to a variety of influences that surround 
them. To consider Elvis’s films without a discussion of the era, the influences, 
or the industry is to leave out much of the story. (Flip to the later section 
“Appreciating Elvis’s Movies As Part of the Teen Musical Subgenre” for more 
information on how to best compare Elvis’s movies to those produced during 
the same time period.)
Disputing the claim that Elvis should have been a serious actor
One of the oft-repeated criticisms about Elvis’s movie career claims that he 
could have been a serious actor if only he had been allowed to appear in big-
budget, high-profile projects. But, there’s no guarantee that he would have 
been successful. Throughout the history of Hollywood, scores of performers 
from other arenas of entertainment have attempted serious acting careers, 
and many of them have been successful. But, some have experienced only 
limited success in movies. Some even failed completely.
During the 1960s, the film industry was in a period of transition and more 
unpredictable than usual. Achieving stardom was even a riskier toss of the 
dice. Several pop singers embarked on Hollywood careers during that period 
just like Elvis had, and many of them co-starred in serious films by major 
directors. Yet, they experienced only limited success as legitimate actors. If 
Elvis had abandoned the musical vehicles that his audiences preferred, he 
might have fizzled out as a serious actor like pop singers Pat Boone, Tommy 
Sands, Ricky Nelson, Fabian, and Frankie Avalon had when they tried to reach 
beyond their natural charisma and singing talents.

164
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man 
A variation on the argument that Elvis could have been a great actor pur-
ports that Elvis should have followed in the acting footsteps of rebels James 
Dean and Marlon Brando by appearing in serious dramas in which he played 
rebels, outsiders, antiheroes, or mavericks. He had started down that path 
with Jailhouse Rock and King Creole, and he returned to that sort of character 
in Wild in the Country, but the musical comedies pushed him in a different 
direction.
However, both Dean and Brando had seriously studied the Method approach 
to acting at the prestigious Actors Studio in New York City. The Method is 
an internal approach to acting in which the actor attempts to step into the 
emotional and mental shoes of his character. The actor uses personal memo-
ries and experiences to realistically portray intense emotions. The Method 
requires study and practice to accomplish well. Elvis, on the other hand, was 
never trained. During Elvis’s heyday in Hollywood, the new wave of legitimate 
actors who were gaining attention in the film industry had studied acting as 
a craft in college or in acting schools. How far Elvis’s natural charm and cha-
risma would have taken him in serious drama is unknown. Without training, 
Elvis had no guarantee that he could have handled complex, serious roles in 
the long term.
 
When looking at the state of the industry during the time frame of Elvis’s 
career, and considering his lack of formal training, it’s clear that his chances 
of becoming a James Dean, a Marlon Brando, or any other serious actor 
weren’t good. The biographers that suggest otherwise fail to consider film 
history.
Disputing the criticism that the movies hurt his music
Some say that Elvis’s Hollywood career weakened his music and squandered 
his musical and creative talents. But, this argument indirectly proposes 
several assumptions about his movie career, including the suggestion that 
Elvis would have continued to be a rock ’n’ roll innovator if not for his “going 
Hollywood.” Whether Elvis would have continued as a musical innovator if 
he hadn’t pursued a Hollywood career is speculative at best, but most likely 
he would have still abandoned his regionally flavored rock ’n’ roll style for 
several reasons.
When Elvis returned from the army in 1960, he was faced with a new music 
scene. Ballad singers and pop stylists had increased in popularity during the 
late 1950s, softening rock ’n’ roll as a genre until the mid-1960s. At that point, 
the British Invasion spearheaded by The Beatles changed the direction of 
rock once again. The early 1960s were dominated by the smooth sounds of 
singers such as Frankie Avalon, Pat Boone, Fabian, Paul Anka, Connie Francis, 
Bobby Darin, and Tommy Sands. The trend represented a shift from the doo-
wop, rhythm-and-blues, and Southern-flavored rockabilly that rocked the 
radio airwaves and shocked the industry pundits in the mid-1950s. So Elvis’s 
pop-rock music of the 1960s fit nicely into the pop sounds of the era.

165
 Chapter 10: Defending Elvis’s Movies: They’re Not That Bad
 
Perhaps one of the reasons critics of his pop sound and mature image dismiss 
his music during this era is because Elvis set trends during the 1950s, but he 
seemed to merely follow them in the 1960s.
One of the most compelling reasons that Elvis wouldn’t have continued sing-
ing his regionally flavored rock ’n’ roll involved the nasty scandals surround-
ing this style of music. In addition to the accusations that the music incited 
juvenile delinquency and riots, several specific rock ’n’ roll pioneers got into 
trouble while Elvis was in the army.
In 1958, for example, the press discovered that Elvis’s fellow Sun Studio 
recording artist Jerry Lee Lewis had married his 13-year-old cousin while 
still married to his first wife. Lewis was virtually blackballed in the industry. 
Radio stations refused to play his records and many of his tour bookings 
were cancelled. The year before, flamboyant entertainer Little Richard turned 
his back on rock ’n’ roll when he found God. The singer walked away from the 
music industry during a major tour, causing huge losses for booking agents 
and tour promoters. Later, when he wanted to return to show business, his 
earlier actions made agents and promoters leery of booking him. In 1960, 
“Johnny B. Good” singer Chuck Berry was charged with a Mann Act violation 
when he drove an underage girl across state lines. He was convicted and 
went to prison for almost three years.
During the 1950s, many in the media felt that Elvis was headed for scandals 
such as these because of his provocative performing style. However, his stint 
in the army had cooled the controversy and paved the way for a different 
career path — one that wisely steered him away from the notoriety of rocka-
billy and rock ’n’ roll. (See Chapter 7 for more information on the effect of 
Elvis’s army service on his career.)
Appreciating Elvis’s Movies As Part 
of the Teen Musical Subgenre
Elvis wasn’t the only pop or rock ’n’ roll singer to star in lighthearted musi-
cal comedies or the occasional youth-oriented melodrama during the 1960s. 
From Elvis and Frankie Avalon to Herman’s Hermits, many of the decade’s 
chart-topping singers and bands found themselves in vehicles developed 
around their signature sounds or styles. These films share enough character-
istics to be identifiable as a specific subgenre, or subcategory, of the musical 
comedy. Elvis’s films are part of this subgenre known as teen musicals.
In this section, I describe the characteristics of the teen musical and put the 
subgenre in context of the times to show how it reflects the issues, preoccu-
pations, and culture of the young. I also show you how Elvis’s films fit neatly 

166
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man 
into this group. When comparing the Presley Travelogues to other films in 
the same subgenre, the success of his movies makes sense — and their fluffi-
ness seems less objectionable.
The typical teen musical
Teen musicals evolved from the low-budget, black-and-white rock ’n’ roll 
movies pioneered by the King of the Quickies, Sam Katzman, in the 1950s. 
(See Chapter 8 for information on how Katzman crossed paths with Elvis.) 
Like Katzman’s quickies, later teen musicals appealed to a youthful demo-
graphic by showcasing the music of performers that young people idolized as 
well as the slang and fashion fads of the day. Unlike Katzman’s movies, teen 
musicals of the 1960s were shot in Technicolor, making them candy-colored 
romantic fantasies for the young — or the young at heart.
The success of the teen musical, including the Presley Travelogues, began 
with the music, which was the bait to draw in the target audience. The teen 
musical’s appeal also depended on capturing the sense of fun and optimism 
that goes with being young, while at the same time underpinning it with the 
accepted ideals and values of mainstream culture. So, Elvis’s singing, girl-
chasing characters breeze into town looking for the big score, a new adven-
ture, or the next race, but what they find instead is the right girl and the 
potential for a happy family.
 
Consider how the following elements fit into the teen musical:
 
✓ Music: Teen musicals cram as many songs or musical acts as possible 
into running times. During Elvis’s era, some of the musicals featured 
pop-flavored songs that sounded more like a Hollywood executive’s idea 
of what rock music should be. Others included performances by actual 
rock ’n’ roll bands of the era.
 
✓ Plot: Plots of teen musicals revolve around the romantic complications 
of teens and young adults, who are depicted as living in a world of their 
own. Adults are outsiders to this world, so they are relegated to comic 
relief or uptight authority figures. The audiences’ identification with the 
troubles, trends, music, and slang of this youth-oriented world is a key 
to a teen musical’s success.
 
✓ Setting: Stories for teen musicals are often set in locations popular with 
teens. During Elvis’s day, these included vacation resorts, Ft. Lauderdale, 
and other beachlike spots. The films capture the pleasures of youthful 
pastimes, which in Elvis’s day included car racing, surfing, playing sports, 
nightclub hopping, or meeting at the local hangout.

167
 Chapter 10: Defending Elvis’s Movies: They’re Not That Bad
 
✓ Conflict: Teen musicals also reflect serious youth-oriented dilemmas, 
particularly those involving individuality versus peer pressure; freedom 
versus responsibility; romance versus sex; and youth versus maturity. 
While the story lines are lighthearted and some of the characters comi-
cal and fun loving, it’s the themes that audiences relate to because these 
are serious issues that most young people struggle with.
The teen musicals from the 1960s that were set at the beach remain the most 
well-known examples, because they have become an icon of American pop cul-
ture. The best-remembered beach movies, which starred Annette Funicello and 
Frankie Avalon, were produced quickly by low-budget champions American 
International Pictures (AIP). The series started with Beach Party (1963) and 
followed with several additional movies using the same formula. In each film, 
Funicello played DeeDee, who spent most of the plot trying to keep Frankie, 
played by Avalon, in check. As the series continued, the subplots became 
zanier, adding bikers, mermaids, and evil twins to the mix.
When the beach began to look too familiar, the party moved to the ski slopes. 
A whole new subseries was born after producer Gene Corman at AIP decided 
to use a ski resort as the setting for Ski Party. Not to be outdone in the wacky 
department, Ski Party featured a talking, skiing polar bear. This sort of zany, 
unrealistic detail is not unusual in the teen musical, so the exaggerated char-
acters and plot events of Elvis’s Kissin’ Cousins and Harum Scarum are in 
keeping with the subgenre. (See Chapter 8 for a more information on these 
two films.)
 
Some of the British rock groups that invaded American shores in the mid-
1960s also were packaged into musical vehicles to showcase their mod fash-
ions, long hair, discothèque hangouts, and specific style of rock music. Peter 
Noone’s band, Herman’s Hermits, made a splash with their feature film Hold 
On! (1966) while the Dave Clark Five muddled through Catch Us If You Can 
(1965).
The Presley Travelogues
Elvis’s vehicles make sense when considered within the context of the teen 
musical (described in the preceding section). The formulaic plots, endless 
songs, and wacky moments that stretch believability aren’t so much weak-
nesses in his films, because they’re typical of the subgenre. In the following 
sections, I compare and contrast Elvis’s movies in this subgenre with the 
typical teen musical.

168
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man 
Comparing the similarities
In general, the Presley Travelogues adapted many of the conventions of the 
teen musical. Consider these characteristics, which mirror the conventions 
listed in the preceding section:
 
✓ Music: The Travelogues averaged 10 to 12 songs per film.
 
✓ Plot: Like other teen musicals, the plots focused on romance while the 
characters worked to achieve a recognizable goal, such as winning a 
race, finding a job, or earning money.
 
✓ Setting: The Travelogues were set in exotic locales or vacation spots, 
such as Las Vegas, Acapulco, the World’s Fair, Ft. Lauderdale, or simply 
the race track or beach.
 
✓ Conflict: Elvis’s character generally matured from a footloose and 
fancy-free race car driver, pilot, or charter-boat skipper to responsible 
husband material by the end of the movie, reflecting a key theme. Elvis’s 
movies contrasted the fun of staying young and chasing girls with the 
responsibility of being in a mature relationship.
In addition to following the conventions of the teen musical subgenre in gen-
eral, some of Elvis’s movies also were directly influenced by specific films. 
Here are some examples:
 
✓ After spring break in Ft. Lauderdale and other resort areas became a 
popular subject (with the films Where the Boys Are [1960] and Palm 
Springs Weekend [1963]), Elvis starred in his own Lauderdale adventure, 
which was titled Girl Happy (1965).
Elvis’s best costars
The following list includes some names you 
probably recognize. Each actor or actress here 
is respected within the film industry, and their 
talents contributed to the production values of 
the Presley Travelogues.
 ✓ Walter Matthau, Carolyn Jones, and Dean 
Jagger in King Creole (1958)
 ✓ Juliet Prowse in G.I. Blues (1960)
 ✓ Dolores Del Rio and John McIntire in 
Flaming Star (1960)
 ✓ Angela Lansbury in Blue Hawaii (1961)
 ✓ Gig Young in Kid Galahad (1962)
 ✓ Tuesday Weld, Hope Lange, and Millie 
Perkins in Wild in the Country (1961)
 ✓ Arthur O’Connell in Follow That Dream 
(1962) and Kissin’ Cousins (1964)
 ✓ Ann-Margret in Viva Las Vegas (1964)
 ✓ Barbara Stanwyck and Leif Erickson in 
Roustabout (1964)
 ✓ Joan Blondell in Stay Away, Joe (1968)
 ✓ Mary Tyler Moore and Jane Elliot in Change 
of Habit (1969)

169
 Chapter 10: Defending Elvis’s Movies: They’re Not That Bad
 
✓ When the mod scene in England and Europe was all the rage, as in Catch 
Us If You Can (1965), Elvis appeared in Double Trouble (1967), which fea-
tured the swinging discothèques of London and Amsterdam.
 
✓ The considerable number of Presley Travelogues set near tropical 
beaches, including Blue Hawaii (1961), Paradise, Hawaiian Style (1966), 
and Clambake (1967), reflected the popularity of the Frankie and Annette 
beach movies.
 
Many of the costars in Elvis’s films also appeared in the other teen musicals. 
An entire troupe of actors became instantly recognizable for their associa-
tion with this subgenre. Nancy Sinatra, Yvonne Craig, Shelley Fabares, Gary 
Crosby, Pam Austin, Joby Baker, and Chris Noel crossed over from one teen 
musical to another. And no matter how much they aged, they were always wel-
come at the party.
Contrasting the differences
The Presley Travelogues differ from the teen musicals because they were 
intended for a mainstream audience of older adults, children, and families 
in addition to the audience of teens and young adults. Unlike the typi-
cal teen musical, Elvis’s films include children and senior citizens, and it 
wasn’t unusual for his character to become attached to a child as part of his 
maturing process (as in It Happened at the World’s Fair [1963] and Paradise, 
Hawaiian Style [1966]). In both instances, Elvis’s character is forced into a 
situation in which he has to look out for a child’s safety, which reveals his 
maturity and responsibility. Likewise, Elvis’s characters sometimes sang to 
older people, such as the leading lady’s grandmother, which helped Elvis 
appeal to the age group least familiar with teen musicals.
Unlike many of the teen musicals, Elvis’s films are surprisingly multicultural. 
In Blue Hawaii, his character dates a native Hawaiian against his mother’s 
wishes, and he easily adopts aspects of her culture, symbolized by his final 
musical number, “Hawaiian Wedding Song.” In Girls! Girls! Girls! he’s close 
friends with a Chinese family, and he sings to their young daughters. In 
Paradise, Hawaiian Style, his character works with a Japanese partner, played 
by Japanese actor James Shigeta.
Elvis’s films also stand out from the crowd because many of them boast 
high-quality production values, especially those produced by Hal Wallis. 
By production values, I mean the craftsmanship of a film and how well basic 
filmmaking techniques are used to enhance the material, no matter how 
slight that material might be. Wallis employed veteran Hollywood directors, 
cinematographers, and editors to ensure that his films had the highest level 
of craftsmanship. He took advantage of shooting on location to showcase 
the exotic scenery or to capture a sense of authenticity, and he hired some 
of Hollywood’s best scene-stealing character actors to elevate the level of 
acting. Better budgets accounted in part for the high production values but 
they also were the result of Wallis’s talents and experience. One need only 

170
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man 
compare Blue Hawaii to Beach Party to see the difference between Elvis’s 
teen musicals and the typical example of the genre. Both are fun to watch, 
but the Wallis-produced Blue Hawaii exhibits higher production values.
 
A review of Easy Come, Easy Go (1967) from Variety commented on the quality 
of Elvis’s movies: “Anyone who has seen similar films recognizes the superior 
quality of Presley’s films; the story makes sense; the songs are better, and 
better motivated; cast and direction are stronger; production values are first-
rate.”
 
Part of the quality of Elvis’s films comes from his fellow actors. He worked 
with some of the best in the business, past and present. Some of his col-
leagues were movie stars, some starlets, some character actors, and some vet-
erans from another era, but all of them raised the level of the acting in the 
films, causing the films to stand out from the average teen musical. See the 
nearby sidebar “Elvis’s best costars” for a list of the most notable actors and 
actresses he worked with during this period.
Revealing how the movie music works
Those who criticize the movie music in Elvis’s vehicles tend to overlook the 
songs’ critical functions in helping tell the story. This lack of understanding 
sheds a different light on the songs, which may work well within the context 
of the story but seem silly outside of the movies. To truly evaluate Elvis’s 
movie music, you have to take into consideration the way movie music 
works.
Most of Elvis’s films were integrated musicals. In these musicals, the songs 
and production numbers were integrated into the story lines. This is the 
type of musical in which characters randomly break out into song — while 
they’re driving, working, arguing, or going about some other daily activity. In 
contrast are backstage musicals, which are nonintegrated. In backstage story 
lines, the musical numbers are part of a show that the characters are staging.
Integrated musicals are more fanciful and require a greater suspension of 
disbelief, while backstage musicals are more grounded in reality. Most of the 
Presley Travelogues and even some of Elvis’s other movies, such as Follow 
That Dream (1962) and Kid Galahad (1962), are examples of integrated musi-
cals. His pre-army musical dramas, such as Jailhouse Rock and King Creole, 
are considered backstage musicals.
 
In the integrated musicals, the songs play a part in the story line. They 
advance the plot, relate something about a character, or create the mood for a 
scene. The lyrics and sometimes just a few bars of the melody can take the 
place of scripted dialogue to communicate important information. Yet, outside 

171
 Chapter 10: Defending Elvis’s Movies: They’re Not That Bad
the film, these songs are often too specific to the story to stand on their own. 
Unfortunately, many critics of his movie music do just that — discuss them 
out of context.
The conclusion of Blue Hawaii (1961) provides an excellent example of how 
production numbers or songs function in an integrated musical. Like most of 
the Presley Travelogues, the plot revolves around a goal or quest that Elvis’s 
character is hoping to achieve, and the pursuit of the leading lady parallels 
that goal or quest. The completion of the goal is indicated by the union of 
Elvis with his leading lady, and their union is revealed by the closing produc-
tion number.
Elvis’s character’s success in the tourist industry in Blue Hawaii isn’t 
announced through dialogue. Instead, it’s revealed by his elaborate wedding 
to the woman who helped him get his start as a tour guide. In the movie, 
Elvis’s character states that he wouldn’t marry the leading lady until he 
proved himself. So the wedding represents both personal and professional 
triumph. The wedding itself isn’t a traditional ceremony with spoken vows; 
it’s depicted as the closing production number titled “Hawaiian Wedding 
Song.” It is this musical number — and only this musical number — that 
trumpets the union of Elvis with his leading lady as well as his professional 
success.
Following in Elvis’s Footsteps
Elvis and his management team of the Colonel, Abe Lastfogel of the William 
Morris talent agency, and producer Hal Wallis weren’t the first to plot a cli-
ent’s career path from one arena of entertainment to another. The strategy 
had been around since the silent era, when vaudeville performers success-
fully launched careers in Hollywood by tailoring movies to their specific 
talents. But Elvis’s career represents one of the most successful examples, 
because he conquered so many arenas of entertainment and reinvented him-
self more than once. As such, his career — all of it — should be examined 
and given its due.
Singers, rap artists, comedians, and even sports figures hoping to build 
a long-term career continually break into movies in vehicles constructed 
around their talents and star images. For instance, many alumni from 
Saturday Night Live — from John Belushi to Will Ferrell — have broadened 
their appeal by courting a mass audience through the movies. Similarly, con-
troversial rap artists, such as Ice-T and Ice Cube, have become successful 
actors in family programs and movies by charting a path similar to Elvis’s. 
Even rebellious and unpredictable rapper Eminem starred in 8 Mile (2002), 
a movie about a talented but troubled rap artist based on events in his own 

172
Part II: From Hot-Headed Rebel to Hollywood Leading Man 
life. Much like Loving You did for Elvis Presley in 1957, 8 Mile brought main-
stream recognition to Eminem, at least for awhile, resulting in his Academy 
Award win for best song.
Academy Award nominee Eddie Murphy, who became a star through his 
stint as a cast member on Saturday Night Live, was a King-size Elvis fan when 
he was a teenager. Yet, Murphy wasn’t influenced by Elvis’s singing style. 
Instead, he was enamored with Presley’s magnitude as a star. The fact that 
Elvis conquered more than one arena of show business — recording, live per-
formance, television, and films — inspired the young comedian, who wanted 
to parlay his own television success into other areas. Murphy became a 
stand-up comic in major venues, recorded an album, and then became a 
popular movie star in a series of comedy vehicles designed around his talent. 
When Murphy proclaimed Elvis to be the greatest entertainer of all time, the 
focus was on the word “entertainer,” alluding to his well-rounded stardom.
 
All these examples, especially Murphy’s, validate Elvis’s career path, including 
his much-maligned movie career. The Presley Travelogues may not be inspir-
ing in and of themselves, but the decision by the Colonel and others to change 
the course of Elvis’s career by broadening his audience has proven to be 
influential.

Part III
From the Las 
Vegas Stage to the 
End of the Road

In this part . . .
E
lvis’s decision to become a Hollywood leading man 
clearly worked too well, because throughout the 1960s 
audiences had forgotten his rockabilly roots. Fortunately, 
he revitalized his career with The ’68 Comeback Special, 
which reminded America of his power and charisma as a 
performer. The success of the special encouraged Elvis to 
return to the stage. In 1969, he opened at the International 
Hotel in Las Vegas to sold-out audiences, which jump-
started the last stage of his career. This last phase was 
dominated by nonstop concerts and touring.
The rigors of the road, personal disappointments, and 
other problems took their toll on Elvis Presley, and his 
career began to decline in the mid-1970s. But not before 
he accomplished several one-of-a-kind achievements, 
including his stint at Madison Square Garden in 1972 and 
his Aloha from Hawaii television special in 1973. This part 
examines the last stage of Elvis’s career, which is the phase 
most associated with the singer because of his preferred 
costume, the jumpsuit. This part ends with the sad news of 
Elvis Presley’s death on August 16, 1977.

D
espite being financially lucrative — and, therefore, a success in the 
eyes of his manager Colonel Tom Parker — Elvis’s movie career left 
him disappointed, depressed, and downhearted. By the mid-1960s, he was 
no longer challenged by the movies he made or the soundtrack albums he 
recorded. Changes in the music scene during the 1960s — particularly after 
The Beatles spearheaded the British Invasion — rendered Elvis Presley old 
hat in the eyes of the youth market that he helped create and define.
The dejected Elvis didn’t realize his significance to the music scene at the 
time, but fortunately others did. In the late 1960s, several people outside 
Elvis’s immediate circle challenged and influenced him to change the course 
of his career. For Elvis to completely remold his image for the public and 
then deliver some of the finest music of his career represents a comeback of 
mythic proportions. That this phase of his career would come to a tragic end 
doesn’t detract from the magic of the moment when the King of Rock ’n’ Roll 
returned from a long respite to reclaim his throne.
In this chapter, I discuss music producer Felton Jarvis, who inspired Elvis 
to record something other than movie soundtracks; Steve Binder, who pro-
duced and directed Elvis — The ’68 Comeback Special; and Chips Moman, 
who produced From Elvis in Memphis, one of the best albums of the singer’s 
career. The success of these ventures, especially The Comeback Special, reju-
venated Elvis’s career, setting the stage — literally — for his return to live 
performances.

176
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
Getting Back on Track 
with a New Producer
In 1967, Elvis recorded his most well-known gospel album, How Great Thou 
Art. The album effectively boosted Elvis’s career, because it sold well, 
charted significantly, and won awards. Most importantly, cutting the album 
improved Elvis’s morale and rekindled his passion for recording. Felton 
Jarvis not only produced an exceptional album, but he also inspired Elvis to 
select material he believed in, which was something the singer had not done 
in a while. This section examines Jarvis’s working relationship with Elvis, 
explores the music they made together, and discusses the role the music 
played in the singer’s comeback.
Working with producer Felton Jarvis
In May 1966, Felton Jarvis, who was on staff at RCA, agreed to produce Elvis’s 
next album. Jarvis felt that the quality of Elvis’s music had slipped during the 
1960s, and he wanted to improve the sound of the recordings and the selec-
tion of the material. Elvis and Jarvis immediately hit it off, with the young 
producer grasping right away what Elvis wanted in a sound mix.
Jarvis replaced legendary country guitarist Chet Atkins, who had produced 
several of Elvis’s non-soundtrack albums. In fact, Atkins suggested that Jarvis 
take over producing Elvis’s albums, because he thought that Jarvis was more 
suited to the singer’s working methods, which grew out of Elvis’s unconven-
tional lifestyle.
For example, the low-key Atkins wasn’t inclined to push Elvis to record, so 
few recordings were made in the mid-1960s that weren’t related to movie 
soundtracks. Atkins also disapproved of the singer’s unstructured approach 
to cutting an album. Elvis liked to book a few days to record and then cut the 
album in long, marathon sessions that often lasted through the night. Elvis 
was accustomed to odd hours, and he thought nothing of working until dawn. 
But Atkins detested this approach. To Elvis, a song was finished when it felt 
right to him. If that meant he had to record the song 40 times to get it to that 
place, he stayed until the job was done.
 
Like Elvis, Jarvis was a man with eclectic musical tastes who was accustomed 
to late hours and the unconventional lifestyle of creative people. He also was 
a true fan who credited Elvis for inspiring him to pursue a job in the music 
industry. Plus Jarvis’s enthusiastic personality was infectious and often influ-
enced the atmosphere of recording sessions, which encouraged Elvis to push 
himself. With so much in common, Jarvis thought of himself and Elvis as true 
musical allies. No wonder they made beautiful music together.

177
 Chapter 11: Making the Comeback of a Lifetime
With Jarvis as producer, Elvis cut an award-winning gospel album and 
recorded at least two important singles, “Guitar Man” and “U.S. Male,” which 
foreshadowed his musical rebound. Jarvis remained Elvis’s primary producer 
until the singer’s death in 1977.
Perfecting Elvis’s songs and their sound
The music Elvis made with Jarvis was better than a lot of the music he made 
in the ’60s for two important reasons: Elvis had a better selection of material 
to choose from, and Jarvis improved the sound of the recordings themselves. 
Together Elvis and Jarvis improved the songs and the sound.
Advancing mediocre material
Jarvis had discovered that Elvis’s two music publishing companies — Gladys 
Music and Elvis Presley Music — required songwriters to fork over partial 
publishing credit and a percentage of their royalties in order to have their 
songs recorded by Elvis. Most decent songwriters refused to accept this deal. 
As a result, Elvis’s publishing companies usually had to acquire songs from 
mediocre writers. Because the Colonel and RCA executives preferred that 
Elvis record tunes only from his publishing companies because of the finan-
cial advantages, it was small wonder that the singer was drowning in bad 
material. (See Chapter 4 for more information on Elvis’s publishing compa-
nies and how they operated.)
So Jarvis went to work improving Elvis’s material. He knew several young, tal-
ented songwriters whose work was perfect for Elvis, and he exposed Presley 
to their songs. “Big Boss Man” by Al Smith and Luther Dixon and “Guitar 
Man” by up-and-coming country artist Jerry Reed became two recordings 
that proved important for Elvis, because they would later be included in The 
’68 Comeback Special. It was always a struggle to get the Colonel and RCA 
execs to agree to let Elvis record the work of outside talent, and to let those 
songwriters keep the publishing rights, but Jarvis was instrumental in chang-
ing hearts and minds enough to allow for the possibility.
Developing a high-quality sound
After collecting a better selection of material for Elvis to choose from, Jarvis 
improved the sound quality of Elvis’s recordings. He did so by basically 
“undoing” what the producers of his soundtrack albums had been doing for 
years. Beginning in the early 1960s, Elvis noticed that his albums were mixed 
so that the sound of the musicians and the voices of the background sing-
ers were turned way down, which made his voice too prominent. The music, 
background vocals, and Elvis’s vocals didn’t work as an integrated whole, 
and the recordings lacked energy and excitement. However, RCA executives, 
the Colonel, and the movie studios didn’t care, because making good records 

178
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
was secondary to exploiting their star. Flip to Chapter 8 for an example of 
Elvis being overexposed through the movies and their accompanying sound-
track albums.
Elvis told his new producer that he wanted a big sound, increased levels 
on the background vocals, and heartier instrumentation, and Jarvis agreed. 
Much of the singer’s pop-flavored music of the 1960s had been sent to New 
York to be mixed by engineers and producers who knew little of Elvis’s 
strengths and talents. Jarvis thought their mixing inadequate for someone of 
the stature of Elvis Presley. So he improved the sound enormously by per-
sonally supervising the mixing of Elvis’s recordings.
Spreading the Gospel
Elvis and Jarvis’s musical collaboration paid off on the gospel album How 
Great Thou Art, which reveals the producer’s efforts to improve the sound 
and quality of Presley’s work.
 
As a child of the South, Elvis was steeped in gospel music, and he loved the 
four-part harmony style sung by male gospel quartets such as his frequent 
backup singers, the Jordanaires. So Elvis was thrilled when Jarvis hired his 
long-time favorite quartet, the Imperials, whose lead singer was the colorful 
Jake Hess, to back him on How Great Thou Art. In addition, the Jordanaires 
were on board as usual, along with a female vocal group that added a wider 
range to the sound. A high point of the album, at least for Elvis, occurred when 
Elvis and Hess sang a duet on “If the Lord Wasn’t Walking by My Side.”
On How Great Thou Art, Jarvis brought out certain aspects of Elvis’s voice 
that were seldom used, including reaching into the falsetto range and using a 
vibrato technique. Unaccustomed to pushing himself with these techniques, 
Elvis worked hard to perfect them. The new techniques forced him to sing 
parts over and over, but with Jarvis’s patience and enthusiasm, Elvis suc-
ceeded. Songs such as the title track and “Stand by Me” feature some of 
Elvis’s most expressive interpretations of any songs he recorded in his entire 
career. However, after a few days of recording, Elvis grew weary (which 
wasn’t unusual behavior for him), and the gospel sessions ended abruptly.
In September 1967, more sessions with Jarvis were arranged because RCA 
wanted a follow-up album to How Great Thou Art. During this time, “Guitar 
Man” and “U.S. Male” were cut, but tensions over securing material from out-
side songwriters resulted in arguments in the studio, particularly when those 
in Elvis’s camp pushed Jerry Reed to let go of the publishing rights to “Guitar 
Man.” Reed refused to cave, and eventually he was able to retain the rights. 
Because of these troubles, Elvis again lost his enthusiasm for these record-
ing sessions, and the second album was delayed because the team lacked 
material.

179
 Chapter 11: Making the Comeback of a Lifetime
Savoring the success of 
How Great Thou Art
How Great Thou Art effectively boosted Elvis’s career, a fact borne out by the 
statistics. The album reaped over $1 million in record sales, earning a gold 
record. It reached number 18 on the Billboard list of Top LPs, and it remained 
on the charts for 29 weeks. The soundtrack albums Elvis recorded, which 
sometimes numbered three a year, hadn’t performed this well since the early 
1960s.
 
The album also brought Elvis his first Grammy Award. Elvis won only three 
Grammys during his lifetime — all of them for gospel recordings. How Great 
Thou Art won Best Sacred Performance in 1967, the album He Touched Me won 
Best Inspirational Performance in 1972, and a live version of the hymn “How 
Great Thou Art” won Best Inspirational Performance in 1974.
Elvis felt a kinship with Jarvis and looked forward to working with him again. 
It’s certainly fitting that Elvis and Jarvis created a gospel album at a time 
when the singer was at a creative and spiritual low. He was discouraged by 
his movie career and uninterested in the soundtrack music he was forced 
to record. In the past, gospel had inspired his interest in music, and it had 
calmed his nerves before recording sessions and performances. And then 
during 1966 and 1967, it soothed his soul and reminded him of his breadth 
and range as a singer, encouraging him to record material that he believed in. 
As they say in the South, it called him back home. Recording How Great Thou 
Art with Felton Jarvis proved to be a step on the path to a comeback — not 
only because of the quality and success of the album but also because of its 
effect on Elvis’s morale.
Creating a Hit: The ’68 
Comeback Special
The ’68 Comeback Special, a highly innovative television program, represents 
a turning point in Elvis’s career because it inspired him to return to live per-
formances. However, if the Colonel would have had his way during the pro-
duction of the special, it may not have turned out so well. This section details 
the production of the special — from its conception by the creative team to 
its perception by the public.
 
The ’68 Comeback Special was originally titled Elvis, but Singer Presents Elvis 
was printed on some of the promotional materials (because of its affiliation 
with Singer Sewing Machines). However, because the program was instru-
mental in revitalizing Elvis’s music and career, it has since become known as 

180
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
The ’68 Comeback Special. The name has become so pervasive that only the 
most die-hard of Elvis’s fans remember the original title, and many books refer 
to the program only as The ’68 Comeback Special, or simply The Comeback 
Special.
Shaping the special
In early 1968, Colonel Tom Parker closed a deal with NBC and Singer Sewing 
Machines for Elvis to appear in his own television Christmas special. The spe-
cial would be broadcast on NBC and sponsored entirely by Singer. The show 
eventually aired on December 3, 1968, but it was actually produced during 
the summer months.
When Parker made the deal with NBC for a television special starring his one 
and only client, Elvis Presley, he wanted a program that could be quickly 
produced with the least amount of effort — and for a rock-bottom price. His 
vision for an Elvis Presley Christmas special was to have “his boy” stand in 
front of a festive holiday set with a decorated tree, sing familiar carols for an 
hour, and then wish everyone a Merry Christmas. Fade out.
The creative personnel behind the special completely disagreed with the 
Colonel’s idea. They wanted to use the special to capture what they felt was 
Elvis’s genius — his music. They wanted to prove that the singer’s original 
music had been essential to the development of rock ’n’ roll and that Elvis 
wasn’t some relic from the past. And the Colonel’s idea had “relic” written all 
over it.
With their innovative approach to the special, the creative team — led by 
producer-director Steve Binder — got Elvis on their side, and in one of the 
few times in his career, the singer defied his manager. He told the Colonel in 
no uncertain terms that he wanted to do the special Binder’s way.
 
The creative team behind the special had plenty of experience showcasing 
modern music for a mainstream audience, so Elvis was in good hands as you 
can see from the following list of key players:
 
✓ Producer-director Steve Binder had earned a reputation for captur-
ing the high-powered energy of rock music on film with the legend-
ary T.A.M.I. Show, a 1964 concert movie featuring the biggest acts 
of the time, including The Rolling Stones and James Brown. He also 
directed several episodes of NBC’s prime-time rock-music variety show, 
Hullabaloo.
 
✓ Executive producer Bob Finkel, one of four executive producers under 
exclusive contract to NBC, specialized in variety shows. The prolific 
producer was responsible for The Andy Williams Show, for which he 

181
 Chapter 11: Making the Comeback of a Lifetime
won three Emmys, The Perry Como Show, The Dinah Shore Show, and 
The Jerry Lewis Show, among others. He earned the prestigious Peabody 
Award for The Julie Andrews Show. Well respected in the industry, Finkel 
was later elected president of the Producer’s Guild of America.
 
✓ Musical engineer Bones Howe was a recording engineer who became 
a top independent music producer during the 1960s, producing hit 
records for The Turtles, The Association, and Jerry Lee Lewis, among 
others. The year after The ’68 Comeback Special, Howe won a Grammy 
for his production of the Record of the Year, “Aquarius/Let the Sunshine 
In” by the 5th Dimension. Later, he became a pioneer in promoting the 
use of pop and rock music in motion pictures, which led him to a career 
in music supervision for films.
Binder completely cast aside the Colonel’s idea for the show, and he and 
Howe reshaped the special to fit their vision of Elvis Presley. They envisioned 
the special as a series of high-energy production numbers that showcased 
the musical influences on Elvis’s sound and illustrated how he integrated 
those influences into his own style. After work on the special began, they 
added two informal segments in which Elvis was recorded live singing before 
a small studio audience.
Of all the numbers in the special, the informal segments have earned the 
most acclaim, and yet they originated from such a simple idea. Binder was 
inspired to create this part of the special when he watched Elvis, his long-
time friends and companions, and some of the musicians sit around the baby 
grand piano in the singer’s dressing room on Stage 4 and jam for hours.
Elvis enjoyed this type of informal musical play, which helped him loosen 
up before and after recordings and decrease tension in any professional or 
personal situation. Each day after rehearsals, Binder watched as the group 
sang their hearts out. Elvis played the piano while others drummed on 
chairs, kept time on the piano top, or brought in the occasional tambourine. 
Someone would start to sing or play a song, and then the others would join 
in. The informal group tried all genres, but there was always an emphasis on 
Southern-based music.
Binder began taking notes about the types of songs they played, and then he 
snuck a pocket tape recorder into the dressing room to record the sessions. 
As he watched and listened, he understood that he was witnessing “the real 
Elvis” — a natural-born musician who could integrate musical genres into 
a style that was all his own. And, this inherent love and appreciation of all 
music deeply inspired the other musicians who joined in. Eventually, Binder 
went to Elvis with the idea of including a version of these jam sessions into 
the show.

Looking closely at the completed special
Despite the creative conflicts between the Colonel and Binder, the idea for 
The ’68 Comeback Special was conceived and put into motion. (See the pre-
ceding section to find out more on the conflicts.) The special ended up with 
four production numbers and two informal segments in which Elvis sang live 
before a small studio audience — and no Christmas carols. In this section, I 
describe the production numbers and live segments, explaining their mean-
ings and impacts.
 
“Guitar Man,” the song by Jerry Reed that Elvis recorded with Felton Jarvis 
(see the earlier section “Getting Back on Track with a New Producer” for 
details), became a musical link that loosely tied the special together. The song 
tells the story of a singing guitar player who leaves home to seek his fame and 
fortune in the honky-tonks and nightclubs of the South; Binder and Howe used 
this song as a leitmotif throughout the special. At times, a line or two from the 
song’s chorus pops up in a production number, and Elvis often appears with a 
guitar strapped to his back to remind us that he’s the Guitar Man. Most impor-
tantly, the song provided the story line for the special’s third production 
number.
The production numbers
The polished production numbers in the special combined orchestrated 
music with choreographed routines from the Claude Thompson Dancers. 
Even though these numbers weren’t atypical for the era, they were excep-
tional examples in their use of rock ’n’ roll music, which stripped away any 
sentiment or silliness that sometimes plagued musical specials on the small 
screen. Also, none of the numbers featured spoken dialogue or introductions; 
instead they relied on song and dance to make their points.
 
Each of the following four production numbers showcased a different aspect 
of Elvis’s sound:
 
✓ Trouble: In this number, a dynamic Elvis Presley reminds America that 
he’s still sexy, surly, and downright provocative as he opens the special 
with a bluesy rendition of “Trouble,” from his 1958 film King Creole. The 
atmosphere is electric as a brooding Elvis looks into the camera and 
growls out the opening line, “If you’re looking for trouble/You came to 
the right place.” The camera then pulls back to reveal a background 
reminiscent of the iconic set from the title tune of Jailhouse Rock, Elvis’s 
1957 film. (You can read more about King Creole and Jailhouse Rock in 
Chapter 6.) The entire number purposefully recalls the singer’s past, 
particularly the controversy surrounding Elvis the Pelvis and his gyrat-
ing hips. Check out Chapter 5 to find out more about this controversy.
 
✓ Gospel medley: A dancer interpreting the spiritual “Sometimes I Feel 
Like a Motherless Child” opens a production number devoted to 
gospel music, which inspired Elvis personally and influenced his sound 

183
 Chapter 11: Making the Comeback of a Lifetime
musically. Elvis performs a moving version of “Where Could I Go But to 
the Lord” and “Up Above My Head,” backed by the female vocal trio the 
Blossoms. Then he, the Blossoms, and the Claude Thompson Dancers 
conclude the segment with the rhythm-and-blues-inspired “Saved.” 
Without a word of dialogue or narration, this production number sug-
gests the evolution of popular music from black spirituals to rhythm and 
blues (R&B) to the music of Elvis Presley.
 
✓ Guitar Man: “Guitar Man” pays homage to the secular influences on 
Elvis’s sound, specifically honky-tonk country music. Expanding the 
special’s leitmotif into a musical story, this number features Elvis as the 
Guitar Man, who sings parts of four songs. He begins his journey by sing-
ing “Nothingville” to suggest he’s busted and broke. With only his guitar 
strapped to his back, he roams the honky-tonk bars and carnival midways 
across the South looking for a chance to sing. He encounters carny toughs 
while singing “Big Boss Man” and is tempted by women during “Little 
Egypt.” At the end of the number, the Guitar Man walks off into a prom-
ising future on a road lined with lights while singing a new verse to his 
theme song, which reveals a new maturity achieved through experience.
 
✓ If I Can Dream: “If I Can Dream” was the closing number of the special. 
The song was written by musical director W. Earl Brown, who penned 
the song as a response to the assassinations of Martin Luther King, 
Jr., and Robert Kennedy, which had occurred that year (1968). Brown 
intended for the song to be a heartfelt plea for understanding and a 
statement of hope for the future, so Elvis performed the song with great 
conviction and passion. The large scale of the song, with its reference to 
King’s “I Have a Dream” speech” and its monumental ending, foreshad-
ows Elvis’s music of the 1970s. If “Trouble” celebrated Elvis’s past, “If I 
Can Dream” pointed him toward his future.
The live segments
Two segments in which Elvis sang live before a small studio audience turned 
The ’68 Comeback Special into a showcase for the singer’s strengths. Binder 
interspersed the two live segments, sometimes called the “sit-down seg-
ments,” among the special’s formal production numbers. The two segments 
were cut together from four live shows that Elvis performed in an intimate 
setting to four different audiences. These segments weren’t scripted, and 
they had no specific plan.
In these segments, Elvis and four musicians, including original Blue Moon 
Boys Scotty Moore and D.J. Fontana, sit on a small stage in the round sur-
rounded by an audience of mostly female fans. (See Chapter 3 for information 
on Moore and Fontana.) During a medley of his past hits, Elvis prowls the 
stage like a large cat as he belts out “Hound Dog,” “Blue Suede Shoes,” “All 
Shook Up,” and more. New arrangements, plus Elvis’s lower vocal range, add 
new life to these old tunes, so the effect is electrifying rather than nostal-
gic. True to the eclectic nature of his repertoire, Elvis also sang R&B tunes, 
including a blistering rendition of “Tiger Man” and “Memories,” a beautiful 
new pop ballad that would become one of his signature songs.

184
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
Understanding how the special 
redefined Elvis Presley
The ’68 Comeback Special captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience, 
meaning that 42 percent of the people watching television on December 3, 
1968, were watching Elvis Presley. The special was NBC’s biggest ratings vic-
tory for the entire year, and it was the 1968–1969 television season’s highest-
rated prime-time show.
 
More importantly, the special challenged Elvis to interpret and record some 
of the best music of his career, and it reminded him that he was a singer who 
loved to perform for an audience. In fact, after the success of the special, Elvis 
and the Colonel made the decision to return to live performances. The special 
also reminded audiences that the real Elvis Presley wasn’t the guy in an end-
less string of lightweight musical comedies; he was a unique musical talent 
who had changed the course of popular music.
 
Several rock critics and music historians have weighed in on The ’68 
Comeback Special. Perhaps the words of Greil Marcus, who always writes with 
great passion and expression, are the most famous. In his 1975 book Mystery 
Train, Marcus writes, “It was the finest music of his life. If ever there was 
music that bleeds, this was it.” Also awestruck was critic Jon Landau, whose 
oft-repeated remark summarized the viewpoint of many: “There is something 
special about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home.”
Recording From Elvis in Memphis
On the heels of the tremendous ratings of The ’68 Comeback Special, Elvis 
recorded From Elvis in Memphis. It was one of the pivotal albums of his 
career, because it solidified his comeback as a singer who could still shake 
Elvis’s iconic black leather suit
Costume designer Bill Belew, a member of 
Steve Binder’s production team on past televi-
sion specials, designed the iconic black leather 
suit that Elvis wore for the live segments. The 
suit is reminiscent of Elvis’s 1950s image as a 
rebel, but it doesn’t duplicate any costume or 
look that Elvis ever adopted. In other words, it 
recalls the past but doesn’t emulate it. This was 
an important distinction for the creators of The 
’68 Comeback Special.
In the years since the performance, the suit has 
become an icon representing Elvis’s rebirth as 
a musical force to be reckoned with. Refer to 
the color photo section to see Elvis wearing his 
leather suit during the special.

185
 Chapter 11: Making the Comeback of a Lifetime
up the music industry. It also announced his new musical style — a large-
scale sound that defined his career through the rest of his life. In this section, 
I show you the importance of Elvis recording the album in Memphis, the 
development of his new sound, and the people who contributed to it.
Rediscovering Memphis 
as a recording center
Shortly after The ’68 Comeback Special aired, Elvis returned to Tennessee 
to record new material. Instead of using RCA’s facilities in Nashville, where 
Elvis had recorded most of his non-soundtrack music since 1956, he opted to 
cut his new material in his hometown of Memphis. He hadn’t made a record 
there since his days at Sun Studio in 1955 (see Chapter 2 for information on 
Elvis’s early days recording in Memphis).
Elvis was persuaded by members of his inner circle to try Memphis’s 
American Sound Studio, which was operated and co-owned by producer/
engineer Chips Moman. Moman, who was in the midst of the most successful 
period of his career, had a reputation for knowing how to tailor a song to the 
singer.
Recording in his hometown proved to be about more than just geography, 
however. Just as it had in the mid-1950s, Elvis’s new sound was shaped once 
more by the musical influences and history that pervaded Memphis (see 
Chapter 2 for more information on Memphis’s music scene). The blues, R&B, 
and soul music that made the city famous permeated the atmosphere at the 
American Sound Studio, influencing Moman and his house musicians. Their 
eclectic tastes and edgier playing styles stood in marked contrast to the con-
servative nature of Nashville’s producers and sessions musicians. All of this 
made a definite impact on From Elvis in Memphis and on Elvis’s new musical 
direction.
Establishing a musical direction 
with his latest album
 
From Elvis in Memphis became Elvis’s biggest critical and financial success 
since 1960. It charted for 24 weeks on the Billboard list of Top LPs and peaked 
at number 13. In the United Kingdom, the LP actually topped the charts. But, 
more importantly, the high-profile album capped his comeback and estab-
lished a new musical direction that signaled Elvis’s break from the pop-rock 
music associated with his film image.

186
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
Elvis accomplished the break from pop rock in part by focusing on a type 
of music loosely referred to as blue-eyed soul or swamp pop. This music was 
a soulful style of country music tinged with a little R&B, and it integrated 
Southern-based styles and sounds that attracted Elvis. Eager to pursue a 
different musical direction, Elvis embraced this sound and then expanded it 
into something larger and fuller to call his own.
Also helpful was the fact that Elvis felt a kinship with the musicians who 
were part of the American Sound Studio house band. The band consisted of 
young, hip Southern musicians who were steeped in blues and R&B and who 
also had been inspired by Presley’s rockabilly in the 1950s. The house musi-
cians rocked a harder sound than the sessions musicians at RCA in Nashville, 
partly because of the seasoned rhythm section, and this suited Elvis’s musi-
cal preferences.
Elvis also had personal connections with some of the band members, includ-
ing guitarist Reggie Young and organist Bobby Emmons, who had played with 
Bill Black’s Combo in the 1960s (see Chapters 2 and 3 for more information 
on Bill Black). He also knew drummer Gene Christman, who had worked in 
Jerry Lee Lewis’s band. Knowing the musicians in the house band and having 
musical tastes in common with them made it easier for Elvis and Moman to 
achieve the results they wanted.
The album’s sound was rich and full, with Elvis offering emotionally stirring 
interpretations of such songs as “After Loving You” and “True Love Travels 
on a Gravel Road.” Moman wrung the emotion and expression from Elvis 
throughout the sessions, enhancing the drama and power of the songs. 
However, he didn’t allow Elvis to record the way he was accustomed to at 
RCA, where Presley was recorded singing “live” in the studio while the musi-
cians backed him. In other words, everything was recorded on the same 
track. Instead, Moman recorded Elvis, the backup singers, and the musicians 
on separate tracks, and then overdubbed them later. This technique resulted 
in a tightly produced, technically proficient album, and it enhanced the full, 
large-scale sound.
The sessions at the American Sound Studio — and the albums and singles 
that resulted — launched the musical direction that defined the last phase 
of Elvis’s career. The large-scale sound, expressive vocals, and sheer drama 
became an essential part of Elvis’s new style, which proved to be perfect for 
live performance.
 
Categorizing Elvis’s musical style from this phase of his career is difficult. Like 
his original sound, this new direction was at once a combination of influences, 
yet somehow unique to him as a performer. The diversity of Elvis’s song selec-
tion also made categorizing and analyzing his music difficult for journalists 
and reviewers who wrote about him. It wasn’t country or rock ’n’ roll, nor was 
it R&B. Yet, it was all three of those genres at once. Eventually, folks stopped 
trying to label it. It became simply “Elvis’s music.”

187
 Chapter 11: Making the Comeback of a Lifetime
Selecting the songs for the American 
Sound recording sessions
The songs recorded during the three sessions at the American Sound Studio 
represented the following styles of music:
 
✓ Contemporary rhythm and blues as in the song “Only the Strong Survive”
 
✓ Classic country in “From a Jack to a King”
 
✓ A fusion of country and R&B with “In the Ghetto”
Elvis was obligated to record some tunes provided by RCA per his contract 
(see Chapter 4 for more on Elvis’s relationship with RCA). But after he got 
those out of the way, he focused on some of the new compositions offered to 
him by a young generation of country music songwriters, such as Jerry Reed, 
Mac Davis, and Eddie Rabbitt. Like the members of the American Sound 
Studio house band, these songwriters had been liberated and influenced 
by Elvis’s 1950s rockabilly music. Though diverse in genre, the songs were 
unified by their arrangements, which emphasized the large-scale, fully inte-
grated sound that Elvis and Moman had perfected. (See the earlier section 
“Establishing a musical direction with his latest album” for more on Elvis’s 
new sound.)
 
The three sessions at the American Sound Studio totaled about 14 days. Many 
of the songs recorded in the sessions ended up on From Elvis in Memphis, 
which was released in May 1969. A few cuts were released as top-selling sin-
gles during the summer, including “Suspicious Minds.” Later, the leftover cuts 
were combined with several recordings of Elvis onstage to become the double 
album From Memphis to Vegas/From Vegas to Memphis, released in October 
1969. The American Sound Studio sessions produced some of the best record-
ings of Elvis’s career and also some of his biggest hits, including the following:
 
✓ “Suspicious Minds”: This song became Elvis’s first number-one single 
since 1962 — and the last number-one single of his career on the pop 
charts. It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. Written by 
Mark James, this song provides a good example of Elvis’s music from the 
last phase of his career. It’s incredibly fast paced and has a hard-driving 
base line that blends a thundering sound of horns, strings, and drums 
with the voices of Presley and a choir of female backup singers. As the 
song reaches its conclusion, all the elements are propelled forward at 
breakneck speed, rising to seemingly endless crescendo.
 
✓ “In the Ghetto”: This 1969 single sold 1.2 million copies and reached 
number three on the Billboard singles chart and number one in the 
United Kingdom. Country singer and actor Mac Davis wrote the song, 
which offers a message about the endless cycle of poverty and crime. 

188
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
Elvis and his family had been dirt poor in the country and poverty 
stricken in the city, so he could relate firsthand to the lyrics. Though ini-
tially nervous about the sociopolitical content, Elvis grew excited about 
the prospect, especially after Moman mentioned offering the song to 
another singer. Elvis recorded “In the Ghetto” against the objections of 
the Colonel, who disliked message songs.
 
✓ “Kentucky Rain”: Though less well known in retrospect, this song was 
Elvis’s 50th gold record. Country singer Eddie Rabbitt wrote the song 
with Dick Heard; the end result was a pop-inspired composition some-
where between a ballad and a country tune.
 
In 2007, Elvis’s daughter, Lisa Marie, remixed “In the Ghetto,” blending her 
voice with that of her father’s. The song was recorded for download to raise 
money for the homeless victims of Hurricane Katrina, which blasted the 
Southern states in 2005.

Chapter 12
Viva Las Vegas: Returning 
to Live Performances
In This Chapter
▶ Performing at the Las Vegas International Hotel in 1969
▶ Hitting the road again
T
he year 1969 became a seminal year for Elvis Presley in the same ways 
that 1956 and 1960 had. Just as the events in those years determined a 
career course and a specific image for Elvis, so did the events of 1969. This 
year again pointed Elvis toward a new image and a new career direction. 
His dynamic recordings from the first half of that year helped steer him 
toward that goal (see Chapter 11 for more information), but it was his smash 
engagement that summer in Las Vegas at the International Hotel that deter-
mined the last phase of his career and changed his image. The engagement 
at the International proved so successful that Colonel Tom Parker, Elvis’s 
manager, inked a long-term deal with the hotel for Elvis to perform there 
twice a year.
Bolstered by his Las Vegas success, Elvis wanted to return to touring so he 
could perform for those who couldn’t get to Vegas to see him. Shortly after 
an engagement in Vegas in February 1970, Elvis appeared at the Texas 
Livestock Show in the Houston Astrodome. The success of this series of 
record-breaking shows convinced Elvis that he could tour regularly.
The high-profile, critically acclaimed Vegas engagements of 1969 and early 
1970, combined with his return to touring, completely changed Elvis’s image. 
A year earlier, he had been a movie star associated with family-oriented 
musical comedies; now he was touted as a rock ’n’ roll legend who was the 
hottest concert ticket in the country. For the first few years, Elvis enjoyed his 
new career and reveled in his new image, but repetition, depression, and 
boredom eventually wore him down. Four years later, he was in decline 
personally and professionally; he was in a downward spiral with no escape.

190
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road
But, in this chapter, I step back in time to the years before the decline to 
capture the excitement of Elvis Presley experiencing a career high point. 
Throughout 1969 and 1970, a happy, healthy Elvis enjoyed his comeback to 
live performances as fans and nonfans alike scrambled to see his concerts. 
And, the press — for once — appreciated the larger-than-life talent and 
charisma of the King of Rock ’n’ Roll.
Conquering Las Vegas
After Elvis felt the excitement of singing in front of an audience during the 
live segments of The ’68 Comeback Special, he was motivated to return to 
performing in concert. (See Chapter 11 for more information on this special.) 
In February 1969, Elvis was invited to open the brand-new International 
Hotel in July, but he declined, preferring an engagement during the month of 
August. (See the nearby sidebar, “Letting Streisand work out the kinks,” to 
find out why Elvis chose not to open the International.) Reports on the exact 
amount of his salary for this gig vary widely, but Elvis was supposedly paid a 
half-million dollars for four weeks. The marquis at the International read 
simply “ELVIS.” This section offers a detailed account of Elvis’s return to 
performing, one of the most important events in his life and career.
Letting Streisand work out the kinks
The International Hotel was still under con-
struction when owner Kirk Kerkorian asked 
Elvis to open his new hotel — the largest in Las 
Vegas at the time. It featured 1,519 rooms, a 
9-acre open-air leisure area on the roof, and the 
world’s largest casino. The showroom seated 
2,200 people. Staging Elvis’s comeback as 
International’s first engagement would have 
been the perfect monumental event to bring 
attention to the new hotel. However, Parker 
knew that the brand-new showroom would 
have unforeseen problems because it had 
never been tested. He also knew that Elvis’s 
return to the stage was going to be covered 
extensively in the press and that any technical 
problems would have detracted from the impact 
of his return. So the Colonel and Elvis turned 
down Kerkorian.
Barbra Streisand, who had achieved stardom 
the previous year after she won an Academy 
Award for her role in Funny Girl (1968), agreed 
to open the room. Just as Parker predicted, a 
number of problems popped up, including kinks 
in the sound system, which had to be com-
pletely reorganized. So Parker and Presley’s 
decision to turn down Kerkorian’s offer to open 
the hotel clearly worked in their favor.

191
 Chapter 12: Viva Las Vegas: Returning to Live Performances
Preparing for the first concert 
performance in eight years
Elvis hadn’t appeared before a live audience since 1961, a year when his 
music had been much simpler. For his return to live performing, Elvis chose 
not to re-create his earlier image or sound. Instead, he planned his act on a 
broad scale by including a large number of backup vocalists and musicians to 
accompany him onstage at the International.
Joining Elvis onstage were the gospel-singing Imperials, the female vocal 
group the Sweet Inspirations, a rock band, and an orchestra. The members of 
his rock band included well-known guitarist James Burton, drummer Ronnie 
Tutt, bassist Jerry Scheff, keyboard player Larry Muhoberac, and guitarists/
vocalists John Wilkinson and Charlie Hodge. (Hodge had been part of the 
Memphis Mafia since the days when he and Elvis were in the army together.) 
Part of the reason for such an extensive musical backing was undoubtedly 
due to the large room Elvis was to perform in at the International, but the 
enormous sound created by Elvis and his musical entourage seemed fitting 
for the return of a King.
Elvis was frightfully nervous about staging his comeback to live perfor-
mances in Las Vegas, because he had bombed there when he appeared at the 
New Frontier Hotel in April 1956. The sting of his failure hadn’t diminished 
with the passing years. (See Chapter 4 for more information on Elvis’s Vegas 
flop in 1956.) He had time for several rehearsals before his engagement at 
the International, but he had no opportunity to iron out kinks before a live 
audience, which added to his anxiety.
 
The list of celebrities who were set to attend Elvis’s opening included Cary 
Grant, Pat Boone, Fats Domino, Wayne Newton, Dick Clark, Ann-Margret, 
George Hamilton, Angie Dickinson, and Henry Mancini. Elvis also personally 
invited Sam Phillips, the man who had helped him develop his raw talent into 
a unique musical style, and Phillips was proud to attend.
Opening night: July 31, 1969
To the hard-pounding strains of “Blue Suede Shoes,” Elvis walked on stage 
at the International on the evening of July 31, 1969. No emcee was there to 
introduce him. Instead, he introduced himself with his signature moves: He 
grabbed the microphone, struck a familiar pose from the past, and snapped 
his leg back and forth. The crowd jumped from their chairs to give him a 
standing ovation before he sang one note. The sold-out audience began 
to whistle, applaud furiously, and pound on the tables. Singer Petula Clark, 
who had a hit single in the mid-1960s with “Downtown,” stood on her chair 
screaming and applauding. When the ovation began to subside, Elvis 
launched into “Blue Suede Shoes” with such a fury that ten years of being a

Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road
Elvis looked unbelievably handsome that night. He was dressed in a modified 
karate suit made especially for him out of black mohair by Bill Belew, who 
had created his leather costume for The ’68 Comeback Special.
 
Onstage, Elvis’s sense of humor came through as he clowned around with the 
audience. Visibly nervous, he poked fun at himself, joking, “This is my first 
show in nine [sic] years. It could by my last.” He also joked with the crowd 
about the old days and the old songs. At one point, he decided to dedicate his 
next number to the audience and staff at the International: “This is the only 
song I could think of that really expresses my feeling toward the audience,” he 
said in all earnestness, before breaking into “Hound Dog.” This type of self-
deprecating humor would become part of his act.
The high-powered show featured mostly rock ’n’ roll tunes, and Elvis continu-
ally surprised the audience with his energy and diversity of songs. In addition 
to singing his old songs from the 1950s, he performed The Beatles hits 
“Yesterday” and “Hey Jude.” When he launched into a six-minute version of 
“Suspicious Minds,” the excitement was palpable. A single of the song wasn’t 
released until mid-August, so on July 31 most of the audience hadn’t yet 
heard it. When he finally finished the song, the audience gave him another 
standing ovation. Elvis closed his act with “What’d I Say” from Viva Las Vegas 
(1964), and again the sold-out crowd gave him a standing ovation. Even TV 
producer Jack Good, a celebrity in the audience that night, was seen dancing 
on top of his table. Elvis came back for an encore and sang “Can’t Help Falling 
in Love,” which became the song that he closed every show with for the rest 
of his career.
The lengthy show of close to 90 minutes included a playlist of fast-paced rock 
’n’ roll tunes and intensely expressive ballads. Later in the years, Elvis’s play-
list featured more pop and country songs, which changed the flavor of the 
act. But, on his opening night, he intended to move his audience, and he did.
Congratulating Elvis after the show
Backstage after the performance, many celebrities and well-wishers, includ-
ing Cary Grant, were on hand to congratulate Elvis on his triumphant return 
to live performance. In her biography Elvis and Me, Priscilla Beaulieu Presley 
reveals a touching story about Colonel Parker. At this moment of great 
personal and professional triumph for his one and only client, the Colonel 
pushed his way backstage. Everyone could see that tears were welling up in 
his eyes. Where was “his boy” he wanted to know. As Elvis emerged from his 
dressing room, the two men embraced, too overcome with emotion to say 
anything. People have told countless stories about Colonel Tom Parker over 
the years, many of them illustrating his shrewdness, his greed, his mistakes, 
or his ruthlessness. Yet no story reveals the complexity of the relationship 
between Elvis and the Colonel like this one.

193
 Chapter 12: Viva Las Vegas: Returning to Live Performances
 
The period that marked his comeback, which was roughly late 1968 to 1970, 
garnered Elvis some of the best press of his career, with the exception of The 
New York Times, which had never had a positive word for Elvis. This very brief 
time period is the only time he consistently got good reviews that recognized 
the magnitude of his talent. Consider this quotation from the New Yorker as 
representative of that period of time: “Then Presley came on, and immediately 
shook up all my expectations and preconceived categories. There was a new 
man out there.”
Signing the tablecloth deal
In the wee hours of the morning after the opening, the Colonel sat down 
with the general manager of the International Hotel to discuss the enormous 
success of the performance. There in one of the hotel’s cafes, the hotel 
manager offered Elvis a five-year contract to play two months a year — 
February and August — at a salary of $1 million per year. In his typical 
flamboyant style, the Colonel took out a pen and began scribbling specific 
terms on the pink tablecloth. When he finished, he asked the general 
manager to sign the cloth to close the deal. Four days later, a more formal 
document was drawn up — and on paper this time.
In addition to the performance contract, Elvis was granted access to the 
hotel’s presidential or royal suite any time he wanted it whether he was 
performing at the hotel or not. Colonel Parker also was granted access to a 
room, which he used frequently because he had an appetite for gambling.
Respectful rivals: Elvis and The Beatles
Ever since The Beatles became a pop-culture 
sensation in the early 1960s, the press 
presented Elvis and The Beatles as rivals, but 
their professional relationship wasn’t that 
simple. The Beatles had long acknowledged the 
importance of Elvis as an influence, and Presley 
and the Colonel graciously sent a famous 
congratulatory telegram to The Beatles on 
the night of their first appearance on The Ed 
Sullivan Show.
On August 27, 1965, The Beatles visited Elvis at 
his home in California. Several of Elvis’s friends 
and companions were there, and each of them 
has told a different version of the interaction 
between Elvis and the Fab Four. Whatever hap-
pened, Elvis truly appreciated their talents 
despite any stories to the contrary. He sang two 
of their songs, “Yesterday” and “Hey Jude,” in 
his 1969 show at the International Hotel. (The 
section “Conquering Las Vegas” gives you a 
rundown of this infamous show.) In an article in 
Newsweek, which originated from the press 
conference Elvis gave after his opening night at 
the International, Presley freely discusses the 
talent of The Beatles: “There are a lot of new 
records out now that have the same sound I 
started. But they’re better. I mean you can’t 
compare a song like ‘Yesterday’ with ‘Hound 
Dog,’ can you?”

194
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road
Breaking records
For the rest of August 1969, Elvis continued to thrill audiences with the 
same level of energy and enthusiasm during his two shows every night. His 
engagement at the International Hotel broke all existing attendance records 
for all of Las Vegas, selling over 100,000 tickets and grossing more than $1.5 
million. In addition, the hotel’s income from other operations doubled during 
that month.
 
The International presented Elvis with a spectacular gift after his record-
breaking engagement — a huge gold belt with a belt buckle that read 
“World’s Championship Attendance Record, Las Vegas, Nevada, International 
Hotel.” The belt was made of gold over sterling silver, and it featured animal 
designs reminiscent of the signs of the zodiac. Elvis later added gems and 
precious stones to the belt and wore it regularly in concerts and during press 
conferences.
Returning to Las Vegas
On January 26, 1970, Elvis returned to the International for another month of 
sold-out performances. Dean Martin attended the opening night of Elvis’s 
second Las Vegas engagement. Elvis sang “Everybody Loves Somebody 
Sometime” as a tribute to Martin, the pop singer he had always admired. 
(Chapter 2 discusses more on Elvis’s initial influences.)
Elvis altered his repertoire for this engagement by emphasizing his current 
recordings and including some contemporary country and rock ballads. He 
limited the use of his older material to a few key places during the show, or 
he covered it in a medley-style arrangement. Elvis was determined not to rest 
on his laurels, so he focused his act on his new material and his new sound, 
which he had developed with the help of Chips Moman at the American 
Sound Studio. (Read more about his recordings with Moman in Chapter 11.)
The show was shortened this time around to half the time of his 1969 shows — 
about 40 minutes. Many people claim that the hotel requested Elvis to shorten 
the show because high rollers and other gamblers spent less time at the 
gaming tables whenever he was in town, but no evidence exists to support this. 
More likely, Elvis suffered from a condition known as “Vegas throat,” which is a 
sore throat caused by the dry desert air. Many entertainers contend with this 
condition when performing in Vegas, and Elvis probably shortened his act to 
ensure that his voice would last until the end of the engagement.
During this second engagement, Elvis wore a white jumpsuit for the first time 
on stage. Designed by Bill Belew, the costume was slashed down the front 
to reveal Elvis’s chest, fitted closely at the waist, and belled out at the legs, 
which was the fashion of the day. The costume’s high collar was inset with 

195
 Chapter 12: Viva Las Vegas: Returning to Live Performances
semiprecious jewels, and Elvis wore gold and diamond rings on the fingers of 
both hands. A macramé karate belt made of gold- and pearl-colored strands 
accentuated his slender waist. Throughout the rest of his career, Elvis most 
often wore variations of the jumpsuit, though they weren’t always white.
 
Elvis wasn’t merely a nostalgia act during his time in Vegas, but the success of 
his comeback was probably enhanced by the revival of 1950s music that 
began in the late 1960s. Many performers who had helped develop the rock ’n’ 
roll sound and attitude reaped the benefits of this renewed interest in the 
roots of rock music. Bill Haley and the Comets, Chuck Berry, and Jerry Lee 
Lewis all were touring again and attracting large crowds. Elvis’s success at 
this time not only benefited from the rock-nostalgia craze but undoubtedly 
influenced it. Yet, Elvis was careful to keep his material new and varied. He 
didn’t identify himself with the rock ’n’ roll revival, and his show was never 
considered to be merely an oldies act. In fact, even when he sang his hits from 
the 1950s, he used new arrangements to make them sound contemporary.
Taking His Show on the Road
Following his success in Las Vegas, Elvis took his act on tour. The singer 
realized that he had missed all facets of a music career. He missed the satis-
faction of recording material he believed in, and he missed the excitement of 
performing before a live audience. He wanted to perform for more than the 
two months he was engaged in Las Vegas, and he also wanted to reach out 
to fans who couldn’t make it to the desert city to see him. With a newfound 
purpose, Elvis asked the Colonel to book additional engagements.
Playing the Astrodome
For Elvis’s first show on the road, Colonel Parker arranged for him to appear 
in the Houston Astrodome in conjunction with the Texas Livestock Show, 
which ran from February 27 to March 1, 1970. The Colonel’s logic behind 
choosing this huge venue was simple: The livestock show would generate an 
audience regardless of whether Elvis was there or not, so they were guaran-
teed a built-in audience in case he didn’t draw the numbers he had in Vegas. 
But, in the end, the Colonel need not have worried, because all the Houston 
Astrodome shows were sold out.
 
Texas had always been good to Elvis. In 1955, East Texas had been the scene 
of a great surge of Elvis-mania, which helped boost his early career. To return 
this kindness (and perhaps to ensure a sellout), tickets for Elvis’s engagement 
at the Astrodome were greatly reduced in price, with some seats selling for as 
little as a dollar.

196
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road
Despite the boost in confidence from his Vegas victories, Elvis was over-
whelmed by the size of the Astrodome and the thought of having to please 
thousands of people. Referring to the Astrodome as an “ocean,” he worried 
about losing some of his energy and dynamism in such a vast arena. Again 
his fears proved unfounded because the Astrodome sold out each night of his 
engagement, and the local music critics raved about his personal charisma 
and exciting act.
 
Elvis’s evening show on Saturday, February 28, set a new record for the 
Astrodome with an audience of 43,614.
After the last of the six shows, Elvis held a press conference at AstroWorld, a 
Texas amusement park that closed in 2005 after 37 years in business. He 
answered questions from a horde of about 100 journalists. At the end of the 
press conference, he was awarded five gold records from RCA for material 
released in 1969, making him the only artist to date to win so many gold discs 
in one year.
 
The success in Houston inspired Elvis to continue touring, and his touring 
schedule quickly became grueling. By 1971, Elvis was on the road more than 
most other acts in show business. He would tour for three weeks at a time, 
taking no days off and doing two shows on Saturday and Sunday. He would 
rest for a few weeks and then repeat the cycle. Elvis usually played one-night 
stands, meaning every performance was scheduled for a different arena. Often 
Elvis and his entourage would arrive in a city and depart again in less than 24 
hours. Elvis’s concerts during this time were almost always sold out.
Going through a divorce
Elvis’s return to concert performing probably contributed to the disintegra-
tion of his marriage to Priscilla. Gone from Graceland much of the time while 
touring in concert, Elvis saw less of Priscilla and his daughter, Lisa Marie, as 
his career and lifestyle took a different direction. The horrendous pace of 
performing in a different city every night made traveling together difficult, 
and Elvis enforced a no-wives rule while on the road, which applied to 
himself and all members of the Memphis Mafia. In addition, like any rock act 
on tour, Elvis and his entourage didn’t always behave like mature family men.
Priscilla left Elvis in early 1972, and Elvis sued for divorce in August of that 
same year. Elvis’s lawyer succinctly summed up the problem when he 
released this statement: “Elvis has been spending six months a year on the 
road, which put a tremendous strain on the marriage.” In October 1973, the 
couple was officially divorced, but it was an amicable split. They held hands 
during the divorce proceedings and walked out of the courtroom arm in arm. 
Their complex feelings for each other are evident in the fact that neither of 
them ever married again.

E
lvis’s 1970s show was a far cry from his act in 1956 (see Chapter 3 for 
more information about Elvis’s 1956 act). Rather than a three-man 
combo, Elvis was backed by a rock band, an orchestra, a female vocal 
group, a soprano, and a gospel quartet. The scale of the sound befitted the 
nickname that the Colonel gave him: the World’s Greatest Entertainer.
Elvis rotated songs in and out of the act, but the grueling pace of his yearly 
schedule prohibited an extensive reworking of the show. By 1972, his act had 
settled into a series of patterns and rituals that was comforting and familiar 
to audiences. From the music to the costumes to the onstage routines, the 
Elvis Presley concert became a predictable and enjoyable experience. For 
most of the concert years, fans preferred the predictability, because they 
wanted to participate in concert rituals they knew were part of the show. 
Several of these routines were associated with key songs in the act and gave 
the illusion of intimacy between Elvis and his audience.
The interactive nature of the concerts in which gifts were bestowed, kisses 
exchanged, and emotions expressed can be compared to the rituals of 
romance. In effect, Elvis was romancing the female fans in the audience, and 
they were responding. Small wonder that Elvis’s fans are so loyal.
This chapter offers a detailed overview of the typical 1970s Elvis concert, 
including the musicians and singers, the music, the jumpsuits, and the fan 
interaction so those who never saw Elvis in concert can know what it was like 
and those who did see him can remember with nostalgia.

Introducing the Musicians Who 
Joined Elvis in Concert
For his return to concert performing, Elvis chose not to re-create his past by 
simply singing his old songs in a nostalgia-based act. He wanted a new sound 
for this new phase of his career. Elvis opted for a large-scale sound that 
required the contributions of a variety of musicians and singers, including a 
rock band, an orchestra, a gospel quartet, a soprano, and a soulful female 
vocal group. Each represents an important part of Elvis’s 1970s sound, which 
was a mixture of rock, pop, country and gospel, and soul or rhythm and 
blues. Once again his musical style represented an integration of genres, but 
his sound was still very different from his 1950s music.
 
In this section, Elvis’s extensive musical entourage takes center stage. Many 
had been influenced by Presley and in turn contributed to his later style and 
sound, reflecting the complexities of his music from this period.
Rock ’n’ rollers: The TCB Band
Formed in 1969 for Elvis’s comeback engagement at the International Hotel, 
the TCB Band backed the singer until he died. TCB stood for “Takin’ Care 
of Business,” which was Elvis’s motto, but this rock group was established 
before the phrase came about. Band leader James Burton assembled the 
group after Elvis called him personally in 1969 to ask for his help.
 
After Elvis died, the band recorded material for its own album, but it was 
never released. Then the band members went their separate ways until 1997, 
when the Elvis Presley Estate organized a tour called “Elvis: The Concert,” 
which consisted of film footage of Elvis performing onstage backed by the 
members of the TCB Band who played live. The tour was so successful that it 
has been remounted several times.
The core members of the TCB Band include some of the best musicians in 
rock ’n’ roll history. In the following sections, I honor these largely unsung 
musicians.
Lead guitarist James Burton
An accomplished and respected lead guitarist, James Burton got his profes-
sional start on the Louisiana Hayride as part of the staff band when he was 
only 14 years old. His stint on the Hayride came after Elvis’s tenure, so their 
paths didn’t cross. A few years later, Burton caught a break when he began 
playing lead guitar for Ricky Nelson. He backed Nelson on his major hits from 
1958 to 1965. During the 1960s, Burton did session work for several West 

199
 Chapter 13: Savoring Elvis in Concert
Coast musical acts, including the Beach Boys and Sonny & Cher, while also 
working as the lead guitarist in the house band for Shindig, a rock ’n’ roll 
television variety series.
Burton is still considered a rock ’n’ roll guitarist with considerable range, 
but his background in Southern sounds and styles made him a perfect choice 
as Elvis’s lead guitarist in the TCB Band. A hallmark of Elvis’s live shows 
occurred when he turned to James during the bridges of certain songs and 
said, “Play it, James,” and then Burton would solo.
 
Elvis was notorious for his humorous introductions of his band members 
and vocalists, once introducing Burton as “one of the funkiest chicken-pickin’ 
son-of-a-guns you ever met in your life.”
After Elvis died, Burton was a much sought-after musician, backing Merle 
Haggard, Gram Parsons, and Emmylou Harris, among others. His last major 
musical relationship was with John Denver, whom he backed off and on for 
16 years. Glen D. Hardin and Jerry Scheff, two other Elvis Presley band mem-
bers, also joined Denver’s band. Burton was elected to the Rock ’n’ Roll Hall 
of Fame in 2001. Today, he still serves the King by touring with “Elvis: The 
Concert.”
 
An unsubstantiated anecdote regarding Elvis and Burton reveals Presley’s 
regard for his lead guitarist. In 1974, Elvis met guitar legend Eric Clapton. In 
some versions of the story, Presley is unaware of the full extent of Clapton’s 
reputation as a “guitar god.” But, he offered to introduce Clapton to Burton so 
Eric could learn a thing or two about guitar playing.
Pianist Glen D. Hardin
Glen D. Hardin didn’t audition in 1969 to be one of the original band members 
for the International Hotel engagement. Instead, he replaced Larry Muhoberac 
as pianist in January 1970, playing on recordings and in concert with Elvis and 
the TCB Band until 1976.
A Texas native, Hardin first saw Elvis rocking the house in Lubbock in 1955. 
After his Navy service, Hardin joined the house band at the legendary Palomino 
Club in Hollywood, which specialized in West Coast country music. Buck 
Owens, Hoyt Axton, Willie Nelson, and Merle Haggard frequently played the 
club. He also toured with the Crickets, Buddy Holly’s old band, and then was 
hired as the piano player on Shindig, where he met James Burton and Jerry 
Scheff. He also worked as a session pianist for singers from Bing Crosby to 
Roy Orbison. Hardin also could arrange music, and he arranged several of 
Elvis’s large-scale numbers, including “Bridge Over Troubled Water” and 
“The Wonder of You.” Hardin left the show in 1976 to join Emmylou Harris, 
perhaps recognizing Elvis’s decline. Hardin’s diverse career is impressive. 
Most recently, he has played piano for outlaw country singer Travis Tritt.

200
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
 
As part of the house band on the television series Shindig, Hardin was in good 
company with many musicians who became an important part of the 1960s 
music scene, including Glen Campbell, Billy Preston, Delaney Bramlett, and 
Leon Russell. The band was first called the Shin-diggers, and then the name 
changed to the Shindogs.
Bass player Jerry Scheff
Jerry Scheff didn’t share the Southern background of many of the other TCB 
Band members. Instead the San Francisco–born bass player was steeped in 
West Coast jazz, and he actually began his career by playing the tuba. But, he 
did love the blues. He met guitarist James Burton when they were part of the 
Shindig house band together, and in 1966, he was a session musician on the 
soundtracks for Elvis’s movies Double Trouble and Easy Come, Easy Go.
During the 1960s, Scheff played on the recordings of Sammy Davis, Jr., Linda 
Ronstadt, Barbra Streisand, Pat Boone, Neil Diamond, and Dionne Warwick. 
When he was invited to audition to be Elvis Presley’s bass player, he wasn’t 
sure if he wanted the position until he met Elvis and the two jammed through 
a blues session. Except for a year or two, Scheff stayed with the TCB Band 
until Elvis died. When his time with Elvis was all over in 1977, he toured with 
several high-profile rock and pop acts, including Bette Midler, Bob Dylan, 
John Denver, and Elvis Costello.
Drummer Ronnie Tutt
Back in 1955, when Elvis was still a regionally based performer touring the 
country-western circuits across the South, a young Ronnie Tutt played on 
the same bill as the hip-swinging sensation. Tutt was a member of a western 
swing band, and his group opened for Elvis in the drummer’s hometown of 
Dallas. Little did he know that 14 years later he would audition to be part 
of Elvis’s comeback to live performances. Tutt claims that he won the audi-
tion over better-known drummers because he kept eye contact with Elvis 
while he sang. Though Tutt occasionally missed a tour or two, he remained 
the primary drummer of the TCB Band until Elvis died.
After playing for Elvis, Tutt worked for a number of singers and acts who 
represent a variety of musical styles, including Barbra Streisand, Johnny 
Cash, the Carpenters, the Beach Boys, Billy Joel, and Neil Diamond. Tutt 
has worked with Diamond for over two decades, remaining his primary 
drummer today.
 
In The Elvis Encyclopedia by Adam Victor, Ronnie Tutt recalls his approach 
to backing Elvis, “I emulated and accented everything that he did just instinc-
tively. Every move, almost like a glorified stripper! And he loved that.”
Rhythm guitarist John Wilkinson
As a child growing up in Missouri, rhythm guitarist John Wilkinson was an 
Elvis fan and a music prodigy. Like Ronnie Tutt and Glen D. Hardin, Wilkinson 

201
 Chapter 13: Savoring Elvis in Concert
experienced a minor brush with Elvis when the singer played in his home-
town in 1956. The 11-year-old boy spoke with Elvis backstage and brashly 
boasted he could play guitar better than the singer. He played a few licks for 
Elvis, who predicted that the two would cross paths again.
Actually, their paths crossed several times, because during the mid-1960s, 
Wilkinson worked as a session musician for RCA. He also was part of the 
folk-rock scene at the time, performing as one of the Kingston Trio and doing 
session work with Gordon Lightfoot and Peter, Paul and Mary. In 1969, Elvis 
himself called Wilkinson to join the TCB Band. After Elvis’s death, Wilkinson 
changed careers to work in the defense industry before a bout with bad 
health pushed him back into performing again on a small scale.
 
In 2006, Wilkinson wrote a book with friend and Tennessee author Nick 
Moretti titled My Life Before, During and After Elvis Presley.
Gospel singers J.D. Sumner 
and the Stamps Quartet
J.D. Sumner and the Stamps Quartet joined Elvis’s onstage act in November 
1971, replacing the Imperials. Elvis loved the harmonies of gospel groups 
and had employed a quartet to provide backing vocals since 1956 when he 
asked the Jordanaires to support him in concert and on his recordings. His 
continued use of a touch of gospel in his music throughout his career reveals 
the impact of this genre on his entire musical output.
Elvis had known Sumner since he was a teenager, because the gospel giant 
was a member of the Blackwood Brothers Quartet. The actual brothers in the 
quartet belonged to the same church as the Presleys. The members of the 
Blackwood Brothers Quartet were local Memphis heroes and frequently sang 
at the all-night gospel shows at Ellis Auditorium; Elvis was known to attend 
these shows (see Chapter 2 for details). According to Sumner, he often let 
Elvis in the back door for free, and when Elvis became famous in 1956, he let 
Sumner into his shows for free. Sumner and James Blackwood did a lot for 
gospel music, establishing the Gospel Music Association and the National 
Quartet Convention, which established the Dove Awards, one of the highest 
honors in the field.
Bass singer Sumner was inspired to go into the gospel field by the legendary 
Frank Stamps, and in 1965, he left the Blackwood Brothers to purchase the 
Stamps Quartet name. He and the Stamps sang with Elvis from 1971 to 1977. 
In 1978, J.D. Sumner and the Stamps Quartet released an album as a tribute to 
Elvis, which was titled Elvis’s Favorite Gospel Songs. He further paid tribute 
to his friend and associate in his book Elvis: His Love for Gospel Music, which 
was published in 1991.

202
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
After Elvis’s death, Sumner disbanded the Stamps to sing in a gospel super-
group called the Masters V with another of Elvis’s idols, Jake Hess. He 
re-formed the Stamps in 1988, and the group often performed at Elvis-related 
events. Sumner died in 1998, and the Stamps name was passed on to one of 
his associates. The quartet still performs albeit in a different configuration 
than during the Elvis days.
 
Elvis loved Sumner’s deep rich bass and often commented or joked about it 
onstage. Sumner once held the world’s record for the lowest recorded note, 
which was a double low C during the song “Blessed Assurance,” which is 
featured on the albums Thank God for Kids and The Wait Is Over.
Female vocal group, the Sweet 
Inspirations
The beginnings of the Sweet Inspirations go back to the 1960s at Atlantic 
Records when its members served as the label’s house vocalists, singing 
backup on songs by Aretha Franklin, Dionne Warwick, Wilson Pickett, Gene 
Pitney, and Van Morrison. Known simply as the Group, the original members 
included Cissy Houston, Doris Troy, and Dee Dee Warwick.
 
Cissy Houston is the mother of Grammy-winning singer Whitney Houston. Dee 
Dee Warwick is Cissy’s niece and younger sister of singer Dionne Warwick.
By 1968, they were calling themselves the Sweet Inspirations after their most 
famous song, “Sweet Inspiration.” At that time, the group included Houston, 
Sylvia Shemwell, Myrna Smith, and Estelle Brown. The group joined Elvis’s 
Seeing Elvis in concert today
Produced by Stig Edgren, “Elvis: The Concert” 
uses modern technology to wed film footage of 
Elvis singing onstage while his backup musi-
cians and vocalists perform live. The purpose is 
to re-create as closely as possible the experi-
ence of Elvis in concert. The footage was 
selected from Elvis — That’s the Way It Is, 
Aloha from Hawaii, and Elvis on Tour. (See 
Chapter 14 for more on these documentaries 
and programs.) Edgren removed all the music 
from the footage except for Elvis’s voice. During 
the concert, three large digital video screens 
project the footage of Elvis singing, while the 
TCB Band, an orchestra, the Stamps Quartet, 
and the Sweet Inspirations perform live. The 
middle and largest screen shows Elvis and 
the band members from the original footage. 
The side screens show the band members and 
vocalists playing and singing in the present. To 
make the experience seem more immediate, 
Elvis “interacts” with the band members in the 
present day. For example, Elvis introduces a 
band member in the 1970s and that person is 
shown on one screen as a young man and on 
another screen taking a bow in the present.

act in 1969 when he hired them sight unseen after hearing their signature 
song. In 1970, Houston left the group and was replaced by Ann Williams. The 
Sweets, as they were nicknamed, stayed with Elvis until the end. In recent 
years, the Sweet Inspirations have reunited to join “Elvis: The Concert.”
 
Interviewed for Elvis Up Close by Rose Clayton and Dick Heard, Smith believed 
that Elvis added their group to his act “because he wanted the spice of soul, 
but he didn’t want it to be overbearing,” which could be said of all the parts of 
his 1970s musical style.
Soprano Kathy Westmoreland
Westmoreland represented the opposite end of the musical scale from bass 
singer J.D. Sumner, because she was a soprano with an extremely high range. 
She joined Elvis’s act in 1970, replacing the previous soprano after she left 
unexpectedly during the middle of the Vegas engagement. Westmoreland 
thought she would be onboard for only two weeks, but she ended up staying 
with the show until Elvis died. She was a classically trained opera singer who 
had little experience with rock ’n’ roll. Of course, that changed when she 
joined Elvis’s musical entourage. Westmoreland sang backup with the rest of 
the singers on some songs, but she was added to the mix for certain ballads 
in which she sang a brief solo between Elvis’s verses. During the show, if the 
audience seemed to be restless, Elvis often asked Westmoreland to sing a 
solo. Her angelic voice soothed the audience and helped to settle them down. 
After Elvis died, Westmoreland continued to perform but without the success 
of some of the other members of Elvis’s onstage entourage.
 
Westmoreland, who had a personal relationship with Elvis at one time, 
wrote a book defending his final years. Titled Elvis and Kathy, the book was 
published in 1987.
Orchestra director Joe Guercio
Joe Guercio, the director of the orchestra at the International Hotel, 
impressed Elvis when the singer performed there in 1970. So Colonel Parker 
made an arrangement with the hotel to have Guercio travel with Elvis on the 
road, along with an orchestra made up of more than 20 musicians. Guercio 
developed the orchestral arrangements for Elvis’s songs, and he also 
arranged the singer’s dramatic entrance onstage to the strains of the theme 
song from the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey. The orchestra added depth 
and scale to Elvis’s music and provided a smoothness for the ballads and pop 
tunes that were an integral part of the act.
 
Loyal to the end, Guercio arranged and conducted the music for Elvis’s 
funeral. (Refer to Chapter 15 for more details on Elvis’s funeral.)

Examining the Music: Uniquely Elvis
In early 1969, Elvis recorded a critically acclaimed album, From Elvis in 
Memphis, which revealed a new, vibrant style. Drowning in mediocre sound-
track albums, he had lost his cache in the music industry, but this new album 
reminded everyone that he was still a powerful interpreter of popular music. 
The songs from that album plus other material recorded around the same 
time yielded several singles that charted well. (You can read more informa-
tion on From Elvis in Memphis in Chapter 11.)
The material for the album and singles was written by a new generation of 
Southern songwriters and musicians who had grown up listening to Elvis and 
rock ’n’ roll during the 1950s. Their style wasn’t traditional country nor did it 
sound like the West Coast rock that was dominating the charts. Sometimes 
called “swamp rock,” this regional-tinged style influenced Elvis’s sound 
during the 1970s, as did the music of African American R&B singers, called 
“soul music” at the time.
 
However, Elvis’s music during the final phase of his career consisted of much 
more than just these Southern-based influences. His taste had always been 
eclectic, even when he was a young man, and this still proved true during 
the 1970s. For his live act, his song selection included contemporary rock ’n’ 
roll, contemporary country rock, traditional country and gospel, R&B, and 
pop. More importantly, his sound seemed to fuse these styles together into 
something that was completely unique to Elvis. In other words, while it’s easy 
to hear the influences of all these musical genres in Elvis’s sound, you also can 
immediately recognize that sound as his style. Presley’s song selection for his 
live act combined new material that he had recorded himself with standards 
or contemporary songs associated with a variety of other singers.
Elvis’s sound was intense, hard driving, and large scale, and when he per-
formed his music onstage, he was dramatic and theatrical. On the surface, 
his sound and performing style seem nothing like the Elvis Presley of the 
1950s on the surface, but similarities do exist. For instance, during the 1970s, 
Elvis sang a unique blend of musical styles and genres, and he performed 
onstage with much flair and drama — a fair description of his 1950s music 
and performing style.
Using a sampling of songs from his 1970s concerts, this section explores 
Elvis’s music from this highly recognizable but often maligned phase of 
his career.
Revamping old favorites
In his concerts, Elvis sang several of his hits from the 1950s and a few tunes 
from his films in the 1960s, but unlike other pioneering rock ’n’ rollers from 

205
 Chapter 13: Savoring Elvis in Concert
the era, he didn’t ride the nostalgia train. Instead, he used different arrange-
ments for his past hits, or he relegated these songs to specific parts of the 
show to give them different connotations.
 
Elvis was an excellent judge of what his audience wanted to hear, and he knew 
they would want to hear his hits. After all, his 1950s tunes changed the course 
of music history. But Elvis also loved music too much not to want to update 
his style and sound. It wasn’t part of his nature to rest on the laurels of his 
past. Here are some examples of how he used his old songs:
 
✓ “Love Me Tender” became a valentine to the fans.
 
✓ “Teddy Bear” became an opportunity for Elvis to throw souvenirs into 
the audience.
 
✓ “Can’t Help Falling in Love” was a signal that the show had come to 
an end.
 
✓ “Hound Dog,” “Heartbreak Hotel,” “Don’t Be Cruel,” “Love Me,” and other 
rock ’n’ roll classics were generally sung as a medley with different 
arrangements than the originals.
Performing the new singles
Between 1969 and 1972, Elvis released several successful singles that charted 
well. This magnitude of success hadn’t occurred for the singer since the early 
1960s. Some of these new tunes had been recorded at American Sound Studio 
in early 1969, a session that had produced the critically acclaimed album 
From Elvis in Memphis. (Refer to Chapter 11 for more information on the 
songs recorded at American Sound.)
 
Elvis’s successful singles from this period, which became an essential part of 
his act, include the following:
 
✓ “If I Can Dream” was specially written to close The ’68 Comeback 
Special. It was a song close to Elvis’s heart, and he sang it with great 
conviction and emotion. The song was released as a single in November 
1968 and reached number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. (I discuss 
The ’68 Comeback Special in more detail in Chapter 11.)
 
✓ “In the Ghetto,” which was recorded at American Sound Studio on 
January 20, 1969, was released in April 1969 and charted at number 
three. The song was part of his playlist when he debuted at the 
International Hotel in the summer of 1969, and it remains an audience 
favorite.
 
✓ “Suspicious Minds,” like “In the Ghetto,” was recorded at American 
Sound in January 1969, and it formed the centerpiece of his concert act. 
The song was released as a single in August 1969 and topped the charts 
at number one.

206
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
 
✓ “Burning Love,” which was recorded in Hollywood at RCA’s Studio C in 
1972, has always been a fan favorite, though Elvis supposedly didn’t like 
the song. It reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
Move over Paul Simon: “Bridge 
Over Troubled Water”
Elvis recorded Paul Simon’s chart-topping hit, “Bridge Over Troubled Water” 
in 1970, the same year that the singing duo Simon and Garfunkel released it. 
The song features a spiritual tone that appealed to Elvis, and it became 
another number that he performed with conviction when he sang it live. He 
performed the song regularly between 1970 and 1974, and then he sang it 
only occasionally after that.
Like many of Elvis’s songs, “Bridge Over Troubled Water” starts slow and 
quiet and then builds to a dramatic conclusion. Elvis liked the melodrama of 
ballads and the theatricality of ending on a grand scale. He also had a way of 
making someone else’s song his own, because he selected material that he 
had an emotional connection to. Simon had written and arranged the song to 
start slow and build, but Art Garfunkel’s high voice is smooth and cool in 
comparison to Elvis’s vocals, which are filled with passion and pain.
 
In 1986, Simon released an album that featured an eclectic mix of American 
rock, zydeco, and Tex-Mex with South African sounds, including the music of 
Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Inspired by his visit to Elvis’s home, Simon titled 
the album Graceland. Besides its title, the fusion of genres and sounds of white 
and black music on the album also is reminiscent of Elvis’s music.
Remembering swamp rock: 
“Polk Salad Annie”
Elvis’s version of “Polk Salad Annie,” which was originally written by 
Southern rocker Tony Joe White, was recorded while he was performing 
onstage at the International in February 1970. Funky, sexy, and low down, 
the song was the epitome of swamp rock, a Southern-style rock ’n’ roll.
The song was filled with Southern slang and cultural references that must 
have made mainstream audiences curious. The title made reference to an 
herb known in the South as pokeweed, poke, pokebush, pokeberry, pokeroot, 
polk salad, or polk sallet. Polk salad grows from one to ten feet tall in the 
wild and features single alternative leaves with crinkled edges. The stems 
are generally red, the flowers white, and the berries purple. The berries are 
poisonous, but the leaves can be cooked and served as greens. In the song, 
the singer claims he needs a “mess of it,” meaning he desires a serving of it 
for a meal.

207
 Chapter 13: Savoring Elvis in Concert
Later in the song, listeners hear a reference to “stealing watermelons from a 
truck patch,” which is a small, rudimentary garden filled with vegetables and 
crops for a family’s personal consumption (as opposed to a floral garden or a 
garden of produce to sell). Elsewhere the lyrics include “tote” to mean carry 
and “tote sack” to refer to a bag to hold valuables and possessions.
“Polk Salad Annie” allowed Elvis to revel in his Southern heritage, and he 
enjoyed performing it live, especially the musical exchanges with his band 
and the Sweet Inspirations.
Singin’ a song about the Southland: 
“An American Trilogy”
In 1971, country songwriter Mickey Newbury put together a unique arrange-
ment of three 19th century songs, which he recorded and released as “An 
American Trilogy.” Elvis heard the record and immediately incorporated the 
trilogy into his act for 1972. The piece has become so associated with Elvis 
Presley that it’s difficult to imagine anyone else performing it with the same 
showstopping fervor that Elvis always did.
A combination of the Southern anthem “Dixie,” Julia Ward Howe’s abolitionist 
song “The Battle Hymn of the Republic,” and the spiritual “All My Trials,” the 
medley reflects Elvis’s deep-felt patriotism, his religious convictions, and his 
deep affection for and innate understanding of his native South.
Backed with “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,” “An American Trilogy” 
was released as a single in April 1972 at Elvis’s insistence, but it struggled to 
sell even 100,000 copies. And, it never climbed higher than number 66 on the 
Billboard charts. But, the song is a perfect example of the difference between 
Elvis’s live performances and his recordings. The song became a high point 
of the show when he performed it in concert with passion and conviction, 
but the record lacks the same level of expression.
 
Critics from the North and some music historians have failed to understand 
the significance of “An American Trilogy,” which expressed the complexities 
of the South. Unable to accept the medley’s overt sentiment, they speculate 
that Newbury had intended the piece to be ironic, or that Elvis, who was 
politically conservative, was simplistically patriotic. Many of these commenta-
tors fail to research the origins of the three songs that make up the trilogy. 
For Elvis, whose music symbolized the very essence of racial integration, the 
medley was a heartfelt expression of the history of his native South. Anyone 
who has heard his melancholy interpretation of “Dixie” and the dramatic 
grandeur of the trilogy’s conclusion with “Battle Hymn” knows that it wasn’t 
intended to be ironic or an expression of conservative values.

Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
Pondering the Priscilla Songs
Elvis and Priscilla separated in 1972, and they were divorced the following 
year. Even though they remained close and both moved on to different 
romantic interests, it proved to be a difficult time for Elvis. When Elvis and 
Priscilla began to grow apart, he included several songs about the trials and 
tribulations of life and love into his act:
 
✓ “Always on My Mind”
 
✓ “Separate Ways”
 
✓ “Funny How Time Slips Away”
 
✓ “You Gave Me a Mountain”
These new additions began around the spring of 1972, when he recorded 
“Separate Ways,” “You Gave Me a Mountain,” and “Always on My Mind.” Fans 
interpreted these songs as a reflection of his marital woes, and they referred 
to them as the “Priscilla Songs.” Even though he had been singing “Always on 
My Mind” since his return to live performances, in context with these other 
ballads, it took on the connotation of a Priscilla Song. More ballads about 
broken hearts and lost love would follow over the next couple of years; these 
songs, too, would be dubbed Priscilla Songs by fans.
During the Vegas engagement in 1972, as well as on the tours, Elvis didn’t 
joke between numbers as he had in previous years, and the contact with the 
audience was kept to a minimum. The reason was undoubtedly Elvis’s marital 
problems and subsequent breakup with Priscilla. The Vegas engagement, 
which ran from January 26 through February 23, suffered the most because 
Priscilla and Lisa Marie left Graceland and moved to Los Angeles on the last 
day of the engagement. Just after that, Elvis was admitted to the hospital for 
exhaustion.
 
Elvis never wrote a song, but his artistry and autobiography came through in 
his selection of material. Even though it’s too simplistic to draw a cause-and-
effect conclusion between Elvis’s song selection in 1972 and his separation 
from Priscilla, his choice of material over the years is indirectly reflective of 
moods and feelings he was unable to vocalize any other way.
Singing it his way
Elvis began singing “My Way” onstage in the summer of 1972. Singer-songwriter 
Paul Anka had penned the lyrics for this powerful song, which is about a man 
reflecting on his life as death draws near. Anka adapted “My Way” from a 
French love song called “Come d’Habitude,” which he had heard on a visit to 

209
 Chapter 13: Savoring Elvis in Concert
Paris in 1969. He gave the song to Frank Sinatra when the singer asked Anka if 
he had any new material to record. Sinatra enjoyed a huge hit with the song, 
selling more than a million copies of the single.
 
The song became a personal anthem for Elvis — one that seemed to explain 
his eccentric lifestyle and larger-than-life image. A single release of this song 
by Elvis wasn’t distributed until June 1977 — two months before he died.
Appreciating the Significance 
of All the King’s Jumpsuits
More than anything else, the white bejeweled jumpsuit has come to repre-
sent the Vegas era of Elvis’s career. No more powerful icon exists in the 
world of Elvis; this single image at once connotes magnificent grandeur and 
gaudy excess — depending on whether you like this period of Elvis’s career. 
To some, a jumpsuit-clad Elvis symbolizes the large-scale sound, theatrics, 
larger-than-life gestures, and dramatic performance style associated with 
this era; to others, it suggests a phony Vegas performer defined by his 
excesses — too many rhinestones, too much food, and too many drugs.
So much myth and misinformation and so many preconceived ideas surround 
the jumpsuits that it’s difficult for many to read about them with an open 
mind. Yet Elvis’s fans have long been fascinated by the jumpsuits, particu-
larly the designs, which are not only intricate but also iconographic. Some of 
the designs represent Elvis’s interests, values, personal tastes, and even 
moods. Elvis asked costumer Bill Belew to come up with a new jumpsuit 
design for every major tour, or at least for every year, so when looking at 
concert footage or photos, fans can estimate the year based on the jumpsuit 
and interpret the iconography to discover something new about him.
 
Elvis left behind no autobiography or definitive interview. Indeed, his personal 
life, values, and beliefs were hidden from the press and public at the Colonel’s 
suggestion. Much that has been written about him has been through the point 
of view or personal perspective of others, leaving fans to search for creative 
ways to uncover Elvis’s true feelings and beliefs. Considering his song selec-
tion at certain points in his life, as mentioned earlier in the chapter, and 
interpreting the designs of the jumpsuits offer a tiny window in the life of the 
man in the jumpsuit.
In this section, I discuss the origin of Elvis’s jumpsuit and cover some 
insights into the iconography of the most famous of the King’s costumes.

210
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
Designing the first jumpsuit
Just before his second engagement at the International Hotel in January 
and February of 1970, Elvis asked costume designer Bill Belew to design a 
comfortable onstage ensemble that would allow him to move freely onstage. 
Belew had designed the black leather outfit the singer wore for the live 
segments of The ’68 Comeback Special, and both Elvis and Priscilla admired 
his work, so it was natural that Elvis would work with the designer again. 
(I describe the karate suit costume that Elvis wore for the first engagement 
in Chapter 11.)
For the Vegas engagement, Belew designed a white wool gabardine jumpsuit 
that was slashed down the front, fitted tight at the waist, and belled out at 
the legs, which was the fashion of the day. The costume’s high Napoleonic 
collar was inset with semiprecious jewels, and a macramé karate belt made of 
gold- and pearl-colored strands accentuated the singer’s slender waist.
Compared with the later costumes that Belew designed for Elvis’s Las Vegas 
appearances and tours, this first jumpsuit was modest. As the years passed 
and Elvis’s stage show grew in scope and scale, his costumes became more 
and more elaborate, even flamboyant. The jumpsuits were often accompanied 
by waist-length or even floor-length capes lined with brightly colored silk.
 
According to friends and family, the gems and gold chains and rivets that 
decorated these costumes were real and could make the jumpsuit weigh as 
much as 30 pounds. Simply standing up in such a heavy costume could be 
physically exhausting, but Elvis generally didn’t stand still. Instead, he moved 
quickly and gracefully across the stage under hot lights, causing him to per-
spire and wear out quickly. As the act became more theatrical, and the jump-
suits more elaborate and thus heavier, the show became shorter in length.
Considering the jumpsuits 
as autobiography
Elvis’s costumes, particularly the belts, were often emblazoned with symbols 
that had personal significance to Elvis. These motifs include eagles, karate 
symbols, peacocks, tigers, and sundials. The singer’s fans refer to his cos-
tumes by name: the Mexican Sundial, the King of Spades, the Rainbow Swirl, 
the American Eagle, the Red Flower, the Gypsy, or the Dragon. While not 
every jumpsuit is rife with personal iconography, many of them do reveal 
something of interest about Elvis. I explain the meanings behind some of his 
most famous costumes in the following sections.

211
 Chapter 13: Savoring Elvis in Concert
The Burning Love
Elvis wore a bright red jumpsuit onstage during the fall of 1972, which the 
fans dubbed the Burning Love jumpsuit, partly because of its color and partly 
because Elvis incorporated the song “Burning Love” into his act that year.
The all-red jumpsuit may be the boldest color of all Elvis’s costumes, and he 
elected to wear it during a particularly emotional time when his marriage was 
falling apart. Drawing cause-and-effect conclusions are too simplistic, and I 
will refrain from doing that in this case, but it is a curious color even by 
Elvis’s standards.
 
Some confusion exists over the Burning Love jumpsuit because another of 
Elvis’s costumes was also given the same name. Elvis wore a white costume 
and cape for one of the shows during the Madison Square Garden engagement, 
and a photo of him in this ensemble appeared on the front of the album 
Burning Love, and Hits from His Movies, Volume 2, which is the reason the 
white-and-gold ensemble was christened with that name. But over time, the 
red suit usurped the nickname.
 
Elvis donated the red suit to the National Cerebral Palsy Telethon in 1972. In 
1995, the suit resurfaced at a Las Vegas auction and sold for $107,000.
Aloha from Hawaii (also known as the Aloha Eagle)
The landmark television special Elvis: Aloha from Hawaii was telecast live to 
several countries via satellite on January 14, 1973. (See Chapter 14 for more 
information.) Elvis was amazed at the satellite technology that allowed him to 
sing before so many foreign countries at the same time, and he attributed it 
to American ingenuity. So, because he was proud of his country, Elvis wanted 
a costume that shouted “America” to the worldwide audiences.
For this show, Belew produced a white jumpsuit with an American eagle pat-
terned in red, gold, and blue gems. The costume’s spectacular calf-length 
cape proved too cumbersome in rehearsals, so Elvis asked Belew to modify it 
to a hip-length cape. A belt decorated with gold American eagles accented 
the ensemble.
Aside from the iconography that revealed Elvis’s passion for his country, this 
costume has become legendary because in a burst of excitement over the 
crowd’s enthusiasm, Elvis threw both the belt and the cape into the cheering 
audience near the end of the show. He ordered a second belt and cape to 
replace those so he could continue using the costume that year. The cape 
surfaced in a private collection during the 1990s.
 
By the end of 1974, Elvis stopped wearing capes onstage. Not only were they 
heavy, but members of the audience began grabbing the corners of the capes 
while he was performing, and he was in danger of falling offstage.

212
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
The Memphis
This white jumpsuit with an abstract design was named the Memphis in 
honor of Elvis’s hometown. He wore the suit when he opened his 1974 tour 
in Memphis, marking the first time Elvis performed in his hometown since 
1961. Oddly, Elvis had worn this suit during his August 1973 Las Vegas 
engagement, so it wasn’t new to the 1974 tour. However, it is a reminder of 
how much Elvis loved Memphis, the only place he could truly escape the 
pressures of his enormous stardom. The suit is also called the King by fans.
The Tiger
Elvis wore the Tiger jumpsuit, also called the Mad Tiger, around 1973 or 1974. 
This white jumpsuit with a high collar sported an open V-neck, flared sleeves, 
and belled pant legs. The dominant design was a jumping tiger, which 
wrapped around the front of the suit from the bottom left to the top right. 
The suit was accented with tiger stripes down the sides of the legs, on the 
collar, and on the belt buckle.
 
Karate, which he picked up when he was in the army, became an important 
hobby to Elvis. He dabbled in the sport for 20 years, and his karate name was 
the Tiger.
The Peacock
Elvis wore the Peacock, which became one of his favorite jumpsuits, during 
a 1974 tour. A white jumpsuit with a V-neck and high collar, the Peacock 
features a large blue and gold bird rendered in a stylized design on the front 
and back. The birds were hand embroidered with gold thread. Blue stylized 
peacock feathers fell down the sides of the pant legs, and the belt included 
gold medallions that alternated with motifs that resembled the eye of a 
peacock feather.
A religious person, Elvis believed in an afterlife, and he knew that in some 
cultures, the peacock symbolizes eternal life. For that reason, he was capti-
vated by the birds for a while. At one time he even kept a few live peacocks 
around Graceland. Inside the house, a peacock design can be found on the 
stained-glass windows that separate the living room from the music room. 
(To read more about the rooms of Graceland, flip to Chapter 19.)
 
The Peacock was the most expensive jumpsuit ever made for Elvis, costing the 
singer more than $10,000. In recent years, the Peacock sold at auction for 
$300,000.
The Bear Claw
Also known as the Sabre Tooth, this navy-colored jumpsuit offers a variation 
on the V-neck, flared-sleeve design. The Bear Claw features a scoop neck and 
baby blue puffy sleeves. The suit is decorated with designs similar to those 
found in Native American arts. The dominant motif is the bear’s claw. 

213
 Chapter 13: Savoring Elvis in Concert
Simulated bear claws encircle the neck like a necklace and adorn the front of 
the suit as well as the flared area of the pant legs. Elvis wore this suit on tour 
in 1975 and 1976.
Other jumpsuits
The following list of jumpsuits reveals a variety of colors and designs, belying 
the stereotype that Elvis wore only white jumpsuits:
 
✓ Green Cisco Kid (1971)
 
✓ The Blue Swirl (1972)
 
✓ The Adonis (1972)
 
✓ The Tiffany (1972)
 
✓ The Black Conquistador (1974)
 
✓ The Dragon (1974)
 
✓ The Blue Rainbow (1974)
 
✓ American Eagle (1974, not to be 
confused with the Aloha from Hawaii jumpsuit)
 
✓ The Black Phoenix (1975)
 
✓ The Red Phoenix (1975 and 1976)
 
✓ Indian Feather (1975)
 
✓ The Sun Dial (1976 and 1977)
 
✓ The Gypsy (1976)
Check out the color photo section in this book for a look at the Black 
Conquistador and other jumpsuits.
 
Costume designer Bill Belew revealed that just before Elvis died, the two of 
them had come up with a new twist on the old jumpsuits. Belew recalls in Elvis 
Up Close by Rose Clayton and Dick Heard, “There was a new look in develop-
ment for Elvis. We had literally gone as far as we could with the jewels and the 
embroidery work, and I was working on this new idea: It was a costume with 
lasers. Between the spotlights hitting the jewels and the lasers coming from 
the suit, it would have really been spectacular.”
Ritualizing the Experience
The typical Presley concert of the 1970s was more like a series of rituals and 
ceremonies than a performance by a mere entertainer. Elvis engaged in 
dramatic actions and gestures throughout the concert, which were emotive, 

214
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
expressive, and therefore exciting to the audiences. Similarly, specific songs 
signaled certain behaviors that fans looked forward to, especially those 
involving interaction between the singer and the audience.
The interaction between Elvis and audience members while he was onstage 
gave the illusion of intimacy, which is the key to the Presley concert 
experience. Treating the concert and its routines like a ceremony created 
a close bond among audience members, even if there were thousands of 
them. And engaging in the rituals with Elvis cemented a connection between 
fan and performer that has lasted decades. Sometimes, his rapport with 
his audiences was like a conversation among a gathering of old friends; other 
times, it took the form of romantic flirtation. In this section, I discuss the 
interactions, routines, and rituals associated with the typical 1970s Elvis 
concert.
 
When Elvis played the International, which became the Las Vegas Hilton in 
1971, most fans didn’t come for only one performance; they booked rooms for 
a week or even two and attended both shows every night for the duration of 
their stay. Every one of Elvis’s Vegas engagements was sold out far in advance, 
and the International made about $1.5 million per engagement. Waiters and 
maitre d’s were tipped heavily for the best seats in the house, which was 
money they split among themselves. During Elvis’s engagement, the tip 
amount was never less than $10,000 per night. No other Vegas entertainer 
commanded that level of fan devotion.
Making an entrance
The Elvis experience began with the singer’s grand entrance onstage. Early 
on, from about 1969 to 1971, his entrance was modest as he strolled briskly 
onto the stage and then ripped into “All Shook Up” or “That’s All Right” for 
his first song.
But, as his act became more grandiose, he needed a more flamboyant 
entrance. So, in 1971, he created a new entrance: As Joe Guercio’s orchestra 
played Richard Strauss’s Also Sprach Zarathustra, popularly known as the 
“Theme from 2001,” Elvis charged into the spotlight as though propelled by 
some supernatural force. He then launched into the first song, which was 
permanently changed to “See See Rider” in 1972. This entrance and opening 
song remained unchanged for the rest of his career.
Exchanging gifts and tossing underwear
Much of the interaction that occurred between audience members and Elvis 
while he was onstage was comparable to exchanging “gifts.” Elvis threw 
towels, scarves, and flowers into the audience; fans returned the gesture by 
throwing teddy bears, bouquets of roses, and other mementos.

215
 Chapter 13: Savoring Elvis in Concert
The most intriguing part of this ritual was performed by members of the 
audience. Each time Elvis played Las Vegas, the hotel stocked fresh undergar-
ments in the restrooms because the women liked to throw them onto the 
stage while he was performing. Occasionally, they threw the keys to their 
hotel rooms as well.
More peculiar parts of Elvis’s act included him wiping the sweat from his 
brow and throwing the scarf or towel into the audience. As the years passed, 
this gesture became such a popular ritual that dozens of white towels were 
kept on hand so Elvis could throw them into the audience at frequent inter-
vals. Charlie Hodge, one of Elvis’s closest friends who played rhythm guitar 
onstage, was in charge of placing new scarves or towels around his neck. 
Fans coveted these scarves because they were actually worn by Elvis, even if 
only for a few seconds.
 
Elvis occasionally got carried away with the ritualized exchange of gifts and 
tossed expensive rings or his jewel-encrusted belts into audience. At least 
once, he threw his cape into the crowd (see the earlier section “Aloha from 
Hawaii” for details).
Romancing his audience
Elvis resurrected his 1956 hit “Love Me Tender” for his 1970s act. Eventually, 
the song became a sort of valentine to the fans in that Elvis kissed, hugged, 
and held hands with many of the women in the audience while he sang the 
song. As soon as the audience heard the opening notes to this ballad, they 
lined up just below the stage like a receiving line for royalty, waiting to be 
blessed by the King’s touch. In effect, Elvis was courting the women in the 
audience with the illusion of physical affection and tokens of his esteem.
This type of interaction can be traced back to Elvis’s early career, when 
audiences became hysterical at his gyrations and performing style. Even 
then, Elvis exhibited an uncanny instinct for knowing what the fans wanted 
to see and hear; however, during the 1950s, the effect was akin to sexual 
attraction rather than romance. He teased them with a few hip and leg move-
ments, they responded, and then he cut loose, singling out specific members 
of the audience to interact with. This phenomenon was also reciprocal in 
nature, forming a strong bond between performer and audience. If Elvis’s 
fans were unusually loyal and demonstrative throughout his career, this 
interactive aspect of his act — from the beginning of his career to the end — 
was partially responsible.
 
Elvis said this about performing live: “A live concert to me is exciting because 
of all the electricity that is generated in the crowd and onstage. It’s my favorite 
part of the business — live concerts.”

Dramatizing his act
When Elvis was particularly caught up in the music during a concert, he 
incorporated karate kicks and tai chi arabesques as well as other dramatic 
gestures, stances, and moves into his performance. During the years he wore 
a cape onstage, he was fond of taking the ends of the cape in both hands and 
lifting it into the air, spreading the cape like angel wings. Sometimes he even 
dropped to one knee. Elvis liked the effect because it was quite theatrical and 
stirred the audience. At other times, he shook his body in time to the music, 
raised his hands in striking poses, and prowled back and forth across the 
stage. See Figure 13-1 for a shot of Elvis performing during this time.
From his first moments onstage Elvis had always moved dramatically, partly 
because of his nervous energy and partly because it roused the audience. 
During the 1950s, his constant need to move took the form of his controver-
sial hip and leg gyrations, which were sexual and sensual. Looking back 
at those moves, they were no less dramatic than the karate kicks, hand 
gestures, and body quivers of the 1970s. Some movements and mannerisms 
stayed consistent from the 1950s to the 1970s, particularly the way he shook 
his leg to keep time to the pulsing, fast-paced music.

Leaving the building
During the 1970s, a Vegas-style comedian always opened Elvis’s concerts. 
Rock music aficionados were appalled by the old-fashioned routines and 
stale jokes of these stand-up comics, particularly because they saw the rise 
of a new, more hip generation of comedians with socially relevant material. 
But, even when he was on the cutting edge of rock ’n’ roll in 1956 and 1957, 

217
 Chapter 13: Savoring Elvis in Concert
Elvis always toured with an oddball assortment of vaudeville-flavored acts 
dug up by his manager, Colonel Parker. It seems only natural that the Colonel 
would hire this type of opening act when Elvis returned to live performances 
in the 1970s. Elvis and the Colonel were accustomed to this kind of show 
business act, and the humor went over well in Vegas. Sammy Shore opened 
for Elvis in the early 1970s, and Jackie Kahane did the honors after 1972.
 
Kahane’s responsibilities as the comic relief included letting the audience 
know when it was time to leave the auditorium. Elvis rarely performed an 
encore, though many times the audience remained behind after the final 
number hoping Elvis would respond to the thunderous applause and return 
for one last song. However, to avoid any problems with overzealous fans, Elvis 
always ran backstage immediately after the last song, often while the band 
was still playing, and dashed into a car waiting at the stage door. Kahane then 
let the audience know that it was truly time to leave. Little did Elvis, Kahane, 
or anyone else connected with the Presley show realize that this closing 
moment would become one of pop culture’s most infamous catch phrases: 
“Ladies and gentlemen, Elvis has left the building.”

A
fter Elvis returned to live performances in 1969, he enjoyed several 
unique career highlights. From about 1970 to 1973, his return to the 
stage resulted in a stretch of sold-out crowds in Las Vegas, successful tours, 
and singular achievements unsurpassed by other entertainers. His accolades 
and accomplishments ranged from awards for his charitable donations to 
unprecedented engagements and one-of-a-kind performance venues.
Beyond these achievements, Elvis was respected by everyone from other 
Vegas entertainers to contemporary rock ’n’ rollers. His successful return 
to Vegas influenced the style of entertainment that audiences expected to 
see in America’s fun capital. Once dominated by smooth pop crooners, 
Las Vegas venues saw the rise of a different breed of singer with a large-
scale, rock-influenced sound, a sexier performance style, and a more glitzy 
presence.
 
In retrospect, Elvis’s years on tour and in concert in Vegas have taken on a 
negative connotation associated with his drug use, weight problems, health 
issues, and lifestyle of excess. Many assume that throughout the 1970s Elvis 
was considered an overweight, jumpsuited Vegas performer who appealed 
only to an unhip crowd of older women and working-class families. (See 
Chapter 17 for details about how this connotation evolved.) But, from 1970 
to 1973, this wasn’t true. A few bad notices aside, Elvis was considered a 
successful and respected entertainer in his public life throughout much of 
the 1970s, and this chapter details the highlights of this phase of his career.

220
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
Becoming an Outstanding Young Man
In January 1971, Elvis was officially named one of the Ten Outstanding Young 
Men of America of 1970 by the Junior Chamber of Commerce (otherwise 
known as the Jaycees). This honor touched him deeply, especially because 
the ceremony was scheduled to take place in Memphis that year. The Jaycees 
are a nationally based community group devoted to civic duty. Each year, the 
Jaycees consider several young men for this honor, usually under the age of 
40, who are prominent in their fields. Each name is suggested by a respected 
member of the community, and then a panel of distinguished judges makes 
the final decision. Memphis Sheriff Bill Morris, a friend of Elvis’s since his 
Tupelo days, sponsored his nomination. The judges in 1970, who included 
former President Lyndon B. Johnson, chose Elvis not simply because he was 
a famous entertainer but because of his many acts of philanthropy.
An awards ceremony was held at Ellis Auditorium in Memphis on January 15, 
which included a prayer breakfast, a luncheon, a press conference, and an 
evening ceremony. At the ceremony, George H.W. Bush, later President of the 
United States, served as the keynote speaker. Then each honoree gave a 
speech while accepting his award statue.
And the nominees are . . .
Elvis was in good company the year he was 
honored with the distinction of being one of the 
Jaycees’ Outstanding Young Men of America. 
The other recipients from 1970 included the 
following men:
 ✓ Thomas Atkins, an African American coun-
cilman from Boston who worked as a civil 
rights activist during that city’s tense racial 
problems of the late 1960s.
 ✓ Captain William Bucha, a Medal of Honor 
winner who became an expert on the 
Middle East. Bucha later went on to serve 
as a foreign policy advisor to President 
Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign.
 ✓ Dr. Mario Capecchi, a molecular geneticist 
who later was the cowinner of the 2007 
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
 ✓ Harry Cherry, a prominent businessman.
 ✓ Edward Thomas Coll, a humanitarian who 
committed his life to volunteer service.
 ✓ James B. Goetz, a radio broadcaster and 
regional media mogul who later became 
lieutenant governor of Minnesota.
 ✓ Walter Humann, a business leader who 
later held key positions in major corpora-
tions, including chairman of Memorex-
Telex and CEO of WJH Corporation.
 ✓ Dr. George Todaro, a medical researcher 
who later worked with the National Cancer 
Institute.
 ✓ Ron Ziegler, the White House Press 
Secretary during President Richard Nixon’s 
administration, from 1969 to 1974.

221
 Chapter 14: Enjoying a Professional Peak
 
Elvis agonized over his acceptance speech. His lack of formal education 
compared to most of the other honorees must have made him feel intimi-
dated. But his inspiring speech was not only eloquent; it also was one of his 
few public statements that offered a glimpse of the real Elvis Presley. He based 
part of the speech on a song by soul singer Roy Hamilton, who was one of 
Elvis’s favorites. Here’s part of his moving speech, which was printed in 
the Commercial Appeal on January 17, 1971: “When I was a child, ladies and 
gentlemen, I was a dreamer. I read comic books, and I was the hero of the 
comic book. I saw movies, and I was the hero in the movie. So every dream 
that I’ve dreamed has come true a hundred times . . . I’d like to say that I 
learned very early in life that, ‘Without a song the day would never end, 
Without a song a man ain’t got a friend, Without a song the road would never 
bend, Without a song.’ So I keep singing a song.”
 
Elvis was extremely proud of the Jaycees award, which was the only honor 
he ever accepted at a public ceremony. Today the statue, which is often on 
display at Graceland, is nicked and scratched, giving the impression that 
perhaps it was neglected or discarded. In fact, the opposite was true: Elvis was 
so touched by this accolade that he carried the award with him on every tour, 
which accounts for its worn appearance.
Went to a Garden Party: Elvis 
Performs in New York City
Perhaps it was because it was the home of Tin Pan Alley, or perhaps it 
was because of the city’s harsh critics who had always barked at his heels, 
but Elvis had never performed in concert in New York City. Finally in June 
A generous gift: Elvis shows his true colors
After being honored by the Jaycees, Elvis and 
Priscilla hosted a cocktail party for all the 
Outstanding Young Men of America honorees. 
At the party, he generously presented each 
honoree with a Mathey-Tissot watch as they 
came through the door. A tasteful-looking man’s 
watch that displayed the date, the timepiece 
featured the name “Elvis Presley” on the bev-
eled edge that encircled the face. Elvis gener-
ally gave these watches as a gesture of 
fellowship to friends and acquaintances; in this 
case, he wanted to show his respect for the 
other honorees. (For more on Elvis’s penchant 
for giving jewelry as gifts, flip to Chapter 15.)
A mix-up that revealed something of Elvis’s 
nature occurred with the giving of these gifts. 
One of the watches was accidentally handed to 
an assistant transportation chairman for the 
Jaycees, who was thrilled to be singled out by 
Elvis Presley for a gift. Elvis didn’t ask the Jaycee 
to give the watch back, because he didn’t want 
to hurt the man’s feelings. Instead Elvis ordered 
an additional watch for the ninth honoree.

222
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
1972, Colonel Tom Parker, Elvis’s manager, arranged for him to play three 
shows at the famed Madison Square Garden. On the day the tickets went on 
sale, almost 2,000 people mobbed the ticket office before dawn. The shows 
sold out so quickly that a fourth show was added, and it sold out as well. 
Elvis became the first entertainer to sell out four consecutive shows in the 
Garden.
Despite the enthusiasm of the public, Elvis and the Colonel were intimidated 
by the big-city New York critics, so they courted them in a press conference 
before the engagement. A good-natured Elvis joked with the critics and poked 
a bit of fun at himself, hoping to win them over with charm.
 
At the Madison Square Garden press conference, Elvis made one of his 
most famous and revealing statements. When a reporter asked him about 
his image, Elvis grew serious for a moment and then quietly remarked, “An 
image is one thing and a human being is another . . . It is very hard to live 
up to an image.”
Even though Elvis wore more than one jumpsuit during the engagement, the 
one most photographed was a white jumpsuit with a gold-lined cape. He 
accented the costume with the gigantic belt given to him by the International 
Hotel. The belt said “The World Champion Entertainer” — just in case the 
critics forgot who was performing. (You can read more about Elvis’s jump-
suits in Chapter 13.) Elvis appeared to be in top physical condition during the 
engagement, which was attended by 80,000 people, including the cream of 
contemporary rock artists such as John Lennon, Bob Dylan, and Elton John.
RCA recorded all four shows at the Garden for an album called Elvis as 
Recorded at Madison Square Garden. To take advantage of the good press 
and enthusiasm generated over the engagement, the record company mixed 
the songs, pressed the records, and had the albums in stores in less than 
two weeks. The hasty release even beat the bootleggers to the punch! The 
successful album reached number eight on the Top LPs, remaining on the 
charts for 34 weeks.
 
Most of the New York reviewers and critics begrudgingly offered positive 
notices, though some of them didn’t quite understand Elvis Presley and his 
music. Two separate but equally condescending reviews in the New Yorker, for 
example, seemed completely perplexed by “American Trilogy” and what it 
could possibly mean (see Chapter 13 for more information on this medley). 
However, Variety, the venerable show business trade magazine, summed 
up the experience perfectly, noting, “He stood there at the end, his arms 
stretched out, the great gold cloak giving him wings, a champion, the only 
one in his class.”

223
 Chapter 14: Enjoying a Professional Peak
Performing for the World: 
Aloha from Hawaii
About a month after the Madison Square Garden engagement, Colonel Parker 
announced that Elvis would be participating in the first worldwide live satel-
lite broadcast, because, according to the Colonel, “It is the intention of Elvis 
to please all of his fans throughout the world.”
 
Despite having a worldwide following, including the Far East, Elvis never 
played outside the United States and Canada. He had always wanted to, but 
the Colonel never arranged it. This satellite broadcast was the closest Elvis 
ever came to performing for people outside the States.
In January 1973, Elvis gave a benefit performance at the Honolulu 
International Center Arena in Hawaii for the Kuiokalani Lee Cancer Fund, 
which was the concert chosen to be broadcast to more than 40 countries 
via the Globecam Intelstat IV satellite. Titled Elvis: Aloha from Hawaii, the 
program was the first worldwide television broadcast, and more than a 
billion people eventually watched this one performance — roughly a third of 
the world’s population at the time. Satellite transmission was still relatively 
new, so only an entertainer of Elvis’s magnitude could interest the partici-
pants in pulling off this costly event. Figure 14-1 shows Elvis posing by an 
advertisement of his program.
In this section, the Aloha from Hawaii concert is reviewed in detail to capture 
this one-of-a-kind experience.

Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
 
Because of the international audience, the sheer number of people who 
watched, and the fact that no one had used satellite capabilities for an enter-
tainment program like this before, Elvis: Aloha from Hawaii is considered by 
some to be the high point of Presley’s career. In The Elvis Encyclopedia by 
Adam Victor, Memphis Mafia member Sonny West said, “It was the pinnacle of 
his career; he never looked as good again.”
Achieving a career pinnacle
Taking advantage of advances in global communications, Elvis: Aloha from 
Hawaii was beamed by the Globecam Intelsat IV satellite on January 14, 1973, 
from Honolulu International Center Arena. Producer-director Marty Pasetta 
conceived a simple but effective stage setting for the special. A backdrop 
featuring Elvis’s name in different languages reminded viewers that this spe-
cial was for an international audience, and a runway jutting into the audience 
allowed the singer to safely walk out into the crowd without actually being a 
part of it. Elvis periodically walked the runway, leaning over to receive flower 
leis from audience members. To see Elvis performing in the concert, check 
out the color photo section.
Elvis sang a variety of songs throughout the concert special, including the 
following:
 
✓ Current hits, such as “Burning Love” and “Suspicious Minds”
 
✓ Past hits “Hound Dog,” “Love Me,” and “A Big Hunk o’ Love”
 
✓ Pop and rock tunes like “My Way” and “Steamroller Blues”
 
✓ The moving Hank Williams classic “I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry”
The song selection was a fair approximation of his stage show from around 
that time.
 
After the audience left the arena, the production crew filmed Elvis singing five 
more songs, which were added to the U.S. version of the televised concert in 
order to lengthen it to a standard 90-minute television time slot.
Both this show and the dress rehearsal (which took place two days earlier) 
benefited the Kuiokalani Lee Cancer Fund. Lee was a Hawaiian composer 
who had died of cancer, and Elvis performed Lee’s song “I’ll Remember You” 
in his honor. About $75,000 was raised for the fund through ticket sales and 
additional contributions. The program cost the participating production 
companies and networks about $2.5 million, but they made their money back 
through advertising and fees.

225
 Chapter 14: Enjoying a Professional Peak
Broadcasting to the world
Broadcast at 12:30 a.m. Hawaii-Aleutian Time, Elvis: Aloha from Hawaii was 
seen in Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Thailand, South Vietnam, the 
Philippine Islands, Japan, and the Far East. Even parts of Communist China 
supposedly tuned in. The next day, the show was rebroadcast to 28 European 
countries, except for the United Kingdom. Despite Elvis’s enormous popular-
ity in England and Ireland, the BBC didn’t want to pay the asking price to par-
ticipate. These broadcasts of the special consisted of a concert performance 
by Elvis in front of a live audience. NBC broadcast the program on April 4 for 
the U.S. audience, and used four of the additional five songs Elvis recorded 
after the live show (see the preceding section for details).
 
The American broadcast of the special received a 57 share, meaning more 
than half of the people watching television tuned into Elvis: Aloha from Hawaii. 
More people watched this special than the first walk on the moon. In Japan, 
37.8 percent of people watching television were tuned into Elvis, and in the 
Philippines, an amazing 92 percent of the television viewing public watched 
the special.
Tossing the cape
Elvis performed a full dress rehearsal before an audience on January 12, 
which was recorded but not televised. Elvis wore a white jumpsuit that 
featured an American eagle on the front and back; this costume also came 
with a cape. For the finale of the rehearsal, Elvis donned the cape and 
sang his usual closing number “Can’t Help Falling in Love,” which he had 
first crooned in the 1961 film Blue Hawaii. Usually, he concluded this song 
by dropping to one knee and grabbing the ends of his cape in his hands, 
spreading the garment above him like angel wings — a grandiose gesture 
befitting the King. On this night, he added an extra touch by throwing the 
cape into the crowd. Earlier in the performance he had thrown his belt, 
so it was only fitting to toss his cape as well. (You can read more on this 
jumpsuit, cape, and belt in Chapter 13.)
After the rehearsal, Elvis’s foreman, Joe Esposito, called costume designer 
Bill Belew in a panic to tell him that the singer had just thrown his cape and 
belt into the crowd. Belew and his crew worked overtime to make another 
cape, complete with jewels and hand embroidery. Belew’s assistant flew with 
the new cape and belt to ensure that the accessories arrived on time and in 
top condition. After he delivered them, he stayed for the concert. When it 
was over, the assistant reluctantly called Belew to tell him that Elvis had 
thrown the second cape into the audience. Now a part of Elvis lore, the cape 
story has been told and retold in countless books and memoirs, with the 
details often confused. The episode deserves its legendary status because it 
offers a larger-than-life ending to a once-in-a-lifetime event.

226
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
Reliving the concert over and 
over with the Aloha albums
Those fans who missed the concert didn’t have long to wait for the album. 
RCA employed two record-pressing plants and worked them overtime to 
quickly get out an album. One month later, a double-LP titled Aloha from 
Hawaii via Satellite was released simultaneously around the world. The 
album became Elvis’s first number one LP in eight years, and as it turned out, 
it was the last chart-topping album of his career, at least on the pop charts. 
Within two weeks, the album sold half a million copies before eventually 
reaching multi-platinum status.
 
Since then, RCA and the Elvis Presley Estate have issued many versions of this 
historic special and album, making it difficult to separate the original from the 
additional footage. Here are some of the many versions:
 
✓ In 1988, the music from the dress rehearsal was released as The 
Alternate Aloha.
 
✓ In 1992 and 1998, the album Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite was rere-
leased with the additional tracks recorded after the show.
 
✓ In 2000, a DVD of Aloha from Hawaii with both the special and the dress 
rehearsal was released.
 
✓ In 2004, another edition, also called Aloha From Hawaii, was issued that 
included the special, the dress rehearsal, the extra songs recorded for 
the American broadcast, and footage of Elvis interacting with fans at the 
Honolulu airport.
Capturing the Concert Years on Film
Some claim that the best movies starring Elvis Presley are two documenta-
ries that he made during the concert years — Elvis: That’s the Way It Is and 
Elvis on Tour. Well crafted by prominent filmmakers, both documentaries 
received critical acclaim. As decades pass and memories fade, these 
documentaries not only chronicle his music and performing style but remind 
younger generations of his impact on audiences. This section offers the 
highlights of these two well-crafted documentaries.
Elvis: That’s the Way It Is
Elvis: That’s the Way It Is focuses on Presley’s 1970 summer appearance at the 
International Hotel, beginning with rehearsals in Hollywood, though addi-

227
 Chapter 14: Enjoying a Professional Peak
tional material is also included. Elvis began rehearsals July 5 at the MGM 
studios, where he’s shown whipping his band into shape and mastering new 
material for the act. Elvis and the band rehearsed 60 songs altogether, but 
most of them didn’t make it into the show. (Chapter 13 introduces the band 
he performed with at the International.)
Shots of the massive promotional buildup in Las Vegas are intercut with the 
rehearsal footage. A film crew was even sent to Luxembourg to record an 
Elvis Presley convention to illustrate the excitement of fans over Elvis’s 
return to public performances. The film is structured so that the rehearsals, 
the scenes of preparation, and the shots of enthusiastic fans build anticipa-
tion and excitement for the main event.
The International show opened August 10, and the cameras recorded not 
only opening night but also several performances throughout the engage-
ment. Plus, one segment in which Elvis sings “Mystery Train” and “Tiger 
Man” was filmed at a concert at Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix, 
Arizona. When edited together, the concert footage builds to an exciting, 
fast-paced climax of Elvis performing his best material. Dressed in a simple, 
white jumpsuit, accented with fringe instead of rhinestones and gems, Elvis 
is clearly at the top of his game.
Elvis: That’s the Way It Is was directed by Denis Sanders, who won an 
Academy Award for Best Documentary for his film Czechoslovakia 1968. 
Award-winning cinematographer Lucien Ballard, one of the most respected 
in Hollywood, caught the excitement of Elvis’s performance on stage with 
eight Panavision cameras.
 
One of Ballard’s most acclaimed films is The Wild Bunch (1969), directed by 
Sam Peckinpah. This groundbreaking violent western is justifiably famous 
for its fast-paced editing in a montage style. This style of editing consists of a 
barrage of brief shots to depict an action, making the editing more obvious 
and the action more stimulating. Ballard and director Sanders employed a 
similar technique in Elvis: That’s the Way It Is to capture the excitement of 
Elvis and his dramatic music. When Colonel Parker saw the film during a 
rough cut, he didn’t care for the editing style, but when Elvis saw the final 
version of the film, he was pleased.
 
Elvis: That’s the Way It Is was released on November 11, 1970, to good reviews. 
It reached number 22 on the Variety weekly box office report, which is a fair 
showing for a documentary. The Hollywood Reporter remarked that Elvis 
probably was the only entertainer alive who could draw enough people into 
a theater to make a documentary profitable at the box office. The film also 
introduced Elvis as a live performer to an audience who was too young to 
remember him from the 1950s and knew Elvis only from his movies.

228
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
Elvis on Tour
The second documentary to capture Elvis in performance focused on his 
road show. Elvis on Tour chronicled the singer’s short but grueling 15-city 
tour in the spring of 1972. The tour started in Buffalo, New York, and came 
to a rousing conclusion in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Filmmakers Pierre 
Adidge and Robert Abel succeeded in capturing the hectic pace of Elvis’s 
touring schedule through a montage sequence of cities the singer visited 
during the tour.
One of the most telling scenes is not one in which Elvis sings onstage. Just 
before the show is about to start, Elvis, members of the TCB Band, the Sweet 
Inspirations, and the Stamps are shown waiting to go on. (Check out Chapter 
13 for more on these groups that Elvis performed with.) A bit nervous, Elvis 
begins to sing the gospel song “Bosom of Abraham” to break the tension, and 
the others quickly join in. Obviously, everyone knows the song as they break 
into it spontaneously. Not only is gospel music key to Elvis’s sound, but it’s 
also the thread that binds together the seemingly diverse musical elements 
of his act — the rock band, the African American backup singers, and the 
country gospel quartet.
 
Costing $600,000 to produce (not counting Elvis’s fee of $1 million), Elvis 
on Tour recouped its production costs after just three days in theaters. 
Documentaries are rarely major box-office draws, but this film was a financial 
success. Critically acclaimed as well, Elvis on Tour won a Golden Globe as the 
Best Documentary of 1972.
Again, the creative success of the film was due to its effective editing style, 
which relied on a split-screen technique to capture the excitement of Elvis 
in concert. Multiple images of Elvis performing were shown on the screen 
simultaneously, a technique that had been used in the 1970 documentary 
Woodstock.
 
The series of scenes from Elvis’s movies plus the succession of clips of the 
different cities visited on the tour also depended on precise editing for its 
visual impact. In charge of these montage sequences was a young filmmaker 
named Martin Scorsese.
Influencing Las Vegas Entertainment
One of the remarkable characteristics of Elvis’s music, performing style, and 
career is that those three elements worked together to make Presley a wholly 
unique entertainer. And yet he also inspired others to follow his musical 
choices, his flair, and his performing style. During his concert years, Elvis 

229
 Chapter 14: Enjoying a Professional Peak
seemed to be a show business genre unto himself, but other entertainers 
were clearly influenced by him, especially in Las Vegas. Elvis had a profound 
impact on Las Vegas entertainment, and only recently have his concert years 
been considered in that regard. This section offers some observations and 
comments on Elvis’s impact on the city that sparked his comeback.
A therapeutic shot in the 
arm for Las Vegas
The generation of pop singers that dominated the Vegas Strip prior to Elvis 
sang or crooned with conviction and personal style, but that style — 
epitomized by the members of the Rat Pack — was low key, relaxed, and 
simple. Standing in front of the audience in their suits, they sang the way pop 
singers had sung for decades. Even though they spoke to the audience, intro-
duced songs, and joked onstage, a distance stood between the performer on 
the stage and the people in the audience. Audiences who grew up with rock 
’n’ roll couldn’t relate to the conventions and music of previous generations, 
and they looked upon Vegas as a destination for members of their parents’ 
crowd. So Las Vegas began to lose tourists, and the hotels often lost money 
on their entertainment.
Elvis’s high-energy, large-scale, interactive show added excitement and sex 
appeal to Vegas entertainment, which attracted young adult audiences to the 
city. The jumpsuits and theatrics may have seemed like good old-fashioned 
show business, but Elvis combined them with a soulful, expressive singing 
style and a rock ’n’ roll sensibility. His show became a template for future 
Vegas acts. (See the following section for details on acts that followed in 
Elvis’s footsteps.)
 
Nancy Sinatra, who not only knew Elvis but also knew something of Las Vegas 
through her famous father, reflected in the ABC television special Elvis: Viva 
Las Vegas, “Las Vegas needed a shot in the arm, and Elvis was the potion. He 
got the young people in. And the young people helped to build a new Vegas.”
Establishing the Vegas-style 
performance template
Singers Tom Jones and Engelbert Humperdinck were among the first to 
follow in Elvis’s footsteps in Vegas. Though Tom Jones played Las Vegas 
before Elvis, he ramped up the energy and sex appeal of his act after seeing 
Presley perform at the International in August 1969. Engelbert Humperdinck 
also frequented Elvis’s shows during the 1970s.

230
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
 
Decades later, Elvis’s combination of sex appeal and showbiz glitz with a rock 
’n’ roll beat can still be found in the acts of Vegas stalwarts Celine Dion, Cher, 
Prince, and Elton John. In addition, Elvis’s long-term contract with the 
International and his month-long engagements prefigured the current Vegas 
residency contracts in which entertainers perform at the same hotel for several 
months. Even Elvis’s entourage, consisting of the Memphis Mafia, and his 
penchant for gaudy jewelry — rings on every finger, long pendants, huge 
sunglasses — seem oddly contemporary.
 
In The Elvis Encyclopedia by Adam Victor, Engelbert Humperdinck said this of 
Elvis: “I learned about humility, charm, and how to work an audience from 
watching Elvis in concert. If you’re going to steal — and every performer does 
it from someone at some time — then steal from the best, which was Elvis.”

T
he timing of Elvis’s separation and divorce from Priscilla makes it 
virtually impossible not to find connections between his professional 
life and his personal life. The couple was separated in July 1972, a month 
after the Madison Square Garden engagement, and the divorce was final in 
October 1973. The Elvis: Aloha from Hawaii special, which was broadcast in 
January 1973, capped his succession of career high points. Those who were 
closest to Elvis, including friends and family members, noted that he and his 
career were never the same after the disintegration of his marriage.
 
Elvis’s cousin Billy Smith noticed a change in Presley’s behavior after Priscilla 
left for good, remarking in The Elvis Encyclopedia by Adam Victor, “Elvis changed 
a lot after he was married and after Lisa was born. But I think he changed the 
most after the divorce.”
However, other factors contributed to Elvis’s personal and professional 
decline, including his secluded existence and a number of self-destructive 
habits. Elvis also indulged in unhealthy eating habits and drugs over the 
years, which caused or aggravated health problems. Around 1973, the 
self-destructive habits accelerated, and by 1974, the effects had become 
noticeable in public. Ironically, the nonstop touring and month-long Vegas 
engagements that invigorated Elvis in 1970 had become a trap of repetition 
and routine by 1973. Caught in a cycle of disappointment, self-indulgence, 
and monotony, Elvis was no longer challenged by his career, and his drug use 
increased. Eventually, his excessive lifestyle led to the inevitable: Elvis Aron 
Presley died on August 16, 1977.
This chapter chronicles the singer’s sad decline, going inside the gates of 
Graceland for a glimpse at the dark side of celebrity. It also offers a look at 
the final studio albums that Elvis recorded, suggesting that the songs he 
selected to record reflected his sadness and despair. The chapter concludes 
with a description of his funeral.

Caught in a Trap: Discovering 
the Downside of Fame
When Elvis first became a national singing sensation in 1956, he enjoyed the 
adoring fans who followed him around or waited for him in front of his house. 
He flirted with them, joked around, and freely gave autographs. (See Chapters 
3 and 4 for more on fan behavior during his early career.)
It wasn’t long before Elvis’s fans became too much for him to manage. If 
adoring fans caught up with him after a concert, they mobbed him, pushed 
him down, and sometimes stripped him bare. Elvis began to ponder the price 
of fame when he was shooting King Creole on location in New Orleans in 
1958. The singer discovered he couldn’t sightsee, eat in the city’s magnificent 
restaurants, or enjoy the night life without his fans besieging him. So after 
his stint in the army, Elvis and his entourage grew accustomed to secluding 
themselves behind the gates of Graceland or behind the iron fence of his 
Hollywood home to protect the singer’s privacy.
While relaxing at home in Memphis, Elvis and his entourage, who were called 
the Memphis Mafia, occasionally ventured into town to seek entertainment. 
Sometimes they rode their motorcycles late at night when they were sure 
that most people were asleep. Because Elvis’s persistent fans prevented him 
from going out during normal hours, he often rented movie theaters (either 
the Malco or the Memphian) from midnight to dawn. Elvis also rented amuse-
ment parks or roller skating rinks after hours for himself and his friends. 
Buying sprees of furniture or jewelry, dental appointments, and other busi-
ness transactions generally occurred after business hours as well. The after-
hours lifestyle made it easier to avoid mobs of fans, but it also led to a 
Neverland-type of existence in which normal social conventions didn’t apply.
 
This isolation from the norms of real life, coupled with his boredom when he 
was between projects and the privileges that came with stardom, eventually 
led Elvis to indulge in several destructive habits, including overeating, drugs, 
and expensive shopping sprees.
Traveling the Road of Excess
Elvis’s profession as an entertainer meant he lived without the constraints of 
the normal, nine-to-five world. And, because of his celebrity, he could get what 
he wanted when he wanted it. Elvis’s talents paid the bills, so few members of 
his family or entourage dared to tell him “no.” Most of his entourage indulged 
in everything he did, whether it be taking drugs, chasing women, or eating 
food at any hour. If Elvis found a new hobby, vehicle, or pastime that provided 
fun and entertainment, he purchased what he needed for himself and for the 

233
 Chapter 15: Fading Away
closest members of his entourage no matter the cost. This section details some 
of the behaviors of Elvis and the Memphis Mafia that provide context for 
understanding the dark side of too much privilege and enormous celebrity.
Living in a state of arrested development
Elvis’s daily life, even while resting at Graceland, was so far removed from a 
conventional lifestyle that he had lost touch with the norms of the everyday 
world. He slept all day and stayed up all night and surrounded himself with 
an entourage of buddies even while he was married. The fraternity-house 
atmosphere interfered with his emotional maturity and his marriage. When 
together, he and the Memphis Mafia could raise the roof with their antics, 
even causing trouble on the sets of his movies on occasion.
Surrounding himself with an entourage: The Memphis Mafia
From the beginning of his success, Elvis liked to surround himself with 
friends and family members who served as bodyguards or who helped him 
with the details of travel. The entertainment press called this group of close 
friends, business associates, and employees “the Memphis Mafia.” They 
not only worked for Elvis, but they also kept him entertained and indulged in 
the same habits and pastimes that he did. (Check out Chapter 7 and the 
appendix for more information on the members of Elvis’s clan.)
 
No one will ever know for certain why Elvis surrounded himself with so many 
buddy-bodyguards for so long, but a hint can be found in a comment he made 
to Tropic magazine on April 28, 1968. Elvis revealed, “The trouble is, when a 
fellow is by himself and starts thinking, the bad things are always stronger in 
his memory than the happy things.”
Elvis, Colonel Tom Parker (his long-time manager), and Vernon Presley (his 
father) never paid the members of the Mafia high wages, but Elvis loaned the 
men money for down payments on houses and gave them automobiles, 
motorcycles, trucks, jewelry, guns, and other expensive gifts. Most of the 
Memphis Mafia worked for Elvis out of friendship and not for the money. In 
fact, many of the men were so close to him that they lived at Graceland from 
time to time. But, living in a fraternity-like environment during adulthood 
isn’t conducive to emotional maturity, and it didn’t encourage Elvis to assess 
his bizarre lifestyle or give up his self-destructive habits.
 
Over the years, the faces in the Memphis Mafia changed, but a few men 
remained with Elvis for much of his career. The most prominent members of 
the group include Red and Sonny West (who were cousins), Marty Lacker, Joe 
Esposito, George Klein, Jerry Schilling, Charlie Hodge, Gene Smith (Elvis’s 
cousin), Lamar Fike, and Alan Fortas. Some members of the Memphis Mafia 
had careers of their own and therefore didn’t work for Elvis exclusively. 
George Klein, for example, was a disc jockey in and around Memphis for most 
of his life, and Red West, who started hanging out with Elvis around 1955, 
worked as a stuntman in Hollywood.

234
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
Engaging in antics: Boys will be boys
During the 1960s, when Elvis devoted his career to making movies, members 
of the Memphis Mafia joined Elvis on location or on set at the studio. Some of 
the men had bit parts and some had jobs assisting Elvis, but their main func-
tion was to keep their boss company.
On a movie set, Elvis and his friends liked to pull practical jokes. After Elvis 
lost respect for the movies he was making, his kidding around seemed to take 
precedence over his acting. Pie fights were common, and on the set of Easy 
Come, Easy Go (1967), director John Rich often argued with Elvis about his 
constant practical jokes. During one scene, Elvis kept bursting into laughter 
every time he looked at Red or Sonny West. He blew his lines take after take. 
Rich lost his temper and ordered everyone off the set, but Elvis stepped in 
and set Rich straight. “We’re doing these movies because it’s supposed to be 
fun, nothing more,” he told his director. “When they cease to be fun, then 
we’ll cease to do them.” But during the filming of Clambake (1967), Elvis’s 
gang caused so much confusion on the set that when production on his next 
movie Stay Away, Joe (1968) began, a memo came down from the MGM execu-
tive offices warning Elvis and the Memphis Mafia that their usual behavior 
wouldn’t be tolerated.
Other stories reinforce the idea that when together, Elvis and the Memphis 
Mafia could act like adolescents. Whenever Elvis was working in Hollywood, 
he and his entourage lived together in a Bel Air mansion that had once belonged 
to the Shah of Iran. (You can read more about this mansion in Chapter 19.) The 
house was the scene of many late-night parties, which often were attended by a 
host of Hollywood party girls, extras, and starlets. The constant parade of 
girls over the years made focusing on relationships impossible for all the 
Memphis Mafia members. The whole group remained in a state of arrested 
emotional development.
Takin’ care of business
Elvis and the Memphis Mafia had their own 
symbol — a lightning bolt combined with the 
initials TCB. Elvis designed the insignia to sym-
bolize the code of honor he wanted his entou-
rage to live by; it signified a take-charge attitude 
toward life. TCB stands for “Taking Care of 
Business,” and the lightning bolt represents 
speed, so Elvis’s coat of arms means “taking 
care of business in a flash.” He had charms pro-
duced with this insignia for each member of the 
Memphis Mafia, and many of the men wore 
them on chains around their necks. Elvis also 
had TLC, or “tender, loving care” charms 
designed for the wives and girlfriends of his 
favorite companions.

235
 Chapter 15: Fading Away
When Elvis first came to Hollywood, the high jinks weren’t as sordid or ado-
lescent as they would later become. In the early days, he organized a football 
team to relieve the tedium of movie production. Elvis and his buddies were 
joined on the football field by young actors such as Kent McCord, Ty Hardin, 
Pat Boone, Robert Conrad, Gary Lockwood, and Ricky Nelson.
Toward the end of his Hollywood career, after Elvis had become bored with 
making movies, his behavior and antics became wilder and more erratic. He 
took up more-expensive hobbies and less-constructive pastimes to fill his 
time in Hollywood. On one shopping spree while he was making Tickle Me in 
1965, Elvis bought all of his friends motorcycles so they could go riding 
together. Another time, Elvis had his buddies go to several photography 
shops and buy all their flashbulbs. They dumped the flashbulbs into the 
swimming pool and shot them with BB guns. When a bulb was hit, it exploded 
and sunk. After three nights of shooting, it took a man two days to clean the 
pool.
Struggling with a drug problem
Elvis’s most destructive behavior was probably his use and abuse of pre-
scription drugs, which eventually altered his behavior and personality. 
According to members of the Memphis Mafia, Elvis began to regularly use 
amphetamines and diet pills in the 1960s; the drugs were intended to help 
Elvis keep his weight down and stay awake for long hours. Some accounts 
claim that Elvis was introduced to amphetamines while in the army as a 
means to stay awake and alert during long hours on duty. To counteract the 
amphetamines, Elvis and his buddy-bodyguards, who indulged in whatever 
Elvis did, began taking sedatives and tranquilizers.
By the early 1970s, when he was touring on a debilitating schedule of one-
nighters, Elvis was taking more medication than ever. The year 1973 seemed 
a watershed for increased drug use, and he began regularly taking such 
extreme narcotics as Dilaudid and Demerol. These drugs eventually left him 
in a state of mental limbo, and the affects of their use were apparent when he 
was performing — something that hadn’t happened before.
At times, Elvis cut back on the drugs and attempted to detox during hospital 
stays, but the efforts didn’t last. Given the nature of these heavy-duty narcot-
ics, it seems clear that Elvis was looking to escape something. Whether it was 
career disappointment, boredom, spiritual loss, failed relationships, or a 
combination of factors is unknown and clouded by the highly subjective 
memoirs and personal accounts of friends and family members.

236
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
 
Even though Elvis clearly used his celebrity to obtain massive amounts of 
drugs, the context of the times needs to be taken into account in order to get 
the full picture. Elvis’s substance abuse problem began as a result of prescrip-
tion drug use. Some of these drugs were in fact administered for actual health 
problems; he had back pain, digestive troubles, and many eye afflictions, 
including glaucoma. Treatments for these conditions put Elvis in the hospital 
several times between 1973 and his death four years later. He also was hospi-
talized for throat ailments, pleurisy, and hypertension. Remember that during 
the 1960s and 1970s, a different attitude toward prescription drugs existed; 
drugs were prescribed much more freely. When Elvis went into the army, the 
stimulant Benedrine was actually a legal over-the-counter drug; during the 
1970s, Valium was frequently prescribed for anxiety — before its addictive 
properties were discovered. So part of Elvis’s rationalization for taking pills to 
relieve either physical or psychic pain was indicative of the times. Ironically, 
Elvis rarely indulged in alcohol and often spoke out against taking illegal drugs.
Some members of his entourage, including Red West, attempted to talk Elvis 
out of using so many drugs and even to prevent the drugs from getting to 
him, but their efforts were in vain. Elvis’s primary physician, Dr. George 
Nichopoulos, sometimes gave his patient placebos, but if Elvis caught on, he 
went elsewhere for the drugs. Elvis’s last long-term girlfriend, Linda 
Thompson, left him in 1976 after she tired of nursing him through dangerous 
drug episodes and of being fearful of the inevitable. Members of the Memphis 
Mafia disagree about the amount of drugs Elvis took, but the fact remains 
that he took more than his body could withstand. His drug abuse not only 
brought on a decline in his career, but it also led to his death.
In May 1973, Elvis’s father, Vernon, and the Colonel hired a private investiga-
tor to discover the drug suppliers who were freely giving him prescriptions. 
When the suppliers (who turned out to be doctors) were uncovered, Elvis 
found other doctors to give him the drugs.
No one could help
In many of the memoirs by members of the 
Memphis Mafia, several claimed they wanted 
to get Elvis to realize his drug use was out of 
control. But, Elvis was a superstar who dictated 
what the group did not only because they 
worked for him but also because they spent 
their leisure time together. He signed their 
paychecks, bought cars and houses for them, 
and took them on vacation. The nature of the 
relationship between Elvis and his buddy-
bodyguards made it unlikely that he would listen 
to them. As many of them have said, no one 
could tell Elvis what to do. Plus, some of the 
group did drugs with him, so they were in no 
shape to help him.
According to the “bodyguard book,” Elvis: What 
Happened?, Red West did have a heart-to-heart 
conversation with his long-time friend and 
employer when Elvis called to attempt to stop 
the publication of the book. Not surprisingly, 
he was unsuccessful in getting Elvis to listen. 
(See Chapter 17 for more about the bodyguard 
book.)

237
 Chapter 15: Fading Away
 
Beauty queen Linda Thompson was Elvis’s girlfriend from 1972 to 1976, stay-
ing with him during several difficult times in his life. Long after leaving Elvis, 
Thompson married gold medal champion Bruce Jenner and then record pro-
ducer David Foster. An amateur poet, Thompson had impressed Elvis with her 
way with words. While married to Foster, she penned the words to several 
songs and received an Academy Award nomination in 1992 for her lyrics for “I 
Have Nothing” from The Bodyguard.
Wrestling with a weight problem
Elvis’s eating habits have been exaggerated over the years, because stories of 
his kingly excesses have become part of his myth. As early as 1955, when he 
was still considered an up-and-coming country-western singer, articles about 
the hot, young singer often mentioned that he liked to down several cheese-
burgers at one sitting. An article in Esquire magazine in the late 1960s took a 
sarcastic but lighthearted tone when describing Elvis’s favorite snack of 
peanut butter and mashed banana sandwiches washed down with several 
Pepsis. Prior to his death, stories about his food habits tended to be light-
hearted or matter of fact.
Exaggeration aside, Elvis didn’t eat a healthy diet by today’s standards. Most 
of Elvis’s favorite foods were traditional working-class Southern dishes, 
which lean heavily toward fried meats. Reporters and magazine writers who 
weren’t familiar with Southern cooking felt that Elvis’s eating habits were 
peculiar, but in reality many people in the South enjoyed the same foods. 
Other writers reported that the amount of food Elvis consumed was exces-
sive. They told tall tales about Elvis eating so many Spanish omelets that he 
created an egg shortage in Tennessee. Rumors also have claimed that he 
once ate 30 cups of yogurt, 8 honeydew melons, and a hundred dollars worth 
of ice cream bars in one night. Elvis sometimes went on eating binges, partic-
ularly during his time off between projects, but stories about binges on such 
foods as bacon, ice cream, cheeseburgers, and pizza have been repeated so 
often that it seems as though Elvis ate that much every day. Elvis had many 
unhealthy eating habits and gained weight, but the stories about how much 
he consumed have been widely exaggerated.
 
After Elvis’s death, this kind of report on his eating habits took on a dark con-
notation. Stories of food consumption became sensationalized attempts to 
“prove” that Elvis was out of control, equating his appetite for food with his 
appetite for drugs. These attempts at armchair psychology didn’t take into 
account that Elvis ate this way all of his life. His eating habits led to a weight 
problem in adulthood when he wasn’t working and exercising, but his puffy, 
bloated look of the mid- to late 1970s wasn’t due to overeating; it was due in 
part to the drugs he was consuming. (See Chapter 17 for more information on 
how the press covered Elvis’s drug problems after he died.)

238
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
Collecting extravagances
Not all of Elvis’s extravagances were bad for his health, but they all suggested 
an inclination toward excess. He liked to collect ostentatious jewelry, fancy 
cars, and all kinds of guns. He also was fascinated by law enforcement and 
loved to collect authentic police badges. I describe his collections in the fol-
lowing sections.
Accessorizing with rings and other flashy jewelry
At the start of his career, Elvis developed an image as an average, red-
blooded, all-American male who would never wear any jewelry except a 
watch. Photographs of Elvis in the early days rarely show him wearing gaudy 
jewelry, but during the 1970s, Elvis began to wear rings on all his fingers 
while he was onstage and off. He also wore heavy medallions, gold-plated 
belts, and chain-link bracelets. On a gold chain around his neck, Elvis wore a 
gold Star of David and a crucifix. He also liked to carry walking sticks adorned 
with tops made of silver or gold. Elvis routinely bought expensive jewelry not 
only for himself but also for the Memphis Mafia, their wives, and his show 
business friends.
Purchasing cars for himself and others
Elvis had a lifelong love affair with Cadillacs. During his career, he bought 
more than 100 Caddys for himself and the members of his entourage. One of 
the first cars Elvis purchased was a 1956 pink Cadillac sedan. He promptly 
gave the car to his mother, Gladys, despite the fact that she couldn’t drive. 
This was the only Cadillac that Elvis kept throughout his life, and it’s still 
parked at Graceland.
In addition to Cadillacs, Elvis bought unique foreign cars, such as a three-
door Messerschmitt, as well as prestigious automobiles, including any 
number of Lincolns, a Mercedes limousine, a couple of Stutz Bearcats, and a 
Rolls Royce. Elvis’s most outrageous vehicle was his 1960 Cadillac limousine 
that had been customized by George Barris, a well-known auto customizer. 
More of a promotional gimmick than a personal vehicle, the car was painted 
with diamond-dust gold paint and featured a motorized shoeshine kit, a wet 
bar, a television, and a record player. The car was too cumbersome and 
impractical to use every day, so Elvis eventually loaned the gold Cadillac to 
MGM to promote one of his movies. The car, which is worth more than 
$100,000, is now on display in the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville.
Collecting and buying cars in and of itself isn’t particularly unusual, but 
buying them for complete strangers does suggest that there was more 
to these spontaneous gestures than meets the eye. Elvis was naturally 
generous. He gave freely to his friends and their families, and he also donated 
large amounts of money to charity. Once, while he was buying a couple 
of El Dorados for members of his entourage, Elvis noticed a young couple 

239
 Chapter 15: Fading Away
wandering around the dealer’s lot trying to find a car that they could afford. 
Elvis told them to pick any car they wanted. Then he wrote out a check and 
left the salesman to do the paperwork.
 
Part of Elvis’s penchant for giving away cars was his generous nature, but it 
also suggests an attempt to fill a void or to forge meaningful connections with 
people. These stories of his buying sprees and giveaways, which have become 
a part of his legend, also clearly suggest a life of excess and privilege.
Packing a pistol
Elvis also collected guns and many other kinds of weapons. He owned thou-
sands of dollars worth of guns. Elvis also lavished expensive guns on the 
members of the Memphis Mafia and on Priscilla. His bodyguards, particularly 
Red and Sonny West, often carried their weapons on them, which might be 
expected, but then so did Elvis and Priscilla. Priscilla frequently carried a 
dainty Derringer in her purse as a matter of course. And Elvis once boarded a 
commercial flight while packing a pistol. When the ticket agent followed him 
onto the plane to tell him he couldn’t take a gun on board, Elvis left the plane 
in a huff. But the pilot came scurrying after him and apologized for the ticket 
agent, allowing Elvis to get back on the airplane.
During the 1970s, Elvis carried a gun with him at all times because he was 
concerned for his safety. After he returned to live performances in Las Vegas, 
Elvis received many death and kidnapping threats. He believed that assassins 
wanted glory through media attention. According to Elvis, they were so eager 
for the fame that would come from killing someone of his stature that they 
were willing to chance death or to live out their lives in prison.
In 1971, while Elvis was performing in Las Vegas, an anonymous caller got 
through to his hotel room and warned him that he faced an assassination 
attempt during that evening’s performance. Later that day, Elvis received a 
hotel menu with his picture on the front. The picture had been defaced, and a 
handgun had been drawn near Elvis’s heart. A message included with the 
menu read, “Guess who, and where?” The FBI was called in, which must have 
both thrilled and frightened Elvis, and the hotel management told him he 
didn’t have to go on with the performance. But Elvis stuck a Derringer into 
his boot and a .45 into his belt and did the show anyway.
Over the next few years, Elvis received so many death threats that body-
guards Red and Sonny West became cautious about allowing strangers to get 
near Elvis. Their tactics were often rough, and they were frequently criticized 
by other entertainers and officials in the industry. At least three lawsuits 
were filed against Elvis in conjunction with the strong-arm tactics of his 
guards. Considering the fact that Elvis felt it was perfectly okay to carry a 
loaded pistol in his boot or belt, he was lucky he didn’t shoot anyone himself.

240
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
 
According to legend, Elvis expressed his anger toward television sets. He 
supposedly shot out the TV screen when something came on that he didn’t 
want to see. The number of times he actually shot out televisions has 
probably been exaggerated much like the stories about Elvis’s eating binges, 
but he supposedly blasted at least one television set with the Derringer he 
kept in his boot because singer Robert Goulet appeared on the screen.
Collecting badges of honor
Elvis was infatuated with law enforcement and collected police badges 
from whomever he could persuade to give him one. And, he didn’t want an 
honorary badge or a replica; he always wanted the real thing. Elvis asked the 
sheriff of Shelby County, Tennessee, to get not just him, but also his father, 
his doctor, and most members of the Memphis Mafia, official deputy’s 
badges. Elvis also had badges from the Palm Springs Police Department and 
police departments in other cities. Considering that Elvis once had an image 
as a rebel who opposed authority, it’s ironic that he became so fascinated 
with law enforcement.
Lost and Weary: Watching 
the King’s Career Decline
Elvis’s personal and professional decline became noticeable to the press and 
public around early 1974. He was unable to take off weight before his tours or 
Las Vegas engagements, and his behavior seemed increasingly erratic. By this 
time, Elvis was tired of the grind of performing live, and he grew increasingly 
disinterested in recording in a studio. Desperate to coerce Elvis into cutting 
new material, RCA helped their number-one singer turn part of his home into a 
makeshift recording studio. The material for Elvis’s last album before he died, 
appropriately named Moody Blue, was recorded at Graceland.
The end draws near: Elvis’s final concert
Despite months of suffering digestive problems, 
bouts of vomiting, and head, stomach, and 
muscle pain, on June 26, 1977, Elvis and his 
entourage flew into Indianapolis, Indiana, for 
his 56th concert that year. When the plane 
landed, Elvis was so fatigued that members of 
the Memphis Mafia were concerned about his 
welfare. He rested at a local hotel before pro-
ceeding to Market Square Arena.
Backstage before the show, RCA presented 
Elvis with a special plaque commemorating the 
two billionth Presley record pressed by the 
company. The plaque featured a reproduction 
of his last album cover. That evening the show 
went on at 8:30 before a packed house of 18,000. 
Elvis gave one of his best performances in 
recent months. Unfortunately, no one knew it 
would be his last.

241
 Chapter 15: Fading Away
This section takes a look at Elvis’s career during his last few years; it 
examines how his physical and spiritual decline affected his professional 
activities and vice versa.
Paying the piper: The high 
price of the road
The grueling touring schedule and the month-long Las Vegas engagements 
took their toll on Elvis by 1973. What had once been a lifeline to a drowning 
singing career was now an exhausting chore; what had once been a challenge 
for Elvis was now routine. Elvis changed out the songs in the show so he 
didn’t have to perform the exact same songs each night over the years. But, 
the format of the show didn’t alter from about 1970, when he played Vegas 
for the second time, to the last performance he gave on June 26, 1977, at 
Market Square Arena in Indianapolis, Indiana.
Fans expected and still enjoyed the rituals that were part of the concert 
experience, and his shows continued to be popular. However, Elvis’s 
increasing penchant for joking during the songs revealed his boredom with 
the show and the routine it had become. He seemed particularly unhappy 
with his long Vegas engagements. After his last show in the summer of 
1973, he supposedly wanted to quit, but he continued to play Vegas until 
December 1976, which was his last engagement there.
 
Elvis bluntly revealed his feelings on stage in Sin City in late 1976, just about 
eight months before he died. He said to the crowd, “I hate Las Vegas.”
Many have speculated as to why Elvis continued to tour and play such long 
engagements in Vegas after he was no longer challenged by them. Some 
blame the Colonel and his love of gambling. Parker loved Vegas, gambled 
frequently, and enjoyed the privileges of being the manager of the city’s 
favorite son. According to some, he signed Elvis into long-term deals with the 
International Hotel because he enjoyed the Vegas lifestyle too much.
 
However, Elvis’s situation was too complicated to blame his decline on busi-
ness obligations. Increased drug use and personal disappointment led to a 
spiritual and personal malaise that made changing the act or accepting new 
challenges difficult for Elvis.
Singing them moody and blue: 
Elvis records his last albums
Elvis’s record output during the 1970s was extensive, making his recording 
schedule as grueling as his concert tours. Each year RCA typically released 

242
Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
three to four studio albums, one or two live albums, and various singles. 
Because Elvis lost his enthusiasm for recording (just as he had for touring 
and performing in Vegas), this output diminished as the 1970s wore on. By 
1976 and despite his contractual obligations, no one could get Elvis into the 
recording studio. And producer Felton Jarvis had the unenviable task of 
trying to release material on schedule for RCA.
To pacify Elvis by making the recording process as easy as possible, RCA 
sent their recording truck to Graceland in February 1976 so the reluctant 
singer could work in the convenience of his own home. Technicians set up a 
makeshift studio in the downstairs backroom known as the Jungle Room. 
(Flip to Chapter 19 for more on this and other Graceland rooms.) They made 
some technical compromises but, from this session and a later session in 
October, RCA got enough material to produce two albums: From Elvis Presley 
Boulevard, Memphis, Tennessee and Moody Blue. The October session, 
which resulted in only four completed tracks, was Elvis’s last effort at studio 
recording before he died.
 
Critics and biographers often overlook these final LPs because they’re hodge-
podges of tracks. While neither album is a musical milestone, both tell us 
something about Elvis Presley at the very end of his life and career, and for 
that reason they deserve consideration and evaluation.

Released in April 1976, From Elvis Presley Boulevard, Memphis, Tennessee 
offers ten songs whose titles seem eerily reflective of Elvis’s emotional 
state, albeit in hindsight. The song selection leans heavily to ballads of heart-
break and despair, and as such, they tell his story. Here’s the list of songs on 
the album:
 
✓ “Hurt”
 
✓ “Never Again”
 
✓ “Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain”
 
✓ “Danny Boy”
 
✓ “The Last Farewell”
 
✓ “For the Heart”
 
✓ “Bitter They Are, Harder They Fall”
 
✓ “Solitaire”
 
✓ “Love Coming Down”
 
✓ “I’ll Never Fall in Love Again”
The album reached number 1 on the Billboard country charts, but it reached 
only number 41 on the list of Top LPs. The ballad material was well suited to 
a country audience, who prefers songs of sentiment and raw emotion. The 
album remained on the charts for 17 weeks, eventually earning gold status.

 Chapter 15: Fading Away
Moody Blue
Even though Elvis never wrote a song, one of his main talents was his ability 
to select material that spoke to him and personalize it through his interpreta-
tion. He had a talent for selecting material that suited him; it was his way of 
expressing himself. With a couple of exceptions, Moody Blue (1977) features 
mostly ballads of heartache, hopeless relationships, and lost love. The 
autobiographical relevance of the songs to Elvis’s circumstances makes 
this album, released just a short time before his death, poignant and heart-
breaking. Take a look at the tracks he chose for this last album:
 
✓ “Unchained Melody”
 
✓ “If You Love Me (Let Me Know)”
 
✓ “Little Darlin’”
 
✓ “He’ll Have to Go”
 
✓ “Let Me Be There”
 
✓ “Way Down”
 
✓ “Pledging My Love”
 
✓ “Moody Blue”
 
✓ “She Thinks I Still Care”
 
✓ “It’s Easy for You”
Moody Blue reached number three on the list of Top LPs, charting for 31 
weeks. It was certified platinum on September 1, 1977.
 
The original pressing of Moody Blue produced 200,000 copies on blue translu-
cent vinyl. RCA experimented with green, red, and gold vinyl, but they were 
quickly discarded for the blue — an obvious choice considering the album’s 
title. After the initial pressing sold out, RCA chose the customary black vinyl 
for the next run, but then it later returned to blue. Fans referred to this LP as 
the “Blue Album,” which is appropriate not only for its physical color but also 
for Elvis’s frame of mind.
August 16, 1977: Last Stop 
on the Mystery Train
Elvis Presley died at Graceland on August 16, 1977, at 42 years old. His last girl-
friend, 21-year-old Ginger Alden, found him slumped over in the bathroom. She 
called for Elvis’s longtime friend and right-hand man Joe Esposito, who phoned 
for the paramedics. Amidst growing chaos at Graceland, the paramedics failed 
to revive Elvis, and he was taken to Baptist Memorial Hospital where further 
attempts to resuscitate him failed. He was pronounced dead by his physician,

Dr. George Nichopoulos, who listed the official cause of death as “cardiac 
arrhythmia due to undetermined heartbeat,” which is also known as erratic 
heartbeat. (Chapter 17 further discusses the cause of death.) Dr. Nick then 
took the long ride back to Graceland to find Vernon Presley and tell a father 
that his son was dead. 
This section describes the immediate events surrounding the death of Elvis 
Presley and his funeral.
Shocking the world with the news
Almost immediately after he died, rumors of Elvis’s demise arrived at 
Memphis newspaper offices and radio and television newsrooms. However, 
the jaded local reporters took a wait-and-see attitude. Many of them had 
heard these rumors before. Over the years, many crank calls had come into 
the newsroom declaring that Elvis had been killed in a car accident or a plane 
crash, or that he had been shot by the jealous boyfriend of a woman who was 
hopelessly infatuated with the singer. Once, someone reported that Elvis had 
drowned in a submarine.
Elvis Presley was a hometown boy and a constant source of news, some of 
which was manufactured for or by the Memphis press. Newspaper editors 
and newsroom managers were cautious about sending out their reporters, 
because the rumor that Elvis was dead could be just another hoax. But when 
the staff of the Memphis Press-Scimitar learned from a trusted source that 
Elvis actually was dead, the newsroom grew unusually silent.
Dan Sears of radio station WMPS in Memphis made the first official announce-
ment, and WHBQ-TV was the first television station to interrupt its program-
ming with the terrible news. The story then reached the major networks who 
revealed the news to the rest of the country.
Headlines from August 1977
Elvis’s death made headlines all over the world; 
some of them were almost poetic. Here are a 
few for you to consider:
 ✓ “Death Captures Crown of Rock and Roll” 
— Commercial Appeal
 ✓ “A Lonely Life Ends on Elvis Presley 
Boulevard” — Memphis Press-Scimitar
 ✓ “The King Is Dead” — Tupelo Daily Journal
 ✓ “All Roads Lead to Memphis” — London 
Evening Standard
 ✓ “L’adieu a Elvis” — France-Soir
 ✓ “Elvis: End of an Era” — City Memphis
 ✓ “Elvis Has Left the Building” — Stereo

 Chapter 15: Fading Away
As reports of Elvis’s death spread across the country, radio stations immedi-
ately began to play his records. Some stations quickly organized tributes to the 
singer while others simply played his music at the request of listeners, many of 
whom were in a state of shock by the announcement of his sudden death.
By the end of the day on August 16, fans had already begun to gather at the 
gates of Graceland to say goodbye. The next day, Vernon allowed as many 
fans as possible to file by the casket to view the body. Many who couldn’t be 
there sent flowers, including the hundreds of fan clubs from all over the 
world. The fans sent a tremendous array of flowers, which were set out along 
the bank in front of the mansion. Besides the more traditional wreaths and 
bouquets, the arrangements were shaped like lightning bolts, guitars, hound 
dogs, and stars. Many of the arrangements were sent immediately to Forest 
Hill Cemetery, the site of the burial, where they shared space with more 
humble arrangements of wildflowers in Coke bottles.
 
Every blossom in Memphis had been sold by the afternoon of August 17, and 
so additional flowers had to be shipped in from other parts of the country. 
August 17 was the biggest day in the history of FTD, a florists’ delivery service. 
FTD employees claim that more than 2,150 arrangements were delivered on 
that day.
Preparing a Southern-style funeral
Elvis’s body returned to Graceland on August 17 to lay in state in the living 
room. For the next two days, Shelby County sheriff deputies and Air National 
Guard sentries lined the driveway at Graceland as an honor guard — a 
gesture that Elvis would have appreciated.
Friends and family paid their respects in private that evening, while two 
members of the Memphis Mafia — Sam Thompson and Dick Grob — stood 
watch over Elvis’s body. Among the many who paid their respects was soul 
singer James Brown, who had known Elvis since 1966. Brown took the death 
hard and sat alone with Elvis for a long time.
Elvis’s funeral took place on August 18, 1977, in the living room at Graceland. 
A handful of celebrities attended, including Caroline Kennedy, country-music 
guitarist Chet Atkins, performers Ann-Margret and George Hamilton, former 
Sun Records owner Sam Phillips, and television evangelist Rex Humbard, who 
was one of the speakers during the service. Colonel Parker stood to the side 
dressed in a Hawaiian shirt for reasons known only to himself. Comedian 
Jackie Kahane, who had opened many of Elvis’s concert performances, 
delivered his eulogy, and local minister C.W. Bradley conducted the religious 
service. Elvis’s soprano Kathy Westmoreland sang during the service as did 
gospel performers Jake Hess, J.D. Sumner, and James Blackwood, along with 
their respective vocal groups.

Part III: From the Las Vegas Stage to the End of the Road 
A long motor cortege of 17 all-white automobiles escorted the casket to 
Forest Hill Cemetery, where a five-minute service officially concluded the 
funeral. Later, the bodies of Elvis and his mother would be reinterred at 
Graceland. (See Chapter 16 for more info on Elvis’s final resting place.)
The King is dead, long live the King
 
Throughout August, hundreds of editorials attempted to summarize Elvis’s 
place in our culture. For the first time, the nation as a whole seemed to realize 
that Elvis was an important figure because he changed the way we looked, the 
music we listened to, the way we talked, and the image we identified with. At 
the time, many wrote that Elvis’s death marked the end of an era, as well as 
the end of a legendary career, but this statement hasn’t proved to be true. 
After Elvis died, the legend evolved into a mythology, which continues to grow 
with each new revelation about his personal life and each new reinterpreta-
tion of his contribution to popular culture. Elvis the man died on August 16, 
1977, but Elvis the myth continues . . .

lvis died on August 16, 1977, but he still hasn’t left

spotlight on the singer, resulting in continued interest in 
the man and his music.
A prosperous industry has developed around Elvis’s home, 
Graceland, which opened to the public in 1982, giving fans 
and tourists a centralized location to gather and celebrate 
all things Elvis. In addition, albums and compilations of his 
music continue to be released to introduce Elvis to younger 
generations, while biographies, documentaries, and even 
college courses attempt to explain his significance and 
continued popularity.
In this part, I offer you an overview of the world of Elvis, 
including Graceland, the fans, recent album releases, 
biographies, and other parts of the phenomenon that 
help make Elvis the highest-earning celebrity almost

Chapter 16
In the Aftermath of Death
In This Chapter
▶ Noting the transfer of Elvis’s body to Meditation Garden
▶ Considering the fan-based rituals that developed after Elvis’s death
T
hough Elvis died on August 16, 1977, fans still wanted to feel connected 
to their idol. So they engaged in activities that were repeated regularly 
over time until they became rituals. These post-death rituals essentially 
replaced the in-concert routines enacted between the fans and Elvis during 
the 1970s. (See Chapter 13 for a complete account of the in-concert rituals.) 
These fan rituals represent one part of the Elvis Presley phenomenon that 
begins in the aftermath of his death and increases in scale and scope as the 
years go by. (The other chapters in this part introduce you to other aspects 
of the phenomenon.)
The most extensive fan ritual is the slate of activities known as Elvis Week. 
This celebration of Presley’s life and music occurs every August on the anni-
versary of his death. The highlight of the week is a specific ritual known as 
the Candlelight Vigil, which is a moving tribute to Elvis in which fans sol-
emnly walk by his gravesite in Meditation Garden with candles in hand.
Strangely enough, this ritual wouldn’t have started without the odd event 
that occurred just after his funeral. Four people threatened to steal Elvis’s 
body, resulting in the removal of the body from a mausoleum in Forest Hill 
Cemetery. The body was then buried behind Graceland in the small area 
known as Meditation Garden.
This chapter details the development of Elvis Week and its many celebrations 
and rituals, beginning with an event that was indirectly connected to the 
Candlelight Vigil.

Moving Elvis to Meditation Garden
 
On August 29, less than two weeks after Elvis died, four young Memphis men 
attempted to steal Elvis’s body from the mausoleum in Forest Hill Cemetery 
and hold it for ransom. In a comedy of errors that probably would have made 
Elvis himself laugh, the culprits were caught in the act at the cemetery. 
Because of this incident, the bodies of Elvis and his mother were moved to 
the garden area behind Graceland. This new burial site eventually enabled the 
start of the Candlelight Vigil, which is now held annually on the eve of the 
anniversary of Elvis’s death.
Thieves in the night
The body-snatching escapade was foiled almost from the beginning when 
an informant tipped police that someone would attempt to steal Elvis’s 
body. After learning of the tip, police staked out Forest Hill Cemetery for 
three nights. On one of those nights, they spotted four men investigating the 
mausoleum and the surrounding area, but the group didn’t attempt a 
break-in.
However, the four returned two nights later just after midnight by climbing 
over a fence at the rear of the cemetery. As they tampered with the mauso-
leum, a car passed by on a nearby highway, inadvertently shining its head-
lights toward the suspects. The group freaked out and darted across the 
cemetery, racing over graves and monuments. Three of the would-be thieves 
jumped into a car and sped away, only to be picked up by the police waiting 
nearby. The fourth suspect scaled the fence but injured his leg in the process. 
Police nabbed him at a local hospital when he showed up for treatment.
The runaway suspect wasn’t charged, but the other three were arrested and 
charged with criminal trespassing.
Meditation Garden
Meditation Garden, a serene setting behind 
Graceland, was inspired by Elvis’s interest in 
religion and spirituality, particularly after he 
attended the Self-Realization Fellowship in Los 
Angeles. The columns and arbor were already 
in place when the Presleys moved in, but Elvis 
commissioned the construction of the rest of the 
Garden in 1965. The plans called for a wall of 
Mexican brick with stained-glass windows, a 
small, round pool with fountains, sidewalks, 
statues, landscaping, and even a sound system. 
Elvis built Meditation Garden as a retreat for pri-
vate prayer and contemplation; he had no idea 
that it would become his final resting place.

251
 Chapter 16: In the Aftermath of Death
Coming home to Graceland one last time
Elvis’s father, Vernon Presley, originally wanted to inter his son on the grounds 
of Graceland, but the city of Memphis wouldn’t grant the proper permits to 
allow it. (You can read more about Graceland and its significance in Chapter 
19.) The attempted theft of Elvis’s body helped changed the minds of city 
officials, however. The disturbance created in Forest Hill Cemetery by the 
thousands of fans trampling through the graveyard, causing congestion and 
destruction, also worked in Vernon’s favor.
In the fall, Elvis returned home to rest in Meditation Garden just behind the 
house. Vernon ordered four graves to be dug, burying Elvis in one and his 
wife, Gladys, in another. Two years later, Vernon died and was laid to rest 
beside them. Finally, in 1980, Vernon’s mother, Minnie Mae, who endured 
the deaths of her son, daughter-in-law, and grandson, was laid to rest in the 
fourth plot. The four family members are together in death just as they had 
lived together for much of their lives. To see the graves at Meditation Garden, 
refer to the color photo section.
The tiny family graveyard that takes up a large part of Meditation Garden 
proved to be the perfect place for fans to express their devotion, sadness, 
and feelings of loss. Vernon opened the Garden in November 1977 for fans to 
visit and pay their respects to Elvis, but the rest of Graceland wasn’t open 
to the public until 1982.
Establishing New Rituals
Fans planted the seeds for Elvis Week one year after his death when many of 
them informally met in Memphis to commemorate the one-year anniversary 
of his passing. Several random events were planned by different Memphis 
venues so that fans had something to do with their time, but none of these 
events were connected. As the years passed, the number of activities during 
Elvis Week grew in scope and complexity, which drew more and more fans to 
Memphis. For the most part, the activities weren’t connected, and an infor-
mality marks the events during these formative years. Early on, fans referred 
to the commemoration as Elvis Week, and the name stuck.
 
Nothing jumpstarted the growth of Elvis Week like the opening of Graceland 
to the public in June 1982. Touring Graceland became a focal point for fan 
activities, culminating with the Candlelight Vigil. With access to Graceland, 
fans had a central location to rally around, and it soon became the place to 
organize their anniversary celebrations.
This section chronicles the development of Elvis Week from a simple 
informal celebration to a huge extravaganza of events and concerts.

Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
Gathering at the gates
While Elvis lived in Memphis, fans habitually gathered at the Music Gates at 
Graceland and waited to catch a glimpse of the King. When fans came from 
out of town, they immediately went to the gates to get the scoop on Elvis’s 
whereabouts from other fans.
Within an hour of Elvis’s death on August 16, 1977, fans began to flock to the 
gates not only to pay their respects but also to check in with each other. As 
the hours ticked by, fans from outside Memphis started to arrive. When they 
heard the news, they hurried their children into their cars and drove toward 
Graceland. Most fans hadn’t made arrangements to stay in a motel after they 
arrived in Memphis; many hadn’t even packed a change of clothes.
Reporters on the scene marveled at the growing crowd, repeatedly asking 
the fans why they had come. Most were unable to articulate an answer that 
would satisfy the dumbfounded reporters. They could only mutter that they 
had to come to be close to Elvis. By the next morning, the crowd numbered 
20,000. The Memphis police repeatedly overestimated crowd totals until they 
were telling the press that the crowd consisted of 60,000 to 80,000 Elvis fans.
Elvis’s body lay in state in the living room of Graceland, and Vernon opted for 
a public viewing. The doors opened in the morning and closed at 6:30 p.m., 
but so many mourners arrived that it was impossible for all of them to be 
admitted to Graceland. In fact, the mob grew so large that a carnival atmo-
sphere developed. People hawking T-shirts and souvenirs worked the crowd. 
The hot Memphis weather and the close crush of people caused many people 
to faint. Luckily a medic was on hand to tend to the overheated. The fans 
who were unable to get inside Graceland consoled each other by exchanging 
anecdotes about Elvis.
Returning to Memphis
 
A year after Elvis’s death, many fans journeyed to Memphis to stand in front of 
Graceland. Led by the Texas Country Elvis Presley Fan Club, the group of fans 
lit candles by the gates to pay their respects. This impromptu event was the 
inspiration for the Candlelight Vigil. (Refer to the later section “Establishing 
Elvis Week” for more on this vigil.)
Several unrelated events were scheduled in Memphis to acknowledge the 
one-year anniversary of Elvis’s passing. The Memphian Theater, which 
Elvis had frequently rented for after-hours showings of movies for his family 
and friends, offered a mini-retrospective of the most well-known Presley 
Travelogues. (Flip to Chapter 8 to read more about the Travelogues.) Pop 
artist Andy Warhol attended the opening of an art exhibition at the Brooks 
Memorial Art Gallery featuring his painting “Elvis Forty-Nine Times.”

253
 Chapter 16: In the Aftermath of Death
The week was marked not so much by these events but by unforeseen cir-
cumstances that made the first anniversary memorable for the wrong 
reasons. A strike by the police and fire departments forced the city to call out 
the National Guard, who instituted a curfew that caused the cancellation of 
some of the planned events. The high point of the week (or maybe the low 
point, depending on how you look at it) occurred when a drunken electric 
company employee accidentally knocked out the city’s power supply.
Journalists were attracted to the chaos and descended on the city to report 
on the labor problems as well as the influx of Presley fans. The press painted 
a picture of obsessed fans who didn’t want to accept the reality that Elvis 
was dead, and they depicted Memphis as a faded Southern city past its glory.
 
In August 1978, The New York Times, which has a long tradition of disparaging 
Elvis and his fans (a tradition that goes all the way back to 1956), smugly 
remarked, “Which will seem more absurd to students of our time, the nation-
wide flap in the 1950’s that kept Elvis Presley’s gyrating hips from being 
televised or the hysteria with which his fans this week commemorated the 
first anniversary of his death?”
The second anniversary in Memphis was calm in comparison to the year 
before. Fans arrived to attend various memorial services, and Memphis State 
University presented a series of seminars on Elvis and his music. These 
seminars represented early academic efforts to put Presley’s contributions 
to American history and culture into perspective. Fan clubs scheduled 
events for the week, but they didn’t coordinate with each other in advance, 
so activities were disorganized and conflicted with each other. Fans were 
forced to choose one event over another.
The Colonel attempts to run the show
Elvis’s manager, Colonel Tom Parker, had con-
trolled his client’s career since 1955, and he 
was still managing it in death. A month after the 
first-anniversary debacle in Memphis (see the 
section “Returning to Memphis” for more), 
Parker attempted to launch an official celebra-
tion in Las Vegas called “Always Elvis.” The 
highlight was the unveiling of a statue of the 
King by sculptor Carl Romanelli at the Hilton in 
front of their newly dedicated “Elvis Presley 
Showroom.” Interspersed among the Elvis 
memorabilia were booths of souvenirs for sale 
at inflated prices. And fans could see Presley’s 
plane, the Lisa Marie, at the Las Vegas Airport 
for a $5 fee. A weary Vernon Presley attended, 
looking lost as RCA presented him with 15 gold 
and platinum records in recognition of post-
death sales.
The Colonel had lost favor with the fans, so the 
event was poorly attended. A second “Always 
Elvis” festival never came to pass. Instead fans 
showed up in Memphis in August 1979 to com-
memorate the death of Elvis in their own way.

254
Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
After the second anniversary, fans, city officials, and the Estate of Elvis 
Presley realized that Memphis in August had become a mecca for Elvis 
devotees. At this point, the city and the Estate began to expect the fans 
each August, planning events and gearing up for an influx of people.
Establishing Elvis Week
In 1980, a few fan clubs organized several events in mid-August as a way to 
commemorate Elvis Presley’s life and music. These events became the 
real start of Elvis Week. That year, Bill Burk, a reporter for the Memphis 
Press-Scimitar who had often interviewed Presley, offered to help schedule 
the fan club events to avoid conflicts. The events ran smoothly, and Burk 
repeated his role as coordinator in 1981.
The Estate jumps on the Elvis Week bandwagon
 
In May 1982, Graceland opened to the public. (See Chapter 19 for more infor-
mation on the decision by Elvis Presley Enterprises, also known as the Estate, 
to open Graceland for public viewing.) The Estate hadn’t been involved in 
any anniversary events up to that point, and it hadn’t reached out to the 
fans since Elvis’s death. Nonetheless, in 1982, the Estate attempted to take 
ownership of Elvis Week, noting that it was the fifth anniversary of Presley’s 
death and that large crowds were expected. The Estate’s attitude didn’t sit 
well with the fans, who believed that Elvis Week belonged to them because 
their efforts had initiated it. To varying degrees, this hostility between the 
Estate and the fans still exists. The tension is caused by a combination of 
slights and miscalculations over the years.
 
The operations manager of Elvis’s Estate called a meeting with the Memphis 
Convention and Visitors Bureau and reporter Bill Burk. In this meeting, the 
operations manager declared that from 1982 onward the anniversary week 
commemorating Elvis would be called Elvis Presley International Tribute 
Week (or EPITW). Considering that the name “Elvis Week” still stands, you can 
guess how well the Estate’s idea went over.
Even though fans were less than enthusiastic about the Estate’s involvement, 
opening part of the house and grounds to the public did pull the Estate into 
the anniversary celebration in a more high-profile way. After all, fans did 
want to see the place where Elvis lived and breathed. So touring Graceland 
became a central part of the Elvis Week experience.
A tradition is formed
From about 1982 to the mid-1990s, Elvis Week was an inexpensive, informal, 
laid-back celebration for fans and anyone else who was attracted to the 
phenomena that Elvis was generating in death. Each year, the Estate staged a 

255
 Chapter 16: In the Aftermath of Death
few events and the fan clubs staged a few as well. The festivities lasted about 
five to seven days. If any of the events had an admission fee, the proceeds 
most likely went to charity, which was in keeping with Elvis’s charitable 
nature. The pace of the week was leisurely, so participants had plenty of time 
and energy to participate in (and enjoy!) the many events.
Die-hard and casual fans alike attended Elvis Week. Fans were looking to 
connect with friends or to reconnect with Elvis through concerts, exhibits, 
and visits to Graceland, Sun Studio, his birthplace in Tupelo, and other 
familiar Elvis haunts.
 
If you were an Elvis fan who attended Elvis Week in 1992, you had this list of 
activities (and more!) to choose from:
 
✓ Memphis Bandstand ’92 Sock Hop: Organized by the Estate, this huge 
concert at Mid-South Coliseum featured many acts from the 1950s and 
1960s who were still performing, including the Shirelles, Dickey Lee, Billy 
Swan, Johnny Tillotson, and Andy Childs. Proceeds from the concert 
went to Goodwill Homes and Final Net.
 
✓ A gospel concert: J. D. Sumner and the Stamps Quartet and James 
Blackwood, gospel singers whom Elvis knew personally, headed the 
bill for this program designed as a memorial to Presley. Proceeds also 
benefited Goodwill Homes and Final Net.
 
✓ An Elvis trivia contest: This free two-day event sponsored by Graceland 
offered prizes to participants who showed off their knowledge of all 
things Elvis in Graceland Plaza, which was across the street from the 
main house.
 
✓ Fan Appreciation Social: Graceland hosted this free event at a local 
hotel to reach out to the fans in the way that Elvis and Colonel Tom 
Parker always had.
 
✓ Elvis video nights: No reservations were necessary for this series of 
free showings of concert films featuring Elvis.
 
✓ Tours of Humes High School: Tours of the high school that Elvis 
attended were offered by the school for a small fee of $2, which 
helped with upkeep of the building. Still in operation, Humes is now a 
junior high.
 
✓ Elvis Presley Memorial Auction & Lunch: A favorite event for fans, 
this auction and flea market–style sale of Elvis memorabilia was held to 
benefit Le Bonheur Children’s Medical Center.
 
✓ Elvis World breakfasts: Hosted by Bill Burk of Elvis World magazine, 
these breakfasts featured talks by authors of books about Elvis. 
Attendees had the opportunity to have books autographed as well.

Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
In addition to the staged events, fans also migrated in the evenings to the 
outdoor pools at the Days Inn at Brooks Road and Howard Johnson’s on 
Elvis Presley Boulevard. There they exchanged memories and renewed 
friendships. The Days Inn featured a window-decorating contest, in which 
visitors decorated the windows of their motel rooms with Elvis-related 
images. The contest became one of the most popular attractions of Elvis 
Week. To the fans, Elvis Week had become a social occasion with the feel 
of a family reunion. Seeing familiar faces and attending familiar events 
contributed to the relaxed, friendly atmosphere.
 
By 1982, the Candlelight Vigil had been established as the emotional high 
point of Elvis Week. This event still takes place in the same form each year. 
On the evening of August 15, fans gather in front of the Music Gates. Elvis’s 
music is piped over a loudspeaker as people mingle and swap Elvis stories 
before lining up along the graffiti-covered wall. Around 11 p.m., two or more 
Graceland employees walk down to the gates with a torch that has been lit by 
the eternal flame near Elvis’s grave. As the gates open, the fans, each with 
their own lighted candle, climb silently and reverently up the hill behind the 
house, where they walk single file past the grave site. The procession often 
takes as long as six hours to pass through Meditation Garden.
Bill Burk and Elvis World
Reporter Bill Burk knew Elvis Presley for almost 
20 years, and he wrote close to 400 newspaper 
articles and columns about him for the Memphis 
Press-Scimitar. He made friends with most of 
Elvis’s associates and family members, which 
gave him access to stories that most other pub-
lications didn’t have. Vernon Presley once 
remarked that the best articles on his son had 
been written by Burk.
In 1986, after six years of helping fan clubs 
coordinate events during Elvis Week, Burk 
launched Elvis World, a Memphis-based 
subscription-based newsletter for fans all over 
the world. Burk proudly proclaimed that his 
readership included former President Bill 
Clinton, Raisa Gorbachev (the wife of a Russian 
premier), former Russian Premier Boris Yeltsin, 
and Japanese President Junichiro Koizumi.
Burk wrote more than a dozen books on Elvis, 
priding himself on uncovering original research 
that often changed popular misconceptions 
about Presley. He tracked down rare stories 
and photos from people who knew Elvis in child-
hood, some of whom had never been inter-
viewed before. Burk debunked many myths 
about Elvis, including the story that he had been 
working as a truck driver when he recorded his 
first song at the Memphis Recording Service 
(see Chapter 2). Sadly, Burk passed away in 
2008, and Elvis World ceased to publish. Both 
are sorely missed by the Elvis community.

257
 Chapter 16: In the Aftermath of Death
The evolution of Elvis Week
Over the years, Memphis has taken advantage of Graceland and Elvis Week 
to promote its history, musical heritage, and rich Southern culture. In addi-
tion, each significant anniversary — such as the 20th in 1997, the 25th in 
2002, and the 30th in 2007 — brought more extravagant programs and events 
from Graceland. The length of Elvis Week extended so that the occasion 
lasted seven to ten days, and the pace of the celebration picked up as more 
activities and larger-scale events were added.
Another shift in attitude and direction occurred in 2005 when controlling 
interest in Elvis Presley Enterprises (the Estate) was taken over by CKX, Inc., 
which is owned by financial wizard Robert F. X. Sillerman. (CKX also owns 
the American Idol television series along with other entertainment enter-
prises.) The corporatizing of Elvis Presley Enterprises has increased revenue 
by further commercializing Elvis’s image on additional products, encouraging 
the broader marketing of his music, developing new videos and documenta-
ries, placing more value on memorabilia, and creating plans to capitalize on 
Elvis’s European fans.
The landscape of Memphis and the area surrounding Graceland also has 
changed over the years. The tourism revenue brought into Memphis by 
Elvis’s fans revitalized the clubs and restaurants on Beale Street, creating a 
thriving night life where there wasn’t one in the 1980s. (Chapter 2 discusses 
the infamous Beale Street in more detail.) The Estate bought out the motels, 
gift shops, and souvenir stands across the street from Graceland and 
replaced them with its own shops and museums. Sadly, the historic Days 
Inn and Howard Johnson’s motel are no longer there.
The new sophistication and organization behind Elvis Week appeals to an 
international crowd, youthful fans who aren’t interested in the family atmo-
sphere of past years, and a broader range of tourists. However, higher-priced 
events, a faster pace, and a glitzy atmosphere have been difficult for tradi-
tional fans who miss the informality of the old days.
 
If you were a fan who attended the 2007 Elvis Week, you were likely over-
whelmed by the nine days of activities and celebrations to choose from. While 
some of these activities were familiar fan club events, with an emphasis on 
charity donations, the scale and glamour of the new events signaled a contem-
porary approach to Elvis Week. Here’s a rundown of some of the events:
 
✓ Elvis Presley International 5K Run: Almost 2,000 fans and runners 
participated in the race and the post-race party across from Graceland. 
Registration to participate was $25 with proceeds benefiting United 
Cerebral Palsy.

Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
 
✓ The premier of Elvis Presley: His Home, His Story: Graceland pre-
miered its new documentary at Memphis’s Malco Theater. The event 
wasn’t free, and proceeds didn’t go to charity.
 
✓ Meetup at Marlowe’s Restaurant: This fan-organized event, which 
benefits the Memphis Humane Society, is one of the oldest still on the 
schedule.
 
✓ Elvis Gospel Breakfast: Instead of live gospel performers, this event 
hosted by the Estate was held at Graceland Plaza across the street from 
the main house. For $33, fans enjoyed brunch and a morning of watching 
videos of Elvis singing gospel music.
 
✓ Music and Movies at Graceland: For two evenings, Elvis’s movies were 
shown on the lawn at Graceland, including Jailhouse Rock and Elvis: 
That’s the Way It Is. Admission for each Music and Movies at Graceland 
event was $44. A ticket for both nights cost fans $75.
 
✓ Malco Theatre’s Elvis Film Fest 5: In contrast to Graceland’s Music and 
Movie Nights, the budget-conscious fan could see five of Elvis’s films for 
$5 per movie at the Malco Theatre. Proceeds went to a charity named 
after Todd Morgan, the late manager of Graceland who was well liked by 
fans. Morgan died unexpectedly in 2007.
 
✓ Elvis Expo: The memorabilia auction and flea market has been renamed 
Elvis Expo. It also was expanded to two days and moved to the Memphis 
Cook Conventions Center. Now dubbed a trade show, the expo features 
about 75 booths of Elvis merchandise — as opposed to true memorabilia.
 
✓ Showing of Elvis: From Broadway to Memphis: The Broadway cast of 
the hit play All Shook Up, which was based on Elvis’s music, performed 
with the Memphis Symphony Orchestra. In addition, video footage of 
Elvis performing was accompanied by live music on the stage. Tickets 
ranged from $30 to $125, and nothing went to charity.
 
The evolution of Elvis Week from the fan-dominated era to the contemporary 
Estate-controlled extravaganza is evident when comparing events from the 
past and present. You can find virtues and disadvantages to both approaches 
to Elvis Week. The emphasis on professional entertainment brings in new fans 
and tourists, but the traditional fans feel pushed out of the commemorative 
occasion they began. No matter how you look at it, the highlight of this annual 
week-long celebration remains the Candlelight Vigil, which now streams live 
on the Internet. This moving tribute brings together the past and present and 
reminds all fans, tourists, and attendees what Elvis Week is all about.

Examining the Jokes, Stereotypes, 
and Negative Influences
In This Chapter
▶ Reviewing Elvis’s treatment by the press
▶ Looking at the marketing of Elvis’s image
▶ Assessing the personal biographies of Elvis
▶ Considering the Elvis impersonators
E
ven long after his death, Elvis continues to attract a following from 
die-hard fans to casual enthusiasts. (You can read more about the depth 
of fan devotion to the singer in Chapter 16.) However, theirs is not the only 
perspective on Elvis Presley. Others, including the media, former friends and 
associates, and commercial marketers, have different perceptions of Elvis, 
and their perspectives affect the views of the general public — and often 
negatively.
Adding to the public’s tendency to underestimate Elvis is the impression 
created by the impersonators, sometimes called “tribute artists.” The imper-
sonators love Elvis and most believe that they’re honoring his memory, but 
many lack sufficient musical talent to perform his songs. The performances 
by those impersonators tend to reflect badly on Elvis’s own talents and 
image, especially when the media exploits their unattractive traits.
This chapter offers an overview of the forces that have painted a negative 
portrait of Elvis over the years. This inaccurate portrait continues to 
interfere with the public’s general understanding of the singer’s amazing 
accomplishments and historical significance. No celebrity of Elvis’s caliber 
and no figure of his cultural significance has been denied his due in the 
same way.
 
The influence of the media, the marketers, and the memoirs by former asso-
ciates complicates the view of Elvis held by the mainstream public, infusing 
his image with doubt, reservations, and ugly stereotypes of bloated superstars 
past their prime. If this sounds like your perception of Elvis Presley, reading 
this book can help you understand why and perhaps change your mind.

Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
Bashing Elvis: The Press versus Presley
Mainstream newspapers and magazines, television news programs, talk 
shows, and other information outlets, have rarely treated Elvis Presley 
with the same reverence afforded other pop culture icons. (See Chapters 
5, 7, 14, and 15 for detailed accounts of press coverage of Elvis over his 
career.)
In general, the press has been critical, clueless, or contemptuous when 
writing about Elvis Presley. In the 1950s, he was attacked for singing rock ’n’ 
roll instead of pop; conversely in the 1970s, he was demeaned for singing 
melodramatic ballads that weren’t in the rock style of the era. Some writers 
went beyond that level of criticism to be downright mean-spirited in their 
comments about the singer, his appearance, and his fans. In the 1950s, he 
was frequently called by the pejorative term “hillbilly” and described with 
words that equate him with animals — as when Life magazine called him a 
“21-year-old hillbilly, who howls, mumbles, coos, and cries. . . .” In the 1970s, 
writers seemed almost angry that Elvis and his fans were growing older. A 
low point was when his hometown newspaper, the Memphis Commercial 
Appeal, called him “fat and forty” and “sold out.”
 
Just two weeks before Elvis died in 1977, an exposé by his former bodyguards — 
titled Elvis: What Happened? — accused Elvis of drug abuse and other image-
busting transgressions. So when Elvis died, obituaries, columns, and other 
reactions to his untimely death were distracted by these negative revelations. 
Most of these post-death reactions failed to adequately assess Elvis’s cultural 
contributions; instead, they exploited the scandal. The accusations seemed to 
“prove” the perspective that the media held about Elvis all along — that he was 
an anomaly in entertainment history who didn’t deserve the attention and 
devotion of those who bought his records, went to his movies, or attended his 
concerts.
Drugs, weight, and other scandals had swirled around other superstars, 
including Judy Garland and Marilyn Monroe, but their problems were never 
used as fodder for jokes on late-night television or used to suggest that their 
star status wasn’t deserved.
The negative perception by the media sharpened after Elvis’s death as 
more revelations about his tragic lifestyle and drug abuse surfaced. As the 
years went by, fans and other followers continued to express devotion and 
appreciation, but the media tended to home in on any story that treated 
Elvis like he was the subject of a black velvet painting — tacky, superficial, 
and tasteless.

261
 Chapter 17: Examining the Jokes, Stereotypes, and Negative Influences
Shaping early opinions: 
The bodyguard book
On August 1, 1977, just 15 days before Elvis died, Ballantine Books published 
a memoir put together by New York Post columnist and former National 
Enquirer reporter Steve Dunleavy. It consisted of interviews with three of 
Elvis’s former bodyguards — Red West, Sonny West, and Dave Hebler. 
The three men were the first to come forward with stories of Elvis’s bizarre 
lifestyle. Elvis: What Happened? included accounts of his mood swings, 
relationships with women, and excessive use of prescription drugs.
The book received little publicity until Bob Greene, a columnist for the 
Chicago Sun-Times and a lifelong Elvis fan, interviewed Sonny West for his 
syndicated column. Greene was curious about the book’s allegations and 
wanted to know why the bodyguards had written it. He decided to go straight 
to the horse’s mouth. By coincidence, the column ran on the day Elvis died 
(August 16, 1977). Greene’s column provoked a lot of protest from fans 
across the country, and the “bodyguard book” (as it has since been dubbed) 
inspired the wrath of many, including Geraldo Rivera, who blasted Dunleavy 
on Good Morning America for smearing Elvis’s name.
The bodyguards’ story had been difficult to believe for several reasons. 
Nothing like it had surfaced on a wide scale before, because the Colonel had 
been able to keep Elvis’s increasingly eccentric behavior out of the press. 
Also, Dunleavy lacked credibility as an objective biographer. He had been a 
reporter for the supermarket tabloid The Star when he started working on the 
book about Elvis, and he was working for the less-than-respected newspaper 
the New York Post when Elvis: What Happened? was published. Despite 
Dunleavy’s less-than-stellar credentials, Elvis’s death seemed to validate the 
bodyguards’ book.
 
The bodyguard book influenced the coverage of Elvis’s death and funeral, 
stealing the spotlight from the singer’s legacy and historical significance — as 
evidenced by the NBC news documentary. Not every obituary, special edition 
newspaper, or follow-up article in the weeks to come made direct reference to 
drugs and scandal, but many did, tainting the coverage with accusation, 
morbid curiosity, and condemnation.
 
Contrary to most journalists, Charles Kuralt waxed eloquently about the 
meaning of Elvis Presley to America. Sadly, few others followed his lead. On a 
CBS news special that aired on August 18, 1977, Kuralt noted, “But it’s hard to 
imagine Elvis Presley’s success coming anywhere but here. He molded it out 
of so many American elements: country and blues and gospel and rock; a little 
Memphis, a little Vegas, a little arrogance, a little piety . . . How could we ever 
have felt estranged from Elvis? He was a native son.”

Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
Revealing the ugly truth: 
Elvis’s drug abuse
Over the next two years, reports of Elvis’s drug abuse and its role in his 
death surfaced occasionally, but no definitive ruling was established. Medical 
examiner Dr. Jerry Francisco had publicly declared that drugs hadn’t played 
a part in Elvis’s death, but the autopsy findings were kept private at Vernon’s 
request. (See Chapter 15 for more information on the events related to Elvis’s 
death.) Many fans refused to believe the sordid stories, and several show-
business acquaintances, including producer Hal Wallis, came to his defense.
In 1979, controversial journalist Geraldo Rivera and his producer Charles 
Thompson, who also worked for the television news magazine 20/20, aired a 
report titled “The Elvis Cover-Up.” Rivera wanted to get to the bottom of all 
the rumors and hearsay regarding Elvis’s life and death, though he didn’t 
intend to further sully the singer’s reputation. This report marked the first 
national media attention on the singer’s drug use. Representatives of ABC 
Media blunders after Elvis’s death
The critically acclaimed book When Elvis Died, 
which was published in 1992 by Neal and Janice 
Gregory, chronicles the coverage of Elvis by the 
media in the days after he died. The book is a 
fascinating study of the media’s handling of a 
major event in popular culture and a window 
into media prejudices and weaknesses.
One of the most revealing parts of the book 
details the way the news departments of the 
three major television networks reported the 
death of Elvis Presley on August 16. NBC and 
ABC chose to lead off with the story during their 
evening news programs and then to air a spe-
cial late-night news documentary about the 
singer’s life. However, the producers at CBS 
completely underestimated the importance of 
Elvis’s death and ran the story after the second 
commercial break during the CBS Nightly News. 
Then the network chose not to prepare a spe-
cial late-night documentary. CBS’s evening 
news was the leading news program during the 
1970s, but the show’s ratings fell dramatically 
after viewers switched to the other networks 
when CBS didn’t lead Nightly News with the 
story of Elvis’s death. Executives realized they 
had miscalculated the importance of Elvis to his 
fans and underestimated the fascination of his 
death to the public, so they aired a special news 
documentary on the night of his funeral.
Other news organizations also undervalued 
Elvis Presley and his importance to the public. 
The New York Times, which prides itself on pre-
paring prewritten obituaries on every prominent 
person in the world, had nothing for Presley. 
Editors asked one of the few Southerners on the 
staff, Molly Ivens from Texas, to write the obit 
because she talked with an accent. (After all, 
speaking with a Southern accent must mean 
that she knows something about Elvis. How’s 
that for stereotypical?) Associated Press 
reporter Harry Rosenthal, who was working out 
of Washington, D.C., was denied the assign-
ment to cover Elvis’s death and funeral because 
editors told him that it was nothing but a 
“regional” story.

263
 Chapter 17: Examining the Jokes, Stereotypes, and Negative Influences
and 20/20 filed a lawsuit to obtain a copy of the autopsy, but Dr. Francisco 
refused to comply. During the 1980s, the suit made it all the way to the 
Tennessee State Supreme Court, which ruled in Francisco’s favor. In 1991, 
ABC went to court to force Francisco to surrender the autopsy report. 
Two years later, Shelby County officials also filed a lawsuit requesting that 
Francisco surrender the autopsy report. Eventually, Francisco was required 
to give up his autopsy notes, but not the report.
As a result of the publicity over the autopsy, Elvis’s doctor, Dr. George 
Nichopoulos, was brought before the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners 
on several charges involving overprescribing. In January 1980, the board 
suspended his license for more than three months. Unfortunately, the inquiry 
into the doctor’s practices exposed several unsavory facts about Elvis, which 
confirmed his massive drug use. Consider these facts that came to light:
 
✓ Elvis was prescribed more than 12,000 pills and vials of potent drugs 
during the last 20 months of his life.
 
✓ He was hospitalized several times because he was swollen from head to 
toe due to drug misuse.
 
✓ He carried three suitcases full of pills and supplies when he toured, 
which everyone in his entourage used freely.
In November 1981, Nichopoulos, whom Elvis and his entourage called Dr. 
Nick, was officially charged with multiple felony counts of overprescribing 
drugs to numerous patients. News of the shocking number of pills prescribed 
to Elvis was difficult to believe, but Dr. Nichopoulos claimed that he also had 
given Presley placebos in an effort to control the medication. He noted that if 
he refused to give Elvis drugs, the singer simply got the medication from 
another doctor. Dr. Nick was acquitted of the charges. However, five new 
charges of overprescribing for Elvis and others were brought against him 
in 1992 by the state of Tennessee. In 1995, the State Department of Health 
permanently revoked his license.
Caroline Kennedy covers Elvis’s funeral
Rolling Stone hired Caroline Kennedy to write a 
piece related to Elvis’s death, which was pub-
lished in the September 22, 1977, issue. Kennedy 
wasn’t a journalist, had never written for Rolling 
Stone before, and she didn’t know the Presleys. 
The assignment was more like a stunt than a 
sincere effort to cover Elvis’s funeral.
Apparently, no one at Graceland knew she 
was there on the magazine’s behalf, and her 
celebrity status gained her access to Priscilla, 
some of the Memphis Mafia, and a broken-
hearted Vernon Presley. Kennedy didn’t write 
about Elvis’s death nor of his funeral; instead, 
she offered impressions of the activities and 
people inside Graceland as though she were in 
a far-off land watching the strange rituals of an 
exotic (read “Southern”) people.

264
Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
 
After the autopsy findings, revelations by Dr. Nichopoulos on the witness 
stand, and statements by Dr. Eric Muirhead and Dr. Noel Foredo, who were 
present at the autopsy, it became impossible to deny the cause of Elvis’s 
death: polypharmacy, or the interaction of several drugs.
Weighing in on weight
The association between Elvis’s weight and his drug use began almost imme-
diately after his death, and connecting the two topics became a common 
practice. For instance, many magazines ran photos of an overweight Elvis 
with neighboring stories of his drug use, suggesting a bizarre lifestyle of 
excess and self-indulgence that led to artistic decline. The photos were 
always of Elvis on stage in his jumpsuits, because that was his costume style 
of choice during most of the 1970s.
Eventually, any shot of Elvis onstage in a jumpsuit began to signify his drug 
abuse, weight issues, and artistic deterioration. “Vegas Elvis” was often 
contrasted directly or indirectly with his image as a 1950s rock ’n’ roll rebel, 
suggesting that Vegas Elvis was a musical disappointment in comparison to 
Rebel Elvis. By extension, those fans who liked this phase of Elvis’s career 
were stereotyped as those “hysterical” women who had cried their hearts out 
at the gates of Graceland after Elvis died or as working-class stiffs who lacked 
taste and refinement. (Chapter 20 discusses the Vegas Elvis versus Rebel 
Elvis debate in further detail.)
During this time, the prejudice against Elvis’s Southern identity came into 
play in media coverage just as it had in the 1950s. (See Chapter 5 for more 
information on Elvis’s problems with the press during the 1950s.) Members 
of the mainstream media were reluctant to fully explore Elvis’s unprece-
dented success or adequately describe his entire career. Acknowledgements 
of his accomplishments or importance were tempered with descriptions of 
his bizarre life in his Southern mansion in Memphis. In fact, sometimes his 
accomplishments were overlooked altogether in favor of jabs at his fondness 
for Southern-style food.
 
One of the first major sources to exaggerate Elvis’s Southern diet was a light-
hearted but condescending book titled Elvis World by Jane and Michael 
Stern (published in 1987, and not to be confused with Bill Burk’s Elvis World 
magazine). The tongue-in-cheek tone ridiculed Elvis more than it revealed 
anything about him when it included a recipe for his alleged favorite snack, a 
fried peanut butter and banana sandwich. Elvis did eat these sandwiches, but 
it was others who claimed the snack was his favorite.

265
 Chapter 17: Examining the Jokes, Stereotypes, and Negative Influences
As time passed, it became almost obligatory for writers to mention Elvis’s 
love of peanut butter and banana sandwiches, which was inevitably 
described as a Southern treat and discussed as though it were the exotic 
food of some lost native tribe. This type of coverage colored the general 
public’s view of Elvis, robbing him of his legacy as a music pioneer and his 
potency as an icon who changed our social history. Instead he became 
fodder for bad jokes by stand-up comics, newspaper cartoonists, and 
late-night talk-show hosts.
Spreading rumors: Elvis is alive
If you really want to anger one of Elvis’s fans, ask him or her if the King is 
really dead. No other rumor, story, or fad has become more tiresome to fans 
than the saga of a burned-out Elvis faking his death to escape the burdens of 
his life. Similar legends and tall tales had surrounded other famous celebri-
ties, including John Kennedy, James Dean, and Jim Morrison, but those 
stories were romanticized and mythologized in a way that turned the sub-
jects into tragic heroes. In contrast, the “King is alive” rumors ridiculed Elvis 
and insulted his fans because of the claims that he was seen eating at the 
local fast-food restaurant or living in a trailer park — places working-class 
Southerners might be seen at.
The bitter words of Albert Goldman
In 1981, biographer Albert Goldman published 
one of the first books about Elvis not penned by 
a former associate, family member, or showbiz 
acquaintance. Because of his distance from the 
star, the book received more attention than pre-
vious Presley books, and it was treated like an 
important biography. Titled Elvis, the book 
remains the most notorious account of Elvis’s 
life, because Goldman openly disliked Presley 
and his music. Goldman speculated that Elvis 
had an unhealthy attachment to his mother as 
well as to his friends, the Memphis Mafia. He 
painted certain aspects of Elvis’s lifestyle as 
bizarre, including his eating habits, his prefer-
ence for young women, and his love of firearms. 
Goldman’s view of Southern culture was 
particularly prejudiced, invalidating his opinions 
of Elvis’s music.
Goldman’s book was excerpted in Rolling Stone, 
which gave it further exposure during the period 
in which Geraldo Rivera and ABC were trying to 
get access to Elvis’s autopsy. Sadly, Goldman’s 
mean-spirited biography picked up where the 
“bodyguard book” (Elvis: What Happened?) 
left off in terms of setting the tone for media 
coverage of Elvis Presley.
Eventually, the book was dismissed by music 
historians and other Elvis biographers because 
Goldman was so clearly prejudiced against the 
singer and his Southern heritage. Unfortunately, 
inaccuracies and misinformation from the book 
are still repeated, particularly on the Internet. 
Goldman’s book helped tarnish the perception 
of Elvis by the general public.

266
Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
 
The timing of these rumors couldn’t have been worse, because the story hit 
around the tenth anniversary of Elvis’s death. After years of negative stories 
about drug use and self-destructive behavior, serious discussions of his music 
and career were beginning to surface on a wide scale. But this reassessment 
was cut short because the media jumped on the “Elvis is alive” story.
Rumors about Elvis’s faked death began to stir as early as 1979 when Gail 
Brewer-Giorgio published a fictional novel titled Orion, in which a Presley-like 
entertainer arranged his own death in order to find peace of mind. Similarly, 
in 1981, a book by Steven C. Chanzes claimed that an Elvis impersonator was 
interred behind Graceland — not the real King. Both books flopped.
The rumors were put to rest for a time, but in 1987, the stories circulated 
once again. This time they were fueled by Brewer-Giorgio’s self-published 
book about the singer’s faked death titled The Most Incredible Elvis Presley 
Story Ever Told and a song by Texas record producer Major Bill Smith called 
“Hey, Big E.” Brewer-Giorgio took the premise of her fictional novel and tried 
to pass it off as the truth about Elvis’s “death.” The rumors of his faked death 
escalated in 1988 with supposed sightings of Elvis in fast-food restaurants, at 
cheap motels, and even at Chernobyl shortly after the nuclear disaster.
A legitimate publisher quickly republished Brewer-Giorgio’s book and retitled 
it Is Elvis Alive? to take advantage of the media attention. As “proof” of 
Brewer-Giorgio’s incredible claim that Elvis is alive, the publisher included an 
audiocassette of Elvis’s voice with each book. The tape featured a voice that 
sounded like Elvis discussing events that occurred after 1977.
After Brewer-Giorgio released her book and audiocassette in 1988, Geraldo 
Rivera once again stepped into an Elvis controversy to uncover the “real” 
story. (See the earlier section “Revealing the ugly truth: Elvis’s drug abuse” 
for details on how Geraldo stepped into another Elvis controversy.) Rivera 
exposed the author’s tape as a phony on his television talk show by bringing 
on an Elvis sound-alike, who revealed that he had made the recording for a 
project that never materialized. The impersonator didn’t know how the tape 
fell into Brewer-Giorgio’s hands.
Ultimately, the authenticity of the tape and the accuracy of Brewer-Giorgio’s 
theories mattered very little, because the story took on a life of its own. The 
media maintained the story as a lighthearted feature long after fans had 
become fed up with being accused of believing the story. Fans didn’t believe 
it any more than most Americans did, but the press insisted that they did. 
Nothing painted the Elvis fan as a fringe element more than the “Elvis is 
alive” story.

267
 Chapter 17: Examining the Jokes, Stereotypes, and Negative Influences
 
The rumor that Elvis was still alive spawned years of jokes and tabloid tales at 
the expense of fans, but it also had a somewhat positive effect on Elvis’s 
image. It inspired short stories by creative writers and original movies by 
clever filmmakers. (See Chapter 24 for more on Elvis-related films.) The treat-
ment of fans aside, the rumor suggested that in a way, the American public 
wanted to keep Elvis alive. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the historical figure who 
was being resurrected; instead it was Elvis, the icon of popular culture, who 
was being restored. In a backhanded way, the “Elvis is alive” rumor helped 
refigure Presley into an American folk hero endowed with cultural signifi-
cance. (See Chapter 18 for more information about this phenomenon.) That 
said, 20 years of “Is Elvis alive?” jokes are enough.
Treating Elvis with respect: It’s about time
During the 1990s, time created a distance from the white-hot nature of the 
Presley scandals. Respected authors were finally weighing in on his music 
and career as much as on his personal life. Major anniversaries of his death, 
such as the 25th, inspired serious assessments of his cultural impact, and 
well-produced releases of his music introduced Elvis to new generations 
without all the hype surrounding them. (See Chapter 18 for more information 
on Elvis’s post-death albums.) This newfound assessment of the singer 
countered some of the mainstream media’s tendency to resist giving Elvis 
his due by focusing on the negative and the ridiculous. Unfortunately, that 
attitude still hasn’t entirely disappeared.
Marketing Elvis Presley: Would You 
Like to Buy Some Elvis Sweat?
The fans aren’t alone in remembering the anniversary of Elvis’s death. Each 
year, merchandisers, promoters, collectors, and manufacturers who market 
and sell memorabilia mark the passing of another year. Significant dates, 
such as the 25th anniversary of Elvis’s death or his 50th birthday, increase 
the amount of merchandise that goes on sale.
The diversity of this merchandise is overwhelming and often amusing. From 
coats, underwear, liquor decanters, and shot glasses to lamps, clocks, wine, 
and shampoo, it’s difficult to come up with something that hasn’t featured 
Elvis’s face . . . or pelvis! Even dirt from the grounds of Graceland and sweat 
supposedly from his body have been sold to willing consumers. This section 
offers a brief overview of the merchandizing of the King.

268
Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
 
The King’s things may be fun to consider, but in the past the enormous variety 
and incredible tackiness of some of the items have brought attention and 
ridicule to Elvis’s name, further detracting from his music and accomplish-
ments. Remember, the merchandise — no matter how ridiculous — has no 
bearing on Elvis’s talent and cultural importance.
Recognizing the Colonel’s hand
The merchandizing of Elvis Presley goes as far back as 1956 when Colonel 
Parker entered into a deal with manufacturer Henry G. (Hank) Saperstein for 
the rights to manufacture several products with the singer’s image on them. 
(You can read more about this deal in Chapter 5.)
The Colonel believed himself to be an expert at promotion, including 
merchandizing. Part of his arrangement with Elvis and any other business 
partners required him to be in charge of promotions and merchandise 
(which he called “exploitations”).
During the 1950s, while “his boy” was tearing down the house in whatever 
venue he was playing, the Colonel could be found in the lobby selling photos 
of Elvis for a dime. During Elvis’s film career, the Colonel was notorious 
for making quick deals with manufacturers of cheap novelties, who would 
slap the title of Elvis’s latest film on any toy, gadget, or knickknack. The 
Colonel gave these trinkets to fan club presidents and members as promo-
tions, but to Parker, nothing was free. In exchange, fan clubs were primed to 
attend Elvis’s movies, generally more than once. Even in the 1970s, Parker 
paraded through the casino and lobby of the Hilton wearing a long duster 
emblazoned with Elvis’s name as he sold photos, souvenir menus, and other 
small-priced items.
After Elvis died, Parker continued to manage the star’s business. Legend has 
it that minutes after he heard about Elvis’s death, he muttered, “Nothing 
has changed. This won’t change anything.” Whether he said it or not, by the 
time his client was laid to rest, the Colonel, a true businessman, had already 
made a deal with Factors, Inc., to market Elvis products. Parker got Vernon’s 
signature to seal the deal on the day Elvis was buried.
In 1980, the executors of Elvis’s estate, including Priscilla Presley (Vernon 
had died in 1979), petitioned the Tennessee court for approval of all 
the financial transactions made with Parker on behalf of the Estate. The 
executors wanted to establish a trust fund and make other long-term financial 
changes. In order to establish the fund, the Estate had to detail all the 
deals related to Elvis and the Estate, including those made with Parker. A 

269
 Chapter 17: Examining the Jokes, Stereotypes, and Negative Influences
court-appointed attorney, Blanchard E. Tual, investigated Parker’s manage-
ment of Elvis from the beginning of the singer’s career to Parker’s final deal 
with Factors, Inc. This inquiry resulted in a court case charging Parker with 
“enriching himself by mismanaging Presley’s career.”
 
The Colonel hadn’t always mismanaged Elvis, but deals inked during the 
singer’s final few years, in which he was affected by drugs, were definitely 
maneuvered to the Colonel’s benefit at Elvis’s expense. One such deal was 
made in 1976 when the Colonel arranged to take 50 percent of Elvis’s income 
for managing his career, rather than his usual 15 percent. The standard 
percentage for a manager or an agent at the time was 10 percent. How the 
Colonel persuaded Elvis to go along with this deal is not known.
The judge ordered the Estate to stop all dealings with the Colonel and to sue 
him to recover at least part of the money the Colonel was responsible for 
losing. In 1983, the Estate attempted to sue Parker, who sought dismissal on 
the grounds that he wasn’t an American citizen and couldn’t be sued. For the 
first time, the Colonel admitted that he was Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk from 
Holland, not an American citizen. (See Chapter 4 for more details on the 
antics of Colonel Tom Parker.) The case was eventually settled out of court, 
and in 1984, Elvis Presley Enterprises (also known as the Estate) was granted 
the full rights to Elvis Presley’s name and likeness. All rights and royalties 
went to the Estate.
Valuing the Elvis merchandise: 
From trash to treasure
In the days after Elvis died, fans not only purchased products and souvenirs 
from manufacturers, but they also bartered and sold anything and everything 
that was connected to Elvis, including his broken guitar strings and clumps 
of grass from the lawn in front of the mausoleum where he was originally 
entombed. (See Chapter 16 for the complete story on Elvis’s original burial 
and subsequent move to Meditation Garden.)
The media is often critical of Elvis memorabilia and merchandise, and 
generally focus their comments on the most ridiculous items, suggesting 
that everything related to Elvis is in bad taste. Fans take a different view, 
however; to them, memorabilia is a way to connect with each other or to the 
Elvis era that produced their favorite souvenirs. Many fans have become 
major collectors, parlaying their hobby into a moneymaking venture. Today, 
some memorabilia, including the last concert song list Elvis ever wrote or the 
jewelry he threw into the audience during his performances, is worth thou-
sands of dollars. Rare, one-of-a-kind memorabilia is sold through the famous 
auction house, Sotheby’s. The Colonel would approve!

270
Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
 
One of the most meaningful pieces of memorabilia for Elvis fans were the 
unused concert tickets for the tour the singer was about to start when he died. 
Promoters offered refunds for ticket buyers, but many chose not to return 
their tickets. Fans’ reluctance to give up their one-of-a-kind souvenirs caused 
problems for promoters who had to account for their losses, pay cancellation 
fees, and so on. Of the $1,300,000 in tickets sold, an estimated $600,000 worth 
were kept by fans.
Reading the Memoirs: Elvis, 
We Hardly Knew Ya
Elvis left behind no autobiography or definitive interview. If anything, inter-
views and press conferences were designed to conceal information rather 
than reveal it. So, for the first couple decades after his death, the only 
windows into his personal life were the biased remembrances of former 
associates, family members, and friends who published their memoirs about 
their relationship with the King. The almost continuous release of these 
types of biographies, in which the reader learned more about the writer than 
the subject, kept Elvis’s name in the news. In the beginning, these books fell 
into two camps: those that supported the sordid stories of bizarre behavior 
and drug abuse and those that disputed them. However, the books’ lack of 
information on Elvis’s role in popular music and their highly personal nature 
fueled rumors of his drug abuse even while denying them.
Despite Elvis’s enormous fame and following, very few biographies by profes-
sional writers were published about Presley until the 1990s. The exceptions 
were two separate books titled Elvis, which were released around 1981. One 
was a scathing account of Elvis’s life written by Albert Goldman (see the 
sidebar “The bitter words of Albert Goldman” for more details), and the other 
was an assessment of his early music by rock historian Dave Marsh.
 
In lieu of reliable biographies, the bookshelves instead were dominated by 
low-budget quickies written by hacks, coffee-table picture books, novelty 
books aimed at fans, and memoirs by those who knew him. Like Elvis’s 
treatment by the media and his exploitation through merchandizing, these 
personal books seemed to stand in the way of a serious assessment of his 
music and his cultural significance. Their sensationalism and amateur 
chronicling limited the depiction of Elvis to scandal-ridden celebrity rather 
than musical pioneer or show business phenomenon.
In this section, I review the various memoirs written by former associates 
and family members. They’re valuable as chronicles of Elvis’s daily life and 
routines and as an inside view of stardom in another time, but each writer 

271
 Chapter 17: Examining the Jokes, Stereotypes, and Negative Influences
has an agenda, whether it be validation of his perspective, exploitation of his 
relationship for personal financial gain, a defense of Elvis or even the writer 
himself, and even payback. While each writer’s point of view is valid, it’s just 
that . . . point of view.
The Memphis Mafia cash in
Many former members of the Memphis Mafia published their memoirs about 
their relationships with Elvis. (You can read more about the Memphis Mafia 
in Chapter 7.) Here are some of the memoirs:
 
✓ Jerry Hopkins wrote Elvis: The Final Years (1986), and Marty and Patsy 
Lacker collaborated on Elvis: Portrait of a Friend (1979). Both memoirs 
confirmed the stories from Steve Dunleavy’s 1977 memoir Elvis: What 
Happened? about Elvis’s drug use and destructive lifestyle (see the 
earlier section “Shaping early opinions: The bodyguard book” for more 
on Dunleavy’s book).
 
✓ Lamar Fike drew the wrath of fans and former friends when he willingly 
cooperated with Albert Goldman on Elvis, which was published in 1981.
 
✓ Some members of the gang were loyal, refusing to write their own tell-
alls, but their names were thrown around in other books, so eventually 
they felt the need to get their version of events down for posterity. 
Group foreman Joe Esposito, perhaps the most diligent and professional 
of the group, published Good Rockin’ Tonight in 1994. Sonny West — one 
of the men behind the bodyguard book — took it full circle when he 
released his story Elvis: Still Taking Care of Business in 2007.
 
A cursory glance through the published memoirs of the members of the 
Memphis Mafia suggests that life with Elvis was one of perpetual adolescence. 
See Figure 17-1 to see the group posing together. The focus on fun, females, 
and freedom seemed normal for young men in their early 20s, but there was 
something irresponsible and rueful about men who pursued this credo when 
they were pushing 40. During the 1970s, when Elvis and his crew were either 
in Las Vegas or on the road, their insular lifestyle grew increasingly self-
destructive. Infighting broke out among the group, and the members’ personal 
relationships with wives and families suffered.
 
John Lennon once made an insightful statement about the ultimate destruc-
tive nature of Elvis’s ever-present entourage of friends, family members, and 
personal employees: “The King is always killed by his courtiers. He is overfed, 
overindulged, overdrunk to keep him tied to his throne. Most people in the 
position never wake up.”

The cook, the stepfamily, 
the wife, and her lover
While the title of this section spoofs the title of a well-respected film called 
The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover (1989), it nonetheless describes 
the diverse group of “authors” who threw their Elvis memoirs into the 
biography ring. The following are a few of the bios:
 
✓ One of Elvis’s cooks, Mary Jenkins, wrote a positive account of her 
employer called Elvis, Memories Beyond Graceland Gates in 1997.
 
✓ The singer’s stepmother and stepbrothers have penned several 
books about their years as Presleys, including Elvis, We Love You 
Tender (1980).
 
✓ Priscilla wrote Elvis and Me in 1985 to combat the disgruntled musings 
about her by members of the Memphis Mafia.
 
✓ Male model Michael Edwards, one of Priscilla’s boyfriends after Elvis, 
cobbled together Priscilla, Elvis and Me (1989), a long-forgotten book 
about his experiences.
 
✓ Several former employees and associates in passing, including publicist 
May Mann (Elvis: Why Won’t They Leave You Alone? 1982) and secretary 
Becky Yancy (My Life with Elvis, 1977), penned books defending Elvis 
after the drug scandals, but their marginal relationships to Presley made 
for limited perspectives. Still, their positive portraits of Elvis, whom they 
obviously admired, were an important counterpoint to the outrageous 
tales in the books by the Memphis Mafia.

273
 Chapter 17: Examining the Jokes, Stereotypes, and Negative Influences
 
✓ Among the most valuable memoirs are those by his former band mates, 
guitarist Scotty Moore and drummer D.J. Fontana, who were there 
from the beginning — actually, before the beginning — and are knowl-
edgeable about Elvis’s music. Moore’s book is titled That’s All Right, Elvis 
(1997), while Fontana has written two books, D. J. Fontana Remembers 
(1983) and The Beat Behind the King (2002).
Imitating the King: From Impersonators 
to Tribute Artists
The politically correct term for Elvis impersonators is now Elvis tribute artists, 
or ETAs, and they’re arguably the most curious offshoot of the collective 
desire to keep the singer’s name and music alive.
Many are surprised to discover that Elvis tribute artists existed long before 
his death. As far back as 1957, a fanzine article listing 25 important facts 
about Elvis Presley mentioned that he was the most impersonated enter-
tainer in the world. In 1958, Life magazine remarked on the increasing 
number of Elvis imitators in other countries, such as Germany and Japan. 
Elvis was said to have enjoyed the idea that professional Presley imper-
sonators were at work. In fact, according to some sources, he would sneak 
into nightclubs to check out the acts of some of them.
After Elvis died, the impersonator phenomenon boomed. Eventually, the 
ETAs became so removed from the looks and skills of the real Elvis Presley 
that they developed into a phenomenon unto themselves. No longer do the 
impersonators have to look or sound like Elvis. You can find female Elvis 
ETAs, including Janice K.; black Elvis ETAs, such as Clearance Giddens; Asian 
ETAs, such as Hound Dog Fujimoto; and Hispanic ETAs, of whom El Vez is the 
most original and talented.
It’s nearly impossible to accurately calculate the number of Elvis tribute 
artists around the world, but estimates range from 10,000 to 250,000.
 
Even though many in the media have taken to ridiculing the ETAs and, by 
extension, the fans who enjoy them, no fans expect the impersonators to be as 
talented or as charismatic as Elvis — or to even look exactly like him. Fans 
don’t expect impersonators to take Elvis’s place; they enjoy them as a way to 
remember and relive the excitement of one of Elvis’s live performances.

274
Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
A tribute artist’s act consists entirely of imitating Elvis’s singing and perfor-
ming style, his costumes and hairstyle, and his mannerisms and speech 
patterns. Some of the impersonators even have had plastic surgery to make 
their faces and bodies resemble the real Elvis. Most imitators choose to 
emulate the Vegas Elvis, exaggerating the look of that era with coal-black 
hair, massive sideburns, and the ever-present jumpsuit. Very few imitators 
attempt to emulate the Elvis of the 1950s or 1960s, but there have been some, 
including Trent Carlini. Many have combined their names with one part of 
Elvis’s name, such as Joe Elvis and Rick Presley.
At one point, the Estate attempted to bring legal action against the imperson-
ators for violating the copyright on Elvis’s name and image, but there were so 
many that the lawsuit was dropped. The Estate, like most Elvis fans, now 
accepts the impersonators as an indelible part of Presleyana. In fact, during 
the 30th anniversary festivities at Elvis Week in Memphis, the Estate spon-
sored the Ultimate Elvis Tribute Artist contest in the ultimate example of “If 
you can’t beat ’em, join ’em.”
 
Just after Elvis’s death, most impersonators were professional entertainers 
with singing and stage experience. Nightclubs and stage reviews hired 
performers, such as Chicago’s talented Rick Saucedo, because of their serious 
interpretation of Elvis’s talents. As the years progressed, however, more 
amateurs joined the ranks of the impersonators. Many of these amateurs hold 
day jobs and never entertain beyond the confines of their hometowns. What 
they share is a desire to perform, a love of Elvis Presley, and the ability to 
bring a smile to the faces of those with open minds and good senses of humor.

Chapter 18
Appreciating Elvis as a Cultural 
and Historical Figure
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring Elvis’s music in the post-death era
▶ Considering Elvis as a character in movies
▶ Appreciating a good biography
A
s time erased the real Elvis Presley and replaced him with the cultural 
icon, Elvis’s music was reissued in a way that showed his musical 
importance. He also continued to show up in the movies — first in made-for-
TV biographical films and later as a character in big-screen dramatic features. 
The latter films present diverse interpretations of Elvis, which make his 
image far more nuanced than it ever was before. By depicting Elvis Presley 
as a larger-than-life symbolic figure with various connotations, these films 
contributed to a reevaluation of Elvis. Between the reissuing of his music and 
the emergence of his new symbolic status, he became mythic in stature — 
too big to be taken down by old jokes or old media criticisms.
This chapter chronicles the evolution of RCA’s musical output after Elvis’s 
death and offers a summary of the mythic use of his image in recent movies. 
The music and the movie-mythmaking point to an appreciation of Elvis 
Presley as a significant cultural and historical figure — finally.
Taking Care of Elvis’s Music: BMG-RCA
Elvis’s death unleashed an outpouring of albums from RCA to take advantage 
of the sudden demand for the singer’s music. However, those in charge of his 
catalog did little to take advantage of the renewed interest in Presley and 
squandered the opportunity to position him as a significant musical figure. 
With few notable exceptions, RCA merely repackaged the same material and 
reissued old albums.

276
Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
In 1986, the Bertlesmann Music Group (BMG) absorbed RCA, and BMG 
formed an international restoration committee to research and restore 
the Presley catalog of recordings. The committee released well-planned CD 
compilations and albums in a way that fostered an appreciation for the 
significance of the singer’s music.
 
Eventually the committee’s efforts helped to shine a spotlight on Elvis’s music 
rather than on his scandalous personal life, his bulging waistline, the tacky 
merchandise, or his fans. This renewed attention to his music led to cover 
recordings by other artists, soundtrack opportunities in Hollywood films, and 
musical plays based on his music. Most of all, this attention rehabilitated 
Elvis’s reputation as an important musical influence.
Cranking out the discs: RCA puts 
the pressing plants to work
Immediately after Elvis’s death on August 16, 1977, record stores across the 
country sold out of his records. New orders for the singer’s albums began 
pouring in, so RCA’s pressing plants operated 24 hours a day to fill the 
orders. For a while, the record company even subcontracted other pressing 
plants to keep up with the demand. By September, RCA still hadn’t caught up 
with all the orders. RCA’s offices and pressing plants outside the U.S. found 
themselves in the same position. Pressing plants operated day and night. A 
factory in Hamburg, West Germany, produced only Elvis’s records in an 
attempt to meet the demands of fans in that country. By October, sales were 
so high in the U.S. that several of Elvis’s albums were on the charts again. 
This success set the tone for RCA’s approach toward its most historically 
significant artist: Release as much product as quickly as possible.
 
Over the next few years, RCA continued to release Elvis Presley albums at the 
rate of two or three per year. As was the case while the singer was alive, some 
of the albums were worthy efforts, but others were inferior. (See Chapter 15 
for more information on the decline in his recording output.) The following 
titles are a representative sampling of RCA’s handling of the Presley catalog:
 
✓ He Walks Beside Me — Favorite Songs of Faith and Inspiration (1978) 
contained previously released material simply repackaged yet again.
 
✓ Guitar Man (1980) attempted to take advantage of developments in 
sound recording and enhancement to “improve” Elvis’s sound, but any 
improvement in sound quality was debatable. However, the album 
charted well, reaching number 6 on the country lists and number 49 on 
the Top 200, indicating a noteworthy commercial success.
 
✓ Other albums seemed to be the result of RCA searching the vaults for 
any leftover tape with Elvis’s voice on it. Elvis — Greatest Hits Vol. 1 
(1981) contained never-before-released live material from Las Vegas, 
Hawaii, and Nashville.

277
 Chapter 18: Appreciating Elvis as a Cultural and Historical Figure
RCA was criticized by some purists for tinkering with the recordings of its 
most famous artist when it released several Elvis albums of older material 
that were enhanced for modern audiences. Elvis: I Was the One (1983) makes 
use of modern instruments that were overdubbed to accompany Elvis’s 
vocals. Other albums consisted of original mono recordings with rechanneled 
stereo in which techniques such as filters to separate high and low frequen-
cies are used to create the impression that the sound was recorded in stereo. 
Rock ’n’ roll historians claim that any attempt to “improve” or “clean up” 
Elvis’s early recordings doesn’t necessarily illuminate his contributions to 
popular music; instead, it can distort them.
RCA stumbled across an unexpected treasure in 1983 when a producer 
found master tapes and records stored at Graceland. Some of the tapes were 
recordings of unreleased live performances and offstage conversations with 
Elvis. In 1985, RCA released much of the musical material on a six-album set 
that celebrated Elvis’s 50th birthday.
Developing new strategies 
to release Elvis’s music
A new approach to marketing and releasing Elvis Presley’s music began after 
RCA was sold to a German publishing group called Bertlesmann Music 
Group, or BMG, in 1986. Two years later, BMG formed an international resto-
ration committee to research the Presley catalog of recordings and restore 
them to their former glory. Representatives from the United States, England, 
Germany, Denmark, and Asia comprised the committee, which was ultimately 
responsible for the high quality of the compilation and album releases from 
the late 1980s onward.
Ernst Jorgensen and Roger Semon, two of the most important members of the 
team, landed the job of listening to every minute of every tape with Elvis’s 
voice on it. Over the years, the two tirelessly reordered, cataloged, and 
researched Elvis material.
 
Jorgensen and Semon’s main contribution at BMG-RCA was to release Elvis’s 
music in boxed sets and themed albums to introduce the singer to younger 
audiences. By grouping the music chronologically or by genre, they provided 
a context with which to learn about and appreciate Presley. The two-man 
team also hired music and popular culture historians to write informational 
booklets to further explain the importance of the music. These booklets 
were inserted inside the CD cases as bonus features. Jorgensen and Semon’s 
work has gone a long way toward refocusing attention on Elvis’s musical 
triumphs rather than on the personal tragedies of his life or the wacky aspects 
of his lifestyle.

278
Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
 
In an interview with Record Collector magazine about his work, Jorgensen 
remarked, “I think my greatest challenge . . . was to get Elvis reestablished as a 
significant and important artist and not just a stupid joke in the National 
Enquirer because there was a tendency in the media to treat him like that. I 
think fifteen years later that has been achieved.”
Introducing the Masters Series to casual 
listeners and die-hard fans alike
Among the most important of the BMG-RCA productions was the Masters 
Series, which represents Jorgensen and Semon’s efforts to not only release 
Elvis Presley’s music commercially but to reframe it historically. Together, 
these three sets of CDs are a faithful audio documentation of Elvis’s music 
from the beginning to the end. The tracks have been digitally remastered 
from old Sun and RCA recordings, but they maintain the integrity of the 
originals. (You can read about Elvis’s association with Sun Records and RCA 
in Chapters 2 and 4, respectively.) Also included are the vocal exchanges and 
patter between Elvis and his musicians, which capture the camaraderie of the 
participants as well as the spontaneity of the sessions.
 
Separately, each set suggests something about Elvis’s career that defies a 
commonly held perception. Consider the following:
 
✓ By following the evolution of Elvis’s work from 1954 to 1958, Elvis: The 
King of Rock ’n’ Roll — The Complete ’50s Masters (1992) proves that 
Elvis didn’t “steal” the sound of black rhythm and blues artists and call 
it his own. Instead, the tracks reveal a blending of influences and an 
integration of musical genres that coalesced into a commercial sound 
and inched closer and closer toward a universal, mainstream style.
 
✓ Elvis: From Nashville to Memphis — The Complete ’60s Masters (1993) 
shows that Elvis didn’t entirely abandon his roots in country, gospel, 
and rhythm and blues after he achieved his pop style — an accusation 
hurled most often by rock-music critics. The smooth, mainstream pop 
stylings of Elvis’s movie soundtracks did dominate this period, but his 
recordings of blues tunes — “Reconsider Baby” and “Such a Night” — 
and his gospel work later in the decade are declarations of his Southern 
heritage.
 
✓ Elvis: Walk a Mile in My Shoes — The Complete ’70s Masters (1995) 
reveals that Elvis didn’t grow lazy and rest on his laurels after his come-
back to stage performances. He was a workhorse in the studio until his 
lifestyle caught up with him in the mid-1970s. (Chapter 15 discusses the 
effects of Elvis’s lifestyle on his decline.)
An archival achievement as well as a musical one, the Masters Series also 
includes complete session credits and lengthy liner notes by music 
historians Peter Guralnik and Dave Marsh.

279
 Chapter 18: Appreciating Elvis as a Cultural and Historical Figure
 
You can find a more concise treatment of Elvis’s career in Elvis Presley 
Platinum: A Life in Music (1997), which charts the evolution of his style in a 
four-CD box set. Platinum contains 100 tracks, 77 of which were previously 
unreleased. The unreleased material represents mostly alternate takes of 
Presley classics or practice runs of various songs. However, it also includes the 
newly discovered 1954 demo of Elvis singing “I’ll Never Stand in Your Way.”
The chronological treatment of the music used in the Masters Series compels 
listeners to reevaluate the familiar and find a context for the unreleased 
material. In doing so, a new light is shined on Elvis’s music, giving listeners a 
full appreciation for the impact of his career. This newfound appreciation 
rings true not only for young audiences, rock ’n’ roll listeners, and Presley 
critics but also for Elvis fans, who remained faithful through the dark years of 
badly packaged rereleases.
Digging for gold
To further shine light on Elvis’s musical significance, the BMG committee 
researched the actual sales figures for the records and albums that Presley 
sold early in his career.
The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) is the official organiza-
tion to which record companies report sales and request gold and platinum 
records for their artists. However, the RIAA wasn’t formed until 1958, and 
Elvis had already sold millions of records by then. Even though RCA awarded 
Elvis various in-house gold records for his pre-1958 hits, they never asked 
the RIAA for retroactive certification of these records. Also, RCA rarely 
requested additional certification when Elvis’s records went gold or platinum 
more than once. So the BMG committee used Colonel Tom Parker’s extensive 
files to accurately research just how many records Elvis sold and which ones 
deserved gold, platinum, or multi-platinum status. (To read more about 
Parker, Elvis’s long-time manager, refer to Chapter 4.)
After completing its research, the committee estimated that Elvis has sold 
more than a billion records worldwide. By August of 1992, the committee had 
updated the status of Elvis’s albums and singles. As a result, he was awarded 
110 gold, platinum, and multi-platinum albums and singles by the RIAA — the 
largest presentation of gold and platinum records in history.
As of 2005, the last date that BMG asked for a total accounting for all Presley 
releases, Elvis has earned 150 gold, platinum, or multi-platinum albums, 
singles, or extended-play albums (EPs). The RIAA first grants a hot-selling 
recording a gold disc when it meets the appropriate number of sales, and 
then a platinum disc, and then a multi-platinum disc. If Elvis had been 
receiving the RIAA certifications in the proper sequence all along instead of 
the all-in-one accounting in 1992, he would probably have around 270 gold, 
platinum, or multi-platinum albums.

280
Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
Marketing ELVIS: 30 #1 Hits
In 2002, to commemorate Elvis on the 25th anniversary of his death, RCA 
released a compilation of his number-one records titled ELV1S: 30 #1 Hits. 
The marketing campaign was designed around the tag line, “Before anyone 
did anything, Elvis did everything.” A brilliant bit of phrasing, this line 
succinctly summarized Elvis’s contribution to pop culture history while 
evoking the dynamism of his sound and the danger of his original image.
The world needed to be reminded of all of this — and it was. ELV1S: 30 #1 Hits 
debuted on the charts in the number-one position, meaning that it sold 
500,000 copies in the first week of release. Debuting an album in the top spot 
on the U.S. charts was an accomplishment that Elvis hadn’t managed while 
he was alive. In addition to the United States, ELV1S: 30 #1 Hits opened at 
number one in 16 other countries, including Canada, France, the United 
Kingdom, Argentina, and the United Arab Emirates. Marketing strategy aside, 
it was the music that accounted for the CD’s success.
Arranged in chronological order, the compilation of hits covered Elvis’s 
entire career at RCA — from “Heartbreak Hotel” in 1956 to “Way Down” in 
1977. All the songs in the compilation reached number one on the charts 
either in the United States or the United Kingdom.
 
As a last-minute addition to ELV1S: 30 #1 Hits, the producers included a remix 
of “A Little Less Conversation,” a song originally part of the soundtrack for the 
film Live a Little, Love a Little. (See Chapter 9 for more information on this film, 
which was released in 1968.) The Dutch deejay act Junkie XL reworked the 
song in early 2002 for a Nike World Cup commercial, but when it was released 
as a dance-mix single, it became Elvis’s first top-ten single in decades. “A Little 
Less Conversation” was billed as a bonus track and was separate in concept 
from the rest of the cuts on the CD.
Jorgensen and Semon compiled and researched the tracks on ELV1S: 30 #1 
Hits. BMG-RCA hired a group of expert engineers and mixers to optimize 
the sound in ways that remained true to the original recordings. This assign-
ment proved to be difficult considering the condition of the original tapes. 
Stashed away at RCA’s storage facilities in Iron Mountain, Pennsylvania, some 
of the original tapes hadn’t been played in more than 40 years. Most were 
deteriorated to some degree, and the first goal was to transfer them onto a 
digital format for remixing or remastering. Some tapes, including the tape for 
“Way Down,” were in such bad condition that they were baked in an oven to 
prevent the oxide from falling off the tape.
Elvis’s songs from 1956 to 1961 had been recorded on a mono system and 
couldn’t be remixed, only remastered. Those from 1961 to 1966 had been 
recorded on a three-track recording system and required an antique three-
track machine to help in the remixing process. Only a few of these machines 

281
 Chapter 18: Appreciating Elvis as a Cultural and Historical Figure
still exist, and the one the remixing team used tended to overheat, further 
aggravating the process. Later tunes had been recorded on 8 tracks, 16 
tracks, and even 24 tracks and were considerably easier to remix. However, 
the goal was to produce a uniform quality to all the tracks and ensure that 
the quality remained whether the CD was played on a home stereo, on a 
computer, or in a car stereo. The efforts of these engineers and remixers 
resulted in a modernization that doesn’t detract from Elvis’s renditions of 
these songs. Instead this modernization restores the songs’ vitality.
The vitality in Elvis’s recordings comes in part from the way he worked in the 
studio. Consider the following:
 
✓ When Elvis entered the studio, he took down the partitions between 
performer and musician so he was in the same room as his band.
 
✓ Elvis sang each take of a song completely through as though it were a 
performance before an audience. Each take was enlivened — or, in some 
cases, ruined — by interaction between Elvis and the band in a kind of 
trial-and-error approach.
 
✓ All decisions regarding a song were made in the studio during the 
session — not beforehand. He generally didn’t overdub, nor did he 
splice together various takes of a song to get a perfect “studio version.”
The expert remixing and remastering of the songs on ELV1S: 30 #1 Hits 
captures the spontaneity of Elvis’s unique approach to recording — one he 
never abandoned for easier, more technically driven methods. (See Chapters 
4 and 11 for more information on Elvis’s approach to recording.)
In 2004, BMG merged with Sony Music Entertainment to become Sony BMG. 
The company continues to use the RCA Record label for issuing Elvis 
releases, and Jorgensen and Semon still work with Sony BMG on showcasing 
the Presley catalog. In 2005, Sony BMG started a special Elvis collector’s 
label called Follow That Dream Records, which releases special collector’s 
material and reissues classic Elvis albums that are no longer part of the 
mainstream Sony BMG (RCA) catalog.
Mythologizing Elvis Onscreen
Hollywood loomed large at every turn in Elvis’s career. He turned to the 
movies in the 1950s in order to deflect negative publicity from his image as a 
notorious rock ’n’ roller, and then he turned to an acting career in 1960 to 
increase his appeal to the mainstream audience. (See Part II for the complete 
story of Elvis’s film career.) During the 1970s, two well-received documenta-
ries showcased Elvis’s concert act to millions who might not otherwise see 
the singer live. (Refer to Chapter 14 for information on these documentaries.)

Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
After his death, documentaries and television miniseries and biographies 
explored different facets of his life, from his personal relationships to his 
career high points. By the end of the 1980s, a different cinematic depiction of 
the King of Rock ’n’ Roll emerged. In this depiction, the figure of Elvis was 
used for its iconographic power to convey a variety of themes or ideas, 
turning him into a kind of a folk hero. This section offers a rundown of Elvis’s 
post-death “career” onscreen.
Busting the biopics
Elvis’s last movie as a star opened in 1969, and his bitter remarks about his 
acting career at that time made it clear that he was through with Hollywood. 
But, Hollywood wasn’t through with Elvis.
Beginning in 1979, a spate of miniseries and made-for-television biographies 
began rolling out, all claiming to offer a true slice of Elvis’s real life. They 
range in quality from the thoughtful Elvis (1979), directed by the talented 
John Carpenter, to the ridiculous Elvis and the Beauty Queen (1981), featuring 
Miami Vice’s Don Johnson hopelessly miscast as the King. With the exception 
of Carpenter’s biography and the ABC-TV series Elvis, produced in 1990, most 
of these efforts are neither dramatic nor well crafted. Yet, they share in 
common an attempt to reach beyond Elvis’s life story in order to capture 
what made him tick.
Appreciating the first biopic
On February 11, 1979, ABC-TV aired Elvis, the first biographical picture, 
or biopic, about the singer’s life. Well crafted and sincere, this made-for-
television feature was directed by John Carpenter, a respected filmmaker 
best known for his horror films (Halloween and Escape from New York, for 
example). It was produced by Dick Clark, a high-profile supporter of rock ’n’ 
Kurt Russell’s many connections to Elvis
Actor Kurt Russell has experienced more than 
one brush with Elvis Presley during his career. 
The most distinguished example was his 
acclaimed performance in the TV biopic Elvis 
(see “Appreciating the first biopic” for details), 
but his career connection actually goes back to 
his childhood. In It Happened at the World’s Fair 
(1963), 10-year-old Kurt had a walk-on as a 
bratty boy who kicks Elvis in the shins — a 
moment captured forever in a famous film still. 
In 1994, Russell also supplied the voice for the 
character Elvis Presley in Forrest Gump. 
Onscreen, Peter Dobson appeared as the young 
Presley, but it was Russell’s voice that viewers 
heard. In 2001, Russell and Kevin Costner co-
starred as a pair of Elvis impersonators who are 
also thieves in the violent R-rated film 3000 
Miles to Graceland.

283
 Chapter 18: Appreciating Elvis as a Cultural and Historical Figure
roll music since his show American Bandstand hit the airwaves in 1956. Airing 
18 months after Presley’s death, the biopic starred Kurt Russell, who offered 
a complex, sympathetic portrayal of Elvis during a time when controversy, 
scandal, and rumor were swirling around his drug use and excessive lifestyle. 
Russell received a much-deserved Emmy nomination for his portrayal of the 
King. (Check out the nearby sidebar, which explains Russell’s other brushes 
with Elvis.)
Dismissing the other biopics
The continued popularity of Elvis Presley among his fans spawned a 
number of TV biopics over the next 30 years, none of which surpassed John 
Carpenter’s Elvis (which I explain in the preceding section). Most of the 
shows starred actors who were unsuited to the role; they tended to mimic 
Elvis’s mannerisms and voice in lieu of depicting him as a three-dimensional 
character. Save yourself the disappointment of watching any of the following:
 
✓ Elvis and the Beauty Queen (1981), a syrupy account of the relationship 
between Elvis and Linda Thompson, his long-term girlfriend after 
Priscilla. This biopic suffered from the miscasting of Don Johnson, 
whose raspy tenor voice was the opposite of Elvis’s deep, low tones.
 
✓ Elvis and Me (1988), a two-part miniseries based on Priscilla Presley’s 
autobiography of the same title, which featured Dale Midkiff as the 
King. Even though Midkiff made for a distant, uncharismatic Elvis, 32 
million viewers still watched and made it the highest-rated miniseries 
of that season.
 
✓ Elvis and the Colonel (1993), which starred the unknown Rob 
Youngblood as Elvis and Beau Bridges as Elvis’s infamous manager 
Colonel Tom Parker. The biopic shared the same title as Dirk Vellenga’s 
biography of Parker, but its fictionalized account is little more than a 
simplistic warning about the high price of fame.
 
✓ Elvis, a new biopic that was produced in 2005. The show was fully 
supported by Elvis Presley Enterprises and became the first to feature 
Elvis’s master recordings. Starring Irish actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers, the 
two-part miniseries lacked sufficient insight to be anything more than a 
conventional biopic, and Rhys Meyers who knew little about Elvis, 
lacked any understanding of the American icon he was portraying.
Remembering the best interpretation of the King’s life and career
In the spring of 1990, ABC-TV launched Elvis, a television series based on the 
very beginning of Presley’s career, from 1954–1955, before he became a 
national sensation. During this period, Elvis was a naive young truck driver 
hoping to begin a career as a singer. (Flip to Chapter 2 to read more about 
Elvis’s early years.) The series, which was coproduced by Priscilla Presley 
and ex-Memphis Mafia member Jerry Schilling, was short lived, but it offered 
the public a thought-provoking interpretation of Elvis’s life.

284
Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
Starring Michael St. Gerard, the series was based on actual events in Elvis’s 
life, but each experience was shaped so the episode pointed to a deeper 
significance. Some episodes were allegories that foretold Elvis’s eventual 
impact on popular music and his legendary status as the King of Rock ’n’ Roll; 
others commented on the effect that his childhood had on the rest of his life.
 
Shot on location, with stellar production values and a talented cast, Elvis the 
series remains the best interpretation of Presley’s life and career because it 
reached beyond mere biography to express key themes and important ideas.
Discovering the documentary: This Is Elvis
Produced, directed, and written by Andrew Solt and Malcolm Leo, the docu-
mentary This Is Elvis released in theaters in 1981. The film both re-creates 
scenes and combines news footage, television performances, and still 
photography to tell the story of Elvis’s life and career. Informative, engaging, 
and fair, This Is Elvis offers a sensitive overview of the singer’s life and career 
in a flashback structure, without suffering from the bad casting and sordid 
melodrama of the biopics.
The film opens with the shocking news of the singer’s death and then flashes 
back to his childhood years in Tupelo, Mississippi. Four different actors 
portray Elvis at various points in his life, including his childhood, teen years 
when he performs in front of his high-school class for a talent show, his 
mature years when he’s hospitalized for numerous ailments, and on the eve 
of his death at Graceland. Other events and phases of his career are depicted 
through news footage, home movies, concert material, and still photography. 
This Is Elvis was one of the first serious examinations of Elvis’s life, and it 
holds up remarkably well today.
Documentaries are rarely released theatrically, but like the concert documen-
taries Elvis — That’s the Way It Is (1970) and Elvis on Tour (1972), This Is 
Elvis became a box-office success. See Chapter 14 for a look at the concert 
documentaries.
Turning Elvis into a symbol 
in fictional films
During the late 1980s, narrative films in which Elvis is a character — and not 
the subject of a biopic — began to emerge. Some were biographies based on 
other historical figures; some were complete fiction, often with outrageous 
story lines. All of them focused on the potent power of Elvis as an image to 
evoke ideas and move their audiences emotionally.

285
 Chapter 18: Appreciating Elvis as a Cultural and Historical Figure
 
No longer just a performer or a famous figure, Elvis Presley, the King of Rock 
’n’ Roll, now embodies a range of ideals, concepts, and values — from Elvis 
the great integrator of our society in Hearts of Dixie (1989) to Elvis the gaudy 
Vegas performer, who represents the excess and corruption of modern 
America, in 3000 Miles to Graceland (2001). Though contradictory in meaning, 
both uses of Elvis as a symbol are valid in context of the films. These extremes 
suggest the diversity of Elvis representations in various fictional movies.
The following sections show a selection of some of the most interesting uses 
of Elvis’s image in feature films. Some of the films are very good, some have 
good critical reputations, and some are flawed but worth a look. All provoke 
thought about Elvis as a cultural icon.
Heartbreak Hotel: Elvis to the rescue
One of the first fiction films to prominently feature Elvis Presley as a charac-
ter, the comedy Heartbreak Hotel (1988) involves a teenage boy in 1972 who 
kidnaps Elvis and brings him home to his single mother in a small Ohio 
town. The family has its share of problems. For one, they live in a ramshackle 
boarding house that has fallen into disrepair, which seems to reflect the 
disorder of their lives. Also, the members each have some issues of their 
own: The mother is depressed, lonely, and always falls for the wrong men; 
the son lacks self-confidence; and the daughter is afraid of the monsters that 
lurk in the dark.
Like a bona fide movie hero, Elvis “rescues” the family from its problems. As 
he repairs the fixtures on the house, mows the lawn, and even redecorates, 
he restores order within the family, fixing broken hearts and mending egos. 
At the same time, Elvis finds happiness in performing these everyday tasks 
and chores — something he never gets to do as the King of Rock ’n’ Roll. The 
character of Elvis represents all of their fantasies come true, only to show 
them the beauty of their family and everyday lives.
 
Tuesday Weld co-starred as the mother in Heartbreak Hotel. Weld was also 
Elvis’s real-life costar in Wild in the Country (1961).
Heart of Dixie: Elvis and race relations
Released a year after Heartbreak Hotel, in 1989, Heart of Dixie dramatizes 
racial issues in Mississippi during the mid-1950s. An Elvis Presley concert is 
used to illustrate the state of race relations at the time. Elvis’s remarkable 
but volatile music — a combination of white country western and black 
rhythm and blues — signifies integration. In the film, his concert draws both 
blacks and whites. Tension over this union of cultures erupts into violence at 
the concert when white audience members brutally attack a black couple 
who are dancing. The situation prefigures the tension that will surface over 
the announcement about the integration of the University of Mississippi.

286
Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
Mystery Train: Elvis in spirit
Mystery Train (1989), a unique film directed by independent filmmaker Jim 
Jarmusch, tells three seemingly unrelated stories. Here’s a breakdown of the 
story lines:
 
✓ In the first story, a young Japanese couple hooked on American pop 
culture pass through Memphis as part of their vacation.
 
✓ The second story offers a look at an Italian widow on a layover who 
spends the night in a run-down Memphis hotel as she waits for the body 
of her dead husband to be sent home.
 
✓ In the third story, a trio of hapless thieves hole up in the same hotel 
while on the lam.
At the end of the film, the viewer discovers that the three stories are 
happening simultaneously, though the characters have little connection 
to one another. They remain isolated at the end of their experiences as 
victims of the dislocation and alienation that pervade the film.
The title, which is derived from one of Elvis’s Sun recordings, and the 
Memphis setting cause the viewer to expect a film about Elvis Presley. Yet, 
Elvis, Graceland, and a recognizable Memphis are noticeably absent. Instead, 
tacky portraits of Elvis grace the rooms of the cheap, run-down Arcade Hotel 
where most of the action takes place; the hotel employees talk about Elvis 
trivia; guests admire their T-shirts from Graceland; “Blue Moon” plays on the 
radio in the background; and the confused ghost of Elvis appears briefly in 
one scene.
Like the characters in the film, the viewer experiences Elvis only as an icon of 
American pop culture. And also like the characters, today’s fans buy souve-
nirs, listen to his oldies on the radio, and circulate mythic stories about his 
life; but, of course, these are poor substitutes for the authentic experience. 
To Jarmusch, Elvis has become an icon of a commercialized pop culture 
that’s served up as a substitute for experience, compounding the isolation 
and alienation of modern society.
3000 Miles to Graceland: Violent Vegas impersonators
In 3000 Miles to Graceland (2001), five impersonators try to rob a Vegas 
casino, but plans go awry when the head of the gang betrays his companions. 
In this film, Las Vegas is a dark, gritty town, and the seedy-looking imperson-
ators with their extra-long sideburns and ultra-tacky jumpsuits are more 
than excessive; they’re decadent and vulgar. In dressing the thieves like 
grubby impersonators, who are faux representations of a unique, authentic 
entertainer who changed the social history of our country, the director 
suggests that a corruption of sorts has infested America. 3000 Miles to 
Graceland is rich in thought-provoking imagery, but its poor craftsmanship, 
nonstop profanity, and excessive violence distract from the film’s strengths.

287
 Chapter 18: Appreciating Elvis as a Cultural and Historical Figure
Forrest Gump: Getting it wrong
Not all representations of Elvis Presley as a character in a fictional film 
successfully depict who he was. Some use him in such a superficial way that 
the character is wasted or amounts to little more than a weak joke. The Elvis 
character in Forrest Gump (1994) is the perfect example of getting it wrong, 
resulting in a complete waste of the singer’s image.
Forrest Gump tells the story of a simpleton’s epic journey through life in 
the latter half of the 20th century. Along the way, he encounters real-life 
historical figures and participates in actual historical events. The film’s 
special effects team, headed by Ken Ralston, won an Oscar for the computer-
generated imagery (CGI) that made it possible for Tom Hanks as Forrest 
Gump to interact with real historical figures in documentary news footage.
One of Forrest’s earliest encounters in the film is with a young Elvis Presley 
in the mid-1950s; however, Elvis isn’t re-created with CGI. Instead, he’s 
played by actor Peter Dobson and voiced by Kurt Russell. It seems Elvis is a 
struggling singer staying at Gump’s boarding house and hasn’t yet stumbled 
onto his signature performing style. As a child, Forrest wears leg braces 
because of a spinal condition, so he walks and moves in an awkward, jerky 
gait as an adult. So when Elvis plays guitar and sings for him, Forrest begins 
to dance with herky-jerky movements. Inspired by Forrest, Elvis works these 
movements into his act, and the rest is history.
 
The idea that the most famous entertainer of the 20th century “borrowed” 
his unique performing style from such humble origins is quaint at best, but 
ultimately it robs Elvis’s style of its sexual undertones and of its cultural 
significance as a fusion of black and white roots music — two factors that 
changed the course of popular music.
Showing up in biopics of other celebrities
Biographical interpretations, or biopics, of real-life entertainers are a popular 
genre. So it isn’t surprising that Elvis’s peers at Sun Studio were given the 
Hollywood treatment just like Presley. Given that they all recorded for the 
The King takes the stage
At least two musical plays have been written 
about Elvis’s early music: All Shook Up (2005) 
and Million Dollar Quartet (2008). All Shook Up 
is a fantasy set in 1955 in which a cool, young 
drifter blows into a Midwestern town and sets 
hearts afire despite the town ordinances 
against anything fun. Million Dollar Quartet is a 
re-creation of the legendary afternoon that 
Johnny Cash, Elvis, Carl Perkins, and Jerry Lee 
Lewis jammed at Sun Studio. (Check out Chapter 
19 for more details on this infamous story.)

288
Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
same small studio, it’s fitting that Elvis shows up in the biopics of these 
colleagues. In each of these films, Elvis is treated as a symbol of something 
rather than as a real-life historical figure.
Great Balls of Fire: Goodness gracious, it’s Jerry Lee Lewis
Great Balls of Fire (1989) was an interpretive biopic of Jerry Lee Lewis, a 
rockabilly singer who, like Elvis, had started with Sun Records in Memphis. In 
the film, Lewis is presented as the rock ’n’ roller destined to follow in the 
footsteps of Elvis Presley, who’s used as a symbol of the highest level of 
fame and fortune. Lewis’s closeness to that goal is indicated in two scenes 
involving Elvis. As Lewis’s star is rising, Elvis is shown in a brief scene alone 
and jealous of the immense fan adulation enjoyed by his new rockabilly rival. 
Later, just as Lewis is about to reach the pinnacle of success, Elvis is drafted 
into the army. He finds Lewis alone in Sun Studio and bitterly tells him, 
“Take it, take it all.” Unfortunately, Lewis’s sense of individuality and his 
freewheeling antics, which he refuses to curb, are scandalous to the main-
stream public and prevent him from achieving Elvis’s level of fame and 
fortune.
 
Michael St. Gerard, who plays Presley in Elvis, the TV series (see the earlier 
section “Remembering the best interpretation of the King’s life and career” 
for details), portrays a brooding, sullen Elvis in Great Balls of Fire. St. Gerard 
also plays Elvis in the 1989 fictional film Heart of Dixie. Of all the actors who 
portrayed the young Elvis, Gerard looked the most like him and did a credible 
working-class Southern accent.
Walk the Line: Johnny, Jerry, and Elvis
In 2005, a biopic of Johnny Cash — Sun Records’s other legendary son — 
enjoyed critical acclaim and popular success. The biopic titled Walk the Line 
focuses mostly on Cash’s romance with country singer June Carter. The first 
part of the film captures the earliest days of rockabilly, when Cash, Elvis, and 
Jerry Lee Lewis packed themselves into beat-up cars and drove from gig to 
gig, where they played to screaming girls in sold-out auditoriums and halls.
Star Joaquin Phoenix plays Cash, while newcomers Tyler Hilton and Waylon 
Payne play Presley and Lewis, respectively. Payne portrays Lewis as an out-
of-control prankster who thinks of himself as a God-fearing Christian, an exag-
geration of Lewis’s persona. A walking contradiction, he likes to blow things 
up with dynamite and then remind the group that they’re all going to hell for 
singing the Devil’s music. Elvis is depicted as the object of unbridled lust for 
most of the girls in the audience. Together, the pair symbolize the sexuality 
and uninhibited spirit of rockabilly — a new sound for a new generation. The 
inclusion of Presley and Lewis as Cash’s tour mates helps place Cash outside 
the mainstream of country music, a running theme in the film.

289
 Chapter 18: Appreciating Elvis as a Cultural and Historical Figure
 
As a side note, Walk the Line serves as a reminder of Elvis’s country roots, a 
part of his history and music too often neglected by pop-culture historians 
and critics who prefer to celebrate the rhythm and blues influence. (See 
Chapter 3 for more information on Elvis during this period.)
Reading Some Worthy Elvis Biographies
Elvis was dead almost 20 years before an objective, thoroughly researched, 
comprehensive biography was written about him. The two-volume account 
written by music historian Peter Guralnik in the mid-1990s counts as the 
definitive Elvis biography. Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley 
begins at birth and concludes with Elvis’s departure for the army; Careless 
Love: The Unmaking of Elvis picks up the saga in 1958 and follows through to 
his death. Southern music is Guralnik’s area of specialty, so he has written 
extensively about country music, blues, and rhythm and blues. His insightful 
analysis of Elvis’s music is one of the strengths of his work.
More books have been written about Elvis Presley than about any other 
entertainer. The Elvis division of the National Popular Culture Association 
estimates that more than 1,700 books have been written about America’s 
most famous performer. Of those, many have been biographies, including 
career accounts; personal memoirs by friends, associates, and former 
Other films featuring Elvis
Over the years, several films featuring Elvis as a 
character or using him as symbol have been 
released, including the following:
 ✓ Bye Bye Birdie (1963)
 ✓ Touched by Love (1980)
 ✓ Eat the Peach (1986)
 ✓ Leningrad Cowboys Go America (1989)
 ✓ Wild at Heart (1990)
 ✓ True Romance (1993)
 ✓ The Woman Who Loved Elvis (1993)
 ✓ Picasso at the Lapin Agile (1993)
 ✓ Elvis Meets Nixon (1997)
 ✓ Finding Graceland (1998)
 ✓ Bubba Ho-Tep (2002)
 ✓ Honeymoon In Vegas (2002)
 ✓ Elvis Has Left the Building (2004)
 ✓ Hounddog (2007)
You can read about some of these films in fur-
ther detail in Chapter 24.

members of the Memphis Mafia; and dubious bios by those with personal 
agendas. The best books address his meaning as a cultural icon, analyze 
the complexities of his music, or offer an objective view of his career (rather 
than dwell on his personal life or misrepresent his movies). These solid 
biographies include the following:
 
✓ Elvis Series by Bill Burk, 1990–1994
 
✓ In Search of Elvis: Music, Race, Art, Religion edited by Vernon

Visiting the Sites: The Elvis Tourist
In This Chapter
▶ Taking a tour of Graceland
▶ Revisiting Sun Studio where it all began
▶ Considering a jaunt to other Elvis destinations
▶ Remembering Tupelo, Elvis’s birthplace
A
 key to the continued popularity of Elvis rests with Graceland, his 
former home in Tennessee. Graceland provides fans with a tangible 
place to re-experience their appreciation of Elvis. Because Graceland 
was Elvis’s home for most of his life, fans feel a personal connection to 
the property. Other popular cultural figures, such as Marilyn Monroe and 
James Dean, can’t offer their fans the same type of visiting place. Elvis 
Presley Enterprises (the Estate) is based at Graceland, and from this 
centrally located site, the Estate organizes and generates events, products, 
and promotions to help keep Elvis’s name alive. The desire of fans and 
visitors to experience Elvis makes Graceland the hub of a very successful 
business. Personal Elvis and corporate Elvis are all in one place.
Other locations related to Elvis hold a similar connotation for both die-hard 
and casual fans as well as interested visitors. For example, Sun Studio 
reminds the Elvis tourist and music fan where rockabilly began, and the 
Tupelo birthplace takes you back to Presley’s roots, which are clearly an 
important part of his character. Additional Elvis destinations are as various 
as they are scattered, from Poplar Music, where he bought most of his 
records as a teen, to his homes away from home in the Los Angeles area.
In this chapter, I encourage you to take a tour of Elvis’s world without leaving 
your chair by offering a look at Graceland and the other Presley-related sites.
Graceland: Visiting the King’s Palace
Over 600,000 people visit Graceland every year, making it the second most 
famous home in America after the White House. But, when the house was 
first opened to the public, no one knew whether the venture would be 

292
Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
successful. The decision rested in part with Elvis’s ex-wife, Priscilla, who 
was the executor of the will and a board of trustees member. Over the years, 
Priscilla Presley was instrumental in making the kinds of decisions that 
turned Graceland into a success. Later, Elvis’s daughter, Lisa Marie, who still 
owns the house, the grounds, and her father’s possessions, took over some 
of the hands-on decisions regarding the operations of the Estate. In 2005, she 
sold controlling interest in the Estate to CKX, Inc., but Lisa Marie and Priscilla 
are still involved in the decision-making process.
Graceland is located in Whitehaven, a few miles east of Memphis at 3764 Elvis 
Presley Boulevard. For fans, the idea of “going to Graceland” has changed 
over time. In the first few years after Elvis’s death, it meant standing in front 
of the gates or mingling with friends at the strip mall across the way. When 
the house opened to the public, it meant touring the home where the key 
personal events of the singer’s life unfolded. As time went by, the phrase 
referred to touring all of Memphis for a thorough Elvis experience.
Although additional Presley-related sites have been taken over by the Estate, 
the mansion, which you can see in the color photo section, remains the 
center of the experience. Reactions to the house depend on the visitor’s own 
tastes and background. Some people find it gaudy and vulgar; others see it as 
a mansion befitting the King. This section offers an overview of Graceland — 
the first and most important stop on the Elvis Tour.
 
Graceland was more than just Elvis’s home; it was his refuge from the pres-
sures of making movies, recording music, and touring in concert. Having 
endured the death of his mother, his divorce from Priscilla, and two major 
career changes, Elvis found that Graceland was the only constant in his life.
Still devoted: Looking at Priscilla’s 
role in managing Graceland
Even though Priscilla was stashed away at Graceland for most of the 1960s, 
she had surprisingly little influence on Elvis’s career. Young and inexperi-
enced, she was Elvis’s escape from his professional world, and she devoted 
herself to him. (See Chapter 7 for more on Elvis and Priscilla’s relationship 
and marriage.)
In the post-death era, she has emerged as a savvy businesswoman who 
remains devoted to Elvis in a different way. She has her ex-husband’s best 
interest at heart, and she has worked hard to ensure that his legacy remains 
fulfilled. Her involvement began when Elvis’s father, Vernon, died in 1979. 
(You can read more about Elvis’s father in Chapter 2.) The Estate was 

293
 Chapter 19: Visiting the Sites: The Elvis Tourist
placed in the care of three coexecutors, or cotrustees, including Priscilla, 
accountant Joseph Banks, and the National Bank of Commerce. Though 
she and Elvis had divorced in 1973, she was Lisa Marie’s mother and had 
remained close to the family.
Priscilla and the trustees soon realized that the Estate had a cash flow prob-
lem and that the mayor of Memphis was eager to purchase the house out 
from under them for the city. To help resolve the cash shortage, Priscilla and 
the others made the decision to open Graceland to the public. In 1981, they 
hired an investment counselor to plan and execute the opening of Graceland 
and then oversee the operation. The doors to Graceland opened for the first 
tour on June 7, 1982.
 
According to MSNBC, around 21,000 visitors descended on Graceland on 
opening day. Whether all of them were able to get inside that first day is 
not known.
Over the next few years, Priscilla and the other trustees worked to honor 
Elvis’s memory and name by enhancing the Graceland experience. They 
not only generated revenue to preserve the Estate, but they also worked 
to improve Elvis’s image by eliminating the less-than-dignified shops and 
attractions that exploited his name, image, and home. Here are some 
examples of the Estate’s improvements:
 
✓ The Estate tracked down Elvis’s two airplanes and added them as an 
attraction in 1984.
 
✓ The Automobile Museum opened in 1989 in Graceland Plaza.
 
✓ Elvis Presley’s Heartbreak Hotel was developed from a nearby existing 
hotel in 1999.
Walking through the house
You will see no antiques at Graceland; none of the decor is reminiscent of 
the distant past. All the furnishings were modern when Elvis purchased 
them, though some of them appear dated today. The dire poverty of Elvis’s 
childhood, in which he was surrounded by used or handmade items, left him 
with a lifelong hatred of anything old.
Contrary to some reports, not all of Graceland is tasteless or tacky. Some 
rooms are ostentatious, even flamboyant, but the interior design of the main 
floor is no different from what was found in the homes of many wealthy 
Southerners in the 1950s and 1960s.

294
Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
 
When Graceland first opened to the public, the upstairs and kitchen remained 
off limits because one person still lived in the residence: Elvis’s Aunt Delta 
Biggs. Aunt Delta moved into the house in 1967 with her dog, Edmond, and she 
remained there until she died in 1993. After her death, more of the house was 
opened up.
The main floor of Graceland includes the living room, the dining room, the 
music room, and the kitchen. The first three rooms are decorated with white 
or gilt-edged furniture, silky fabrics, elaborate drapes, crystal chandeliers, 
marble or mirror paneling, and wall-to-wall carpeting. Most of the walls are 
white as is the carpeting. The accessories in the main rooms are royal blue, 
which was Elvis’s favorite color, and trimmed in gold. The rooms designed 
for recreation are located in the basement, and they’re more flamboyant and 
personalized than the formal rooms upstairs. For a guided tour of 
Graceland’s must-see rooms, read the following sections.
Taking a peek into the living room
The living room features a stained-glass peacock that Laukhuff Stained 
Glass of Memphis designed for Elvis in 1974. Elvis supposedly liked peacocks 
because they symbolize eternal life. A few live birds even strolled the 
grounds of Graceland at one time. However, superstition has it that dis-
playing peacocks inside a home will actually bring bad luck, adding an 
ominous note to the otherwise beautiful birds.
In 1974, Linda Thompson, Elvis’s girlfriend, had the accessories in the living 
room and music room changed to bright red. However, when Graceland 
was opened to the public, Priscilla returned them to their original colors. 
Refer to the color photo section to have a look at the peacock-themed 
living room.
Remembering the sounds from the music room
Elvis loved to play the piano and sing gospel tunes and other songs with his 
friends and family gathered around. So as soon as he purchased Graceland, 
Elvis converted the mansion’s sunroom into a music room. The music 
room, which is shown in the color photo section, is predominantly gold and 
currently contains a black Story and Clark piano. This piano is one of three 
that were used at Graceland over the years.
The piano that stayed in the room the longest was a white and gold baby 
grand, which was replaced by a grand piano that Priscilla had covered with 
gold leaf for Elvis as an anniversary gift. The gold grand piano proved too 
large for the room, according to official accounts from the Presley estate, and 
it was replaced by the black Story and Clark.

Gathering in the kitchen and dining room
The roomy kitchen is like a time capsule of the mid-1970s with its dark wood 
cabinets and avocado green, harvest gold, and maroon color scheme. Though 
the décor is from another era, it does create a warm, cozy atmosphere.
The kitchen was always open at Graceland. Friends, visitors, and staff passed 
through the house at all hours, and food was served at any time. Elvis 
appreciated the cooks’ tolerance for the unusual hours, so he treated them 
well. For example, he bought televisions for the cooks so they could watch 
their “stories” (which is what Southern women called their soap operas) 
while working in the kitchen.
The dining room became a gathering place when several members of the 
Memphis Mafia were on hand. The guys sat around the long table, telling 
stories, eating snacks, and planning their next escapades. During the 
holidays, the dining room housed the Christmas tree.
Relaxing in the TV room
The TV room, which was decorated in its present style in 1974, features 
mirrors on the ceiling and a wraparound mirrored bar with an old-fashioned 
soda fountain. A built-in jukebox from the 1950s fills one corner of the room. 
Much of Elvis’s personal record collection is housed here, with some discs 
dating back to his high-school days. The TV room is predominantly navy blue 
and gold, with a bold graphic of a TCB lightning bolt emblazoned on one wall. 
(See Chapter 15 for an explanation of this symbol to Elvis’s life.)
The focal point of the TV room is the bank of three televisions that are set 
side by side in a wall unit. Elvis got the idea for this arrangement from 
President Lyndon Johnson, who liked to watch the news simultaneously on 
all three networks. However, Elvis preferred watching sports.
Playing games: Discovering the pool room
The pool room is across the hall from the TV room. In 1974, Elvis had it deco-
rated with about 400 yards of rippled patchwork fabric, which still covers 
both the walls and ceiling. A large stained-glass lamp by Laukhuff Stained 
Glass hangs over the pool table, where Elvis enjoyed playing his favorite 
billiard game, eight ball. Interior designer Bill Eubanks helped decorate some 
of the rooms at Graceland, including the pool room and the TV room.
Going ape in the Jungle Room
When Graceland first opened to the public, visitors dubbed one of the rooms 
the “Jungle Room,” and the name stuck. This room was Elvis’s favorite, 
though he referred to it as the den. The 40-foot-long room, which you can see 
in the color photo section, contains massive pieces of heavy furniture with 

296
Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
fake-fur upholstery. The room is decorated in a Tahitian or Hawaiian motif, 
with hand-carved chairs and varnished, scallop-edged cypress tables that are 
accented with wooden lamps carved to resemble angry gods. Several monkey 
figurines pepper the Jungle Room, adding to the playful atmosphere. A figure 
of St. Francis, patron saint of animals, sits on a shelf by the waterfall wall, 
reflecting Elvis’s love of animals.
The story behind the flamboyant room goes something like this: After Elvis 
saw a commercial for a Memphis furniture store called Donald’s, he decided 
at the spur of the moment to drive down to the store and take a look at 
what was in stock. Within 30 minutes, he’d picked out enough furniture for 
the entire Jungle Room. Everything was delivered that same day. In other 
versions of the story, Vernon was the first to hear of Donald’s, and he began 
talking about the strange furniture sold there. Elvis, however, had already 
seen the furniture and decided to buy it, much to Vernon’s dismay.
 
In 1976, when Elvis couldn’t bring himself to record new material, RCA helped 
turn the Jungle Room into a makeshift recording studio. (See Chapter 15 for 
more information on this temporary studio and Elvis’s state of mind during 
the last months of his life.) The company parked a truck with recording 
equipment in the back and ran cables through the windows of the house. Two 
albums were recorded in the Jungle Room: From Elvis Presley Boulevard, 
Memphis, Tennessee (1976) and Moody Blue (1977), which featured Elvis’s last 
single, “Way Down.”
Strolling the grounds
If the decor of his house reveals Elvis Presley the man, then the Exhibition 
Room and the Awards Exhibit herald Elvis the musical legend. Both of these 
exhibits are located on the Graceland property. While you’re strolling the 
grounds, you also can walk past Elvis’s barn and visit his final resting place.
Viewing memorabilia in the Exhibition Room
Originally a four-bay garage in the north wing of Graceland, the space now 
called the Exhibition Room has taken many different forms over the years. In 
the 1960s it was turned into an apartment for guests. After Graceland was 
opened to the public, it became a bank of offices. In 2000, it was remodeled 
to become the Exhibition Room, which showcases collections of Elvis’s 
belongings, including his costumes and personal clothing, firearm collection, 
and badge collection.
 
The enormous number of artifacts, mementoes, and pieces of memorabilia 
stored at Graceland make it impossible to show everything at once. The 
curators routinely rotate out parts of the collection so that fans can see some-
thing different each time they visit. In addition, special exhibitions group items 
together to offer new insights into the artifacts of Elvis’s life.

297
 Chapter 19: Visiting the Sites: The Elvis Tourist
Showcasing Elvis’s success in the Awards Exhibit
The Awards Exhibit, which is located in the racquetball court in the back-
yard, showcases Elvis’s many awards, gold and platinum records, and 
famous costumes. The highlight of the exhibit is the wall of awards presented 
to Graceland by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), 
featuring all of Elvis’s gold and platinum records. Though presented in 1992, 
the wall is continually updated as Elvis continues to sell more records. 
(Flip to the color photo section to see the Awards Exhibit.)
Visiting the King in Meditation Garden
 
The emotional high point of any visit to Graceland is seeing Elvis’s grave in 
Meditation Garden behind the main house. A brick and white-columned 
peristyle encloses the small space in which Elvis, his parents, and his grand-
mother are buried. See the color photo section to view this memorable spot.
At the head of Elvis’s grave burns an eternal flame, which sits atop a marble 
base marked by a bronze plaque. The plaque bears a touching epitaph 
commissioned by his father, Vernon, a quiet man who rarely expressed him-
self regarding the extraordinary life of his famous offspring. Vernon finally 
revealed his feelings in this poignant inscription in which he remembered his 
son as “A precious gift from God.”
Seeing the House of the Rising Sun
Visitors aren’t allowed inside the barn, but the white structure and fences 
make a pretty picture alongside the green pastures where horses still 
graze. Elvis loved all animals, and throughout his life, he kept dogs, chickens, 
peacocks, horses, and even a chimpanzee at Graceland. In 1966, Elvis began 
keeping horses at Graceland. He and Priscilla became serious about horse-
back riding after he bought Priscilla a horse called Domino. Over the years, 
he purchased several horses for himself and his friends. Of all the horses, a 
stunning Palomino called Rising Sun is perhaps the most famous, and Elvis 
referred to his barn as the House of the Rising Sun. Rising Sun, who never 
missed a photo opportunity with visitors, died in 1993, outliving his master 
by 16 years.
 
In 2008, Priscilla continued the tradition of keeping horses at Graceland by 
arranging with animal rescue organizations to take in two horses that had 
suffered from neglect and cruelty and needed a new home.
Where Legends Were Born: 
Stopping by Sun Studio
Called the “Cradle Where It Rocked,” Sun Studio cultivated the exciting 
sounds of such rockabilly pioneers as Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, 
Johnny Cash, and Roy Orbison. Sun Studio, which was located on an oddly 

298
Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
shaped corner on Union Avenue, sat next to a small restaurant called 
Taylor’s, where Elvis, his producer Sam Phillips, and his band mates Scotty 
Moore and Bill Black often grabbed a bite to eat.
This section offers a description of the famous Sun Studio, where Phillips 
and Elvis cut the singer’s first five singles. Come sit at Elvis’s table at Taylor’s 
(now called the Sun Café) and soak in the history of this tiny studio that 
changed the course of music history. Elvis’s two years of recording at Sun 
Studio are detailed in Chapter 2. This section offers a look at the rest of the 
tiny studio’s history.
Sun before Elvis
In the early 1950s, Sam Phillips worked as an engineer for established 
recording studios. In 1951, he recorded what many consider to be the first 
rock ’n’ roll recording, “Rocket 88,” by Jackie Brenston and the Delta Cats.
Phillips launched the record company Sun Records in 1952 with the intention 
of recording the music of Memphis’s African American rhythm-and-blues 
artists, who found it difficult to start recording careers because of the racism 
of the times. The discs were cut at Sun Studio, the small building on Union. 
Sun Records’ first hit was Rufus Thomas’s “Bearcat,” which coincidentally 
was an answer to Willa Mae “Big Mama” Thornton’s song “Hound Dog” (see 
Chapter 4 for more details on Thornton’s song). In addition, he cut records 
with B.B. King, Little Junior Parker, Howlin’ Wolf, and Ike Turner before 
expanding into the country music market. A lot of music history took place 
within the walls of Sun Studio.
Sun Studio also doubled as the Memphis Recording Service, which was where 
Elvis first headed when he decided to cut a disc for himself in 1953. (Flip to 
Chapter 2 for more on this historic recording.) Consisting of one recording 
room, a foyer, and a tiny control room in the back, the studio could only 
record one act at a time, and it was generally Phillips who served as engineer. 
Marion Keisker was Phillips’s secretary and chief assistant, and his brother 
Judd helped out with promotion.
Sun after Elvis
It could be said that Sam Phillips peaked after Elvis left Sun Records to sign 
with RCA. Around that time, Sam discovered Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins. 
Later he recorded albums for Jerry Lee Lewis and Roy Orbison. Lesser-known 
singers, such as Charlie Feathers and Charlie Rich, also signed with the 
company, making for a roster of high-powered talent.

299
 Chapter 19: Visiting the Sites: The Elvis Tourist
 
On December 4, 1956, Elvis dropped by Sun Studio to see his old mentor, Sam 
Phillips. Carl Perkins was there cutting a new single, with Jerry Lee Lewis 
backing him on the piano. When Elvis started jamming with Perkins and Lewis, 
Phillips recorded the trio while someone phoned Sun’s latest artist, Johnny 
Cash. Cash stopped in a short time later and added his talents to the mix. A 
local Memphis reporter who was there for this historic impromptu session 
dubbed the group the Million Dollar Quartet. In 2006, the definitive version 
of this famous impromptu session was issued. Called The Complete Million 
Dollar Quartet, it was released to mark the 50th anniversary of the event. In 
2008, Colin Escott and Floyd Mutrux wrote a musical play titled Million Dollar 
Quartet to mythologize the event.
During the 1950s, the record industry began to change, with major recording 
companies jumping on the rock ’n’ roll bandwagon and stealing talent from 
small regional labels. During this chaotic period, Phillips, his record com-
pany, and his studio also were in a state of flux. He moved Sun Studio from 
706 Union to the larger 639 Madison. His brother, Judd, left the company to 
run his own label in 1958. Phillips later set up a second studio in Nashville. 
He lost his desire for producing records during the 1960s and pursued other 
interests, including investing in the Holiday Inn motel chain. In 1969, he sold 
Sun Records to Shelby Singleton, who moved the company entirely to 
Nashville.
The historic little yellow brick building on Union Avenue was eventually 
sold and became home to a plumbing company and later an auto parts 
store. In 1987, a decade after Elvis died, Grayline Tours purchased the 
building and partially restored it. Tours were offered so fans and music 
Studio B in Nashville
During the 1960s, Elvis cut the majority of his 
albums at RCA’s state-of-the-art Studio B at 30 
Music Square West in Nashville. His pop-rock 
stylings of the era were influenced by the highly 
polished sessions musicians hired by producer 
Chet Atkins. So many chart-topping singles and 
albums were recorded at Studio B that the 
facility was named the “Home of a Thousand 
Hits.” Despite this distinction, the studio closed 
in 1977.
Shortly after the studio’s closing, the Country 
Music Hall of Fame absorbed Studio B, and the 
facility was restored to its original décor and 
touted for its historical significance. In 2002, the 
Country Music Hall of Fame began conducting 
tours of Studio B for Music City’s tourists. 
Occasionally a singer or act records at the 
studio for a special occasion.
Touring the studio can be insightful for the 
thoughtful Elvis fan: It points out the contrast 
between recording for Sun Records and record-
ing for RCA. Sun Studio’s tiny, intimate space 
and relaxed, informal atmosphere lent itself to 
experimentation and simply horsing around 
with different tunes. On the other hand, RCA’s 
officious milieu and use of highly polished pro-
fessional musicians promoted set agendas, 
tight schedules, and standardization.

300
Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
aficionados could see where it all started. The studio was furnished with 
musical instruments and recording equipment from the 1950s as well as 
photos of the legends who made history there. It also operated as a working 
music studio, with musicians cutting demos or recording tunes after the 
tours were over.
 
Sun Studio became a National Historic Landmark in 2003; three years later, 
Elvis Presley Enterprises entered into a deal with Sun Studio in which the 
studio would be managed by the Estate. Though a major tourist attraction, it 
still operates a recording studio after hours. The inclusion of the studio in the 
Elvis experience placed a renewed emphasis on his rockabilly sound and the 
origins of his music, which was a much-needed step in raising awareness of 
the singer’s cultural significance.
Touring Other Elvis Sites in Memphis
In addition to Graceland and Sun Studio, other sites related to Elvis’s life in 
Memphis attract fans and tourists who hope to better understand his life and 
music. Here are some of the highlights:
 
✓ Lauderdale Courts: Located at 185 Winchester Avenue, Lauderdale 
Courts was the federally funded housing project that the Presleys called 
home from September 1949 to January 1953. Even though it was a nicely 
run housing project, Lauderdale Courts is a reminder of the poverty that 
the Presleys struggled with.
 
✓ Elvis’s first home: Elvis purchased his first house in the summer of 1956 
at 1034 Audubon Drive, which unfortunately afforded him no privacy 
from fans. Neighbors complained about the constant stream of teenagers 
in their quiet neighborhood, so the Presleys moved to Graceland the 
following spring.
 
✓ Poplar Tunes: This record store, which is located at 308 Poplar Avenue 
near Lauderdale Courts, epitomizes the 1950s record store. Elvis pur-
chased many of his favorite singles there, and when he became a local 
sensation, Poplar Tunes sold his records.
 
✓ Humes High School: Elvis attended Humes High School, located at 659 
N. Manassas Street. The school is now a junior high — and a local hot 
spot. The school operates tours that include a look at the Elvis Room, 
which features Presley-related memorabilia, and the auditorium where 
he performed in the annual talent show.
You can read more about how these sites fit into Elvis’s early life in Chapter 2.

 Chapter 19: Visiting the Sites: The Elvis Tourist
Making a Pilgrimage to Tupelo
Currently, Elvis’s birthplace in Tupelo, Mississippi, consists of the original 
two-room shotgun shack built by Vernon and his family, the Elvis A. Presley 
Memorial Chapel, and the Elvis Presley Museum and Gift Shop. The grounds 
that these structures sit on is called Elvis Presley Park.
When Elvis’s father, Vernon, built the family house during the Depression, it 
was an unpainted shotgun shack sitting on a dirt plot on Old Saltillo Road. 
However, after the city of Tupelo opened the house as a tourist attraction in 
1971, they turned it into a quaint bungalow located on the newly renamed 
Elvis Presley Drive. City officials furnished the house with amenities that the 
Presleys could never have afforded, and they hung odds and ends on the 
doorknobs and pictures on the walls. Keeping a fresh coat of white paint on 
the house also gave the structure an external neatness that it didn’t have 
when the Presleys lived there. Structural changes also were made to the 
little house, including the addition of a porch. The grounds were landscaped 
with new grass and were reorganized to include small dells with charming 
names like Gladys Glen and Lisa Lane. In effect, Tupelo’s city officials turned 
the birthplace into a quaint tourist stop, a pleasant place with charm and 
coziness. However, in dressing up the shotgun shack, they robbed it of its 
historical accuracy.
Elvis’s birthplace is a fascinating site because the shotgun shack is steeped 
in Elvis folklore. It’s also a nostalgic glimpse back in time to a simple child-
hood in the rural South. The nearby Elvis Presley Memorial Chapel reminds 
visitors of the singer’s strong faith and also offers a place of reflection and 
meditation for those who are so inclined. Also on the grounds are the Elvis 
Presley Museum and Gift Shop. The Museum features exhibits that focus on 
Elvis’ childhood.
 
While in Tupelo, be sure to drop by the Tupelo Hardware Company, Inc., 
where Gladys bought Elvis his first guitar. A signed affidavit by the store’s 
owner, which includes the story of Elvis, Gladys, and the first guitar, rests 
inside a glass case for all to see.
Exploring the California Hideaways
Making three films per year in Hollywood meant that Elvis and his entourage 
spent a fair amount of time in Los Angeles. So, the singer rented or owned 
several houses in Hollywood.

302
Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
None of Elvis’s homes in California achieved the mythic status of Graceland or 
the nostalgia of the shotgun shack in Tupelo, but two of them are interesting in 
their own ways.
 
✓ In 1961, Elvis rented a house at 565 Perugia Way in Bel Air. Elvis lived 
there off and on from 1961 to 1965. Originally called the Healy House, 
this residence was designed by Lloyd Wright in 1949 in the Southern 
California style. Wright was the son of famed architect Frank Lloyd 
Wright, and the house is often erroneously attributed to the elder 
Wright. It was once owned by the Shah of Iran, and before that movie 
star Rita Hayworth had possession.
 
✓ The only house that Elvis ever built for himself was located in Palm 
Springs at 825 Chino Road. Built in 1965, this single-story, Spanish-style, 
white stucco house featured 15 rooms and a swimming pool. Lisa Marie 
inherited the house when Elvis died, but when she became of age to 
receive her inheritance, she sold it. Among its other owners was Four 
Seasons singer Frankie Valli.

M
ore than 30 years after his death, Elvis remains a prominent figure in 
our culture. Other cultural icons have been simplified in death, being 
reduced to their most obvious connotations or traits — John Wayne as the 
spirit of the independent western hero, Marilyn Monroe as the tragic sex 
goddess, or James Dean as the rebellious youth. Elvis, on the other hand, 
has expanded his significance, making him a complex figure with multiple 
meanings and connotations. Elvis signifies different things to different groups 
of people.
To Southerners, he’s a local hero who “never got above his raising,” as they 
say in the South. To his original fans, he’s a figure who defined them as the 
first generation of teenagers to revel in youth culture. To academics, he’s a 
multicultural icon who’s rich in sociohistorical significance. To popular 
music enthusiasts, he’s the Rosetta stone of rock ’n’ roll. To his detractors, 
he’s a joke in a jumpsuit. When assessing Elvis’s importance, you must factor 
in this complexity of meaning.
Separate from the idea that Elvis Presley means different things to different 
people is an objective consideration of his true impact on American cultural 
history. Even those who harbor a negative attitude toward Elvis have to 
admit that he has a place in history.
This chapter attempts the difficult task of assessing Elvis for today’s world. 
First, I offer a summary of the cultural importance of his music, and then I 
summarize his impact on the development of youth culture. To conclude, I 
comment further on the complexities of his multifaceted image, because Elvis 
truly does offer something for everybody.

Despite spending the bulk of this book explaining the significance of Elvis 
Presley, I can’t help but recall an adage that fans are fond of quoting. Though 
attributed to Memphis Mafia member George Klein on the official Elvis Presley 
estate Web site, it’s an oft-heard opinion: “If you’re an Elvis fan, no explanation 
is necessary. If you’re not, no explanation is possible.”
Innovator and History Maker: Elvis 
Changes the Music of the 1950s
Throughout his career, the music of Elvis Presley proved to be popular and 
financially successful. His music from the 1950s, however, actually made 
history on several counts. This section summarizes and reviews the reasons 
his music from this decade is so important.
Integrating regional styles of music
Elvis’s original rockabilly music combined the sounds and styles of regional, 
grass-roots music, including country, rhythm and blues, and blues. Even 
though the young singer was attracted to diverse styles of music, including 
pop and opera, his original sound combined the elements of these regional 
flavors. Lucky for Elvis, his personal musical tastes matched those of record 
producer Sam Phillips, who went on to groom the young singer to fit his goal 
of supporting the talents of regional performers. (See Chapter 2 for a full 
discussion of Elvis’s early career and original sound.)
 
Elvis’s rockabilly style and Phillips’s goals as a producer represent an integra-
tion of white music and culture with African American music and culture. The 
fact that this musical integration occurred just prior to the movement for 
racial integration begs the questions: What is the relationship between 
popular culture and the society that produces it, and what can popular cul-
ture reveal about that society? In the case of Elvis, his music, and the tastes of 
his fans, scholars see a progression toward integration in our society before it 
was mandated by law. After scholars make a connection between pop culture 
and society, they tend to raise questions that aren’t necessarily answerable 
but provoke thought and debate: Did Elvis have an effect on people’s attitudes 
regarding integration? Did he help people accept it? Or, did he polarize the 
public further? As you can see, Elvis and rockabilly/rock ’n’ roll aren’t just part 
of a colorful fad like hula hoops and coonskin caps. Instead, they’re windows 
into issues of race, class, and sexuality in our society.

305
 Chapter 20: Understanding Elvis Today
Defying pop music standards
As a fusion of regional sounds, Elvis’s rockabilly-turned-rock-’n’-roll music 
defied the conventions of mainstream pop music as defined by the Tin Pan 
Alley tradition. (See Chapter 5 for more.) He then introduced this sound to a 
nationally based audience when he signed with RCA Victor and appeared on 
network television. As his popularity took off, so did the genre of rock ’n’ roll. 
Eventually Elvis and this controversial genre were synonymous.
 
Regionally based music and rock ’n’ roll, which had predominantly been the 
domain of small record labels, soon became enormously successful, proving 
to nationally based labels that they could make money from what many 
thought was a passing fad for a limited market. By making rock ’n’ roll a 
financially lucrative sensation, Elvis helped changed the standards and 
conventions of what constituted popular music.
He also drew attention to the regional styles that made up his sound. During 
the 1950s, one of those styles, rhythm and blues, grew in stature and popular-
ity among teenagers, partly as a result of the rise of rock ’n’ roll. In interviews 
at the time, Elvis freely talked about the importance and influence of blues 
and R&B on his music, often naming singers that reporters had never heard 
of. Detractors have claimed that Elvis stole his music from African American 
blues and R&B singers, but his country-tinged sound, willingness to credit his 
influences, and quick evolution into a rock ’n’ roll singer suggest otherwise.
 
In an interview with the Charlotte Observer on June 26, 1956, Elvis explained 
one of the origins of his music. Here’s what he said: “The colored folks been 
singing it and playing it just like I’m doin’ now, man, for more years than I 
know. They played it like that in the shanties and in their juke joints and 
nobody paid it no mind ‘til I goose it up. I got it from them. Down in Tupelo, 
Mississippi, I used to hear old Arthur Crudup bang his box the way I do now, 
and I said if I ever got to the place I could feel all old Arthur felt, I’d be a 
music man like nobody ever saw.” This quote is one of many in which Elvis 
credited his musical influences, and he was humble enough to acknowledge 
their superior musicianship.
International Conference on Elvis Presley
In the summer of 1995, the University of 
Mississippi’s Center for the Study of Southern 
Culture held the first annual International 
Conference on Elvis Presley. The purpose of the 
six-day event was to establish a forum for 
discussion among different experts who spe-
cialize in popular culture and how it relates to 
our society. The experts who were invited to the 
event included music critics, Elvis authorities, 
and scholars. These experts lectured on a 
range of subjects including “Elvis and Black 
Rhythm,” “Country Elvis,” “Elvis as Anthology,” 
and “Elvis as Southerner.”

306
Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
Influencing an important generation
Some of the music of Elvis and the other pioneer rock ’n’ rollers, such as 
Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry, and Little Richard, sounds full of vitality after 
more than 50 years, especially if the listeners understand the innovative 
combination of styles and sounds they’re listening to.
But, in the common cultural consensus today, the music of the 1950s has 
long carried a nostalgic connotation. In other words, today’s generation 
automatically perceives it as music from a time long ago. Instead, in terms of 
a direct template for contemporary musicians, the music of the 1960s tends 
to be the model they return to for inspiration and influence. They look to 
artists such as Bob Dylan, The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and James Brown.
 
However, one must remember that Elvis and his backup musicians — Scotty 
Moore, D.J. Fontana, and Bill Black — heavily influenced the 1960s generation. 
The rhythm, the beat, the sensuality, and the attitude of rock ’n’ roll all began 
with Elvis and the Blue Moon Boys. That influence can’t be underestimated.
 
Statements by 1960s musical legends acknowledge the role that Elvis played in 
their music. An oft-repeated quote by John Lennon attests to Elvis’s influence 
on The Beatles: “Before Elvis, there was nothing.”
Shaping Youth Culture in the 1950s
Before the era of Elvis, teenagers latched onto entertainers, styles of music, 
and fashions and called them their own. However, the generation that grew 
up with Elvis in their lives experienced events, situations, and changes in 
Elvis enters the Rock ’n’ Roll Hall of Fame
For his part in innovating rock ’n’ roll and turning 
it into a financially successful genre, Elvis was 
one of the first inductees into the Rock ’n’ Roll 
Hall of Fame in 1988. According to the Hall of 
Fame, Elvis “launched the rock and roll revolu-
tion with his commanding voice and charismatic 
stage presence.”
The Blue Moon Boys, Elvis’s backup musicians, 
were also inducted into the Hall of Fame. 
Rhythm guitarist Scotty Moore was inducted in 
the Sidemen category in 2000, because he 
“[counterpointed] Presley’s vocals with melodic 
yet forceful solos that helped launch the rocka-

impact on rock and roll bass playing. . . .”

society that previous generations hadn’t. Something about this generation 
was different. For one, they had more money than previous eras of teenagers. 
They also grew up during the difficulties of social integration and were 
marketed to until they became a distinct demographic in the economic 
structure. This section offers some observations on how Elvis helped shape 
the identity of the 1950s generation.
Forging an identity
Generally speaking, a prosperous economy during the 1950s helped turn 
teenagers of that era into solid consumers. Teens and young adults who held 
jobs no longer had to contribute all or part of their incomes to their families 
for survival. So with disposable income burning holes in their pockets, 
they purchased products, ate at restaurants, and sought entertainment 
marketed to their tastes and preferences. The teenagers of this decade 
emerged as a high-profile, identifiable group with their own fashion sense, 
hair styles, slang, tastes in music, preferences in movie stars, and other 
favorite pastimes. Their preferences for R&B music, rockabilly, and rock ’n’ 
roll turned these genres into moneymaking ventures for record companies. 
Clearly this popularity made young people a desirable demographic to 
market to for the music industry. (Visit Chapter 5 for more information.)
 
Elvis became a focal point around which teenage fashions, slang, and music 
swirled. The controversy over his sensual performing style emphasized the 
gap in tastes and experiences between adults and teenagers, further alienating 
teens from their parents. More than any popular performer in any previous 
era, Elvis held the allure of forbidden fruit. He bonded together teens whose 
common goal was to experience their idol by buying his records, watching 
him on TV, or going to see his movies. Elvis and the sensation he created 
helped foster a strong sense of identity within the teenagers of the 1950s.
Jailhouse Rock best depicts the image of Elvis most beloved by teenagers of 
that period. His character, Vince Everett, is sullen, cynical, and cool on the 
outside but sensitive on the inside. He wears his hair in a long ducktail, 
speaks in slang, drives a Cadillac, and wears the hippest clothes. A scene in 
which Elvis admires his girlfriend’s bathing suit captures the essence of the 
Rebel Elvis. Dressed in wide-legged pants and sporting a ducktail that stands 
tall on top of his head, Elvis looks his girl up and down, coolly remarking, 
“Flippy baby, really flippy.”
Smells like teen spirit
The youth of the 1950s may have been the first to have “teen spirit,” and Elvis 
Presley was a major rallying point behind that spirit. Being an Elvis fan in 
the face of all the adult criticism against him bonded this generation. The 
criticism compelled teens to vocalize their support of Elvis and rock ’n’ roll 
and reject the music and tastes of their parents’ generation.

308
Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
Since the 1950s, when teenagers became a distinct demographic targeted by 
marketers, each subsequent generation of young people has traveled the 
same road marked “Rite of Passage.” Rebelling against the previous genera-
tion, these teens adopt their own fashions, favorites, and fads. They revel in 
their own controversies, and latch onto new subgenres of music, which are 
labeled “dangerous” or “threatening” much like Elvis’s music was in 1956. 
Rebelling against their parents’ world, or least drawing a distinction from it, 
is a liberating step for young people that’s natural and necessary.
Offering Something to Everyone
Elvis has become what academics like to call a “mutable cultural signifier.” 
Don’t let the academic jargon scare you; it simply refers to the many historical 
and social issues regarding class, race, and gender that revolve around 
Elvis’s music, his career, and his personas so that his image conjures an 
array of diverse meanings and connotations, depending on who’s looking at 
it. Since Elvis’s death, these meanings have grown more varied and more 
complex. In fact, no other entertainer is so closely tied to so many of the 
issues and fissures that plague or disrupt society, including race, age, class, 
the American Dream, sex, excess, and success.
In other words, some people can look at a youthful Elvis and see the rebel-
lious, threatening spirit of early rock ’n’ roll; others see this image and feel 
nostalgia for a more innocent time. Similarly, some find Vegas Elvis of the 
1970s a symbol of celebrity excess and decadence that led to an early grave; 
others see this image of Elvis as a betrayal of the musical innovation of the 
1950s. Fans, on the other hand, remember the Vegas Elvis image fondly, 
because it reminds them of an era in which they seemingly had personal 
access to him in his concerts. Academics view Elvis as a fascinating study of 
race and class; certain officials in charge of the U.S. Postal Service called him 
a bad role model and a drug addict. All these assumptions are accurate.
 
This doesn’t suggest that you can make the image of Elvis mean anything 
you want. It means that his image is so rich with cultural significance that it 
simultaneously holds diverse implications, interpretations, and connotations. 
Sometimes these meanings coalesce and parallel each other; other times they 
clash and contradict. This section offers an overview of the many meanings of 
Elvis and a reminder of why he’s still an American icon of great significance.
Comparing Rebel Elvis with Vegas Elvis
During the 1950s, the press skewered Elvis the rebellious rock ’n’ roller in 
their columns, articles, and editorials. However, it’s this image of a sexy, 
controversial youth blazing a musical trail across the blandness of the pop 
music landscape that appeals the most to the mainstream public today. 
(You can read about Elvis’s treatment from the press in Chapter 5.)

309
 Chapter 20: Understanding Elvis Today
Even those who turn up their noses at Presley’s overall career express 
appreciation for his role as a pioneer of rock ’n’ roll. In this capacity, Elvis 
represents rebellion against the status quo; he’s viewed as a nonconformist 
who disrupted the complacency of the 1950s. Full of vigor, confidence, and 
optimism, this is the Elvis who continued to rock his hips while the camera 
was filming him from the waist up, knowing that everyone was imagining 
what he was doing anyway. Mainstream America loves its mavericks, rebels, 
and antiheroes, and Rebel Elvis falls into this archetype.
Most remember Vegas Elvis as a middle-aged entertainer sporting a white 
jumpsuit who played to middle-aged audiences in Las Vegas or at huge 
arenas across the country. Elvis’s original fans prefer this era of his career, 
and when they see this image, they’re reminded of his charisma as an enter-
tainer. They also remember the rituals and conventions of his 1970s concert 
performances in which he interacted with them directly. (See Chapter 13 for 
an overview of this era.) However, because the press rendered this Elvis as a 
fat, drug-rattled Vegas entertainer in a form-fitting jumpsuit, many people 
have a negative view of this phase of his career — a view that has only just 
begun to fade.
Return to sender: The Elvis stamp
The Rebel Elvis versus Vegas Elvis debate 
peaked in 1992 when the U.S. Postal Service 
allowed the public to vote on the final design for 
an Elvis stamp. It had taken years of lobbying by 
Elvis fans (led by fan Pat Geiger) before the 
Postal Service finally decided to issue a stamp 
featuring the singer. At the time, a public figure 
had to be dead ten years before the Postal 
Service considered a commemorative stamp. 
(The requirement was recently reduced to five 
years, however.) So Elvis would have been eli-
gible in 1987, but officials within the Postal 
Service adopted an elitist attitude, declaring the 
singer a bad role model and a drug addict. 
Eventually, new administrators in the U.S. Postal 
Service changed this position, paving the way 
for the stamp.
Two designs were finalized in 1992 and were 
put to a vote by the general public. The Postal 
Service issued ballots that featured two 
illustrations — one of Rebel Elvis and the other 
of Vegas Elvis. Despite modeling Vegas Elvis 
after a photo from Aloha From Hawaii, when Elvis 
looked handsome and full of life, the jumpsuit he 
was wearing alluded to “the fat Elvis.” (See 
Chapter 17 for more on the press and public’s 
misperceptions of Elvis’s weight.) The general 
public was asked to vote for one of the designs 
on the ballot and then mail the ballot to the U.S. 
Postal Service in Washington. After a voting 
period of several months, Rebel Elvis won.
Some culture critics couldn’t let Elvis fans have 
their stamp in peace. Consumer advocate Ralph 
Nader remarked that the Postal Service was 
wasteful because it spent $300,000 on the 
“Decide Which Elvis Is King” contest. Nader 
said that to break even, the company would 
have to sell a million stamps to collectors who 
would then not use them. Like many non-fans, 
Nader underestimated Elvis. After the stamp 
was issued on Elvis’s birthday in 1993, the Postal 
Service made a record profit of $31 million. As of 
2009, the Elvis stamp remains the most popular 
stamp ever produced.

310
Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
 
Vegas Elvis, who performs for middle-aged mothers in America’s lower-
middle-class playground (Las Vegas), is the essence of conformity and the 
polar opposite of Rebel Elvis. That one entertainer could connote such 
contradictory meanings and evoke such opposite responses is an example 
of Elvis’s multifaceted image.
Acknowledging his Southern roots
Elvis’s identity as a member of the Southern working class has generated 
multiple interpretations of this aspect of his image. During the 1950s, his 
Southern heritage was directly and indirectly attacked, criticized, or ridiculed 
by the mainstream media as the reason for his “inferior” musical style, mode 
of talking, and tastes in clothing. (See Chapter 5 for more on this topic.)
This prejudice against his Southern working-class background dogged him 
throughout his career. To some degree, this bias has been transferred to his 
fans and is evidenced in the media’s insistence on stereotyping the Elvis fan 
as a fawning, inarticulate Southern senior citizen in an oversized Elvis T-shirt. 
Tracking Elvis’s treatment as an outsider to mainstream culture during parts 
of his career offers insight into the tension between the dominant culture and 
other grass-roots subcultures. Elvis was often positioned as the proverbial 
“other” by the media and the mainstream public. This position caused him to 
be an open target for accusations, criticisms, and misperceptions.
 
Southerners cast Elvis’s heritage in a positive, even heroic light. The fact that 
Elvis maintained his primary residence in Memphis was a source of pride, 
because it indicated that he never “got above his raising.” This phrase alone 
reveals the importance in the region of remaining close to Southern culture 
and roots. Elvis’s expressed love of gospel music, country music, rhythm 
and blues, regional food, and regional pastimes reinforced his identity as a 
Southerner and further endeared him to Southern-based audiences.
Academics have recently embraced Elvis as a source of study. One reason for 
their interest involves his role as an integrator of musical styles indigenous 
to the South. As racial integration took hold all over the South, Elvis — a 
working class Southerner — fused the sounds of white country music with 
black blues and R&B, achieving musical and cultural integration. In studying 
Elvis, scholars of history and culture see a fascinating link between popular 
music and culture and social issues and problems.
A taste of forbidden fruit: Examining 
Elvis’s effect on his young female fans
Another side to Elvis’s image during the 1950s involves his sensuality and 
sexuality, particularly his sexual appeal to young girls. (You can read more 

311
 Chapter 20: Understanding Elvis Today
about his appeal in Chapter 5.) Drop-dead handsome, a major flirt, and 
naturally charming, Elvis Presley awakened the sexuality in his young female 
fans. And he did this without his controversial performing style in which he 
moved his hips and legs provocatively. Figure 20-1 shows a portrait of the 
handsome Elvis.
However, his performing style stirred the wrath of parents, educators, 
religious figures, newspaper editors, other entertainers, and local politicians. 
They were concerned about the effect that Elvis had on the girls in the 
audience. Though generally described with words such as “hysteria” 
or “frenzy,” the reaction of the girls was more like a sexual awakening or 
expression, which was the real fear regarding Elvis.
 
Songwriter and publicist Mae Boren Axton, who cowrote “Heartbreak Hotel” 
especially for Elvis, was fond of quoting a teenage girl she once saw at an Elvis 
concert. The girl supposedly looked at Axton and exclaimed, “He’s just one big 
hunk of forbidden fruit.”
Elvis wasn’t the first to elicit excited responses from adoring female fans. 
During the 1940s, Frank Sinatra crooned to the bobby-soxers, and 20 
years before that, Rudy Vallee stirred up the passion of flappers. However, 
the girls’ strong reactions combined with Elvis’s provocative moves brought 
out the sexual nature of the dynamic between audience and performer in 
an obvious way. To women, especially those who saw him in concert, the 
image of a handsome Elvis from any stage of his career is a reminder of their 
awareness of their sexuality as women.

Elvis drove 
his female 
fans crazy, 
even 
without his

performing 
style.

Part IV: From the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll to American Cultural Icon 
Considering other meanings 
of Elvis’s image
Besides the main interpretations of Elvis’s image and persona, which I explain 
in the preceding sections, you should also consider a few less-prominent ones 
held by various groups. Here they are in no particular order:
 
✓ On the surface, Elvis’s rags-to-riches story is the personification of the 
American Dream, making him a working-class hero.
 
✓ Elvis’s downward spiral into bizarre behavior and drug abuse make 
his decline a cautionary tale about the trap of celebrity and the road 
to excess.
 
✓ The Elvis tourist activities, particularly those during Elvis Week in 
Memphis, attract visitors from foreign countries who consider Presley 
and his fans to be indicative of the American experience.
 
✓ The tacky side of Elvis merchandizing, in which his name and image can 
be found on common household items, clothing, liquor decanters, 
license plates, and other objets d’art renders him a sort of folk hero.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
A
s an author of several books on Elvis Presley, I fre-
quently have been asked to name, comment on, or 
list the best of Presley — including songs, singles, albums, 
films, and even jumpsuits. I discovered that constructing 
these types of lists provides an expedient way to measure 
and understand Elvis Presley’s many accomplishments. In 
that spirit, I created this series of lists as a handy reference 
to the most acclaimed, influential, or just plain remarkable 
aspects of Elvis’s career, along with my views and interpre-
tations. You can read about Elvis’s best songs, albums, and 
moments. I also include a list of fictional movies that show 
Elvis as a character or symbol.
Also note the appendix, which is an extensive list of the 
important people in Elvis’s life and career.

Chapter 21
Ten Best Elvis Songs
In This Chapter
▶ Enjoying the ten best Elvis songs
▶ Discovering the details of each song
I
n this chapter, I list ten of Elvis’s best songs and offer background 
information on each. The best songs represent all phases of his career, 
including the movie era, which is the least respected era by critics and 
biographers. For each tune, I offer details about the songwriter, the era, and 
the chart status. Where relevant, I discuss the song’s role in Elvis’s career 
and anything else that might explain its importance.
 
The selections for this list were based on several criteria, including a song’s 
significance to popular music, its importance in Elvis’s career, and the 
statistics it generated (units sold, chart position, and gold or platinum status). 
In order to avoid complete repetition of songs discussed earlier in the book, 
I selected valid alternatives to some of the most well-known tunes. (See 
Chapters 4 and 13 for more examples of significant songs in Elvis’s career.)
“That’s All Right”
“That’s All Right,” Elvis’s first single, epitomized his rockabilly sound, which 
was a fusion of regional Southern styles, including country music, blues, 
and R&B. The song also featured the syncopation of the lyrics and the rever-
beration engineered by Sun Studio owner Sam Phillips, which produced an 
echo effect.
Elvis released “That’s All Right,” which was written and recorded previously 
by blues singer Arthur “Big Boy” Crudup, as a single on July 19, 1954, and it 
was a local sensation. Even though Elvis’s version of the song didn’t chart 
nationally, its importance is clearly linked to the fact that it launched the 
recording career of the 20th century’s most important singer. In 1998, the 
song was elected to the Grammy Hall of Fame; in 2007, Rolling Stone declared 
it to be “the greatest song that changed the world.”

316
Part V: The Part of Tens 
“Heartbreak Hotel”
“Heartbreak Hotel” became Elvis’s first record to sell a million copies, and it 
was the first song written especially for him with his rockabilly style in mind. 
Composed in late 1955, just before Elvis appeared on the national canvas, 
the song reveals that the singer’s style and image had permeated the music 
scene enough to be recognizable as his.
Songwriters Mae Boren Axton and Tommy Durden created the sexy, blues-
influenced tune for Elvis. The idea for the lyrics came to Durden after he read 
a newspaper article about the suicide of an anonymous soul who had left 
behind a bittersweet note reading, “I walk a lonely street.” Durden took his 
idea to Axton, a songwriter, TV personality, and publicist who had worked 
for Colonel Tom Parker, Elvis’s manager. She told Durden they should write 
the song specifically for the hot new singer. The pair composed the lyrics 
and the music in about an hour. Then Glen Reeves, a local singer, recorded a 
demo record in the style of Elvis Presley. Axton took the demo to a disc 
jockey convention in Nashville, where Elvis and Parker were putting the 
finishing touches on Presley’s deal with RCA Records. (See Chapter 4 for 
more information on his RCA deal.) She played the demo for a still-green 
Elvis who loved the song, exclaiming over and over, “Hot dog, Mae!”
Elvis recorded the song on January 10, 1956, during his first session at RCA in 
Nashville. The song exaggerated the echo that was associated with his Sun 
sound, creating a haunting, ghostly effect as Elvis sang the opening lines to 
each verse. Mournful and lonesome, the song captured the alienation of 
modern youth, Elvis’s core audience.
“Heartbreak Hotel” was released as a single on January 27, 1956. On February 
11, he sang it on national TV on Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey’s Stage Show. He 
sang it on two more Stage Show appearances and on his first guest shot on 
The Milton Berle Show. The TV exposure helped propel the song to number 
one on the Billboard Hot 100, jukebox, and country charts. The song also 
climbed to number three on the R&B chart.
“Don’t Be Cruel”
“Don’t Be Cruel” represents Elvis’s side step away from Sam Phillips’s rocka-
billy twang toward a purer rock ’n’ roll style that was influenced by the 
smoother, urban sounds of big-city songwriters. The song’s easygoing but 
fast-paced rhythm, light tone, and harmonious backup vocals by the 
Jordanaires indicate that Elvis had moved on from the Sun sound.
“Don’t Be Cruel” was written by R&B singer-songwriter Otis Blackwell. In 
Chapter 4, I relate the story of Blackwell selling this hit song for just $25 on 
Christmas Eve, 1955. The song was Elvis’s biggest-selling single of 1956, a 

317
 Chapter 21: Ten Best Elvis Songs
year in which almost all his singles broke some kind of industry record. 
“Don’t Be Cruel” was so popular that other singers borrowed it for their live 
acts, most notably Jackie Wilson, who was one of Elvis’s favorite singers. 
Wilson’s vocal mannerisms added a light, high-pitched touch to the song that 
Elvis liked. In his TV appearances, Elvis began singing it in Wilson’s style, 
which is evident in the way he pronounced “telephone” as “te-lay-phone.”
“Don’t Be Cruel” topped the pop, country, and R&B charts. It sold steadily as 
a single for several years. By 1961, it had sold more than 6 million copies.
“All Shook Up”
This charming rock ’n’ roll hit from 1957 tends to be overshadowed by Elvis’s 
other singles from that year, but “All Shook Up” racked up some impressive 
statistics in its time. The song remained at the top of the Billboard Top 100 
chart for 30 weeks — the longest of any Presley single. At the end of the year, 
it was named the Number One Single for 1957. “Heartbreak Hotel” had been 
the Number One Single for 1956, making Elvis Presley the first rock ’n’ roll 
singer to top the year-end charts for two consecutive years.
Otis Blackwell, who wrote “Don’t Be Cruel,” also penned “All Shook Up.” His 
inspiration for the title came from an ordinary conversation in the workaday 
world, though the tale has undoubtedly been exaggerated through retellings 
over the years. While working for Shalimar Music as a songwriter, Blackwell 
was sitting in the office attempting to compose a new powerhouse tune. Al 
Stanton, one of the owners of Shalimar, dropped in while drinking a bottle of 
soda. He shook up the bottle so the contents fizzed, casually remarking, 
“Why don’t you write a song called ‘All Shook Up’?” A couple of days later, 
Blackwell surprised Stanton with a draft of the song.
Blackwell didn’t write the song for Elvis. Two other singers, David Hill and 
Vicki Young, recorded it before him. When cutting his version in Hollywood 
in January 1957, Elvis overdubbed himself slapping the back of his guitar, 
recalling some of the effects of his Sun singles. While Elvis was moving on 
from the rockabilly of Sun Records, he didn’t turn his back on it completely.
“Jailhouse Rock”
Penned by the legendary rock ’n’ roll songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike 
Stoller, “Jailhouse Rock” was commissioned as the title tune for Elvis’s third 
movie, which was designed to reflect the notorious side of Elvis the Pelvis — 
the Elvis that shook his leg, swiveled his hips, and made the girls scream. The 
1957 film needed a title song that suggested the scandalous nature of rock ’n’ 
roll, and Leiber and Stoller nailed it with this tune. The production number 

318
Part V: The Part of Tens 
for this song in the movie also became an iconic image in film history. 
“Jailhouse Rock” topped the pop, country, and R&B charts. In England, it 
became the first single to ever enter the charts at number one.
 
Leiber and Stoller wrote hard-driving R&B tunes with satiric or hip lyrics that 
could be interpreted on more than one level. At first, they weren’t interested 
in writing for Elvis, because they felt he was too sentimental and too sincere. 
A bit snobby, the pair felt that Elvis’s musical foray into R&B was a fluke, and 
they were suspicious of his interest in the blues. The three met during an 
April 1957 recording session, and Leiber and Stoller changed their minds 
about Elvis after they realized his passion for music. The pair took over the 
recording sessions for the film’s music, serving as unofficial producers of 
“Jailhouse Rock,” “Treat Me Nice,” “Baby I Don’t Care,” and other songs.
“It’s Now or Never”
No one could have guessed that a reworked version of the 1901 opera-style 
song “O Sole Mio” with a cha-cha arrangement would become the King of 
Rock ’n’ Roll’s biggest-selling single. An oddity with little influence on future 
singers, 1960’s “It’s Now or Never” was nonetheless an important song in 
Elvis’s career. It reflected his ability to conquer yet another genre of music — 
pop music. It also helped Elvis move away from the rock ’n’ roll sound 
and image that he was no longer interested in after he was discharged from 
the army.
Elvis’s interest in the song goes back to the original Italian version, which 
had been recorded by Mario Lanza, an opera singer and movie star whom 
Elvis admired. Elvis also had heard the English version “There’s No 
Tomorrow,” which had been recorded by pop singer Tony Martin. While he 
was still in the army, Elvis asked his music publisher to find someone to write 
new lyrics for the song. Aaron Schroeder and Wally Gold composed the new 
lyrics in less than half an hour. Elvis was challenged by the operalike style, 
and he was attracted to the drama of it.
“It’s Now or Never” charted for 20 weeks holding the number-one slot for five 
weeks. Worldwide sales of the tune reached 20 million copies.
“Return to Sender”
Otis Blackwell cowrote “Return to Sender” with Winfield Scott for the 1962 
romantic comedy Girls! Girls! Girls! making the catchy pop tune the third 
on the list by Blackwell. Elvis’s music publishing company Hill and Range 
discouraged him from recording the work of the most talented songwriters, 
because most of them refused to sign over the rights and half the credit to 

319
 Chapter 21: Ten Best Elvis Songs
Elvis. Blackwell was an exception, at least until the early 1960s. The African 
American songwriter was attuned to the pop-rock side to Elvis’s style, and he 
successfully wrote in that direction. Blackwell penned seven songs for Elvis.
RCA released “Return to Sender” in October 1962, and it quickly sold 1 
million copies. The clever pop tune belies the accusation that none of Elvis’s 
movie music was worthy.
 
The song figures into Elvis lore in another way as well. In the 1960s, fans 
regularly sent letters to Elvis at nonexistent addresses so they would be 
marked “Return to Sender” and sent back. In 1993, when the Elvis postage 
stamp was launched, fans revived this practice so their letters addressed 
to Elvis with Elvis stamps on them would come back to the fans marked 
“Return to Sender.” Chapter 20 talks more about the controversy over the 
Elvis stamp.
“How Great Thou Art”
Originally a 19th-century Swedish hymn by Carl Boberg, “How Great Thou 
Art” was translated into English in the 1940s. George Beverly Shea first 
recorded the tune, and then the gospel quartets the Blackwood Brothers and 
the Statesmen created their own versions. Elvis became familiar with the 
song through the Blackwood Brothers.
Elvis recorded his version of the hymn in 1966 as the title track for one of his 
gospel albums. Not only did the song reflect his Southern roots and love for 
gospel music, it also sparked his interest in recording music that wasn’t 
related to movie soundtracks. Over the years Elvis had become disillusioned 
with the movie music he produced and lost all interest in recording, but 
gospel music helped bring him back to life. Legend has it that Elvis became 
so deeply involved in recording “How Great Thou Art,” stretching his voice to 
cover the necessary range, that he almost fainted.
 
In 1974, a live version of “How Great Thou Art” from the album Elvis Recorded 
Live On Stage in Memphis won a Grammy for Best Inspirational Performance.
“If I Can Dream”
“If I Can Dream” was the incredibly poignant song that Elvis sang as the 
closing number for The ’68 Comeback Special, the critically acclaimed NBC 
television program that changed the course of Elvis’s career. (You can read 
more on the special and this point in Elvis’s life in Chapter 11.) The song 
was written by the special’s musical director, W. Earl Brown. He composed 
the song in response to the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Bobby 

320
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Kennedy, which had occurred in 1968 — one of the most tumultuous years 
of the 20th century. Elvis, who was upset by the assassination of King in his 
hometown of Memphis, believed in the song’s message of tolerance and 
understanding and sang it with great passion and conviction. The large 
scale of the song, with its monumental ending, prefigures Elvis’s music of 
the 1970s.
“Suspicious Minds”
“Suspicious Minds” written by Mark James, represents the typical Presley 
song from the last phase of his career. A fast-paced heart stopper with a 
hard-driving bass line, “Suspicious Minds” blends horns, strings, and drums 
with the voices of Presley and a choir of female backup singers. The song 
gallops forward at a breakneck speed until it reaches a peak, and then it 
slows down to a quiet lull before bursting wide open once more. Elvis intro-
duced the song in 1969 during his comeback to live performances at the 
International Hotel in Vegas. “Suspicious Minds” had yet to be released as 
a single, so the Vegas audience was unfamiliar with it. Elvis’s six-minute 
performance of the song on that hot July night brought down the house.
Recorded at American Sound Studio in 1969, the song was produced by Chips 
Moman, who was responsible for what is arguably Elvis’s best album, From 
Elvis in Memphis. However, some music historians may not include this song 
on a list as one of Elvis’s best. That’s because the version released as a single 
in late 1969 was altered by Felton Jarvis after Moman had finished it, causing 
some friction with Moman’s camp.
“Suspicious Minds” became Elvis’s first number-one single since 1962 and the 
last number-one single of his career. Because these statistics make the song a 
significant one in his career, it deserves its place on a list of his best.

▶ Checking out a list of Elvis’s best albums
▶ Considering the variety of his song selection
P
aring down Elvis’s hundreds of albums into the ten best is a difficult 
task and requires a set of criteria to do it effectively. My criteria include 
cultural significance, career impact, and popularity, which together make 
for a fairly standard set of measures. However, I also use other criteria that 
are more meaningful to me. For example, I consider how an album reflects 
Elvis’s strengths as a singer and cultural figure, and I make sure that my picks 
showcase the diversity of his song selection. I also like to include the story 
behind the album if it offers insight into the music.
In discussing some of Elvis’s biggest-selling albums, the temptation to rely 
on figures, numbers, and statistics is overwhelming. But, stats can be 
misleading, inaccurate, and difficult to validate. Besides, the inclusion of 
too many numbers spoils their effectiveness. Keeping that in mind, I avoided 
relying on too many statistics, preferring to stick with those that are reliable, 
permanent, and not subject to diverse interpretations. Without further ado, I 
present my list of the ten best albums by Elvis Presley.
Elvis Presley: The First Album
A mix of rock ’n’ roll, ballads, and rhythm and blues, Elvis Presley reveals a 
red-hot 21-year-old singer who’s exploring his musical tastes. This debut 
album, which was released March 13, 1956, marked Elvis’s first recordings for 
RCA, and it represented a step away from the five rockabilly singles he had 
released through Sun Records earlier in the decade. The album hinted to fans 
that Elvis was at home with other musical genres and that he intended to 
break from the Sun sound by recording a variety of song types.
The album’s monster single, “Heartbreak Hotel,” is most like the Sun sound 
because the RCA engineers managed to re-create the echo effect that had 
been Elvis’s trademark under Sam Phillips’s guidance. But, his renditions of 

322
Part V: The Part of Tens 
“I’m Counting on You,” “Blue Moon,” and “I Was the One” reveal a powerful 
ballad singer, while his interpretation of Ray Charles’s “I Got a Woman” 
shows that he was comfortable with R&B. Elvis’s eclectic influences clearly 
helped him master different types of music, which was one of his key 
strengths as a singer. RCA filled out the album with five tracks previously 
recorded at Sun, though never released as singles. (You can read more about 
Elvis’s time with Phillips and his early musical influences in Chapter 2.)
 
The album, which cost $3.98, made $1 million for RCA less than a month 
after it was released. It reached number one on the Billboard list of Top LPs, 
remaining there for ten weeks.
Elvis’s Christmas Album: Rock 
’n’ Roll Controversy
Elvis’s Christmas Album, which includes the now classic “Blue Christmas,” 
is more than a collection of carols. It combines the new with the old, the 
radical with the traditional. Released in December 1957, this holiday album 
debuted during a time when Elvis was still generating controversy with his 
live performances. (Check out Chapter 5 to read more about this contro-
versy.) Recording the album may have been part of a strategy to counter 
the bad publicity over accusations that he was degenerate. Unfortunately, 
the strategy had uneven results. The album stayed in the top spot of the 
Billboard list of Top 100 LPs for three weeks, but some music-industry people 
and entertainment journalists were offended that a notorious rock ’n’ roller 
had the nerve to cut a Christmas album.
Several disc jockeys even refused to play cuts from the album, and those who 
did risked repercussions. At KEX in Portland, Oregon, deejay Al Priddy was 
fired for playing Elvis’s “White Christmas,” the Irving Berlin classic made 
famous by Bing Crosby. Elvis sang the carol in his style, slurring the words 
and dragging out individual words with a succession of different notes. Some 
stations banned the entire album outright, while WCFL in Chicago got carried 
away and banned all records by Elvis.
Elvis Is Back! Home from the Army
Released in 1960, Elvis Is Back! was the singer’s first LP after his discharge 
from the army. The album reveals maturity and confidence in his voice, and 
it features an eclectic assortment of songs, from a sentimental duet between 
Elvis and his friend Charlie Hodge called “I Will Be Home Again” to the pop 
stylings of “Fever” to the bluesy “Such a Night.” Unfortunately, as the 1960s 

323
 Chapter 22: Ten Best Elvis Albums
progressed, diversity and variety would become sorely lacking in Elvis’s 
albums, because he was kept busy pumping out soundtrack albums filled 
with pop tunes in the same easygoing style.
Critics and skeptics assumed his two-year absence from the music scene 
because of his army service would hurt his popularity, but sales from Elvis Is 
Back! proved them wrong. The album charted for 56 weeks, peaking at 
number two. (See Chapter 5 for more information about Elvis in the army.)
Blue Hawaii: The Movie Music
The soundtrack for the movie Blue Hawaii proves that not all of Elvis’s movie 
music was mediocre (see Chapter 7 for more about Blue Hawaii and Chapter 
8 for details on the mediocre movie music). The material was far removed 
from the rockabilly that made Elvis famous, but it’s a solid example of the 
blend of pop and rock that defined his movie music. Like the movies them-
selves, this musical style was designed to attract a mainstream audience — 
and to that end, this album was successful.
The title track of this album had been a hit for Bing Crosby back in 1937 and 
was later recorded by Gene Autry and Billy Vaughn. Recording the song 
positioned Elvis in a mainstream pop tradition. Several other songs on the 
soundtrack had also been previously released by pop singers, including 
“Moonlight Swim,” “Hawaiian Wedding Song,” and “Aloha Oe.” The romantic 
ballad “Can’t Help Falling in Love” was penned especially for the movie, but 
its tune was borrowed from an 18th century French song called “Plaisir 
d’Amour.” Very little rock ’n’ roll made its way onto the soundtrack; even 
“Rock-a-Hula Baby” is a playful takeoff on rock ’n’ roll dance crazes rather 
than a hearty rock number.
 
The goal of attracting a broad audience for the movie music worked, at least 
for this album. Issued in 1961, Blue Hawaii became Elvis’s biggest-selling LP 
during his lifetime. It reached number one on the Billboard list of Hot 100 LPs, 
and it remained in the top spot for five months. This record held out until 1977 
when Fleetwood Mac’s Rumors finally surpassed it.
How Great Thou Art: Gospel Roots
The first Elvis album produced by Felton Jarvis, How Great Thou Art (1967), 
reveals Elvis’s lifelong passion for gospel and reflects the influence of this 
music on his career. Elvis held his own alongside the gospel quartets who 
backed him on the album, including Jake Hess and the Imperials and the 
Blackwood Brothers. How Great Thou Art came along to boost Elvis’s spirits 
at a low point in his career when he was disappointed in his film career and 
disillusioned with recording movie soundtracks.

324
Part V: The Part of Tens 
As a singer born and raised in the South, Elvis had loved gospel music since 
his childhood in Tupelo, Mississippi. Listening to or singing gospel always 
soothed his soul during times of difficulty, and it reminded him of who he 
was. The album held a special place in Elvis’s heart not only because he was 
proud of his singing on this LP but also because he won his first Grammy 
Award for How Great Thou Art. (Chapter 11 provides more information on 
How Great Thou Art and Elvis’s comeback.)
From Elvis in Memphis: 
Back in the Groove
From Elvis in Memphis, which was produced by Chips Moman at American 
Sound Studio in 1969, was instrumental in forging Elvis’s musical style of the 
1970s. The large scale of the sound, the blend of musical genres, and the 
superior material by up-and-coming songwriters became hallmarks of Elvis’s 
music. (Flip to Chapter 11 to read more about From Elvis in Memphis.)
The album sold very well at the time of release, staying on the LP charts for 
24 weeks. It also was critically acclaimed; Rolling Stone declared it equal to 
the best music Elvis had ever done. The album continues to be popular 
among subsequent generations of fans. In 2000, From Elvis in Memphis was 
remastered and rereleased with bonus tracks, including some of the other 
famous songs recorded at American Sound that aren’t on the original album.
That’s the Way It Is: Elvis’s Heartsongs
Despite the title, That’s the Way It Is (1970) isn’t the soundtrack from the 
1970 documentary film of Elvis in concert. Instead, most of the songs on this 
album are about love. The album captures one of Elvis’s strengths as a 
mature singer: his ability to express the various moods of love, which include 
joy, sorrow, and loss.
Many of the songs on this album had been recorded by other singers, but 
Elvis’s heartfelt interpretations made them his own. For example, B.J. 
Thomas enjoyed a modest hit with the joyful “I Just Can’t Help Believin’” in 
1970, but Elvis offered a light, smooth version that gives the song a sense of 
intimacy. Other selections on the album expose the darker side of love, 
including “How the Web Was Woven” and “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feeling.”
 
Elvis’s version of Paul Simon’s “Bridge Over Troubled Water” resonated with 
such pain and loss that Simon supposedly remarked, “It was a bit dramatic but 
how the hell am I supposed to compete with that.”

325
 Chapter 22: Ten Best Elvis Albums
That’s the Way It Is did modestly well, eventually reaching gold status in June 
1973. Sadly, the album may have been the last one to thoroughly explore 
Elvis’s talent as a passionate ballad singer and sincere chronicler of love and 
loss. Beginning in 1971, his manager, Colonel Tom Parker, and the folks at 
RCA had difficulty coming up with decent material to record because of 
their insistence on controlling publishing rights. So, many of Elvis’s albums 
were reduced to a hodgepodge of leftover tracks, b-sides, and the occasional 
new song. (See Chapter 15 for an overview of the difficult personal and 
professional issues Elvis faced in the 1970s.)
Reconsider Baby: Ain’t 
Nothin’ But the Blues
Some of Elvis’s best albums were released after his death, including 
Reconsider Baby (1985), a blistering collection of blues and R&B tunes that 
Elvis recorded over the years. Of the hundreds of Elvis albums, this one is 
my personal favorite for several reasons:
 
✓ It reveals his appreciation for blues-related music, which goes back 
to his days as a Memphis teenager with an extremely eclectic record 
collection.
 
✓ Because he’s absolutely comfortable with the songs and music, he inter-
prets tunes by Arthur “Big Boy” Crudup, Lonnie Johnson, and Smiley 
Lewis in his own style without destroying the characteristics of the genre.
 
✓ He knows the songs, the original singers, and the Southern culture 
where blues and R&B came from.
His deep connection to blues and R&B music is evident in his interpretations 
of “One Night of Sin,” “Reconsider Baby,” “High Heel Sneakers,” and more. 
He isn’t merely visiting these African American–based musical genres, like so 
many pop-based singers did. Instead, he’s completely at home with them. 
And, that’s the key to understanding Elvis and his significance to American 
culture. Read more about Elvis’s early life in the South in Chapter 2.
The Masters Series
When BMG purchased RCA in 1986, it formed an international committee 
of record executives with a background in music history to clean up the 
Presley catalog. Interested in positively presenting Elvis’s musical legacy, the 
committee’s long-term goal involved restoring and reissuing the music as 
close to its original form as possible. The committee compiled the music in a 

326
Part V: The Part of Tens 
series of releases called the Masters Series, and fans appreciated the 
thorough approach to Elvis’s music. Each release in the Masters Series 
consists of five discs of material from one decade of Elvis’s career:
 
✓ Elvis, the King of Rock ’n’ roll: The Complete 50s Masters (1992), which 
was BMG’s first significant restoration effort, contains all of Elvis’s 
released recordings from this most popular Presley era.
 
✓ Elvis Presley: From Nashville to Memphis: The Essential 60s Masters 
(1993) bears witness to Elvis’s mature pop stylings of the 1960s, but it 
doesn’t include songs from the movie soundtracks that he recorded 
during this time.
 
✓ Walk a Mile in My Shoes: The Essential 70s Masters (1995), helps to 
dispel the stereotype of a garish Elvis in his white jumpsuit belting out 
Vegas-style tunes. The singer’s output during this time wasn’t handled 
well by RCA, who issued albums chaotically to say the least. However, 
the 120 songs in this Masters Series set show Elvis to be an all-around 
entertainer who mastered many musical genres.
ELVIS: 30 #1 Hits
In 2002, on the 25th anniversary of Elvis’s death, RCA-BMG released a collec-
tion of his number-one songs called ELV1S: 30 #1 Hits. Compiling the number-
one hits into one streamlined package on a significant anniversary reminded 
everyone — fans, the press, music historians, cultural pundits — of why Elvis 
is an important figure in American culture. And, the fact that the songs were 
arranged chronologically proved that Elvis was a significant entertainer 
during his entire career, not just in the 1950s.
In order to review the album, critics were forced to revisit the songs, and 
their updated or reassessed interpretations of Elvis’s career created new 
interest among young generations and non-fans. The success of the album 
generated feature articles putting Elvis in a historical and cultural context. 
The press, the mainstream media, and culture commentators have rarely 
given Presley his due, but this compilation directed their attention to what 
was most important about Elvis.
 
The record label capped its strategy with the best promotional line of 
Presley’s career: “Before anyone did anything, Elvis did everything.” The line 
succinctly summarized Elvis’s importance while evoking the dynamism of his 
sound and the danger of his original image. ELV1S: 30 #1 Hits rocketed to 
number one when it debuted in 2002 — a feat Elvis hadn’t managed while he 
was alive.

Ten Best Elvis Moments
In This Chapter
▶ Reflecting on memorable moments in Elvis’s career
▶ Understanding how those moments are part of our culture
I
n this chapter, I list ten memorable moments from Elvis’s career. These 
are key points — or flashbulb moments — from public appearances, 
songs, television appearances, or movie roles that influenced popular music, 
made an impact on the future, or challenged our culture to the point of 
change. Many of these moments are so familiar they have become iconic.
 
In the case of most entertainers, singers, actors, or performers, it would be 
difficult to come up with just two or three moments. The fact that this chapter 
lists ten is a testament to the cultural significance of Elvis Presley.
Performing “That’s All Right” at the 
Overton Park Shell, July 30, 1954
Just days after recording “That’s All Right,” Elvis was hastily added to the bill 
for a show starring country yodeler Slim Whitman at Memphis’s Overton 
Park Shell. Elvis was so new to the scene that the newspaper ad for the event 
misspelled his name as “Ellis Presley.” Elvis had only one single to his credit, 
and more than likely he sang both “That’s All Right” and the flip side, “Blue 
Moon of Kentucky,” on July 30, 1954, at the Overton.
According to Elvis’s rhythm guitar player, Scotty Moore, the young inexperi-
enced singer exhibited signs of extreme nervousness while singing. He 
moved constantly on the stage as he sang and played his guitar. Halfway 
through “That’s All Right,” the girls in the audience began to scream, stomp, 
and clap. After their performance was over, Elvis asked Moore what the girls 
were “hollerin’” at, and Moore replied, “It was your leg, man. It was the way 
you were shakin’ your left leg.”

328
Part V: The Part of Tens 
From that point on, Elvis began to finesse his movements on stage in order to 
elicit responses from the girls. His onstage movements became his trademark 
and the core of the controversy surrounding him — and it all started at the 
Overton. (See Chapter 2 for more information on this concert.)
Performing “Hound Dog” on The Milton 
Berle Show, June 5, 1956
The controversy swirling amorphously around rock ’n’ roll music and Elvis 
Presley during the first half of 1956 came to rest squarely on Elvis’s shoulders 
when he performed “Hound Dog” on The Milton Berle Show on June 5, 1956. 
Specifically, it was the last verse of the song that caused the trouble.
Elvis had appeared throughout the show in the comedy sketches before 
stepping in front of the camera to sing “Hound Dog.” Performing the song 
for the first time, he sang it without his guitar. Without his guitar to clutch, 
swing, or hang onto, Elvis grabbed the microphone throughout his perfor-
mance, bending it over and straddling it between his legs. At times he 
stopped, dropped his head, and then cast his eyes upward to point his finger 
at the studio audience, which resulted in full-volume screaming.
For the climax of the song, Elvis slowed down the tempo to repeat the 
chorus. While belting out this final verse to a blues beat, he turned his body 
in profile to the audience and thrust his pelvis back and forth. Accentuating 
the pelvic movements was the fact that his hand was positioned next to his 
crotch.
This memorable moment of Elvis singing this specific verse of “Hound Dog” 
on national television outraged a nation, centered the criticism of rock ’n’ roll 
on Elvis, and excited teenagers across the country. (You can read more on 
this television appearance in Chapter 4.)
Defying Authority Onstage in 
Jacksonville, August 11, 1956
Elvis had been playing across the South without incident since 1954, including 
in Jacksonville, but in 1956, his reputation as a notorious rock ’n’ roller sud-
denly made him seem like more of a threat. His act had not changed that much, 
but the perception of his act had changed a lot. Mainstream audiences thought 
him to be crude, unsophisticated, and an assault on the tastes of the status 
quo; teenagers saw him as exciting, sexy, and rebellious — and that worried 
the mainstream audience even more.

329
 Chapter 23: Ten Best Elvis Moments
Elvis seldom gave in to the rebellious side of his image; his performance in 
Jacksonville, Florida, on August 11, 1956, was one exception. Juvenile Court 
Judge Marion W. Gooding attended Elvis’s first show on August 10. After 
the show, Gooding met with Elvis and his manager Colonel Tom Parker, 
warning the singer to tone down his act. The police attended the next show 
to make sure Elvis obeyed the judge’s order. In a clever act of defiance, 
Elvis reacted to the directive by wiggling only his little finger during the 
entire performance. The gesture instigated squeals from the audience, which 
almost defeated the purpose of the judge’s order. (Flip to Chapter 4 for 
more information on this incident.)
Getting Censored on The Ed Sullivan 
Show, January 6, 1957
Perhaps the most famous moment in all of Elvis’s career was his third 
appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show in which the CBS censors allowed him 
to be shown only from the waist up. The controversy over his hip-swiveling 
performing style had come to a head, and the result was the waist-up edict.
In retrospect, this historic appearance on January 6, 1957, has come to 
represent the fears, mores, and conservative tastes of the status quo during 
the 1950s in the face of an outsider who threatened to liberate us from them. 
(Chapter 4 provides more information on this appearance.)
Performing the Title Song 
in Jailhouse Rock, 1957
The most iconic musical number in Elvis’s film career is the high-energy title 
song from Jailhouse Rock, which was released in 1957. Even those who have 
never seen the film know this production number, which captures Elvis in his 
most popular incarnation — as the young rebel who gave a generation an 
identity and an attitude.
When preparing this production number, choreographer Alex Romero first 
attempted to teach Elvis some standard steps for a more conventional 
movie-musical number. When Elvis had problems mastering them, Romero 
decided to try another approach. He watched Elvis move to his music and 
then developed steps and moves based on Elvis’s own performing style.

330
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
Some books insist that Elvis did his own choreography for the “Jailhouse 
Rock” number, but that’s a distortion of his contribution. Ultimately, however, 
the extent of Elvis’s contribution is irrelevant, because it’s his image as a 
notorious rock ’n’ roller that people respond to. (Visit Chapter 6 for more on 
Jailhouse Rock.)
Swinging with Ann-Margret 
in Viva Las Vegas, 1964
In recent years, the reputation of Viva Las Vegas (1964) has improved, partly 
because Bruce Springsteen covered the title song but also because of the reve-
lation that Elvis and Ann-Margret had a love affair on the set. The obvious 
chemistry between the two, along with the sparkling talent of Ann-Margret, 
elevates this Presley musical beyond the level of most of his movie vehicles.
Ann-Margret’s sexy, high-energy dancing style seemed to match Elvis’s hip-
swiveling performing style. As a matter of fact, she was dubbed the “Female 
Elvis Presley” during the early 1960s. The pair exhibited unbounded energy 
and a sexy charisma in their Viva Las Vegas production numbers together, 
particularly “C’mon Everybody.” Later in the film, Elvis and Ann-Margret 
danced the Climb, a wacky rock ’n’ roll dance not unlike the Jerk, the Pony, 
the Twist, and the Watusi, which were dance crazes popular during the early 
1960s. The pair’s youthful exuberance, stylish dress, and hip attitude as they 
danced the Climb epitomize the pre-hippie Swinging Sixties. (Refer to Chapter 
7 to read more on Viva Las Vegas.)
Mesmerizing a Live Audience on The ’68 
Comeback Special, December 3, 1968
One of Elvis’s finest moments occurred when he sang and reminisced about 
his career before a live audience during The ’68 Comeback Special. Looking 
handsome with his long jet-black hair and sideburns, Elvis was dressed in 
black leather from head to foot, recalling the 1950s without waxing nostalgic 
for them.
Throughout the late 1960s, the counterculture’s psychedelic music, protest 
songs, and musical pleas for peace, love, and understanding were hailed as 
anti-establishment, suggesting a cultural rebellion against the status quo. But, 
during The Comeback Special when Elvis prowled across the stage in his 
black leather ensemble growling the words to “Tiger Man,” he was rebellion 
incarnate. Raw, rough, and full of attitude, Elvis’s look and sound reminded 
everyone of just who started it all. (See Chapter 11 for more information on 
this television special.)

 Chapter 23: Ten Best Elvis Moments
Opening with “Blue Suede Shoes” at the 
International Hotel, July 31, 1969
After an eight-year absence from live performances, Elvis returned to the 
stage on July 31, 1969, at the International Hotel in Las Vegas. He burst 
onto the stage, grabbed his guitar, struck a pose, and launched into “Blue 
Suede Shoes.” The crowd jumped to their feet for the first of many standing 
ovations during the exhausting 90-minute performance.
This entire show at the International represents a true high point in Elvis’s 
career, but the opening number was the exact moment that he snatched back 
his crown as the King of Rock ’n’ Roll from the pretenders who thought he 
had given it up. (I discuss this concert in more detail in Chapter 12.)
Shaking Hands with Richard Nixon, 
December 21, 1970
On December 21, 1970, Elvis made a spontaneous decision to go to 
Washington, D.C., to visit Deputy U.S. Narcotics Director John Finlator. Even 
though Elvis said he was going to Washington to volunteer his help in the 
antidrug campaign to be a sort of “federal agent at large,” he was really 
hoping to obtain a federal narcotics badge and a complete set of credentials 
to add to his collection. Director Finlator turned down Elvis’s request for a 
badge, but this didn’t stop Elvis. He immediately decided to go over Finlator’s 
head, and with a couple of members of the Memphis Mafia, Elvis went to call 
on President Nixon at the White House. It took Elvis only a few minutes of 
laying on the charm to talk Nixon into giving him an authentic narcotics 
agent’s badge, but by then Elvis was on a roll, so he convinced the President 
to give him souvenirs inscribed with the presidential seal for his bodyguards 
and their wives.
The meeting between Elvis and Nixon resulted in a famous photograph 
session featuring the two shaking hands and posing together. Reproduced 
on postcards, T-shirts, and posters, the photos are rife with connotation 
and have been used to illustrate different facets of the Elvis Presley myth.
For example, critics use the photos’ connotation to “prove” that Elvis held 
conservative beliefs and was therefore a traitor to the rebellion that he 
symbolized in the 1950s. Others use it as a kitschy monument to the gaudy 
1970s, particularly considering Elvis donned an outrageous purple velvet suit 
to greet the President. Still others see it as a portrait of two iconic celebrities 
who faced disgrace at the end of the decade. None of these interpretations 
are necessarily accurate, but they’re all true.

332
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Performing for the World: Aloha 
from Hawaii, January 14, 1973
In a one-of-a-kind event, Elvis performed at the Honolulu International Center 
Arena in a concert that was broadcast via satellite to countries all over the 
world. Eventually, more than 1 billion people in 40 countries saw this concert. 
The concert typified Elvis’s act in the 1970s: He wore a gem-encrusted jumpsuit 
and cape, sang a diverse repertoire of contemporary and classic songs in a 
variety of genres, and performed with a huge musical ensemble that included a 
rock band, a female backup group, a gospel quartet, and an orchestra.
The moment in the show that captures the essence of Elvis from this era is 
one that thrills the fans and fuels the criticism of his detractors. At the end of 
the final song, “Can’t Help Falling in Love,” Elvis drops to one knee and bows 
his head. Then he grabs the ends of his cape in both hands, snaps his head 
up, and lifts his arms into the air in a sublime gesture that is everything you 
want it to be — corny, thrilling, gaudy, theatrical, and utterly Elvis. (Check 
out Chapter 14 to read more information about this concert.)

Chapter 24
Ten Best Elvis-Related Movies
In This Chapter
▶ Reviewing movies with Elvis as a character or a symbol
▶ Seeing how fictional films portrayed Elvis’s cultural significance
Just two years after Elvis’s death, film and television producers began to 
develop miniseries, made-for-TV films, and other projects based on the 
life and career of Elvis Presley. Elvis was given the biopic treatment, meaning 
his life story was turned into biography pictures. He also became the subject 
of documentaries. (Read Chapter 18 for more information on these films.) 
After sufficient time had passed and the mythology surrounding Elvis 
expanded and evolved, films and projects began to emerge featuring the King 
as a character in a fictional story or as a symbol in someone else’s biopic. In 
these films, Elvis either interacts with fictional characters during the course 
of the story or he acts as a potent symbol, icon, or metaphor. The figure of 
Elvis Presley is so rich with cultural meaning that each of these films can 
refer to different facets of his image or career without duplication.
In this chapter, I list ten of the most interesting cinematic depictions of Elvis 
as a character, icon, or symbol. Some of these movies may not be the best-
quality films, but their representations of Elvis are thought provoking or 
appealing and among the best examples of using Elvis’s image as a symbol.
Bye Bye Birdie
Perhaps my selection of Bye Bye Birdie cheats the concept of this chapter, 
because it was released in 1963 (before Elvis died). But, it’s an early example 
of spoofing Elvis’s larger-than-life image, and it offers a window into the 
era that launched Presley-mania. Based on a Broadway play from 1960, the 
narrative centers on the efforts of a songwriter to get the country’s most 
popular singer, Conrad Birdie, to record one of his tunes, “Just One Kiss,” 
before the singer is inducted into the army. Teenage girls all over the country 
are upset to lose their idol to the army, and they demonstrate their devotion 
by screaming, fainting, and swooning.

334
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Conrad Birdie and the antics of the teenagers spoof Elvis and the hysteria 
that surrounded him in 1958 when he was drafted into the army. The name 
Conrad Birdie is possibly based on Conway Twitty, a real-life rock ’n’ roll 
singer who was marketed like Elvis (and who later became a beloved country 
music crooner). In addition to the army and the hysterical teenagers, Conrad 
reminds the viewer of Elvis in other ways. He enunciates and exaggerates 
each syllable of each word in “Just One Kiss,” like critics accused Elvis of 
doing when he spoke and sang, and he rotates his hips in an exaggerated 
swivel. Birdie even is scheduled to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show.
Mystery Train
In this uniquely structured independent film from 1989, director Jim 
Jarmusch tells three separate stories about non-Americans stuck in Elvis’s 
hometown of Memphis, Tennessee. At the end of the third tale, the viewer 
realizes that the stories are happening simultaneously, though the characters 
have little connection to each other. They’re alienated outsiders who are 
isolated from each other and from the city’s permanent residents. (See 
Chapter 18 for more information on the plot and theme of this film.)
 
Jarmusch references Elvis throughout the film without ever showing him 
or discussing him in the dialogue. Instead, Elvis exists only on the periphery 
of the story, vaguely referred to through bits and pieces of his music, the 
commercialization of his image, and the presence of his rock ’n’ roll peers who 
have been forgotten. Note these examples from the film:
 
✓ The title of the film reminds viewers of the most haunting of Elvis’s Sun 
recordings, while the lonesome strains of “Blue Moon” are heard occa-
sionally in the film as well. Viewers recognize these songs as Elvis’s, but 
they’re only vague references to him.
 
✓ Tacky pictures of the King hang in the rooms of the rundown Arcade 
Hotel, the film’s principal setting, but they’re only poor likenesses.
 
✓ The film shows souvenirs from Graceland but doesn’t show the 
mansion.
 
✓ A creepy stranger relates an urban legend about picking up the ghost of 
Elvis hitchhiking, but a ghost story is far removed from the original.
 
✓ Two musical figures from the 1950s, Rufus Thomas and Screamin’ Jay 
Hawkins, have roles in the film, but few viewers will recognize them as 
R&B and rock ’n’ roll pioneers of Elvis’s generation.
These examples indicate that the myth of Elvis — not the authentic figure — 
permeates the film. In director Jarmusch’s eyes, Elvis has been exploited 
to the point where the real singer and his artistry no longer belong in our

ghost of the “real” Elvis appears for a brief moment. He looks confused and 
then disappears, perplexed by the world he’s no longer a part of.
Leningrad Cowboys Go America
Leningrad Cowboys Go America, a 1989 Finnish film by internationally 
acclaimed director Aki Kaurismäki, tells the story of a Russian rock ’n’ roll 
band called the Leningrad Cowboys that travels to the United States to 
seek fame and fortune. A wry comedy that exploits Kaurismäki’s strange 
sensibilities, Leningrad Cowboys Go America offers a unique look at America 
through the eyes of outsiders.
The Leningrad Cowboys wear wigs that are combed into exaggerated black 
pompadours with long black sideburns. This hairstyle is clearly a takeoff on 
Elvis’s coif from the 1970s. His look from that era is so iconic that even when 
one facet of it is isolated, we still recognize it as a reference to Elvis. Like 
Presley, the Cowboys achieve a large-scale sound by combining the talents of 
orchestras, folk musicians, dancers, and others. By referencing Elvis, the 
Cowboys are channeling his image as a larger-than-life show-business legend.
Wild at Heart
David Lynch, one of America’s most imaginative filmmakers, directed Wild at 
Heart in 1990. This bizarre road film stars Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern as 
Sailor Ripley and Lula Pace Fortuna, a young couple on the run from her 
vindictive and possessive mother. As a character, Sailor recalls Elvis, with 
his dark hair, sideburns, gold jacket, and penchant for singing ballads to 
Lula, including “Love Me” and “Love Me Tender.” By relating Sailor to Elvis, 
Lynch is referencing the myth of Elvis Presley as America’s premier rebel — 
a creative force who disrupted the status quo and pushed the limits of taste 
and expression. Much like Elvis, Lynch has strived to push the boundaries of 
standard conventions and tastes; not surprisingly, he’s an Elvis fan.
 
Cage, who leapt at the chance to play this character, is also a major Elvis fan. 
He even married Elvis’s daughter, Lisa Marie, though the two later divorced.
Honeymoon in Vegas
In this 1992 romantic comedy, Nicolas Cage plays a marriage-phobic man 
who finally agrees to wed his long-suffering fiancée played by Sarah Jessica 
Parker, as long as they tie the knot in Vegas. While there, Parker’s character 
is put off by the city’s surreal atmosphere, which is emphasized by the 

336
Part V: The Part of Tens 
legion of ridiculous Elvis impersonators of all sizes, races, and ages who 
humorously pop up in the background. The recurring joke culminates with 
the Flying Elvises, a group of 34 impersonators who sky-dive onto the Vegas 
Strip as part of their act. The impersonators are used to help show that 
Vegas is extreme, bizarre, and completely alien to Parker’s character, 
who misses her normal life consisting of her friends, family, and job as a 
schoolteacher.
 
Original and engaging, Honeymoon in Vegas boasts a soundtrack of Elvis’s best 
tunes reworked by a variety of prominent pop, rock, and country singers, 
but the film paints the impersonators as farcical, which indirectly and unfairly 
suggests that Elvis’s Vegas era was akin to a circus act.
True Romance
True Romance (1993) launched the career of Quentin Tarantino, who wrote 
the screenplay for this quirky action romance but didn’t direct it. The story 
of two misfits on the lam from violent criminals is deceptively simple; the 
film’s real artistry, however, is the smooth direction by Tony Scott and the 
pop culture homages that Tarantino uses in the screenplay. Tarantino has a 
talent for weaving pop culture references and iconography into the fabric of 
his narratives, which adds new meaning and depth to those references. It’s a 
part of his style that’s often emulated but never matched.
In True Romance, Tarantino uses Elvis as a symbol of rebellion against 
authority, rugged male individualism, and cool hipness. Whenever geeky 
protagonist Clarence needs to be assertive, Val Kilmer’s character, who 
looks a lot like Elvis, appears to him in his trademark sunglasses to advise 
Clarence to stand up for himself. Like everyone who draws strength from pop 
culture heroes who represent ideals and values they admire, Clarence draws 
strength from the rebel Elvis, though the King is never referred to by name.
Picasso at the Lapin Agile
Despite much interest, Picasso at the Lapin Agile, a play written by Steve 
Martin in 1993, has yet to be made into a movie. However, its interesting use 
of Elvis as a cultural figure warrants a place on this list. Picasso at the Lapin 
Agile finds the characters of Albert Einstein and Pablo Picasso having drinks 
at a cafe-bar called the Lapin Agile (or the Nimble Rabbit) in the artists’ 
quarter of Montmartre in Paris. Set on October 8, 1904, each genius is on the 
verge of a breakthrough in their respective fields; Einstein the scientist will 
reveal his theory of relativity in 1905, and Picasso the artist will paint Les 
Demoiselles d’Avignon in 1907. The two discuss at length the importance of 
genius and talent, the roles of art and science, commercialism, and other 
related issues.

 Chapter 24: Ten Best Elvis-Related Movies
Near the end of the play, an unidentified man known only as the Visitor drops 
in from the future. The Visitor doesn’t have a name, but his clothes and 
appearance make up a visual iconography that identifies him as Elvis Presley. 
Elvis adds another dimension to Picasso and Einstein’s debate, representing 
the idea that great genius in one’s field isn’t always the product of academic 
study or philosophical understanding.
3000 Miles to Graceland
Violent, crude, and populated by unlikable protagonists, 3000 Miles to 
Graceland (2001), directed by newcomer Demian Lichtenstein, is a controver-
sial selection for this list, because it isn’t particularly well crafted, and its 
nonstop profanity and gratuitous violence angered many Elvis fans. But, to its 
credit, the film is thought provoking in its use of Elvis iconography. Flip to 
Chapter 18 for more on the film’s plot and theme.
The film makes use of the negative connotations of Elvis’s Vegas image in 
order to paint a downbeat portrait of degenerate characters in a corrupt 
society. Elvis’s detractors associate the jewel-encrusted jumpsuits, long 
sideburns, and big sunglasses of the Vegas image with the uncultured, 
kitschy tastes of fans and the squandered talent of a once-great rock ’n’ 
roller. The film plays on this connotation by dressing its violent, unsavory 
protagonists like the most decadent of Elvis impersonators. No wonder Elvis 
fans dislike this film so much. But, by using an American icon like Elvis, who 
at the end of his career had become a drug-addicted, bloated Vegas per-
former (in the eyes of his detractors), the filmmakers underscore their theme 
about failed values in a greedy society. Viewers can disagree with the film-
makers’ assessment of Elvis’s Vegas image, but they do use it symbolically.
Walk the Line
Walk the Line, the 2005 biopic of Johnny Cash — Sun Records’ other 
pioneering rockabilly star — focuses mostly on his relationship with June 
Carter, who eventually became his wife. (See Chapter 18 for more on the 
film’s plot.) However, the first part of the film offers a wonderful portrait of 
the early days of rockabilly when Cash, Elvis, and Jerry Lee Lewis were at the 
beginning of their careers, introducing a new sound for a new generation. 
Elvis and Jerry Lee are used to represent the sexuality, vitality, and Southern 
flavor of the music. Waylon Payne portrays Lewis as a destructive prankster 
who is also a God-fearing Christian. A walking contradiction, Lewis revels in 
lighting dynamite sticks and then reminding the group that they’re all going 
to hell for singing the Devil’s music. Tyler Hilton plays Elvis as the object of 
unbridled lust for the girls in the audience.

338
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The use of Elvis in this film is the opposite of 3000 Miles to Graceland, and not 
just because the former uses Rebel Elvis and the latter Vegas Elvis. Walk the 
Line uses Elvis and Jerry Lee to paint an exuberant portrait of rockabilly as 
the expression of uninhibited Southern spirit and raw sexuality. Graceland is 
a dark, pessimistic vision of sleazy corruption.
 
That one cultural figure could be used to symbolize opposing ideas is a 
testament to Elvis’s complexity as an icon.
Hounddog
Directed by Deborah Kampmeier, Hounddog (2007) is about an adolescent 
girl coming of age in the rural South in the 1950s. Dakota Fanning stars as 
Lewellen, a poor girl with a dysfunctional family who’s unaware of her 
burgeoning sexuality until she’s assaulted. She turns to her African American 
neighbor for compassion and to his music for comfort.
Filled with imagery and themes associated with Southern Gothic literature — 
such as snakes, the uplifting power of music, and the burden of class — 
the film was critically dismissed by mainstream reviewers from the North. 
Many viewers also were put off by the assault scene. But, Lewellen’s devotion 
to Elvis offers an interesting depiction of his Southern-based fans, who, in 
retrospect, are among his most devoted. Lewellen becomes obsessed with 
getting tickets to an Elvis concert, but a cruel trick robs her of this dream. 
One moonlit night, she sees Elvis, played by Ryan Pelton, driving by in his 
mythic pink Cadillac, and the singer blows her a kiss.
 
To his rural Southern fans who were born in the same grinding poverty as he 
was, Elvis represents more than a sensational singing idol from the past. He 
was one of their own who escaped the poverty and the ugly class system that 
continually keeps them down. Elvis’s “blessing” of the blown kiss represents 
hope for Lewellen that she will escape, too.

Cast of Characters
I
f you can’t keep the members of the Memphis Mafia straight, or you need 
a reminder of who Minnie Mae Presley was, a quick glance at this cast of 
characters will help you out. Beyond that, the list is an accurate, unbiased 
reference to key people in Elvis’s life and career that isn’t often found in 
other books. Many of these people have been misrepresented in previous 
books; others overlooked. This is a handy resource to the many friends, 
family members, and associates who passed through the life of the King of 
Rock ’n’ Roll.
Jean and Julian Aberbach: The Aberbach brothers owned Hill and Range 
music publishing, which was the publisher of Elvis’s entire repertoire of 
recorded music under the names Elvis Presley Music and Gladys Music. 
Hill and Range entered this arrangement with Elvis in 1955 as part of the 
complicated deal that Presley’s manager, Colonel Tom Parker, made with 
RCA Victor. The Hill and Range deal has been criticized in retrospect for 
coercing Elvis into recording inferior songs by the company’s staff writers 
because it was more lucrative for all parties than using those penned by 
independent songwriters.
Ginger Alden: Alden was Elvis’s last long-term girlfriend. She was likely the 
first person to discover his body when he died on August 16, 1977, though 
new reports at the time claimed Joe Esposito had been the first.
Ann-Margret: When red-headed singer-dancer Ann-Margret co-starred with 
Elvis in Viva Las Vegas in 1964, their onscreen chemistry soon gave way to an 
off-screen romance. Though Elvis had dated many of his movie costars, his 
relationship with Ann-Margret grew very serious despite the fact that a young 
Priscilla was sequestered in Memphis as his secret girlfriend. However, Elvis 
broke off the relationship because he decided that he didn’t want a wife who 
had a career. Instead, he intensified his relationship with Priscilla, marrying 
her on May 1, 1967. A week later, Ann-Margret married Roger Smith.
Chet Atkins: Atkins was a legendary country-music guitarist who also worked 
for RCA as a producer and engineer. He helped create the Nashville Sound, a 
smooth, pop-influenced style of country music that dominated the country 
scene during the 1960s. Atkins became Elvis’s record producer when the 
young phenomenon signed with RCA. They continued to work together until 
the mid-1960s.

Bill Belew: A Hollywood costume designer, Belew created Elvis’s black 
leather outfit for The ’68 Comeback Special. Elvis liked it so much he asked 
Belew to create his stage wardrobe when he returned to live performances in 
1969. Working from a basic sketch by Elvis’s wife, Priscilla, Belew created 
the first of the famous jumpsuits. He then went on to design each and every 
costume Elvis wore in concert.
Delta Mae Presley Biggs: When Elvis’s Aunt Delta became a widow in 1966, 
the singer moved her to Graceland as a companion for his paternal grand-
mother, Minnie Mae. Aunt Delta was the last Presley to occupy Graceland, 
remaining there until her death in 1993.
Steve Binder: Binder, a television producer-director, developed the concept 
for The ’68 Comeback Special, which presented a vibrant, invigorated Elvis 
Presley to the public in December 1968. The special revived Elvis’s interest in 
recording new material and paved the way for his return to live perfor-
mances. In 1980, Binder produced a television special about Graceland for 
Elvis Presley Enterprises (the Estate).
Bill Black: An original Blue Moon Boy, Black was the bass player who was 
part of Elvis’s backup group from the very beginning. He played with Elvis 
from 1955 to 1957. Unhappy with the low wages he was receiving compared 
to Elvis, Black quit in 1957 to form his own group, the Bill Black Combo. He 
died of a brain tumor in 1967.
Otis Blackwell: Blackwell, an African American songwriter of rock ’n’ roll 
songs, composed a handful of Elvis’s biggest hits, including “Don’t Be Cruel,” 
“All Shook Up,” and “Return to Sender.”
The Blackwood Brothers: The members of the Blackwood Brothers gospel 
quartet belonged to the same Assembly of God church that the Presleys did 
in Memphis during the 1950s. Elvis supposedly tried out for the group’s 
junior quartet of young singers called the Songfellows but didn’t make it. 
Elvis retained his acquaintance with the Blackwoods, and the quartet sang at 
Gladys Presley’s funeral in 1958 and at Elvis’s funeral in 1977.
Joe Esposito: Esposito was Elvis’s road manager and foreman of his entou-
rage, the Memphis Mafia. He worked for Elvis from 1960 to 1977. His memoirs 
of his life with Elvis are titled Elvis: Straight Up. As foreman of the entourage, 
he was informally in charge of organizational details and doling out duties to 
other members of the Memphis Mafia (except for the bodyguards, who took 
care of their own duties). Elvis and Vernon dubbed Joe’s position “foreman,” 
because it is hard to define or describe with other words. He was more than 
an assistant or valet, but he wasn’t a manager.

 Appendix: Cast of Characters
Lamar Fike: A member of the Memphis Mafia, Fike worked for Elvis over the 
years as a bodyguard, lighting systems operator, and tour organizer. Fike 
even worked for Hill and Range for a while. He incurred the wrath of Elvis 
fans forever when they learned he had told all to controversial biographer 
Albert Goldman.
D.J. Fontana: An original Blue Moon Boy, Fontana was Elvis’ drummer on 
stage from 1955 to 1958 and from 1960 to 1961. He also served as Elvis’s 
primary drummer in recording sessions from 1956 through the early 1960s. 
He returned to the fold to be Elvis’s drummer for The ’68 Comeback Special.
Alan Fortas: A Memphis Mafia member, Fortas had been a local football hero 
when he joined Elvis’s entourage in 1958 as a bodyguard. His memoirs about 
his life with Elvis are titled My Friend Elvis.
Larry Geller: Geller was Elvis’s hairstylist during the mid-1960s, but he also 
influenced Elvis in philosophical and religious matters. Geller turned Elvis on 
to the occult, parapsychology, Eastern religions, and other non-mainstream 
beliefs. Elvis became obsessed with these ideas, which eventually prompted 
the Colonel to ban Geller from further communication with the singer.
Dick Grob: A member of the Memphis Mafia, Grob served as security chief 
for more than seven years.
Lowell Hays: Hays was Elvis’s jeweler from the late 1960s through the 1970s. 
He designed the TCB ring and other TCB jewelry for Elvis and the Memphis 
Mafia. TCB was Elvis’s motto and stood for “Takin’ Care of Business.”
Dave Hebler: A martial arts expert, Hebler worked as Elvis’s bodyguard from 
1974 to 1976, when he was fired by Elvis’s father, Vernon. Hebler coauthored 
Elvis: What Happened? the infamous “bodyguard book” that exposed Elvis’s 
bizarre behavior and drug abuse, with Red and Sonny West.
Charlie Hodge: Hodge, one of Elvis’s most loyal friends, met the singer in 
1956 and remained close to him until he died in 1977. He became Elvis’s aide 
and later one of his guitarists and backup singers. During Elvis’s perfor-
mances in the 1970s, Hodge was the person who kept scarves around Elvis’s 
neck so the singer could give them to audience members. More importantly, 
Hodge was there during Elvis’s most personal moments. He drove Priscilla 
and Elvis to the hospital when Lisa Marie was born, he played bit parts in a 
few of Elvis’s movies, and he witnessed Elvis’s will.
The Imperials: The Imperials were a group of vocalists who worked with 
Elvis on the How Great Thou Art and He Touched Me albums. They also 
backed him on stage from 1969 to late 1971. Throughout the years, the 
quartet has experienced many personnel changes, but an active Imperials 
group still exists and records.

Felton Jarvis: Jarvis became Elvis’s producer at RCA in 1966, and he helped 
revitalize Elvis’s recording career by convincing him to record music not 
related to movie soundtracks. Jarvis left RCA in 1970 to devote his attention 
to Elvis’s career full time. He died in 1981.
The Jordanaires: This gospel quartet was Elvis’s primary male backup vocal 
group from 1956 to the end of the 1960s. They worked with Elvis in the 
recording studio, onstage, and in his movies. The quartet has experienced 
some personnel changes over the years, but an active Jordanaires group still 
exists.
Jackie Kahane: Kahane was the comedian who opened for Elvis during the 
1970s. He also delivered the eulogy at the singer’s funeral.
Marion Keisker: Keisker worked as Sam Phillips’s assistant, secretary, and 
Girl Friday. When Elvis came into Phillips’s American Recording Service to 
cut an acetate disc of his voice, Keisker felt the boy had talent. She taped him 
while he cut his disc so Phillips could listen to him later. Her hunch about the 
odd-looking kid with the shy manners and long ducktail haircut paid off.
George Klein: Klein is a popular Memphis entertainment and media personal-
ity. He and Elvis became friends while attending Humes High School together, 
and he became a member of the Memphis Mafia, though he didn’t work 
directly for Elvis. He maintained a separate career as a disc jockey. He intro-
duced Elvis to two of his girlfriends, Linda Thompson and Ginger Alden.
Marty Lacker: A member of the Memphis Mafia, Lacker worked for Elvis 
from 1960 to 1967 as his personal secretary and bookkeeper. Along with Joe 
Esposito, Lacker was best man at Elvis’s wedding. He and his wife, Patsy, 
wrote their memoirs about life with Elvis in a book entitled Elvis: Portrait of 
a Friend.
Bernard and Guy Lansky: The Lansky Brothers owned a clothing store on 
Beale Street in Memphis where Elvis bought his clothes during the 1950s. 
Lansky’s Clothing Emporium catered to the hipsters, the rhythm-and-blues 
artists, and other unconventional customers. Lansky’s fitted Elvis with his 
last suit, which he was buried in.
Abe Lastfogel: Lastfogel was Elvis’s personal agent at the William Morris 
talent agency in Los Angeles. Lastfogel represented Elvis in Hollywood and 
worked with Colonel Tom Parker to turn Elvis into a successful leading man 
in Hollywood.
Mississippi Slim: Born Carvel Lee Ausborn, this traditional country singer 
befriended Elvis when Presley was a boy in Tupelo, Mississippi. Slim had his 
own radio show on the local station WELO, and he allowed Elvis to sing on 
his show on at least one occasion. Elvis got a sense of what a musical career 
was like because of his friendship with Slim.

 Appendix: Cast of Characters
Chips Moman: The owner-operator of American Sound Studio in Memphis, 
Moman produced Elvis’s album From Elvis in Memphis in 1969. The album 
of new material by legitimate songwriters helped focus positive attention 
on Elvis for the first time in years and paved the way for his return to live 
performances.
Scotty Moore: An original Blue Moon Boy, Moore was Elvis’s lead guitarist on 
stage from 1954 to 1958 and from 1960 to 1961. He recorded with Elvis on 
his very first releases for Sun Records, and then continued with the singer 
when he signed with RCA Victor. He returned to work with Elvis on The ’68 
Comeback Special. Moore’s rhythm guitar solos on Elvis’s Sun recordings 
became the backbone of his rockabilly sound.
Bob Neal: Neal was the country-music disc jockey who managed Elvis in 1955 
before the singer hooked up with Colonel Tom Parker.
Dr. George Nichopoulos: Called Dr. Nick by Elvis, Nichopoulos was charged 
with overprescribing medication to Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Marty 
Lacker in 1980. After years of accusations and charges by various Tennessee 
medical authorities, Nichopoulos eventually lost his license.
Ed Parker: A member of the Memphis Mafia and a karate champion, Parker 
served as Elvis’s bodyguard during the 1970s. Parker’s book about his 
relationship with Elvis is titled Inside Elvis.
Colonel Tom Parker: Elvis’s manager from 1955 until after the singer’s death, 
the Colonel was a colorful ex-carny who was a walking contradiction. 
Seemingly crass, uneducated, and uncouth, Parker managed to steer Elvis 
clear of career-hampering controversy during the 1950s, make him the 
highest paid actor in Hollywood during the 1960s, and secure him lucrative 
deals in Vegas during the 1970s. Their complex relationship was one of the 
most unusual in show business with extreme highs and rock-bottom lows.
Dewey Phillips: One of early rock ’n’ roll’s most colorful disc jockeys, Phillips 
was the first deejay to play an Elvis record. He played “That’s All Right” 
several times in a row in early July 1954, launching Elvis’s career. Phillips 
lost his status as an important tastemaker when he could no longer hold a 
job after turning to alcohol and drugs. He died in 1968.
Sam Phillips: Phillips was the owner-operator of the American Recording 
Service in addition to Sun Records and Sun Studio, where Elvis Presley cut 
his first five singles. Phillips mentored Elvis and helped cultivate the singer’s 
rockabilly sound. Phillips, who was dedicated to recording the regional 
sounds of local Memphis musicians, also recorded local rhythm-and-blues 
musicians, such as Rufus Thomas, and other rockabilly singers, such as Jerry 
Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash.

Elvis For Dummies 
Dee Stanley Presley: Dee became Elvis’s stepmother in 1960. Their relation-
ship was strained from the beginning, but Elvis seemed to genuinely like her 
sons, Rick, David, and Billy Stanley. Dee and Vernon divorced in late 1977.
Gladys Love Smith Presley: Elvis and his mother, Gladys, were deeply 
devoted to one another. Though she was supportive of his singing career, 
and proud of her son, she longed for him to stay in Memphis, find a local girl, 
and settle down in marriage. Unfortunately, she didn’t live to see that. She 
died of a heart attack, complicated by liver failure, in 1958.
Lisa Marie Presley: Elvis’s only offspring, Lisa Marie was born on February 1, 
1968. After her parents divorced in 1973, Lisa lived with her mother, Priscilla 
Presley, in California, and frequently visited her father at Graceland. Priscilla 
shielded Lisa from the limelight for most of her life until she became of age to 
take her place as head of Elvis Presley Enterprises, also known as the Estate. 
In 2005, Lisa and Priscilla sold control of the Estate to CRX Enterprises, 
though both continue to make decisions regarding the Estate. Lisa, a singer 
in her own right, is one of the few female rock ’n’ rollers working today.
Minnie Mae Hood Presley: Elvis’s grandmother, Minnie Mae, joined her son 
Vernon Presley’s family in Memphis in the late 1940s after her husband left 
her. She lived with them from their days in tiny apartments in the low-rent 
areas of the city through Elvis’s years at Graceland. After Gladys died, she 
became the woman of the household, moving to Germany with Elvis and 
Vernon when the former was stationed there during his army service. Sadly, 
she outlasted both her son and grandson, dying in 1980.
Priscilla Beaulieu Presley: Elvis’s only marriage was to Priscilla, from 1967 to 
1973, though they were together for many years before marriage. Elvis met 
Priscilla during his final months in the army while stationed in Germany. She 
came to live in Memphis in the early 1960s, though few knew of her existence 
until she and Elvis were married. After Vernon Presley’s death in 1979, 
Priscilla was named one of the executors of the Estate until Lisa Marie 
Presley came of age. She was instrumental in opening Graceland to the public 
and in making other decisions to maintain Elvis’s legacy.
Vernon Presley: Vernon was Elvis’s father. He also served as the singer’s 
financial manager. Most of his job entailed keeping Elvis’s spending in check, 
and many have joked about Vernon’s thriftiness. Quiet and low key, Vernon 
preferred the background to the limelight of his famous son. But, no father 
could have loved his son more, and the death of his only child brought on his 
own passing less than two years later in 1979.
Vester Presley: Elvis’s uncle and Vernon Presley’s brother, Vester had fooled 
around with the guitar when he was younger. He supposedly showed Elvis a 
few chords when the boy first got his guitar. In his later years, Vester worked 
as a guard at the gates of Graceland, becoming a fan favorite over the years.

 Appendix: Cast of Characters
Jerry Schilling: A member of the Memphis Mafia, Schilling worked in creative 
capacities related to Elvis’s music. He also served as the manager of the Sweet 
Inspirations, Elvis’s female backup group, before striking out on his own as 
the manager of the Beach Boys. Since Elvis’s death, Schilling has worked for 
Elvis Presley Enterprises as a creative affairs director. He coproduced the ABC 
television series Elvis in 1990, among many other ventures.
Steve Sholes: Sholes was the RCA Victor executive who was instrumental in 
getting the label to sign Elvis. He closely monitored the production of Elvis’s 
first albums, fearful of the singer’s organic approach to recording. Eventually, 
he left the creative decisions to Elvis and his producers, resting on his laurels 
as the man who exposed Elvis to a national audience.
Gene Smith: Junior, Gene, and Billy Smith were Elvis’s cousins from his 
mother’s side of the family. Elvis grew up with Gene Smith, and the pair 
became good friends in addition to being cousins. When a young Elvis began 
touring the Southern circuits in 1954, Gene went with him to help out on the 
road. Elvis and Gene were very close until 1962, when they experienced a 
falling out. Later, however, Gene returned to visit Graceland regularly. Gene 
chronicled his life with Elvis in Elvis’s Man Friday in 1994.
Rick, David, and Billy Stanley: Elvis gained three stepbrothers when his 
father, Vernon Presley, married Dee Stanley in 1960. Rick and David worked 
security at Graceland when they grew up and traveled with Elvis as part of 
the entourage. Billy did odd jobs and ran errands. With their mother, Dee, 
they cowrote Elvis: We Love You Tender. They also each wrote individual 
memoirs of their relationships with Elvis.
J.D. Sumner & the Stamps Quartet: J.D. Sumner & the Stamps Quartet was 
Elvis’s backing vocal group from 1971 to 1977. Sumner’s friendship with 
Presley began in the 1950s, when Sumner, then a member of the Blackwood 
Brothers Quartet, allowed a young Elvis to get into the Ellis Auditorium 
gospel sings for free. The Stamps Quartet has changed over the years, but a 
configuration of the group still performs today.
The Sweet Inspirations: The Sweet Inspirations served as Elvis’s female 
backup group from 1969 to 1977. The group included Cissy Houston, mother 
of Whitney Houston.
TCB Band: Elvis’s rhythm group from his concert years in the 1970s was 
called the TCB Band and included James Burton (lead guitar), Glen D. Hardin 
(piano), Jerry Scheff (bass guitar), Ronnie Tutt (drums), and John Wilkinson 
(rhythm guitar). TCB stands for “Takin’ Care of Business.”
Linda Thompson: A Memphis-born beauty queen, Thompson was Elvis’s first 
serious relationship after his breakup with Priscilla. At the time she was a 
college student, but she gave up her studies to stay with Elvis from 1972 
to 1976.

Hal B. Wallis: Wallis was a well-respected film producer who made Elvis 
Presley a movie star when he signed him to a personal contract in 1956. 
Wallis thought Elvis had charisma that could transfer to the big screen, so 
he cast him in musical vehicles to showcase his talents as an entertainer. 
Wallis didn’t try to push Elvis into dramatic roles; he was content to star 
him in musical vehicles until they ran their course in terms of popularity. 
The producer opted not to pick up Elvis’s contract after Easy Come, Easy Go 
in 1967.
Red West: One of the original members of the Memphis Mafia, West was a 
star football player at Humes High School when Elvis attended. In 1956, he 
began working as a bodyguard for Elvis. During the 1960s, when Elvis became 
a Hollywood leading man, West carved out a second career for himself as 
a stunt man and then a bit player. He also cowrote some songs that Elvis 
eventually recorded, including “If Every Day Was Like Christmas” and 
“You’ll Be Gone.” West cowrote the notorious “bodyguard book,” Elvis: What 
Happened? with Dave Hebler and his cousin, Sonny West. Red later studied 
acting and became a sought-after character actor in films directed by such 
talents as Francis Coppola and Robert Altman. West’s performance in 2008’s 
Goodbye Solo earned him critical acclaim.
Sonny West: The cousin of Red West, Sonny became a member of the 
Memphis Mafia in the early 1960s, working as Elvis’s bodyguard. With Red 
and Dave Hebler, Sonny cowrote Elvis: What Happened? the book that first 
revealed Elvis’s bizarre behavior and heavy drug use. In 2005, West wrote his 
memoirs about Elvis in a book titled Elvis: Still Taking Care of Business.
Kathy Westmoreland: Westmoreland backed Elvis onstage and on recordings 
from 1970 to 1977. She’s the soprano vocalist Elvis referred to in his band 
introductions as “the little girl with the beautiful high voice.”

ELVIS IMAGES USED BY PERMISSION, ELVIS PRESLEY ENTERPRISES, INC.
Elvis Presley strikes a pose on the set of Jailhouse Rock (1957). See Chapter 6 for more on this film, which was 
developed exclusively for the star and borrowed many details from his life and career.

Elvis’s newly shorn hair, which made 
the fans flip, is evident in this army 
photo. Check out Chapter 5 for details 
about Elvis’s stint in the army.
On May 1, 1967, Elvis Presley 
married Priscilla Beaulieu. Check 
out Chapter 7 for additional 
wedding details.
The change in Elvis’s image from young rebel to 
mature leading man is evident in this publicity shot 
from the early 1960s. Part II tells you everything you 
need to know about Elvis’s career as a movie star.

Elvis bought Graceland, this 
small mansion on the outskirts of 
Memphis, in 1957 (see Chapter 5). 
Today it serves as a legendary 
tourist destination.
A Vegas-era Elvis performs in one 
of his iconic jumpsuits and capes, 
the Black Conquistador (also 
known as the Conquistador). See 
Chapter 13 for details about Elvis’s 
costume of choice throughout 
the 1970s.
This Awards Exhibit, which 
showcases Elvis’s many accolades 
and his best jumpsuits, is located 
in the racquetball building at 
Graceland. Chapter 19 has more 
information on this and other 
notable stops on the tour 
of Graceland.

 Elvis had the sunroom at Graceland 
converted into this striking gold and 
white music room. See Chapter 19 
for more about this room and other 
notable Elvis tourist destinations.
Elvis woos his audience during a live 
segment in The ’68 Comeback Special. Head 
to Chapter 11 for more information about 
the televised special that changed the 
course of the King’s career.
Elvis sings “The Lady Loves Me” 
poolside at the Flamingo Hotel 
in Viva Las Vegas (1964).

Check out the stained-glass 
peacocks displayed in the living 
room at Graceland. For more details 
about this room, see Chapter 19.
Elvis poses with wife Priscilla and daughter 
Lisa Marie. The Appendix tells you more about 
these two important women in Elvis’s life.
Elvis’s flamboyant den was 
later called the Jungle Room 
by Graceland’s many visitors. 
In this room, Elvis recorded 
the material for the final 
albums released before his 
death (see Chapter 15).

Elvis starred in 31 feature films during his 13-year 
movie career. Although many of these films fit into 
what Elvis called the “Presley Travelogue” formula, 
Chapter 9 gives you the lowdown on the films that 
broke the mold, including Flaming Star (1960).
This black leather suit has become an icon of 
The ’68 Comeback Special (shown here), which in itself 
is symbolic of Elvis’s career comeback and his return 
to live performing in Las Vegas (see Chapter 12).
Elvis made a habit of engaging in high jinks on 
the sets of his movies and of dating his costars. 
During Blue Hawaii, rumors flew about Elvis and 
Joan Blackman (left of Elvis). Chapter 7 gives 
you more behind-the-scenes information.

Elvis sings “No More” on location in Blue 
Hawaii (1961). Chapter 7 tells you more about 
this film, which provided Elvis with one of his 
signature songs, “Can’t Help Falling in Love.”
Elvis Presley’s grave (along with the graves 
of his parents and grandmother) rests 
behind Graceland in the peaceful Meditation 
Garden. See Chapter 19 for more about the 
final resting spot and Chapter 15 for more 
about the tragic death of a legend.
Elvis: Aloha from Hawaii was the first worldwide live 
satellite broadcast (1973). See Chapter 14 for more on 
this and other career highlights.

Despite his death in 1977, Elvis — dressed here in the Blue Nail jumpsuit (aka the Powder Blue) — is often the year’s 
highest-grossing celebrity. See Chapters 18 and 20 for more about Elvis as a significant figure in today’s culture.
