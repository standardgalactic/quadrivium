Alone in the House
of Mims
By Barth Anderson
26 April 2004
As students poured into the first two rows for
class, California maneuvered into Wyhoff's line
of sight, folding his long body into a seat near the
stage.
"Oat toast," said one student.
"Oat toast," said another.
A new girl laughed and tried again. "Oat toast."
It was a game that Wyhoff played with students
and members of this acting troupe, both of
whom took classes from the director known
only as "the Big Core." Wyhoff and the troupe's
newer students were imitating upstate New
York tonight. Wyhoff claimed you could tell
where anyone in America or Canada was from
by the way they said oat toast.
"Oat. Toast," said Wyhoff, flattening the O in a
perfect Rochester. He looked like hard cold
cash in his black silk SNL! tour jacket. "C'mon,
Cali. Before the Big Core starts class. Say it."
California was turned around in his seat,
watching the game. He said the phrase, not
imitating any particular accent.
"Hmm. Sacramento? Chico State?" said
Wyhoff, impersonating California. "Dewd, c'n
yew score some owt towst?"
Everyone laughed -- it was dead on --
and California's hands got hot as he realized that
Wyhoff had been paying such close attention to
him.
The house lights went down, then came up
again, sapping the laughter and chatter from the 
Edmund Fitzgerald's little theater. The Big
Core was starting his class.
Wyhoff walked by to take a seat near T.Z.,
whispering to California, "Don't let the bastard
get you down."
"Spot, Nakamura!" The Big Core's voice came
from shadowy seats in the risers behind them.

You can never let
anyone suspect, his
mother told him. That
was the first rule she
taught him, and the last,
before she left him here
alone with It.

Pale as he was, it was
hard to believe he would
never rise from this bed.
Even in the darkest
times, she had never
really feared for him; he
had always been strong,
so strong.
Love Among the Talus

Nilufer raised her eyes to
his. It was not what
women did to men, but
she was a princess, and
he was only a bandit. "I
want to be a Witch," she
said. "A Witch and not a
Queen. I wish to be not
loved, but wise. Tell your
bandit lord, if he can give
me that, I might accept
his gift."
