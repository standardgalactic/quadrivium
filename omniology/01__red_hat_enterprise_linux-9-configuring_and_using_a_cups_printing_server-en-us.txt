CHAPTER 1. CONFIGURING PRINTING
Printing on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is based on the Common Unix Printing System (CUPS).
This documentation describes how to configure your system to be able to operate as a CUPS server.
1.1. ACTIVATING THE CUPS SERVICE
This section describes how to activate the cups service on your system.
Prerequisites
The cups package, which is available in the Appstream repository, must be installed on your
system:
# dnf install cups
Procedure
1. Start the cups service:
# systemctl start cups
2. Configure the cups service to be automatically started at boot time:
# systemctl enable cups
3. Optionally, check the status of the cups service:
$ systemctl status cups
1.2. PRINT SETTINGS TOOLS
To achieve various tasks related to printing, you can choose one of the following tools:
CUPS web user interface (UI)
GNOME Control center
WARNING
The Print Settings configuration tool, which was used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7,
is no longer available.
Tasks that you can achieve by using tools mentioned above include:
Adding and configuring a new printer

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Configuring and using a CUPS printing server

Maintaining printer configuration
Managing printer classes
Note that this documentation covers only printing in CUPS web user interface (UI). If you want to print
using GNOME Control center, you need to have a GUI available. For more information about printing
using GNOME Control center, see Handling printing using GNOME .
1.3. ACCESSING AND CONFIGURING THE CUPS WEB UI
This section describes accessing the CUPS web user interface (web UI) and configuring it to be able to
manage printing through this interface.
Procedure
1. Allow the CUPS server to listen to connections from the network by setting Port 631 in the 
/etc/cups/cupsd.conf file:
#Listen localhost:631
Port 631
WARNING
Enabling the CUPS server to listen on port 631 opens this port for any
address accessible by the server. Therefore, use this setting only in local
networks that are unreachable from an external network. Red Hat doesn’t
recommend configuring CUPS server on a publicly accessible server.
2. Allow your system to access the CUPS server by including the following directive in the 
/etc/cups/cupsd.conf file:
<Location />
Allow from <client_ip_address>
Order allow,deny
</Location>
where <client_ip_address> is the IP address of the system you want to connect to CUPS Web UI.
CUPS supports several types of values for the Allow from directive, such as subnets. For more
information, see the cupsd.conf(5) man page.

CHAPTER 1. CONFIGURING PRINTING
5

WARNING
The CUPS configuration offers the Allow from all directive in the
<Location> tags, but Red Hat recommends using this directive only in
trusted networks. The setup Allow from all enables access for all users who
can connect to the server through port 631. If you set the Port directive to
631, and the server is accessible from an outside network, anyone on the
Internet can access the CUPS service on your system.
3. Enable incoming traffic for the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) service:
# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=ipp --permanent
# firewall-cmd --reload
4. Restart the cups.service:
# systemctl restart cups
5. Open your browser, and go to http://<IP_address_of_the_CUPS_server>:631/.
All menus except for the Administration menu are now available.
If you click on the Administration menu, you receive the Forbidden message:
To acquire the access to the Administration menu, follow the instructions in Acquiring
administration access to the CUPS web UI.
1.4. ACQUIRING ADMINISTRATION ACCESS TO THE CUPS WEB UI
This section describes how to acquire administration access to the CUPS web UI.


Procedure
1. To be able to access the Administration menu in the CUPS web UI, include the following lines
in the /etc/cups/cupsd.conf file:
<Location /admin>
Allow from <your_ip_address>
Order allow,deny
</Location>
NOTE
Replace <your_ip_address> with the real IP address of your system.
2. To be able to access configuration files in the CUPS web UI, include the following in the 
/etc/cups/cupsd.conf file:
<Location /admin/conf>
AuthType Default
Require user @SYSTEM
Allow from <your_ip_address>
Order allow,deny
</Location>
NOTE
Replace <your_ip_address> with the real IP address of your system.
3. To be able to access log files in the CUPS web UI, include the following in the 
/etc/cups/cupsd.conf file:
<Location /admin/log>
AuthType Default
Require user @SYSTEM
Allow from <your_ip_address>
Order allow,deny
</Location>
NOTE
Replace <your_ip_address> with the real IP address of your system.
4. To specify the use of encryption for authenticated requests in the CUPS web UI, include 
DefaultEncryption in the /etc/cups/cupsd.conf file:
DefaultEncryption IfRequested
With this setting, you will receive an authentication window to enter the username of a user
allowed to add printers when you attempt to access the Administration menu. However, there
are also other options on how to set DefaultEncryption. For more details, see the cupsd.conf
man page.
CHAPTER 1. CONFIGURING PRINTING
7

5. Restart the cups service:
# systemctl restart cups
WARNING
If you do not restart the cups service, the changes in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf
will not be applied. Consequently, you will not be able to obtain
administration access to the CUPS web UI.
Additional resources
The cupsd.conf man page
1.5. CONFIGURING DRIVERLESS PRINTING
As an administrator, you can configure driverless printing to use printers or remote CUPS queues
without any special software.
RHEL 9 provides driverless printing support for following driverless standards:
IPP Everywhere model in CUPS supports AirPrint, IPP Everywhere and Wi-Fi Direct standards.
Driverless model in cups-filters supports the same standards as CUPS and in addition also
PCLm document format.
These standards use the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) 2.0 or higher to communicate the printer
setup, and eliminate the need to install specific drivers for specific printers. To use the printer without a
specific driver, you need to have a printer, which supports one of the driverless standards. To determine
if your printer supports a driverless standard, choose one of the following options:
Refer to the printer specification, and search for a driverless standard support or ask your
vendor.
Search for certified printers.
Determine the driverless support based on the attributes of a printer with the ipptool command.
To install a print queue on the client with IPP Everywhere model, which points to a queue on the print
server, you need to have both your remote print server and your client with RHEL 8.6 installation or
newer.
NOTE
You can verify the driverless support based on the attributes of a print server with the
ipptool command.
1.5.1. Determining printer attributes using ipptool

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Configuring and using a CUPS printing server
8

To determine if your printer or print server supports a driverless standard, you can inspect your printer
attributes using the ipptool command available in the ipptool package.
Procedure
Display attributes of a printer or a print server:
$ ipptool -tv <URI> get-printer-attributes.test
NOTE
Replace <URI> with the URI of your printer, for example 
ipp://<hostname_or_IP_address>:631/ipp/print for printers or 
ipp://<hostname_or_IP_address>:631/printers/<remote_print_queue> for
remote print queues from print servers.
Your printer or print server supports driverless printing if:
the ipp-version-supported attribute contains 2.0 or higher for IPP protocol 2.0, and
the document-format-supported attribute contains one of the supported document formats
listed in the driverless printing standards.
1.5.2. Adding a driverless printer in CUPS web UI
Since RHEL 8.6, you can add a driverless printer in the CUPS web UI and use it to print directly from an
application to network printers or print servers using CUPS, without installing any specific drivers or
software for specific printers.
Prerequisites
You have administration access to the CUPS web UI as described in Acquiring administration
access to CUPS web UI.
Your printer or print server has the IPP Everywhere standard implementation.
Open IPP port: port 631 for IPP, or port 443 for secure printing with IPPS.
Enable the ipp and ipp-client communication in the firewall of the print server.
If your destination is another CUPS server, allow remote access on the remote server, or if you
are using a network printer, open the web user interface, search for IPP related settings: IPP or
AirPrint, and enable those settings.
Procedure
1. Start the CUPS web UI as described in Accessing and configuring the CUPS.
2. In your browser, go to localhost:631 and select the Administration tab.
3. Under Printers click Add printer.
CHAPTER 1. CONFIGURING PRINTING

6. In the Connection field, enter the URI of your device and click Continue.
CHAPTER 1. CONFIGURING PRINTING
11

NOTE
The URI consists of the following parts:
protocol ipp:// or ipps:// if printer or print server supports encryption,
hostname or IP address of the printer,
port,
resource part /ipp/print for printers, or /printers/<remote_queue_name>
for remote CUPS queues.
For example: ipp://myprinter.mydomain:631/ipp/print or 
ipp://myserver.mydomain:631/printers/myqueue.
7. Add details about the new printer: name, description and location. To set a printer to be shared
over the network, check the Share This Printer checkbox.
NOTE

1.5.3. Configuring permanent print queues using cups-browsed
As an administrator, you can use the cups-browsed service from the cups-filters package to browse
queues on remote print server. The cups-browsed service creates local queues pointing to these
remote queues. A print queue is an abstraction for a printer that represents a connection to the physical
device.
1.5.3.1. Configuring permanent print queues for printers installed on remote print servers in
a different network
To locally install CUPS queues from a remote server, edit the configuration for the cups-browsed
service on the machine where you want the permanent queues pointing to the remote CUPS server.
Prerequisites
Printers in a different network must be installed on a remote server.
The IPP port in the firewall of the server is enabled.
The server is configured for remote access from a machine where cups-browsed runs, and asks
the server for queues.
Procedure
1. Edit the /etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf file and add a hostname or an IP address of the
designated server to the BrowsePoll directive:
BrowsePoll <hostname or IP-address>
2. Restart the cups-browsed service to apply the changes:
CHAPTER 1. CONFIGURING PRINTING
15

# systemctl restart cups-browsed
Verification steps
Display the list of local printers that contains your local print queues:
$ lpstat -v
Device for <remote_queue_name>: implicitclass:<remote_queue_name>
NOTE
Your printer can take several minutes to appear on the local printers list,
depending on how many queues the remote server contains. If the printer does
not appear, modify the configuration in the cups-browsed.conf file. For
example, set the value of the BrowseTimeout directive to a higher number. For
more information, see the cups-browsed.conf(5) man page.
1.6. ADDING A PRINTER WITH A CLASSIC DRIVER IN THE CUPS WEB UI
This section describes how to add a new printer using the CUPS web user interface.

IMPORTANT
To be able to add a new printer by using the CUPS web UI, you must authenticate
as a user who belongs to groups defined by SystemGroup directive in 
/etc/cups/cups-files.
Default groups:
root
sys
wheel
5. If a local printer is connected, or CUPS finds a network printer available, select the printer. If
neither local printer nor network printer is available, select one of the printer types from Other 
Network Printers, for example APP Socket/HP Jet direct, enter the IP address of the printer,
and then click Continue.
6. If you have selected for example APP Socket/HP Jet direct as shown above, enter the IP
address of the printer, and then click Continue.

Automatic installation using a self-signed certificate
Manual installation using a certificate and a private key generated by a Certification Authority
Prerequisites
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Configuring and using a CUPS printing server
22

For the cupsd daemon on the server:
1. Set the following directive in the /etc/cups/cupsd.conf file to:
Encryption Required
2. Restart the cups service:
$ sudo systemctl restart cups
Automatic installation using a self-signed certificate
With this option, CUPS generates the certificate and the key automatically.
NOTE
The self-signed certificate does not provide as strong security as certificates generated
by Identity Management (IdM), Active Directory (AD), or Red Hat Certificate System
(RHCS) Certification Authorities, but it can be used for print servers located within a
secure local network.
Procedure
1. To access the CUPS Web UI, open your browser and go to https://<server>:631
where <server> is either the server IP address or the server host name.
NOTE
When CUPS connects to a system for the first time, the browser shows a warning
about the self-signed certificate being a potential security risk.
2. To confirm that it is safe to proceed, click the Advanced…​ button.
3. Click Accept the Risk and Continue button.
CHAPTER 1. CONFIGURING PRINTING
23

CUPS now starts to use the self-generated certificate and the key.
NOTE
When you access the CUPS Web UI after an automatic installation, the browser displays a
warning icon in the address bar. This is because you added the security exception by
confirming the security risk warning. If you want to remove this warning icon permanently,
perform the manual installation with a certificate and a private key generated by a
Certification Authority.
Manual installation using a certificate and a private key generated by a Certification
Authority
For print servers located within a public network or to permanently remove the warning in the browser,
import the certificate and the key manually.
Prerequisites
You have certificate and private key files generated by IdM, AD, or by RHCS Certification
Authorities.
Procedure
1. Copy the .crt and .key files into the /etc/cups/ssl directory of the system on which you want to
use the CUPS Web UI.
2. Rename the copied files to <hostname>.crt and <hostname>.key.
Replace <hostname> with the host name of the system to which you want to connect the CUPS
Web UI.
3. Set the following permissions to the renamed files:
# chmod 644 /etc/cups/ssl/<hostname>.crt
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Configuring and using a CUPS printing server
24

# chmod 644 /etc/cups/ssl/<hostname>.key
# chown root:root /etc/cups/ssl/<hostname>.crt
# chown root:root /etc/cups/ssl/<hostname>.key
4. Restart the cups service:
# systemctl restart cupsd
1.10. USING SAMBA TO PRINT TO A WINDOWS PRINT SERVER WITH
KERBEROS AUTHENTICATION
With the samba-krb5-printing wrapper, Active Directory (AD) users who are logged in to Red Hat
Enterprise Linux can authenticate to Active Directory (AD) by using Kerberos and then print to a local
CUPS print server that forwards the print job to a Windows print server.
The benefit of this configuration is that the administrator of CUPS on Red Hat Enterprise Linux does not
need to store a fixed user name and password in the configuration. CUPS authenticates to AD with the
Kerberos ticket of the user that sends the print job.
This section describes how to configure CUPS for this scenario.
NOTE
Red Hat only supports submitting print jobs to CUPS from your local system, and not to
re-share a printer on a Samba print server.
Prerequisites
The printer that you want to add to the local CUPS instance is shared on an AD print server.
You joined the Red Hat Enterprise Linux host as a member to the AD.
CUPS is installed on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and the cups service is running. For details, see
Activating CUPS service .
The PostScript Printer Description (PPD) file for the printer is stored in the 
/usr/share/cups/model/ directory.
Procedure
1. Install the samba-krb5-printing, samba-client, and krb5-workstation packages:
# dnf install samba-krb5-printing samba-client krb5-workstation
2. Optional: Authenticate as a domain administrator and display the list of printers that are shared
on the Windows print server:
# smbclient -L win_print_srv.ad.example.com -U 
administrator@AD_KERBEROS_REALM --use-kerberos=required
 Sharename       Type      Comment
 ---------       ----      -------
CHAPTER 1. CONFIGURING PRINTING
25

 ...
 Example         Printer   Example
 ...
3. Optional: Display the list of CUPS models to identify the PPD name of your printer:
lpinfo -m
...
samsung.ppd Samsung M267x 287x Series PXL
...
You require the name of the PPD file when you add the printer in the next step.
4. Add the printer to CUPS:
# lpadmin -p "example_printer" -v smb://win_print_srv.ad.example.com/Example -m 
samsung.ppd -o auth-info-required=negotiate -E
The command uses the following options:
-p printer_name sets the name of the printer in CUPS.
-v URI_to_Windows_printer sets the URI to the Windows printer. Use the following format:
smb://host_name/printer_share_name.
-m PPD_file sets the PPD file the printer uses.
-o auth-info-required=negotiate configures CUPS to use Kerberos authentication when it
forwards print jobs to the remote server.
-E enables the printer and CUPS accepts jobs for the printer.
Verification steps
1. Log into the Red Hat Enterprise Linux host as an AD domain user.
2. Authenticate as an AD domain user:
# kinit domain_user_name@AD_KERBEROS_REALM
3. Print a file to the printer you added to the local CUPS print server:
# lp -d example_printer file
1.11. WORKING WITH CUPS LOGS
1.11.1. Types of CUPS logs
CUPS provides three different kinds of logs:
Error log - Stores error messages, warnings, and debugging messages.
Access log - Stores messages about how many times CUPS clients and web UI have been
accessed.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Configuring and using a CUPS printing server
26

Page log - Stores messages about the total number of pages printed for each print job.
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, all three types are logged centrally in systemd-journald together with
logs from other programs.
1.11.2. Accessing all CUPS logs
You can list all CUPS logs available in systemd-journald.
Procedure
Filter CUPS logs:
$ journalctl -u cups
1.11.3. Accessing CUPS logs for a specific print job
If you need to find a CUPS log for a specific print job, you can do it by filtering the logs using the ID of a
print job.
Procedure
Filter logs for a specific print job:
$ journalctl -u cups JID=N
Where N is the ID of a print job.
1.11.4. Accessing CUPS logs by specific time frame
If you need to access CUPS logs during a certain time period, you can filter the logs in systemd-
journald.
Procedure
Filter logs within the specified time frame:
$ journalctl -u cups --since=YYYY-MM-DD --until=YYYY-MM-DD
Where YYYY is year, MM is month and DD is day.
Additional resources
The journalctl(1) man page
1.11.5. Configuring the CUPS log location
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, CUPS logs are by default logged into systemd-journald service. You can
find the default configuration in the /etc/cups/cups-files.conf file:
ErrorLog syslog
CHAPTER 1. CONFIGURING PRINTING
27

IMPORTANT
Red Hat recommends keeping the default location of CUPS logs.
Procedure
To send the logs into a different location, change the ErrorLog entry in the /etc/cups/cups-
files.conf to match your required location:
ErrorLog <your_required_location>
WARNING
If you change the default location of CUPS log, you might experience SELinux
issues.
