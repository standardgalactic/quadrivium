THEORIES OF KNOWLEDGE
How to Think about What You Know 
These lectures are intended as an introduction to the philosophical 
analysis of knowledge. You can think of them as organized into roughly 
four sections.
1	 The section on the basic theories of the structure of knowledge—the theories 
lectures—comprises lectures 1 through 6.
2	 The section on the personal sources of knowledge—the personal sources 
lectures—spans lectures 6 through 16.
3	 The section on the social source of knowledge—the social sources lectures—
encompasses lectures 17 through 21.
4	 The section that introduces some special topics and cutting-edge research 
in the study of knowledge—the special topics lectures—runs from lectures 
22 to 24.
The theories lectures discuss the main divisions in philosophical theories of 
knowledge. Roughly, there are two divisions that are explored.
]
] The first division is between theories that seek to explain knowledge as 
a hierarchical system of beliefs, with more-certain beliefs serving as a 
foundation for other, less-certain beliefs; and theories that seek to explain 
knowledge as an interconnected, mutually supporting web of beliefs. The first 
type of theories are known as foundationalist theories while the second type 
are called coherentist theories.
]
] The second division is between internalist theories and externalist theories. 
Internalist theories stipulate that the resources that knowers can appeal to in 
order to support their knowledge consist solely of mental states, states that are 
in principle available to the awareness of the knowers themselves. In contrast, 
externalist theories allow that at least some of the resources on which knowers 
depend in order to support their knowledge involve states of the brain, body, 
or perhaps even the world and that knowers don’t need to have any access to 
those states in awareness.
After getting that theoretical heavy lifting out of the way, the course turns 
to a discussion of different sources of knowledge. The personal sources 
lectures discuss different sources of knowledge that have traditionally 
been thought to depend only on the resources of individual knowers.

These include your knowledge of your own internal mental states, your 
knowledge on the basis of sense perception, your memory knowledge, 
your knowledge on the basis of reason, and the knowledge that you derive 
through inference. This group of lectures concludes with a discussion of 
the topic of know-how, or ability knowledge.
The social sources lectures tackle the topic of knowledge acquired through 
communication with others. The philosophical term for such knowledge 
is testimony. Though the topic of testimony was ignored for much of 
the history of Western philosophical thought, it has recently enjoyed a 
resurgence of interest. The lectures on testimony examine three theories of 
testimony that are currently popular. You will discover that there is a great 
deal of data from social psychology that casts doubt on whether any of 
those theories can be workable, and you will be introduced to a theory that 
better fits the data. Then, that theory will be illustrated by applying it to 
discussions of how the sciences and the media contribute to our acquisition 
of knowledge.
The special topics lectures consider a few areas of cutting-edge interest in 
the theory of knowledge. These include the topic of pragmatic and moral 
encroachment—roughly, whether our pragmatic or moral commitments 
could influence whether we acquire knowledge on the basis of the evidence 
that we have. The lectures also include the age-old topic of skepticism and 
a recent philosophical theory, contextualism, that was formulated to deal 
with the skeptical challenge. The lectures end with a consideration of the 
future of philosophical reasoning about knowledge.
There is a wealth of rich topics and puzzles concerning the nature of 
knowledge, any number of which could serve as the theme for a whole 
series of lectures in their own right. At the conclusion of these lectures, 
you’ll be well positioned to explore further to discover more of the 
fascinating features of any of the topics in the discussion of knowledge that 
interest you. y

Transformative 
Experiences
C
ontrary to what you might think, the theory of 
knowledge couldn’t be more topical nowadays. Within 
the last week, have you heard a report, read an article, 
or had a conversation about fake news? What about 
artificial intelligence? Or big data? All of these pressing 
issues in contemporary society have to deal with 
knowledge: how we acquire it, how we preserve it, 
how we communicate it. And thinking philosophically 
about knowledge will help you formulate rational 
solutions to real-world problems.

RATIONAL DECISION MAKING
^
^ A recent challenge to common views 
about the extent of our knowledge 
and rationality was formulated 
by philosopher L. A. Paul in her 
book Transformative Experience and 
an accompanying article, “What 
You Can’t Expect When You’re 
Expecting.”
^
^ Paul asks us to consider a common 
way of thinking about transformative 
decisions—for example, the decision 
whether or not to have a child. It is 
a common piece of advice to suggest 
that you should approach this weighty 
decision carefully. In particular, 
people usually recommend that you 
decide in large part on the basis of 
considering what it would be like to 
have a child.
^
^ In fact, this seems to be a paradigm 
of rational decision making. First, 
you need to ensure that you are in a 
situation in terms of your maturity, 
financial security, and physical health 
to have a child. After that, you and 
your partner imagine what it would 
be like to have a child, as well as what 
it would be like to remain childless, 
and compare the two possible futures. 
Only then—when you have decided 
which of those possible scenarios 
seems to promise a more fulfilling 
and happy life—would you choose 
which course of action to pursue.
^
^ There seem to be two principles here:
]
] Transformative experience: Some 
experiences (such as becoming a 
parent for the first time) change 
your life in a fundamental way.
]
] Expected experiential value: 
In deciding whether to pursue 
transformative experiences, you 
should make that decision based 
on your expectation of the overall 
value of such experiences.
^
^ Suppose there really are 
transformative experiences. The 
problem is that, if there are, then 
making decisions about such 
experiences based on what you expect 
the value of such experiences to be 
is irrational. In other words, the two 
principles that we formulated are 
mutually inconsistent.
^
^ There are really two separate 
problems with using your imagination 
about future experiences to decide 
whether to pursue transformative 
experiences.
]
] The first problem is perhaps easier 
to explain, but it is actually the 
less significant challenge. If an 
experience is genuinely novel, 
then you won’t in fact be able to 
use your imagination to know 
what that experience is like. In the 
case of these future experiences 
that you have absolutely no 
knowledge about, it’s hard to see

A
necdotally, there has long been a recognition 
that the love of a parent for his or her child 
changes the parent in profound ways. But we 
don’t need to rely only on anecdotal evidence of 
the transformative effect of becoming a parent. 
Scientists have been able to trace such effects in the 
physiology of the brain.  
 
In a 2015 review article in the journal Cell, Dr. Ruth 
Feldman discusses the ways that the brains of both 
men and women change as a result of becoming 
new parents. She notes that such changes include 
not only hormonal changes, but also changes 
in the activity 
of the brain, as 
measured by fMRI. 
Dr. Feldman takes 
such brain activity 
to be evidence 
of a “parental 
caregiving” network 
in the brain.

how imagination can give you any 
knowledge of what such experiences 
are like.
]
] The second problem is not as 
easy to state, but it’s actually the 
more serious difficulty for the 
experiential knowledge view. The 
problem is that transformative 
experiences change the way that 
you value the experiences that you 
acquire.
^
^ What it means for an experience 
to be transformative is in part that 
it changes the way you conceive of 
a good life. In other words, having 
that transformative experience will 
change what things you take to 
be part of a good life and how you 
would rank those things in order 
of importance. For this reason, it’s 
not possible to decide whether to 
pursue a life-changing experience by 
imagining how that experience will 
bear on the quality of your life.
^
^ Philosopher L. A. Paul has 
convincingly argued that two 
commonsense principles for making 
rational decisions are in conflict. 
It can’t be the case both that 
some experiences are genuinely 
transformative and that rationality 
demands that we decide whether to 
pursue transformative experiences 
by imagining what those experiences 
are like. Does that mean that there is 
no rational way to decide whether to 
pursue such experiences?
^
^ Let’s consider the full implications 
of Paul’s challenge. Initially, you 
might wonder how terrible it would 
be if choices about transformative 
experiences were limited to a few 
dramatic cases like the choice 
whether to become a parent. 
However, if the conclusion we’ve 
arrived at so far is all we’re left 
with, that would in fact be a terrible 
result. This is because even though 
the choice as to whether to become 
a new parent is a particularly 
dramatic example of a transformative 
experience, there are many other 
experiences that must also be 
described as transformative—such 
as whether to move to a new city 
or whether to date or marry a 
certain person.
^
^ Economists speak of opportunity 
costs: the costs that result from 
the fact that pursuing one course 
of action means that you can’t 
simultaneously pursue other, 
incompatible courses of action. 
Often, when those opportunity costs 
involve the threat of missing out 
on new experiences, your decisions 
about acting will result in the kind 
of troubling situation that Paul 
describes. In other words, our lives 
are filled with many such situations 
in which we must decide whether to 
pursue what Paul calls transformative 
experiences, so the threat of not being 
able to decide rationally in such 
situations is a very great threat.

THE IMPERSONAL STRATEGY
^
^ Trying to decide whether to pursue 
a transformative experience by 
imagining that experience and then 
deciding whether that imagined 
experience is, all things considered, 
worth pursuing is not rational. There 
is, however, another way that we 
might try to decide whether to pursue 
a transformative experience.
^
^ Rather than imagining the experience, 
we could instead try to gather evidence 
about people who have pursued the 
transformative experience. Then, we 
could see whether those who have 
pursued the experience are better 
off than those who have not pursued 
the experience. In other words, we 
could completely ignore our subjective 
experiences and preferences and try to 
gather evidence impersonally in order 
to arrive at a decision.
^
^ It turns out that, in the case of 
deciding whether to become a parent, 
we might not yet have good enough 
evidence to allow us to reach a 
decision in this way. When comparing 
the happiness of two different groups, 
you have to control for other features 
that contribute to happiness, such 
as income, health, and having a 
committed romantic relationship. 
Once you control for those factors, 
most studies suggest that there is 
no difference in happiness between 
parents and childless couples. Indeed, 
some studies suggest that, if anything, 
childless couples—in the United 
States, at least—are happier than 
couples with children living at home.
^
^ Let’s leave aside these issues, however. 
There’s a deeper worry for those 
who might encourage us to adopt the 
impersonal way of deciding about the 
pursuit of transformative experiences. 
Consider the following case:
1	 Suppose the evidence is clear that 
couples who have children are 
happier than those who don’t.
2	 And suppose you are a person 
who, when you imagine what it 
would be like to have children, 
finds no appeal in that imagined 
experience.
3	 Suppose furthermore, however, 
that you’re familiar with Paul’s 
argument about the irrationality 
of using imagined experience 
to decide whether to pursue 
transformative experiences.
4	 Finally, suppose you’re very 
committed to employing a rational 
procedure to decide whether to 
become a parent.
^
^ In such a case, it would seem that the 
rational course of action would be 
to decide to have a child. And this is 
true despite the fact that the prospect 
of becoming a parent holds no appeal 
for you.

Lecture 1  Philosophy and Transformative Experiences

^
^ The good news is that there is, in 
fact, a way of deciding available to 
us—the impersonal strategy—that is 
rational. The bad news is that now, 
according to Paul, we’re faced with 
a dilemma: two options, neither 
of which is appealing. We have a 
commonsensical way of deciding 
that has turned out not to be rational 
and a rational way of deciding that 
conflicts with common sense!
^
^ Paul is certainly correct that many 
people would find it funny to decide 
based on impersonal decision making. 
Most people would rather rely on 
their own subjective impressions when 
making important life decisions. It 
can be argued, however, that our 
goal should be to make people more 
comfortable with employing decision-
making strategies that are, in fact, 
rational, rather than emphasizing 
the counterintuitive aspects of such 
rational decision-making strategies.
^
^ Indeed, there has now been a 
great deal of evidence from social 
psychology regarding the ability 
of human beings to predict their 
future happiness on the basis of 
their imagined future experiences. 
Psychologists call such predictions 
affective forecasting. Suppose 
we forget about whether it’s 
impossible to decide rationally 
about transformative experiences 
on the basis of imagining our future 
experiences. Social psychologists have 
gathered a great deal of evidence 
that the fact is that we are very poor 
affective forecasters when we rely on 
our imagined future experiences.
I
n a 2009 paper in the Journal of Experimental 
Psychology: Applied, psychologists Emma Walsh 
and Peter Ayton present a series of experiments to 
demonstrate that, when given access to both forms 
of evidence—impersonal reporting and subjective 
imagining—those who ignored their own imagined 
experiences performed better at predicting their 
future experiences.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 1  Philosophy and Transformative Experiences

^
^ In fact, studies have shown that if 
you’re given both types of evidence—
evidence that would allow you to 
imagine your future experience as 
well as evidence about the reports 
of strangers who have had the 
experience already—you would do 
better deciding simply on the basis of 
the strangers’ reports. This suggests 
that our imaginations about our own 
experiences are simply sources of 
error that we should avoid, rather 
than evidence that ought to be taken 
into account—even in combination 
with impersonal reporting.
T
hree lessons from this discussion can be drawn 
that will carry forward in subsequent lectures.
v
v Common sense is not always an accurate guide as 
to which strategies are actually useful in arriving at 
accurate information or reaching rational decisions.
v
v Subjective experience is not necessarily a source of 
useful evidence upon which to base your beliefs or 
decisions.
v
v Abstract, philosophical discussions can be enriched 
by considering evidence from empirical disciplines—
for example, in the case of transformative 
experiences, from social psychology.

QUIZ
1	 TRUE OR FALSE
The most rational way to decide 
whether to pursue some experience is 
to imagine that experience and then 
to see whether what you imagined is 
something that you’d like to pursue.
2	 Which of these are challenges to 
using expected experiential value 
to make decisions about whether to 
pursue transformative experiences?
a	 If an experience is genuinely 
transformative, you can’t imagine 
in advance what that experience 
is like.
b	 A transformative experience 
also changes how you value your 
experiences, so the significance 
that you assign to the experience 
itself can change.
c	 Both a and b.
d	 Neither a nor b.
3	 TRUE OR FALSE
Even if it’s not possible to decide 
about transformative experiences 
using expected experiential value, at 
least transformative experiences are 
not very common.
4	 According to experimental results in 
social psychology, which method is 
the best way for you to predict your 
future happiness?
a	 Simulating a future experience 
and imagining how it would 
make you feel
b	 Relying on other people’s reports 
about their experiences
c	 Weighing your own simulation 
of the future experience as well 
as others’ reports about their 
experiences and coming to some 
judgment that combines the two
5	 According to Plato’s allegory of 
the cave, why is it difficult for 
philosophers to convey their 
knowledge to others?

have better knowledge of the 
shadows cast by the puppets on 
the cave walls.

Knowledge, Truth, 
and Belief
P
hilosophers have been studying knowledge for 
thousands of years. In fact, one of the writings on 
knowledge that is still read today was written around 
369 BC. It’s one of Plato’s Socratic dialogues, the 
Theaetetus, in which Plato has Socrates discuss the 
nature of knowledge with some young Athenians, 
among them the nobleman Theaetetus. At the end of 
the dialogue, Plato, speaking through the character 
Socrates, arrives at a definition of knowledge as “true 
belief with logos,” the Greek word meaning “a reason” 
or “an account.”

12
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN KNOWLEDGE 
AND TRUE BELIEF
^
^ There is a great deal of evidence 
from developmental psychology that 
the ability to recognize instances of 
beliefs and knowledge in others is a 
fundamental ability for children. In 
fact, this ability is essential to what 
psychologists call a child’s theory of 
mind—their ability to use reasoning 
about other people’s mental states to 
explain and predict their behavior.
^
^ Research into the development 
of theory of mind in children has 
exploded since the 1980s, in no 
small part due to the initial work of 
Austrian developmental psychologists 
Josef Perner and Heinz Wimmer. 
Their first experiment, published 
in Cognition in 1983, has now been 
reproduced numerous times, with 
strikingly consistent results. The 
widely accepted implication of these 
results is that children at the age of 
three to four years are unable to form 
beliefs concerning the false beliefs 
of others.
^
^ One reason why the results regarding 
false belief are particularly significant 
is because of a connection they 
suggest between understanding 
belief and understanding truth and 
knowledge. It turns out that children’s 
abilities to make sense of belief 
develops at about the same time as 
their abilities to understand what it 
is to deceive someone intentionally. 
This would suggest that children 
begin to acquire a more sophisticated 
understanding of the meaning of 
truth at this stage.
^
^ It is also at this same time that 
children develop the ability to 
recognize the connection between a 
person’s sources of information and 
that person’s knowledge.
^
^ In his 2012 book Trusting What 
You’re Told: How Children Learn from 
Others, the Harvard developmental 
psychologist Paul Harris spells out 
a number of ways in which children 
between the ages of three and 
six begin to be sensitive to which 
informants are knowledgeable.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 2  Knowledge, Truth, and Belief

P
lato’s 2,000-year-
old theorizing 
and contemporary 
developmental 
psychological research 
agree: There’s an intimate 
connection between 
knowledge and 
true belief.
13
^
^ As Harris argues, even newborn 
children look to adults to gain 
information both about their 
environment and how to act. At the 
earliest stages, however, children base 
their trust on social and emotional 
cues: Am I familiar with this 
adult? Do I already have a positive 
emotional attachment to him or her?

^ Beginning in the preschool years, 
however—in that crucial transition 
from ages three to six that Wimmer 
and Perner also explore—children 
begin to search more for evidence 
of accuracy and reliability when 
deciding who to trust: Was the person 
in a good position to perceive the 
event he or she is reporting about? 
Has the person been accurate in the 
past? Does the person use names for 
objects that I’m familiar with in the 
way that I expect they should?
^
^ Wimmer and Perner offer a good 
summary of these connections:
b
b[A] novel cognitive skill seems to 
emerge within the period of 4 to 6 
years. Children acquire the ability 
to represent wrong beliefs and to 
construct a deceitful or truthful 
utterance relative to a person’s 
wrong beliefs. Within this period 
several other related abilities also 
emerge: children start to understand 
another person’s absence of 
knowledge … . They become able to 
construct a deceitful utterance … 
and to infer a deceptive plan from 
a critical utterance in the context of 
conflicting goals.

INEXISTENCE AND INACCESSIBILITY ARGUMENTS
^
^ The analysis of knowledge as 
involving true belief faces a significant 
challenge, however. There’s a very 
commonly held notion that belief—
being by its nature a subjective, 
individual representation of reality—is 
incompatible with objective truth.
^
^ In fact, contemporary society seems 
to be full of controversies that rest 
on different perspectives on the 
fundamental objectivity of truth. In 
a 2017 essay in The Chronicle of Higher 
Education entitled “Teaching Humility 
in an Age of Arrogance,” philosophy 
professor Michael Lynch criticizes 
the idea that there is no such thing as 
truth. He puts the argument against 
the notion of objective truth this way:
b
bThere just is no way of escaping 
your perspective or biases. Every 
time you try to get outside of your 
own perspective, you just get more 
information filtered through your 
own perspective. As a consequence, 
objective truth is just irrelevant—
either we’ll never know it or it 
doesn’t exist in the first place.
^
^ Unfortunately, although Lynch does 
not endorse this argument against 
the relevance of objective truth, 
he does not in his essay explain 
what is wrong with the argument. 
To be fair to Lynch, he’s more 
concerned with arguing in favor 
of intellectual humility and an 
openness to evidence.
^
^ However, it is a shame that he 
doesn’t debunk the argument against 
objective truth. It’s one that seems to 
be very appealing to many people, 
perhaps because they associate 
the notion of objective truth with 
dogmatism or close-mindedness. That 
association, however, is a mistake. 
In fact, the idea that it’s possible 
that we could be very confident and 
believe ourselves to have very good 
evidence but nevertheless be mistaken 
about the truth is the opposite of 
dogmatism. But that possibility 
is exactly what objective truth 
guarantees! So, arguing for the notion 
of objective truth serves Lynch’s 
broader goal of making the case for 
intellectual humility.
^
^ The quote from Lynch contains two 
arguments:
]
] One argument begins with the 
idea that we always only have 
access to information from our 
own subjective impressions and 
concludes with the claim that 
objective truth doesn’t exist. Let’s 
call this the inexistence argument.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 2  Knowledge, Truth, and Belief

15
]
] The other argument also begins with 
the idea that we always only have 
access to information from our own 
subjective impressions but concludes 
with the claim that we’ll never know 
objective truth. Let’s modify the 
conclusion of this argument slightly 
by making it that we’ll never grasp 
objective truth. This modification 
doesn’t really affect the point of 
the argument; it doesn’t seem to 
be an argument about knowledge. 
It’s really about truth and its 
inaccessibility, so let’s call this the 
inaccessibility argument.
^
^ The problem with the inexistence 
argument is that it involves a pretty 
obvious non sequitur, which is a fancy 
way of saying that the conclusion of 
the argument doesn’t follow from its 
premises. In this case, the glaring 
problem is that how we access 
information has no bearing on 
whether or not truth exists.
^
^ Suppose someone argues that, 
because architectural photography 
always only records information 
from the subjective impressions of the 
photographer, buildings don’t exist. 
This is ridiculous. But it’s exactly 
what the inexistence argument 
attempts to do in the case of truth.
^
^ So, the inexistence argument fails: 
There is no reason to think that 
objective truth does not exist, even 
if—for the sake of argument—we 
grant that we always only have access 
to our own subjective impressions.
^
^ We’ll allow, then, for at least the 
possibility that truth exists. For our 
purposes, we may characterize truth 
as involving a certain kind of state of 
affairs—for example, a state of affairs 
consisting of a claim and something 
the claim is about. And, to continue 
the example, what it is for a claim 
to be true is for what is claimed 
actually to be the case. So, the claim 
“Washington wintered at Valley 
Forge in 1777­–1778” is true so long 
as Washington really did winter at 
Valley Forge in 1777–1778.
^
^ What is a claim? It’s something that 
some individual person makes. There 
can’t be a claim without someone 
claiming it—even if that person is 
only claiming it, say, for the sake of 
argument. States of affairs, however, 
are not claims. They are ways that 
the world is. And, as such, they are 
independent of claims.
^
^ States of affairs, then, are objective 
and independent of anybody’s 
thoughts or claims. Claims, on the 
other hand, are subjective; they are 
acts—speech acts—that an individual 
person performs. So, what it means 
for something to be true always 
involves a subjective component. And 
what it means to grasp an objective 
truth is simply to endorse a claim that 
is true.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 2  Knowledge, Truth, and Belief

16
^
^ For our purposes right now, we can 
treat beliefs as on a par with claims; 
roughly, beliefs are claims that you 
endorse silently to yourself, or claims 
that you would endorse silently to 
yourself if they were brought to your 
attention, or claims that you would 
endorse publicly if they became a 
topic of interest.
^
^ So, if our argument shows that the 
subjectivity of claims is completely 
compatible with our ability to grasp 
objective truth, then the argument 
should equally show that the 
subjectivity of beliefs is completely 
compatible with our ability to grasp 
objective truth.
^
^ In other words, rather than its being 
incompatible with the subjectivity of 
belief that we grasp objective truth, 
our grasping objective truth always 
involves an aspect of subjectivity.
T
here are at least three distinct kinds of 
knowledge.
v
v Know-how is the knowledge that craftspeople have; 
they know how to pilot a ship or cure disease.
v
v Knowledge-wh—knowledge-who, -what, -where, or 
-why—is the knowledge that enables you to answer 
a who, what, when, where, or why question.
v
v Knowledge-that, or propositional knowledge, is 
knowledge that a certain fact is true.
Most philosophical discussions of knowledge have 
traditionally focused on propositional, or factual, 
knowledge—knowledge-that.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 2  Knowledge, Truth, and Belief

17
ARGUMENT FOR THE IRRELEVANCE OF TRUTH
^
^ This argument has been proposed in 
slightly different versions by a number 
of thinkers, but the version we’ll 
consider is that offered by philosopher 
Richard Rorty, who begins by noting 
that, whenever we ask ourselves 
whether some claim is true, we 
answer that question by looking at the 
evidence that we have for thinking 
that it is true. If that’s the case, he 
continues, then there is no way to 
determine truth independently of 
our evidence. So, he suggests, truth is 
irrelevant—all that we really ought to 
concern ourselves with is our evidence 
for endorsing a given claim.
^
^ There are reasons to question the 
premises of Rorty’s argument, but for 
now we don’t even need to do that. 
This is because the biggest problem 
with Rorty’s argument is that it is a 
non sequitur. As with the inexistence 
argument, in Rorty’s argument the 
conclusion simply doesn’t follow from 
the premises.
^
^ We can see this most clearly by 
considering how Rorty is thinking 
of truth for his argument to work. 
In order for the argument to work, 
the only use of truth can be when 
we ask ourselves whether something 
is true. But this is not the only use. 
Sometimes you want to know not 
whether you think something is true, 
but whether someone else thinks 
something is true.
^
^ Once you consider those sorts of 
cases, it’s obvious that grasping the 
truth and having evidence for the 
truth can come apart—in either 
direction. In other words, sometimes 
you can tell that someone happened 
upon the truth but believes it on 
the basis of not very good evidence; 
other times you can see that someone 
thinks he or she has good evidence 
that something is true, but you can 
tell that it isn’t true. So, Rorty’s 
argument for the irrelevance of truth 
fails as well.

Foundationalism: 
Descartes’s 
Evil Demon
I
n 1619, René Descartes experienced a revelation that 
caused him to seek to find a way to discover a “universal 
method for the discovery of truth.” The method that he 
propounded is considered by many scholars—and many 
of the thinkers who came after Descartes—to be the 
beginning of modern philosophy. Descartes compares 
the sciences as they have traditionally been practiced 
to a building erected on a shaky foundation. Just as we 
wouldn’t continue to renovate and improve a building 
that we knew to have a shaky foundation, Descartes 
suggests that we shouldn’t continue to increase the store 
of our scientific knowledge until we have shored up 
its foundation.

20
THE EVIL DEMON ARGUMENT
^
^ One way to think about the 
“universal method” that Descartes 
discovered is the way that Descartes 
himself later argued for the 
implementation of his method, which 
has come to be known as the evil 
demon argument.
^
^ Descartes begins by noting that often, 
in dreams, we experience things that 
aren’t real. Within dreams, however, 
we believe that the things we are 
dreaming are real. Of course, even 
in dreams we might still be said to 
know very general facts about the 
world—for example, that the earth 
revolves around the sun or that fire 
is hot. If his goal is to find a way to 
find a new basis for all of the sciences, 
then, Descartes knew that he would 
need a way to tear down the entire 
edifice of knowledge so that he could 
rebuild it from the ground up using 
his new method.
^
^ To do this, Descartes asks us to 
imagine a very powerful demon, 
one so powerful that he can not only 
make us experience things that aren’t 
there, as we do in particularly vivid 
dreams, but also to believe things that 
aren’t true—even that 2 + 2 = 5, for 
example.
^
^ If we imagine that we are in the 
clutches of such a powerful demon, 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 3  Foundationalism: Descartes’s Evil Demon

21
^
^ This is the origin of Descartes’s well-
known assertion Cogito ergo sum: “I 
think, therefore I am.” Even if the 
demon can deceive you about the 
content of your beliefs, he cannot 
deceive you about the fact that he 
is now causing you to doubt those 
beliefs. If you are doubting, then you 
are thinking. If you are thinking, 
then you exist. Using Descartes’s new 
method, we have now established 
definitively the fact of our own 
existence upon the firmest of all 
possible foundations.
INTERNALISM AND DUALISM
^
^ As the great logician, philosopher, 
peace activist, and Nobel Prize 
winner Bertrand Russell writes 
regarding Descartes, 
b
bThere is thus, in all philosophy 
derived from Descartes, a tendency 
to subjectivism, and to regarding 
matter as something only knowable, 
if at all, by inference from what is 
known of the mind.
^
^ As this quote from Russell’s A History 
of Western Philosophy illustrates, 
Descartes’s theory of knowledge is 
characterized by two components: 
what Russell terms “subjectivism” 
regarding the source of the beliefs 
that serve as the foundations of 
knowledge and how all of the other 
knowledge that we have derives 
from the foundations by means of 
inference. This lecture will focus on 
the first component, while the next 
lecture will focus on the second.
^
^ Philosophers since Russell would 
quibble with the use of the term 
“subjectivism” to characterize 
Descartes’s position. Instead, 
contemporary usage would 
characterize Descartes as an 
internalist, because according 
to Descartes, all of the evidence 
upon which we build our edifice 
of knowledge is internal to 
the mind of the knower.
^
^ At the core of Descartes’s method is 
a focus on what you are experiencing 
right now, in the moment. In other 
words, Descartes’s method builds the 
foundation for all knowledge out of 
the states of your mind at the given 
instant in which you are experiencing 
those states—what philosophers call 
occurrent mental states, because 
the states are only experienced 
as they are occurring. So, what 
Descartes is really saying is that all 
of our knowledge ultimately rests on 
our occurrent mental states for its 
foundation and that these occurrent 
mental states are more certain for us 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 3  Foundationalism: Descartes’s Evil Demon

22
than any other information about 
which we might form beliefs.
^
^ It is important to stress that the sort 
of evidence available to the internalist 
like Descartes is what is present to the 
mind—not what occurs in the brain.
^
^ As Descartes notes, a mind is a 
thinking thing, one that “doubts, 
understands, conceives, affirms, 
denies, wills, refuses, which also 
imagines and feels.” What the mind 
feels, however, is distinct from any 
information that, say, the human 
sense organs gather.
^
^ This is obviously true for Descartes 
himself. Descartes was what 
philosophers call a dualist, which 
means that he believed that minds 
and brains are two separate and 
distinct substances. In particular, 
Descartes believed that minds had 
no spatial location—though they did 
interact with the brain.
^
^ Few philosophers are Descartes-style 
dualists anymore. Many philosophers, 
however, still subscribe to internalism 
about the ultimate sources of 
knowledge.
S
trangely, Descartes thought that mind-brain 
interaction took place at the pineal gland, a small 
gland at the center 
of the brain, right 
between the two 
halves of the thalamus.
Scientists now know 
that the pineal gland 
produces melatonin, 
a hormone essential 
to maintain our sleep 
cycle, although in 
Descartes’s day, the 
true function of the 
pineal gland was 
unknown.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 3  Foundationalism: Descartes’s Evil Demon

23
^
^ Let’s suppose that contemporary 
internalists agree with Descartes that 
the foundational evidence on which 
all knowledge rests concerns occurrent 
mental states and that they disagree 
with Descartes about the separation 
of mind and body. So, let’s say that 
they either think that the mind just is 
some part of the body—some part of 
the brain, perhaps—or that the mind 
is the result of the operation of some 
part or parts of the body.
^
^ Clearly, what constitutes the mind 
doesn’t necessarily involve all of the 
body. A limited number of parts of 
the brain make up the mind.
^
^ Contemporary theories of knowledge 
that embrace internalism—even 
those that don’t follow Descartes 
in radically separating mind from 
body—still must limit the sources of 
evidence. Those sources that serve as 
the foundations of knowledge for the 
internalist will be limited to occurrent 
mental states that are at best a very 
small subset of the larger number of 
states of the brain, central nervous 
system, or peripheral nervous system.
^
^ Descartes’s view of knowledge 
requires that our occurrent mental 
states be the most certain type of 
knowledge that we can have. This is 
something we can test: Is it plausible 
that our knowledge of our occurrent 
mental states reaches the level of 
certainty that Descartes’s theory 
requires?
^
^ There are a number of different 
types of occurrent mental states. 
Descartes himself speaks of doubting, 
understanding, conceiving, affirming, 
denying, willing, refusing, imagining, 
and feeling. It isn’t very plausible that 
our knowledge of all of these mental 
states will be equally certain.
^
^ For now, let’s give Descartes the benefit 
of the doubt and focus on the most 
promising case for certain knowledge 
of occurrent mental states: feelings—in 
particular, the feeling of having a 
certain visual sensory experience.
^
^ Phenomena from vision science—
such as foveal vision, saccades, 
change blindness, and inattentional 
blindness—demonstrate that if we 
were forced to rely on our awareness 
of our occurrent visual experiences, 
we would be in trouble. These and 
other phenomena demonstrate that 
in the case of vision, we have very 
little awareness of the quality of our 
occurrent visual experiences.
^
^ If this is true of vision, then there 
is little hope of Descartes’s strategy 
working for other forms of sensory 
awareness either. For most people, 
visual experiences are our most vivid 
and rich. If, as the evidence shows, 
we are misled about the extent of 
our awareness of visual experience, 
this does not suggest that we should 
be optimistic about our awareness of 
the phenomenal qualities of sounds, 
smells, tastes, or touches.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 3  Foundationalism: Descartes’s Evil Demon

24
R
easons for skepticism about the certainty of our awareness of 
occurrent sensory experiences come from the field of vision study.
You’ve probably heard of peripheral vision, but you may not have 
heard of its complement: foveal vision. The fovea is a small region of 
very tightly packed cones, the cells responsible for color and shape 
detection in the eye. Almost half of all the information that reaches 
the brain comes from this one region, and only the part of the scene 
captured by foveal vision is seen with any detail.
We’re unaware of this, of course. 
When we think about our visual 
experience, it seems to us as if 
we see an entire scene in rich 
detail. This is because our eyes 
are constantly moving, even when 
we’re examining a still image. These 
movements, called saccades, are 
extremely fast. They allow our brain 
to gather detailed information 
about different parts of the visual 
scene as our foveal vision scans 
it for interesting features, all of 
which occurs without our conscious 
awareness or control.
The area captured by foveal vision is extremely small—the width of one 
thumbnail when viewed at arm’s length. So, the detailed visual scenes 
that we seem to experience are actually composed of a number of 
these thumbnail-sized images captured by our eyes, which constantly 
move, or saccade, to take in different areas of the visual scene. Our 
brains then piece these together to form a larger whole.
In the case of change blindness, there are many features of the visual 
scene that, despite being evident, go unregistered from moment to 
moment—even features as obvious as the person you’re talking to.
The phenomenon of inattentional blindness demonstrates one potential 
cause of this lack of sensitivity to features of the visual scene: We fail to 
register features of our experience that we’re not paying attention to.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 3  Foundationalism: Descartes’s Evil Demon

25
^
^ If you think about this even briefly, it 
should be no surprise that this is the 
case. If you reject Cartesian mind-
body dualism, then presumably you 
think that the existence of mind has 
an evolutionary explanation: Minds 
have survived as an evolved trait in 
humans either because having minds 
confers an evolutionary advantage or 
because having minds is a by-product 
of some other trait that confers an 
evolutionary advantage.
^
^ In either case, it seems doubtful that 
being highly attuned to one’s internal, 
subjective phenomenology would 
confer an evolutionary advantage. 
Imagine the caveman so captivated 
by the experience of color that 
he gets from gazing at a tropical 
flower that he is promptly 
eaten by the tiger he’s failed to 
observe.
^
^ Rather, what would confer an 
evolutionary advantage would 
be the ability to keep the world 
in mind: to pay attention not 
to your subjective experience, 
but to significant features of 
your environment. And though 
these phenomena from cognitive 
psychology call into question 
how well we pay attention to the 
qualitative features of our subjective 
consciousness, they don’t call into 
question our ability to track features 
of our environment that we find 
significant.
^
^ Of course, this is still bad news for 
Descartes’s internalism. Descartes 
wanted to establish the entire edifice 
of knowledge on what he took to be 
our certain awareness of our own 
internal mental states. And what 
we’ve discovered so far suggests that 
our knowledge of those internal 
mental states is far from certain.

The Coherence 
Theory of Knowledge
W
here Descartes suggested that all knowledge 
should be built up on secure foundations, his 
19th-century opponents, along with their 20th-
century descendants, rejected the idea that such 
foundations were possible—or necessary. In the 
place of such foundations, these opponents of 
Descartes’s foundationalism suggested that the 
route to knowledge involves the way beliefs come 
together to form a system in which reasons are 
interconnected and mutually supporting. The idea 
was that knowledge has to do with the way beliefs 
cohere with each other. For this reason, this theory 
came to be known as coherentism.

28
INFALLIBILISM VERSUS FALLIBILISM
^
^ The first problem that Descartes’s 
successors raised for his theory 
of knowledge was his view that 
all knowledge must be certain 
knowledge. Descartes thought that 
this was true for two reasons.
]
] He thought that the foundations of 
knowledge were facts that we could 
know with certainty. The paradigm 
example of this is the fact that you 
are now thinking. There is no way 
you can be mistaken about that 
fact at the very moment you are 
thinking it.
]
] He thought that we build up our 
knowledge on our foundational 
beliefs by means of deductive 
reasoning.
^
^ Deductive reasoning, however, 
is certain: If the premises of a 
deductive argument are true, then the 
conclusions arrived at on the basis of 
those premises must be true as well. 
This means that if we have certain 
foundations and further beliefs built 
up on those certain foundations by 
means of deductive reasoning, then 
we have certainty all up and down 
the edifice of knowledge! Because of 
this, Descartes’s view is considered to 
be a version of infallibilism, the view 
that knowledge must be known with 
certainty.
^
^ The problem with this is that it 
provides us with a very limited 
picture of the extent of knowledge. If 
knowledge requires certainty, then 
almost none of the facts that we take 
ourselves to know are facts that we 
actually know.
^
^ For most philosophers, this seems like 
too drastic a step to take. This is why 
most philosophers—including almost 
all contemporary philosophers who 
study knowledge—are fallibilists. 
This means that they think that your 
knowing a fact is compatible with its 
being possible that you are wrong 
about that fact.
^
^ Of course, because knowing 
something requires that what you 
know is true, knowing a fact isn’t 
compatible with the fact’s actually 
being wrong. It’s just compatible with 
the possibility that the way you know 
the fact doesn’t guarantee the truth of 
that fact with certainty.
^
^ Many philosophers were convinced 
that Descartes’s commitment to 
infallibilism was wrong. A number 
of them thought the answer was 
simply to abandon infallibilism 
but still maintain a commitment to 
Descartes’s foundationalism. On 
this view, our knowledge requires 
foundations, but the way we build up 
our knowledge on those foundations 
doesn’t guarantee certain truth.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 4  The Coherence Theory of Knowledge

29
^
^ Many philosophers, however, 
were distrustful of the idea that 
we could make sense of building 
up all knowledge on the basis of 
foundational beliefs. Because of this 
distrust, these philosophers rejected 
that the structure of knowledge ought 
to be thought of as a building, with 
the higher-level beliefs supported 
by the beliefs on the levels below. 
Instead, they suggested that we think 
of the structure of knowledge like a 
web—where each node of a web is 
mutually supporting and any tear in 
the web, at any point, can cause the 
whole structure to fail.
P
hilosophers who were distrustful of the idea 
that we could make sense of building up all 
knowledge on the basis of foundational beliefs 
noted, for example, that much of our perceptual 
knowledge is dependent on the other beliefs 
we have.
Without a knowledge of tools and 
their functions, for example, you 
wouldn’t know that a piece of wood 
connected in a T shape to a piece of 
metal is a hammer. With that knowledge of 
tools and their functions, on the other hand, 
you immediately see a hammer and not a mere 
piece of metal and wood.
^
^ These philosophers—such as 
Willard Van Orman Quine, Donald 
Davidson, and Keith Lehrer—
suggested that this weblike, mutually 
supporting structure of knowledge 
could be understood in terms of the 
notion of coherence. The view 
that the structure of knowledge 
should be understood in this way 
is known as the coherence theory, 
or coherentism.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 4  The Coherence Theory of Knowledge

30
COHERENTISM
^
^ In one sense, the intuition behind 
coherentism is unquestionable. If 
one’s beliefs are going to count as 
knowledge, it would seem that they 
must, at the very least, be consistent. 
And presumably coherence must, at 
the very least, include consistency.
^
^ Think about the ways in which we 
provide positive arguments to others 
in favor of our theories: We do so on 
the basis of other characteristics of 
those theories that philosophers have 
counted as part of coherence. These 
include properties of theories such as 
predictive and explanatory power and 
simplicity.
^
^ This gives us, then, at least four 
properties that belong to coherence: 
consistency, predictive power, 
explanatory power, and simplicity.
]
] At a minimum, you would assume 
that a defensible belief would 
have to be consistent with the 
other beliefs that you have. You 
can’t believe that it’s snowing, for 
example, unless you also believe 
that it’s cold enough to snow.
]
] Of course, just having a consistent 
set of beliefs is a fairly weak 
standard to satisfy. This is where 
the other conditions come in. 
If you have a consistent set of 
beliefs that also does a good job of 
explaining the world, then that’s 
even better. This is the point of 
including explanatory power as a 
requirement for coherence.
]
] Even consistency and explanatory 
power, however, are too weak. 
Consider the example of ancient 
Greek mythology. The myths 
that the ancient Greeks told were 
consistent. Furthermore, they 
provided an explanation for the 
phenomena that they observed 
around them. If it thundered, it 
was because a particular god was 
angry. The problem, however, is 
that ancient Greek mythology is not 
very useful in making predictions. 
]
] Although explanations from Greek 
mythology might help explain 
why a certain event occurred, it 
wouldn’t be very good in foretelling 
what events have yet to occur. 
Although Zeus’s anger might be a 
good after-the-fact explanation for 
a thunderstorm, it is more useful to 
measure current temperature, wind 
direction, barometric pressure, 
and humidity if you’re interested in 
forecasting what the weather will 
be like in the next few hours. In 
other words, a theory of weather 
that takes such facts into account 
will have greater predictive power 
than Greek mythology.
]
] You might sometimes have two 
theories that are on equal footing 
with respect to their consistency, 
explanatory power, and predictive 
power. When that occurs, you

Lecture 4  The Coherence Theory of Knowledge

31
should choose the simpler of the 
two theories. You may have heard 
an expression that characterizes 
the intuition behind including 
simplicity as a criterion: “When 
hearing hoofbeats, think horses, 
not zebras.”
^
^ There are two small issues plaguing 
coherence theory. Neither of these 
issues by itself is devastating for 
coherence theory. They show that 
the theory needs work, but they don’t 
show that it’s unworkable.
]
] The first problem for coherence 
theory is that the theory requires 
that you have consistent beliefs 
in order to have knowledge. The 
problem here is that nobody 
actually has completely consistent 
beliefs. In fact, it’s common 
for people to hold inconsistent 
sets of beliefs, and if we require 
consistency for coherence—and 
coherence for knowledge—then 
we’d have the undesired result 
that nobody knows anything. 
Presumably, however, there may be 
some way to weaken the consistency 
requirement. What the coherence 
theorist would have to do is find 
some way to require a certain 
level of consistency but not perfect 
consistency. The first problem, 
then, says that the requirements of 
coherence theory are too strong.
P
erhaps you believe that a politician that you 
admire is a good person, that nobody who 
cheats on his or her spouse is a good person, and 
that the politician you admire cheated on his or her 
spouse. That’s an inconsistent set of beliefs.
]
] The second problem says that 
they’re unclear. Due to the 
notion that coherence involves 
the four criteria of consistency, 
explanatoriness, predictive 
power, and simplicity, there will 
be different ways to weigh the 
four criteria that will result in 
different theories. But in the case 
of knowledge, our theory should 
give us the one correct theory—and 
it’s hard to see, given the fact that 
we can weigh the components of 
coherence differently, how we can 
do that with coherence theory.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 4  The Coherence Theory of Knowledge

32
^
^ There are three arguments against 
coherence theory that raise serious 
difficulties for it: the problem of 
surprising evidence, the problem of 
experience, and the problem of truth.
]
] For the coherentist, what makes 
one of your beliefs well supported 
enough to be a candidate for 
knowledge is for that belief to 
cohere with the other beliefs that 
you already have. One challenge 
for the view, then, is what to do 
about surprising beliefs. What it 
means to be a surprising belief 
is precisely that it doesn’t fit well 
with the other beliefs that you 
already have. 
]
] The way to make sense of a 
surprising belief in a way that fits 
with coherence theory would be 
to explain away the belief so that 
it isn’t surprising. The problem 
for the coherence theory, then, is 
that it suggests we should dismiss 
or explain away surprising 
experiences or evidence. As many 
cases from the history of science 
and technology demonstrate, 
this is often precisely the wrong 
attitude to take. We should embrace 
the surprising evidence. New 
discoveries and the development 
of new theories depend on our 
working on coming up with new 
explanations to make sense of the 
evidence that surprised us. 
]
] So, the problem of surprising 
evidence for coherence theory is 
that there’s no room for unexpected 
evidence in a theory that makes 
coherence with existing beliefs 
the standard for knowledge. 
The problem, then, focuses 
on the coherence criterion for 
coherence theory.
]
] The problem of experience targets 
a different aspect of the coherence 
theory. This problem has to do 
with the fact that the only elements 
that coherence theory evaluates are 
beliefs. According to the problem 
of experience, the exclusive focus 
on beliefs as the only source of 
evidence forces the coherence 
theorist to misunderstand the many 
cases in which it is experiences, 
rather than beliefs, that are the 
main source of evidence for 
knowledge.
]
] Even more serious is the problem of 
truth. According to this problem, 
even the most coherent system 
of beliefs can still fail to achieve 
truth. If this is correct, however, 
then coherence cannot be the 
property of beliefs that, in optimal 
conditions, results in knowledge. 
Coherence alone—even a very 
high degree of coherence—is not 
sufficient to ensure truth. Thus, the 
theory is unworkable: One can have 
a highly coherent theory and have 
beliefs that cohere extremely well 
with that theory, but those beliefs 
can still be false.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 4  The Coherence Theory of Knowledge

33
S
urprisingly, one of the clearest statements 
of the problem of truth was offered by a 
defender of coherence theory, the early 20th-
century philosopher Brand Blanshard, who noted 
that the notion of coherence theory as a theory 
of justification stands in tension with a notion of 
objective truth.
Someone might hold that coherence with 
a set of beliefs is the test of truth but 
that truth consists in correspondence to 
objective facts. If, however, truth consists 
in correspondence to objective facts, 
coherence with a set of beliefs will not be a 
test of truth. This is the case since there is 
no guarantee that a perfectly coherent set 
of beliefs matches objective reality.
Blanshard thought that, if faced with the choice 
between coherence theory and an objective notion 
of truth, we would choose coherence theory. 
However, abandoning an objective notion of truth is 
not a good strategy to pursue. Instead, we should 
reject coherence theory.

Externalist Theories

O
ne of the ways in which philosophers attempted to 
deal with the difficulties faced by Descartes was to 
reject his foundationalism. The result was the theory 
of coherentism. However, coherentism faces its own 
challenges. There are two further challenges faced 
by both traditional foundationalist and coherentist 
theories that we have not yet considered. Thinking 
about these will help us formulate a new type 
of theory, one that wasn’t anticipated until the 
beginning of the 20th century.

36
CHALLENGES FOR FOUNDATIONALISM 
AND COHERENTISM
^
^ One of the further challenges for 
both traditional theories is that they 
ignore how a person’s beliefs are 
actually formed and sustained. In 
philosophical terms, both are theories 
of propositional justification. This 
means that they only look at purely 
logical relations between a person’s 
evidence and beliefs.
^
^ Modern philosophers generally 
accept that, in order for you to be 
justified in your belief, it’s not enough 
for you to have good evidence. 
Rather, your belief must be based 
on the good evidence that you have. 
The fact that you have that good 
evidence should explain why you hold 
the belief.
^
^ Many philosophers characterize 
this idea by saying that theories of 
knowledge must include a basing 
relation; that is, adequate theories 
must include an account of what it is 
for beliefs to be properly based on the 
evidence so as to count as knowledge.
^
^ Now consider the second 
problem facing both traditional 
foundationalism and coherentism. 
Both traditional foundationalism and 
coherentism are usually considered 
fallibilist theories in modern times. 
This means that they hold that you 
can know some fact even without 
certain evidence; that is, they say 
that you can know that fact even if 
your evidence doesn’t give you an 
absolutely certain guarantee that 
it’s true. This leaves these theories 
open to the challenge of so-called 
Gettier cases, named for philosopher 
Edmund Gettier.
^
^ There are versions of both 
coherentism and traditional 
foundationalism that attempt to give 
an account of the basing relation and 
solve the Gettier problem. However, 
a new class of theories of knowledge 
emerged in the 20th century that 
offer an elegant way of achieving both 
of these goals at the same time. These 
are known as externalist theories.
PROCESS RELIABILISM
^
^ There are now many versions 
of externalist theories. One of 
the simplest—known as process 
reliabilism—is both representative of 
the main features of externalist views 
and is capable of explaining many of 
the features of knowledge that we seek 
to explain.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 5  Externalist Theories of Knowledge

37
A 
simple version of a Gettier case comes from 
Bertrand Russell:
v
v Suppose you’re rushing to 
a meeting at noon in an 
unfamiliar building. You 
check the time on the clock 
in the hallway and it reads 
11:55, so you believe that 
you have five minutes to get 
to the meeting location.
v
v Unbeknownst to you, however, the clock has 
stopped working hours before. Famously, though, 
even a stopped clock is right twice a day, and it just 
so happens that this clock stopped working exactly 
12 hours ago, at 11:55 pm.
Here’s the problem: You believe it’s 11:55. It’s 
true that it’s 11:55. Your evidence for your belief 
is that the clock says it’s 11:55, and for all you 
know, you have no reason to suspect that the 
clock isn’t working. You’re even basing your belief 
appropriately on your evidence.
Most philosophers, however, agree that you don’t 
have knowledge in this case, because it’s purely an 
accident that your evidence points you toward the 
truth. Had you looked at the clock a few minutes 
earlier or later, it would still have read 11:55 and your 
belief would be mistaken.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 5  Externalist Theories of Knowledge

38
^
^ One of the earliest statements of 
process reliabilism can be found 
in the work of mathematician 
F. P. Ramsey, who wrote in a 
1929 paper, 
b
bI have always said that a belief 
was knowledge if it was (i) true, 
(ii) certain, and (iii) obtained by a 
reliable process. 
^
^ With the exception of the inclusion 
of what Ramsey terms “certainty,” 
this account of knowledge is very 
similar to ones that we would 
encounter today.
^
^ If we reformulate the account to make 
it compatible with fallibilism, we’re 
left with this: Knowledge is true belief 
on the basis of a reliable process. 
Here, the term “reliable” roughly 
means “consistent.” And a “reliable 
process” is a process that reliably 
results in true beliefs.
P
sychologists use the term “reliability” roughly to 
mean “consistency.” In psychology, a measure is 
reliable if, given the same inputs, it’ll yield the same 
outputs.
For psychologists, then, something could be reliable 
but wrong—as long as it’s wrong consistently. For 
example, if your watch is running well but is set 23 
minutes fast, then your watch is reliable, despite not 
being accurate.
When psychologists talk about the accuracy of 
a measure, they use the term “validity.” So, for a 
psychologist, the best measures would be those that 
are both reliable and valid.
It’s this that philosophers are aiming at with the 
notion of “reliable process.”
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 5  Externalist Theories of Knowledge

39
^
^ It’s obvious how the process 
reliabilist theory can answer the 
first challenge—the challenge of 
explaining the basing relation. 
According to the process reliabilist, 
knowledge is true belief formed on the 
basis of a reliable process, a process 
that reliably yields true beliefs. And 
the answer to the question of how 
to determine the basing relation is 
baked right into the reliabilist theory: 
A belief that counts as knowledge 
will be appropriately based on the 
grounds that justify it because what it 
is for a belief to be justified is precisely 
to be caused by a process that reliably 
yields true beliefs.
^
^ With regard to the second 
challenge—that of the Gettier cases—
we need to consider the notion of 
“reliable process.” Note that in order 
to think about reliability accurately, 
we’ll have to suppose that we’re 
considering a process to be reliable 
with respect to a certain environment. 
This is important, because processes 
that are reliable with respect to one 
environment may not be reliable with 
respect to a different environment.
^
^ Consider a car whose engine is 
designed to function properly on 
generally well-paved roads in an 
industrialized nation. In a different 
environment—for example, in a 
desert with few roads—the engine 
might clog and become useless. 
The fact that the car’s engine 
doesn’t function reliably in desert 
environments does not mean that it 
isn’t reliable, but rather that it’s only 
reliable in the environments for which 
it was designed to function.
^
^ So, our account of knowledge in 
terms of reliable processes would 
have to include a reference to the 
environment as well. We could, more 
properly, say something like this: 
Knowledge is true belief based on a 
process that is reliable (in the sort of 
environment in which that belief was 
produced).
^
^ The challenge is to come up with an 
account of justified true belief that 
explains why Gettier cases—such as 
the stopped clock—are not cases of 
knowledge. And the process reliabilist 
theory allows us to do just this.
^
^ Even though we have a true belief 
in the clock case, we don’t have 
knowledge. The reason for this is 
that the process we’ve used—looking 
at a clock in the vicinity and relying 
on the information it conveys—is 
unreliable in an environment where 
the clock in the vicinity has stopped.
^
^ For the process reliabilist, someone 
who believes on the basis of an 
unreliable process is not justified. We 
have a true belief, but no justification. 
And without justification, there is no 
knowledge. So, the process reliabilist 
can explain why Gettier cases aren’t 
cases of knowledge.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 5  Externalist Theories of Knowledge

40
E
xternalism, represented by process reliabilism, 
seems to enjoy two advantages over traditional 
foundationalism and coherentism. Unlike those 
theories, the process reliabilist has a simple answer 
to the challenges posed both by the basing relation 
and by Gettier cases.
EXTERNALIST VERSUS INTERNALIST THEORIES
^
^ Despite the fact that they are 
rival views, foundationalism and 
coherentism have two key features 
in common.
]
] The first feature is that what counts 
as support for beliefs are states that 
are internal to the believer. In the 
case of coherentism, the supports 
for your beliefs are just other beliefs 
and the way that the totality of 
your beliefs fit together to form 
a coherent whole. In the case of 
foundationalism, the support for 
your beliefs would include beliefs, 
but also your experiences, as well as 
the logic-based and content-based 
relations that connect them. The 
relations of logic would characterize 
the ways in which beliefs might be 
logically or inductively supported 
by other beliefs. The relations of 
content would characterize the ways 
in which your experiences support 
your beliefs.
]
] Both theories can only conceive of 
the sorts of relations that provide 
support for beliefs in terms of 
logical, conceptual, or explanatory 
relations. This, then, is the second 
feature shared by both views. The 
ways that beliefs are supported 
are the sorts of ways that make 
sense upon reflection: deductive 
and inductive logic, conceptual 
connection, or coherence.
^
^ Think of the justification that leads 
to knowledge as a process governed 
by two types of rules. The first 
type of rule—let’s call them input 
rules—tells you what kinds of inputs 
you can introduce into the process. 
The second type of rule—let’s call 
them transition rules—tells you 
what you can do to the inputs or to 
other intermediate results within the 
process. The output of the process 
will be justified beliefs.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 5  Externalist Theories of Knowledge

41
^
^ With this way of thinking, we can 
characterize traditional coherentism 
as the view of justification that 
involves one type of input—beliefs—
and one type of transition rule—
coherence formation, however 
coherence theorists are able to make 
sense of that notion. Traditional 
foundationalism will have more 
inputs—beliefs, but also experiences 
of various types—and more transition 
rules—deductive inference, inference 
based on probability, and perhaps 
various other types of inference.
^
^ The inputs may include not just the 
variety of inputs that the traditional 
foundationalist allows, but also 
nonmental states. The transition 
rules can also be broader than 
either coherentism or traditional 
foundationalism includes. They can 
encompass the sorts of transitions 
that foundationalists and coherentists 
describe—just as long as those 
transitions are in fact reliable 
processes in the environments where 
they’re deployed—but they can also 
include additional reliable processes 
not countenanced by the coherentist 
or foundationalist.
^
^ The input rules involved in both 
coherentism and foundationalism 
limit the inputs to justification to 
states that are internal to your mind—
either beliefs alone or beliefs and 
other types of mental states, such as 
experiences. And the transition rules 
that coherentism and foundationalism 
allow are supposed to be the sorts of 
rules that you can recognize, simply 
through reflection, to be the sorts 
of rules that promote the discovery 
of truth.
^
^ In contrast, the input rules in process 
reliabilism allow for states of your 
brain and nervous system, other states 
of your body, or even states of the 
world outside of your body potentially 
to serve as inputs to the processes that 
result in justified beliefs.
I
n the case of tax 
software, there are 
two kinds of inputs: 
one for the type of 
entry and the other for 
some number amount. 
The transition rules are 
the rules governing 
what effect those 
types of entries and 
number amounts have 
on the tax you must 
pay, and the output of 
the process is your tax 
owed or tax refund.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 5  Externalist Theories of Knowledge

42
^
^ And as for the transition rules, 
process reliabilism allows for the 
possibility that there might be reliable 
processes leading to the formation of 
justified beliefs that we cannot know 
in advance, through reflection alone; 
that is, for the process reliabilist, 
empirical research into the processes 
that humans (or nonhuman animals) 
use to discover true information 
about the world will be relevant in 
determining whether a certain way 
of forming beliefs should count as 
justification or not.
^
^ This means that traditional 
foundationalism and coherentism 
are internalist because they stipulate 
that the basis for your beliefs must be 
internal to your mind and that the 
way your beliefs are justified must be 
something you can recognize, purely 
on the basis of reflection, as being a 
legitimate source of justification.
^
^ Process reliabilism is externalist 
both because it allows that at least 
part of the basis of your beliefs 
may include states outside of your 
mind and because it allows for the 
possibility that you might not be able 
to recognize, on the basis of pure 
reflection alone, why the actual basis 
for your beliefs is in fact a legitimate 
source of justification.
C
onsider again that you see the clock read 11:55 
and form the belief that you have five minutes 
to get to your meeting. Remember, the clock has 
stopped, though you don’t know that it has stopped.
According to both the 
foundationalist and the 
coherentist, you are justified 
in this case. According to 
the process reliabilist, you 
are not.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 5  Externalist Theories of Knowledge

43
^
^ The advantage for process reliabilists 
is that they have a very simple 
explanation for why the Gettier case 
is not a case of knowledge: Although 
you, looking at the stopped clock, 
have a true belief in the case where 
the clock happens to be right, you 
don’t know because you are not 
justified.
^
^ The foundationalist and coherentist 
must give a more complicated 
explanation for why Gettier cases 
don’t amount to knowledge. They’ve 
offered various explanations, all of 
which involve adding conditions to 
the analysis of knowledge. Rather 
than saying that knowledge is justified 
true belief and then explaining 
that justification is understood in 
terms of either foundationalism 
or coherentism, they must add an 
additional condition that explicitly 
rules out Gettier cases.

Problems with 
Self-Knowledge
I
n traditional epistemology, self-knowledge is the 
most important form of knowledge. The “self” in self-
knowledge refers to your mind—the states of your mind 
(the thoughts, feelings, emotions, and experiences) 
that Descartes wrote about as being the content of 
your mind. When they talk about self-knowledge, the 
epistemologists who think we have special knowledge 
of our own minds might be referring to transparency, 
which is the idea that your mind is transparent to you—
that whatever is part of the content of your mind, you 
can know that it’s part of the content of your mind. Or 
they might be referring to the infallibility thesis, which 
means that you’re never wrong about the mental states 
you have.

T
ransparency is 
the claim that 
if your mind 
contains mental 
state M, then you 
know that your 
mind contains 
mental state M.
Infallibility says that 
if you believe your 
mind contains mental 
state M, then your 
mind does contain 
mental state M.
46
TRANSPARENCY VERSUS INFALLIBILITY
^
^ Because, according to coherentism, 
the only way for a belief to be justified 
is to be part of a set of coherent 
beliefs, the coherentist will certainly 
not endorse infallibility about the 
beliefs we form about our mental 
states. However, at least for internalist 
coherentism, the transparency thesis 
is very important.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 6  Problems with Self-Knowledge

47
W
hen we talk about internalist coherentism, the 
“coherentism” part just refers to the fact that 
coherentists stress the importance of the coherence 
of your beliefs for your justification. Beliefs aren’t 
justified individually but are justified by being 
members of sets of beliefs that cohere together, are 
useful in providing explanations and predictions, and 
are the simplest sets of beliefs that provide useful 
explanations and predictions.
The “internalist” part means two things.
v
v The bases for your justification are internal to your 
mind: They’re mental states of yours. In the case of 
coherentism, they’re beliefs.
v
v The ways you build up your justification are 
ways you can appreciate as contributing to your 
justification. In the case of coherentism, you can 
come to appreciate that you are justified, because 
you can, if you check, establish to your own 
satisfaction that your beliefs are in fact members 
of a coherent set of beliefs that is comparatively 
simple, explanatory, and useful for predictions.
If the coherentist is an internalist, then he or she 
thinks that to be justified you need to be able to 
check to see that your beliefs are part of a coherent 
set that is comparatively simple, explanatory, and 
useful for predictions. But that means that you need 
to have knowledge of what your beliefs are—you 
have to know what you believe.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 6  Problems with Self-Knowledge

48
^
^ For any belief, if you believe it, then 
you know that you believe it—and this 
is just the transparency thesis applied 
to the case of beliefs. So, in order 
for coherence theory to work, the 
transparency thesis has to be true, at 
least in the case of beliefs.
^
^ The coherentist wants us to survey our 
beliefs and see how they hang together. 
The better they fit, the more justified 
they are. In some ways, then, the 
coherentist thinks that searching for 
justification is like trying to tell a good 
story. You’re looking for connections, 
trying to provide a picture that makes 
sense of all the component parts.
^
^ Storytelling is an activity. It 
requires work on the part of the 
storyteller, looking for connections 
and drawing parallels. In contrast, 
the foundationalist doesn’t think 
that our foundational justification 
requires much work on our part. In 
fact, the traditional foundationalist 
has a name for this foundational 
justification that makes the believer 
seem like just a passive recipient of his 
or her justification: the given, which 
refers to the sensory experiences that 
are just given to us when we engage 
with the world through our senses.
^
^ Because of this, the foundationalist 
doesn’t think that you need to survey 
your beliefs or other mental states in 
order to be justified in having those 
beliefs. When you’re justified on the 
basis of experience, that’s the most 
obvious thing in the world! Your sense 
experience, in such cases, just hands 
you your justification.
^
^ For an experience to be foundational, 
it must provide you with very strong 
evidence for some belief. The 
strongest evidence it could provide, 
the traditional foundationalist 
suggests, is for a belief that you’re 
having that sort of experience. And 
it’s that belief about your experience 
that justifies your belief.
^
^ But how much justification does your 
experience provide you for the belief 
that you’re having that experience? 
When you believe that you have a 
headache, for example, how justified 
are you?
^
^ If the infallibility claim is true, then 
if you believe you have a certain 
experience, then you really do have 
that experience. Your justification, 
in other words, is infallible. This is 
the sort of certain justification that 
Descartes was after.
^
^ Of course, the certainty stops for 
you at your beliefs about your 
experiences. Those are certain, but 
what isn’t certain is whatever you 
might infer from those beliefs.
^
^ Regardless, however, what is certain 
is that the infallibility claim, at least 
with regard to our own phenomenal 
experiences, is of great significance 
for the traditional foundationalist. 
It is our supposed infallibility about 
our own experiences that provides 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 6  Problems with Self-Knowledge

49
the secure foundation on which the 
traditional foundationalist thinks we 
must build up the entire structure of 
our justification and knowledge.
^
^ An additional mental phenomenon to 
which the foundationalist might say 
we must have infallible access is the 
relations between our mental states 
and the more foundational states that 
support them. If you’re going to be an 
internalist foundationalist and suggest 
that all your knowledge is based on 
a foundation of experiences—and 
beliefs about those experiences—to 
which you have privileged access, 
then presumably you’ll also think that 
you have privileged access to the fact 
that your experiences support the 
beliefs about them.
THE TRANSPARENCY CLAIM
^
^ When thinking about the 
transparency claim, the first thing 
that we need to do is try to consider 
only those mental states for which 
the claim is even remotely plausible. 
It should be pretty obvious that 
there are many aspects of our mind 
that aren’t transparent to us at 
any given time. For example, your 
mind plausibly contains a whole 
host of memories that you’re not 
even considering—and if you’re not 
considering those memories, then 
you’re also not currently believing 
that you have those memories.
^
^ So, the transparency claim only 
applies to states of your mind that 
are occurring to you right now. For 
example, if you now have a headache, 
then that is a state that is occurring to 
you right now.
^
^ Let’s assume that we’re limiting the 
transparency claim to occurrent 
mental states, the states that are 
occurring to you right now. There 
is one further way that we can limit 
the transparency claim. Because the 
claim is important for coherentism 
but not for foundationalism, and 
because coherentists only care 
about the transparency claim with 
respect to beliefs, we can limit our 
discussion to the question of whether 
it is plausible that our beliefs are 
transparent to us.
P
hilosophers call 
states of your mind 
that are occurring to 
you right now occurrent 
mental states. 
States that aren’t 
occurrent are called 
dispositional states.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 6  Problems with Self-Knowledge

50
^
^ In other words, is it plausible to 
suppose that whenever you are 
currently believing something you 
are aware that you are believing it? 
That is what the limited transparency 
claim amounts to.
^
^ Even if we limit the transparency 
claim in this way, it’s still not likely to 
be plausible. The following are two 
reasons for this:
]
] It’s common for people to believe 
the opposite of what they know to 
be true. The starkest example of 
this is the phenomenon of denial—
for example, when a cancer patient 
knows that he or she is facing death 
but refuses explicitly to admit it to 
him- or herself.
]
] There are plenty of beliefs that 
you’re unaware of at the moment 
at which you’re having them. 
An instant’s consideration would 
demonstrate that this is obvious. 
According to the transparency 
claim applied to occurrent beliefs, 
if you currently believe something, 
then you know that you believe it. 
Knowledge, however, is a form of 
belief. So, we would have to apply 
the transparency claim to that 
belief. So, if you currently know that 
you believe something, then you 
know you believe that you believe 
it—and so on. In other words, the 
transparency claim for beliefs 
means that any instant, you have an 
infinite number of occurrent beliefs. 
That’s not a very palatable result!
THE INFALLIBILITY CLAIM
^
^ There is good reason to doubt that 
your mental states—even the beliefs 
you’re having right now—are all 
transparent to you. But suppose 
you’re attending to an experience of 
yours and form a belief about it. Isn’t 
it plausible to suppose that any belief 
about an experience to which you’re 
now attending would have to be true? 
How could you be wrong in a belief 
about your own current experiences?
^
^ This is the intuition behind 
the internalist foundationalist 
endorsement of the infallibility claim, 
at least with respect to occurrent 
experiences. And the internalist 
foundationalist needs the infallibility 
claim to be true in order to argue 
that our current experiences form 
an infallible foundation on which to 
build up the rest of our knowledge.
^
^ Unfortunately for the internalist 
foundationalist, however, there 
are good reasons to question the 
infallibility claim, even when applied 
to our current experiences. Two such 
reasons come from philosophical 
considerations and psychological 
studies.

The Philosophical Argument
^
^ Although the spectrum of color, 
from red to violet, is effectively 
continuous, humans’ ability 
to distinguish colors from one 
another is not. This means that if 
the range of colors is depicted as a 
gradient, observers will perceive 
two different colors that are 
sufficiently close to one another 
on the gradient as being the 
same color.
^
^ Consider three colors: The first 
color and the third color are as 
close as possible on the gradient 
while still being distinguishable, 
and the second color is halfway 
between the first color and the third 
color. Suppose that because the 
second color is so close to the first 
color, it’s indistinguishable from the 
first color. Similarly, because the 
second color is so close to the third 
color, it is also indistinguishable 
from the third color.
^
^ It would seem that the following 
things are true of you if you’re 
observing the three colors:
]
] You have the experience that 
color 1 is the same as color 2.
]
] You have the experience that 
color 2 is the same as color 3.
]
] You have the experience that 
color 1 is different from color 3.
^
^ So, experiencing two colors as 
being the same is not a transitive 
relation—one like identity in math, 
where if a = b and b = c, then a = c. 
But the problem is that sameness 
of color is a transitive relation. If 
color a is the same as color b and 
color b is the same as color c, then 
color a must be the same as color c.
^
^ One way to deal with this problem 
is to suggest that the properties 
of experiences are somehow 
indeterminate, so that even though 
transitivity applies to sameness 
of color, it doesn’t apply to 
experiences of sameness of color. 
But let’s focus on the other way to 
deal with the problem, which is to 
deny that beliefs about experiences 
are infallible. In other words, when 
you believe you’re experiencing 
two colors as the same, there’s no 
guarantee that this really is the 
content of your experience.

Does Sense 
Perception Support 
Knowledge?
O
ne of the most significant sources of our 
knowledge—and particularly our knowledge of the 
world—is sense perception. One of the oldest debates 
in philosophy involves the implications of our reliance 
on perception for our contact. Do the senses serve 
as an obstacle, standing between us and the world? 
This way of thinking about the role of the senses is 
misleading. Worse, this way of thinking is ultimately 
irrelevant to the question of whether—and how—the 
beliefs that we form on the basis of perception are 
justified. However, this way of thinking about the 
senses is common, even among scientists who study 
sense perception.

55
I
n Making Up the Mind: How the Brain Creates 
Our Mental World, noted British psychologist and 
neuroimaging pioneer Chris Frith explains:
Even if all our senses are intact and our brain 
is functioning normally, we do not have direct 
access to the physical world. It may feel as if 
we have direct access, but this is an illusion 
created by our brain.
INDIRECT PERCEPTUAL REALISM
^
^ In philosophy, the view that you only 
ever perceive the world indirectly is 
called indirect perceptual realism. 
It’s realism because the view doesn’t 
deny that there really are objects in 
the world that we’re perceiving; it just 
holds that whenever we perceive those 
objects in the world, it’s through the 
intermediary step of perceiving our 
experiences.
^
^ One further argument one might 
point to in order to support the idea 
that our senses create our mental 
world is this: Different animals have 
different perceptual abilities. For 
example, bats and dolphins use sonar 
to navigate and to locate and track 
prey. Given this, it’s not implausible 
to suppose that different animals have 
experiences that feel very different.
P
hilosopher Thomas Nagel has a 
celebrated essay entitled “What Is 
It like to Be a Bat?” in which he argues 
that the radically different way in which the 
bat takes in information about the world 
through sonar means that we humans actually 
have no way of knowing what it’s like to be a bat.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 7  Does Sense Perception Support Knowledge?

56
^
^ It’s easy, then, to appreciate the 
popularity of the view that the 
senses are an obstacle between us 
and the world—or, at the very least, 
to appreciate why you might see 
the senses as potentially unreliable 
informants. The problem with all of 
these arguments, however, is that they 
completely misrepresent what sense 
perception does.
^
^ The arguments all share two features: 
They suggest that what sense 
perception really gives us is a feeling 
or experience with a particular 
phenomenal quality and that this 
feeling or experience is what serves as 
evidence for some further belief about 
the world. But these phenomenal 
qualities are in our minds. They’re 
all feelings in the mind, even if they 
might seem to be located somewhere 
outside of our heads.
^
^ Furthermore, the arguments also 
suggest that, because the feeling 
or experience is obviously distinct 
from the world, this introduces 
the possibility that the feeling 
or experience could actually be 
misleading us about the true nature 
of the world. In fact, part of the way 
that our senses mislead us is precisely 
by making us think that what is in our 
heads is actually in the world.
^
^ The first of these features is more 
fundamental, then. It’s because what 
sense perception immediately gives 
us is an experience with its own 
particular phenomenal quality—and 
because this experience is distinct 
from the world beyond it—that there 
is the possibility that the experience 
could be misleading us about the true 
nature of the world.
^
^ So, the indirect perceptual realist 
picture of perception is one in which 
the primary function of the senses 
is to provide us with experiences 
with their own unique phenomenal 
qualities. Then, on the basis of these 
experiences, we infer the existence of 
objects in the world that correspond 
to those experiences or, at the very 
least, cause them.
^
^ There are two main problems with 
this picture of perception—problems 
so central that they make it difficult to 
see how the indirect perceptual realist 
picture could be at all plausible.
^
^ The first problem is that this picture 
of perception, according to which we 
infer the existence of objects in the 
world based on our sense experiences, 
doesn’t fit with our understanding 
of how the brain actually processes 
perceptual information.
^
^ There are many stages of perceptual 
information processing in the brain 
before that information reaches a 
stage at which it can plausibly be 
called an experience. By the time it 
reaches that stage, however, it is no 
longer the sort of purely phenomenal 
experience that the indirect 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 7  Does Sense Perception Support Knowledge?

57
perceptual realist is talking about. 
Instead, the sort of experience that 
results from those many earlier stages 
of brain processing already contains 
a great many assumptions about 
external world objects.
I
t’s hard to imagine a more phenomenal kind of 
experience than a pain experience. But even a 
pain experience cannot be understood as a pure 
phenomenon.
For one thing, you don’t experience a pain as being 
located somewhere in your mind. Rather, you 
experience a pain as located somewhere in physical 
space—it’s a headache or backache.
For another thing, even the way we 
describe the type of pain generally 
refers to the types of external 
world causes that lead to the 
pain. It’s a “stabbing” pain or a 
“pounding” pain.
This suggests that even with 
experiences as raw as 
pains, by the time your 
brain has processed the 
information that goes 
into the experience, the 
experience itself already 
contains a great deal of 
information.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 7  Does Sense Perception Support Knowledge?

58
^
^ This is obvious in the case of sense 
experience. For healthy perceivers, 
our visual experience, for example, 
comes to us with a great deal of 
information already processed and 
ready for use, no inference on our 
part required.
C
onsider the case of perceivers who are not healthy. 
Certain brain injuries, resulting from tumors or 
trauma, can affect centers of the brain responsible 
for processing visual information and categorizing it 
according to the objects it contains. People with damage 
to these areas are said to suffer from visual agnosia.
Here’s one of the scenarios that researchers who study 
visual agnosia have observed.
First, the researchers present the sufferers of agnosia 
with pictures of common objects, such as pens, and ask 
them to sketch what they see. They’re able to do so with 
no difficulty. Then, researchers ask them to label the 
objects that they’ve drawn. The agnosics are unable to 
do this.
Furthermore, if you ask agnosics to define those 
objects—”What are pens for?”—they are able to do that.
If perception simply involved inference, then this 
condition shouldn’t exist. Agnosics should easily be 
able to infer that the experiences they have correspond 
to these common, everyday objects and then to name 
those objects they see. Because they cannot do this, 
this suggests that the brain processes visual information 
prior to experience—so that healthy perceivers already 
enjoy experiences of the objects in their environment as 
experiences of those objects.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 7  Does Sense Perception Support Knowledge?

59
^
^ The second problem with indirect 
perceptual realism is that it sees the 
role of the senses as being able to 
provide us with phenomenal sensory 
experiences. But this is simply 
mistaken. Rather, the role of the senses 
is to provide us with information about 
the world around us.
^
^ These two problems may seem 
bad enough for indirect perceptual 
realism, but there is an even bigger 
problem for the view, at least from 
our perspective: According to 
indirect perceptual realism, all we 
immediately perceive is our own 
perceptual experiences, rather than 
the objects that those experiences are 
about. But that’s a claim about the 
immediate objects of our experiences.
^
^ The technical term for that subject 
matter is metaphysics—the study of 
the basic building blocks of reality 
and their relations to each other. 
That’s not what we’re primarily 
concerned with. We’re interested in 
knowledge and how to get it. So, we’re 
interested in the building blocks 
of knowledge, such as beliefs, and 
what makes some beliefs count as 
knowledge.
^
^ And the point now is that the 
beliefs we form on the basis of sense 
perception are not primarily beliefs 
about our experiences. They’re 
beliefs about phenomena in the world 
that we care about: people, places, 
and things.
^
^ But indirect perceptual realism is 
a theory about the objects of our 
perceptual experiences, not about 
the objects of the beliefs based on 
those experiences. So, even if indirect 
perceptual realism were true, that 
would have no direct bearing on the 
relation between sense perception and 
knowledge.
SENSE PERCEPTION AND KNOWLEDGE
^
^ The biggest problem with indirect 
perceptual realism is that the theory 
is simply irrelevant to perceptual 
knowledge. So, the question that 
we should focus on isn’t whether 
indirect perceptual realism is true 
but, rather, how sense perception 
supports knowledge. When we know 
something on the basis of what we 
perceive, how is our knowledge based 
on that perception?
^
^ There are different ways to 
answer this question. One is to ask 
whether the relation between sense 
perception and knowledge supports 
a foundationalist or a coherentist 
theory. The other is to ask whether 
the relation between our senses and 
our knowledge supports internalism 
or externalism.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 7  Does Sense Perception Support Knowledge?

60
I
n the remainder of this lecture, we’ll begin to 
tackle the first question. In particular, we’ll 
consider whether there is a good reason to suppose 
that coherentism offers the best explanation for how 
sense perception supports knowledge.
In the next lecture, we’ll first consider whether 
there is good reason for thinking that internalist 
foundationalism offers the best explanation for how 
sense perception supports knowledge or whether 
we ought to endorse some form of externalist 
explanation instead.
^
^ There are two different types of 
distinctions that we can make when we 
talk about perceptual processes, and 
the relation between those two types of 
distinctions is liable to cause confusion.
^
^ First, it’s important to distinguish 
between computations that you 
perform and computations that your 
brain performs but that you have no 
access to. Philosophers sometimes call 
the first type of processes—the ones 
that you normally have access to and 
at least some control over—personal 
processes. And they call the second 
type of processes—the ones that are 
performed by organs or systems of 
organs in the body, without direct 
access or control by the person whose 
body it is—subpersonal ones.
^
^ The second distinction is between 
what cognitive psychologists refer 
to as top-down and bottom-up 
processes.
^
^ A bottom-up process is one that 
arrives at a result from more basic 
inputs, where each of those inputs is 
computed independently. A bottom-
up theory of visual perception 
would suggest that information is 
transmitted in one direction from 
the retina to the visual cortex. On 
this type of theory, each stage in 
the mechanism for the processing 
of visual information involves 
increasingly complex analysis of the 
information transmitted from the 
immediately preceding stage.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 7  Does Sense Perception Support Knowledge?

61
^
^ Common versions of bottom-up 
theories include the idea that the 
neurons involved in each stage of 
visual information processing are 
highly specialized to perform a very 
specific type of computation. For 
example, there are neurons that just 
perform detection of light versus dark, 
or of edges that are oriented in a 
certain direction, or of motion.
^
^ In opposition to bottom-up views of 
perceptual information processing are 
top-down views. According to top-
down theories, the brain is able to use 
higher-level information as feedback 
for more basic sensory processing 
mechanisms in the brain. Top-down 
theorists reject the idea that the 
processing of sensory information in 
the brain moves in only one direction, 
from the more basic to the more 
complex. Instead, they suggest that 
the more complex computational 
mechanisms in the brain can provide 
feedback for earlier mechanisms.
^
^ A number of the pieces of evidence 
cited in favor of top-down theories 
have to do with the fact that your 
semantic knowledge—your knowledge 
of concepts and meaning—can affect 
what you perceive.
^
^ There seems to be at least some 
evidence for top-down processing of 
sensory information in the brain. And 
top-down processing involves taking 
context into account before deciding 
how to interpret information. And 
this, in turn, should remind you of 
coherentism—about the way in which 
beliefs can be justified enough to 
count as knowledge.
^
^ Remember, coherentism says that 
what makes an instance of true 
belief count as knowledge is that the 
belief fits together with the rest of 
your information. And the top-
down theory says that your sensory 
processing system takes different 
pieces of information and interprets 
them based on how they best fit 
together given the context.
^
^ Does that mean that the cognitive 
science of perception supports 
coherentism? That would be very 
strong support for the theory, but 
unfortunately for coherentism, top-
down theories don’t offer support 
for any theory of the structure of 
knowledge.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 7  Does Sense Perception Support Knowledge?

62
I
f all sense perception involved top-down processing, 
then we would expect newborns not to be able 
to perceive anything at all until they developed the 
concepts to help them make sense of what William 
James called the “blooming, buzzing confusion” of their 
immediate sensory stimuli.
This, however, is not the case. For example, newborn 
human infants seem to show a preference for face 
shapes over scrambled stimuli—as early as a few minutes 
after they’re born.
^
^ One problem is that top-down 
theories cannot tell the whole story 
of sense perception. There must be 
at least some room for bottom-up 
explanations as well.
^
^ The second problem for coherentism 
is even more serious. In order for 
some empirical evidence to support 
one of the theories of internalist 
justification, such as coherentism, 
it would have to involve personal 
computational mechanisms. That’s 
because coherentism is a theory about 
what goes on in the mind, rather than 
about the subpersonal mechanisms 
that are plugging away below the 
surface of your awareness or control.
^
^ The debate between top-down and 
bottom-up explanations, however, is 
best understood as involving just those 
sorts of subpersonal mechanisms. 
That’s because the debate is supposed 
to involve the sorts of computational 
processes to which you normally have 
no access and over which you normally 
have no control. So, even if the best 
explanation of sense perception is top-
down—and there is reason to question 
whether that’s even the case—it would 
still not support coherentism.

Perception: 
Foundationalism 
and Externalism
I
n the previous lecture, we ruled out the internalist theory of 
coherentism to provide the best explanation of the support for 
knowledge based on sense perception. This leaves us with one 
more type of internalist theory to consider: foundationalism. 
There are two types of foundationalism to evaluate: 
experience-based internalist foundationalism and naive 
foundationalism. Experience-based internalist foundationalism 
isn’t very plausible; in fact, it suffers from many of the same 
problems that plagued indirect perceptual realism. And naive 
foundationalism doesn’t provide us with an explanation of 
why sense perception provides evidence for knowledge; it 
doesn’t tell us, in other words, why finding out that someone 
believes some event occurred because he or she saw it 
him- or herself makes us more confident that the person has 
knowledge that the event occurred. If the internalist theories 

65
don’t work, that leaves us with externalism, and the evidence 
from the cognitive psychology of perception supports the idea 
that an externalist theory of how perception contributes to 
knowledge is indeed the most plausible.
EXPERIENCE-BASED INTERNALIST 
FOUNDATIONALISM
^
^ Experience-based internalist 
foundationalism is the view that all 
of our beliefs on the basis of sense 
perception are actually based on 
beliefs about the immediate qualities 
of our experiences—experiences of 
things like color patches and shapes—
rather than experiences of the objects 
that produce the stimulations of our 
sense organs that result in perception.
^
^ There are at least two big reasons 
why an experience-based internalist 
foundationalism won’t work.
B
oth reasons why an experience-based internalist 
foundationalism won’t work are related to 
points made in the previous lecture about what’s 
wrong about indirect perceptual realism.
]
] It suffers from the same problem 
as internalist coherentism when 
it comes to the issue of where 
computation, or conscious 
inference, takes place in the process 
from perceptual stimuli in the 
sense organs to perception-based 
knowledge.
[
[ On the experience-based 
internalist foundationalist 
picture, our knowledge on the 
basis of perception is ultimately 
founded on our knowledge 
of more basic facts about our 
experience. So, every instance 
of perception actually involves 
an inference—an inference that, 
if we pay close enough attention 
to our own mental processes, we 
can be aware of. But this idea is 
simply absurd.

[
[ As explained in the previous 
lecture, there is in fact a great 
deal of computation that 
occurs at the early stages of 
perception. And we can call these 
different types of computation 
“inferences” if we wish, but it is 
simply a mistake to think that 
we can access those “inferences,” 
however closely we attend to our 
mental processes.
[
[ Much of the computation—or 
inference, if you’d like—in 
perception happens prior to 
our awareness. Much of that 
computation is something your 
brain does, not something you do.
]
] It is also wrong about the content, 
or nature, of our experiences in 
perception.
[
[ According to the standard 
experience-based foundationalist 
picture, our experiences are the 
basis of our inferences about 
the objects in the world that 
cause those experiences, and 
those inferences then form our 
knowledge about the world. 
We’ve already seen reasons why 
this picture is inaccurate in 
the previous lecture, when we 
discussed the various problems 
faced by indirect perceptual 
realism.
[
[ Experience-based 
foundationalists like to act as if 
their position is more scientific 
and that it better accounts for 
the way experience involves 
interpretation on the part of 
the perceiver. In order for 
experience-based foundationalists 
to be truly scientific, however, 
they must be able to specify 
exactly what the basic building 
blocks of our experiences are—
the colors, shapes, and so on 
that make up those foundational 
experiences on the basis of which 
we construct everything else.
[
[ The problem is that the 
experience-based foundationalist 
can’t do this. There is the fact 
about what sort of information 
hits the retina and the fact 
about how that information is 
processed at various stages of 
the perceptual process, but those 
different types of information 
aren’t the experiences that the 
foundationalist is talking about. 
This means that the experience-
based foundationalist story 
is actually just that—a story, 
or fairy tale, with no basis in 
science. Science tells us that the 
information recorded by the 
retina, to take one example, is 
nothing like the sort of visual 
scene that even plausibly 
describes your experience. 
That visual scene is the result 
of a number of computational 
processes in the brain, none 
of which are accessible to 
awareness.

NAIVE FOUNDATIONALISM
^
^ Why not just abandon the part of 
experience-based foundationalism 
that we find objectionable? That 
is the idea that the ultimate basis 
of our perceptual knowledge is our 
experiences, described as highly 
abstract sensory qualities like color, 
shape, and so on. If we abandon 
that objectionable part of the 
experience-based foundationalist 
view, what we’re left with is naive 
foundationalism.
^
^ Naive foundationalism rejects 
the idea that we must ground our 
perceptual knowledge in beliefs about 
the qualities of our experiences. It 
involves the claim that we can base 
our perceptual knowledge simply on 
the perception of the objects in the 
world that our knowledge concerns.
^
^ According to the naive 
foundationalist, the basis of your 
perceptual knowledge that something 
is the case just is the perception that 
it’s the case. The problem with this 
view is that sometimes it seems to 
you that you perceive something 
and it turns out that you’re relying 
on a misleading perception. On the 
naive foundationalist view, there’s 
nothing to explain the difference 
in the support you have when you 
misleadingly perceive something to 
be the case and when you correctly 
perceive something to be the case.
^
^ That’s why we can’t simply accept 
naive foundationalism. Externalism 
will allow us to explain why certain 
perceptions support knowledge 
whereas other, misleading perceptions 
don’t. The difference the externalist 
can point to—but the naive 
foundationalist can’t—is the reliable 
accuracy of the perceptual systems 
that lead to knowledge.
^
^ Whether a perceptual system 
is reliably accurate or not is a 
fact external to the mind of any 
particular believer. And the naive 
foundationalist can’t appeal to 
reliable accuracy because, as an 
internalist, he or she can’t appeal to 
any criteria that are outside of the 
mind of the believer.
I
f the information presented in the previous lecture and this 
lecture is correct, neither coherentism nor foundationalism 
does a good job of explaining how sense perception gives us 
evidence for knowledge.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 8  Perception: Foundationalism and Externalism

68
E
vidence for the dual streams 
of visual information 
processing comes from studies 
conducted by neuroscientists 
David Milner and Melvyn Goodale.
EXTERNALISM
^
^ Two aspects are essential to 
externalist theories.
]
] They make reliable accuracy the 
central quality for determining 
whether a certain cognitive process 
is a source of knowledge. In the 
case of sense perception, this means 
that only those sensory processes 
that reliably give us accurate 
information about the world 
will count as potential sources of 
knowledge.
]
] They don’t require us to be aware of 
the operations of the processes that 
give us information. This means 
that externalist theories—in contrast 
with internalist theories—allow that 
it is possible that we can be unaware 
of the process we are employing to 
acquire information and of whether 
that process is in fact reliably 
accurate. In the case of sense 
perception, this means that we at 
least sometimes acquire information 
on the basis of sensory processes of 
which we’re unaware or about whose 
accuracy we’re unaware.
^
^ There is a great deal of support 
from cognitive psychology and 
neurobiology for both of these 
components of externalism. 
One example is the existence of 
dual streams of cognition for the 
processing of visual information, and 
another involves what neurologists 
call brain bilateralization, the fact 
that the two halves of the brain are 
specialized for different tasks that 
they can perform independently.
]
] One way that brain functions are 
specialized is between the dorsal 
and ventral streams. The visual 
cortex, the region of the brain 
that is responsible for receiving 
information from the eyes, is 
located at the back of the brain. 
The dorsal stream—or the “where” 
pathway—runs along the top of 
the cortex. It’s the visual system 
that aids in determining the spatial 
location of the objects around us, 
preparing us for any actions that we 
might want to perform with those 
objects. The other pathway is called 
the ventral stream—or the “what” 
pathway—and it is located on the 
underside of the cortex. It’s the 
network responsible for the visual 
identification of objects.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 8  Perception: Foundationalism and Externalism

69
]
] The brain has two halves, or 
hemispheres, which are joined by a 
very densely packed strand of nerve 
cells called the corpus callosum. 
There are some neurosurgical 
procedures, called split-brain 
surgeries, that require cutting 
the corpus callosum so that the 
two hemispheres of the brain 
can no longer communicate. For 
many years after the first split-
brain surgeries were performed, 
neurosurgeons didn’t think that 
cutting the corpus callosum had 
any effect on brain function. 
Certainly, split-brain patients didn’t 
claim to notice any difference 
before or after the surgery. That 
was the thought until neuroscientist 
Michael Gazzaniga began studying 
split-brain patients and found 
that the two sides of the brain are 
unable to make sense of what the 
opposite side is aware of.
^
^ The phenomena of dual-stream 
pathways for visual information 
processing and of split-brain cases 
seem to provide evidence for both of 
the aspects of sense perception that 
support externalism.
]
] Both involve evidence that some 
cognitive systems are more reliably 
accurate in either gathering 
or evaluating information in 
perception.
]
] Both support the idea that we are 
often unaware of the processes we 
actually employ in sense perception 
and that we are often equally 
unaware of whether or why the 
processes we employ are reliably 
accurate.
^
^ This suggests that, at least in the 
case of sense perception, externalism 
provides the best account for 
explaining the structure of knowledge.
T
o study the inability of the two sides of the brain to 
make sense of what the opposite side is aware of, 
Michael Gazzaniga and his team of researchers flashed 
an image to each eye of a split-brain patient while 
keeping that image hidden from the other eye. At the 
same time, they gave each patient’s hand an option to 
choose from one of four pictures that best matched the 
image. In other words, the left hand could choose from 
the pictures that matched the image that the left eye 
saw, and the right hand could choose from the pictures 
that matched the image that the right eye saw.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 8  Perception: Foundationalism and Externalism

70
One very dramatic illustration of the results of 
Gazzaniga’s research with split-brain patients is the case 
of a subject referred to as P.S.:
P.S. had seen a chicken claw with his left brain, 
and his right hand chose a picture of a chicken. 
His right brain had seen a picture of a snow 
scene, and his left hand picked up a picture of a 
shovel. When asked why he had done all of this, 
he said from his left hemisphere, ‘The chicken 
claw goes with the chicken, and you need a 
shovel to clean out the chicken shed.’
This suggested to Gazzaniga that there is a special 
mechanism in the brain—which he calls the interpreter—
that is responsible for explaining our behavior to 
ourselves. It concocts a plausible story for us about what 
is going on in our heads when we pause to think about 
what we’re perceiving or thinking. But importantly, what 
the interpreter concocts is just a story—one that’s often 
not very accurate.

The Importance 
of Memory for 
Knowledge
O
ur faculty of memory is central to our knowledge, 
and philosophers have had a number of things to say 
about the topic. Some of the philosophical theories 
are specific to the topic of memory while others 
are more related to the kinds of questions we have 
considered across a number of lectures. This lecture 
will address questions raised by the topic of memory 
specifically, including questions about what the 
objects of memories are. Are they stored experiences 
in the mind, or are they past events themselves? 
The questions also include whether memory 
merely preserves beliefs and knowledge that we’ve 
already acquired or whether we can ever gain new 
knowledge on the basis of memory.

73
TYPES OF MEMORY
^
^ There are three main types of 
memory: long-term, short-term, and 
working memory.
]
] Short-term memory stores small 
pieces of information for no more 
than a few seconds or so.
]
] Working memory, like short-term 
memory, also has to do with storing 
information for very short periods 
of time to aid with both reasoning 
and action.
]
] The type of memory that 
philosophers are concerned 
primarily with is long-
term memory.
^
^ There are three different types of 
long-term memory, roughly based 
on the type of information stored: 
procedural, semantic or declarative, 
and episodic.
]
] Procedural memory supports the 
ability to perform skilled actions. 
For example, if you know how 
to play a certain musical piece 
on the piano, that skill relies on 
procedural memory.
]
] Semantic or declarative memory 
involves the memory of events 
in terms of their descriptions. It 
involves information stored with 
the aid of language.
]
] Episodic memory involves the 
memory of experiences. Instead 
of being stored with the aid of 
language, episodic memory is 
what allows us to replay previous 
experiences at a later time.
T
hough psychologists nowadays generally distinguish 
the concept of working memory from that of short-
term memory, those differences don’t concern us here.
The summary of the reason for distinguishing between 
them is that short-term memory was initially thought 
to be a single, undifferentiated short-term information 
storage mechanism, whereas theories of working 
memory generally involve more specialized types 
of short-term storage for accomplishing different 
cognitive tasks.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 9  The Importance of Memory for Knowledge

74
I
nterestingly, the three types of long-term memory 
seem to be distinct, in that you can have one type 
without having either of the other two.
A phenomenon in cognitive psychology called 
aphantasia involves having little or no ability to form 
or manipulate mental images—no vivid imaginations 
or daydreams, for example. One of the phenomena 
often associated with aphantasia is severely deficient 
autobiographical memory, which is basically a lack of 
episodic memory capacity.
EPISODIC MEMORY
^
^ Episodic memory—memory of 
previously experienced objects and 
events—forms the basis of central 
uses of memory, such as eyewitness 
accounts and autobiographical 
memory. For that reason, it has been 
the most-discussed type of memory 
among philosophers.
^
^ What are the contents of our episodic 
memories? Are they the current 
memory experiences, or are they 
the past objects and events that we 
experienced? Do our memories 
themselves exist wholly in the present, 
or are they in part dependent on past 
objects or events?
^
^ Bertrand Russell believed that he 
had an argument to demonstrate 
that our memories are themselves not 
dependent on the past but are simply 
stored experiences:
b
bThere is no logical impossibility in 
the hypothesis that the world sprang 
into being five minutes ago, exactly 
as it then was, with a population 
that “remembered” a wholly unreal 
past. There is no logically necessary 
connection between events at different 
times; therefore, nothing that is 
happening now or will happen in the 
future can disprove the hypothesis that 
the world began five minutes ago.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 9  The Importance of Memory for Knowledge

75
^
^ Russell takes from this argument 
that because there is no logical 
impossibility in imagining a scenario 
in which all of the mental states 
that we take to be memories might 
actually refer to a supposed past that 
never took place, we should not define 
actual memories in terms of the past 
either. For Russell, the difference 
between our memory states and mere 
imagination lies solely in the fact that, 
in the case of memories, we believe 
them to be about the past.
S
umming up, Russell suggests:
Memory demands (a) an image, (b) a belief 
in the past existence …. The believing is a 
specific feeling or sensation or complex 
of sensations, different from expectation 
or bare assent in a 
way that makes the 
belief refer to the 
past; the reference 
to the past lies in 
the belief-feeling, 
not in the content 
believed.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 9  The Importance of Memory for Knowledge

76
^
^ There’s a fatal problem with Russell’s 
view, however. The problem is that 
Russell’s view actually relies on the 
traditional view of memory that he 
claims to reject.
^
^ Scottish philosopher Thomas Reid 
made this point very forcefully. He 
was arguing specifically against his 
contemporary David Hume’s theory 
of memory, which was a forerunner of 
Russell’s.
^
^ Reid first notes that the commonsense 
view of memory is that it is an 
immediate knowledge of something 
that occurred in the past. And he 
notes that the view he’s arguing 
against—the view held by both 
Russell and Hume—is that there isn’t 
any such knowledge in the mind.
^
^ That’s because, according to both 
Russell and Hume, “memory 
is nothing but a present idea or 
impression.” In contrast to Russell’s 
view, for Thomas Reid the object 
of our memories are the past events 
themselves that we remember. In fact, 
as Reid has argued, this is precisely 
what distinguishes memory from 
perception or mere imagination.
^
^ Because your current experiences 
don’t belong to the past but rather 
are currently occurring, Reid argues 
in particular that the objects of your 
memories cannot be your current 
experiences. If Reid is right about 
this, then the Russell-Hume view of 
memory is wrong. Memories are not 
simply a type of current experience. 
Instead, they essentially involve a link 
to some previous object or event.
THE CAUSAL THEORY OF MEMORY
^
^ Despite the fact that Thomas Reid 
offered a devastating criticism of 
Russell’s view of memory almost 150 
years before Russell proposed his 
theory, it wasn’t until the middle of 
the 20th century that philosophers 
began to appreciate Reid’s idea that 
memory requires a connection to a 
past object or event.
^
^ Then, in a 1966 article entitled 
“Remembering,” C. B. Martin 
and Max Deutscher provided an 
argument in favor of what is known 
as the causal theory of memory. 
According to that theory, memory 
involves a certain type of causal 
connection between your current 
cognitive state and the object or event 
that you remember. Since the article’s 
publication, the causal theory has 
become widely accepted within the 
philosophical community.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 9  The Importance of Memory for Knowledge

77
I
n a 2017 article in the Stanford Encyclopedia of 
Philosophy, philosophers of memory Kourken 
Michaelian and John Sutton wrote, 
The idea that remembering is characterized 
by an appropriate causal connection has 
... taken on the status of philosophical 
common sense.
^
^ Although the broad idea of some 
sort of connection between the past 
event and your current cognitive 
state is important for memory, recent 
discussions in philosophy have 
continued to pick away at specific 
components of the causal account.
^
^ Consider a case in which it seems 
to you as if you remember a certain 
object or event. What makes that 
apparent memory a genuine instance 
of memory is if your seeming memory 
has a reliably stable, continuous 
brain-based connection to the past 
object or event that you seem to 
remember. This “reliably stable 
connection” view has two advantages 
that it inherits from the classic Martin 
and Deutscher account.
^
^ First, it allows us to distinguish a 
number of cases of merely apparent 
memories from those of genuine 
memories.
^
^ Suppose Harry visited Disneyland 
when he was four with his family. 
While there, he got separated 
from his family. Years pass and 
Harry forgets that experience. One 
day, Harry reads a book about a 
character who, at the age of four, 
visits Disneyland with his family and 
gets separated from them. The story 
makes an impression on Harry, so 
much so that years later, he comes to 
take the memory of the experience of 
the character in the book as if it’s his 
own. When Harry later remembers 
the experience of getting lost at the 
age of four at Disneyland, it’s because 
he read it in the book—not because it 
really happened to him. In a case like 
this, even though Harry really did get 
lost at Disneyland at the age of four, 
we wouldn’t want to call that seeming 
memory a genuine memory. It lacks 
the reliably stable connection to the 
actual event.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 9  The Importance of Memory for Knowledge

78
^
^ The second kind of case, taken from 
Martin and Deutscher’s 1966 article, 
is described as follows:
b
b[L]et us say that [Kent] has told 
his friend Gray what he saw of an 
accident in which he was involved. 
Kent has a second accident in which 
he gets a blow on the head which 
destroys all memory of a period in 
his past, including the time at which 
the first accident occurred. When 
Gray finds that Kent can no longer 
remember the first accident, he tells 
him those details which Kent had 
told Gray in the period between the 
first and second accidents. After a 
little while Kent forgets that anyone 
has told him about the first accident, 
but still remembers what he was told 
by Gray. It is clear that he does not 
remember the accident itself. ... Kent 
witnessed the first accident, can now 
recount what he saw of it, but does 
not remember it.
^
^ Martin and Deutscher introduce 
this example to demonstrate that the 
reliably stable connection component 
of the theory isn’t enough. There is 
a reliably stable connection between 
Kent’s experience of the first 
accident and his later memory of it, 
but the reliably stable connection 
consists in part in Gray’s recollection 
and testimony to Kent as to what 
occurred in that first accident. What’s 
missing from the case of Kent is the 
“continuous brain-based connection.” 
This is why Kent’s seeming to 
remember also can’t count as a 
genuine instance of remembering.
^
^ Because many philosophers found 
Reid’s criticisms of Hume (and by 
extension Russell) compelling and 
because of the popularity of the 
causal theory of memory, in the years 
since the publication of Martin and 
Deutscher’s article, a great many 
philosophers have come to think that 
memory has a very specific sort of 
limitation when it comes to providing 
support for knowledge.
^
^ To see that, let’s look back at some 
other sources of knowledge, such as 
self-awareness and sense perception.
]
] If you’re currently experiencing 
a certain mental state—say, a 
headache—and you ask yourself 
whether you are, you can form 
the belief that you are currently 
experiencing a headache. That’s a 
new piece of information, one that 
you didn’t previously have.
]
] If you look outside and see that 
there are now two robins in the 
shrub outside your window, that’s 
also a new piece of information. 
The only way that you could now 
know that there are currently two 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 9  The Importance of Memory for Knowledge

79
robins in that shrub would be to 
check and see for yourself, or to 
have somebody else tell you.
^
^ This suggests to philosophers that 
both self-awareness and sense 
perception are generative sources of 
knowledge—both can generate new 
knowledge, or give you knowledge 
that you didn’t previously have.
^
^ For a long time, the common view 
among philosophers has been 
that memory is not a generative 
source of knowledge. Instead, most 
philosophers hold that memory is a 
preservative source of knowledge. 
This means that you can’t know 
something on the basis of memory 
unless you knew it at some previous 
time on the basis of some other source 
of knowledge.
^
^ Take the case of your headache again. 
If your current knowledge that you 
had a headache at some earlier time 
is based on memory, then that can 
only be because at that earlier time 
you knew about your headache on the 
basis of self-awareness.
^
^ Recently, however, some philosophers 
have begun to question the received 
view that memory is a purely 
preservative source of knowledge. 
For example, philosophy professor 
Jennifer Lackey has offered a number 
of examples of cases that she takes to 
illustrate the possibility of memory as 
a generative source of knowledge.

Confabulations 
and False Memories
H
ow does memory knowledge fit into the general 
picture of knowledge that has been developed so 
far? Is it best understood as having a coherentist or 
foundationalist structure? Can internalist or externalist 
theories explain how our memories provide us with 
evidence for knowledge?

82
F
lashbulb memories involve the feeling of 
particularly clear memories that arise at a time 
of heightened public emotion—such as the JFK 
assassination, the moon landing, the O. J. Simpson 
verdict, or 9/11. But although these memories feel 
incredibly clear and precise, they’re actually not. 
They can involve embellishments and alterations as 
they are recalled and re-recalled over time.
COHERENTISM AND MEMORY
^
^ On the coherentist picture, what 
makes your true belief count as 
knowledge is that it forms part of a 
coherent framework of other beliefs 
that you have. In order to evaluate 
the coherentist picture of memory 
knowledge, there are two points 
to consider.
]
] We need to distinguish a descriptive 
account of what goes on in 
remembering from a normative 
account of what would need to 
go on for that remembering to 
count as knowledge. Basically, 
a descriptive account says what 
actually happens while a normative 
account says what should happen. 
Applying that to memory, we need 
to distinguish two separate things: 
what we—or our brains—actually 
do in remembering a past object or 
event and what we would have to 
do to provide memory support for 
our knowledge.
]
] In the lectures on how sense 
perception supports knowledge, 
we distinguished between tasks 
that you perform and tasks that 
only your brain performs. The 
distinction is that the tasks that 
only your brain performs, called 
subpersonal tasks, are ones that 
you’re not aware of and that you 
have no control over.
^
^ Researchers in the cognitive 
psychology and neurobiology of 
memory have a pretty clear idea 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 10  Confabulations and False Memories

83
that the act of recalling a memory is 
less like pulling up an old file from a 
drawer and more like reconstructing 
a picture from stored pieces according 
to schematic instructions. In other 
words, the way our brains bring up 
memories of previous events fits well 
with the coherentist picture.
^
^ In the 2010 article “Why Science 
Tells Us Not to Rely on Eyewitness 
Accounts” in Scientific American Mind, 
psychology professors Hal Arkowitz 
and Scott Lilienfeld review some of 
the literature on episodic memory, 
particularly as it relates to eyewitness 
testimony. They note:
b
bThe act of remembering, says 
eminent memory researcher and 
psychologist Elizabeth F. Loftus of 
the University of California, Irvine, 
is “more akin to putting puzzle 
pieces together than retrieving a 
video recording.”
^
^ One issue with appealing to the way 
the brain puts puzzle pieces together 
to reconstruct memories is that this 
seems to be something that often just 
the brain does, rather than something 
that we do. In other words, it seems 
to be one of those cognitive processes 
that is subpersonal rather than 
personal. However, for a process to 
count as evidence for a coherentist 
structure of knowledge, the process 
would have to be a personal process, 
rather than a subpersonal one.
^
^ The issue of the distinction between 
subpersonal and personal processes 
seems to pose a problem for the 
coherentist, but the next issue is, if 
anything, even worse. This involves 
the descriptive versus normative 
distinction.
^
^ The problem is that what Loftus 
describes is how our brains actually 
reconstruct memories. However, it’s a 
separate question as to whether that 
way of reconstructing memories is 
reliably accurate. And there is good 
reason to be skeptical about whether 
mere coherence is sufficient to 
guarantee accuracy.
^
^ As Arkowitz and Lilienfeld 
emphasize, something as simple 
as questioning from a lawyer can 
change an eyewitness’s memory of 
events. That’s because the witness can 
unwittingly change the memory by 
adding information that the lawyer 
provides during questioning.
^
^ The problem for the coherentist is 
that if you make having knowledge 
dependent on being able to spin a 
good yarn, then sometimes the best 
or most believable yarns aren’t in 
fact true.

Lecture 10  Confabulations and False Memories

^
^ An extreme example of what’s 
wrong with the coherentist picture 
of memory knowledge is the case 
of confabulations—the stories that 
people unknowingly make up to fill 
in the holes in their memory. They 
are particularly common in people 
with cognitive or mental disorders, 
but otherwise healthy individuals 
also confabulate. It is important to 
remember that confabulation is a 
subpersonal process; the person isn’t 
intentionally making things up and 
isn’t aware that he or she is doing 
anything other than recalling a 
past event.
^
^ It doesn’t seem plausible to think of 
the structure of memory knowledge in 
coherentist terms.
FOUNDATIONALISM AND MEMORY
^
^ There are two basic types of 
foundationalist theory of memory 
knowledge—the inferential theory 
and the naive foundational theory—
and they are similar in structure 
to the two types of foundationalist 
theory of knowledge on the basis of 
sense perception.
^
^ According to the inferential theory, 
the way that you acquire knowledge 
on the basis of memory is that you 
have a memory experience and then 
you argue that, given that experience, 
what you seem to remember probably 
did occur.
^
^ For example, consider a case of 
discursive knowledge. Suppose you 
seem to remember that George 
Washington was the first president of 
the United States of America. You’d 
then reason as follows:
1	 I seem to remember that 
Washington was the first president 
of the United States of America.
2	 In the past, whenever I have 
seemed to remember something, it 
has usually turned out that what I 
remembered is true.
3	 Therefore, it’s probably true 
that Washington was the first 
president of the United States 
of America.
^
^ This model seems very implausible 
as described. It just doesn’t seem 
that memory works like that. But 
there’s a more serious problem with 
this model: It is viciously circular. In 
order to establish the second step of 
the argument, you have to remember 
what happened in the past. This 
is the problem that Reid raised for 
the Hume and Russell model of 
memory presented in the previous 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 10  Confabulations and False Memories

85
lecture. So, the inferential form of 
foundationalism is a nonstarter.
^
^ According to the naive theory, 
memory gives you a good reason to 
believe something when you seem to 
remember it and you are not presently 
aware of anything that suggests that 
what you remember is false.
^
^ In some ways, this seems a much 
more plausible picture of how 
memory actually works—as a 
personal process. In other words, 
when you ask yourself how it feels 
to remember something, it doesn’t 
feel like you’re putting puzzle pieces 
together, nor does it feel like you’re 
formulating an argument. Instead, 
it feels like you remember something 
and—unless you have some specific 
reason to question that memory—it’s 
okay simply to rely on what you 
remember.
^
^ However, there are two very 
significant problems for the 
naive theory.
]
] Consider a case in which you see 
some event but have reason at the 
time to doubt that what you’re 
seeing is genuine. For example, 
suppose you see a very well-
executed fake documentary in 
which a group of children seems 
to knock down a grown man 
and steal his briefcase, but you 
know that it’s a fake documentary 
because you’re viewing it in the 
context of a film festival of fictive 
documentary films. At a later 
date, you remember what you 
experienced previously, but you’ve 
forgotten the reasons you had at the 
time to doubt what you saw. As far 
as the naive theory is concerned, 
this would be a case in which you 
have good reason to believe the 
children really did knock down the 
grown man and steal his briefcase. 
That’s because your memory now 
meets the two conditions required 
by the naive theory: You seem to 
remember the children committing 
the theft, and you are not presently 
aware of anything that suggests 
what you remember is false. This 
seems strange, however. It would 
be odd if your forgetfulness of the 
evidence rebutting your experience 
would actually help you. But that’s 
exactly what the naive theory 
suggests in this case.
]
] When we remember something, 
our brains fill in the remembered 
experience with plausible details. 
Rather than being a recording 
of the details of the experience 
that is simply recalled in the 
brain, a memory is more like a 
reconstruction. This is one of 
the ways that our memories can 
mislead us, and it is the source 
of one of the problems for the 
coherentist picture of memory.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 10  Confabulations and False Memories

86
P
sychologists call our ability to remember where 
we acquired a particular piece of information 
source monitoring. The problem is that we’re really 
bad at source monitoring. It’s maybe not surprising 
that we’re bad at remembering the specific source 
of information—say, whether we read something 
in The New York Times versus The Wall Street 
Journal. However, it turns out that we’re even bad 
at remembering whether we actually read the 
information at all—rather than, say, hearing it during 
a 10-minute gossip session at the water cooler.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 10  Confabulations and False Memories

87
Even more dramatically, we often mistake the source 
of our memory as involving our own experiences 
when the source was actually something we read or 
heard or a photo we saw.
Our difficulties with source monitoring pose a 
problem for foundationalism. Part of the plausibility 
of naive foundationalism is that when you have a 
seeming memory, the memory experience you have 
isn’t devoid of additional information. In other words, 
it’s not merely a seeming memory experience of a 
past object or event (if it’s an episodic memory) or 
of a supposed fact (if it’s a declarative memory).
Instead, the seeming memory experience also 
contains information of its supposed source; that 
is, you remember it as something you experienced 
yourself or as something you heard or read. And the 
fact that you remember it as having come from a 
certain source seems to be part of what makes the 
supposed memory so believable.
But if it’s true that we are subject to source 
monitoring failures we’re unaware of, this suggests 
that the naive foundationalist theory is just that—
naive. We should look for something better.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 10  Confabulations and False Memories

88
I
f what’s been presented so far in this lecture is correct, 
neither form of internalism—neither coherentism nor 
foundationalism—does a good job of explaining how memory 
provides us with support for knowledge.
But there are some ways in which both coherentism and 
foundationalism add to our understanding of how memory 
contributes to knowledge.
It is in fact likely that the computational processes involved 
in the retrieval of memories from the information encoded in 
the brain operate according to coherentist principles. Because 
of this, it is plausible that an investigation of how coherence 
can contribute to accurate reconstructions of information 
will be useful for cognitive scientists. It will help them better 
understand how the brain supports the encoding, storage, 
and retrieval of memories. In other words, paying attention to 
the lessons we learn from coherentism can help us understand 
the subpersonal mechanisms involved in memory.
Furthermore, the way it feels to rely on memory for 
information seems to be best explained by a foundationalist 
account. For that reason, when it comes to explaining why 
someone might behave in a certain way on the basis of his 
or her memory, it would be good to pay attention to lessons 
we’ve learned from foundationalism. In other words, appealing 
to foundationalism can help us understand how memory 
contributes to the personal factors that can help explain 
someone’s behavior.
The problem is that neither coherentism nor foundationalism 
is sufficient to explain how memory can support knowledge. 
That’s because neither of them does a good job of accounting 
for if and when memories are reliably accurate. In order to do 
that, we’ll need to turn to a consideration of externalism.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 10  Confabulations and False Memories

89
EXTERNALISM AND MEMORY
^
^ Remember, there are two aspects that 
are essential to externalist theories.
]
] They make reliable accuracy the 
central quality for determining 
whether a certain cognitive process 
is a source of knowledge. In the 
case of memory, this means that 
only those memory processes 
that reliably give us accurate 
information about the remembered 
facts, objects, or events will count as 
potential sources of knowledge.
]
] They don’t require that we 
be aware of the operations 
of the processes that give us 
information. This means that 
externalist theories—in contrast 
with internalist theories—allow 
that we can be unaware of the 
process we are employing to 
acquire information and ignorant 
of whether that process is in fact 
reliably accurate. In the case of 
memory, this means that we at least 
sometimes acquire information on 
the basis of memory processes we’re 
unaware of or whose accuracy we 
cannot confirm.
^
^ It seems that the phenomena of 
confabulation and source monitoring 
failures provide evidence for both of 
the aspects of memory that support 
externalism.
]
] Both involve evidence that some 
cognitive systems are more reliably 
accurate in encoding, storing, or 
retrieving information in memory.
]
] Both support the idea that we are 
often unaware of the processes that 
we actually employ in memory and 
that we are often equally unaware 
of whether or why the processes we 
employ are reliably accurate.
^
^ This suggests that, as was the case 
with sense perception, externalism 
provides the best account for 
explaining the structure of knowledge 
in the case of memory.
^
^ There’s one further reason why the 
phenomenon of memory provides 
us with a strong motivation for 
embracing externalism. It’s known 
within philosophy as the problem of 
forgotten evidence.
^
^ Often, we retain a particular well-
justified belief without remembering 
the evidence that originally led us 
to form the belief in the first place. 
Two related phenomena are forgotten 
negative evidence and source 
monitoring failures. But in each 
of these cases, the problem is that 
foundationalism is forced to say that 
a belief that shouldn’t count as well 
justified does count as well justified.
^
^ The problem of forgotten evidence is 
the mirror image of those problems 
for foundationalism. This is a 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 10  Confabulations and False Memories

90
problem because the belief is well 
supported; it’s just not well supported 
by any belief or experience that the 
believer still possesses. But because 
all internalist theories—whether 
coherentist or foundationalist—base 
the support for your belief on what’s 
currently in your mind, they cannot 
account for a belief that is supported 
by evidence you no longer possess. 
Externalist theories, however, 
require a reliably accurate process 
to explain what makes a belief well 
supported. Because a process can 
involve components that are no 
longer present, externalist theories 
don’t seem to have a problem with 
forgotten evidence.
A
ll of this suggests that considerations of 
memory knowledge provide further support for 
externalist theories of knowledge in general.

The Extended Mind
W
ith the rise of interest in the extended mind, 
philosophers and cognitive scientists have begun 
to question whether memory is limited to a 
brain-based connection to some past object or 
event or whether other types of processes for 
recording information outside of the brain could 
count as forms of memory. The 1998 paper in the 
philosophy journal Analysis written by professors 
of philosophy Andy Clark and David Chalmers 
entitled “The Extended Mind” gave the hypothesis 
its name. Even if you remain skeptical about the 
notion of extending the mind, the lessons you 
learn in this lecture will nevertheless be significant 
for the discussion of the structure of knowledge.

93
USE OF THE ENVIRONMENT AS A COGNITIVE AID
^
^ Actions like using pen and paper 
for a mathematical calculation 
or using Scrabble tiles to aid in 
brainstorming possible words to 
spell are called epistemic actions 
by Clark and Chalmers. Epistemic 
actions are, as they put it, actions 
that “alter the world so as to aid and 
augment cognitive processes such as 
recognition and search.”
^
^ Some of the epistemic actions are 
such that they essentially involve 
environmental aids to successfully 
complete the cognitive task. Using a 
pen and paper for long division seems 
like one such action.
^
^ Those cases involve what Clark 
and Chalmers call coupled systems, 
composed of a human reasoner 
and some portion of his or her 
environment. They define a coupled 
system as a case where
b
bthe human organism is linked with 
an external entity in a two-way 
interaction, creating a coupled 
system that can be seen as a cognitive 
system in its own right. All the 
components in the system play an 
active causal role, and they jointly 
govern behavior in the same sort of 
way that cognition usually does. If 
we remove the external component 
the system’s behavioral competence 
will drop, just as it would if we 
removed part of its brain.
^
^ By appeal to the dual notions of 
epistemic actions and coupled 
systems, Clark and Chalmers define 
their position as active externalism. 
By this term, they mean that when we 
are engaged in epistemic actions, we 
(at least sometimes) count as coupled 
systems with external entities that are 
genuinely cognitive.
C
lark and Chalmers 
sum up the central 
claim of the extended 
mind hypothesis like so: 
“If, as we confront some 
task, a part of the world 
functions as a process 
which, were it done in 
the head, we would 
have no hesitation in 
recognizing as part of 
the cognitive process, 
then that part of the 
world is (so we claim) 
part of the cognitive 
process.”
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 11  The Extended Mind

94
^
^ The main strategy Clark and 
Chalmers pursue in the extended 
mind hypothesis is argument by 
analogy. They try to present a case in 
which a process that extends outside 
of the brain has all the marks of a 
cognitive process and then argue that 
we should therefore recognize that 
case as a genuinely cognitive process.
^
^ An analogy that Clark and Chalmers 
develop in some detail has two cases 
(although they also discuss a third 
case that we won’t consider).
]
] The first case involves Inga and 
a normal brain-based belief. Inga 
hears about an exhibition that 
she wants to see at the Museum 
of Modern Art. She recalls that 
MoMA is located on 53rd Street, so 
she heads there and waits in line to 
enter the museum. In other words, 
Inga represents a typical case of 
declarative memory.
]
] The second case involves Otto, 
who has Alzheimer’s disease. Like 
many people with Alzheimer’s, 
Otto relies on environmental 
supports to provide him with aids 
in structuring his daily life. In 
particular, Otto carries a notebook 
with him that he uses as a support. 
Whenever he learns something 
new and significant, he records it 
in the notebook. If he needs some 
information, he looks it up. Otto 
hears about the exhibition at the 
MoMA and also wants to see it. 
He looks up the address of MoMA 
in his notebook and reads in the 
notebook that it is located on 53rd 
Street. So, Otto heads to 53rd 
Street and waits in line to enter 
the museum.
^
^ What Clark and Chalmers want to 
underscore is that Inga’s brain-based 
belief and Otto’s notebook-based 
belief function the same way in 
explaining their actions. Just like 
Inga, Otto headed toward 53rd 
Street because he wanted to go to the 
MoMA and that’s where he believed 
the MoMA to be. In Inga’s case, 
philosophers would naturally say that 
she possesses the dispositional belief 
that the museum is on 53rd Street 
even when she’s not considering it. So, 
Clark and Chalmers argue, we should 
also say that Otto believes that the 
museum is on 53rd Street even when 
he isn’t consulting what he’s recorded 
in his notebook. The key point, 
according to Clark and Chalmers, is 
that the information that Inga and 
Otto have stored functions in exactly 
the same way for both of them. For 
that reason, it shouldn’t matter if that 
information is stored in the brain or 
in a notebook.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 11  The Extended Mind

C
lark and Chalmers suggest that there are no 
relevant differences between Inga’s brain-based 
memory belief and Otto’s notebook-based belief. 
Otto’s external “memory” is just as integral to his 
daily functioning as Inga’s internal, brain-based 
memory is to hers.
^
^ But are there really no relevant 
differences between the Inga case and 
the Otto case?
^
^ Clark and Chalmers suggest that 
we might raise four worries about 
whether the cases really are that 
similar. There might be differences 
in reliability, stability, accessibility, or 
phenomenology.
^
^ The first two potential differences 
between Inga and Otto are reliability 
and stability. You might worry that 
Otto’s method for remembering using 
his notebook is less reliable or stable 
than Inga’s. This, however, seems to be 
obviously wrongheaded. If anything, 
the method of using a notebook as an 
external “memory” is more reliable 
and stable than using your internal, 
brain-based memory—not less.
^
^ Of course, using the notebook as an 
external memory does open you to 
the possibility that it might get lost. 
But this possibility exists for your 
brain-based memory as well. Not only 
do we often lose individual memories, 
but there is also the more dramatic 
possibility that, through disease or 
injury, we could experience more 
significant memory loss.
^
^ The other two differences—
phenomenology and accessibility—
are more serious.
^
^ In the case of phenomenology, it 
doesn’t seem that there is a relevant 
difference between the phenomenology 
of brain-based declarative memory 
and Otto’s notebook-based memory. 
The reason for this is that there is 
no phenomenology of brain-based 
declarative memory.
^
^ Suppose someone asks you who the 
13th president of the United States 
was. When you remember a fact or 
piece of information, it just comes 
to you—or it doesn’t. Perhaps you 
have the feeling of making an effort 
to remember, but there’s no special 
feeling associated with remembering 
the information itself.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 11  The Extended Mind

96
^
^ There does seem to be a difference 
in phenomenology for episodic 
memory. Brain-based memories in 
which you imaginatively “relive” 
a past experience seem to be more 
difficult to “offload” onto the 
environment. But perhaps with the 
rapid improvements of interactive 
technologies, even that difference will 
become less significant.
^
^ The difference in accessibility is a 
more serious objection. Inga can 
access her memory in the dark or 
when her hands are full, whereas 
Otto cannot access his notebook in 
those types of situations.
^
^ Clark and Chalmers recognize 
the seriousness of the accessibility 
objection. They grant that the brain 
and body can be thought of as a 
self-contained set of fundamental 
cognitive resources. Furthermore, we 
obviously take our brains and bodies 
with us wherever we go, so there’s 
no question that those resources are 
optimally accessible to us. Given this 
fact, it seems natural to distinguish 
cognitive tasks that we can perform 
with our brains alone—or even with 
the aid of our fingers, say, in the case 
of arithmetic—from cognitive tasks 
that we perform with a portable 
electronic device.
^
^ Nevertheless, Clark and Chalmers 
don’t think that the accessibility 
issue ultimately is a problem for the 
extended mind hypothesis.
EXTERNALISM AND THE EXTENDED MIND
^
^ Recent studies seem to demonstrate 
that there is growing empirical 
evidence that fits well with the 
extended mind hypothesis. But even 
if you are still unsure about whether 
you find the hypothesis ultimately 
convincing, the question of whether 
the extended mind or extended 
cognition is a genuine phenomenon is 
interesting in its own right.
^
^ Certainly, it might be very relevant 
to the specific topic of memory 
knowledge that we’ve been examining 
over the past few lectures. But 
the question is not all that central 
to the more general topics we’ve 
been discussing. Instead, we can 
take lessons from our discussion of 
the phenomena surrounding the 
topic of the extended mind for the 
more general questions concerning 
knowledge, regardless of how we feel 
about the specific issue of whether the 
mind really is—or can be—extended.
^
^ If our discussion of the extended 
mind has taught us anything, it’s 
that the specific process that leads 
to forming a belief matters. Suppose 
you’re trying to evaluate whether to 
believe your friend Bill when he tells 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 11  The Extended Mind

97
you that 53,735 divided by 29 equals 
1,852 with a remainder of 27. Unless 
you know that your friend is some sort 
of savant, it will make a difference to 
you if you know whether he solved the 
problem using pencil and paper or 
had to try to do it in his head.
^
^ In the case of long division, in other 
words, the process of using pencil 
and paper makes you more reliably 
accurate in your calculations. For 
that reason, an externalist about 
knowledge will want to describe the 
process you employ when you solve 
a long division problem using pencil 
and paper as a different process than 
the one that you employ if you’re 
forced to try to solve the problem in 
your head. And whether your belief 
about the solution to a particular long 
division problem counts as knowledge 
will quite likely depend on which of 
those processes you use.
^
^ This means that the externalist has 
an advantage when describing the 
kinds of knowledge you acquire when 
you employ processes that extend out 
into the world outside of your brain 
and body. And because the claim 
that the process extends out into the 
world doesn’t depend on any claims 
about the extended mind or extended 
cognition, the externalist has this 
advantage even if you insist that the 
mind is not extended but is limited to 
the confines of your brain—or your 
brain and body.

onsider the claim that equilateral triangles have three 
equivalent angles. Presumably, you can figure out that 
this claim is true. But how? Certainly, you don’t have 
to draw a triangle and examine it to check. And even 
if you did draw a triangle to check, that would actually 
only tell you that at least one equilateral triangle—the 
triangle you just drew—has three equivalent angles. 
It wouldn’t give you evidence that all equilateral 
triangles have three equivalent angles. It turns out 
that there are deep philosophical issues surrounding 
the question of how we know the truth of the claim 
that all equilateral triangles have three equivalent 
angles and other claims like it.

100
RATIONALISTS VERSUS EMPIRICISTS
^
^ The traditional philosophical 
controversy about how we know that 
all equilateral triangles have three 
equivalent angles involves a debate 
between two diametrically opposed 
schools of thought. One school of 
thought, the rationalists, argue that 
humans possess a distinct faculty of 
reason and that humans could know 
truths of reason—such as the truth 
about the angles of an equilateral 
triangle—by exercising their faculty 
of reason.
^
^ In fact, at the extreme, rationalists 
believe that all knowledge is derived 
from reason. For example, Descartes 
holds that in order to have knowledge 
of something, you have to have 
infallible evidence—evidence that 
could not be false. Because the senses 
are fallible, Descartes does not think 
that the senses can provide you with 
knowledge. Only reason can provide 
you with infallible evidence. So, for 
Descartes, only reason can provide 
you with knowledge.
^
^ Descartes and the other rationalists 
seem to do okay with our knowledge 
of the truths of reason, but they don’t 
do so well with our knowledge of facts 
about the world, such as whether it’s 
hot outside. These facts do not seem 
like the types of things you could 
know by reasoning your way to an 
answer. You would have to look and 
see how the world actually is—or 
remember what you saw when you 
did look.
^
^ On the opposite end of the 
spectrum from the rationalists are 
the empiricists, including such 
philosophers as John Locke and 
David Hume—according to whom 
all knowledge is derived from 
experience.
^
^ Their situation looks like a mirror 
image of the rationalists’ situation. 
The empiricists seem to do well 
with our knowledge of facts about 
the world. It seems pretty obvious 
to think that those are the kinds of 
things that we learn from experience. 
But you can know about the angles of 
an equilateral triangle without ever 
seeing a triangle.
^
^ This is how the debate stood until 
the middle of the 18th century, when 
Immanuel Kant entered the picture. 
He suggested that the debate between 
rationalism and empiricism was a 
fruitless one because the two sides 
had thought about their disagreement 
too simplistically. Kant hoped to show 
that by thinking more clearly about 
what the debate involved, we would 
also be able to find a solution to the 
conflict.

efenders of rationalism include René Descartes, 
Benedict de Spinoza, and Gottfried Wilhelm 
Leibniz; defenders of empiricism include Thomas 
Hobbes, John Locke, George Berkeley, and 
David Hume.
KANT’S DISTINCTIONS
^
^ Where rationalists thought in terms 
of truths known by virtue of reason 
alone and empiricists thought in 
terms of truths known in virtue of 
experience alone, Kant suggested 
that we introduce two different 
distinctions: one between analytic 
and synthetic claims and another 
between a priori and a posteriori 
knowledge.
^
^ The distinction between analytic 
and synthetic claims has to do with 
whether the truth of a claim depends 
on the meaning of the words used to 
make the claim.
^
^ An analytic claim is a claim that you 
can know to be true solely on the 
basis of the meaning of the words 
in it. For example, if you know what 
“poodle” means and you know what 
“dog” means, then you know that the 
claim “all poodles are dogs” is true.
^
^ Contrast that with the claim “some 
poodles are white.” That’s a synthetic 
claim. It’s also true, but you can’t 
know that it’s true simply by knowing 
the meaning of the words in the 
claim. You also have to actually get 
out in the world and look at some 
poodles.
^
^ The second distinction is one that gets 
directly at the disagreement between 
rationalists and empiricists. It’s based 
on whether the evidence you have 
comes from experience.
^
^ The knowledge that we have of things 
on the basis of specific experiences 
is called a posteriori knowledge by 
Kant. If you look outside and see that 
it’s sunny outside where you are, that’s 
a posteriori knowledge. As a nod 
to the empiricists, Kant was happy 
to admit that we have that kind of 
knowledge.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 12  Do We Have Innate Knowledge?

102
^
^ However, Kant also thought it 
obvious that some things you know 
are based on evidence that doesn’t 
come from experience. He called 
those cases of a priori knowledge—
knowledge that you have independent 
of any specific experience that 
supports it.
^
^ Empiricists can be happy with some 
of that type of knowledge. Take the 
claim “all poodles are dogs.” Suppose 
you grew up on an island where 
there were no poodles, let alone any 
other type of dog. You’ve never seen 
a canine of any type. Nevertheless, if 
you know English, you can still know 
that all poodles are dogs.
^
^ In other words, some of our a priori 
knowledge is knowledge that we gain 
simply by knowing the meaning of 
words, even if we don’t have any 
specific experience with the things or 
qualities named by those words.
^
^ This sort of a priori knowledge also 
involves analytic claims—claims that 
you can know are true simply because 
of the words they involve.
^
^ This might seem a bit strange, but 
it shouldn’t be. There are many 
cases in which we can learn a lot 
about something without directly 
experiencing it, simply by learning 
facts about language.
^
^ Kant thought that there 
was knowledge that we have 
independently of experience that isn’t 
simply implied by the meanings of the 
words we use to state that knowledge. 
In particular, Kant thought that there 
were two big branches of knowledge 
that involved the synthetic a priori: 
mathematics and philosophy.
]
] According to Kant, when you 
discover that 17,361 divided by 27 
equals 643, you’re doing something 
more than simply relying on the 
meanings of the terms in that 
statement. Another way of saying 
this is that you can understand the 
meanings of 17,361, 27, and 643 
and still wonder whether 17,361 
divided by 27 is equal to 643. 
That’s not the case with analytic 
truths, according to Kant. If 
you understand the meaning of 
“poodle” and “dog,” you won’t 
still wonder whether all poodles 
are dogs.
]
] Kant believed that if he could 
convince you that mathematics 
involved synthetic a priori 
claims, then you would have 
no reason to argue against the 
idea that philosophy involves 
synthetic a priori claims as well. 
In other words, Kant saw his 
argument for the existence of the 
synthetic a priori as providing 
proof of philosophy as a well-
founded discipline, on a par with 
mathematics.

Lecture 12  Do We Have Innate Knowledge?

103
A PRIORI SYNTHETIC TRUTHS
^
^ Suppose you agree with Kant 
that we do have at least some a 
priori knowledge. Where does that 
knowledge come from? How do we 
know, for example, that all equilateral 
triangles are equiangular—
particularly because we can know 
that without physically examining 
any equilateral triangles?
^
^ The point of introducing the 
synthetic a priori is to reject one way 
of answering that question. For the 
empiricist, one thing that would be 
acceptable would be to say that you 
can have a priori knowledge as long 
as it is knowledge derived from the 
meaning of words or concepts. So, 
as long as all a priori knowledge is 
analytic, then it would be okay for the 
empiricist.
^
^ Once you introduce the synthetic 
a priori, however, it is no longer as 
easy for the empiricist to explain 
where that knowledge comes from—
the synthetic a priori knowledge 
that doesn’t ultimately come from 
knowledge of meaning.
^
^ So, where does this knowledge come 
from? Let’s examine three answers.
^
^ The first suggestion for where our 
a priori knowledge comes from 
is a form of rationalism. It’s less 
extreme than Descartes’s rationalism, 
because it doesn’t claim that we learn 
everything through reason. Instead, 
these more modest rationalists 
just suggest that it is reason that 
explains how we learn the a priori 
synthetic truths of mathematics and 
philosophy. These modest rationalists 
suggest that we recognize those truths 
through the use of a rational faculty, 
or faculty of reason. There are two 
big problems with this idea.
]
] The first problem has to do with 
how the faculty of reason comes to 
know the things it knows. Modest 
rationalists like to suggest that 
reason “recognizes” or “perceives” 
a priori synthetic truths. But this is 
just a metaphor, and it isn’t helpful. 
Modest rationalists explicitly reject 
the notion that a brain-based 
explanation of how we come to 
know a priori synthetic truths is 
something we ought to seek. That’s 
just not a strategy that is worth 
pursuing.
]
] The second problem is that modest 
rationalists are very unclear about 
what a faculty of reason might 
be. The one thing that modest 
rationalists do seem to suggest is 
that the faculty of reason can’t 
just be a mechanism or collection 
of mechanisms in the brain. And 
rejecting an appeal to brain-based 
mechanisms for understanding 
human knowledge isn’t a promising 
explanatory. But even if you’re 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 12  Do We Have Innate Knowledge?

104
not opposed in principle to 
explanations that ignore the role of 
the brain and brain mechanisms in 
knowledge, certainly you shouldn’t 
be satisfied with a name that stands 
for nothing. And unfortunately, in 
the case of modest rationalism, it 
seems that that’s all we have. Just a 
label—the faculty of reason—with 
no further detail about what such a 
thing might be.
^
^ Modest rationalism doesn’t seem 
very plausible. Luckily, the other two 
explanatory strategies—the innate 
strategy and the language strategy—
are based on mechanisms in the 
brain. Furthermore, the strategies 
are compatible with each other, so 
we can appeal to either one or both 
of the strategies to help explain our 
knowledge of a priori synthetic truths.
]
] The innate strategy involves 
innate brain mechanisms. Such 
mechanisms almost certainly play a 
role in our knowledge of basic facts 
about numbers.
]
] According to the language strategy, 
mathematical thinking is a result of 
our use of language.
^
^ Both of these suggestions are 
plausible. The good news is that we 
don’t need to choose between them; 
we can accept that both innate brain 
structures and language play a role in 
synthetic a priori knowledge.
T
he evidence that innate mechanisms in the brain 
play a role in our knowledge of mathematics 
is strong. Beginning in the 1980s, developmental 
psychologists introduced what became known as 
the violation-of-expectation paradigm to investigate 
the innate cognitive abilities of preverbal children, 
even very young infants. Using that research 
technique, researchers have been able to establish 
that very young infants—as young as three or four 
days old—have a number of innate mental abilities 
that are relevant to our discussion of a priori 
synthetic knowledge.

105
N
ewborns have the ability to recognize when 
different collections of objects have differing 
numbers of objects. Psychologists refer to this as the 
ability to subitize, and developmental psychologists 
suggest that this ability is evidence that infants 
have an innate conception of number. In fact, by 
the age of a few months, babies behave as if they 
have an intuitive 
understanding 
of very simple 
arithmetic 
operations, such 
as 1 + 1 = 2.
O
ne of the pioneers of the suggestion that our 
ability to think abstractly is a result of our use 
of language was Soviet psychologist Alexander 
Luria. In a groundbreaking series of studies, he 
interviewed a number of Central Asian peasants and 
found that the ability to think and reason abstractly 
depended on the level of language learning that the 
peasants had attained.

R
esearch conducted by cognitive neuroscientist 
Stanislas Dehaene shows that there are at 
least two separate brain systems responsible for 
mathematical cognition: one involves approximate 
arithmetic and the other is employed when we 
compute exact arithmetic. Dehaene suggests that 
this second system is tied to the language that a 
person has learned.
This indicates that the best explanation of 
our a priori synthetic knowledge—such as our 
knowledge of mathematics—might involve both 
innate brain structures that provide us with the 
most fundamental concepts that we depend on 
for such knowledge and structures contained 
within our language that allow us to build on those 
fundamental concepts.

How Deduction 
Contributes to 
Knowledge
M
uch of what we know is not something that 
we’ve experienced directly. In many cases, what 
we know is inferred. In fact, as in the case of 
the foundationalist position, many philosophers 
think that inference is essential to the structure of 
knowledge.

109
DEDUCTION VERSUS INDUCTION
^
^ Deduction involves inference based 
on the purely logical relationships 
that hold among the steps that make 
up the inference. A classic example 
is the syllogism, a form of inference 
that Aristotle studied more than 
2,000 years ago. This syllogism is a 
paradigmatic example of deductive 
inference:
1	 All men are mortal.
2	 Socrates is a man.
3	 Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
^
^ Consider this significant attribute 
of the inference. There is no way 
for the steps of the inference—what 
philosophers call the premises—to 
be true and the conclusion to be 
false. The conclusion, in other words, 
necessarily follows from the premises.
^
^ This is the central attribute of 
deduction. A well-formed deductive 
inference is one in which the 
conclusion necessarily follows 
from the premises. Such well-
formed inferences are referred to as 
deductively valid.
^
^ This is a remarkable property 
of deductive inference. It offers 
a guarantee that you can be 
sure, purely based on the form 
of the inference, that if you have 
true premises, you’ll have a true 
conclusion.
^
^ This remarkable power, however, 
comes with two significant costs.
]
] Deductive validity gives us a 
guarantee that if our premises are 
true, our conclusion will also be 
true, but if any of the premises 
are false, then all bets are off—the 
conclusion could be false, but it 
could also be true.
]
] The conclusion of a deductively 
valid argument will always contain 
no more information than the 
premises of the argument. In 
fact, the conclusion of a deductive 
argument generally contains 
dramatically less information than 
the premises of that argument. You 
could actually think of this as the 
function of a deductive argument: 
Its conclusion allows you to focus 
on the particular implication of 
the information contained in the 
premises that interests you.
^
^ If what you want is an argument 
whose conclusion contains 
information that is not contained in 
the premises, then what you want 
is a nondeductive argument. There 
are a number of different types of 
nondeductive arguments, but we’ll 
focus on inductive arguments.
^
^ Inductive arguments are ones 
whose premises merely make their 
conclusion highly probable. Consider 
the following argument.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 13  How Deduction Contributes to Knowledge

110
1	 In the past, I have often observed 
cardinals, and they have always 
been red.
2	 Therefore, the next time I observe 
a cardinal, it will also be red.
^
^ You can think of the first step of the 
argument as a shorthand for a list 
of all of the individual occasions on 
which you’ve observed cardinals and 
they’ve been red. If you think of that 
step in this way, then the support 
for the conclusion of the inductive 
argument—that the next cardinal you 
see will also be red—will presumably 
be stronger the more observations of 
cardinals you’ve had in the past.
^
^ This fact about inductive arguments 
allows us to appreciate the key aspect 
about them that distinguishes them 
from deductive arguments: Inductive 
arguments can involve weaker or 
stronger support for their conclusion. 
The strength of inductive arguments 
depends on the level of support 
that their premises provide for the 
conclusion, whereas deductively 
valid arguments with true premises 
always guarantee the truth of their 
conclusion.
^
^ The trade-off for the fact that 
inductive arguments cannot 
guarantee their conclusions is that 
inductive arguments can involve 
conclusions that provide information 
not contained in the premises. In 
fact, any generalization in science—
for example, that all electrons have 
less mass than any proton—is the 
conclusion of an inductive argument. 
This is because any general statement 
would necessarily go beyond the 
individual observations on which it 
must be based.
DEDUCTIVE ARGUMENTS
^
^ Deductive arguments are central to 
both foundationalist and coherentist 
internalist theories.
]
] In the case of Descartes’s form 
of internalist foundationalism, 
deduction is the only way in which 
knowledge can be supported by 
the foundational beliefs you have. 
This is because Descartes required 
that knowledge be infallible, and 
only deductive inference provides 
a guarantee that its conclusions 
are true. But even other forms of 
fallible foundationalism still regard 
deductive inference as an important 
source of knowledge.
]
] It’s not exactly clear what goes into 
the relation of coherence. However, 
one of the components would have 
to involve something like logical 
consistency, and logical consistency 
involves deductive inference.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 13  How Deduction Contributes to Knowledge

111
^
^ In other words, particularly for 
the internalist, deductive inference 
is of central importance. It is 
surprising, then, that philosophers 
have often been blind to a number 
of complications having to do with 
deductive inference. We’ll focus on 
three representative problems.
T
he logical connectives used in deductive reasoning 
are defined in terms of how they affect the truth 
values of sentences.
If you add the logical “not” to a true sentence, you get a 
false sentence. And if you add the logical “not” to a false 
sentence, the result is true.
The logical “and” joins two sentences. The resulting 
compound sentence is true only when both sentences 
joined by the “and” are true. In all other cases, the “and” 
is false.
The logical “or” is also used to join two sentences, but in 
the case of the “or,” the resulting sentence is true as long 
as at least one of the components is true. The sentence is 
also true when both are true. This is because the logical 
“or” is called the nonexclusive “or.” That means if a 
logician wants to use “or” to mean “one or the other, but 
not both,” then he or she explicitly has to stipulate that.
The “if-then,” also called a conditional statement, also 
joins two sentences—like the logical “and” and the logical 
“or.” Unlike these two, however, the position of the 
sentences joined by the “if-then” matters. Let’s call the 
“if” sentence the antecedent (A) and the “then” sentence 
the consequent (C). If A, then C is only false when the 
antecedent A is true and the consequent C is false. In all 
other cases, the “if-then” is true.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 13  How Deduction Contributes to Knowledge

112
^
^ Despite the fact that some of these 
difficulties have been studied since the 
1960s, psychologists and philosophers 
still have differing explanations for 
why these problems in deductive 
reasoning persist. However, there is 
universal agreement that the existence 
of these difficulties provides proof 
that humans are not naturally gifted 
at abstract deductive reasoning. Even 
highly intelligent people make very 
basic mistakes when they attempt to 
think deductively.
^
^ An example demonstrating the 
fact that humans are not innately 
strong abstract reasoners is the 
Wason selection task, a psychological 
experiment first conducted by 
psychologist Peter Wason in the mid-
1960s. Here’s a description from an 
article cowritten by Wason and his 
collaborator Philip Johnson-Laird:
b
bYou are presented with four cards 
showing, respectively, “A,” “D,” “4,” 
“7,” and you know from previous 
experience that every card, of which 
these are a subset, has a letter on 
one side and a number on the other 
side. You are then given this rule 
about the four cards in front of you: 
If a card has a vowel on one side, 
then it has an even number on the 
other side. Next you are told: Your 
task is to say which of the cards you 
need to turn over in order to find out 
whether the rule is true or false.”
^
^ As Johnson-Laird and Wason 
emphasize,
b
bVery few highly intelligent [people] 
get the answer right spontaneously; 
some take a considerable time to 
grasp it; a small minority even 
dispute its correctness, or at least 
remain puzzled by it.
^
^ In their words, this is the answer to 
the selection task:
b
bThe most frequent answers are “A 
and 4” and “only A.” They are both 
wrong. The right answer is “A and 
7” because if these two stimuli were 
to occur on the same card, then the 
rule would be false but otherwise it 
would be true.
^
^ The results of the Wason selection 
task are some of the most widely 
replicated in the history of modern 
psychology. When presented with 
abstract problems testing their 
intuitive grasp of “if-then” deductive 
reasoning, only less than 25 percent—
in some experiments as few as 7 
percent—of people complete the 
selection task correctly.
^
^ Later experiments have found that 
the subject matter can make an 
enormous difference in how well 
people do in completing the selection 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 13  How Deduction Contributes to Knowledge

113
task. The issue of why and how 
different versions of the selection task 
can yield such different results still 
has researchers puzzled.
^
^ But what is unquestioned is that 
humans are abject failures, by and 
large, at the abstract version of the 
selection task. And given that for 
formal logic the content of the rules 
shouldn’t matter—only their structure 
should matter—this shows that 
humans are not naturally gifted at 
deductive reasoning.
^
^ According to further research 
conducted by Wason, it turns out 
that humans are not all that good at 
applying the rules governing “or” and 
“and” statements either.
^
^ If we’re not all that good at 
deductive logical reasoning, why 
would traditional internalists—both 
foundationalists and coherentists—
make deductive logical reasoning an 
essential component of justification? 
If the goal of epistemology is to 
explain how we have knowledge, 
rather than to demonstrate that 
we lack knowledge, then requiring 
deductive logical ability in order 
to have knowledge seems like a 
bad strategy.
^
^ When most people think about 
themselves, they likely tend to think 
that they’re actually pretty good at 
logical reasoning. In fact, one of the 
surprising aspects of Wason’s research 
is that they contradict our self-image 
as strong logical reasoners.
^
^ If many of us are in fact so poor at 
reasoning deductively, why are we 
not more aware of that fact? The 
answer can be found in one of the 
most famous social psychological 
experiments of the last quarter 
century.
^
^ The experiment was performed by 
a professor of psychology at Cornell 
University, David Dunning, and a 
graduate student in psychology, Justin 
Kruger. Their article reporting on the 
experiment, “Unskilled and Unaware 
of It,” which appeared in 1999 in 
the Journal of Personality and Social 
Psychology, has racked up more than 
4,000 citations on Google Scholar.
^
^ In the version of their experiment that 
is relevant to deductive reasoning, 
Dunning and Kruger gave a group 
of Cornell undergraduate psychology 
students a 20-item logical reasoning 
test drawn from study questions for 
the LSAT.
^
^ On average, the students placed 
themselves in the 66th percentile on 
the logical reasoning test. Remember 
that the average has to be the 50th 
percentile.
^
^ Dunning and Kruger tried to figure 
out the source of this misdiagnosis 
of logical ability, so they divided the 
test takers into quartiles and found 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 13  How Deduction Contributes to Knowledge

114
that the top 25 percent of the students 
actually underestimated their 
performance on the test.
^
^ What accounted for the overestimate 
of logical ability on the part of the 
student participants was the worst 
performers. In particular, the bottom 
25 percent of the students, who scored 
on average in the 12th percentile, 
believed themselves to be in the 68th 
percentile of all test takers.
^
^ Dunning and Kruger suggest that 
“those with limited knowledge in 
a domain suffer a dual burden: 
Not only do they reach mistaken 
conclusions and make regrettable 
errors, but their incompetence robs 
them of the ability to realize it.” 
This phenomenon has become so 
widely recognized that it has entered 
the literature as the Dunning-
Kruger effect.
B
oth internalist foundationalists and coherentists 
require deductive reasoning as a central 
feature of how we are supposed to construct 
our knowledge. However, we are not only bad 
at deductive reasoning, but also insensitive to 
what poor logical reasoners we are. This is a bad 
combination for internalist theorists.
According to the externalist, there is no requirement 
that you can know something only if you can 
support your knowledge on the basis of reasons 
you have access to. That requirement—coupled 
with the suggestion that the way you must support 
your knowledge will at least sometimes involve 
deductive inference—is what leads to problems for 
the internalist.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 13  How Deduction Contributes to Knowledge

115
Without that requirement, the externalist faces 
no challenge due to the fact that our deductive 
reasoning skills are not as good as we intuitively 
assumed. In this way, the externalist theorist is able 
to have a more clearheaded assessment of our 
actual reasoning abilities.
A consideration of deductive reasoning suggests at 
least some support for an externalist theory.

LECTURE 14
Hume’s Attack 
on Induction
T
here is a long philosophical tradition of questioning 
whether inductive inference is at all useful in 
generating knowledge. We can also ask the separate 
question of whether humans are actually good 
inductive reasoners. This means that we have two 
challenges to consider: whether inductive inferences 
are ones that we should rely on in increasing our 
knowledge and whether we humans are in fact 
able to reason inductively in ways that increase our 
knowledge. This lecture focuses on the first question 
while the next tackles the second.

118
INDUCTIVE ARGUMENTS
^
^ Recall that two of the main features 
of deduction are that it is certain and 
it can’t add to the information that 
we already have. Induction differs 
from deduction along both of these 
dimensions.
^
^ First, induction is not certain. 
Inductive arguments involve 
probability. The point of introducing 
the notion of probability is to be able 
to discuss events that may not be 
certain—events that have a chance of 
occurring but also a chance of failing 
to occur.
^
^ Suppose you have a friend who 
smokes a pack of cigarettes a day. 
You tell him that if he keeps that up, 
he’s likely to develop serious health 
problems and to die prematurely. He 
responds by saying, “My grandfather 
smoked a pack of cigarettes a day, 
never had any health issues, and lived 
to be 100 years old.”
^
^ An inductive argument—even a 
good one—doesn’t guarantee that its 
conclusion will apply in every case.
^
^ The argument you give to your friend 
would look like this:
1	 Many of those people who smoked 
a pack of cigarettes a day or more 
developed serious health problems 
and died prematurely.
2	 Therefore, if you smoke a pack 
of cigarettes a day or more, you 
will likely develop serious health 
problems and die prematurely.
^
^ Much of the strength of this argument 
will depend on the support you have 
for the first claim. And that support 
will require at least two things.
]
] Presumably, the larger the 
percentage of people who develop 
health problems when smoking, 
the stronger the link is between the 
data you’ve gathered about smoking 
in general and the chance that 
your friend, in particular, will also 
suffer negative health effects from 
smoking.
]
] The more evidence you’ve gathered 
that links smoking to poor health, 
the better the support for your first 
claim will be.
^
^ Suppose you’re satisfied that you have 
good evidence for your first claim. 
Unlike in the case of a deductive 
argument, even an inductive 
argument that seems strong doesn’t 
guarantee the truth of the conclusion 
given the truth of the premises.
^
^ At best, your first claim just tells 
you that you have a great deal of 
evidence that there has been a 
strong connection observed between 
smoking and poor health. This 
observed connection, however, 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 14  Hume’s Attack on Induction

119
cannot guarantee that there actually 
is a connection between smoking 
and ill health, nor can it guarantee, 
for example, that smoking causes ill 
health. It merely makes it likely that 
such a connection is real and that 
such a causal relationship exists.
^
^ This is the first complication: The 
truth of the premises of an inductive 
argument do not guarantee the truth 
of the argument’s conclusion, even 
when the argument enjoys a great 
deal of evidential support.
^
^ Here’s the second complication. 
In almost all inductive argument 
conclusions, there will be an element 
of probability in the statement of the 
conclusion. For example, you argued 
that your friend will likely develop 
serious health complications and die 
prematurely. The problem here is 
that your inductive evidence could be 
strong and the conclusion could even 
be true, but your friend still might not 
develop serious health complications 
and die prematurely.
^
^ Sometimes the less likely event does 
in fact occur. This means that it is 
much harder to demonstrate that the 
conclusion of an inductive argument 
is false. Suppose you are told only that 
a certain event is likely to happen—or 
even highly likely to happen. The 
mere fact that it doesn’t happen on 
a single occasion doesn’t actually 
demonstrate that the claim was false. 
It’s only by looking at vast amounts 
of data that you could assess whether 
the estimate of the likelihood was 
accurate or not. And if you’re dealing 
with a one-off event, that’s not always 
terribly helpful.
^
^ Given the problems with inductive 
arguments, you might suggest that 
we simply stop dealing with them. 
In some ways, this is a typical 
philosophical reaction. When you 
read most works of philosophy, 
all you’ll encounter are deductive 
arguments, not inductive ones. 
The reason for this is at least in 
part that philosophers prefer the 
clean simplicity and elegance of 
deductive arguments to the messiness 
introduced by inductive arguments.
^
^ The reason inductive arguments 
are useful, however, is that—unlike 
deduction—inductive arguments can 
actually add new information to the 
information that we already have.
I
nductive arguments 
are much less 
straightforward and 
much more difficult 
to deal with than 
deductive arguments.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 14  Hume’s Attack on Induction

120
^
^ Suppose you notice, on a number 
of occasions, that whenever you 
light a campfire, smoke rises from 
the logs. You find yourself hiking in 
the woods during a forest fire alert 
and see, over the rise of the next 
hill, smoke wafting up. You think, 
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire, and 
head back to your car to alert the 
park rangers. That thought goes 
beyond any experience you’ve ever 
had. All of the experiences you’ve 
had have been of particular events, 
including particular campfires, so 
all of your evidence has been of the 
form of specific camping trips and 
campfires.
^
^ So, that general claim—that where 
there’s smoke, there’s fire—is 
new information. It’s not actually 
information you’ve ever simply 
perceived, although it is based on 
information that you’ve perceived—
namely the information about 
your previous experiences with fire 
and smoke.
^
^ That’s the power of induction. It can 
allow you to derive new information 
from your existing storehouse of 
experience. And then, using that new 
information you’ve derived, induction 
allows you potentially to predict 
future observations or to manipulate 
future events.
HUME’S INDUCTIVE CHALLENGE
^
^ Given the great power and usefulness 
of inductive arguments, it’s no 
wonder philosophers have had a 
great interest in showing that those 
arguments work and how they can 
be improved.
^
^ One of the great challenges faced by 
those who attempt to explain and 
defend the use of inductive inference 
was given by David Hume in a series 
of works. In the first of those works, A 
Treatise of Human Nature, he introduced 
an attack on induction that became 
one of the most influential arguments 
in the history of philosophy.
^
^ The goal of Hume’s argument is 
to show that, despite its power and 
usefulness, inductive arguments are 
not in fact based on reason at all. 
According to Hume, the correct 
conclusion to draw about induction is 
that it provides us with no reason for 
our beliefs or actions at all!
^
^ How does Hume establish such a 
seemingly radical conclusion?
^
^ He begins by noting that in order for 
inductive arguments to be successful, 
the uniformity principle—which says 
that unobserved instances resemble 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 14  Hume’s Attack on Induction

121
observed instances—must be true. 
The uniformity principle requires 
this: For an inductive argument to 
be successful, past performance must 
at least resemble the future results in 
ways that make generalizations about 
those future results possible.
^
^ Hume’s uniformity principle seems 
to be extremely plausible. Inductive 
reasoning can only work as long as 
the unobserved cases that you’re 
trying to predict resemble the 
observed cases on which you base 
your argument.
T
he uniformity principle is one of the basic 
assumptions at the root of scientific inquiry. As 
astrophysicist Brian Greene noted, 
Science is not describing a 
universe out there, and we’re 
separate entities …. We’re 
part of that universe, we’re 
made of the same stuff as 
that universe, of ingredients 
that behave according to 
the same laws as they do 
elsewhere in the universe.
^
^ Hume’s argument is as follows:
1	 In order for someone to have 
reason to believe any matter-of-
fact claim about the unobserved, 
he or she must first have reason 
to believe that the uniformity 
principle is true. To make this 
claim plausible, it would help 
to think from an internalist 
perspective. The uniformity 
principle is neither self-evident 
nor something we can know 
on the basis of immediate 
experience. Therefore, if you’re 
an internalist—whether a 
foundationalist or a coherentist—
Hume’s first claim seems very 
plausible.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 14  Hume’s Attack on Induction

122
I
f you’re an internalist, then you think that 
everything you have reason to believe has to be 
supported by something else you also have reason 
to believe, with a few potential exceptions.
If you’re a coherentist, then there are no exceptions; 
everything you have reason to believe has to be 
supported by its coherence with everything else you 
have reason to believe.
If you’re a foundationalist, then the exceptions 
are the foundational beliefs. Typically, for 
foundationalists, this would include things that are 
self-evident or things you believe on the basis of 
immediate experience.
2	 All claims are either what Hume 
calls relations-of-ideas claims or 
matter-of-fact claims. Matter-of-
fact claims can be either true or 
false. Relations-of-ideas claims 
are made true by the concepts, or 
ideas, they involve; they are claims 
you can know without going out 
into the world and checking. The 
claim that all statements can be 
divided into one of these types, 
sometimes called Hume’s fork, 
seems at least somewhat plausible.
3	 The uniformity principle is not a 
relations-of-ideas claim. There is 
nothing about the meaning of the 
ideas involved in the claim that 
unobserved instances resemble 
observed instances that would 
guarantee the truth of that claim. 
If all claims are either relations-
of-ideas claims or matter-of-fact 
claims and if the uniformity 
principle is not a relations-of-
ideas claim, then the uniformity 
principle must be a matter-of-
fact claim.
4	 Because the uniformity principle 
says that unobserved instances 
resemble observed instances, that 
means the uniformity principle is a 
claim about the unobserved.
5	 Because the uniformity principle is 
itself a matter-of-fact claim about 
the unobserved, that means that 
in order for you to have reason 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 14  Hume’s Attack on Induction

123
B
ecause pretty 
much all of 
science depends on 
inductive reasoning, 
in a nutshell Hume’s 
conclusion means 
that we have no good 
reason to believe any 
of the information 
science gives us.
to believe that the uniformity 
principle is true, you must already 
have reason to believe that the 
uniformity principle is true.
^
^ Because the support for the uniformity 
principle comes from the uniformity 
principle itself, the justification for 
the uniformity principle is viciously 
circular. And if that’s the case, then 
Hume has the conclusion that he’s 
after: We have no good, noncircular 
reason for believing in the conclusions 
of inductive arguments.
^
^ Hume’s conclusion is devastating for 
our everyday beliefs. Hume himself 
emphasizes that the results of his 
conclusion mean that we don’t have 
good reason to believe that food and 
drink will nourish us rather than 
poisoning us—or even that the sun 
will rise tomorrow as it’s always done 
in the past.
^
^ Clearly, this is a terrible result. If 
there is any way to avoid accepting 
the force of Hume’s argument, we 
should see if we can seek it out.
^
^ One strategy for rejecting Hume’s 
argument is to attack the first 
premise: that in order for you to have 
reason to believe any matter-of-fact 
claim about the unobserved, you 
must first have reason to believe the 
uniformity principle is true.
^
^ This claim is not obvious. What is 
obvious is that for you to have good 
reason to believe the result of an 
inductive argument, the uniformity 
principle has to be true. But that’s 
a far cry from Hume’s claim, which 
is that for you to have reason to 
believe in the result of your inductive 
inference, you have to have reason to 
believe that the uniformity principle 
is true.
^
^ If you’re an externalist, you’ll 
reject Hume’s claim. Just because 
our having reason to believe in 
the conclusions of our inductive 
inferences requires the truth of the 
uniformity principle, that doesn’t 
mean we have to give any thought to 
the uniformity principle itself.

The Raven Paradox 
and New Riddle 
of Induction
A
s introduced in the previous lecture, David Hume 
raised skeptical worries about the rationality of 
believing on the basis of inductive inference, and 
his argument—though ingenious—can be rejected 
in a variety of ways. There are problems involved 
with inductive inference that are not as easily solved 
as Hume’s argument, but thinking about a solution 
to these problems provides valuable lessons about 
inductive inference.

127
HEMPEL’S PARADOX
^
^ Hempel’s paradox was formulated 
in the 1940s by German philosopher 
Carl Hempel. It is often referred to as 
the raven paradox because Hempel 
formulated it by discussing the 
claim that all ravens are black and 
considering what types of experiences 
would support that claim.
^
^ Consider the claim that all ravens are 
black. If you want to find evidence 
for it, presumably the best way would 
be to find all the ravens you can and 
show that all the ravens you’ve been 
able to find so far have been black. 
Furthermore, it’s intuitively plausible 
that the more black ravens you’ve 
found, the stronger your evidence is 
for the claim.
^
^ Logically, the claim that all ravens 
are black is equivalent to the claim 
that all non-black things are non-
ravens. “Equivalent” here means 
that the two statements are true in 
exactly the same circumstances.
^
^ Whenever the “all ravens” 
claim is true, so is the “all 
non-black things” claim. 
And whenever the “all 
ravens” claim is false, so is 
the “all non-black things” 
claim. And this means 
that any evidence for 
the “all ravens” claim will also count, 
logically, as evidence for the “all non-
black things” claim—and vice versa.
^
^ The problem is that you can get a ton 
of evidence for the claim that all non-
black things are non-ravens without 
ever seeing a single raven. Suppose, for 
example, that you’re in a factory that 
mass-produces white printer paper. 
Each sheet of paper is both non-black 
and not a raven, so each sheet of paper 
provides evidence for the claim that all 
non-black things are non-ravens.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 15  The Raven Paradox and New Riddle of Induction

128
^
^ But remember that the claim that all 
non-black things are non-ravens is 
equivalent to the claim that all ravens 
are black and that evidence for one 
claim should therefore count logically 
as evidence for the other. But this 
means that you can acquire a great 
deal of evidence in support of the 
claim that all ravens are black without 
ever laying eyes on a single raven!
^
^ Also, remember that the more 
instances you have that support your 
claim, the stronger your evidence is 
supposed to be. So, it would seem that 
you can gather stronger evidence for 
the claim that all ravens are black by 
flipping through a ream of printer 
paper than you can by observing a 
few black ravens. This is absurd!
^
^ The raven paradox demonstrates 
that there is more to the way that 
inductive arguments provide evidence 
for their conclusions than we can 
express using logic alone. Beyond 
this, though, philosophers disagree 
about the best way to deal with 
Hempel’s raven paradox.
^
^ One solution, proposed by 
philosophers Israel Scheffler and 
Nelson Goodman, drew on a 
famous insight of Karl Popper’s. 
Popper argued that in science, 
evidence against a hypothesis, called 
disconfirmation, is much more 
important than evidence for that 
hypothesis, called confirmation.
^
^ Scheffler and Goodman suggested 
that we shouldn’t just focus on the 
fact that because the claim that all 
ravens are black and the claim that all 
non-black things are non-ravens are 
logically equivalent, both an instance 
of a black raven and an instance of a 
non-black non-raven would offer some 
confirmation for either claim. Instead, 
we should look at the claims that the 
instances of the black raven and the 
non-black non-raven can disconfirm.
^
^ The instance of a black raven 
confirms the claim that all ravens 
are black, and it also provides reason 
to reject the claim that all ravens 
are non-black. The instance of a 
non-black non-raven, however, is 
compatible both with the claim that 
all ravens are black and with the 
claim that all ravens are not-black.
^
^ Scheffler and Goodman characterize 
this difference by saying that the 
instance of a black raven selectively 
confirms the claim that all ravens are 
black, while the instance of a non-
black non-raven doesn’t selectively 
confirm that claim.
^
^ Although we weren’t able to deal with 
Hempel’s paradox quite as easily as 
Hume’s challenge to induction, there 
is nevertheless a pretty tidy solution 
that we can appeal to.

129
GOODMAN’S PROBLEM
^
^ Goodman’s problem for induction is 
often referred to as the new riddle of 
induction (the old riddle of induction 
is Hume’s) or as the grue problem.
^
^ Goodman begins by defining a 
description-word, “grue.” The 
philosophical term for a description-
word is predicate; it is basically a 
term used to describe something. For 
example, “tall” and “wears glasses” 
are predicates. And, after Goodman 
introduced the term in his 1955 work 
Fact, Fiction, and Forecast, so is “grue.”
^
^ Goodman defines grue by saying that
b
bit applies to all things examined 
before [some future time] t just in 
case they are green but to other things 
[after that future time] just in case 
they are blue. Then at time t we 
have, for each evidence statement 
asserting that a given emerald is 
green, a parallel evidence statement 
asserting that that emerald is grue. 
And the statements that emerald 
a is grue, that emerald b is grue, 
and so on, will each confirm the 
general hypothesis that all emeralds 
are grue. Thus according to our 
definition, the prediction is that all 
emeralds subsequently examined will 
be green and the prediction that all 
will be grue are alike confirmed by 
evidence statements describing the 
same observations. But if an emerald 
subsequently examined is grue, it is 
blue and hence not green.
^
^ Let’s give a slightly more concrete 
example by defining grue as 
something that, whenever we 
examine it before midnight on 
January 1, 2100, appears green, but 
that were we to examine it on or after 
midnight on January 1, 2100, would 
appear blue.
^
^ Because of the way we’ve defined 
grue, all of the experience that we’ve 
had so far of green things is also 
evidence that those things are grue.
^
^ In particular, the following two 
statements are both true:
I	 All observed emeralds are green.
II	 All observed emeralds are grue.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 15  The Raven Paradox and New Riddle of Induction

130
^
^ If observed correlations provide 
us with reasonable beliefs about 
unobserved cases, we have equal 
reason to believe the following 
two claims:
I'	 The first emerald observed on or 
after midnight, January 1, 2100, 
will be green. (Let’s call this the 
green-prediction.)
II'	The first emerald observed on or 
after midnight, January 1, 2100, 
will be grue. (Let’s call this the 
grue-prediction.)
^
^ But now we have a problem. Because 
of how we’ve defined grue, the grue-
prediction implies the following:
II"	The first emerald observed after 
t will be blue. (Let’s call this the 
blue-prediction.)
^
^ Obviously, the blue-prediction 
contradicts the green-prediction.
^
^ So, by introducing grue, Goodman 
demonstrates that it seems induction 
can be used to support outlandish 
beliefs—such as the belief that 
emeralds will appear blue when 
observed on or after January 1, 2100. 
And induction can even be used to 
support contradictory claims. This is 
because, by using grue, we’ve shown 
that both the claim “All emeralds will 
appear green when observed on or 
after January 1, 2100” and the claim 
“All emeralds will appear blue when 
observed on or after January 1, 2100” 
are equally well supported by the 
evidence.
^
^ Goodman doesn’t think we can find 
a solution to the grue problem by 
focusing on the logic of the predicates 
themselves. Instead, he thinks the 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 15  The Raven Paradox and New Riddle of Induction

131
best way to distinguish between the 
predicates we want to employ and the 
ones we don’t is to focus on our own 
psychology. How do we use predicates 
in formulating inductive arguments? 
Goodman thinks it’s the answer to 
this question that provides the key to 
solving his new riddle of induction.
^
^ Goodman observes that the claims 
we want to test through induction 
don’t exist individually, in a vacuum. 
Instead, those claims are often related 
to a number of other claims. And one 
of the ways in which different claims 
are related to each other is that we 
often employ the same predicates to 
formulate them. Goodman describes 
those predicates that are used in a wide 
variety of claims that we test through 
inductive inference as entrenched.
^
^ Now we have a way to distinguish 
between green and grue: Green is 
very well entrenched while grue is not 
entrenched at all. 
^
^ Green and grue conflict with 
each other because they support 
contradictory predictions. So, if we 
have to choose between two claims 
that we’re testing against the evidence 
and one of those claims involves the 
predicate “green” while the other 
involves the predicate “grue,” then 
Goodman says that we should choose 
the claim that involves the better-
entrenched predicate, “green.” In this 
case, the predicate “green” overrides 
the predicate “grue.”
^
^ This gives Goodman a way to 
characterize the kinds of predicates 
he thinks make good candidates 
for inductive inference—and offer 
a solution to the grue problem. It’s 
the predicates that override other 
predicates that conflict with it without 
being overridden themselves. He calls 
those predicates projectible.
^
^ Goodman’s solution to the grue 
problem might seem too easy. 
What justification could we give for 
characterizing certain descriptions, 
such as “green,” as projectible? 
Why are others, such as “grue,” 
non-projectible? Wasn’t the whole 
point of Goodman’s puzzle that 
both descriptions fit our evidence 
equally well?
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 15  The Raven Paradox and New Riddle of Induction

132
Bayes’s Theorem
^
^ One way to defend Goodman’s 
type of solution is to see it 
as part of a larger theory of 
inductive inference. That’s 
the strategy a number of 
contemporary philosophers 
pursue, by suggesting that 
the solution to Goodman’s 
grue problem is just a special 
application of a rule of inference 
known as Bayes’s theorem, 
named for the reverend Thomas 
Bayes, who formulated the 
theorem.
^
^ The insight that Bayes captured 
was that when we learn 
new information about the 
probability of the occurrence 
of some event, we often already 
have information about how 
likely that event is. Bayes’s 
theorem presents a precise 
mathematical formula for how 
to interpret the new information 
about likelihoods in light 
of the information that we 
already have.
^
^ Suppose that your doctor 
suggested that you get tested 
for a very rare but very deadly 
disease. Let’s say it’s so rare that 
only one in 10,000 people ever 
get it. The test for the disease is 
99 percent reliable. A few days 
later, you get a call from the 
doctor, saying that you have this 
rare deadly disease. How should 
you feel about your chances of 
actually having the disease?
^
^ You might think that you have 
a 99 percent chance of having 
the disease. But you’d be wrong. 
And this is where Bayes’s 
theorem comes in.
^
^ Imagine that we have a random 
sample of 100,000 people. One 
in 10,000 of those people will 
have the disease, so that means 
that 10 will have it and 99,990 
won’t have it.
^
^ The test is supposed to be 99 
percent reliable. For simplicity’s 
sake, let’s say that means that for 
every 100 people who actually 
do have the disease, the test only 
gets it wrong one time—called 
a false negative—and that for 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 15  The Raven Paradox and New Riddle of Induction

133
every 100 people who actually 
do not have the disease, the test 
again only gets it wrong one 
time—called a false positive.
^
^ In other words, one out of 100 
people that the test says doesn’t 
have the disease actually does 
have it, and one out of 100 
people that the test says does 
have the disease actually doesn’t 
have it.
^
^ That means that out of our 
sample of 100,000 people, 
the test will say that all 10 of 
those who do have the disease 
actually do have it. However, 
it will also—wrongly—say 
that one percent of those who 
don’t have the disease actually 
do have it. That means it will 
falsely diagnose 1,000 people as 
having the disease when they 
actually don’t have it.
^
^ Let’s put those numbers 
together. That 99-percent-
reliable test diagnoses 1,010 
people out of 100,000 as having 
the rare deadly disease, but only 
10 of those people actually have 
the disease, so your chances of 
having the disease—even if that 
99-percent-reliable test says you 
have it—are actually only 10 out 
of 1,010, or about one percent.
^
^ This example shows the power 
of using what we already know 
about the world—called prior 
probability—to interpret any 
new information that we learn. 
In this example, the prior 
probability has to do with just 
how very infrequently that 
deadly disease occurs. Without 
taking the prior probability 
into account, when you get the 
bad news of the test results for 
the disease, you would think 
that you are almost certainly 
a goner. Actually, though, 
99 out of 100 people who get 
similar bad news go on to live a 
long life.
^
^ A number of philosophers have 
suggested that Bayes’s theorem 
is the basis for the correct 
understanding of how to deal 
with Goodman’s grue problem. 
In fact, many philosophers 
think that by applying the 
insights that Bayes introduced, 
we may solve a number of 
problems in both epistemology 
and the philosophy of science.

can in fact be a powerful tool for acquiring

philosophers who develop rules for good inferential 
practices are making important contributions to our

However, we’ve also seen reasons for thinking that, 
as with deduction, human beings are just not very 
reliable inductive reasoners. This suggests that if 
we’re trying to evaluate the structure of human

LECTURE 16
Know-How versus 
Propositional 
Knowledge
I
n addition to propositional knowledge, another type of 
knowledge is know-how. The objects of know-how are of 
a different type than those of propositional knowledge. 
Rather than taking as its object a proposition, or the sort 
of thing that could serve as the content of a claim, know-
how involves a skill or performance.

137
PERFORMATIVE VERSUS 
ACQUAINTANCE KNOW-HOW
^
^ Consider the following cases:
]
] Steve is a tennis coach who knows 
how to serve a tennis ball over 120 
miles per hour, though he is unable 
to do so that fast himself.
]
] Carl knows how to tell the sex of 
baby chicks, though he does not 
know how he knows.
^
^ Each of these is a case in which we 
naturally say that Steve or Carl 
possesses know-how. They each differ 
in a variety of ways, but there are 
also a number of similarities—two of 
which are particularly significant.
^
^ First, both cases involve a reliable 
disposition or ability on the part of 
Steve and Carl. Here, a disposition 
is simply a tendency to act, speak, or 
believe as long as certain conditions 
are met; this is important because a 
person may have certain dispositions 
that never become apparent.
^
^ This explains the case of Steve. 
Although he cannot serve the ball 
over 120 miles per hour himself, his 
knowledge of how to serve the ball 
that fast manifests itself, for example, 
in his disposition to tell his tennis 
students how to alter their serve 
mechanics so that they can improve 
their service speed.
^
^ Carl doesn’t have a mere disposition; 
he is actually able reliably to 
distinguish male from female chicks.
^
^ In both cases, we attribute the 
disposition or ability to the people 
performing the actions—to Steve 
or Carl.
^
^ Recall that when discussing self-
knowledge, we distinguished between 
computations or inferences that 
you perform and computations or 
inferences that your brain performs, 
without any awareness or intention 
on your part. That distinction applies 
again here. Neither of these cases 
involves mere actions of Steve’s or 
Carl’s bodily organs or muscles.
^
^ In addition to these similarities 
among the example cases, there 
are some important differences. In 
particular, while Carl’s knowledge 
of how to sort baby chicks involves a 
reliable ability to sort those chicks, 
Steve’s knowledge of how to serve a 
tennis ball more than 120 miles per 
hour does not involve a reliable ability 
to serve a ball that fast. While Steve 
can recognize the mechanics needed 
to achieve that velocity on serve and 
can tell his students how to achieve 
those mechanics, he isn’t able to 
replicate the mechanics himself.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 16  Know-How versus Propositional Knowledge

138
^
^ To distinguish Carl’s know-how from 
Steve’s, we can say that Carl has 
performative know-how.
^
^ There is a second major difference 
between Steve’s know-how and 
Carl’s. It seems plausible to explain 
know-how like Steve’s in terms of a 
reliable recognitional ability. When 
he perceives different mechanics of 
serving, he is reliably able to say which 
will result in a serve of at least 120 
miles per hour. When we discussed 
different kinds of knowledge, we 
characterized this type of ability to 
recognize something in perception 
as acquaintance knowledge. For this 
reason, we can say that Steve has 
acquaintance know-how.
^
^ In some cases, people can have both 
performative and acquaintance 
know-how. In fact, in some cases, it 
would probably be correct to explain 
someone’s performative know-how 
in terms of their acquaintance 
know-how. But it’s also possible for 
somebody to have performative know-
how without having acquaintance 
know-how. In fact, Carl is an example 
of that. Although some part of Carl’s 
brain performs calculations based 
on a certain way the chicks appear, 
Carl himself is not acquainted with 
any particular way of distinguishing 
between male and female chicks. He 
just knows that he’s good at it.
KNOWLEDGE-HOW VERSUS KNOWLEDGE-THAT
^
^ There is some parallel between the 
performative sense of knowledge-how 
and the externalist, reliabilist view of 
knowledge-that. Carl, for example, is 
reliable at distinguishing male from 
female baby chicks, without knowing 
how he’s able to be so reliable.
^
^ Analogously, there are some parallels 
between the acquaintance sense 
of know-how and internalist views 
of knowledge-that. Steve’s know-
how is closely tied to his having 
a representation of the kind of 
mechanics necessary to serve a 
tennis ball over 120 miles per hour. 
And Steve is able to verbalize his 
knowledge in a way that is helpful to 
the players he coaches.
^
^ Relatedly, internalism about 
knowledge-that supports the idea that 
the justifications of our knowledge 
are the sorts of things we’re often 
aware of. Because we’re aware 
of our justifications, we can not 
only verbalize them and transmit 
our knowledge to others but also 
explain to them the reasons for 
our knowledge.
^
^ British philosopher Gilbert Ryle 
was the first to argue explicitly for 
the claim that know-how is a form 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 16  Know-How versus Propositional Knowledge

139
of knowledge utterly distinct from 
factual or propositional knowledge—
knowledge-that. He suggests that 
there’s a threat of infinite regress if 
we think all knowledge is knowledge-
that, or propositional knowledge. 
Because that would be bad, Ryle 
thinks we’re forced to acknowledge 
that there’s another type of 
knowledge that is different in kind 
from knowledge-that. He thinks 
this different type of knowledge is 
knowledge-how.
I
n his book The Concept of Mind, Ryle argues that 
knowledge-how is a form of knowledge utterly 
distinct from knowledge-that:
To put it quite generally, the absurd assumption 
made by the intellectualist legend [i.e., the idea 
that all knowledge-how is a form of knowledge-
that] is this, that a performance of any sort 
inherits all its title to intelligence from some 
anterior internal operation of planning what to 
do. … By the original argument, therefore, our 
intellectual planning process must inherit its 
title to shrewdness from yet another interior 
process of planning to plan, and this process 
could in its turn be [analyzed with respect to its 
shrewdness]. The regress is infinite.
T
he expression 
“the ghost in the 
machine” is one of 
Ryle’s colorful ways of 
dismissing the idea of 
internal, unobservable 
mental states.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 16  Know-How versus Propositional Knowledge

140
^
^ In our discussion of Steve and Carl, 
we saw a number of independent 
reasons for thinking that at least 
one sense of knowledge-how, the 
performative sense, is not a form of 
knowledge-that. This would seem to 
provide some support for Ryle’s claim.
^
^ An influential challenge to Ryle was 
published in the Journal of Philosophy 
in 2001 by philosophers Jason Stanley 
and Timothy Williamson, who 
read Ryle as trying to show that the 
assumption “all knowledge-how is 
really just propositional knowledge” 
leads to a contradiction. Ryle does 
this by suggesting, first, that if you 
perform some action intentionally, 
then you’re employing knowledge-
how to perform that action. From 
there, he suggests that if you employ 
some of your knowledge-that, or 
propositional knowledge, it means 
that you must be contemplating the 
proposition that you know.
^
^ Here, according to Stanley and 
Williamson, is how Ryle thinks the 
problematic regress gets started. 
According to this reading of Ryle, 
everyone who performs some action 
intentionally is employing knowledge-
how. And if the “intellectualist 
legend” is true, this means that by 
employing knowledge-how, they’re 
actually employing knowledge-that.
^
^ Everyone who employs knowledge-
that, according to this reading of Ryle, 
must contemplate the proposition 
that they know. Contemplating a 
proposition, however, is itself an 
action. And now we’re trapped in the 
beginning of the regress.
^
^ Stanley and Williamson object to 
Ryle’s argument. To do so, they 
appeal to an earlier reply to Ryle 
given by philosopher Carl Ginet in 
his book Knowledge, Perception, and 
Memory. They argue that Ryle is 
making a mistake if he’s suggesting 
that whenever anyone employs 
propositional knowledge they’re 
also performing the distinct action 
of contemplating the proposition 
that they know. Why think that 
contemplating a proposition is itself a 
distinct and separate action?
^
^ That does indeed seem plausible. 
And the only way Ryle can dispute 
Ginet’s argument, Stanley and 
Williamson suggest, is by interpreting 
the contemplation of propositions as a 
nonintentional—or otherwise deflated 
sense—of action. But the whole point 
of Stanley and Williamson’s reading 
of Ryle’s argument requires that the 
actions we’re looking at be intentional 
actions. Without that, the regress 
won’t get off the ground.
^
^ In other words, according to Stanley 
and Williamson, Ryle needs two 
fundamental claims to make his 
infinite regress argument against the 
intellectualist legend: Ryle needs it to 
be the case that when you contemplate 
a proposition, you’re performing an 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 16  Know-How versus Propositional Knowledge

141
action, and he needs it to be the case 
that it should count as an intentional 
action. But those two things together, 
according to Stanley and Williamson, 
just aren’t plausible. So, it seems that 
Ryle’s argument just won’t work.
^
^ If Stanley and Williamson are reading 
Ryle correctly, then it seems that Ryle’s 
argument rests on a mistake. The 
regress that Ryle tries to use against 
what he calls the “intellectualist 
legend” can’t even get started.
UNDERSTANDING RYLE’S ARGUMENT
^
^ Stanley and Williamson take Ryle to 
be talking about intentional actions. 
But in the passage, Ryle never uses 
the words “intend,” “intention,” or 
“intentional.” Instead, he talks about 
“intelligent” actions.
^
^ Stanley and Williamson do Ryle a 
disservice by taking his argument 
to be dealing with all intentional 
actions, more broadly. Rather, Ryle 
is focusing on the narrower category 
that he refers to as “intelligent.”
^
^ In the context of his discussion, Ryle 
is using the term “intelligent” to 
characterize the actions that display 
knowledge-how. This also makes 
more sense. Stanley and Williamson’s 
version of Ryle’s argument relied 
on the claim that every intentional 
action involves knowledge-how. But 
that’s just not a plausible claim.
^
^ Here’s why it’s not plausible to think 
that every action that you intend 
involves know-how. When you’re 
learning how to perform some action 
skillfully, you intend to perform the 
action, but you don’t yet know how 
to do it. That’s the only way you can 
acquire know-how in the first place.
^
^ Here’s how we ought to understand 
Ryle’s argument.
^
^ First, we should characterize the 
“intellectualist legend” that Ryle is 
attempting to criticize. According 
to the “intellectualist legend,” 
all knowledge-how is a type of 
knowledge-that. The intellectualist 
presumes that whenever you perform 
an action on the basis of your 
knowledge-how, there is a certain way 
you have for performing that action—
let’s call that your method. With that 
assumption, we can characterize 
the “legend” as the thesis of 
intellectualism, like this:
b
bIntellectualism says that know-how 
involves guiding your performance 
on the basis of your knowledge of 
a proposition. The proposition you 
know is that your method is a way to 
perform the action.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 16  Know-How versus Propositional Knowledge

142
^
^ The argument then seems to run 
as follows:
1	 If your action is a knowledgeable 
one, then you perform that 
action on the basis of your 
knowledge-how.
2	 Intellectualism is true.
3	 So, then you must have a method 
on which your performance of 
the action is based, and you must 
guide your performance on the 
basis of your knowledge of the 
fact that your method is a way to 
perform the action.
4	 If you guide your performance 
on the basis of your propositional 
knowledge, then that guidance 
itself must be knowledgeable.
^
^ But now we have to apply the 
intellectualism thesis again, to the 
fourth premise, and so on. That looks 
like an infinite regress.
^
^ This version of Ryle’s argument 
does not rest on any independently 
implausible theses concerning what 
is involved in employing knowledge-
that, or propositional knowledge. In 
fact, it seems to employ only claims 
that a defender of the intellectualist 
legend would accept.
^
^ The intellectualist would not object to 
the first claim. All it does is capture the 
difference between action on the basis 
of knowledge-how—i.e., knowledgeable 
action—and action that accidentally 
achieves the desired result.
^
^ It also doesn’t seem that the 
intellectualist can reject the thesis 
of intellectualism, because the 
intellectualist will need that thesis to 
rule out the types of cases, like Carl, 
that motivated us to introduce the 
performative sense of knowledge-how 
in the beginning of the lecture.
^
^ This is because for the intellectualist 
view of knowledge-how to work, 
intellectualists would have to claim 
that the only sort of knowledge-how 
is captured by the acquaintance sense 
of knowledge-how. Then, they could 
say this: When you perform an action 
on the basis of know-how, it’s because 
you’re acquainted with a method for 
performing that action and you know 
that the method you’re acquainted 
with is a way to reliably perform the 
action. That’s just what it means to 
say that knowledge-how is a species 
of knowledge-that, or propositional 
knowledge. And in fact, that’s exactly 
Stanley and Williamson’s view.
^
^ That’s why it looks like the opponents 
of Ryle’s position would have to 
accept the intellectualism thesis—and 
the second step of the argument.
^
^ The next step of the argument we 
have to consider is the fourth claim. 
Why think that your guidance of 
your performance also has to be 
knowledgeable? The reason is that 
there has to be a connection between 
the acquaintance knowledge you have 
and your performance of the action. 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 16  Know-How versus Propositional Knowledge

143
Otherwise, you wouldn’t actually be 
performing the action on the basis of 
your knowledge-how.
^
^ We’ve covered all of the steps in the 
argument that the intellectualist 
could possibly try to criticize. It seems 
that Ryle’s infinite regress argument 
is a strong one after all. And this 
means that there is a type of know-
how, such as the procedural know-
how possessed by Carl, that isn’t a 
form of propositional knowledge.
A
s with our discussions of externalism, the 
discussion of the performative sense of know-
how suggests that it would be a mistake to place 
too much emphasis on the role of our internal 
mental states in knowledge.

Knowledge Derived 
from Testimony
M
ost of the discussions in this course so far have 
centered around individualistic sources of 
knowledge; in other words, the sources have 
involved skills or abilities that you could exercise 
in solitude. However, much of what you know was 
gained by means of consulting others’ expertise. 
In philosophy, the process of acquiring information 
through language-based communication with 
others is called testimony. Consider all of the ways 
in which testimony is woven into the fabric of our 
knowledge, from large-scale science and team-
based medical research to investigative reporting—
any of which would be unthinkable without relying 
on information derived from testimony.

146
NON-PRESUMPTIVISM
^
^ Suppose we grant that testimony is 
an extremely important source of 
knowledge. We’re then faced with the 
question of how the beliefs we form 
on the basis of testimony achieve the 
level of knowledge. Someone tells you 
something, or you read something, 
and you believe it. Is that enough 
to count as knowledge if what you 
believe turns out to be true? How 
does that work?
^
^ One explanation was given by 
David Hume:
b
b[A]s the evidence, derived from 
witnesses and human testimony, 
is founded on past experience, 
so it varies with the experience, 
and is regarded either as a proof 
or a probability, according as the 
conjunction between any particular 
kind of report and any kind of 
object has been found to be constant 
or variable.
^
^ In other words, it is not enough 
simply to be told something or to 
read something in order to have 
good evidence. Instead, if you believe 
something on the basis of someone’s 
testimony, you have to support your 
belief on the basis of an argument.
^
^ This may seem surprising, given 
that the last time we encountered 
Hume he was arguing that inductive 
reasoning never provides us with 
actual reasons for our beliefs. 
However, when it comes to testimony, 
Hume suggests that the evidence we 
derive from testimony is simply a 
form of inductive inference.
^
^ Suppose you receive testimony from 
Tim. Hume thinks that you ought to 
reason according to something like 
the following basic structure:
1	 Tim, who has certain attributes 
that are relevant to you taking 
him seriously in this kind of 
situation, gives you some piece of 
information.
2	 Generally, when speakers who are 
similar to Tim—and in similar 
types of situations—give you some 
piece of information, their reports 
are reliable.
3	 Thus, (probably) the information 
Tim has given you is likely true.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 17  Knowledge Derived from Testimony

147
S
ay you’re a detective and you’re trying to gather 
information about the location of a suspect at the 
time a crime occurred. You ask the suspect’s secretary, 
who doesn’t particularly like the suspect and who has 
no knowledge of when the crime occurred, and she 
gives you information about the suspect’s activities, 
from which you gather that the suspect was nowhere 
near the location of the crime at the time the crime 
occurred.
In this case, the relevant attributes of the testifier 
include her lack of motivation to lie to give an alibi to 
the suspect as well as her lack of knowledge about 
the time for which the suspect would need an alibi. In 
a situation like this one, you can reasonably assume 
that the secretary is telling the truth and conclude that 
the suspect probably has a strong alibi for the time in 
question.
When you consider examples like this, Hume’s view 
about testimony sounds pretty strong.
^
^ Because Hume requires that you 
have positive reasons, in the form 
of an argument, for accepting that 
testimony as evidence for knowledge, 
we can call his view inferentialist 
non-presumptivism. It’s inferentialist 
because you need to support your 
acceptance of testimony by means 
of an inductive inference. And it’s 
non-presumptivist because testimony 
doesn’t enjoy any presumption of 
truth; you have to have positive 
reasons for accepting someone’s 
testimony if you’re going to rely 
on that testimony as evidence for 
knowledge.
^
^ Even though Hume’s view is one of 
the most popular positions historically 
about the nature of evidence that 
testimony provides for knowledge, it’s 
not the only influential theory.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 17  Knowledge Derived from Testimony

148
^
^ Pretty soon after Hume proposed 
the theory, other philosophers noted 
problems with it. One of the strongest 
critics of Hume’s inferentialism was 
philosopher Thomas Reid, who raised 
a number of criticisms of Hume’s 
theory of testimony—of which we will 
focus on two.
]
] Reid criticizes Hume for getting the 
phenomenology of believing on the 
basis of testimony wrong. Normally, 
when someone tells you something 
and you don’t have a particular 
reason not to believe the person, 
then you just do believe them, 
without rehearsing any sort of 
argument in support of your belief.
]
] Reid asks us to consider how 
children learn from the people 
around them and suggests that 
children aren’t capable of using 
inductive inference to support 
their reliance on other people’s 
testimony. Not only do they lack 
the reasoning skills, but they also 
lack the experience needed to have 
a basis for an inductive argument. 
If Hume were correct, Reid says, 
you would expect children to be 
the most mistrustful of testimony, 
while the most knowledgeable, 
most experienced people would be 
the most trusting of testimony. As 
Reid notes, however, this is not the 
case. Children are quite willing to 
accept the testimony of the people 
around them.
^
^ Reid defends a rival theory about the 
way that testimony provides support 
for knowledge. Unfortunately, it is 
not entirely clear what theory Reid 
advances to replace Hume’s. We’ll 
consider two options.
^
^ Both rival theories to Hume share 
one big similarity: They assert that, 
at least sometimes, you can know 
something on the basis of someone’s 
testimony even if you aren’t aware 
of any positive reasons in support of 
your belief of that person’s testimony. 
In other words, they reject Hume’s 
requirement that you can’t know 
something on the basis of testimony 
unless you rehearse positive reasons 
for accepting that testimony.
^
^ Where the two challengers to Hume 
differ, however, is in their explanation 
for why they reject Hume’s positive 
reasons requirement.
EXTERNALISM
^
^ One motivation for rejecting Hume’s 
positive reasons requirement comes 
from externalism. An externalist 
theory of knowledge on the basis 
of testimony would allow that if 
you are in circumstances in which 
the testimony you’re receiving is a 
reliable source of information, you can 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 17  Knowledge Derived from Testimony

149
acquire knowledge on the basis of that 
testimony as long as the reason you 
believe it is that your acceptance of the 
testimony involves a reliable method.
^
^ Most externalist theories of 
testimonial knowledge think that 
the phrase “your acceptance of the 
testimony involves a reliable method” 
involves at least two components.
]
] You can’t have any positive reason 
to question the circumstances or 
the speakers. If you’re in a used car 
showroom and you know that the 
salesperson earns most of his or her 
money from commissions, then you 
shouldn’t automatically trust the 
salesperson when he or she says the 
car you’re interested in has never 
been in any major accidents.

] You also have some set of 
unconscious abilities that monitor 
the trustworthiness or honesty of 
your sources of information. In 
face-to-face communication, this 
would include signals the speaker 
gives off that you might not even be 
consciously aware of but that are 
supposed to alert you if your brain 
is triggered by anything suspicious. 
Let’s call this the unconscious 
monitoring requirement.
O
ur culture is full of evidence that many of 
us at least intuitively accept the idea of an 
unconscious monitoring requirement. For example, 
you might read an interview with a policeman who 
caught a serial killer during a routine traffic stop 
and perhaps the policeman says, “Something just 
seemed off about the guy when I stopped him.”
I
n our discussions of 
perception and memory, 
we’ve seen that externalists 
allow for the possibility 
that we might not know 
when our perceptual 
abilities are reliable but 
that we can still know 
information we acquire 
using those abilities.
For the sort of externalist 
theories we’ve been 
considering, it is enough 
that the methods we use to 
acquire information are in 
fact reliable. Those theories 
don’t require that we also 
have good evidence that 
they are reliable.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 17  Knowledge Derived from Testimony

^
^ An advantage of the externalist 
take on testimony is that it can treat 
testimony as completely on par with 
perception or memory. As with those 
sources of knowledge, we are not 
always aware when we are reliable or 
what the mechanism is that ensures 
we are reliable. What is important in 
all cases, for the externalist, is the fact 
that we are reliable.
^
^ Hume’s non-presumptivist 
inferentialist theory differs from 
externalism, then, in one very 
important respect: It requires you to 
have a positive argument in support 
of your acceptance of someone’s 
testimony. In contrast, the externalist 
theory only requires that someone’s 
testimony actually is a reliable source 
of information if you are going to rely 
on that testimony.
^
^ However, like Hume, the externalist 
also thinks you have to be sensitive to 
relevant features of the testimony that 
serve as indicators of its reliability. 
It’s just that the externalist thinks 
that you can be sensitive to these 
features unconsciously and that you 
don’t have to use them to formulate 
an explicit argument in support of 
your acceptance of a given piece 
of testimony.
PRESUMPTIVISM
^
^ Another rival view agrees with 
the externalist in rejecting Hume’s 
positive reasons requirement but 
goes even further by also rejecting 
the externalist requirement of 
unconscious monitoring of testimony 
for indicators of reliability. Let’s call 
this view presumptivism, because 
the various versions of the view all 
involve a presumptive right to accept 
someone’s testimony.
^
^ These views hold that whenever you 
receive a piece of testimony, you 
have the right to assume, without 
rehearsing positive evidence, that 
what the testimony says is true, 
unless you have specific evidence that 
overrides that presumption.
^
^ Presumptivism doesn’t seem to have 
anything to do with knowledge. In 
order for a source of information 
to be a source of knowledge, it 
should reliably provide you with 
accurate information. Hume’s 
theory of testimony accounts for 
this by requiring you to give an 
explicit argument that the testimony 
you’re receiving is reliably tied 
to the truth. And externalism 
accounts for this by requiring that 
the testimony in fact be reliably 
accurate. But presumptivism doesn’t 
seem to do anything to account 
for the fact that we need sources of 
knowledge to be reliable sources of 
accurate information.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 17  Knowledge Derived from Testimony

151
^
^ The standard strategy for defending 
presumptivism is to argue that 
anything more than presumptivism 
would actually be requiring too much 
and would make knowledge from 
testimony too hard to come by.
^
^ One version of this defense of 
presumptivism argues simply that 
presumptivism is the only explanation 
available for how we gain knowledge 
through testimony. Another version 
argues in particular that without 
accepting presumptivism, we would 
have no explanation for how we 
communicate with others using 
language. Because language is 
required to gain knowledge from 
testimony, however, this version 
is also ultimately arguing that the 
only explanation for how we gain 
knowledge from testimony requires 
that we accept presumptivism.
^
^ While there doesn’t seem to be a 
good reason to accept presumptivism, 
there are good reasons to reject it. 
In particular, it doesn’t do enough to 
ensure that the testimony we rely on 
will actually be accurate enough to 
support knowledge.
^
^ Although Hume’s inferentialism does 
better than presumptivism in this 
regard, there are some good reasons 
not to accept it. In particular, it doesn’t 
do a good job of accounting for how 
we seem to deal with other people’s 
testimony or of explaining how little 
children learn from testimony.
^
^ That leaves us with externalism. Like 
presumptivism, it doesn’t require that 
we give an argument in support of 
our acceptance of testimony, but like 
Hume’s non-presumptivism, it does 
require that we have some way to 
ensure that the testimony we rely on 
will be reliably accurate.

LECTURE 18
Social Psychology and 
Source Monitoring
I
n the previous lecture, we discovered that neither 
presumptivism nor Hume’s non-presumptivism was very 
promising as a theory of how we acquire knowledge through 
our belief in testimony. It looked like externalism’s notion of 
unconscious monitoring offered the best of both worlds: It 
allowed us to avoid having to follow Hume and require an 
explicit argument in support of testimony, something that 
didn’t seem very plausible, and it also allowed us to avoid 
having to follow the presumptivist and advocate what looked 
like excessive gullibility, something that didn’t seem very 
plausible either. However, the unconscious monitoring relied 
on by the externalist theory won’t work either. There is a 
great deal of evidence that we try to look out for signs that 
the testimony we rely on is accurate—in fact, few results in 
social psychology are better supported—but we’re just not 
very good at monitoring for signs that the testimony we rely 
on is accurate.

154
MONITORING FOR SINCERITY AND DECEPTIVENESS
^
^ More than 50 years of research has 
established that humans are quite 
unreliable at responding to indicators 
of trustworthiness or deceit. In fact, 
most people would do just as well 
to guess or flip a coin to determine 
whether someone is lying or being 
truthful.
^
^ One reason why we’re so unreliable 
at detecting truthfulness has to do 
with the signs that we look for when 
we’re judging whether someone is 
sincere. Some of those signs include 
maintaining good eye contact, not 
smiling or laughing too much, and 
projecting confidence—all of which 
we rely on. The problem is that none 
of those signs are actually reliable 
indicators of sincerity.
]
] Repeated research since the early 
1980s has demonstrated that people 
who are attempting to deceive you 
actually sustain eye contact better 
than people who are being sincere.
]
] Research has also shown that when 
it comes to keeping a straight face, 
people who are being deceptive 
don’t have more nervous smiles 
than truth tellers. If anything, liars 
smile somewhat less often.
]
] In one of the most surprising 
studies of confidence, patients were 
asked to interact with doctors—
actually, actors playing doctors. 
One actor was told to act blithely 
confident, despite admitting that 
the area wasn’t an area of his 
expertise. The other actor was told 
to admit that the area wasn’t one 
in which he was an expert and, 
in front of the patient, consult a 
reputed textbook on the subject. 
Patients preferred the blithely 
confident “doctor” to the one who 
admitted his lack of expertise but 
who cited the appropriate source in 
the presence of the patient.
^
^ So much for trustworthiness. Perhaps, 
however, our unconscious monitoring 
is directed more at warning us when 
someone is being deceptive rather 
than at reassuring us when someone 
is being sincere. Is that a promising 
route to defending our unconscious 
monitoring abilities?
^
^ Unfortunately, decades of empirical 
research provide no empirical support 
for the notion that subjects are 
reliable at detecting deception. Here 
is how two of the most prominent 
researchers in the field, Paul Ekman 
and Maureen O’Sullivan, put it:
b
bIn every study reported, people have 
not been very accurate in judging 
when someone is lying. … Average 
accuracy in detecting deceit has 
rarely been above 60% (with chance 
being 50%), and some groups have 
done worse than chance.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 18  Social Psychology and Source Monitoring

155
^
^ Even people whose careers—if not 
their lives—depend on their ability 
to detect deceptiveness are not 
overall particularly reliable at it. 
Research conducted on customs 
officials, federal law enforcement 
officers, and police officers suggested 
that their overall reliability was so 
disappointing that, as one team 
of researchers concluded, “it is 
unlikely that judging deception from 
demeanor will ever be sufficiently 
accurate to be admissible in the 
courtroom” and “most of us would 
do well to entertain some skepticism 
about our ability to detect deception 
from demeanor.”
^
^ Maybe the problem is that the research 
so far has had to do with people 
trying to detect deceptive behavior in 
strangers. Maybe at least we get better 
at detecting deception in people we 
know. Here’s the problem with that 
line of thought: Just as you get more 
familiar with someone and know more 
about the person’s demeanor and 
so on, he or she is also getting more 
familiar with you and more able to 
tailor his or her way of communicating 
to your particular personality.
^
^ Two of the most prominent 
researchers on deception detection, 
David Buller and Judee Burgoon, have 
suggested that “deceivers in interactive 
contexts should display increasing 
immediacy and involvement, 
pleasantness, composure, fluency, and 
smooth turn taking over the course of 
the interaction.”
^
^ And in fact, this is what studies seem 
to suggest. For example, a study 
conducted by Steven McCornack and 
Malcolm Parks in the 1980s examined 
partners in intimate relationships. 
Though the partners actually had 
greater confidence in their ability to 
detect deception, they were in fact 
worse at detecting deception in their 
partners than in others.
MONITORING FOR COMPETENCE
^
^ Although we can’t monitor for 
sincerity or deceptiveness, what 
about monitoring for competence? 
Surely we’re better at recognizing 
when the people we’re speaking with 
actually know what they’re talking 
about, right?
^
^ Unfortunately, the news about 
monitoring for competence isn’t 
very good either. Consider a study 
conducted in the 1970s by Donald 
Naftulin and his colleagues, who 
gave the name Dr. Myron L. Fox 
to a television actor to pose as an 
authority on the application of 
mathematics to human behavior. The 
actor was then coached to present 
an hour-long talk on “Mathematical 
Game Theory as Applied to Physician 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 18  Social Psychology and Source Monitoring

156
Education,” full of nonsense, 
made-up terms, bad reasoning, 
and contradictions. Naftulin and 
his associates then examined the 
responses to that talk from three 
separate groups.
]
] The first group was composed of 
psychiatrists, psychologists, and 
social-worker educators attending a 
conference for educators of health 
professionals. They attended the 
talk and then had a half-hour 
discussion period during which 
they had an opportunity to question 
“Dr. Fox” further.
]
] The second group consisted 
of mental health educators—
psychiatrists, psychologists, and 
psychiatric social workers. The 
second group, however, merely 
viewed the lecture and the 
discussion period on videotape.
]
] The third group was made up 
of educators and administrators 
taking a graduate-level education 
course. That group also viewed the 
lecture and discussion on videotape.
^
^ In all of the groups, a vast majority 
of participants responded positively 
to the following questions about 
“Dr. Fox” and his lecture:
]
] Did he use enough examples to 
clarify his material?
]
] Did he present his material in a 
well-organized form?
]
] Did he stimulate your thinking?
]
] Did he put his material across in an 
interesting way?
^
^ Some of the terms used in their 
feedback included “articulate,” 
“knowledgeable,” “good analysis 
of subject that has been personally 
studied before,” “lively examples,” 
“excellent presentation,” “enjoyed 
listening,” and “too intellectual a 
presentation.”
^
^ Naftulin and his colleagues 
reference Neil Postman and Charles 
Weingartner’s claim in their book 
Teaching as a Subversive Activity that
b
bit is the sign of a competent crap 
detector that he is not completely 
captivated by the arbitrary 
abstractions of the community in 
which he happened to grow up [when 
they conclude that] the three groups of 
learners in this study, all of whom had 
grown up in the academic community 
and were experienced educators, 
obviously failed as “competent crap 
detectors” and were seduced by 
the style of Dr. Fox’s presentation. 
Considering the educational 
sophistication of the subjects, it is 
striking that none of them detected the 
lecture for what it was.
^
^ The problem is that it is taxing to 
think too carefully about whether 
someone is competent. It is easier 
to rely on superficial signs of 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 18  Social Psychology and Source Monitoring

157
competence—such as whether 
Myron L. Fox is called “doctor,” 
is dressed professionally, or seems 
competent. Noted social psychologist 
Robert Cialdini calls this the “click, 
whirr mode” of reacting.
^
^ Examples of the “click, whirr mode” 
abound. For example, in a 1996 
study, Joel Cooper and his colleagues 
had a mock trial jury listen to one 
of two expert witnesses. The first 
expert witness, who was introduced 
as having outstanding credentials, 
gave a jargon-filled, incomprehensible 
testimony. The other expert witness 
gave exactly the same testimony 
but was introduced as having shaky 
credentials. The mock trial jury 
was much more likely to believe the 
testimony given by the expert witness 
introduced as having the outstanding 
credentials—even though the 
testimony itself was exactly the same 
jargon-filled nonsense.
^
^ Surprisingly, when the witness was 
introduced as having outstanding 
credentials, the jury found him almost 
twice as persuasive when he presented 
his argument incomprehensibly than 
when he presented the same testimony 
using terms that the layperson could 
follow. In other words, the jury found 
the expert much more convincing 
when they had no idea what he was 
talking about!
^
^ The way Cooper and his colleagues 
made sense of this was that the 
members of the mock trial jury 
actually preferred using the easier 
“click, whirr mode” of just deferring 
to the supposed expert’s competence 
than evaluating his arguments on 
their merits.
N
one of this should make us very optimistic that 
we’re generally all that reliable at unconsciously 
monitoring competence, either. So, in other words, we’re 
three for three: bad at monitoring for sincerity, bad at 
monitoring for deceptiveness, and bad at monitoring for 
competence.

LECTURE 19
Testimony through 
Social Networks
T
he previous two lectures have examined the three most 
prominent theories of how we can support our knowledge 
on the basis of the evidence we get from the testimony 
of other people: presumptivism, non-presumptivism, and 
externalism. But none of these theories seems adequate. 
There is an alternative picture that offers a new solution. 
Like externalism and presumptivism, this new solution 
rejects Hume’s requirement that we support our belief 
in testimony on the basis of an explicit argument. Like 
externalism and Hume’s non-presumptivism, this solution 
also suggests there is an important insight in requiring 
that there be a mechanism to ensure that the testimony 
we’re relying on is reliably accurate. Unlike externalism, 
however, this new solution doesn’t require that we base 
that assurance on any of the unreliable mechanisms social 
psychologists suggest we employ when we try to monitor 
testimony for signs of accuracy.

160
DUNBAR’S NUMBER
^
^ One of the most famous numbers in 
social science is Dunbar’s number, 
named after anthropologist and 
evolutionary psychologist Robin 
Dunbar, who first proposed it in the 
1990s. As a researcher working with 
nonhuman primates, he was curious 
about why the primates he was 
studying spent so much of their time 
and effort grooming each other.
^
^ In the 1980s, the view that came to be 
known as the social brain hypothesis 
was starting to gain attention in 
primate studies. According to 
this hypothesis, we can explain 
the comparatively large size of 
primate brains because of the social 
complexity of the groups they live in.
^
^ Dunbar’s idea was to link the size 
of a primate’s social group—which 
he defined in terms of its grooming 
behavior—and the size of the part of 
the primate brain that is responsible 
for tracking complex information, the 
neocortex.
^
^ From his grooming data, Dunbar 
figured out the average social group 
sizes for the primate species he was 
studying. From there, he hypothesized 
that the number of group members 
an average primate of that species 
would have in its social group could 
be predicted based on the ratio of the 
volume of the neocortex to the total 
brain volume of that species.
^
^ But what sparked widespread 
interest in Dunbar’s work was that he 
extrapolated his results to humans. 
Building on the ratio that he had 
established and based on the size of 
an average human brain, Dunbar 
predicted that the number of people 
that the average human has in his 
or her casual social group is around 
150—the most famous of a series of 
Dunbar’s numbers.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 19  Testimony through Social Networks

161
^
^ Dunbar suggested that we each have 
different-sized social groups relating 
to each other by a precise formula 
that we can approximate with a rule 
of three. As we consider the people 
we have more distant connections 
with, we each have about 500 
acquaintances and up to about 1,500 
people that we can recognize by face.
^
^ At the other extreme, we’re most 
closely connected to about 5 people—
our closest friends or family—then 
15 people—the ones that we would 
confide in or turn to in a time of 
need—and then about 50 people who 
are our friends but not ones we would 
think to call in an emergency.
^
^ The midpoint of those more intimate 
and more distant social relations is 
the Dunbar number that most people 
know: 150. Dunbar found that you 
didn’t have the same 5, or 15, or 50 
people in those different social groups 
but that the people who make up 
the groups can change over time. 
However, the number of people in 
the different groups stays roughly 
the same.
Y
ears of research have confirmed the validity of 
Dunbar’s numbers.
For example, armies throughout history have been 
organized roughly along the lines predicted by 
Dunbar’s research. The smallest units tend to be 
between 10 and 15 people, with larger organizational 
units ranging up to companies of around 150 
soldiers and up to battalions or regiments of 
between 500 and 1,000 personnel.
^
^ Two of the scholars who have done 
the most to popularize the study 
of how the structure of our social 
networks influence different aspects 
of our lives are Nicholas Christakis 
and James Fowler. In their book 
Connected, they trace a number of 
effects that social networks can have 
on us, from our health to our political 
affiliations to our success in finding 
work. One of those effects is how we 
can gain information through our 
social connections.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 19  Testimony through Social Networks

162
WEAK TIES
^
^ Sociology professor Mark 
Granovetter has emphasized the 
importance of so-called weak ties, 
which are our connections to the 
friends of our friends, or even to our 
friends’ friends’ friends.
^
^ A simplistic picture of influence 
would be to think of the spread of 
information between people like a 
bucket brigade. You pass information 
to your friend, who passes 
information to his or her friend, and 
so on. The problem with this is that 
if we only pass information to those 
we’re closely connected with—our 
strong ties—the information would 
never travel very far.
^
^ And this is where the power of weak 
ties comes in. In an example from 
Christakis and Fowler’s Connected, 
almost 40 percent of a piano 
teacher’s recommendations weren’t 
from direct acquaintances but from 
acquaintances three degrees removed.
NETWORK EFFECTS
^
^ Not all social networks select the 
best ideas. Instead, the makeup of a 
social network and which components 
of that network have influence can 
affect which ideas come out on top in 
that network.
^
^ This might seem surprising. Many 
people seem to have two intuitions 
that work against the idea that 
different social networks can propel 
different ideas to the top: that quality 
always wins out in the end and that 
people will choose the best option 
regardless of other people’s opinions. 
It turns out, however, that both of 
these intuitions are wrong.
^
^ Results of a study done by sociologist 
Duncan Watts and his collaborators, 
Matthew Salganik and Peter Dodds, 
in the mid-2000s suggest that, at the 
very least, structures of social networks 
make a difference as to the quality of 
the information that you draw from 
those networks. In particular, they 
demonstrate that popularity on a 
network matters: Small differences in 
the popularity of an idea can make 
a big difference with respect to the 
spread of that idea, and that difference 
can’t be explained through appeal to 
the intrinsic quality of the idea itself.
^
^ This suggests that the structure of a 
social network is not irrelevant when 
analyzing the ideas that become 
popular on that social network. 
Furthermore, we can also use different 
measures for distinguishing between 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 19  Testimony through Social Networks

163
good and bad ideas. Given our interest 
in knowledge, one obvious measure 
that we could use to distinguish 
between ideas would be in terms of 
how true or accurate they are.
^
^ Taken altogether, this means that 
popularity on a social network is not 
a guarantee of how true or accurate 
that idea is. Different social network 
structures, in particular, can differ 
with respect to how well they do in 
making the true ideas popular and 
ensuring that the popular ideas in 
the social network are also true and 
accurate. In other words, if you’re 
lucky enough to be in a social network 
in which the successful ideas are also 
true, then you’ll end up endorsing 
many true ideas, but if you’re unlucky 
and find yourself in a social network 
in which the successful ideas aren’t all 
that reliably accurate, then you’ll end 
up with a lot of misinformation.
^
^ From the components of Dunbar’s 
number, weak ties, and network 
effects, two big conclusions can be 
drawn about how we actually gain 
information from testimony.
]
] The social groups in which we’re 
embedded are often too large and 
complex for us to keep track of 
the individual reliability of each 
of the members of those social 
groups. The “too large” part of 
this claim is derived from the 
discussion of Dunbar’s number. 
Even if you focus on the most 
widely cited number—150—that’s 
too large for you to keep track, 
in a very systematic or reliable 
way, of how accurate each of 
those 150 people is with respect 
to all of the information he or she 
passes along. The “too complex” 
part of the claim comes from 
the importance of weak ties. It’s 
hard enough to keep track of 
your casual acquaintances. But 
it’s not possible for you to keep 
track of the casual acquaintances 
of your casual acquaintances’ 
casual acquaintances—though it’s 
these acquaintances that explain 
your weak ties. And given the 
importance of weak ties, these are 
the acquaintances that make a 
difference with respect to the sort 
of information that your social 
network gives you.
]
] The structure of our social networks 
can contribute to our acquiring 
reliably accurate information just 
because of our embeddedness in 
those networks. The first reason 
is due, again, to Christakis and 
Fowler’s discussion of weak social 
ties. According to them, a large 
amount of your information will 
be from people with whom you 
have no direct connection, not even 
casually. If you’re lucky enough, 
however, to have a network such 
that even those with whom you’re 
only connected through weak ties 
are reliably accurate informants, 
then you’ll gain a lot of reliably 
accurate information, just by 
being embedded in your social 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 19  Testimony through Social Networks

164
network. The second reason is due 
to the power of social networks to 
influence the ideas that we accept—
which we do so in large measure 
because they are popular rather 
than because they are “good” 
or true.
^
^ Suppose there was a social network 
in which the popular ideas were true, 
and vice versa. If you were lucky 
enough to be embedded in such a 
network, you would end up believing 
a lot of reliably accurate information. 
It might be the case that you’re 
believing the information because 
it’s popular in your network, and 
not because it’s true, or because you 
know it’s true. But for our purposes 
right now, that’s fine. The point 
would still remain: The structure of 
your social network would contribute 
to your reliably acquiring accurate 
information.
O
ur new theory is a form of externalism. It doesn’t 
require that we consciously screen out unreliable 
sources from reliable ones, but it’s a social externalism 
in that the screening process is completely off-loaded 
from the individual to the social network or networks 
in which he or she is embedded.
If the components of Dunbar’s number, weak ties, 
and network effects are taken together, they suggest 
that a social network can serve to ensure that the 
information you receive from your network is reliably 
accurate. That’s the foundation of social externalism.

LECTURE 20
The Reliability of 
Scientific Testimony
W
e shouldn’t give up on the idea that relying on 
testimony can only produce knowledge if there is 
a way to ensure the testimony we’re relying on is 
accurate. Instead, we should give up on the idea 
that the process ensuring that the testimony is 
accurate has to be located in the person relying on 
the testimony. And we should adopt a view called 
social externalism, introduced in the previous 
lecture. Socially distributed cognitive processes 
support the idea that social externalism is a 
genuine alternative both to traditional externalism 
and to Hume’s non-presumptive theory of 
testimony.

167
SOCIAL EXTERNALISM
^
^ Externalist theories of knowledge 
suggest that what makes a true belief 
count as an instance of knowledge 
is that the belief was formed by a 
reliably accurate cognitive process. 
So, what makes the position of 
social externalism different must 
have something to do with how it 
incorporates a social element into 
the theory of externalism. Thus, 
we can formulate a theory of social 
externalism by adding a notion 
of socially distributed cognitive 
processes to the theory of externalism 
that we already have.
^
^ Simply put, a socially distributed 
cognitive process is a cognitive 
process carried out not within the 
mind or brain of an individual 
person, but extended across a 
social network.
^
^ In a previous lecture, we were 
hesitant to endorse the view that the 
mind extends beyond the individual 
person. But now we’re suggesting 
that we should appeal to socially 
distributed cognitive processes. How 
are these two positions compatible?
^
^ The difference between the extended 
mind hypothesis and the current 
proposal is that extending the mind 
beyond the boundaries of the person 
does violence to the concept of mind, 
while adopting socially distributed 
cognitive processes does not do 
violence to the concept of cognition 
or the cognitive.

SOCIALLY DISTRIBUTED COGNITIVE PROCESSES
^
^ While idea of socially distributed 
cognitive processes or systems has only 
really become a topic of research in 
the last few decades, the idea of such 
systems is more than 100 years old.
^
^ Mathematician Charles Babbage was 
the first thinker to analyze socially 
distributed cognitive systems. In a 
chapter entitled “On the Division 
of Mental Labour” in his 1832 work 
On the Economy of Machinery and 
Manufactures, Babbage describes 
such a system in detail. In fact, it 
was Babbage’s discussion of socially 
distributed cognitive systems that 
gave him the idea for development of 
tools for mechanical computation.
^
^ In that chapter, Babbage describes 
a project organized by the French 
mathematician Gaspard de Prony to 
use a system of human “calculators” 
to compile a table of logarithms. The 
project was a huge success—extending 
over a number of years, with more 
than 100 workers assigned to different 
tasks—and eventually produced 18 
volumes.
^
^ The inaccuracy of mathematical 
tables was a significant impediment 
to scientific and technological 
progress—and a source of a great 
deal of financial insecurity—in the 
first half of the 19th century. This 
was the problem that de Prony solved 
by implementing a complex system 
of social organization designed 
specifically to achieve the most 
accurate tables of mathematical 
results known up to his time.
M
athematician Charles 
Babbage wrote that the use of 
inaccurate mathematical tables lost 
the British government “between 
two and three million” pounds 
sterling. Had the government 
invested just a fraction of that 
money on scientific research, 
Babbage suggested, such errors 
could easily have been avoided.

Lecture 20  The Reliability of Scientific Testimony

169
^
^ Here is Babbage’s description of de Prony’s design:
b
bFirst Section.—The duty of this first 
section was to investigate, amongst the 
various analytical expressions which 
could be found for the same function, 
that which was most readily adapted 
to simple numerical calculation by 
many individuals employed at the 
same time. This section had little 
or nothing to do with the actual 
numerical work. When its labours 
were concluded, the formulae on the 
use of which it had decided, were 
delivered to the second section. 
Second Section.—This section 
consisted of seven or eight persons 
of considerable acquaintance with 
mathematics: and their duty was to 
convert into numbers the formulae 
put into their hands by the first 
section,—an operation of great 
labour; and then to deliver out these 
formulae to the members of the third 
section, and receive from them the 
finished calculations. The members 
of this second section had certain 
means of verifying these calculations 
without the necessity of repeating, or 
even of examining the whole of the 
work done by the third section.
Third Section.—The members of 
this section, whose number varied 
from sixty to eighty, received certain 
numbers from the second section, 
and, using nothing more than simple 
addition and subtraction, they 
returned to that section the finished 
tables. It is remarkable that nine-
tenths of this class had no knowledge 
of arithmetic beyond its two first 
rules which they were thus called 
upon to exercise, and that these 
persons were usually found more 
correct in their calculations, than 
those who possessed a more extensive 
knowledge of the subject.
C
harles Babbage 
was one of the 
earliest researchers 
to explore the design 
of computers.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 20  The Reliability of Scientific Testimony

170
^
^ Babbage saw de Prony’s design as a 
model for future large-scale scientific 
investigations and called the tables 
that de Prony’s workers achieved “one 
of the most stupendous monuments 
of arithmetical calculation which the 
world has yet produced.”
^
^ Babbage recognized that one aspect 
of de Prony’s achievement rendered 
it almost unbelievable. As Babbage 
put it, the possibility of having 
achieved such a task employing only 
workers equipped with the most 
rudimentary arithmetical skills 
“may appear to non-mathematical 
readers to be rather too large 
a postulate,” one shrouded in 
“apparent mystery.”
A POTENTIAL OBJECTION TO SOCIAL EXTERNALISM
^
^ In the previous lecture, we argued 
for social externalism because we 
suggested that socially distributed 
cognitive processes are potentially 
much better than lone individuals at 
filtering out unreliable information 
sources. Why, then, couldn’t we 
require that individual people at least 
choose which socially distributed 
cognitive processes they are going 
to rely on based on how reliably 
accurate those socially distributed 
cognitive processes are?
^
^ In effect, if we make this argument, 
we’re suggesting that we should revive 
the Humean inferentialist theory, 
but now—instead of applying it to 
assessing individual informants—
we should apply it to the socially 
distributed cognitive processes we 
rely on.
^
^ Here are two reasons why this new 
application of Hume’s inferentialist 
theory won’t work.
]
] We humans are not very good 
at source monitoring, which 
means we’re not very good at 
remembering what the sources 
of our beliefs are. Applied to the 
socially distributed cognitive 
processes, this means we won’t 
remember which of our beliefs 
we owe to particular cognitive 
processes, so we won’t be able to 
correctly assess whether a cognitive 
process is reliably accurate.
]
] Even the participants in socially 
distributed cognitive processes 
often don’t know if they’re 
successful, or why. The reason for 
this is that the aspects of socially 
distributed cognitive processes 
that contribute to their success are 
not always obvious—even to the 
participants in those processes. And 
if the people intimately involved in 
those processes themselves often 
don’t know why those processes 
work, why would we expect 
outsiders to know?
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 20  The Reliability of Scientific Testimony

171
I
n 1986, cognitive science researcher Naomi Miyake demonstrated 
that even a team composed only of two people, both of whom feel 
they are participating in a joint activity they each fully understand, 
can have very different interpretations of a relatively simple activity. 
Imagine how much greater the interpretations can diverge as the 
socially distributed processes become larger and more complex.
CONTEMPORARY SCIENCE
^
^ Contemporary science provides us 
with examples of socially distributed 
cognitive processes. In fact, it would 
be a surprise if scientific researchers 
didn’t take advantage of such cognitive 
processes. The challenges facing 
contemporary scientists and the 
advantages offered by large-scale 
collaborations to amplify the capacities 
and expertise of their individual 
members make implementing socially 
distributed cognitive systems in 
scientific research a natural fit.
^
^ In fact, this is what Babbage 
predicted close to 200 years 
ago. He argued that the proof of 
concept in the industrialization of 
manufacturing would soon spread to 
science, writing that “[t]he progress 
of knowledge convinced the world 
that the system of the division of 
labour and of cooperation was as 
applicable to science, as it had been 
found available for the improvement 
of manufactures.”
^
^ For further evidence of the role 
of socially distributed cognitive 
processes in scientific research, we 
can also look to the work of John 
Seely Brown and Paul Duguid. In 
their highly influential 2000 book The 
Social Life of Information, they suggest 
that the complexity of knowledge 
creation, sharing, and deployment 
tasks involved in contemporary 
life favors the creation of socially 
distributed cognitive systems over the 
deployment of lone thinkers.
W
e think of big science—
like big data—as a 21st 
century phenomenon. But 
Alvin Weinberg, a prominent 
director of Oak Ridge National 
Laboratory, used the term “big 
science” in an article published 
in Science magazine in 1961.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 20  The Reliability of Scientific Testimony

172
^
^ So, if we consider the history of 
science as it progresses from Babbage’s 
day to ours, individual scientists 
have gradually been squeezed out 
of the picture in favor of the socially 
distributed cognitive systems that 
now account for so much of scientific 
activity. In fact, there are entire 
cities—such as the United States’ Oak 
Ridge National Laboratory, Japan’s 
Tsukuba Academic City, and the 
Soviet Union’s Akademgorodok—that 
arose in the 20th century to support 
scientific research. The analogy 
for the 21st century might be the 
“campuses” of Microsoft, Facebook, 
or Google, which are basically cities 
unto themselves.
^
^ The evolution of socially distributed 
cognitive systems leads to increasingly 
more finely drawn divisions of labor 
within the task, thus decreasing the 
cognitive demands on each of the 
individuals within those systems and 
taking advantage of the features of 
the cognitive system itself to create 
expertise.
^
^ In contemporary large-scale science, 
tasks have been portioned out among 
group members so as to reduce 
the complexity and computational 
demands required for the completion 
of those tasks. The widespread use of 
computers and other technological 
aids adds another dimension to the 
extent to which the results of scientific 
research can no longer be traced back 
to one solitary researcher—or even a 
small group of researchers.
^
^ Some of the clearest examples of 
science as a socially distributed 
cognitive process are the massive 
collaborative efforts involved in 
some of the biggest achievements 
of contemporary science, such 
as the sequencing of the human 
genome or the confirmation of the 
existence of the Higgs boson. These 
efforts result in articles listing many 
collaborators—sometimes even 
hundreds or more.
^
^ Contemporary scientific research 
meets our definition of a socially 
distributed cognitive process. The 
example of science provides strong 
support for the social externalist 
explanation for how testimony 
provides evidence for knowledge.

f social externalism is the correct theory of testimonial 
knowledge, then we have knowledge on the basis of 
the information we receive from socially distributed 
processes only if relying on those processes provides us 
with reliably accurate information. Do we, as theorists 
attempting to test whether social externalism offers a 
good theory of testimonial knowledge, have good reason 
to think there are any socially distributed processes that 
provide us with reliably accurate information?

175
FACT-CHECKING ORGANIZATIONS
^
^ There are a small number of news 
organizations that devote significant 
resources to establishing a culture of 
fact-checking. That includes having 
a group of employees whose job is 
dedicated to fact-checking and who 
are independent from the editors 
and writers, who often have a vested 
interest in seeing a story go to press.
^
^ Not only are there very few news 
organizations nowadays that have 
a strong culture of in-house fact-
checking, but if you look at the history 
of news organizations, the practice of 
having journalistic fact-checkers has 
existed for less than a century.
^
^ News organizations that have 
such strong commitments to fact-
checking—such as The New Yorker and 
Der Spiegel—are plausible examples 
of socially distributed cognitive 
processes that reliably convey 
accurate information. Unfortunately, 
however, such organizations are not 
the norm. In addition, the number 
of publications to invest in a full-
time fact-checking department has 
decreased significantly.
^
^ The relative scarcity as well as the 
decline of cultures of fact-checking 
at media institutions means that we 
can’t appeal to the practice of in-
house fact-checking to make a general 
claim about the reliable accuracy of 
media organizations. What should we 
say about the media more broadly? 
Is it possible to be optimistic about 
the sort of information that you can 
expect to receive when you consider 
the media landscape as a whole?
^
^ Only someone who hasn’t been 
paying attention to developments 
over the last decade or more would 
be that optimistic. However, some 
have pointed to the rise in popularity 
of external fact-checking media 
organizations as a strategy for 
improving the overall accuracy of 
media offerings. Might those sorts 
of external checks on other media 
organizations at least help improve 
overall accuracy?
T
he process involved in 
fact-checking is quite 
rigorous. Fact-checkers 
for The New Yorker are so 
obsessive that they even 
fact-check the cartoons 
and cover art, as well as the 
fiction and poetry. 
T
he German news 
magazine Der Spiegel 
has the largest fact-
checking department of any 
publication in the world. 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 21  Testimony in the Media

176
^
^ We have good reason to be skeptical 
about putting too much faith in 
external fact-checking organizations. 
The problem is that once we rely 
on an external fact-checking 
organization to weigh in on the 
accuracy of a particular story, we also 
need to rely on individual consumers 
to consult those fact-checking 
organizations alongside the original 
news source they used to get their 
information in the first place.
^
^ But there are multiple fact-checking 
organizations, and they often disagree 
about how to evaluate any particular 
story. In other words, by bringing in 
external fact-checking organizations, 
we are once again putting the 
responsibility on individuals to be 
able to assess information, gauge the 
relative strength of individual experts’ 
opinions, and then arrive at a reliably 
accurate assessment of the totality of 
the information on balance.
^
^ The CIA trains its analysts over the 
course of years to do that sort of 
assessment of source data. Trusting 
untrained people to do that same 
work is not a promising solution to the 
problem of unreliable source material.
^
^ Added to this is the further problem 
of source monitoring failures—the 
problem that we’re just not very good 
at remembering where we acquired a 
particular piece of information. For 
external fact-checking to even have 
a chance of working, people would 
have to read an individual story, stop, 
fact-check it using external resources, 
and then decide whether to believe 
it before going on to read the next 
individual story. And that’s just not a 
plausible scenario.
^
^ If that’s the situation, the more 
plausible answer is probably to 
despair that we can acquire much 
knowledge from media sources at all.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 21  Testimony in the Media

177
MULTIPLE MARKETS
^
^ Perhaps an alternative solution to 
external fact-checking organizations 
would be to simply let the market 
weed out the bad actors.
^
^ People think that what markets do 
is achieve the best-possible result at 
the best-possible price, but that is not 
exactly true. Even when they work 
well, markets achieve an optimal 
balance of the quality of the result 
and the cost of achieving that result. 
But even that isn’t exactly right, 
because it doesn’t tell us what aspects 
of a result count toward its quality.
^
^ A car, for example, has different 
measures of quality, including its fuel 
efficiency, its maximal speed, its peak 
acceleration, and the attractiveness 
of its exterior and interior design. 
How do we determine which of those 
features is going to count toward its 
quality?
^
^ The short answer is that we can’t. 
But one of the advantages of market 
thinking is that we don’t have to. In 
some sense, the market will do that 
for us: Whichever car sells best is the 
one that had the best combination of 
price and features.
^
^ But when we say “best,” all that 
means is popular with the consumers 
in that car-buying market. And here’s 
what that means: When you see what 
features the market rewards, you 
learn something about what sorts of 
features car buyers wanted, rather 
than gaining information about 
some sort of objective standard for 
assessing which car is best, all things 
considered.
^
^ And actually, as the case of the 
car indicates, there won’t be one 
combination of qualities and 
price that will uniquely appeal to 
consumers. Instead, there will be a 
range of different combinations of 
qualities and price to attract different 
subsets of the car market. So, the car 
market is segmented into different 
categories that appeal to those 
different types of consumers.
S
ome of the publications that adhere to norms of 
rigorous fact-checking include The New Yorker, 
Vanity Fair, Esquire, Wired, and Popular Mechanics.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 21  Testimony in the Media

178
^
^ We can compare a market for ideas 
to the market for cars, and what we 
see is that—in the case of science, at 
least—we don’t have the confusing 
range of qualities against which to 
measure the worth of an idea. So, 
unlike with cars, we don’t have the 
potential sources of quality that we 
have to weigh against each other.
^
^ In the case of science, the measure 
of the quality of an idea is whether 
it’s true or likely to be true. That is 
the one measure of quality against 
which we have to weigh the worth 
of an idea. That does seem like an 
advantage for science and one reason 
why we could say that in science the 
market is selecting for the truth of the 
ideas under consideration.
^
^ A complicating factor is that scientists 
and other researchers—including 
researchers in the humanities 
and social sciences—are actually 
participating in multiple markets at 
the same time. One sort of market 
is monetary, in which a researcher 
might be able to monetize his or her 
ideas and measure his or her success 
by the amount of money someone is 
willing to pay for him or her to pursue 
those ideas.
^
^ At the same time, researchers also 
participate in what economists call 
reputation markets, in which the 
measure of the success of an idea isn’t 
financial but reputational. It’s the 
quality of the reputation that the idea 
and the originator of that idea have 
among other practitioners in the field.
^
^ Furthermore, there can be other 
reputation markets in addition to the 
ones limited to individual academic 
fields. For example, certain high-
profile researchers can enjoy a 
reputation in society more generally.
^
^ The complication introduced by 
the fact that there are multiple 
markets is that there isn’t a strong 
connection between the monetary 
and reputational markets. It is often 
the case that someone’s ideas can 
be quite successful in reputation 
markets within his or her field 
without those ideas leading to 
corresponding financial success. And 
academic specialists will point out 
cases of their colleagues who have 
achieved financial success for their 
ideas without being able to achieve 
reputational success within their own 
field for those same ideas.
^
^ Unfortunately, once you consider 
what the market is aimed at 
maximizing, it does not seem that 
a focus on the media marketplace 
would give us any reason to be 
optimistic that market mechanisms 
will make media organizations 
better sources of reliably accurate 
information.
^
^ The reason for this is that what the 
media market is aimed at optimizing 
isn’t reliably accurate information. It 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 21  Testimony in the Media

179
aims at optimizing what it rewards—
either with money or reputation. 
And it’s geared toward rewarding 
whatever content can capture the 
attention of the greatest number of 
consumers.
^
^ What this means for the news media 
is that their goal is to maximize 
attention—because by maximizing 
attention, they can deliver consumers 
and data about those consumers 
to advertisers and other corporate 
customers.
^
^ This would not pose a problem if 
the way to maximize the attention 
of consumers was to provide them 
with a wealth of reliably accurate 
information. But that’s not necessarily 
what consumers want.
I
n his 2016 book review “They’ve Got You, Wherever 
You Are,” published in The New York Review of Books, 
Jacob Weisberg describes 
the problems created by the 
current media market using 
the example of Facebook.
His point is that making 
the media landscape more 
impoverished when it comes 
to sources of high-quality, 
reliable news may not be the 
intention of Facebook or any 
of the other big players in 
media markets. However, it 
is likely to be an unintended 
consequence, given that the market doesn’t seem to 
be geared toward rewarding that sort of high-quality, 
reliable news.

SOURCES YOU RELY ON
^
^ In order to assess whether you can 
acquire knowledge on the basis of 
your consumption of news media, 
we shouldn’t look at all news sources. 
Instead, we should look at the news 
sources that you actually rely on.
^
^ If you rely on The New Yorker and 
other sources that have strong 
journalistic traditions that emphasize 
accuracy, then you can acquire 
knowledge on the basis of relying on 
those sources.
^
^ Externalism about knowledge has to 
do with whether you actually possess 
knowledge, not whether you or 
anybody else is aware that you possess 
that knowledge. So, our focus on how 
we would figure out whether you have 
knowledge is a little misleading.
^
^ For the social externalist, in the 
case of your knowledge on the basis 
of reading a New Yorker article, 
what matters is whether relying on 
New Yorker articles is a good way to 
receive accurate information. It isn’t 
important that you know that The 
New Yorker is reliable, or even that 
you’re aware of that fact. Maybe you 
read it because you like the cartoons, 
but you also check out the articles. 
Or maybe you want to fit in with a 
group of people who are constantly 
discussing New Yorker articles.
^
^ The fact that you’re reading The New 
Yorker and that it’s a source of reliably 
accurate information is enough for 
you to acquire knowledge on the basis 
of your reading. And this result is seen 
in other well-established cases in the 
social sciences.
Y
our reliance 
on The New 
Yorker is a function 
of your position in 
a network of New 
Yorker readers and 
doesn’t at all depend

for—the fact that 
The New Yorker is 
a reliable source of

Pragmatic and Moral 
Encroachment
W
e have been treating the discussion of knowledge as 
only revolving around questions of truth likelihood. 
On this way of looking at knowledge, what matters 
for knowledge is truth and accuracy. In particular, 
nothing else about the knower—including whether 
he or she has an interest in the particular question 
he or she is considering—is relevant to the question 
of whether he or she knows. This way of looking at 
knowledge as being independent of the interests of 
the knower is the standard. However, recently there 
have been a number of challenges to the claim that 
we can evaluate whether someone knows purely 
on the basis of the truth likelihood of his or her 
belief. According to these new challenges, whether 
someone knows something can also depend on his 
or her interests.  

184

One challenge suggests that a person’s practical 
interests can impact whether he or she has 
knowledge. The other challenge suggests that a 
person’s moral concerns can impact whether he or 
she has knowledge. Though ultimately neither of 
these challenges will prove successful, both of them 
help illustrate not only the importance but also the 
limits of knowledge.
PRAGMATIC ENCROACHMENT
^
^ A particular sort of argument for 
the claim that a person’s practical 
interests can impact whether he or 
she counts as having knowledge 
has been advanced by philosophers 
Jeremy Fantl and Matthew McGrath. 
Other notable philosophers who have 
argued for related conclusions include 
John Hawthorne and Jason Stanley.
^
^ Fantl and McGrath’s argument goes 
under the heading of pragmatic 
encroachment, because it involves 
the conclusion that pragmatic, or 
practical concerns, influence or 
encroach upon questions of whether 
or not someone has knowledge.
^
^ The structure of Fantl and McGrath’s 
argument is very simple. Essentially, 
it rests on two planks: fallibilism and 
a practical condition on knowledge.
]
] Fallibilism is the claim that it 
is possible for someone to know 
something without having certain 
knowledge. Given the fact that 
we’ve adopted fallibilism as a 
working assumption for the bulk 
of these lectures—ever since we 
rejected Descartes’s extreme version 
of internalism—we’ll continue with 
the assumption that fallibilism is 
correct.
]
] According to the practical 
condition on knowledge, if you 
know some fact, then you are 
rational to act as if that fact is true.
^
^ When you combine fallibilism and 
the practical condition, you are forced 
to accept that whether or not someone 
has knowledge depends in part on his 
or her practical interests.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 22  Pragmatic and Moral Encroachment

185
^
^ It’s very plausible to think that 
whether it is rational to act as if 
some fact is true does vary according 
to your practical interests. The 
more significant the outcomes of a 
particular act are for you, the greater 
evidence you need in order to have 
reason to act.
^
^ But then, if that’s true, that would 
imply—because of the practical 
condition—that the evidence required 
for knowledge would also vary 
according to your practical interests.
^
^ That, however, just is the claim 
endorsed under the heading of 
pragmatic encroachment. That is 
because what this conclusion means 
is that whether or not you have 
knowledge can depend on the level 
of importance a fact has for you. 
The more important the fact is for 
you, the more evidence you would 
need in order to know that fact. For 
trivial facts, though, you could have 
knowledge with far less evidence.
^
^ Why should we accept the claim that 
whether it is rational for you to act 
as if a certain fact is true depends on 
your practical interests?
^
^ Suppose you believe that whenever 
you eat peanuts you get headaches—
not debilitating headaches, but 
annoying ones. If that’s the case, 
then you might want to look out on 
menus for a disclaimer stating that 
the restaurant does not use peanuts or 
peanut products in preparing its food. 
Once you see that disclaimer, you’ll 
feel comfortable ordering any dish on 
the menu.
^
^ Contrast that with a situation in 
which you have a severe peanut 
allergy, one so severe that you 
immediately go into anaphylactic 
shock when you come into contact 
with even the smallest amount of 
peanut or peanut oil. If that’s the case, 
then a mere disclaimer on a menu 
might not be enough for you to feel 
comfortable eating in that restaurant. 
Perhaps in that case you would need 
to speak to the restaurant manager, 
emphasize the severity of your 
condition, and then double-check to 
be sure the restaurant really uses no 
peanut products in their kitchen.
^
^ In the first case, we might say that 
you would be irrational to continue 
to ask about the use of peanuts in 
the kitchen after reading a clear 
disclaimer on the menu. In the second 
case, however, nobody would consider 
you to be irrational if you made 
absolutely sure that the kitchen didn’t 
use peanuts or peanut products.
^
^ This seems plausible. And if it’s 
correct, then it would suggest that 
whether or not your behavior counts 
as rational does depend on your 
practical interests.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 22  Pragmatic and Moral Encroachment

186
T
he more interest you have in the outcome of 
a particular question, the more rational it is 
for you to invest additional time in acquiring more 
evidence related to the outcome of that question.
^
^ So, if we’re going to block Fantl and 
McGrath’s argument that practical 
interests can influence whether or 
not you have knowledge, we’ll have 
to block the argument by focusing on 
the practical condition—the claim 
that if you have knowledge of some 
fact, then it’s rational to act as if that 
fact is true.
^
^ When the practical condition is 
stated like that, it might seem really 
obvious. However, there are some 
good reasons to be skeptical about the 
practical condition.
]
] It seems very plausible that 
many nonhuman animals have 
knowledge. When a hound tracks a 
fox to a particular tree, the hound 
can know that the fox is at that tree. 
At the same time, it is not plausible 
that most of the nonhuman animals 
that have knowledge are rational; 
in other words, the notion of 
rationality doesn’t really apply to 
those animals. Rather, it seems 
plausible to reserve the notion 
of rationality for creatures who 
can reflect on their reasons for 
behaving the way they do. To say 
that someone is behaving rationally 
is at least in part to say that, if 
the person reflects on his or her 
behavior, he or she would be able 
to explain that behavior to him- or 
herself on the basis of his or her 
reasons for acting. It’s no disrespect 
to the extraordinary cognitive 
abilities of nonhuman animals 
like dogs to suggest that they are 
incapable of such reflection. If 
that’s right, though, then such 
animals provide examples of 
creatures who have knowledge but 
do not act rationally. And if that’s 
right, then the practical condition 
is false.
]
] According to the practical 
condition, whenever you know 
something, then that is enough for 
you to be rational in acting as if 
it’s true. The problem is that this 
isn’t true. Sometimes you need 
more than mere knowledge to have 
reason to act.
^
^ It seems plausible that there are 
certain scenarios in which action 
requires more than mere knowledge. 
Sometimes, you have to go above and 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 22  Pragmatic and Moral Encroachment

187
beyond, acquiring evidence greater 
than what is required for knowledge.
^
^ Think again about the discussion of 
the menu disclaimer that the kitchen 
at the restaurant where you’re eating 
is peanut-free. If the restaurant goes 
to the trouble of indicating to you that 
it doesn’t use any peanuts or peanut 
products in the kitchen, then you can 
know that the restaurant’s kitchen is 
peanut-free.
^
^ However, if you have a deadly 
peanut allergy, it’s totally rational 
for you to speak to the manager to 
make absolutely sure that there are 
no peanuts or peanut products used 
in the kitchen. In fact, to go a step 
further, you shouldn’t eat at that 
restaurant until you double-check 
that they really don’t use any peanuts 
or peanut products in their kitchen.
^
^ If you’re willing to go that far, too, 
but you accept that the disclaimer in 
the menu is enough evidence for you 
to know that there are no peanuts or 
peanut products used in the kitchen, 
then you also must reject the practical 
condition. That’s because this would 
also be a case in which knowledge 
alone isn’t sufficient to provide you 
with reasons to act.
MORAL ENCROACHMENT
^
^ Fantl and McGrath argue that 
whether or not you have knowledge of 
some fact can depend in part on what 
practical significance that fact has for 
you. The more significant the fact, 
the more evidence you might need to 
have in order to know it. It’s this that 
they call pragmatic encroachment, 
because your pragmatic interests 
encroach on, or influence, the 
amount of knowledge you can have.
^
^ There is another form of 
encroachment that has begun to 
receive interest: the encroachment 
of moral concerns on evidence. In 
analogy to the notion of pragmatic 
encroachment, we could call this view 
moral encroachment. It’s the idea that 
the amount of evidence you need in 
order to have sufficient evidence to 
believe something depends in part on 
the moral implications of that belief.
^
^ To unpack the notion of moral 
encroachment, let’s emphasize that 
the idea of moral encroachment 
involves the suggestion that beliefs 
can have moral implications at all. 
And this may be hard for some people 
to accept.
^
^ To say that beliefs can have moral 
implications is at least in part to say 
that certain beliefs can be morally 
wrong. In other words, the idea is 
that over and above being able to 
assess a belief as being supported 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 22  Pragmatic and Moral Encroachment

188
or unsupported by the evidence, we 
can also assess at least certain beliefs 
based on their moral qualities.
^
^ If we accept the phenomenon of 
moral encroachment, we can’t limit 
appeals to that phenomenon to people 
we agree with.
^
^ Suppose, for example, we’re debating 
with someone who believes that his 
or her religious tradition forbids 
women to work outside of the home. 
Say we present strong evidence to 
this person that children raised by 
working mothers are as healthy, 
happy, intelligent, and well adjusted 
as children who are raised by stay-
at-home mothers. The person with 
whom we’re debating could refuse 
to accept that evidence as sufficient, 
citing the moral significance of his 
or her religious injunction against 
women working outside of the home. 
We could imagine analogous cases 
involving white supremacists, anti-
Semites, and so on.
^
^ The underlying point is that we have 
good reason to separate arguments 
about the strength of our evidence 
from arguments about the rightness 
of our causes wherever possible. Of 
course, humans are often guilty of 
rationalization and sloppy thinking, 
but this isn’t a reason not to try our 
best to shield our truth-directed 
investigations from our moralizing.
A
fter reviewing the arguments that considerations 
beyond simply the likelihood that our beliefs 
are true might be relevant to our evidence, it doesn’t 
seem that either of them is very promising.

LECTURE 23
Radical Skepticism: 
The Brain in a Vat
I
magine that one night after you’ve fallen asleep, an 
evil scientist breaks into your bedroom, gives you an 
anesthetic, and spirits you away to his secret lab. Once 
there, he removes your brain, keeping it functioning 
by placing it in a specially designed vat of nutrient 
solution. He runs electrodes to your brain from a bank of 
supercomputers, feeding your brain impulses identical 
to those your brain would receive from your body. When 
you wake up, everything will seem the same to you. 
You’ll go through your morning routine as you always do, 
feeling the water on your face when you wash up. What 
you won’t know, however, is that you’re no longer in that 
bedroom. You no longer have a face to wash. Instead, 
you’re now a brain floating in a vat of nutrient solution 
being fooled into thinking that you’re still waking up in 
your bedroom and going about your morning routine.

191
Skepticism
T
he word “skepticism” derives from the ancient Greek 
word skeptikos, which means “questioning” or 
“doubting.”
Many skeptical arguments are natural, everyday affairs—
such as when you question someone’s evidence for 
a particular opinion about sports, or art, or politics. 
Philosophical skeptical arguments are related to those 
everyday forms of skepticism, but philosophical skeptical 
arguments tend to be more general. They attack a 
whole type of evidence, such as perceptual evidence, or 
inductive evidence, or the evidence of testimony.
Generally, such arguments suggest that the evidence in 
question isn’t good enough to give us knowledge. For 
example, skepticism about sense perception suggests 
that the senses fool us into thinking they are providing 
us with evidence about the world around us. In reality, 
the skeptic suggests, the senses offer us only a false 
promise. The evidence that the senses provide is in fact 
not sufficient to support knowledge of the world that 
sense experience seems to describe.
Other types of skepticism work similarly. Whether you’re 
dealing with skepticism about the existence of other 
minds or the existence of God, the nature of skeptical 
arguments is to question whether the evidence available 
is sufficient to support knowledge or belief.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 23  Radical Skepticism: The Brain in a Vat

192
THE BRAIN-IN-A-VAT SCENARIO
^
^ Let’s turn this brain-in-a-vat scenario 
into a skeptical argument, the 
conclusion of which will be that you 
can’t have any knowledge of the world 
that you think you perceive.
^
^ Let’s consider a very obvious claim 
about the world that you believe to 
know through perception. Take, 
for example, the claim that you 
have hands.
1	 If you know that you have hands, 
then you know that you’re not a 
(handless) brain in a vat.
2	 You don’t know that you’re not a 
brain in a vat.
3	 Therefore, you don’t know that 
you have hands.
^
^ But the claim that you have hands 
was chosen because it was an obvious 
claim about the world you think 
you know through perception. So, if 
the argument leads you to conclude 
that you don’t even know that claim, 
then the argument would seem to be 
applicable to pretty much any claim 
about the world that you take yourself 
to perceive.
^
^ At least initially, the argument seems 
pretty strong. It has the structure 
of a valid argument. Furthermore, 
the two steps of the argument seem 
unimpeachable.
^
^ The first step of the argument seems 
plausible. Certainly, if you know that 
you have hands, then among other 
things you know that you’re not some 
handless brain floating in a vat of 
nutrient solution.
^
^ The second step of the argument also 
seems pretty strong. However the 
world seems to you right now, it would 
seem exactly the same even if you were 
merely a disembodied brain floating 
in a vat of nutrient solution and being 
fed experiences by an evil scientist. 
For this reason, you might think that 
you can’t rule out the possibility you 
actually are a disembodied brain 
floating in a vat. And if you can’t rule 
out that possibility, then surely you 
can’t know that you’re not in fact such 
a disembodied brain.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 23  Radical Skepticism: The Brain in a Vat

193
^
^ But if the argument is valid and if 
each of the steps of the argument is 
plausible, then we must accept the 
conclusion. So, it would seem that 
we must accept skepticism about the 
world as perceived through our senses.
^
^ Or must we? If we’re going to 
resist the external world skepticism 
prompted by the brain-in-a-vat 
argument, we must either reject 
one or both of the two steps or we 
must demonstrate that, despite 
appearances, the argument isn’t in 
fact valid after all.
^
^ Contemporary philosophers have 
pursued all three of these strategies, 
and each has something to teach us.
THE EXTERNALIST RESPONSE
^
^ Externalists argue that facts about 
your situation—facts of which you 
are not aware—make a difference 
with respect to your evidence. So, two 
people who are the same with respect 
to the way the world seems to them can 
in fact have different levels of evidence.
^
^ If this is right, then the externalist 
can reject the skeptical argument by 
rejecting the second step. You do in 
fact know that you’re not a brain in a 
vat, assuming in fact that you really 
are a normally embodied human 
in your standard environment, 
perceiving the world through your 
bodily sense organs.
^
^ One of the problems with the 
externalist response to the brain-in-a-
vat argument is that if it is correct, it 
can seem mysterious why skepticism 
ever seemed so challenging in the first 
place. In order to have an explanation 
for this, we need to look at two other 
responses to the skeptic.
T
wo of the most famous discussions in the history of 
philosophy revolve around skepticism: Descartes’s 
discussion of the evil demon and skepticism about our 
knowledge of the external world, and Hume’s skepticism 
about the possibility of using induction to gain 
knowledge of relations of cause and effect.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 23  Radical Skepticism: The Brain in a Vat

194
THE RELEVANT ALTERNATIVES VIEW
^
^ The first of the two remaining 
responses rejects the first premise of 
the skeptical argument. It might seem 
outrageous to reject this premise. Isn’t 
it just logic?
^
^ A number of philosophers, foremost 
among them Robert Nozick and 
Fred Dretske, have questioned 
whether rejecting this premise is 
actually as outrageous as it might first 
appear. Nozick and Dretske reject 
the principle that underlies the first 
premise of the skeptical argument, 
called the closure of knowledge under 
known entailment.
S
uppose you know the proposition that p. And 
suppose you further know that if p is true, then 
q is true—that is, that p entails q. It’s plausible to 
suppose that you then also know the proposition 
that q is true.
For example, suppose you know that Georgina went 
to Caltech. And suppose you further know that if 
Georgina went to Caltech, then she has certainly 
mastered basic arithmetic. Then, it’s plausible to 
suppose that you also know that Georgina has 
certainly mastered basic arithmetic.
This is the principle that knowledge is closed under 
known entailment: If you know some claim and you 
know that that claim entails some further claim, then 
you know the further claim as well.
Although this claim seems extremely plausible, it’s 
the claim that Nozick and Dretske want to reject.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 23  Radical Skepticism: The Brain in a Vat

195
^
^ They suggest that what’s more 
plausible than the closure of 
knowledge under known entailment is 
this: When you have knowledge, that 
knowledge lets you rule out relevant 
alternatives that are incompatible 
with what you know. That’s why the 
Nozick-Dretske view can plausibly be 
called a relevant alternatives view.
^
^ They don’t think that skeptical 
scenarios, for example, ever count 
as relevant alternatives. So, even 
though you know you have hands, 
you don’t know the claim “if you have 
hands, then you’re not a brain in a 
vat”—because the possibility that you 
are a brain in a vat is not a relevant 
alternative to your actual situation.
^
^ Nozick and Dretske reject the 
closure of knowledge under known 
entailment and replace it with the 
relevant alternatives view.
^
^ If that’s right, though, then you 
have reason to reject the skeptical 
argument, even if you sympathize 
with the claim that you don’t know 
you’re not a brain in a vat. You can 
reject the argument, because you think 
the radical skeptical scenario is not 
relevant to your real-world knowledge 
that you have hands, despite the fact 
that having hands isn’t compatible 
with being a brain in a vat—and you 
know that it’s not compatible.
^
^ The relevant alternatives view gives 
you a way to concede to the skeptic 
that you have no way to refute radical 
skeptical claims but nevertheless to 
hang on the everyday knowledge that 
you know yourself to have.
CONTEXTUALISM
^
^ For many philosophers, rejecting 
the closure of knowledge under 
entailment is a step too far. They just 
don’t find it plausible that you could 
know some claim and know that that 
claim entails some other claim yet fail 
to know the entailed claim.
^
^ For those philosophers, there is 
an alternate theory that employs 
intuitions similar to the ones Nozick 
and Dretske appeal to but that doesn’t 
require that you reject the closure of 
knowledge under entailment.
^
^ The new theory suggests that 
Nozick and Dretske were wrong to 
apply their intuition to a particular 
premise—the first premise—of the 
skeptical argument. Instead, the 
new theory says we should apply 
the operating intuition that Nozick 
and Dretske appeal to the skeptical 
argument as a whole.
^
^ Consider a normal, everyday scenario 
in which you’re not thinking about 
skepticism. Say you’re thinking about 
purchasing gloves. In a scenario 
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 23  Radical Skepticism: The Brain in a Vat

196
like that, you’d obviously know you 
have hands—you’re contemplating 
purchasing a new pair of gloves. In 
such a normal scenario, you also 
know, although merely unconsciously, 
that if you have hands, you’re not a 
brain in a vat. This new theory says 
that in such an everyday scenario, you 
also know, also merely unconsciously, 
that you’re not a brain in a vat.
^
^ Now consider a scenario where you’re 
arguing explicitly with a skeptic. 
In this scenario, you know—now 
consciously—that if you know you 
have hands, then you know you’re 
not a brain in a vat. But now, because 
you’re consciously considering the 
skeptical possibilities, you don’t know 
that you’re not a brain in a vat. So 
now, when you’re arguing with the 
skeptic, you don’t know that you 
have hands.
^
^ In other words, on this new theory, 
what you know varies according 
to the situation in which you find 
yourself—your knowledge varies 
according to your context. For this 
reason, this view of knowledge is 
called contextualism.
^
^ The advantage of contextualism 
is that it explains the intuitive pull 
of skepticism without forcing us to 
abandon the idea that we can use 
inference to extend the scope of our 
knowledge unrestrictedly.
^
^ The contextualist distinguishes 
between high-stakes and low-stakes 
cases and suggests that what is 
different between the two is the level 
of evidence you need to have in order 
to have knowledge. In the high-
stakes case, you need a higher level of 
evidence, while in the low-stakes case, 
you need a lower level of evidence.
^
^ The views of contextualism and 
pragmatic encroachment—and the 
arguments used to support them—
are parallel. But while pragmatic 
encroachment deals with the 
connection between knowledge, 
rationality, and action, contextualism 
deals with the connection between 
knowledge and your ability to assert 
that you have knowledge. The 
contextualist suggests that in high-
stakes cases, you need much higher 
levels of evidence to be able to assert 
that you have knowledge.
^
^ One reason the contextualist answer 
to the skeptic is not one we should 
adopt is that the same arguments 
that we made against pragmatic 
encroachment also speak against 
coherentism. It might be that despite 
the fact that you have knowledge, 
you need higher levels of evidence 
to assert your knowledge in high-
stakes cases. But in the context of 
skepticism, perhaps the central 
reason for rejecting contextualism 
is that as an answer to the skeptic, 
the contextualist response is not a 
refutation—instead, it’s a capitulation.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 23  Radical Skepticism: The Brain in a Vat

197
^
^ Think about the contextualist 
explanation of what goes on when 
confronted with a skeptical argument. 
According to the contextualist, 
whenever the skeptic raises his or 
her skeptical worries, we no longer 
have the knowledge that we would 
in nonskeptical contexts. In other 
words, rather than showing how the 
skeptic is misguided, as far as the 
contextualist is concerned, the skeptic 
always wins every argument.
^
^ If the goal is to explain where 
the skeptic has gone astray, the 
contextualist response is disastrous.
^
^ Luckily, we can take advantage of the 
positive aspects of the contextualist 
explanation of the strength of 
skeptical arguments without 
conceding everything to the skeptic 
that the contextualist does.
^
^ In order to explain the cases, we 
don’t need to say that you lack 
knowledge in the high-stakes case. 
Instead, we can say that what you 
lack in the high-stakes case is the 
evidence sufficient for confidence, or 
assurance. So, the high-stakes case, 
on this alternate explanation, would 
be one where you have knowledge 
but lack the confidence or assurance 
to assert your knowledge. This is a 
way to repurpose the refutation of 
pragmatic encroachment as a strategy 
for rejecting contextualism as well.
^
^ This alternate explanation also allows 
us to explain what is happening in 
skeptical cases without capitulating to 
the skeptic. When the skeptic raises 
his or her doubts, the context becomes 
one in which we are no longer capable 
of asserting with assurance that we 
have knowledge. However—unlike in 
the contextualist explanation—this 
alternate explanation does not require 
that we grant that we no longer have 
knowledge. Instead, we can say that 
we still have knowledge when arguing 
with the skeptic, even if we cannot 
confidently defend the knowledge 
that we possess.

LECTURE 24
The Future of 
Epistemology
T
he sources of knowledge can roughly be divided 
into personal and social sources. Epistemology can 
contribute to the study of each of these types of 
sources, and the future contributions of epistemology 
in these areas can help us recognize that all of the 
major theories of knowledge found in this course—
foundationalism, coherentism, and externalism—have 
a role to play in the future development of the field.

T
he lectures in this course have covered a lot 
of material, but there is a wealth of material 
that exists that the course could not cover. Two 
of the most active current areas of research in 
epistemology might spark your interest in exploring 
the field further after you conclude these lectures.
v
v The success of Timothy Williamson’s book 
Knowledge and Its Limits points to a renewed 
interest in epistemology in using formal, logical, 
and mathematical methods to clarify problems. 
This subfield within epistemology is called formal 
epistemology.
v
v In 2007, philosophy professor Miranda Fricker 
published a book entitled Epistemic Injustice: Power 
and the Ethics of Knowing, in which she suggests 
the phenomenon that she terms epistemic injustice 
comes in two forms: testimonial injustice and 
hermeneutical injustice.
w
w Testimonial injustice harms speakers because it 
prevents them from being believed for reasons 
having to do with prejudice, rather than for valid 
reasons having to do with their qualities as honest 
or reliably accurate informants.
w
w Hermeneutical injustice harms people because 
it prevents them from correctly interpreting or 
recognizing facts about themselves or about their 
situation.

PERSONAL SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE
^
^ Personal sources of knowledge include 
self-awareness, sense perception, 
rational reflection, and deductive and 
inductive inference.
^
^ As noted in the discussion of each 
of those sources of knowledge in 
previous lectures, present research in 
philosophy benefits from extensive 
cross-pollination with the scientific 
fields investigating these phenomena. 
In fact, it is very unusual nowadays 
to find a philosopher working on 
epistemology and sense perception, 
for example, who isn’t conversant with 
current work on the neuroscience of 
vision. Similarly, the best work on the 
epistemology of memory is informed 
by the latest studies in the cognitive 
psychology and neurobiology 
of memory.
^
^ For example, for more than a decade, 
philosopher Gilbert Harman and 
electrical engineer Sanjeev Kulkarni 
have been collaborating on joint 
research. Since the beginning of their 
collaboration, they have coauthored 
two books: Reliable Reasoning: 
Induction and Statistical Learning 
Theory and An Elementary Introduction 
to Statistical Learning Theory.
^
^ Statistical learning theory is at the 
root of contemporary approaches to 
machine learning and is fundamental 
to the use of artificial intelligence in 
applications in image recognition, 
speech recognition, medical 
diagnostics, and finance. When 
Facebook tags your face in a friend’s 
post or when you speak to your smart 
home speaker, you have statistical 
learning theory to thank for those 
applications.
^
^ Harman’s collaboration with 
Kulkarni is just one example of the 
ways in which epistemologists have 
directly or indirectly influenced the 
development of disciplines in related 
fields, from cognitive science to 
computer science.
SOCIAL SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE
^
^ In the study of personal sources of 
knowledge, epistemologists have a 
long tradition of contributing behind 
the scenes to the development of 
many of the cognitive and behavioral 
sciences. However, some of the most 
exciting work for epistemologists in 
the future will perhaps relate to the 
investigation of the social sources of 
knowledge.

^
^ One case builds on the consideration 
of the media in a previous 
lecture. Current examinations of 
misinformation and so-called fake 
news tend to focus on the ways that 
individual media consumers can 
guard themselves against the effects 
of misinformation. Primarily, the 
suggestion is that media consumers 
need to become better at critical 
thinking skills.
^
^ For example, a Forbes magazine 
article from February 2018 entitled 
“How to Maintain Critical Thinking 
in the Modern World of New Media” 
provides a list of tips for ways that 
readers can become more critically 
savvy. But if you remember the 
discussion of social psychology and 
testimony from a previous lecture, 
you’ll know that attempts to improve 
people’s ability to detect deception 
and inaccurate information just aren’t 
very effective.
^
^ The lesson from the discussion of 
testimony in a previous lecture was 
that there is no reason to think that 
a solution to the problem of accurate 
information transmission will be 
focused on individual consumers of 
that information. Instead, we ought 
to look at social and institutional 
remedies.
^
^ The subfield concerned with 
these sorts of questions—social 
epistemology—is a growing research 
area in epistemology that is still 
in its infancy. One of the giants in 
the field is philosophy professor 
Alvin Goldman, who, in his book 
Knowledge in a Social World, argues 
for a position that he terms veritistic 
social epistemology. In fact, social 
externalism is a form of veritistic 
social epistemology.
^
^ Although it was published in 1999, 
Goldman’s book contains a wealth 
of discussions that are still relevant 
to our media landscape today. For 
example, Goldman discusses a 
proposal to use strategic tax policy 
to alleviate the effects of advertising 
influences on print media like 
newspapers and magazines.
^
^ Let’s modify that discussion for the 
contemporary media landscape. The 
goal is to increase the amount of 
reliably accurate information in the 
information marketplace.
V
eritistic” comes 
from the Latin 
word for truth, veritas. 
Veritistic social 
epistemology suggests 
that we should evaluate 
social institutions and 
processes to see whether 
they reliably contribute 
to the acquisition of true 
beliefs by individuals.

Lecture 24  The Future of Epistemology

^
^ Currently, content purveyors like 
Google and Facebook profit from, 
to put it bluntly, selling their users 
to advertisers. However, traditional 
news sources still produce much 
of the content that Google and 
Facebook provide. In other words, 
the traditional news sources are 
producing the content, but Google 
and Facebook are receiving the 
advertising revenue. This is not a 
sustainable model.
^
^ One potential solution would be to 
treat news content analogously to 
music content. Each time you listen 
to a song on Spotify or iTunes, the 
artist gets a percentage of the profit 
that Spotify or iTunes receives from 
you. Something similar could work 
in the case of news organizations: 
Each time a user of Facebook or 
Google reads a news story, the news 
organization that produced the story 
could receive a percentage of the 
advertising revenue that Facebook or 
Google earned on the story.
^
^ One of the problems with 
this suggestion is that 
although it would provide 
increased financial security 
for traditional news media 
sources, it would create 
other problems. For 
example, it might increase 
the already-existing 
pressure on those sources 
to produce clickbait-style 
content in order to drive the new 
revenue stream from Google and 
Facebook. From a truth-oriented 
perspective, that would certainly not 
be welcome.
^
^ These issues are challenging. 
Nevertheless, there are two 
advantages to the systems-oriented 
approach.
]
] The alternative—focusing on 
making individuals more rational 
and reflective—isn’t very promising. 
You can’t fight human nature!
]
] There are ways that systemic 
changes can produce positive 
truth-oriented effects. For example, 
the institution of cultures of fact-
checking in American publications 
in the 1920s led to some more-
reliable media institutions.
^
^ The problem of the spread of 
misinformation is a systemic problem. 
And as with so many of the systemic 
challenges that we face—from global 
climate change to infectious disease 
prevention—we will need to find 
systemic solutions as opposed to 
individual approaches.

A FRAMEWORK FOR THINKING 
ABOUT VIEWS OF KNOWLEDGE
^
^ We’ve seen two different ways 
to think about the structure of 
knowledge: the opposition between 
foundationalism and coherentism, 
and the clash between internalism 
and externalism. There is a way to 
reconcile some of these oppositions 
and take advantage of some of the 
best features of these views.
^
^ To do this, let’s borrow a set of ideas 
from philosophy professor Ernest 
Sosa. In a highly influential essay 
entitled “The Raft and the Pyramid,” 
published in 1980, Sosa suggests that 
the best explanation of the structure 
of knowledge would combine 
elements from both foundationalism 
and coherentism. Basically, the 
structure that Sosa advocated 
involved having a foundational 
substructure supporting a coherentist 
superstructure.
^
^ In recent decades, in a series of books 
and articles, Sosa has reworked that 
earlier picture. His new emphasis is 
on a distinction between two types 
of knowledge that he refers to as 
animal and reflective knowledge. 
Roughly, on this new picture, we 
should think of animal knowledge as 
foundationalist and externalist, while 
reflective knowledge is internalist and 
more coherentist.
^
^ Sosa had the right idea but was 
thinking at the wrong scale. He thinks 
that the way to integrate coherentism, 
foundationalism, and externalism 
is by looking at a single individual 
thinker. That thinker has, according 
to Sosa, animal knowledge—his or 
her core, foundational knowledge. 
That type of knowledge is knowledge 
we should understand by appealing 
to externalism. Then, Sosa continues, 
the thinker has a higher level of 
knowledge that is validated by 
reflection. And Sosa thinks we should 
understand that type of knowledge 
at least in part using the resources of 
coherentism.
^
^ In contrast, when it comes to 
knowledge, we should understand 
individual human knowledge largely 
on the model of externalism. Most 
human thinkers are not very reliable 
when it comes to rational reflection 
and shaping their beliefs into a truth-
conducive, coherent whole.
^
^ Remember, if we’re talking about 
knowledge, it’s not enough merely 
that you have coherent beliefs. 
Instead, the sort of coherence you 
achieve also has to lead to truth. 
That’s a very high bar, and probably 
not many people can actually 
achieve that.
Theories of Knowledge
Lecture 24  The Future of Epistemology

205
^
^ Instead, what Sosa calls reflective 
knowledge happens at the level 
of groups, social processes, and 
institutions. The best scientific 
research groups and the most 
respected journalistic organizations 
are examples of how groups can 
achieve the sort of reflective processes 
that are conducive to truth.
^
^ The role of internalist foundationalism 
and coherentism, then, will be in 
studying the kinds of processes that, 
when implemented at a systemic level, 
are likely to lead to truth.
^
^ Of course, we shouldn’t stop there. 
Here, too, empirical disciplines will 
have a role to play in testing whether 
implementing those processes actually 
does help with our truth-seeking 
goals and will also help us determine 
if there are other unforeseen costs 
that might outweigh the benefits of 
achieving those truth-seeking goals.
^
^ What we’re left with, then, is a sort of 
epistemology that is both externalist 
and foundationalist and coherentist. 
It is also an epistemology that sees 
its role in collaboration with the 
natural and social sciences. With 
all of the challenges to knowledge 
posed by contemporary life, it is a 
sort of epistemology that has a lot of 
work to do.
