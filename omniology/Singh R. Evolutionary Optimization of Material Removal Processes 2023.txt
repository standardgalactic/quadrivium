Introduction     
Evolutionary algorithms-based prediction and optimization often perform 
well, resembling solutions to all types of industrial issues as they ideally do 
not make any supposition about the fundamental fitness landscape. Over a 
period of time, it is desired to make the existing manufacturing smarter and 
more sustainable by the proper implementation of numerous well-proven 
mathematical modeling and nature-inspired algorithm-based prediction and 
optimizations namely as; particle swarm optimization, ant bee colony, 
teacher-learner based optimization, jaya algorithm, genetic algorithm, arti-
ficial neural network, fuzzy-based multi-criterion decision-making ap-
proaches, etc. while attempting the tasks at the real-life level. 
This book offers a detailed structure of evolutionary or nature-inspired 
optimization approaches broadly employed to model and optimize the 
various types of advanced and traditional machining processes, fabrication, 
and allied methods. The different statistical methods and evolutionary ap-
proaches applied for the purpose to optimize the single and/or multiple 
objectives for overall enhancement of process quality and improvement by 
making the advanced machining solutions more sustainable are covered in 
this book. Furthermore, the various recent and latest research and devel-
opment works in the broad domain of material removal processes have also 
been reported by emphasizing real-life case study-based elaborations. In 
addition, the readers will also be able to develop these processes more 
sustainably and reliably by making an effective implementation of evolu-
tionary approaches for modeling and optimization in the broad domain of 
machining of various engineering materials. 
This book will further edify its readers about the current and latest 
research interests going on around the globe in the field of various ma-
terial removal processes and its allied domains. The recent advancements 
in numerous machining practices offer several fruitful solutions while 
processing of the latest and difficult-to-machine materials used in dif-
ferent industrial sectors will also be focused on. The ongoing research in 
the broad domain of electric discharge machining, abrasive jet machining, 
turning operation, wire-cut EDM, hybrid machining, electrochemical 
machining, micro-electrochemical machining, high-speed drilling, CNC

1.1 INTRODUCTION 
The heterogeneous materials (composites) are a shared mixture of two or 
extra micro-constituents that are different in chemical composition 
and substantial form and are not soluble in all others. Fiber glass com-
posites are economic materials that replace many of the materials used in 
DOI: 10.1201/9781003258421-2

industries. The FRPs are difficult to machine due to the arrangement of 
fibers. Discontinuity is established in the fiber due to how machining 
affects the performance of the part (Abrate and Walton, 1992). Konig 
et al. (1985) found that protruding fiber tips in composites can give in-
correct outcomes. 
Glass fiber–reinforced plastic is extensively used in applications such as 
buildings, piping, and robots. The advantages are high fracture toughness, 
thermal resistance, and corrosion. There are many methods for machining 
composite materials, such as ultrasonic machining, laser cutting, and EDM. 
The lower rate of production is the disadvantage of non-conventional 
machining. So, conventional machining processes for machining composite 
materials still find a wider acceptance. The mechanism of material removal 
rate in composite material is different from metals. The special considera-
tion must be given to the wear resistance of the tool while machining fiber- 
reinforced materials. Hence, suitable cutting tool materials used are carbide 
and diamond tools (Davim and Reis, 2004). 
1.2 LITERATURE REVIEW 
Santhanakrishnan et al. (1989) studied turning of Kevlar fiber, GFRP, and 
CFRP composite using a K20 carbide and HSS tool. The performance of a 
K20 carbide tool for machining fiber-reinforced plastic composites was better 
than others. Palanikumar et al. (2006) optimized particular cutting pressure, 
tool wear, and surface smoothness throughout the turning of glass FRP 
composites with a carbide tool. Fiber orientation of workpiece, depth, feed, 
speed, and machining time were considered for the minimization of surface 
roughness. The machining performance obtained was superior when more 
parameters and levels were considered. 
Isik (2008) obtained the results of the machining of UD-GFRP and the 
most favorable cutting parameters were recommended to acquire a desired 
surface quality. Surinder Kumar et al. (2013) studied the machinability of 
UD-GFRP via a K10 carbide cutting tool. Six parameters were considered in 
the MRR and to diminish surface roughness by ANOVA. Utility function was 
significantly affected by speed, DOC (depth of cut), and feed. Hussain et al. 
(2011) utilized Taguchi’s L25 OA for experiments and fuzzy logic for 
modeling during the turning of GFRP using a K20 carbide tool. Parveen Raj 
et al. (2012) used mathematical modeling and ANN modeling to expect 
delaminating and surface roughness while end milling of the GFRP. The hand 
layup process was used to construct specimens of eight-layered UD-GFRP. 
The tools used were carbide K10 (solid) and titanium coated carbide end mill. 
Tool material, feed, speed, and depth of cut were the parameters for study. 
Farhad and Mahdi (2008) used simulated annealing to optimize the turning 
parameters while machining of cylindrical workpieces. The goal was to 
minimize the total cost. Seven constraints were used. Yang et al. (2009) used 
4 Evolutionary Optimization of Material Removal Processes 

simulated annealing for parameter value selection for an electric discharge 
process by minimizing surface roughness. 
Several techniques to resolve optimization issues found in the literature 
are gravitational search algorithm (Esmat et al. 2009), gray wolf algorithm 
(Mirjalili et al., 2014), simulated annealing algorithm (Suman and Kumar, 
2006), etc. These are non-deterministic methods that are used to find op-
timum solution in complex problems, as it is difficult to explore whole 
domains of possible solutions in a reasonable time by conventional 
methods (Battle, 2008). These algorithms have been useful to a large range 
of applications. 
In this research work, PSO, GSA, and PSOGSA are compared to discover 
the best possible parameters for turning of a UD-GFRP composite. PSO is a 
universal optimization method that has been suggested by Eberhart and 
Kennedy based on the flock of animals and school of catch fish (Eberhart 
and Kennedy, 1995). 
Esmat et al. (2009) used GSA to resolve optimization problems. There 
have been modifications in the algorithm of GSA since its introduction. 
GSA has beena solution to the diversity of applications. Various variants of 
GSA are available that enhance the original version. A number of custo-
mized versions of GSA introduced are nonstop, binary-valued, triple- 
valued, separate, restraint, multi-objective, and multimodal. In GSA, the 
gravitational force transfers information between different masses. The 
results obtained by GSA are better quality and comparable with RGA, PSO, 
and CFO. Esmat Rashedi et al. (2011) used GSA to put up a pass through a 
filter modeling and compared it with PSO and GA and the outcome showed 
that GSA performed better than PSO and GA. The performance in the 
exploration and exploitation was improved. However, in recent times, GSA 
has been criticized because it is considered that it is not truly based on the 
gravitational law. Debkalpa Goswami and Shankar Chakraborty (2015) 
applied the fireworks algorithm (FWA) and gravitational search algorithm 
on behalf of optimization of the USM process. It was noticed that the FWA 
provides the best possible results for the USM process. 
Sajad A.R. and Shanthi B. (2020) solved the problem of mechanical design 
by chaotic gravitational search algorithm (CSGA). The CGSA gave the effi-
cient performance in terms of optimization of design variable, convergence 
speed, handling of constraints, and minimization of cost function compared 
to other algorithms. Mirjalili et al. (2010) developed the latest hybrid 
population-based algorithm (PSOGSA) that integrates local search capability 
of GSA with social thinking of PSO to optimize the benchmark problems. 
In this work, the influence of DOC, environment, speed, feed, nose 
radius, and rake angle on the surface irregularity during turning has been 
considered. The design of experiments by Taguchi is used to measure 
surface roughness. Only significant parameters are mathematically mod-
eled. The objective function is the mathematical model to be optimized by 
GSA, PSO, and PSOGSA. PSOGSA overcame the problem of premature 
Study of SR for Turning of UD‐GFRP Composite 5 

convergence of PSO (Gao et al., 2008). PSOGSA obtained the best cutting 
conditions and tool geometry. 
1.3 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 
The Taguchi L18 orthogonal array (OA) with 17 (21*37) degree of freedom 
is used. The nose radius is kept at two levels and other variables are kept at 
three levels. To assign the process variables, a linear graph is used. The 
process parameter and their ranges and symbols are presented in Table 1.1. 
The 18 tests used all have six parameters assigned to columns 1 toward 6, 
as indicated in Table 1.2.

Specimens with glass (75±5%) and epoxy resin (25±5%) are made, as 
shown in Figure 1.1. The details of UD-GFRP specimens are modulus of 
elasticity 320 N/mm2, weight of rod 2.300 kg, shear strength 255 N/mm2, 
length 840 mm, reinforcement UD (E’ Glass Roving), diameter 42 mm, 
density 1.95–2.1 gm/cc, and water absorption 0.07%. The geometry of the 
cutting bit used is as follows: nose radius (0.4 mm, 0.8 mm), rake angle 
[−6°, 0°, +6°,] and front clearance 10°. The Tokyo Seimitsu Surf-com 130A 
type instrument is used to measure surface irregularity (Ra). The transverse 
length of 4 mm is used to set up a carry on a length of 0.8 mm. 
1.4 METHODOLOGY 
Experimental data is collected using the Taguchi approach. The second-order 
model is developed using experimental data. The objective function i.e. 
mathematical model is optimized using GSA, PSO, and PSOGSA approaches.

and finely organized (Rose, 1996). In order to achieve this, an Ishikawa 
diagram is made, as shown in Figure 1.2. 
1.4.2 Multiple Regression Methodology 
(Douglas Montogomery et al., 2001) Mathematical models using single and 
multiple regressions analysis are developed for surface roughness, Ra. The 
regression equation correlates the dependent variables with the independent 
variables, such as DOC, cutting environment, feed, cutting speed, rake 
angle, and tool nose radius. The first-order model gave low predictability

i.e. high prediction error for measured responses. So, a second-order model 
is used for regression analysis (Douglas Montogomery et al., 2001). 
1.4.3 Gravitational Search Algorithm 
GSA is a metaheuristic algorithm motivated by Newton’s law of gravity and 
motion and is utilized to work out optimization issues. Gravity is one of the 
four essential connections in life (Schutz, 2003). Each element in the space 
attracts another particle with a force in inverse proportion to the square of 
distance between them and in proportion to M1*M2. The masses follow the 
law of gravity and motion, as given in Equations (1.1) and (1.2), respectively.

Where F: the gravitational force, G: gravitational constant, M1 and M2: the 
mass of the initial and next particle, and R: the span between the two 
masses. In GSA, each mass has four terms associated with it: active mass, 
passive mass, inertial mass, and position (Esmat Rashedi et al., 2009). The 
steps of GSA are as follows:  
Step 1. Initialization of particles 
The particles are initialized at random.

d is the value of the ith particle for the dth variable, while n is the 
number of variables and N is the population size.  
Step 2. Fitness evaluation and best fitness computation 
The excellent and most undesirable solutions are found at each 
iteration. 
For Minimization: 
N
best(t) = min fit (t) where j {1, …
}

(1.4)

(1.7)  
fitj(t) is the condition of the jth agent at iteration t, best(t) is the top 
fitness obtained at iteration t, worst(t) is the most unfavorable 
condition at iteration t.  
Step 3. Gravitational constant (G) computation (Chatterjee, 2011):

GO and α are initialized that reduces with the iterations. The 
iterations are specified by T.

Mpi and Mai are the passive and active masses, while Mii is the in-
ertia mass of the ith particle

At tth iteration, acceleration of the ith agents is found as:

d(t) is the force acting on particle i from particle j in the dth di-
rection at the tth iteration. Rij(t) is the Euclidian span between two 
particles, i and j, at the iteration t. G(t) is the gravitational constant 
at the tth iteration. ε is a very small constant.  
Step 6. Velocity and position of particles: 
Velocity and the location of the particle at the (t+1) iteration is found 
based on the subsequent equations:

Repeat steps 2–6 until the iterations arrive at their upper bound. At the final 
iteration, the best fitness gives global fitness and the position of particle 
gives global solution. Figure 1.3 shows the algorithm of GSA. 
1.4.4 Particle Swarm Optimization 
Each particle in the swarm represents the candidate solution for the pro-
blem. In PSO, each particle changes its position and moves to the latest 
situation and memories of the top location encountered and the top posi-
tion of neighbors to move towards the universal minimum. PSO is a 
computationally efficient, uncomplicated concept. PSO is a flexible method 
that improves the local exploitation and global abilities. The principle of 
the PSO algorithm is as follows (Esmin et al., 2005). The PSO consists of a 
swarm with N particles in a d-dimension (i.e. d variables). The location and 
speed of individuals are described as:

In hybrid PSOGSA (Seyedali Mirjalili, 2010), the functionality of both are 
combined. In this, the local search capability of GSA is combined with the 
social thinking of PSO. These algorithms are combined and the equation for 
velocity and position is given by Equations (1.20–1.21).

1.5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Table 1.3 shows the 18 trial conditions and surface roughness, Ra, for ex-
perimental parameter combination. The average (Ra) of 1.570 µm is achieved 
in experiment 17 at DOC of 0.2 mm, cooled cutting environment, speed 
of 55.42 m/min, feed of 0.1 mm/rev, rake angle of +6°, and nose radius of 
0.8 mm. Combination of cooled environment, moderate feed, lowest speed, 
and DOC and largest rake angle and nose radius resulted in a better surface 
finish. The response table for surface irregularity (Ra) is shown in Table 1.4. 
Table 1.4 shows that the feeds that have the highest contribution (Δ = highest- 
lowest = 0.816) followed by speed (Δ = highest-lowest = 0.717) and DOC 
(Δ = highest-lowest = 0.508). 
1.5.1 Analysis of Variance 
From ANOVA Table 1.5, it is found that the feed is the most important factor 
that affects surface irregularity. The environment, rake angle, and nose 
radius are found to have little effect. The best possible combination is: 
DOC (0.2 mm), cutting environment (wet), speed (110.84 m/min.), feed 
(0.1 mm/rev.), rake angle (+6 degree), and nose radius (0.8 mm). It is obvious 
from ANOVA that the DOC, speed, and feed affect significantly the mean 
value as fit as the variant of the Ra. The percent contributions of DOC, speed, 
and feed rate are 10.584%, 21.595%, and 29.110%, respectively. From the 
ANOVA outcome, it is understood that DOC, speed, and feed have an im-
portant effect on Ra and nose radius, tool rake angle, and surroundings have 
1: Initially produce N particle at arbitrary.
2: Estimate of most excellent fitness, worst fitness, Gravitational constant,
   mass, acceleration and force using Equations 9-14
3: Locate the most excellent solution that has been achieved by the particle
4: Revise the velocity and location as given by Equation 21 and 22
5: If the stop situation is realised than, stop.
   Otherwise, go to Step 3.

no consequence at a 95% confidence level. The DOC is found to be the least 
important parameter and feed rate as the most significant factor. The feed 
rate is the for the most part important factor that affects surface irregularity. 
1.5.2 Multiple Regression Prediction Model 
A multiple regression equation is modeled to find a relationship between 
process parameters and Ra for several combination of factor stage in a 
particular range. So, a second-order model is used for regression analysis in 
Equation (1.22).

Table 1.6. On the support of outcome, it can be seen that the highest and 
lowest fault percentage for Ra is 9.742% and −5.263%, which is suitable to 
a great extent. It has been found that approximate surface irregularity (Ra) 
is well within the limits. Hence, this model is used for optimization using 
GSA, PSO, and hybrid PSOGSA. 
1.6 OPTIMIZATION 
For optimization, a program is written in MATLAB. The achievement of 
the optimization method depends upon the choice of the parameters. A 
number of experiments are done to tune these parameters. Thirty runs are 
performed and the best result among the 30 is chosen as an ending solution. 
The parameter set for these three algorithms are given.

Parameters used for application of GSA are 
Population size = 100 
Maximum iterations (T) = 500 
α = 20 
Initial value of G0 = 100 that decreases to 1 according to Equation (1.8).

The initial value of G0 = 100 decreases to 1 with time. The optimum parameter 
for minimum surface roughness is shown in Table 1.7. Figure 1.6(a–c) shows 
the surface roughness (Ra) versus number of iterations for GSA, PSO, and 
PSOGSA. All three techniques gave about the same results. But the number of 
iterations required by PSOGSA is less, followed by PSO and GSA. 
1.7 CONFIRMATION OF RESULTS 
The reason of the verification test in this research is to confirm the most 
favorable cutting situation (x1 at level 2, x2 at level 3, x3 at level 2, x4 at 
level 2, x5 at level 2, and x6 at level 1) that is recommended with the trial. 
At best possible values, significant parameters are set at an optimum and 
the insignificant factors are set at an economic level. The confirmation re-
sults are compared by the predictable average. The predictable mean at the

x3 (L2), x4 (L2). and x6 (L1) are the mean values of surface irregularity 
with parameters at the best possible levels. From response Table 1.4, 
x3 (L2), = 1.976, x4 (L2) = 2.006, and x6 (L1) = 1.947. Hence, 
Ra = 
1.385 µm, Ve = 0.1717 (Table 1.5). 
A confidence internal (CI) for the predicted mean on a verification run is 
± 0.624 using Equation (1.24) i.e. CICE = ± 0.624. 
The 95% CI of the predicted best surface roughness is: [µRa − CI] < µRa< 
[µRa + CI] i.e. is 0.761 < µRa (microns) < 2.009. 
Table 1.8 shows the parameters at the selected levels for optimization of 
surface roughness. The optimum average value of Ra = 1.650 µm was obtained 
under the earlier mentioned cutting conditions on the lathe machine. Table 1.9 
shows the confirmatory experimental results. The mean of the responses is 
established to be within the confidence interval. Table 1.3 shows the results 
are very closely related to the minimum average surface roughness (Ra) of 
1.570 μm and individual quality characteristics of 1.38 μm in trial number 17. 
Table 1.7 shows that the three techniques (GSA, PSO, and PSOGSA) gave near 
about same results. 
1.8 CONCLUSIONS 
In this research, the PSO, GSA, and PSOGSA are used to optimize the 
process parameters in the machining of unidirectional-GFRP composite.

Study of SR for Turning of UD‐GFRP Composite 19 

Surface roughness (Ra) is observed as an output quality characteristic. The 
experiments are conducted as per (L18) orthogonal array. The following 
conclusions are made: 
1. The ANOVA of surface roughness (Ra) model shows that the pre-
dictive model is accurate and credible. The ANOVA outcome shows 
that x6 (DOC), x4 (speed), and x3 (feed) have important effects on 
surface irregularity. x5, x2, and x1 have no consequence at 95% CL. 
The feed rate is found to be a very important factor while DOC is the 
least important factor. The feed rate is responsible for the roughness 
produced on the unidirectional-GFRP workpiece.  
2. The percent contributions of DOC (10.584%), speed (21.595%), and 
feed (29.110%) are large, as compared to the other factors.  
3. Multiple regression coefficients R2 value is found be: 95.8%. R2 value 
for the developed model using regression modeling is extremely suf-
ficient as their R2 value is very close to 1.  
4. The optimization method used in this work can be used to find the 
necessary conditions to achieve the best quality under the given con-
straint. In this study, GSA, PSO, and PSOGSA are utilized to optimize 
machining parameters for a single objective in the machining of 
UD-GFRP. The experimental results show that PSOGSA has the ad-
vantage in convergence speed.  
5. The minimum surface roughness obtained by PSOGSA is 1.374 μm at a 
feed (0.0866 mm/rev), DOC (0.20 mm), and speed (78.2958 m/min).  
6. The analysis of results shows that minimum surface roughness can be 
attained by using a parametric value obtained by the PSOGSA algorithm.

2.1 INTRODUCTION 
There is ongoing research on composite materials, utilising the advantages 
of high-speed machining. However, the quantity of research with high- 
speed drilling is less compared with the research on conventional low-speed 
drilling. The next paragraphs present a brief review on research on drilling 
composite materials with conventional low-speed drilling, followed by 
high-speed drilling. 
Compared to conventional engineering materials utilised in the auto-
mobile, defence, and aviation manufacturing sectors, designers prefer com-
posite materials because they are lightweight, stiff, and robust. [1]. Drilling 
and other machining operations are used for structural connecting. Drilling 
activities, particularly high-speed drilling, are problematic with these mate-
rials due to their great heterogeneity and low heat conductivity. Defects such 
as fibre pull out, delamination, matrix cracking, and debonding are prevalent 
[2–5]. The majority of studies in the literature concentrated on thrust force as 
well as its impact on drilling flaws, particularly delamination. Complete de-
tails on delamination, as well as methods for measuring and assessing it, can 
be found elsewhere [6–8]. Khashaba et al., for example, looked at the effect of 
machining settings during GFRPC drilling both theoretically and empirically, 
focusing on thrust force and delamination [9,10]. The effect of production 
procedures on the mechanical characteristics of GFRPC composites was in-
vestigated by Formisano et al. [11]. Erturk et al. [12] investigated the effect 
of drilling circumstances such as feed rate, spindle speed, and drill bit shape 
on GFRP composite temperature and delamination. Non-traditional strate-
gies for reducing delamination during machining for GFRP composites were 
also discussed in the literature [13]. All of these tests were carried out using 
traditional low-speed drilling techniques. 
There has been little research of high-speed drilling fibre-reinforced 
composite laminates, which allows for a faster material removal rate, ac-
cording to the authors. Delamination is reduced and drilling costs are re-
duced with high-speed drilling. Researchers looked into the impact of high- 
speed drilling of delamination in a variety of methods. Kao and colleagues 
[14] studied micro-drill coatings and discovered that they increase hole 
quality. Lin et al. [15] investigated the effect of thrust force and torque on 
hole quality and determined that when spindle speed increases, cutting force 
drops, and delamination decreases. Rubio et al. [16] found that high-speed 
drilling resulted in better hole quality. Sanjay et al. [17] provided machin-
ability maps of high-speed composites drilling, showing the effect of feed 
and spindle rotating speed on delamination, circularity error, hole size, and 
surface roughness. They concluded that such a machinability map may be 
utilised to determine the impact of machining force fluctuations on tool 
wear. The drilling settings were optimised by Vijayan Krishnaraj et al. [18], 
who found that feed had a significant effect on thrust and, thus, on dela-
mination damage. The effect of feeds and spindle rotational speeds on 
24 Evolutionary Optimization of Material Removal Processes 

delamination during high-speed machining has previously been observed 
elsewhere [19,20]. Although recent research on high-speed machining in a 
metal matrix [21] as well as CFRP composites [22] has concentrated on 
drilling delamination, the major goal of this study was to see how spindle 
rotating speed, as well as feed, affected delamination, torque, thrust force, 
and hole diameter when drilling GFRPC laminates. 
This chapter presents an innovative methodology of combining grey re-
lational analysis (GRA) with fuzzy logics, and also presently proposed 
entropy-based weight integrated multi-variate loss function for optimisa-
tion of drilling variables during high-speed machining of composite mate-
rials. Results obtained from both the methods are compared for the 
applicability of these innovative approaches. 
2.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
As indicated in Figure 2.1(a), drilling experiments were performed on 
a Vertical Machining Unit MAKINO S33 with a power of 11 KW and a 
spindle speed of up to 20,000 rpm. To make drilling testing easier, a 
composite laminate was put on a dynamometer to measure torque and 
thrust force, which was then arrested to the machine’s bed, as shown in 
Figure 2.1(b). Drill bits utilised were two-flute coated carbide (K20) drill 
bits with a diameter of 5 mm. This study’s GFRP sheet was comprised of 
woven fibres reinforced in an epoxy matrix. The composite was 250 × 35 × 
3 mm3 in size and 1.9 g/cm3 in density. Two machining conditions were 
used in the experiment: feed and spindle rotation. There are five levels to 
each control factor. To ensure dependability, each experiment is done 
twice. The response is the average of these tests. The feeds were 500, 1,000, 
3,000, 6,000, and 9,000 mm/min, while the spindle rotational speeds were 
10,000–18,000 rpm (in the steps of 2,000). Experiments were carried out 
using the orthogonal array L-25, as shown in Table 2.1. A dynamometer

High‐speed Drilling of Composite Laminate 25 

(Syscon SI-223D) was used to measure thrust forces during milling. During 
drilling, a digital storage recorder was utilised to measure and store the 
forces. Delamination was assessed via scanning the holed sheet using a flat- 
bed scanner at a resolution of 1,200 PPI, and then saving the bitmap image. 
The photos were then transferred to the software ’Image J’ for additional 
processing. After that, colour photographs were transformed to binary. The 
delaminated area’s histogram was compared to the undamaged area’s 
histogram to determine the threshold for this change. Figure 2.2 shows the 
image processing approach used to obtain a delaminated area of acceptable 
quality. Delamination was determined using an adjusted delamination 
factor. Equations for the delaminations were previously published [6]. The 
hole diameter was measured using a coordinate measuring machine. The 
output values were analysed and optimised using Minitab 20 and MATLAB 
R2021a.

2.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
Experimental responses i.e., thrust force, torque, delamination both push- 
out and peel-up, and hole diameter at different machining conditions are 
shown in Table 2.2. 
Table 2.2 shows that as spindle rotation increases, delamination values 
increase as well. Krishnaraj et al. [18] found a similar pattern in their 
findings. The reason being that the increased heat generated during drilling 
with extremely high spindle revolutions soothes the composite matrix. This 
weakens the laminate and causes to the emergence of delamination at sig-
nificantly lower cutting forces. It’s also worth noting that the value of exit 
delamination is higher for smaller feeds, such as 500 mm/min. Because of 
the limited heat transfer of the soft epoxy matrix, any heat created by high

spindle speeds is concentrated near the hole [20]. The machinability maps 
of Rawat and Attia [17] also confirm the same. Rawat and Attia’s ma-
chinability maps [17] also support this. These maps show that delamination 
is strong at very low feed rates, such as 20 mm/rev, with a high spindle 
rotation of 15,000 rpm; however, as feed rates increased to higher levels, 
such as 60 and 100 mm/rev, delamination values reduced. 
Table 2.2 also demonstrates that as the spindle speed increases, the thrust 
force values drop. This could be due to increased heat generation during 
drilling with greater spindle revolutions, which then soothes the matrix, as 
previously mentioned. Thrust force and torque, on the other hand, rise as 
the feed increases, as larger feeds necessitate greater forces as well as torque 
for drilling. 
Due to the obvious thermo-mechanical characteristics of the GFRP la-
minates at higher spindle speeds at lower feed values, hole sizes increased 
with the increase in spindle rotations and reduced with the rise in feeds, as 
shown in Table 2.2 [20]. 
To obtain optimum machining conditions for these multi-responses si-
multaneously two innovative approaches, combining grey relational ana-
lysis (GRA) with fuzzy logics and also presently proposed entropy-based 
weight integrated multi-Vvriate loss function are used for optimisation of 
drilling variables during high-speed machining of composite materials. 
2.4 OPTIMIZATION WITH ENTROPY WEIGHT-BASED GREY  
RELATIONAL ANALYSIS 
2.4.1 Grey Relational Analysis 
This problem of high-speed drilling during machining of GFRP laminate is 
optimised with GRA, grey relational analysis. GRA is one quantitative 
method for obtaining the inequality and equality between the input con-
ditions. Because each of the output responses has different ranges and units, 
it is required to normalize the values of the responses in the range between 
1 and 0. In multi-objective optimisation problems, it may be necessary to 
consider some responses as maximisation (higher the better), some re-
sponses as minimisation (smaller the better), and some may be as nominal 
value is better type. GRA converts multi-response problems in to a single 
response called the grey relational coefficient. 
Responses of maximisation are normalised by using Equation (2.1).

B. Torque.

E. Hole Diameter. 
2.4.3 Grey Relational Grade 
Grey relational grade is generally calculated as a mean of all grey relational 
coefficients of corresponding responses, as in Equation (2.8). This equation 
is applicable only when equal weight is assigned to all the responses.

For real-life problems like high-speed drilling, all the output responses are 
not equally important; hence, by giving different weights for the responses, 
Equation (2.8) can be altered as Equation (2.9).

Where Wk shows the normalised weight of response k; for the equal 
weights, Equations (2.8) and (2.9) are the same. 
In this work, an objective method, the entropy method [23–25], is applied 
for the calculation of the weights for the responses. The detailed procedure is 
presented below. 
2.4.4 Entropy Method 
This method was developed by Weaver and Shanon in 1947 and further 
refined by Zeleney in 1982 for calculating objective weights of individual 
responses. Entropy is basically an estimate of uncertainty in the data or in-
formation. It uses the theory of probability. Weights by the entropy method 
are determined by normalising data by using Equations (2.2) and (2.3) and 
the corresponding entropy values of each of the responses are calculated 
using Equation (2.10).

Calculated normalized, P, and Pij in Pij values for the responses are shown 
in Table 2.4. Now, using these values, entropy and weights are calculated 
for the responses using Equations (2.10) and (2.11), respectively, and the 
values obtained are presented in Table 2.5.

The calculated weights using Equation (2.11) obtained for the responses 
are thrust force, torque, peel-up/entry delamination factor, push-out/exit 
delamination factor, and hole diameter are 0.20, 0.15, 0.23, 0.22, and 0.20, 
respectively. The same values are considered in the calculation of grey re-
lational grade using Equation (2.9). Table 2.6 represents the obtained grey 
relational coefficients, grey relation grade, and the rank for all test runs. 
2.4.5 Optimisation with GREG 
Grey relational analysis with entropy-based weights, grey relational entropy 
grade, was determined. Experiment number 7 shows the maximum value of 
the GREG represents the optimum combination of input parameters. The 
GREG values varied from 0.5265 to 0.8234. The experimental values of all 
responses at optimised machining conditions are peel-up delamination 
factor 1.207, push-out delamination factor 1.061, thrust force 32 N, torque 
0.06 Nm, and hole diameter 5.03 mm.

weight have limitations and uncertainty because of the use of nominal-the- 
better, higher-the-better, and lower-the-better characteristics for optimisa-
tion of processes like high-speed drilling. But, these methods are very efficient 
and effective methods for conversion of multi-objective problems into single- 
objective problems. Hence, further refinement of optimisation problems by 
genetic algorithm is used. Now the problem is converted to a single-objective 
function called grey relational entropy fuzzy with genetic algorithms. 
Earlier optimisation studies in the literature give either the same weights 
for all the responses or use a subjected method like the SIMO method, which 
are inadequate/improper ways to optimise the process parameters. Hence, 
the entropy method, which is an objective method, is used along with GRA to 
calculate most scientific objective weights to transform a multi-objective 
problem to a single-objective named GREG. In this way, complex multi-

34 Evolutionary Optimization of Material Removal Processes 

objective optimisation problems can be solved with integration of grey re-
lational analysis, entropy method, and fuzzy logic. Nonetheless, in this 
conversion process, there is disregard of relationships with evaluating re-
sponses. This method now presents the enhanced optimisation using correct 
weights for each response. 
2.5.1 Grey Entropy Fuzzy Model 
It was explained before that GREG includes a entropy-based weighted sum 
for all five grey relational coefficients; hence, for maximising, the GREG 
problem can be optimised without the consideration of responses criteria. 
For this, the fuzzy model was applied for this desirability function called 
GREG, considering all input factors. In a fuzzy model, the first step is 
fuzzification output and input data, the next step is generation of fuzzy 
rues, and then finally, de-fuzzification of results or outcomes. 
The equivalent GEFG values are later derived using a fuzzy-logic toolbox 
of MATLAB (R2021a). The GREG values of torque, thrust force, peel-up, 
and push-out delamination factors and hole diameter are used as the inputs 
for fuzzy-logic system, the triangular membership functions used for the 
fuzzy modeling. Nine linguistic membership functions, as lowest (LT), very 
low (VL), medium low (ML), low (L), medium high (MH), high (H), 
medium higher (MHR), higher (HR), and highest (HT) are used for both 
input factors as well as output of the grey entropy fuzzy grade. These 
membership functions are presented in Figure 2.3. The obtained GEFG 
values are shown in Figure 2.4, as displayed in the fuzzy rule viewer. In this 
figure, 25 rows show the fuzzy rules used and the five columns represent 
GRC values of thrust force, torque, peel-up, and push-out delamination 
factors and hole diameter, and the last column gives the de-fuzzified GEFG 
values. These GEFG values captured for all 25 experiments are displayed in  
Table 2.7. It can be noted from this table that Experiment Number 7 
(spindle speed of 12,000 rpm, feed rate of 1,000 mm/min) has the highest 
GEFG value, indicating the optimum combination of input factors for high 
drilling performance.

2.6 OPTIMISATION USING ENTROPY-BASED WEIGHT  
INTEGRATED MULTI-VARIATE LOSS FUNCTION 
Artiles-Leon [26] was the first who proposed multi-variate loss function for 
quality evaluation of a product. In the majority of the instances, customer 
wants an ideal or targeted value for any particular quality characteristics of 
a product. Because of this, he presented a quality loss function for ideal 
value. Since loss function has no dimension, hence, loss values for various 
quality characteristics Y1, Y2, …, Yn, functions of attribute variables X’s 
may be summed up for the calculation of total loss value, which is given in 
Equation (2.12).

The above equations consider only nominal values for the determination 
of loss value. Hence, this is not applicable for other types of quality char-
acteristics, like larger is the best (L-Type) or smaller is the best (S-Type). For 
this consideration, it became necessary to modify the equation so that it can 
be applicable to all the industrial problems. Ma and Zhao [27] modified 
this function, which can be suitable for real-world problems. This improved 
multi-variate loss function could be used for selection of the best alternative 
in multi-criteria decision-making problems as well as parametric optimi-
zation of processes having multiple responses. 
For larger-the-better type characteristic Yi, 
YLi is the lowest acceptable value 
YUi is the highest value above which there will not be furthermore de-
velopment in the performance of the product. Hence, the loss function for 
L-type characteristics is given in Equation (2.13)

After the modification of Artiles-Leon’s function considering different types

equally important for the real-world problems, Weights for the individual 
responses can be given either by using a subjective method or an objective 
method. In the present study, an objective method and entropy method are 
used for the calculation of weightages. Detailed calculations of weights by 
this method are already presented in earlier sections; the same weights are 
used here also. 
The steps followed are:  
1. Determining quality features such as nominal or intended value is 
best, greater is best, and smaller is best (L-, N-, and S-type). 
2. Determination upper specified limit, lower specified limit, and tar-
geted value.  
3. Calculation of individual loss value for each response considering the 
weightage for each response.  
4. Calculation of total loss by adding the individual loss values to obtain 
a single response.  
5. Determination optimum combination of machining parameters based 
on the minimum total loss value. 
The same experimental results as shown in Table 2.2 are chosen for the 
decision matrix. Weights, as calculated by an entropy method, as shown in 
Table 2.6, were used in the calculation of total loss value. 
As the thrust force and torque should be minimum to minimise the de-
fects during drilling, smaller the better type, Equation (2.14) and delami-
nation (peel-up and push-out) nominal value is one, and hole diameter 
target or nominal value is 5, nominal type Equation (2.12) and to calculate 
the total loss, Equation (2.15) is used. The upper and lower specified limits 
are chosen from the highest and lowest values of the corresponding quality 
characteristics and nominal or targeted values for delamination (peel-up 
and push-out) and hole diameter are chosen as 1 and 5, respectively. Table 
shows the chosen values of upper specified and lower specified and targeted 
values for the responses. Maximum and minimum values of the responses 
were used as upper specified and lower specified limits, respectively. Lower 
specified limit, upper specified limit, and nominal values chosen are shown 
in Table 2.8. Calculated individual loss and total loss value are represented 
in Table 2.8.

From Table 2.8, it can be observed that Experiment No. 7 has the lowest 
total loss value, 0.0417. Hence, the combination of spindle rotation of 
12,000 rpm and feed of 1,000 mm/min are the optimum values of ma-
chining conditions for optimum drilling performance. The same combina-
tion of machining conditions is obtained by using both grey entropy 
reasoning grade and grey entropy fuzzy grade methods. In order to compare 
the optimisation methods used in this study, the Spearman correlation 
coefficient is calculated. The calculated Spearman correlation coefficient 
between the two approaches used in this study is 0.81, which is greater than 
0.7, indicates there is strong positive correlation between the methods used 
for optimisation in this study Table 2.9.

2.7 CONCLUSIONS 
This chapter presents multi-response optimisation using two different ap-
proaches, entropy-based weight integrated grey relational analysis with fuzzy 
logics further refinement by using genetic algorithms and entropy-based 
weight integrated multi-variate loss function. Input parameters in this study 
are spindle speed and feed and responses are thrust force, torque, peel-up and 
push-out delamination factors, and hole diameter. Based on obtained results 
from both approaches the following conclusions are drawn:  
• As spindle rotational speed increases, delamination also increases and 
delamination is higher at the lower values of feeds. 
• For spindle rotational speed of 12,000 rpm, the minimum delami-
nation obtained at the feed rate 1 m/min but for higher speeds of 
16,000 and 20,000 rpm, the optimum feed value is 3 m/min for 
minimum delamination.  
• Torque and thrust force decrease with an increase in spindle speeds 
because of greater heat generation during drilling with high speeds 
and subsequent softening of the matrix of the composite.  
• Torque and thrust force both increase with the feed rate as higher feed 
rates need grater forces and torque required for drilling.  
• Hole diameter increases with an increase in spindle rotational speed 
and decreases with an increase in feed values because thermo- 
mechanical behaviour of composite material at higher spindle rota-
tional speeds with lower feeds.  
• Experiment Number 7 shows the maximum value of GREG value, 
0.8234, is the optimum combination of input parameters (spindle 
rotational speed of 12,000 rpm and feed of 1,000 mm/min) for multi- 
response optimisation.  
• Optimisation results of entropy-based weight integrated multi-variate 
loss function shows the total loss value is low i.e., 0.0417 for 
Experiment Number 7, indicating the optimum combination of ma-
chining conditions.  
• Both optimisation approaches gave the same machining conditions for 
multi-response optimisation.  
• Spearman correlation coefficient calculated is 0.81 and that indicates 
there is a strong positive correlation between the approaches used for 
optimisation.

3.1 INTRODUCTION 
AISI H13 alloyed steel has been widely used to manufacture several in-
dustrial parts such as forming tools, dies, extrusion dies, mandrels, etc. This 
wide range of applications has been feasible owing to the sustainable 
toughness and hardness of AISI H13 under elevated working temperatures. 
In most applications AISI H13 is in the range of 45 to 65 HRC (Kumar and 
Chauhan, 2015). A significant body of contributions has been devoted for 
DOI: 10.1201/9781003258421-4

the examination of cutting force components as well as surface roughness 
indicators, not only for AISI H13 grade but for other engineering materials 
and superalloys as well (Boy et al., 2016; Hosseini et al., 2016; Patole and 
Kulkarni, 2017; Korkmaz et al., 2020; Vaxevanidis et al., 2020; Şahin and 
Esen, 2021; Arsene et al., 2021). 
AISI H13 and other special engineering alloys require proper selection of 
cutting tool materials, especially when it comes to finish turning. Noticeable 
contributions in the field have reported the usage of cubic boron nitride 
(CBN) tools and poly crystalline diamond (PCD) tools in the form of cutting 
inserts. Such materials are mandatory for maintaining surface finish and 
accuracy. The rationale behind their selection is the fact that ordinary cutting 
materials do not sustain their chemical stability during the machining pro-
cess; they exhibit rapid tool wear owing to high temperatures and strong 
adhesion (Elbestawi et al., 1997). Cutting tool selection should be based also 
to proper geometry according to the machining stage. It is widely known that 
hard-turning cutting inserts comprise 0.8 mm tool tip radius whilst those 
used for finish-turning have a smaller tool tip radius equal to 0.4 mm. Even 
though these conventional geometries have been widely applicable, they may 
restrict productivity or deteriorate quality owing to the restricted range for 
selecting feed rates. A cutting insert with a large tool tip radius will maintain 
surface quality, yet, it will lead to higher cutting forces and thus regenerative 
chatter. On the contrary, cutting inserts with smaller radii will reduce cutting 
force but they dramatically restrict the applicable range of feed rate selection 
for maintaining a good surface finish. To balance this trade-off between 
productivity and surface finish, wiper geometries for cutting inserts have been 
developed to provide an alternative to high surface finish (Abbas et al., 2020). 
Several research experiments have presented comparative results among 
conventional tool tip geometries and wiper geometries either by conducting 
actual machining operations (Abbas et al., 2020) or simulations using the 
finite element method (Ghani et al., 2008). 
Undoubtedly every manufacturing process is affected by its corresponding 
process parameters (Ghosh et al., 2018). To determine feasible – if not ad-
vantageous – settings for process parameters, handbooks, and cutting tool 
catalogues are available to practitioners to select specific values from a con-
strained applicable range. However, such recommended ranges for setting 
process parameters are away from being optimal to satisfy performance 
metrics. In addition, new developments and novel aspects concerning modern 
materials, such recommendations are yet to be provided. Based on this 
context, artificial intelligence and soft computing techniques are continuously 
implemented to provide advantageous solutions to almost any manufacturing 
process; conventional and non-conventional. Obviously, emphasis is given to 
intelligent algorithms and artificial neural networks that have been widely 
employed to optimize process-related parameters regarding one, or more 
than one optimization objectives. Outeiro (2014) examined residual stresses 
and surface roughness in AISI H13 dry turning under different hardness 
46 Evolutionary Optimization of Material Removal Processes 

states. Then, an approach involving a neural network and a genetic algorithm 
was used for optimizing cutting parameters. Pathak et al. (2015) optimized 
the turning parameters for AISI H13 by designing an L9 orthogonal array 
experiment and implementing a neural network. The model evaluated two 
objectives: the minimum surface roughness and the maximum material re-
moval rate. Mia et al. (2019) performed optimization for hard turning 
parameters by using the teaching–learning-based optimization and bacterial 
foraging algorithms. The weighted sum method was used to transform the 
diverse responses into a single response. 
From the review presented above, it is evident that the industrial focus in-
volves both the experimental observation to control the process-related 
parameters that affect discrete performance metrics and the optimization 
capabilities through the application of either existing or new intelligent algo-
rithms that follow genetic, evolutionary, and swarm-intelligence principles. 
Based on these concepts, this study has been attempted to implement a group of 
modern intelligent algorithms to optimize the parameter selection affecting 
two widely known machinability indicators, the main cutting force and surface 
roughness, for the CNC finish-turning of AISI H13 die steel using a wiper CBN 
cutting insert. Prior to this effort, experimental observations have been ex-
amined by implementing statistical techniques while regression equations 
have been generated to produce prediction models for main cutting force and 
surface roughness. The models have been used as objective functions for the 
selected algorithms and the results obtained have been rigorously compared to 
investigate their functionality and algorithmic evaluation modules. 
3.2 EXPERIMENTAL 
3.2.1 Design of Experiments 
In order to examine the influence of the independent process parameters n 
(rpm), f (mm/rev), and a (mm), on the responses of Fz (Nt) and Ra (μm) 
experiments CNC turning experiments were executed as per the experi-
mental design. The central composite design (CCD) involved 20 runs with 
reference to the number of cutting parameters and their corresponding le-
vels (Table 3.1).

CCD experimental design is an important approach in response surface 
methodology (RSM). It allows determining corner, axial, and center points 
of the design and therefore it can lead to more controllable solution do-
mains for fitting a second-order regression model. However CCD approach 
has the drawback of involving a relatively large number of experimental 
runs owing to the experimental replicates. As a result, the CCD method 
should better be selected when the number of independent variables is low 
(i.e. three parameters). In this work the three cutting parameters produce a 
reasonable number of experimental runs. By considering uniform precision 
for three-factor experimentation, 8 factorial points, 6 axial points, and 
6 center runs, a total of 20 runs were considered. 
3.2.2 Materials and Equipment 
The workpiece material was the commercial “ORVAR® SUPREME” tool 
steel of the known Swedish manufacturer Uddeholm®. The steel has been 
used in its soft-annealed condition (delivery condition 180 HB = 10 HRC) 
and in a hardened state with a hardness equal to 513–534 HB (53–54 
HRC). Two Ø30 x 300 mm pre-machined rods comprising ten discrete 
zones separated by 5 mm grooves were used for the main experiments for 
facilitating chip removal among the cuts (Figure 3.1). The CBN wiper 
cutting insert used was the SECO® TNGA332S-00820-L1-C, CBN200 with 
the PTJNR 2525M16 insert holder (Figure 3.2) whilst machining experi-
ments were conducted using a HAAS® TL-1 CNC turning center. The CNC 
turning center was equipped with a computer-aided interface (Labview® 
module) so as to obtain online measurements for the three cutting force 
components, Fx, Fy  and Fz (Nt). The three-component KISTLER® dy-
namometer was implemented for measuring Fz (Nt) (Figure 3.3). 
The trends for online measurements referring to the main cutting force Fz, 
obtained during the experiments were further examined to compute the 
average values from raw data. Therefore, the average value from the mean-
ingful regions (i.e. where high cutting force signals occurred), was calculated 
to establish the first response. Arithmetic surface roughness average Ra (μm)

was the second response and it was measured using a TESA® Rugorsurf® 10G 
portable roughness tester along with its respective software as per the ISO- 
4287 standard (Figure 3.3). Each cutting zone was measured three times by 
rotating the workpiece at an angle of 120º. As a final surface roughness 
output, the average value from the three measurements was computed. 
3.2.3 Experimental Results and Analysis 
The results obtained from the experiments are presented in Table 3.2. The 
term ANLD refers to the “annealed” state of AISI H13, whereas the “HRC” 
indication prompts to the hardened state of the material. The asterisk “*” 
denotes the corrected values in the response surface experiments. Analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) for the results was conducted to assess the effect of 
machining parameters and estimate the experimental error. ANOVA for the 
results of main cutting force – Fz and arithmetic surface roughness average – 
Ra for both states of the tool steel examined are given in Tables 3.3 and 3.4. 
MINITAB® R17 software was applied to statistically analyze the ex-
perimental data. The regression model selected was the full quadratic re-
sponse surface model, as Equation 3.1 represents.

In Equation 3.1, Y represents the response (i.e. Fz (Nt) and Ra (μm)) whilst xi 
is the ith parameter. A result less than 0.05 for the p-value suggests that the 
corresponding independent variable is significant. When it comes to lack of 
fit, p-value has to be greater than 0.05. Note that an insignificant lack of fit is 
preferred, which means that any term excluded by the model is insignificant 
and thus the model fits well. Anderson–Darling normality test is used to 
validate the generated models’ suitability referring to Fz (Nt) and Ra (μm) 
responses. In the Anderson–Darling test, if p is lower than the selected

significance level (c.i. = 0.05), the data fails to follow a normal distribution. In 
this study ANOVA results for the quadratic models generated, indicate that 
the models are suitable for predicting Fz (Nt) and Ra (μm). The coefficient of 
determination (R2) indicates the percentage of total variation in the response 
explained by the terms in the models. In this work, ANOVA indicates that all 
four quadratic models for the “ANLD” and “HRC” AISI H13 conditions are 
suitable for predicting Fz (Nt) and Ra (μm) with quite high contributions, 
i.e. 83.82% for both main cutting force plots; and 85.11% and 89.69% for 
surface roughness at the “annealed” and “hardened” conditions, respec-
tively. P-values for lack of fit are both far beyond 0.05 (p-value > 0.25 and 
> 0.123); see Figure 3.4. 
3.2.4 Statistical Analysis 
With reference to p-value, it has been concluded that in both cases of an-
nealed and hardened AISI H13 conditions, the main cutting force Fz (Nt) 
are mainly influenced by the linear terms followed by the square terms and 
interaction terms. On the contrary, when examining surface roughness Ra 
(μm) at the annealed state of AISI H13, the hierarchy of influence suggests 
first the linear terms, then the square terms, and finally the interaction 
terms, while at the hardened state square terms come first, followed by 
interaction effects and finally the linear effects. Individual significance of 
each term is calculated by a t-test at 95% confidence level; thus, terms

having p-value less than 0.05 are significant. The coefficient of determina-
tion (R2) indicates the percentage of total variation in the response ex-
plained by the terms in the models and has been found equal to 83.82% for 
main cutting force Fz (Nt) in both AISI H13 conditions and 85.11% and 
89.69% for surface roughness Ra (μm) in annealed and hardened AISI H13 
conditions, respectively. 
Contour plots are an alternative depiction of three-dimensional surfaces 
on a two-dimensional illustration. They involve two predictors-variables on 
X and Y axes whilst the response variable appeared in Z axis as a contour. 
Corresponding contour plots for the responses of main cutting force and 
surface roughness were generated to show how their values change as 
functions of different pairs of independent variables. Figure 3.5 shows the 
resulting changes in main cutting force and surface roughness when altering 
the influential process parameters regarding the response under examina-
tion, i.e., feed rate and depth of cut for cutting force and feed rate and 
spindle speed for surface roughness (i.e. Fc = f(f, a) and Ra = f(n, f)). It is 
evident that feed rate f (mm/rev) and depth of cut a (mm) have the largest 
effect on the response of main cutting force Fz (Nt) referring to both ma-
terial conditions. Main cutting force is maintained to low levels if moderate 
feeds are to be applied in combination to low-to-moderate depths of cut. 
The main cutting force reaches its highest value for the highest levels for 
feed rate and depth of cut as expected. In general surface roughness is 
maintained at low-to-moderate spindle speeds, with low-to-moderate feeds, 
while higher values for a spindle may be used only in combination to low 
feeds to avoid excessive tool wear, mainly referring to the hardened state. 
3.3 MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION USING MODERN 
META-HEURISTICS 
For both conditions of the AISI H13 die steel two bi-objective optimization 
problems have been formulated and solved in this section, using three 
modern meta-heuristics, namely multi-objective greywolf algorithm, MOGWO 
(Mirjalili et al., 2016), multi-verse optimization algorithm MOMVO, (Mirjalili 
et al., 2017), and multi-objective antlion algorithm, MOALO (Mirjalili 
et al., 2017). Main cutting force Fz and surface roughness Ra, are the two 
optimization objectives with respect to the three cutting conditions of 
spindle speed n (rpm), feed rate f (mm/rev), and depth of cut a (mm). The 
solution domain has been created by adhering to the same parameter low- 
high levels whilst each candidate solution is a vector corresponding to 
the values of three machining parameters within their predefined ranges. 
The two problems have been solved using the recommended settings for 
algorithm-specific parameters, with reference 20 individuals and 1,000 
generations as the major algorithmic settings for running the simulations in 
MATLAB® 2014b. For all three algorithms, 50 non-dominated solutions

of the AISI H13 annealed state, while the majority of points are in the 
region where both objectives are satisfied. In the hardened case of AISI 
H13, the results appear to be more complex with the impression that 
MOALO has managed to outperform the non-dominated solutions of 
MOGWO and MOMVO. However, its spread is narrower than those 
corresponding to MOGWO and MOMVO referring to the X-axis assigned 
to Fz. These solutions clearly add to cutting force but ease surface rough-
ness to different percentages. It is the job of the end user to decide which of 
these solutions should be implemented regarding the production needs and 
priorities in terms of machining objectives. 
3.4 CONCLUSIONS 
This work has studied the effect of cutting parameters spindle speed n, feed 
rate f, and depth of cut a on main cutting force Fz, and surface roughness Ra. 
The research refers to two conditions of the AISI H13 die steel; soft-annealed 
(10 HRC) and hardened (53–54 HRC). Experimental results were obtained 
through the utilization of response surface methodology by establishing a 
central composite design. The statistical analysis and interpretation of the 
respective results was carried out by performing analysis of variance and 
regression modeling. Normal probability and contour plots were exploited to 
study the effects of parameters on the responses. The experimental outputs 
were further used for building regressions models that served as objective 
functions for optimizing the objectives of cutting force and surface roughness 
using three modern intelligent algorithms namely MOGWO, MOMVO, and 
MOALO. The findings of the study are summarized as follows:  
• When finish-turning the AISI H13 die steel at its hardened condition, 
main cutting force is approximately 30% larger the one corre-
sponding to the soft-annealed state. Yet, surface roughness is reduced 
providing superior surface finish.  
• According to the analysis of variance, the hierarchy of effects of 
cutting parameters in terms of cutting force suggests the linear terms, 
the square terms and finally the interaction terms regardless of the 
AISI H13 condition. However, when it comes to surface roughness, 
this hierarchy changes to linear, followed by square, followed by in-
teraction terms for annealed state, and square, followed by interac-
tion, followed by linear terms for the hardened state.  
• Depth of cut and feed rate are influential cutting parameters for main 
cutting force, whilst spindle speed and feed rate are influential cutting 
parameters for surface roughness, regardless of the material condition. 
Surface roughness alters its experimental trend from one condition 
to another with quite high complexity; thus, suggesting a difficulty in 
correlating the independent machining parameters to surface roughness. 
Dry CNC Turning of AISI H13 Die‐Steel 57 

• There is no clear superiority in multi-objective intelligent algorithms 
when implemented to machining optimization problems. Therefore, 
algorithms should be tested by conducting several evaluations and 
examining their statistical outputs to gain a clear understanding for 
their performance. However, final selections for the settings of ad-
vantageous machining parameters to facilitate all objective under 
question, should be based on the requirements corresponding to 
production and shop floor’s prerequisites, since no unique solution 
can be deemed superior to other when it comes to multi-objective 
optimization.

4.1 INTRODUCTION 
In this research work, MRR and surface irregularity of the manufactured 
goods obtained through the turning process are calculated experimentally 
and the outcome obtained is interpreted systematically. The most important 
industries utilising composites are wind energy, aerospace, shipping, and 
building (Kazmierski, 2012). Composite material is prepared of two or 
more dissimilar materials and gives out properties that are not attainable 
through several particular material components. In this heterogeneous 
material, one material is the matrix and the material with a small amount is 
the reinforcement. 
The difficulties encountered during machining of composite materials are 
matrix burning, pattern of fine particles like chips, and rapid tool wear (Wang 
and Zhang, 2003 & Davim, 2009). Considering these shortcomings, the 
conventional machining process still finds a wider acceptance for machining 
composite material. Various variables such as the workpiece material, the

wounding tool material, the inflexibility of the machine and the position, and 
management have to be considered. 
Presented are various studies on the machining of GFRPs. The machining 
of GFRP composites is disparate as of conservative materials and it ne-
cessitates strange consideration on wear resistance of the tool. To find 
surface irregularity and dimensional property requires an optimization 
technique to locate the best achievable cutting parameters (Palanikumar, 
2008). Eyup Bagci and Birhan Isik (2006) investigate the process of ma-
chining of UD-GFRP composites. The maximum test errors in predicting 
surface roughness were 6.30% and 6.36% from the ANN model and RSM, 
respectively. Isik (2008) obtained the results of the machining of UD-GFRP 
and the most favorable cutting parameters were recommended to acquire a 
desired surface quality. Isik (2009) used weighting techniques for the rotary 
of UD-GFRP composites with a cemented carbide instrument. Meenu 
Gupta and Surinder Kumar (2015) studied the optimization of surface ir-
regularity and MRR in rotating a UD-GFRP rod through a PCD cutting 
tool with the principal component analysis technique. It was established 
that feed is a superfluous major factor, followed by DOC and speed. 
Parida et al. (2014) investigated the compressive properties of epoxy resin 
when combined with graphite and powder clay under different conditions. 
The effect of cutting speed during machining of GFRP was studied.  
Khandey et al. (2017) used GA combined with GRA based on PCA for the 
machining of aluminum-based MMC with 25% SiC particulates using a 
turning process. Surinder Kumar et al. (2019) presented a fuzzy logic op-
timization technique to optimize the turning of a UD-GFRP workpiece by 
using a PCD cutting tool. The DOC was established as the most essential 
factor. (Yang, 2012) compared the performance of genetic algorithm, PSO, 
and flower pollination applied to different optimization problems. It was 
found that the flower algorithm (FA) is more powerful than GA and PSO. 
Moshat et al. (2010) utilized a PCA-based Taguchi method to optimize 
surface irregularity and MRR in a CNC vertical milling where machining 
aluminum plates is done utilizing CVD-coated carbide tools. The milling 
parameters were feed, DOC, and speed. It was found that the proposed 
method is capable of solving multi-faceted difficulty. Anantha kumar et al. 
(2013) optimized surface irregularity, MRR, and tool wear in the turning of 
1040 medium carbon steel using a PCA. From the experimentation results, 
DOC and feed showed more superior control than speed on the combined 
effect. Mohanty et al. (2019) applied weighted a PCA combined with the 
Taguchi process during EDM of D2 steel with copper, brass, and DMLS 
electrodes. A tool electrode was obtained as the important factor through 
the ANOVA. Chintan Kayastha et al. (2013) used PCA shared with 
Taguchi’s approach to forecast the surface irregularity and MRR in a 
copper workpiece. The variables such as feed, speed, DOC, and tool po-
sition were calculated for least surface irregularity and greatest MRR. The 
correlation between MRR and Ra was 0.251. Mishra et al. (2017) reduced 
62 Evolutionary Optimization of Material Removal Processes 

the dimensionality of big record sets by using a PCA based on a vector space 
transform. The parametric algorithm first transformed the data to the ap-
propriately centered polar coordinates and then computed the PCA. 
In the last few years, several heuristic evolutionary optimization algo-
rithms have been developed. Several techniques to resolve optimization is-
sues found in the literature are artificial immune system (Farmer et al., 
1986), ant colony (Dorigo et al., 2006), simulated annealing (Suman and 
Kumar, 2006), gravitational search algorithm (Esmat Rashedi et al., 2009), 
genetic algorithm (Tang et al., 1996), gray wolf algorithm (Mirjalili et al., 
2014), bee algorithms (Pham et al., 2006), glow worm swarm (Krishnanand 
and Ghose, 2005), and cuckoo search (Gandomi et al., 2013). These al-
gorithms have been useful to a big range of applications. 
In this manuscript, steps are taken to optimize the parameters, such as 
DOC, feed, environment, speed, rake angle, and nose radius in orthogonal 
cutting of a UD-GFRP composite for the two responses (MRR and surface 
roughness) with WPCA. In the WPCA technique, every component was 
considered to thoroughly explain the variant in every response. The WPCA 
technique was used to explain the variant as the weight to join every 
principal component in order to create MPI (Das et al., 2013). The L18 
orthogonal array trial plan is used in the current revision. ANOVA is 
performed to find the involvement of every parameter on the performance 
attributes. These methodologies helped to gain excellent feasible tool geo-
metry and cutting situations for the turning of UD-GFRP with a carbide 
(k10) cutting tool. Confirmatory analysis is conducted to validate the op-
timum process parameters. 
4.2 EXPERIMENTAL STUDY 
Experiments are carrying out on a NH22–lathe arrangement with a cooled, 
wet and dry cutting situation. Figure 4.1 shows the lathe setup. 
4.2.1 Work Material, Cutting Tool, and Cutting Conditions 
A workpiece material (GFRP rod) was used, consisting of UD fibers that are 
pulled throughout a resin bathtub into the form of a rod. The benefit of 
GFRP comprises (Harvey and Ansell Martin, 2000) easy handling, light 
weight, well-suited with resin and timber, well-suited material properties, 
advanced resistance to rotting, and convenient in an acidic atmosphere. 
Pultrusion processed unidirectional GFRP composite rods are used. The 
material has E-glass as 75±5% g, epoxy resin (weight 25±5%), density as 
1.95–2.1gm/cc, water absorption 0.07%, tensile strength 6,500 kgf/cm2, 
compression strength 6,000 kgf/cm2, weight of rod is 2.300 kg, length of 
840 mm, and diameter as 42 mm. A carbide tool (K10) is used in the ex-
perimentation. The rake angles of the carbide tool taken into consideration 
Study in Turning of Composites with WPCA 63 

are: +6°, 0°, and −6°. Two tool nose radii of 4 mm and 8 mm are taken into 
consideration for the study. The properties of a carbide (K10) tool used are 
as follows: density, 14.95 g/cm3; clearance angle, 7º; hardness, 1,600 
Vickers kg/mm2; thermal conductivity, 95 W/mK; and front clearance, 10º. 
Taguchi’s mix level plan is selected. The most convenient orthogonal array 
(OA) is L18 orthogonal array with 17 degrees of freedom. The designed 
variables at various levels are planned in Table 4.1. 
4.2.2 Response Variables 
Surface roughness and MRR are response variables that are used in the study. 
The Ra of the machined surface is evaluated with a Surf-com 130A type in-
strument with a transverse length of 4 mm, least count 0.01 μm, and cut-off 
length 0.8 mm. The outcome of the experiment for 18 test conditions with 
three repetitions is reported in Table 4.4. The chosen quality feature, surface

The measured experimental values for MRR and Ra are shown in Table 4.2. 
4.3 WEIGHTED PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS 
Su and Tong (1997) and Antony (2000) put forward a PCA to work out a 
multi-response problem. A PCA eliminates correlation between the re-
sponse and finds out an uncorrelated value index called principal compo-
nents (Datta, Nandi, Bandyo padhyay and Pal, 2009). It is basically a 
dimension reduction technique where uncorrelated features (i.e. principal 
component) are generated from the correlated features. To reduce the di-
mensionality, the principal component with less variance is ignored so that 
the dimensionality reduces from n→k, where k˂n. In this investigation, a 
weighted principal component is used to resolve a multi-optimization 
problem. The explained variation is used as the weight to take into con-
sideration all principal components. In industry, multi-response optimiza-
tion is considered a quality characteristic.

4.4 ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF EXPERIMENTAL 
RESULTS 
Table 4.2 shows the parametric position and the raw data such as surface 
irregularity and MRR in which all experiments are conducted. Surface irre-
gularity and metal removal rate records were analyzed to find out the influ-
ence of various parameters (Kumar et al., 2013). For Ra, (SB) criterion is 
used, whereas (HB) criterion is chosen for MRR, as given by Equations (4.1) 
and (4.2), respectively. The standard deviations for Ra and MRR are 0.5930 
and 92.9546, respectively. The normalized value are shown in Table 4.3. 
Then the single-value decomposition is performed that gives significant sin-
gular values, eigen values, and eigen vectors, as shown in Table 4.4. Eigen 
values are obtained using a square of singular values. Table 4.5 gives the

maximized. Table 4.6 shows the normalized values of weighted MPI. 
Table 4.7 shows the response table for MPI, which show that feed has 
the maximum effect (Δ = 0.3049) followed by DOC (Δ = 0.2975) and speed 
(Δ = 0.2161). The optimal parameters are set at G2 (tool nose radius at 0.8 mm),

H3 (tool rake angle at +6 degrees), I1 (feed at 0.05 mm/rev), J1 (speed at 
55.42 m/min), K2 (cutting condition is wet cooling) and L1 (DOC at 0.2 mm). 
The main effect of the different parameters when they are altered from 
the lower to higher levels can be visualized from Figure 4.4, which shows 
the response graph of the multiple performance index (MPI) for G, H, I, J, 
K, and L. It is clear from Figure 4.4 that the multiple performance index 
(MPI) is highest at G2, H3, I1, J1, K2, and L1. The results of ANOVA for 
the MPI are recorded in Table 4.8. From the ANOVA result, it is obtained 
that I, J, and L have major effects on quality loss. G, H, and K have no 
effect at a 95% confidence level. It shows that the three parameters of feed, 
speed, and DOC are established as the main factors for the chosen multiple 
performance characteristics, for the reason that their related P ratio is less 
than 0.05. It can be perceived from Table 4.8 that feed (I) is the most im-
portant machining parameter for affecting the multi-response due to its 
maximum percentage involvement (34.220%). The percentage error in-
volvement is 23.73%, as shown in Table 4.8. The R-Sq value of 91.61% 
and R-Sq (adj) value of 76.24% show the efficiency of carrying out an 
experiment. The reasons for the result of the nearby study are explained as 
follows: The cutting environments (wet and cool) were very effective in

cooling the job and tool. Figure 4.5 shows the residual plots for WPCA 
(MPI). The data is normal, as it lies close to the straight line n in the normal 
plot and other plots also show that there is no unusual structure. 
4.5 CONFIRMATION EXPERIMENT 
Just the once the most select stage of the process parameters is chosen, the 
last step is to calculate and confirm the performance characteristics 
with the supreme stage of the parameters. (Kumar et al., 2013) found 
I2, J2, and L1 as the optimum parameters while minimizing the surface 
irregularity. µRa was 1.385 µm. The predicted confidence interval at a 
95% confidence level (CICE) is 0.761 < µRa (microns) < 2.009. (Kumar 
et al., 2013) found I3, J3, and L3 are the optimum parameters while 
maximizing the metal removal rate and µMRR was 289.99 mm3/sec. The 
predicted confidence interval at a 95% confidence level was (CICE) is 
242.811 < µMRR (mm3/sec.) < 337.169. 
Optimal design for the weighted multi-response performance index (MPI) 
value is established based on the expected average by considering a large 
amount of significant factors at their best levels. Speed, DOC, and feed are the 
three most important factors at the first levels, as shown in Table 4.8. In 
the WPCA-based Taguchi’s technique, the optimal position is found to be 
G2H3I1J1K2L1. The predicted optimal setting becomes G2H3I1J1K2L1, as 
observed from Figure 4.4. The predictable mean at the optimum setting can 
be obtained from Equation (4.4). After assessing the optimal parameter set-
tings, the optimal conditions are confirmed by conducting a confirmatory 
test. A confidence interval (CI) for the predicted mean on a verification run is 
calculated with Equation (4.5) (Ross, 1988):

TMPI = overall mean of multi-response performance index = 0.6749 
(Table 4.6). 
I1, J1, and L1 are the mean values of the weighted multi-response per-
formance index (MPI) with parameters at the most favorable levels. From 
Figure 4.4, I1 = 0.7831, J1 = 0.7508, and L1 = 0.8478. Hence, µMPI = 1.0319 
and Ve = error variance =0.01319 (Table 4.8). 
A CI for the predicted mean on a verification run is ± 0.2093 with 
Equation (4.5) i.e. CICE = ±0.2093. 
The 95% CI of the predicted optimal weighted multi-response performance 
index (MPI) is: [µMPI − CI] < µMPI< [µMPI + CI] i.e. 0.822 < µMPI < 1.241. 
Table 4.9 shows the optimistic testing outcome. Superior conformity 
between the predicted machining performance and actual machining 
performance is shown. The mean values of the responses from these ex-
periments are found to be within the confidence interval. The outcome 
has been confirmed during a confirmatory test, shown as a suitable out-
come in Table 4.9. 
4.6 CONCLUSIONS 
This work is focused on efficient rotary of UD-GFRP with a carbide tool 
with an optimization of multiple responses. From the study, the following 
outcomes can be concluded:  
1. WPCA combines individual principal components into a single multi- 
response performance index (MPI) to be used for optimization.  
2. From ANOVA, the important cutting parameters that affect the 
surface irregularity and MRR are found to be feed rate followed by 
DOC and speed.  
3. Multi-response optimization with the MPI is performed for rotary 
unidirectional-GFRP and the excellent setting of feed at 0.05 mm/rev, 
speed at 55.42 m/min, and DOC at 0.2 mm are found.  
4. Feed is the important machining parameter that affects the multi- 
response with percentage involvement of 34.220%.

5.1 INTRODUCTION 
Composites are synthetically created multiphase material having an attractive 
mixture of the most excellent property of the constituent phases. Usually, the 
matrix is continuous and surrounds the other phase. Fiber glass composite 
in which glass fibers are contained within polymer matrix in continuous or

discontinuous manner. Various common fiber glass composite applications 
are: automotive and aquatic bodies, plastic pipes, storage vessels and in-
dustrialized floorings. A multitude of latest applications are being used or at 
present investigated by the automotive industry. Machining of composite 
materials is a challenging task because of matrix burning, rapid tool wear, 
fiber pull-out, fiber fuzzing, and formation of powder like chips. Wang and 
Zhang [1] and Davim [2] found that the machining of fiber-reinforced 
polymer composite is distinct from metals due to the way the matrix material 
behaves and varying properties of fiber, and orientation of fiber that results in 
high tool wear, irregular surface finish on finished product and imperfect sub- 
surface layer with cacks. Machining of GFRP composites is a critical op-
eration because of incidence of fiber delamination, resin pull-out etc. Davim 
[3] and Davim and Pedro [4]. Many methods for machining composite ma-
terials are put forward. These include conventional and non-conventional 
processes such as ultrasonic machining, laser cutting, and EDM. However, 
their disadvantages involve a heat affected zone and lower rate of production. 
Considering these drawbacks, conventional machining process still finds a 
larger acceptance for machining composite materials. 
5.2 LITERATURE REVIEW 
Srinivasan et al. [5] established the statistical form for realizing the tool wear 
and important variables for the machining of GFRP composite by the ANOVA. 
Prasanth et al. [6] considered the machinability of UD-GFRP by utilizing 
brazed carbide tipped end mill tool. Taguchi L25OA was utilized for trial 
proposes and ANOVA was utilized to recognize the involvement of variables 
on performance characteristics. Isik et al. [7] used weighting technique for 
turning of UD-GFRP composites with cemented carbide insert. Meenu et al. [8] 
used Taguchi’s technique to perform experiments using polycrystalline dia-
mond cutting insert for the machining of UD-GFRP composites and ANN was 
used. Kumar Surinder et al. [9] presented a fuzzy logic optimization technique 
to make high grey relation grade during the turning of UD-GFRP workpiece by 
using a PCD cutting tool. The most prominent factor was depth of cut. 
Sehgal Anuj Kumar [10] presented RSM and ANN technique to improve the 
CNC end milling of FPD Iron Grade 80-55-06 to improve the surface 
roughness. The least value of surface roughness was 1.28 μm. The ANN model 
resulted in improved accuracy in comparison with RSM. Dautenhahn [11] 
proposed the use of PSO for optimization problems as it is well planned and 
practical. Yildiz [12] addressed hybrid robust differential evolution (HRDE) 
algorithm to multi-pass turning operation. From the investigation of results, it 
was found that the HRDE is more powerful compared to other approaches. 
Yang et al. [13] explored flower pollination algorithm to solve two bi-objective 
benchmark problems. Mohamed and Ibrahim [14] utilized the flower polli-
nation algorithm shared with chaos theory to deal with ratios optimization

problems. Jabri et al. [15] addressed hybrid genetic simulated annealing al-
gorithm (HSAGA) to multiple passes of turning. It was observed that the 
planned HSAGA is more powerful than other metaheuristic algorithms. 
Over the previous few decades, researchers have developed a lot of 
techniques and methods to resolve optimization issues. Yang et al. [16] such 
as genetic algorithms (GAs) Holland, [17], honeybee colony’s Karaboga 
[18], particle swarm optimization (PSO) [19], bee algorithms (BAs) Pham 
et al. [20], monkey search Mucherino and Seref [21], glow worm swarm 
Krishnanand Ghose [22], bacterial foraging Passino [23], fish-swarm al-
gorithm XL et al. [24], cuckoo search algorithm (CS) Gandomi, et al. [25], 
bat-inspired algorithm (BA) Yang [26]. These algorithms have been fa-
vourably employed to large-scale optimization problems. Yang [27] com-
pared its achievement with GA; PSO for distinct optimization problems and 
found that the FPA is stronger than GA and PSO. Jerome and Natas [28] 
bring forward flower algorithm to solve combinatorial optimization pro-
blems. Acherjee et al. [29] utilized RSM and FPA for laser welding of dis-
similar plastics. The algorithm was proficient in predicting the correct trend 
of the parametric effects. Alyasseri et al. [30] modified, hybridized, and 
tuned parameters of flower pollination to confront the complicated opti-
mization problems. The author summarized that the flower pollination 
algorithm is an influential and beneficial tool for solving distinct optimi-
zation problems in a wide variety of applications. 
The literature survey revealed that the machining of UD-GFRP is rela-
tively a less invested area. In this paper, target is on the examination of 
optimum process parameters for the E-glass UD-GFRP composite with FPA 
method. In this manuscript, to optimize the parameters, viz. DOC, en-
vironment, speed, nose radius, feed and rake angle in orthogonal cutting of 
UD-GFRP composites for the surface roughness with FPA. Mathematical 
model is built using simply important parameters. A regression analysis is 
useful to perceive the most excellent level of cutting parameters and their 
importance. Unimportant parameters are not of concern. For optimization 
of parameters in turning, flower pollination algorithm (FPA) uses model as 
an objective function. 
5.3 EXPERIMENTAL CONCEPT 
5.3.1 Fabrication of UD-GFRP Rod and Specification 
The workpiece material (GFRP rod) used consisted of UD fibers that were 
pulled throughout a resin bathtub into the form of the rod. The benefit of 
GFRP comprises [Harvey, Ansell Martin, 31] easy handling, lightweight, 
well-suited with resin and timber, well-suited material properties, advanced 
resistance to rotting, convenient in an acidic atmosphere, and abetter re-
sponse due to improved resin bonding. Pultrusion processed unidirectional 
GFRP composite rods are used. E-glass and epoxy are the fiber and resins,

respectively. The details of the specification of this substance are: weight of 
rod 2.300 kg, length 840 mm, diameter 42 mm, reinforcement unidirec-
tional (E’ glass roving), density 1.95–2.1 gm/cc, water absorption 0.07%, 
tensile strength 6,500 kgf/cm2, compression strength 6,000 kgf/cm2, 
thermal conductivity 0.30 kcal/h∙m²∙°C, glass content 75±5%, and epoxy 
resin content 25±5%. 
5.3.2 Turning Process 
The rotary operation is carried out using a carbide tool (K10). Figure 5.1 shows 
the NH22 lathe machine where the machining is performed. Measurements 
are made three times at each setting to record the Ra value. The rod is cut down 
to smaller pieces for machining. The specimens are turned at speed between 
420 rpm to 1,210 rpm. The details of the carbide (K10) inserts are as shown in  
Table 5.1. A Tokyo seimitsu instrument is used to measure surface irregularity. 
The setup is displayed in Figure 5.2.

5.4 METHODOLOGY 
In this study, perfectly designed experiments by the Taguchi method are 
used to accumulate data. For modeling, regression methodology is used. 
The mathematical model is optimized using a flower pollination algorithm 
(FPA) method to attain the best machining situation for the necessary 
surface roughness. 
5.4.1 Design of Experiments 
The Taguchi methodology is a powerful technique to optimize output quality 
characteristics controlled by multiple process parameters Ross [32]. It assists 
in obtaining a combination of experiments to build experimental design easily 
and is well organized. Linear graphs are used to assign parameters to columns. 
The plan consisted of 18 tests allocated to columns 1 to 6, respectively, as 
shown in Table 5.2. During this study, the smaller the superior principle, it is 
well thought out to make the best use of the surface roughness. The signal-to- 
noise ratio for the response is computed [Rose, Roy, 33 and 34] as:

In statistics, regression studies include a lot of techniques for modeling and 
analyzing a number of parameters when the main concentration is on the 
connection between the explained variable and explanatory variables

surface irregularity. The first-order model gave low predictability i.e. high

prediction error for measured responses. So, the second-order model is used 
for regression analysis. 
5.4.3 Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) 
Yang [27] developed the flower pollination algorithm (FPA), whose main 
objective was reproduction via pollination. Self- or cross-pollination are the 
two methods used for pollination. Cross-pollination also takes place at a far 
distance via pollinators such as bats, birds, and bees that fly a far distance 
and thus can be designated as the universal pollination [Pavlyukevich, 36]. 
Moreover, flower loyalty can be used as an addition stage using the parallel 
or dissimilarity of two flowers. It is considered that every plant has only 
single flower that only creates a single pollen gamete. The solution xd
0 re-
presents a flower in the d dimension space. 
FPA has been found to be useful for economic weight dispatch problems 
and multi-objective optimization problems. FPA is a flexible, scalable, 
straightforward optimization process. Therefore, FPA reveals good quality 
results to solve a variety of real-life optimization efforts from dissimilar 
domains such as electrical and control systems, global function optimiza-
tion, automatic engineering optimization, and many others Yang [27]. 
Characteristics of the pollination process and subsequent policies were 
considered for flower constancy and pollinator behavior:  
1. Biotic and cross-pollination are thought of as a global pollination 
method with pollen-carrying pollinators carrying out Levy flights.  
2. Local pollination involves abiotic and self-pollination. 
3. Reproduction chance is seen as flower constancy, which is in pro-
portion to the similarity of the two flowers taken into consideration.  
4. The switch possibility controls both the local and global pollination 
p [0, 1]. Local pollination can have a fraction p that is considerable 
in the complete process of the pollination on account of physical 
closeness and wind speeds. 
The above rules are changed into proper updating equations. For straight-
forwardness, it is supposed that every plant has a single flower that produces 
one pollen gamet. This makes sure the pollination and reproduction of 
the fittest solution is improved according to Rule 1 and Rule 3, as given by 
Equation (5.2):

5.6 RESULTS AND CONVERSATION 
The research trial was carried out to appraise the influence of feed, speed, 
nose radius, rake angle, and DOC, along with environment on the surface 
irregularity of the GFRP rods. Table 5.4 reveals the investigational result 
86 Evolutionary Optimization of Material Removal Processes 

for surface irregularity that depends on the experimental parameter 
combinations for the 18-test condition. The least average surface irre-
gularity of 1.570 µm is attained in experiment 17 at a nose radius of 
0.8 mm, rake angle of positive 6°, feed of 0.1 mm/rev, speed of 55.42 m/min, 
cooled environment, and DOC of 0.2 mm. In general, a mixture of the largest 
level of nose radius and rake angle, moderate feed, lowest speed, and DOC 
and cooled environment gave rise to a better surface finish. The response 
table is represented in Table 5.5. Table 5.5 depicts the contribution of feed 
rate is highest e (Δ = 0.816) followed by cutting speed (Δ = 0.717) and DOC 
(Δ = 0.508). 
5.6.1 Analysis of Variance 
From Table 5.6 it is established that feed is the prime important parameter 
that affects surface irregularity. The insignificant parameters are rake angle, 
environment, and nose radius. Based on the response in Table 5.5, the 
selected conditions are: (1) nose radius (0.8 mm) at L2, (2) rake angle 
(+6 degree) at L3, (3) feed (0.1 mm/rev.) at L2, (4) speed (110.84 m/min.) at 
L2, (5) environment (wet) at level 2, and DOC (0.2 mm) at level 1. This 
analysis is executed for a level of importance of 5%. Table 5.6 reveals that 
the percent involvement of feed (29.110%) is enormous compared to speed 
(21.595%) and DOC (10.584%) in affecting the surface irregularity at a 
95% assurance level. 
5.6.2 Multiple Regression Prediction Model 
A multiple regression equation is modeled for a parameter in order to 
calculate surface roughness for several combinations of factor levels in a 
particular range. So, a second-order model is used for regression analysis 
Equation (5.5).

Kumar Surinder et al. [37] Ra and different predictors are taken as log 
values. The multiple regression coefficients R2 of the second-order model 
are evaluated as 95.8% and relative inaccuracy involving predicted and 
exact values is furnished. The average absolute error percentage of 2.285 is 
achieved. In accordance with results, it is apparent that the highest and 
lowest inaccuracy percentage for surface irregularity is 9.742% and 
−5.263%, which is adequate. It became clear that relative inaccuracy of 
surface irregularity is well within reasonable bounds. Hence, this model is 
utilized for optimization using the flower pollination algorithm (FPA). 
5.6.3 Optimization (FPA) 
For optimization, a program is written in MATLAB. The achievement of 
the optimization method depends upon the arrangement of the parameters.

Study of SR in Turning of E‐Glass with FPA 89 

A number of experiments are accomplished to tune these parameters. The 
switch probability parameter p is taken as 0.8. The population size chosen 
is 20. The maximum iterations are 1,000. The flower pollination algorithm 
is employed that mimics the impressive feature of the flower pollination. 
Flower constancy and levy distance pollination are the causes of escaping 
from local optima that produced the effectiveness of the algorithm. Flower 
constancy i.e. choosing same species of the flower frequently resulted in 
easy convergence of algorithm. Table 5.7 shows the best possible para-
meters for least surface irregularity and Figure 5.4 shows the surface 
roughness verses number of iterations for FPA. The flower pollination al-
gorithm (FPA) technique came out with nearly the same results. 
5.7 CONFIRMATION OF RESULTS 
The reason of the verification test in this manuscript is to confirm the 
optimum cutting situation (x1 at L2, x2 at L3, x3 at L2, x4 at L2, x5 at

From the response in Table 5.5, surface roughness value was found at the most 
favorable setting of x3 at level 2, x4 at level 2, and x6 at level 1 is 1.385 µm. 
The predicted confidence interval at a 95% confidence level is (CICE) is

best possible settings to verify the results. The parameter and their parti-
cular levels when particular response occupied into concern are shown in  
Table 5.8. Three verification experiments are performed at the best possible 
position of the machining parameters suggested by the analysis. Table 5.9 
shows the confirmatory experimental results. The optimum average value 
of Ra = 1.650 µm is attained. Table 5.4 shows that the results are strictly

related to the minimum average surface roughness (1.570 μm) and in-
dividual quality characteristics optimization is 1.38 μm in trial number 17. 
The flower pollination algorithm (FPA) technique gave about the same 
results as shown in Table 5.7. 
Kumar Surinder et al. [38] the investigation is passed out to confirm the 
previously developed observed statement for surface irregularity. The two 
data values are closely correlated to each other signifying the validation of 
developed regression equation. The average absolute percentage error of 2.101 
is achieved for the surface roughness model. It turns out that the highest and 
lowest error percentage for surface irregularity is 8.092% and −5.444%, re-
spectively, which is very gratifying. Hence, the result predicted from the de-
veloped model is a moderately accurate graphical relationship of real and 
predicted values of surface irregularity and shown in Figure 5.5. 
5.8 CONCLUSIONS 
In this research, the FPA is used to improve the course parameters in the 
machining of E-glass UD-GFRP composites. Surface roughness is observed 
as an output quality characteristic. The experimentation is performed using 
a L18 orthogonal array. The following summary is drawn from the present 
analysis:  
1. In this study, single response optimization based on FPA is utilized to 
optimize machining variables during the machining of E-glass UD- 
GFRP. The experimental results indicate thatFPA is remarkably ef-
fective and has a high convergence speed and precision.  
2. The ANOVA of surface roughness model shows that the predictive 
model is correct and believable. The main cutting parameters af-
fecting the surface roughness are found as a feed rate followed by 
cutting speed. Feed is the most important factor, whilst DOC is the 
least important factor. The percent contribution of feed rate 
(29.110%) is large compared to cutting speed (21.595%) and DOC 
(10.584%) at a 95% assurance level).

3. Multiple regression coefficients R2 value is found as 95.8%, which is 
very close to 1 so the developed model is highly adequate.  
4. At the optimum setting of x3(L2), x4(L2), and x6(L1), the surface 
roughness obtained is 1.385 µm.  
5. 2.101 is the average absolute percentage error obtained.  
6. 1.3744 μm is the surface roughness obtained at a feed (0.0866 mm/

6.1 INTRODUCTION 
The idea of removing material from a work item with an edged cutting tool 
has been around for a long time. As a result, the cutting tool is moved in

relation to a work piece. The material removal method is linked to plastic 
deformation and the creation of chips as a result. Traditionally, the cutting 
tool is tougher than the work material. In most circumstances, the use of such 
equipment and machining methods is sufficient. Science and technology are 
constantly evolving a novel alloys and materials with higher hardness, 
weight, and strengthwhich are hard to manufacture to achievea required 
precision and accuracy [1–7]. Many recent advances in aerospace and nuclear 
engineering are also related to the increasing use of diverse materials such 
as nitralloy, hastalloy, nimonics, waspalloy, stainless steel, carbides, metal- 
matrix composites, heat-resistant steels, monolithic and composite 
ceramics, high-performance polymers, aluminides, and so on. There is a 
significant demand for these materials’ well-finished products with high 
precision and complicated intricate patterns that impact the machining 
process and its economics [8–10]. However, there are some hard and brittle 
work materials for which typical cutting procedures for material removal 
are insufficient. Conventional procedures, for example, make it extremely 
difficult to produce small holes of elaborate designs on thin brittle jobs 
[11–13]. Because of their low flexibility, the piercing, stamping, and ex-
trusion processes do not perform well on brittle materials. These materials 
may fracture or crumble as a result of such procedures [14–16]. Drilling 
circular holes in brittle materials is also challenging if ordinary drills are 
used. For such scenarios, techniques like laser beam machining (LBM), 
electro-discharge machining (EDM), ultrasonic machining (USM), electron 
beam machining (EBM), and abrasive jet machining (AJM) are re-
commended [17,18]. These are known as unusual machining methods. 
They are unusual machining techniques because conventional tools are 
not used for metal cutting, there is no shear stress at the tool-workpiece 
contact, and some type of energy is directly utilised. Over the last 50 years, 
more than twenty, non-traditional production approaches have been suc-
cessfully developed and used in production engineering. Table 6.1 depicts 
the different Non Traditional Machining (NTM) procedures [19] based on 
the kind of energy required for cutting. 
Table 6.2 compares the process economy and their respective efficiencies, 
and it is obvious that AJM requires very little capital expenditure, less 
electricity, and is more efficient [20]. As a result, in this study, abrasive jet 
machining was chosen to process the most often used engineering materials. 
AJM is an unconventional machining technique. The mechanical energy of 
compressed air and abrasive material is utilised in these operations to achieve 
material removal or machining. It is a material removal technology that 
makes use of high-speed jet of air/gas and an abrasive aggregate to remove the 
substance. An abrasive is a tiny, hard, irregularly shaped particle. The high- 
velocity jet is directed at the surface by the controllers. This machining 
method is based on the abrasive erosion theory. When high-velocity abrasive 
particles impact a hard or brittle workpiece, some metal is removed from a 
striking surface. This material removal method is triggered due to brittle

fracture of the material (glass) as well as micro-cutting by abrasive particles. 
This is the basic procedure for abrasive jet machining [21–26]. 
AJM has been the subjected to influence of jet velocity carrier gas, abrasive 
size and type, stand-off distance, nozzle shape/material, and wear on total 
machining materials using statistical methods and numerical models with 
appropriate testing methodologies. 
Lima et al. [27] performed AWJ studies on agate surface finish to depict 
the effect of process factors like abrasive mass flow rate and traverse speed 
on agate surface quality. The trials were carried out with four different 
abrasive mass flow rates and three distinct traverse speeds in two different 
thicknesses of agate plates, and it was discovered that the surface polish 
varied depending to the depth from the abrasive jet’s entrance surface. 
Hutyrova et al. [28] demonstrated the efficacy of AJM and water jet ap-
plications of disintegrating spinning wood plastic composites (WPCs). The 
pressures of scientific factors (size of abrasive particles and traverse speed of 
cutting head) on exterior topography were studied by optical profilometry 
methods, and it were revealed that using the technology may successfully 
tackle the situation of traditional turning causing the polymer matrix 
melting and subsequent cutting tool adhering. Bhowmik et al. [29] created 
the RSM methodologyfor optimising AWJM process parameters on green 
composites. Confirmation tests were used to assess the model’s validity and 
appropriateness. The suggested design may be utilised to create a metho-
dological process for optimizing the process parameters in environmentally 
friendly production operations. Carach et al. [30] investigated the influence 
of AWJ traversal speed upon surface value as a micro-structure generated 
upon manufactured surface utilisingAustralian garnet as abrasive. A laser 
confocal microscope was utilisedfor inspection and characterisation the 
surfaces, and the experimental results demonstrated that coarse manu-
facture of complicated substances can be achieved by appropriate tool by 
abrasive water jet turning technology. Vasanth et al. [31] worked to

understand have an impact on of operational parameters like superficial 
velocity, machining duration, and grain length on steel elimination rate, 
floor texture transformation, and floor polish in a swirling abrasive flui-
dized mattress machining process, a completely unique variant of Fluidized 
Bed Machining (FBM). Surface change changed into proven to be faster 
with SA-FBM than with conventional FBM, and quality abrasive grains 
produced a advanced floor finish. 
In several industrial applications of glass fiber-reinforced plastic, Ibraheem 
et al. [32] employed abrasive water jet cutting technology to produce bolt 
holes in the construction of structural frames (GFRP). The effects of AWJM 
parameters upon hole forming process of woven-laminated GFRP materials 
were scientifically addressed to examine the consequences of the expected 
independent variables on the dependent variables to decide the ideal benefits 
of handling boundaries. The effect of dilute polymer solutions upon the 
roughness, width, and shape of micro-channels machined with abrasive 
slurry-jet micro-machining (ASJM) machinery were explored by Kowsari 
[33]. Even a modest quantity of a higher-molecular-weighted polymer was 
shown to drastically reduce the width of machined microchannels for a given 
jet diameter. T. Burzynski and M. Papini [34] used a ray tracing approach to 
account for particle size effects, mask erosive wear, feature evolution at any 
impact angle with second strike, curvature smoothing, and mask edge effects 
using the narrow band level set methodology (NB-LSM) based model. The 
second-strike model has been adapted to any impact angle, and it has been 
validated using earlier observations on covered micro-channels into glass-
ware with ratios (AR) > 1. Same was also tested alongside earlier LSM models 
and computational methods. In AJM applications, Dehnadfar et al. [35] 
employed the shadow graphic approach to examine particle velocity and size 
distributions in a free jet and via a mask aperture for both angular and 
spherical abrasives. The influence of the mask powder form, opening size, 
and size upon following distribution of particle velocity and mass flux via a 
mask aperture was empirically proved using the shadow graphical approach. 
The observed mass flow patterns matched a previously published analytical 
model quite well, demonstrating its validity. The models were directly ex-
perimentally validated, allowing them to be employed in surface development 
models and to forecast a changing shape of features in microAJM. 
Li et al. [36] presented and discussed a radial-mode AJM to comprehend 
the material removal mechanisms and process, and consequence of pro-
cessing variables (abrasive mass flow rate, rotational surface speed, speed, 
feed, nozzle tilt angle and water pressure) on material removal rate, surface 
roughness and depth of cut. Whilst comparing to standard offset-mode 
turning, the cutting mode was more favourable for high MRR. A dimen-
sional analysis was performed and validated and found to agree well with 
the experimental data, within a standard deviation of 0.2%. Fan [37] uti-
lized molecule picture velocimetry to lead test research on molecule speeds

linear downstream expansion. Within range investigated, and the rate of 
increase likewise increased with nozzle diameter. Then, mathematical 
models for molecule speeds in an air jet were created, and the findings were 
demonstrated to match well with actual data in terms of both magnitude 
and variation trend H. Getu et al. [38] investigated the cryogenic and 
ambient temperature embedding of aluminium oxide particles in acryloni-
trile butadiene styrene, polytetrafluoroethylene, poly dimethyl siloxane, and 
poly methyl methacrylate. The percentage area covered by inserted Al2O3 
particles under cryogenic settings was found to be much lower than that of 
regular abrasive jet micromachining (AJM). The surface area sheltered by 
embedded particles was shown to decrease as embedded particle coverage 
increased. As a result, it was suggested that glass bead blasting at 45°C and 
freezing approach significantly decreased particle embedding following 
AJM. Various particle removal procedures were tested, and it was dis-
covered that using cryogenic AJM reduced particle embedding. 
Domiaty et al. [39] used the AJM to drill glass sheets of a range of 
thickness for assessing the machinability under different regulating para-
meters. They proposed a mathematical model and compared the results 
to those of other models reported before. Fast Regime-Fluidized Bed 
Machining (FR-FBM) was developed by Barletta et al. [40]. By altering the 
FR-FBM conditions, the roughness was increased by 3 to 4 times. Getu 
et al. [41] compared the electro-osmotic detection flow limit and separation 
efficiency of AJM machined-glass channels to standard wet etching with 
hydrofluoric acid–machined glass channels. The electro-osmotic mobility of 
AJM channels was found to be similar to that of wet-etched channels, and 
the detection limits of the two types of chips were almost identical. Surface 
roughness was studied in micro channels to see how it affected separation 
efficiency and electro-osmotic mobility. Experiment data on the impact of 
AJM process variables on surface roughness was also provided and ana-
lysed in order to create approaches for improving AJM surface quality. In 
work did by Barletta et al. [42] fly tension impacts both completing power 
following up on the grating and rough contact on a superficial level, it was 
resolved that the finished surface is profoundly dependent on it. This re-
search also developed methods for assessing the smoothness of the inner 
surface of Inconel 718 tubes and enhancing their form correctness. Barletta 
et al. [43] developed the FB-AJM hybrid technique and conducted extensive 
interior polishing trials on circular tubes. With the use of a fluidized bed, a 
hybrid arrangement was created to stabilise the unpredictability of 
the abrasive flow. First, the effect of major operative factors on process was 
investigated using a systematic method based on design of experiments. 
Following that, the machining components were contemplated as far as 
waviness profile development and unpleasantness to progress machining 
productivity, consistency, and repeatability. 
Some of the researchers employed AJM numerical analysis and modelling 
to assess the impact of jet velocity, carrier gas, stand-off distance, abrasive

size and type, nozzle material, nozzle shape, and wear upon overall ma-
chining. By representing nozzle stand- off length and diverging angle of 
every molecule, In the review completed by Nauhi et al. [44], the disparity 
was created by the normal conelike dissimilarity in the stream, as well as 
changes in disintegration instigated by optional effects of bouncing back 
particles, as indicated by computational liquid elements estimations. The 
model expectations were very near the noticed surface examples machined 
in level glass and PMMA targets. Using a statistical method, Zohourkari 
et al. [45] evaluated the influence of important machine parameters upon 
the MRR in abrasive water jet turning (AWJT). The intensity of reduce and 
reducing head traverse velocity had been proven to be the maximum es-
sential factors, while rotation velocity become marginal. 
Kim et al. [46] created a process planning approach that generated a 3D 
machining route for a 3Dworkpiece and mask automatically. The appli-
cation examples were also examined twice. Kim et al. [47] suggested an 
automated modelling approach for the 3D nonplanar mask construction 
based on observed geometry in micro-abrasive jet machining. To validate 
the algorithm, application software was created and tested using verifica-
tion and actual situations. Selvan and Raju [48] cut stainless steel with 
AWJ. Experimental tests were directed to select the processing parameters, 
using regression analysis, foster an experimental model for foreseeing cut 
depth in abrasive water jet cutting of stainless steel, by differing grating 
stream rate, navigate speed, water strain and standoff distance. Using CFD 
and theoretical analysis, Mostofa et al. [49] enhanced component mixing in 
AWJ machining by blending air, water, and abrasives with in a mixing 
chamber. Disintegration in the spout body was more noteworthy in the 
main zone and expanded with spout length, as indicated by this informa-
tion. Li et al. [50] laid out molecule speed models in view of molecule mean 
width, spout length, air thickness, wind current speed and molecule 
thickness in the wake of concentrating on molecule speeds in a miniature 
grating air fly hypothetically. By isolating the stream and the spout in air 
into discrete sections along the fly pivotal bearing, a mathematical answer 
for the models was created to register molecule speeds. The model calcu-
lations and corresponding experimental data were found to be in good 
agreement, with average errors of less than 4%. 
Burzynski and M Papini [51] made the model of cover erosive wear in 
AJM that permitted them to estimate the surface improvement of both the 
objective and the veil by characterizing them as a ceaseless and half and half 
veil target surface. When wearing a mask, the glass target profiles were 
larger and deeper, as well as the PMMA target profiles became broader. 
The objective surface’s advancement was determined by partitioning it into 
a framework of cubic cells, every one of which was appointed a harm 
boundary relying upon the quantity of particles that slammed into it. For a 
typical micro-abrasive blasting setup, the predicted eroded profiles from the 
simulation were compared to the empirically observed profiles, and there 
Study of MRR in Abrasive Jet Machining 103 

was excellent agreement at lower and higher particle flux [52]. S. Wan and 
G.C. Lim [53] developed the fine-beam cutting system by analysing the 
transient flow in abrasive suspension jet cutting machines after pump 
cutoff. The study was driven by a need to better comprehend the issue of 
nozzle and line clogging, which is exacerbated by use of smaller nozzles and 
increased operating pressures the in fine-beam systems. The form of the 
abrasive jet machined surface was examined by Balasubramaniam et al. 
[54]. The form of the surface created in AJM was determined using a semi- 
empirical equation. The effects of particle size, standoff distance, centre 
line, and peripheral velocities of the jet on the generated surface were also 
investigated. Verma and Lal [55] endorse a theoretical evaluation making 
use of a two-segment go with the drift machine to decide the abrasive 
particle pace in an air-abrasive jet. Numerical results were compared to 
experimental data and a model was developed to estimate the material 
removal rate in AJM (drilling) using semi-empirical fracture mechanics and 
a quasi-static indentation technique. The following gaps in abrasive jet 
machining were discovered after a thorough review of the available litera-
ture: the bulk of published research has concentrated on a certain compo-
sition of work material rather than examining numerous types of workpiece 
materials. Inside the fluidized bed-chamber, the uniform and homogenous 
mixing of abrasives with the carrier gas impinges on the whole workpiece 
surface over its cutting zone, which has never been documented in the lit-
erature previously. 
6.2 EXPERIMENTATION 
6.2.1 Development of Experimental Set-Up 
Experimental set up were developed using the following components: 
6.2.1.1 Frame 
The machine’s structure and frame are made of mild steel. The mild steel 
angle components were obtained and then arc welded together in the 
workshop to make the stand and frame. The experimental set up is depicted 
in Figure 6.1. 
6.2.1.2 Nozzle and Mixing Chamber 
The spray gun’s nozzle is a component. Stainless steel is used to construct it. 
It was chosen because it works well with our abrasives (roasted sand, fine 
sand, and lime+sand). The abrasive is stored in a chamber linked to the 
pistol. Figure 6.2 Nozzle and Mixing Chamber.

6.2.1.3 FRL Unit 
An FRL device is mounted on the machine’s left side to filter and control the 
air. It strains the compressed air, trapping solid particles (dust, filth, rust) 
and separating liquids (water, oil). Figure 6.3 shows FRL Unit. 
6.2.1.4 Funnel 
A funnel is connected underneath the workpiece to collect the used abra-
sives and cut particles. It has a draining effect. Figure 6.4 shows Funnel. 
6.2.1.5 Assembly for Movement of Nozzle 
The spray cannon is mounted on hollow rods of material to create an as-
sembly. This permits the cannon to move in a straight line, horizontally, 
and vertically. 
Figure 6.3 FRL unit.    
106 Evolutionary Optimization of Material Removal Processes 

6.2.1.6 Mounting for Workpiece 
The mountings are used to appropriately position the workpiece and limit 
the workpiece’s movement during experiments. 
6.2.1.7 Outer Cover 
To ensure operator safety, the mechanism is covered with a clear cover to 
prevent abrasive particles from flying out with force and injuring the operator.  
Figure 6.5 shows the assembly of the final developed experimental set up 
6.2.2 Methodology for Experimentation 
Soda-lime glass popular for soda–lime–silica glass, was chosen as a work-
piece to test the effects of the various abrasives. The most popular variety of 
glass is soda-lime glass, which is used for glass containers and windowpanes 
for various other items. Borosilicate glass is commonly used in bakeware. 
Approximately 90% of all produced glass is soda–lime glass. 
The standoff distance was kept constant throughout the experiments in 
order to achieve optimal accuracy. The three types of abrasive materials 
utilized for drilling were roasted sand, coarse sand, and lime + roasted sand. 
Experiments were carried out by altering the compressed air pressure in 
relation to the time necessary for drilling. 
6.2.2.1 Design and Parameters 
This procedure involves a large number of factors, all of which have a direct 
or indirect impact on the machining outcomes. For this purpose, present

investigation only major and easy to control variables such as type of sand and 
pressure are considered in the experimentation. The other variables such as 
SOD are considered as 1 cm and kept constant during machining as shown 
in Tables 6.3 and 6.4. Taguchi parameter layout became utilised to attain

excessive performance in experimental records making plans and processing. 
Taguchi’s Signal-to-Noise (S/N) ratio became used as a statistical overall 
performance measure. The S/N ratio relies upon at the exceptional traits of the 
product/manner to be optimized. The S/N ratios is used for: - Larger-the Better, 
Smaller-the-better and Nominal-is-best. The parameter combination with the 
greatest S/N ratio is the best setting. One of the most important elements in 
Taguchi’s approach is the choice of an orthogonal array. Orthogonal arrays 
are a series of all the possibilities used to determine the least number of tests. It 
helps to determine the optimal level of each process setting and determine 
the relative relevance of each process parameter. The orthogonal array L9 was 
selected for the experimentation. To obtain the optimum parameters combi-
nation, Taguchi’s standard S /N ratios were selected (Ross, 1996) and equation 
as follows.

6.3 RESULTS & DISCUSSION 
6.3.1 Neural Network Methodology 
An artificial neural network (ANN) is designed to receive three levels of 
input from two elements. The elements with network diagram of the cre-
ated ANN are illustrated in Figure 6.7, with the factors, kind of sand and 
pressure in bar are normalised on the probability scale. In a feed forward 
neural network, the multilayer perceptron (MLP) is chosen above con-
volution (CNN) and radial basis functional neural network (RNN). MLP is 
the simplest network, consisting of a number of simple neuron-like pro-
cessing units structured in layers, with each layer’s units connected to all the 
layers before it. The layers are joined by nodes, which form a “network” of 
interconnected nodes as a neural network. The network uses functions like 
trainlm, trainbr, trainbfg, trainrp, logsig, and trainscg to map the type of 
sand and pressure to the output time. These functions are used to calculate 
the weight (w) and bias (b). After several attempts, the size of hidden layers 
is set to 10. When the functions in the network achieve the minimal gra-
dient, the training results are terminated. Table 6.5 depicts the training 
progress using random data division, the Levenberg-Marquardt function, 
and performance measurement in terms of mean squared error. Although 
the epoch target was set at 1000, it was reduced to 4 due to a lack of data in 
a short period of time. The initial mean squared error started at 0.389 and

ended to 5.32 × 10−18 till the convergence of the solution. The gradient as a 
derivative of small step function of a slope at the start was 0.707 and ended 
with 7.45 × 10−10. 
The momentum control parameter (mu) for the function at start was 0.001 
and ended with 1 × 10−7 to control the error convergence. The least MSE 
(5.32 × 10−18) in the validation step is happened at epoch 4 which has the best 
validation performance equal to 0.0393 as shown in Figure 6.8. The model 
training keeps going as long as the error of the network on the validation 
vector is reducing. The analysis stop point is at 4 epochs which is without any 
error repetitions as the best validation performance matches (4 epochs) with 
the stop point. The journey of gradient, mu and validation checks are shown 
in Figure 6.9. It is observed that the gradient was small at the start and in-
creased in later epochs. However, the mu dropped linearly over the iterations. 
The validations checks were constant till the final epoch shows that the 
best validation performance (without error repetition) cannot occur before 
4 epochs. The error distribution as shown in Figure 6.10 shows at seven 
instances during training the error were centralized with a value of 0.005461 
which is almost equal to the zero error. The instances of testing and valida-
tion error were only once and on the left and right side of the training error. 
The training data in Figure 6.10 shows the full correlation coefficients 
(R values = 1). The correlation coefficient time = target value − 1.3 × 10−9 as 
the best relation between the output and target values. On the other hand the 
validation data in Figure 6.11 failed to develop regression between output 
and the target values which resulted in no regression during testing. 
The validation and testing has R values as NaN (Not a number). The

6.3.2 Analysis of Single response 
With the aid of the orthogonal array L9, different sands are used to test the 
performance of the grooving process. Equation (6.1) calculates the single- 
response value of S/N ratios Time (T) Table 6.9. Table 6.10 suggests 
the character mean values of S/N ratios of Time (T) responses. It may be 
determined that the most suitable combination A3B3 is biggest value of S/N 
ratios of Time. Therefore, A3B3 is the optimal combination of response Time.

The best condition for Time is level 3 (Type 3) of sand type and level 3 
(5.5 bar) of pressure, as shown in the major effect plots (Figure 6.7). 
To determine which parameter has a significant influence on performance 
characteristics, a statistical software with an ANOVA analytical tool is used. 
Table 6.4 indicates the ANOVA findings for single-response S/N ratios of 
Time (seconds) for single-response S/N ratios of Time (seconds). Figure 6.24 
It can be seen that type of sand and pressure both effects the phenomena 
significantly. Comparatively type of sand effects the more significantlyhaving 
the P value 0.000 whereas pressure have P value of 0.001. It is observed that 
the type of sand is one of the important factor that has more impact on 
machining followed by pressure on time. 
As shown in Figure 6.25, the normality plot demonstrates that nearly 
the residuals comply with a straight line, suggesting that the recommended 
version is fit. The residual vs fitted plot as shown in Figure 6.26, indicates the 
randomized allotment on each aspect of the reference line of all residuals.

Additionally, there is no pattern in the residual vs observation order plot as 
per Figure 6.27, which is required for significant ANOVA. This confirms that 
the suggested model will have a good future outcome if all four tests are 
satisfied.

Figure 6.28 shows the effect of variation of the pressure and time required 
for drilling. From figure, it is clear that maximum time for the drilling is 
required in case of lime sand where as minimum in case of coarse sand. 
Maximum time of 16.7 seconds were observed at a pressure of 3.5 bar in case

of lime sand whereas lowest time of 6.8 seconds at a pressure of 5.5 bar was 
recorded in case of coarse sand. 
6.4 CONCLUSIONS 
With increased pressure and decreasing glass thickness and SOD, the MRR 
rises. The pressure is proportional to the MRR. With an increase in the nozzle 
pressure time required for the drilling decreases continuously. By reducing 
the pressure from 5.5 to 3.5 bars, time increases from 10 to 15 seconds, 12.99 
to 16.7, and 6.8 to 11.6 in the case of Roasted Sand, Lime+sand and Coarse 
Sand as an abrasive respectively. For material removal the kinetic energy of 
the abrasive particle is responsible during the erosion process as pressure 
increases. The MRR rises with an increase in SOD until a certain point, at 
which time it falls with an increase in SOD. As the SOD of the workpiece, 
nozzle jet, and abrasive mesh size reduce, the abrasive mixture impinges 
on the workpiece more directly, without deflecting, and with more force, the 
MRR increases, leading in a higher removal rate. The neural network 
methodology shows the overall regression thus falls down to 0.819 from full 
R-Values and the developed linear model for R = 0.8819 is time = 0.96 × 
Target values + 0.028. It shows the Best validation performance with trainbr.

7.1 INTRODUCTION 
Fiber-reinforced plastic composites are two-phased materials with mechan-
ical and thermal properties, which carry in difficult interactions among the 
matrix and the reinforcement throughout machining. Glass fiber–reinforced 
plastic composite (GFRP) brought a lot of change in the materials used in 
industries as they are cheap. Glass fiber–reinforced polymers are put into 
multiple uses that are subjected to gas, oil, and acidic environments. 
Machining of composites has been a difficult situation, leading to a slew of 
difficulties such as yarn fuzzing, matrix flaming, and shape of fine particles

like chips and fast tool wear, Wang and Zhang (2003) and Davim (2009).  
Santhanakrishnan et al. (1989) used Tic layered carbide, K20 carbide, HSS, 
and P20 carbide for the turning of GFRP, CFRP, and KFRP composite ma-
terials. It was discovered that the K20 carbide insert performances improved 
during machining of FRP composite. 
Surinder Kumar et al. (2013) explored the machining of UD-GFRP com-
posite with a carbide insert. The utility function was used for optimization. 
DOC, speed, and feed were remarkable factors affecting surface irregularity 
and MRR. Srinivas Athreya et al. (2012) used Taguchi’s technique for op-
timization of process parameters in improving the surface irregularity of the 
facing process. It was detected that the cutting speed is more compelling than 
DOC. Karnik et al. (2008) drilled CFRP composite material by a cemented 
carbide (K20) drill. The ANN and trial values were compared to demonstrate 
the model’s efficacy in predicting the delamination factor. Zain et al. (2012) 
considered the influence of machining parameters on the surface roughness 
using ANN and a genetic algorithm. Mayyas et al. (2012) found out the 
optimum machining parameters for drilling of self-lubricated composite 
material using multiple regression analysis (MRA) and ANN and the ANNs 
showed improved outcome compared to MRA. 
Srinivas Athreya et al. (2012) applied the Taguchi process to study the effects 
of turning parameters on the surface roughness. It was established that the 
cutting speed is the most important parameter that affects surface irregularity.  
Meenu et al. (2013) used Taguchi’s technique to perform experiments using a 
polycrystalline diamond cutting insert for the machining of UD-GFRP com-
posites and ANN was used for modeling. Nizam Uddin et al. (2015) performed 
a face turning operation on mild steel, aluminium, and cast iron using a dif-
ferent amount of cutting fluid. The different materials showed a different 
surface finish. Dhakad et al. (2017) performed the facing of poly methyl me-
thacrylate material using a tungsten carbide cutting tool. The experiments were 
performed by three-level full factorial designs by using a CNC lathe machine. 
Over the last few decades, researchers have developed many techniques 
and methods to resolve optimization issues presented in the written text, such 
as particle swarm optimization (Karakuzu and Eberhart, 1995), ant colony 
(Dorigo et al. 2006), simulated annealing algorithm (Suman and Kumar, 
2006), etc. The best possible method finds the best feasible solution for the 
objective function. These heuristic methods are used to discover a good- 
quality solution in difficult problems, as the optimal solution is not possible in 
practicable time because the complete area of probable solutions is to be 
explored (Battle, 2008). The metaheuristic algorithms use probabilistic cri-
teria to explore the position that represents a solution and have the advantage 
of not being captured by local maxima. In this research effort, the machining 
parameters, namely speed (A), feed (B), DOC (C), and approach angle (D) are 
optimized for material removal rate. A comparative examination was per-
formed using experimental values and predicted values obtained through 
commutative analysis and ANN. The Taguchi method under design of an 
130 Evolutionary Optimization of Material Removal Processes 

experiments approach was used for experimentation and artificial neural 
network method under artificial intelligence was selected for modeling of 
parameters to maximize the MRR in turning (dry face turning) of UD-GFRP 
composites, which is commercially obtainable and identified for the several 
use in the auto industry. This method helps to acquire excellent feasible tool 
geometry and cutting conditions for turning of UD-GFRP with a PCD tool. 
7.2 MATERIAL AND METHODOLOGY 
7.2.1 Work Material 
Workpiece material (GFRP rod) used consisted of unidirectional fibers that 
are pulled throughout a resin bathtub into the form of the rod. Because GFRP 
is less expensive than carbon or Kevlar, GFRP rods are employed in this 
work. GFRP has a number of advantages which includes (Harvey and Ansell 
Martin, 2000) easy handling, light weight, additionally well suited with resin 
and timber, high resistance to decomposition, convenient in an acidic at-
mosphere, and better response due to improved resin bonding. Pultrusion 
processed unidirectional GFRP composite rods are used. E-glass and epoxy is 
the fiber and resins, respectively. The properties of substance used are shown 
in Table 7.1. The specifications of this substance are weight of rod 2.300 kg, 
length 840 mm, diameter 42 mm, reinforcement unidirectional (E’ Glass 
Roving), density 1.95–2.1 gm/cc, water absorption 0.07%, and tensile 
strength 6,500 kgf/cm2 and compression strength 6,000 kgf/cm2. 
7.2.2 Experimental Details 
The turning operation is carried out using a PCD tool of 0.8 mm tool nose 
radius. Figure 7.1 shows the geometry of the material of the tool. The dry 
facing was conducted on a NH22–lathe machine with the highest spindle 
velocity of 3,000 rpm and an 11 kW power motor, as shown in Figure 7.2.

Four process parameters, such as cutting velocity (A), feed (B), DOC (C), 
and approach angle (D) are used. Measurements are made three times at 
each setting to record the MRR value. The electronic precision balance type 
instrument shown in Figure 7.3 is used for measuring the weight of MRR. 
The specimens after machining are shown in Figure 7.4. The MRR can be 
calculated as the amount of quantity of material removed in regard to

7.2.3 Selection of Experimental Design 
For modeling and analyzing the effect of variables on performance char-
acteristics, a design of experiment is used (Arbizu and Pérez, 2003). Ranges 
for process parameter are specified in Table 7.2. During this study, the 
larger-the-better principle is considered to make the best use of the material 
removal rate. The S/N ratio for the response is computed as:

The Taguchi L27 orthogonal array with test conditions as specified in  
Table 7.3 is used. An investigational record is composed using an accurately 
planned experiment. The experimental results are used to develop a second- 
order model. 
7.2.4 Multiple Regression Methodology 
In statistics, regression studies cover a wide range of techniques for modeling 
and analyzing a large number of variables, with the focus on the relationship 
between the explained and explanatory factors. Douglas Montogomery et al. 
(2001). A mathematical model is developed for material removal rate. The 
regression equation correlates the explained variable with the explanatory

7.2.5 Artificial Neural Network 
ANN [2009] mimics the human brain and is a kind of artificial intelligence 
technique. ANNs are information processing systems and consist of “neu-
rons” working all together to manage a specific problem. During this 
study, modeling of facing parameters for GFRP using ANN is done. 
A back propagation (BP) multi-layer feed-forward arrangement is used for

this problem. Figure 7.5 shows the architecture of a BP network used for the 
problem. The neuron in the input layer receives input. Each input is multi-
plied by the connection weight. Hidden nodes sum the weighted contribution 
signal and apply activation function and send the output that becomes 
the input for an output layer. Every output neuron sums its weighted input 
signals and finds the output after applying an activation function, shown in  
Figure 7.6. Linear and tan sigmoid are the activation functions for output 
layer and hidden layer, respectively. Each output neuron calculates the dif-
ference between target analogues to input and output and propagates the 
error back and modifies the weights. The delta rule is used for updating 
weights. The change in weight of the neuron is given by Equation 7.4: 
w

y x
=
(

i
(7.4)  
where 
is the learning rate and y is the input to the output neurons, t is the 
objective vector, and y is the output obtained by applying an activation 
function to yin; here, yin is the summation of weighted input. The input and 
the corresponding output (target) are presented to the network until it 
learned the desired relationship. In this research work, cutting speed, feed, 
approach angle, and DOC are defined as input variables and material re-
moval rate as an output parameter.

7.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The effect of explanatory parameters on MRR is found by using L27 OA 
(Table 7.3). Table 7.3 shows the MRR and corresponding S/N ratio using a 
polycrystalline diamond cutting tool with 0.8 mm tool nose radius. The ana-
lysis is performed using an arithmetical package, Minitab −17.0, to measure the 
result of the machining factors on the responses. As an outcome of the 
ANOVA, it can be determined that cutting speed (A), feed (B), and DOC(C), 
have important effects on MRR, while the approach angle (D) has a refusal 
effect at a 95% confidence level. The effect of feed rate is extensively better than 
the speed and DOC. The percent contributions of machining parameters are 
44.69%, 30.38%, and 18.30%, respectively, as specified in Table 7.4. 
The response Table 7.5 shows is the highest contribution of feed (Δ = 
0.03966) on the material removal rate, followed by speed (Δ = 0.02885) 
and DOC (Δ = 0.02520). Table 7.5 shows the optimum machining condi-
tions to be A-550 rpm, B-0.1 mm/rev, C-1.0 mm, and D-75°. The response 
curves for the effects of four explanatory parameters for the common value 
of MRR and S/N ratio are plotted, as revealed in Figure 7.7(A & B).

Figure 7.7(A) shows that the MRR increases as the feed rate and DOC 
increase and it increases with an increase in cutting rate and approach angle 
up to some limit and then it decreases. Residual plots are drawn for mean in  
Figure 7.8. Figure 7.8 shows that each point on the standard plot is very 
close to the straight line. This implies that the records are usual and a small 
variation from the regularity is experimental. Figure 7.8(b–d) also shows 
that the data does not have any distinctive structure. 
7.3.1 Multiple Regression Analysis 
The regression equation is modeled to find the connection between process 
parameters to assess MRR for some combination of factors levels in the 
given range. The efficient association between explained variables with the 
explanatory variables can be postulated by Equation 7.5.

The system consists of four nodes in the input layer and one node in the output 
layer. Three to ten nodes are used in the intermediate layer. The optimum 
numbers of nodes in the intermediate layer are established. The data is nor-
malized and then used to train the network. The parameters shown in Table 7.7 
are used. A cross-validation technique is used to judge the model on unseen 
data. About 60% of the data is used for training, 20% for confirmation, and 
20% data for test. After configuring the ANN, it is trained using the training 
data set and its throughput is evaluated. The training goes on until the desired 
outcome from the ANN is not obtained using input data sets [1996]. 
Figure 7.9 represents the performance plot during the training of ANN. 
The training is stopped when the error started rising in the validation set.

After obtaining the configured network, it is validated and the performance 
is evaluated by creating a regression plot, which shows the relationship 
connecting the outputs of the ANN and the experimental values. For a 
perfect ANN, the network-predicted values and experimental values would 
be accurately the same, but the connection is seldom perfect in actuality.  
Figure 7.10 depicts the regression plots for the developed neural network of 
facing operation for training, validation, and test sets. One can easily ob-
serve that the data is aligned along the line. The R value in each case is close 
to unity (more than 0.9). Where R = 1 represents an excellent linear re-
lationship between predicted and experimentally obtained values. If R is 
near zero, then there is a non-linear connection between the predicted and 
experimental values. Figure 7.11(a) shows the progress of the training al-
gorithm with respect to epochs. From the figure, it is clear that training 
stopped after nine epochs. Figure 7.11(b) represents the histogram plot for

ANN) are compared with experimental values and are tabulated in  
Table 7.8. Figure 7.12 shows the experimental values and those predicted 
by regression and ANN. The mean absolute percentage error obtained by 
ANN and MRM are −13.68% and −17.90%, respectively.

8.1 INTRODUCTION 
MWCNT can be developed using various techniques, out of which che-
mical vapour deposition technique is quite popular. CNTs are less than 
100 nanometers in diameter and can be as thin as 1 or 2 nm. These 
materials are yet to be fully commercialized. The mechanical properties of 
these composites, such as tensile strength and hardness, are found to be 
much better than the monolithic alloy Al6061. Other mechanical properties 
of these composites are much greater than corresponding properties of any 
matrix material. In addition to these properties, there is a pressing need to 
investigate the machining properties of Al6061/MWCNT composites, owing 
to their applications in automobile and aerospace industries. 
For any machining process, in addition to mechanical properties, the 
quality, productivity, and cost are considered to be important output para-
meters (criteria) at the macro level. They also become important parameters 
when the composites made are machined and tested for machining char-
acteristics. Very few researchers have taken these parameters as response 
parameters for analysis as most of them have focused their attention on 
material removal rate, surface finish, cutting forces, tool wear rate, etc., at the 
DOI: 10.1201/9781003258421-9

micro level. It is important to take quality, productivity, and cost as output or 
response parameters whenever the input parameters are tested in wider 
ranges of values. Quality of the machining can be interpreted in terms of 
surface finish and dimensional accuracy. It is important to find parameter 
settings that influence the quality of machining, especially in the case of new 
materials, such as Al6061/MWCNT composites. Input parameters such as 
spindle speed (in rpm), axial depth of cut (mm), feed rate (mm/rev), and radial 
depth of cut (also known as step-over ratio) in the case of CNC milling op-
erations proved to have significant effects on these output parameters [1]. 
Many manufacturers made attempts to reduce the cost by methods such 
as tool selection, problem solving, etc. However, proactive strategies such 
as minimizing the rejected parts and unplanned downtime will help the firm 
in a big way to reduce the costs. After that, the focus should be on man-
ufacturing costs and production rate. Finally, based on strong operations, 
manufacturers should focus on selecting tools and proper cutting conditions 
for optimizing the process. Manufacturers should optimize quality, pro-
ductivity, and cost of a machining process at the macro level to start with 
and then the process can be further improved at the micro level by taking 
output parameters such as surface roughness, material removal rate, etc. It 
is believed that an increase in speed results in producing more parts and, 
hence, an increase in productivity. But an increase in speed also may result 
in faster wearing of tools, generation of heat, and vibration at the work/tool 
interface, and a decline in surface finish along with variation in dimensional 
accuracy. Hence, the speed of the rotating spindle has an influence on 
productivity, cost, and quality of the process. Hence, in this work, spindle 
speed range is taken from 2,000 to 5,000 r.p.m., varying it at three levels. 
Manufacturers should select the highest depth of cuts and larger feed values 
for each operation subject to tool clamping, workpiece fixturing, and ma-
chine tool. The ranges of feed is in 150–250 rev/min, axial depth of cut is in 
0.2–0.4 mm, and radial depth of cut from 0.4–0.6 each at three levels. 
It is difficult to quantify these output parameters for various combinations 
of input process parameters. Neutrosophic sets developed by Smarandhache 
[2] are widely used for handling subjective information in multi-criteria de-
cision making (MCDM). In this research work, the combinations of input 
parameters are taken as various alternatives and the output parameters are 
taken as objectives. It is important to quantify the relationship between se-
lected input process parameters, such as cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of 
cut, and output parameters in order to obtain optimum machining process 
parameters. For this setting, neutrosophic sets, which include indeterminacy, 
are better suited over fuzzy sets. Hence, in this work, neutrosophic sets are 
used to quantify the output variables, such as quality, productivity, and cost 
for a given combination of input variables. 
The technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution 
(TOPSIS) method is used for evaluating, prioritizing, and selecting the best 
alternative and proved to be a better method than many other MCDM 
148 Evolutionary Optimization of Material Removal Processes 

methods [3]. In order to evaluate the weights of the objectives from the 
subjective data provided by experts, the information entropy method is 
found to be effective as it emphasizes that information related to super 
weight indicator is more constructive than lower indicator [4]. Thus, a 
novel method involving the grey relational method coupled with TOPSIS 
using neutrosophic sets is used in this work to find the best alternative. 
Literature relevant to machining process parameters and neutrosophic sets 
is reviewed in Section 8.2. The methodology used for finding out the best 
combination of input process parameters (best alternative) is explained in 
Section 8.3. Section 8.4 covers the results obtained and analysis made. A 
brief account of conclusions is given in Section 8.5. 
8.2 LITERATURE REVIEW 
Single valued neutrosophic sets (SVNSs) have been used in the past decade in 
the area of decision making successfully for representing imprecise, uncertain, 
inconsistent, and indeterminate information. Jun Ye [5] presented a decision- 
making method based on the correlation of intuitionistic fuzzy sets and 
he used a correlation coefficient of SVNSs for analysis. Nirmal N. P. et al. [6] 
developed a new technique for multi-attribute decision making (MADM) for 
converting fuzzy sets into SVNS. They used this method for the selection 
process of automated guided vehicle in industrial application for flexible 
manufacturing context. Karasan Ali et al. [7] developed a novel model with 
occupational health and safety as output parameters and input parameters 
viz., (i) probability, (ii) severity, (iii) detectability, and (iv) frequency as input 
process parameters. He used Pythagorean fuzzy sets in safety and critical 
effect analysis (SCEA) for developing the model. The development of risk 
assessment data was the outcome of this model. Yucesan Melih et al. [8] 
proposed a neutrosophic best and worst method for determining weights of 
failure which was carried out after pairwise comparisons. They constructed a 
flexible model for manufacturing industry by highlighting the contribution of 
knowledge about NBWM in procedure and utilization aspects. 
In the area of manufacturing process design, Reddy Y. Rameswara et al. 
[9] used the design of experiments approach for optimizing surface 
roughness and MRR of super Ni 718 alloy in MCDM context for selected 
machining parameters of the wire electric discharge method. Their study 
was based on orthogonal arrays of the Taguchi method with grey relational 
analysis. They used single valued neutrosophic sets for computing the 
weights of output parameters. A. Rosales et al. [10] proposed a method for 
surface quality in the face milling process and predicted surface roughness 
values from a wide range of cutting parameters experimentally. Benardos 
P.G. et al. [11] predicted surface roughness of the CNC face milling process 
on the basis of an artificial neural network (ANN) approach and Taguchi 
design of experiments (DoE) approach. In their experimentation, cutting 
CNC Milling of Al‐CNT Composites 149 

factors in the face milling operation viz., (i) depth of cut, (ii) cutting speed, 
(iii) cutting forces, and (iv) feed rate, are taken into consideration. They 
obtained 1.86% mean squared error for surface roughness after checking of 
ANNs with the Levenberg-Marqardt algorithm. 
Information entropy with TOPSIS was used by Huang for selection of an 
information system [12], Li et al. to ensure safety in coal mines [13], and 
Sahin and Yigider [14] for adding individual opinions of selected decision 
makers. A neutrosophic-based weighted distance method was used by Liu 
and Luo for MCDM problems [15] and they extended this method to 
interval-valued neutrosophic sets as well. Very few researchers have worked 
in relating the objectives of a manufacturing firm at the macro level with 
machining process parameters at the micro level using neutrosophic fuzzy 
sets for obtaining the best alternative of combinations of input variables 
using entropy-based grey relational TOPSIS. 
8.3 METHODOLOGY 
The following step-wise procedure is used for developing neutrosophic 
fuzzy sets for various objectives (output variables) with the help of experts’ 
opinions, computing the weights of them, and ranking the alternatives using 
grey relational TOPSIS.  
Step 1. To start with, identification of output variables at the macro 
level (firm level) and selection of input variables for a selected 
machining process for machining Al6061/MWCNTs in a man-
ufacturing firm are carried out. For this study, objectives or 
output variables at the macro level, such as quality, productivity, 
and cost, are selected, as mentioned earlier. The process para-
meters for a milling machine viz., (i) cutting speed, (ii) feed, 
(iii) axial depth of cut, and (iv) radial depth of cut (step over 
ratio) are considered for analysis. In multi-criteria decision 
making (MCDM) terminology, various combinations of process 
parameters are considered as alternatives. In the design of ex-
periments, they are known as treatments. 
Step 2. Data are obtained from two experts, one each from the aca-
demics and the manufacturing industry who have at least 
15 years of relevant experience. Input process parameters are 
taken at three levels each and a combination of 27 experiments 
are designed using a L27 array, making the number of alter-
natives 27. The experts are explained about the concepts of 
neutrosophic sets and are requested for values of membership, 
hesitancy and non-membership for each of the output variables 
for the entire set of designed experiments (alternatives). Each 
neutrosophic set for each of the output variable has three values 
150 Evolutionary Optimization of Material Removal Processes 

corresponding to membership, hesitancy, and non-membership. 
The data thus can be represented by a 27 x 18 matrix for output 
variables in which first nine columns are used for expert-1 and 
the rest of the nine columns for expert-2. SVNS is explained, 
along with necessary notations, and used in this work, which is 
as follows: 
A single valued neutrosophic set (SVNS) A on the universe of discourse X 
is defined as A={<x,TA(x),IA(x),FA(x)>,xϵX} where T,I, F:X→[−0,1+] and  
−0≤ TA(x)+IA(x)+FA(x)≤3+. In this, TA(x), IA(x), and FA(x) represent 
the membership degree, hesitancy degree, and non-membership degree, 
respectively.  
Step 3. The opinions of experts are aggregated using the union operator 
of neutrosophic sets in order to obtain a 27 × 9 matrix for the 
output variables. The union operation is performed using 
Equation 8.1 [16]. 
Let Am=(Tm,Im,Fm) and Bn=(Tn,In,Fn) be two SVNNs and the addition of 
these sets are performed as follows:

Step 4. In order to calculate the weightages of the three output variables, 
the information entropy method is used. The entropy method 
works using the information provided by data and the weights of 
output variables can be determined by the size of entropy measure. 
The values of membership degree, hesitancy degree, and non- 
membership degree are combined by the following operators. 
The entropy measure of SVNN, A={<x,TA(xi),IA(xi),FA(xi)>,xϵX} is given by

are obtained.  
Step 5. Normalization using the grey relational and TOPSIS method is 
carried out using neutrosophic sets from the following opera-
tions. Firstly, single-valued neutrosophic relational coefficient 
positive (SVNRCP) X+ and single-valued neutrosophic relational 
coefficient negative (SVNRCN) X− are found using the following 
procedure. 
The SVNRCP X+ is defined as

The above 27 × 9 matrix is reduced to 27 × 3 matrix by converting the 
neutrosophic sets to crisp numbers. 
8.4 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 
The designed experiments with various combinations of spindle speed (V in 
r.p.m.), feed (F in mm/rev), axial depth of cut (d in mm), and radial depth of 
cut (SR in ratio) are given in Table 8.1 along with neutrosophic sets given 
by first expert for the selected three output variables. 
In the above table, for experiment number-1 (alternative 1), expert-1 
provided three values each for each of the output variables representing 
membership (T), hesitancy (I), and non-membership (F) for neutrosophic 
sets. Similarly, the data provided by expert-2 in terms of neutrosophic sets 
are shown in Table 8.2. 
The data provided by both experts is aggregated using an union operator, 
as given in Equation 8.1. The results are shown in Table 8.3 (first nine col-
umns). Entropy calculations are performed for each row using Equation 8.2 
and the results are shown in the last three columns of Table 8.3. 
Table 8.4 gives results of the computations of SVNRCP row-wise. 
Maximum values and minimum values of T, I, and F are computed as follows:      
Tmax = max1≤i≤m (Tij); 
Imax = max1≤i≤m (Iij); 
Fmax = max1≤i≤m (Fij); 
Tmin = min1≤i≤m (Tij); 
Imin = min1≤i≤m (Iij); 
Fmin = min1≤i≤m (Fij);

From the above values of neutrosophic sets, grey relational coefficients 
are computed (using Equation 8.5) after computing the hamming distance 
(using Equation 8.4) for each of the neutrosophic sets of output variables. 
From the grey relational coefficients, SVNRCP is calculated by multiplying 
them with corresponding weights using Equation 8.9 and the results are

shown in Table 8.5. Similarly, SVNRCN is calculated using Equation 8.10. 
The results are given in Table 8.6. 
From Table 8.6, the 24th, 25th, 17th and 27th sets of experiments 
yielded top four maximum values of N. These results are shown in  
Table 8.7. From these results, it may be concluded that high cutting speeds, 
medium values of feed, and medium values of depth of cut (both axial and 
radial) are preferred for best values of quality, productivity, and cost. 
Further experimentation at the micro level can be performed in the speed 
range of 3,500–5,000 r.p.m., feed range of 200–250 rev/min, axial depth of 
cut range of 0.3–0.4 mm, and a radial depth cut of 0.5.

8.5 CONCLUSION 
In this research work, the objectives of the firm, such as optimization of 
quality, productivity, and cost, are taken at the macro level and they are 
studied for various combinations of input machining process parameters 
viz., (i) cutting speed, (ii) feed, (iii) radial depth of cut, and (iv) axial depth 
of cut. Twenty-seven combinations of experiments are considered, making 
the number of alternatives 27. Neutrosophic sets and expert opinions are 
used in order to quantify the subjective judgment of outcomes of various 
combinations of input machining process parameters on the selected ob-
jectives of the firm. The information entropy method is used for computing 
the weights of objectives, hamming distance method, and grey relational 
analysis are used for normalizing and ranking of alternatives is done using 
the TOPSIS method. 
The results obtained are helpful in choosing the ranges of input process 
parameters for conducting experimentation at the micro level. The results 
indicate that the best combination of quality, productivity, and cost is 
obtained at a cutting speed of 5,000 r.p.m, feed of 200 rev/min, axial depth 
of cut of 0.4 mm, and radial depth of cut of 0.5. This study contributes to 
academicians and industrialists in selecting the ranges of manufacturing 
process parameters so that the design of experiments method can be applied 
in that range for further experimentation at the micro level. Further studies 
can be conducted for other types of machining operations, such as turning, 
drilling, etc., also using this expert opinion-based studies with application 
of neutrosophic sets.

9.1 INTRODUCTION 
Machining of hard materials always radiates productive machining techni-
ques to produce economical components with quality assurance. However, 
conventional methods failed to process, owing to tool material constraints. 
Nontraditional machining processes shine as alternative processes to machine 
such hard materials. EDM classified under nontraditional machining retains 
a huge potential for the processing of wider materials irrespective of hardness 
property. Moreover, complex shapes could be portrayed over work material 
make the EDM machine more versatile and robust relative to alternative

nontraditional machining process. Since material removal from the parent 
material is associating with melting and vaporizing of an exposed work area 
rather have physical contact. It establishes a controlled pulse spark to melt the 
exposed work area empowered by a pulse generator whose function is to 
convert continuous AC to pulse DC [1]. 
EDM offers a better alternative solution to do machining of high hard-
ness materials that finds vast applications in aerospace, medical devices, 
electronics, automotive, and optics. Since different materials require dif-
ferent machining conditions of electrical energy variables to get thermal 
erosion and because of that electrical process parameters required to be 
optimized [2]. During machining there is always an optimum gap main-
tained between electrode and workpiece and is monitored by a servo con-
troller, thus eliminating possibilities of mechanical stress or any type of 
vibration [3]. Because of its unconventional nature of doing machining, this 
can be used in many highly demanded application materials like ceramics, 
heat-treated materials, case-hardened materials, and composite [4]. This 
also can be applied to machine extrusion and forging dies along with other 
operations like drilling, milling, and grinding. 
Every machine has its advantages and limitations and hence EDM also has 
some limitations since spark erosions take place in both the electrode and 
workpiece sides. Hence, tool wear taking place as been used continuously for 
a long time. Therefore, it hampers machining and leads to defect productions. 
Hence, research is needed to optimize machining parameters to prevail over, 
and improve, the machining performance. The EDM tool should have good 
machinability, electrically conductive, thermally conductive, and cost effec-
tive [5]. By considering all relevant priorities, copper or graphite tools are 
most commonly used in EDM. This is observed that tool wear is one of the 
failure conditions while doing machining. Many researchers tried to develop 
technology and tested to minimize tool wear rate. Khanra et al. experimen-
tally investigated machining performance by adopting a “ZrB2-Cu” tool and 
recorded the least tool or electrode wear rate as compared to a pure copper 
tool [6]. Novel researchers, Estebean et al. experimentally investigated 
ceramic workpiece material and found excellent machining with a desired 
dimensional accuracy [7]. Another research team, Kiyak et al., attempted to 
analyze the effects of process parameters to machine tool steel with a cupper 
electrode. Based on their experimental result, they gave the conclusion that 
input current I and pulse on ton contribute the most towards a primary 
surface texture of copper tools as well as for the tool steel [8]. Some re-
searchers developed a ZrB2-CuNi tool and narrated its vast applications [9]. 
Review of EDM manifests that several efforts have attempted to bring down 
the TWR minimum and maximize MRR [10]. Fonesca et al. were able draw a 
conclusion that deionization time of dielectric fluid during Toff has a sig-
nificant effect on wear rate of the tool as well as for the removal rate of 
material [11]. Another researcher team, Tang et al., experimentally in-
vestigated and optimized EDM parameters to machine a stainless steel job 
168 Evolutionary Optimization of Material Removal Processes 

and stated a conclusion that the machining input parameter current I and Ton 
(Pulse on) are the two machining parameters that influence a lot to maximize 
MRR and damaging tool or electrode [12]. Researcher team Tsai et al. had 
worked on a Cr/Cu composite-based tool. Based on their result, they have 
arrived at a conclusion that an increase in MRR is reported when the elec-
trode connected is negative but have been detrimental to the interests of 
the surface finish. [13]. A researcher team, Lee et al., had investigated the 
interests of surface cracks and applied a full factorial design approach to get 
the significant effects of EDM parameters [14]. Statistical analysis of he wear 
rate of the tool examined by the researcher team concluded that the ma-
chining parameter current I and Ton, known as “pulse on time,” have sig-
nificant effects [15]. The research team Haron et al. experimentally studied 
two different tool electrodes: copper and graphite. They checked individual 
tool performance on EDM and found the copper tool superior to that of 
graphite while machining the tool steel alloy [16]. The research team Hu et al. 
conducted an experiment on ceramic material and concluded that “melting 
and decomposition” are the two important reasons for material removal [17]. 
Muttamara et al. had marked the effect of material of electrodes to machine 
aluminium in EDM [18]. Bhaumik M. et al. attempted a cryotreated tungsten 
carbide electrode and sic powder on EDM performance of AISI304 and they 
found improved machining efficiency with a combinational effect of a cryo-
treated electrode with sic powder [19]. When sic abrasive powder is mixed 
with dielectric fluid on EDM, there were improved surface characteristics of 
H-11 die steel [20]. However, a gap voltage of an EDM-machined parameter 
found adverse effects to MRR while machining EN19 steel [21]. To improve 
surface quality air and argon gas flushing found more uniform recast layer 
with absence of potholes and cracks on Ti6Al4V alloy [22]. 
It has been observed that several efforts and techniques have been applied 
to bring down the TWR minimum and improve the effectiveness of pro-
ductive efforts of EDM. But from a literature survey, EDM machining 
found lacuna to do machining of stainless steel of AISI 202 grade combined 
with electrode Cu-Cr-Zr alloy. Along with this, RSM technology on EDM 
machining has never been attempted before. Therefore, in this research, 
machining strategy has been made to fill the research gap of EDM para-
metric retrospect against stainless steel of AISI 202 grade specimen. Further, 
ANN has been introduced to predict the experimental result. The results 
indicate that ANN prediction is well aligned with experimental results. 
9.2 EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS 
9.2.1 Details of the Tool Electrode 
The copper-based alloy material copper-chromium-zirconium (Cu-Cr-Zn) 
has been employed for making the electrode. Since Zn improves the strength 
EDM of AISI 202 with Cu‐Alloy Electrode 169 

and retains electrical conductivity at a high temperature, Cu and Cr add value 
to electrical conductivity and mechanical strength, respectively; thus, to catch 
all those indispensable properties, Cu-Cr-Zn has been employed. The details

9.2.3 Design of Experiment 
The RSM (response surface methodology) technique was studied and ap-
plied to design the experiment and optimized EDM machining parameters 
to get the best result. This is because RSM has a statistical algorithm that 
can convert a response into a mathematical model and can be used to 
analyze the problem with the least number of experimental runs without 
damaging accuracy [23]. Here, a RSM 2k factorial design is adopted to 
design the experimental run, record results, and compute a second-order 
polynomial regression equation for MRR and EWR [24]. The RSM ob-
jective is to analyze the role of the EDM process parameters against various 
EDM output responses [25]. RSM helps to find the significance effect of 
EDM process parameters towards responses. A basic second-order poly-
nomial regression equation can be of following:

where Y is the response that can be MRR and EWR, constants βo, βi, βii, βij 
represent second-order regression coefficients, and Xi (i varies from 1, 2, 3 
… n) is the quantitative machining variable. Three experimental machining 
process parameters with three levels are selected based on best perfor-
mances, represented in Table 9.1. These parameters were taken based on 
literature to acquire the best experimental result. 
The output parameters: MRR and TWR are quantified using the following 
equation presented in Equations (9.2) and (9.3). The weight of the work and 
tool materials for each run were measured by using a weighing machine: 
MRR = premachining workpiece weight

9.3 CHARACTERIZATION 
Herein, a scanning electron microscope (SEM) was incorporated to study 
the physical behavior of processed material in a micron level and can detect 
any unexpected aspect of defect so that it can be avoided further. SEM 
micrographs with SEM LEO 435 VP, resolution of 6 nm VP, and 4 nm HV 
at various magnification ranges from 500X to 6.00KX were used. 
9.4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
All of the precise data for each experiment was brought together in one 
edition and was mathematically applied to get the values of the electrode or 
tool erosion rate and MRR. All machining data and calculated response 
values are presented in Table 9.2. 
After getting machining data, the optimization technique was executed to 
get optimized EDM process parameters, setting a combination that satisfied 
industrial interests of least electrode or tool wear rate and highest material

removal rate of AISI 202 stainless steel. Table 9.3 presents optimal EDM 
machining parameters to get the best responses. 
9.4.1 Mathematical Representation of Different Responses 
By using RSM, all experimental runs have been performed and the collected 
data applied in MINITAB 17 software. MINITAB 17 is a statistical software 
with RSM methodology to get the best experimental solution. This software 
solution can help to perform machining analysis. By applying the RSM ap-
proach, the different responses can be converted into a mathematical model 
from which significant effects of input parameters can be identified. A re-
gression equation was derived from the RSM statistical approach and pre-
sented bellow in Equations (9.4) and (9.5) for EWR and MRR:

9.4.2 Analysis of Variance 
Analysis of variance, commonly known as ANOVA, uses a statistical ap-
proach to find the sum of squares of variances (SS), adj. mean square (Adj. 
MS), and F value calculated [26]. ANOVA is performed to know the sig-
nificant effect of paramount machining parameters on responses so that 
further study can be controlled and improved. In this work, the F value is 
calculated by dividing the adjacent mean square of a variable into the adj. 
mean square of error and p-value computed for TWR at a 90% confidence

level, presented in Table 9.4. Similarly, ANOVA is obtained for MRR, 
presented in Table 9.5. Since R2 and adjusted R2 value comes to 90 to 95%, 
therefore the experiment performed is satisfied. Here it shows each ma-
chining parameter significantly contributes toward responses of MRR and 
TWR, respectively, linearly as well as square level but not contributed by a 
combined or interaction effect. 
9.4.3 EDM Machining Parameters Influence on MRR 
Studied the effect of EDM process parameter pulse current I, pulse off-time 
Toff, pulse on-time Ton towards improvement of MRR performance. By 
using statistical software, a 3D surface plot has been generated for ana-
lyzing the silent feature of machining parameters, presented in Figure 9.3. 
MRR is directly proportional to pulse current, clearly observed in 
Figure 9.3. A significant MRR is detected at a high pulse current with a high 
pulse on-time. A similar trend was observed for pulse off-time, depicted in 
Figure 9.3(b). This depicts that as Toff increases with respect to pulse cur-
rent; more time is invested for the flushing of debris, which encourages a 
debris-free surface for next-step machining. From Figure 9.3(c), it has been

EDM of AISI 202 with Cu‐Alloy Electrode 175 

concluded that low pulse off-time disheartens MRR and this phenomenon 
may occur due to inefficient removal of debris that obstructs the machining 
process significantly. Thus, the remaining deposited sludge is exposed to the 
next-step pulse and obstructs the transit of heat originated from a pulsed 
spark and is unable to transfer a hit to the fresh work material consequence 
MRR reduction. Hence, high pulse off-time encourages flourishing removal 
of sludges from the machining zone and adequate heat transfer to the fresh 
work area and MRR improve significantly. This study portrayed that the 
Toff duration has significant effects on the removal of material. 
9.4.4 Study of the Surface Alteration 
An EDM machined surface and tool surface are investigated by SEM. Since 
the machined surface undergoes various temperature changes such as get-
ting heated by sparking and getting cooled by dielectric flushing, hence the 
machined surface is investigated by SEM for a detailed study at optimum 
controllable parameters. The machined surface is obtained at a machined 
parameter: pulse current 9 A, pulse on-time 75 µs, and pulse off-time 9 µs, 
respectively, was studied by SEM. Similarly, the electrode surface was in-
vestigated at an optimum parametric setting: pulse current 5 A, pulse on- 
time 65 µs, and pulse off-time 7 µs, respectively. The surface generated by 
an optimum setting is illustrated in Figure 9.4. 
Remarkable changes on a machined surface have been reported froman 
SEM figure for workpiece material. The presence of micro-cracks and a 
recast layer are clearly visible in Figure 9.4(b). This physical alteration of 
the machined surface that appeared as micro-cracks shows that a greater 
amount of thermal stress developed due to a high temperature environment 
and sudden drop by quenching. The thermal stress generated by the tem-
perature change at a local area led to forming micro-cracks. Moreover, the 
presence of a recast layer depicts the debris obtained due to melted and 
burned material drop that is unable to be flushed from the machining zone. 
Figure 9.4 Post-machining analysis of a tool surface and AISI 202 grade stainless steel at an 
optimum setting: (a) 5 A pulse current effect on tool surface, (b) 9 A pulse 
current effect on AISI 202 grade stainless steel.    
176 Evolutionary Optimization of Material Removal Processes 

Thus, flushing pressure could be incorporated to overpower the recast de-
position. Moreover, micro-cracks developed due to increased residual 
stresses resulting from non-homogeneities within a white layer [27]. The 
melted materials were quenched by dielectric fluid forming debris deposited 
over a machined surface, forming a white layer. The microstructure of bulk 
material does not affect EDM machining [28]. 
The tool surface was embossed with globules and a white layer, as shown in 
Figure 9.4(a). The discussion agrees with the practical change. The deposited 
globule percentages are more; it protects the tool surface from thermal erosion; 
hence, electrode wear rate decreases significantly. The presence of a white layer 
also helps to endure the thermal erosion. 
9.5 ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN) 
An ANN is an algorithm inspired from an animal brain working principle 
to solve linear and nonlinear engineering problems very effectively. ANN is 
a computing system has an input layer and an output layer with a number 
of hidden layers connected with a number of neurons (processing elements). 
The parallel architecture of ANN enables a fast computing process com-
pared to other conventional technique as all the neurons in between all the 
layers work simultaneously [29]. Due to the complex nature of EDM ma-
chining process, it is very tough to accurately predict the machining process 
and it gets easier by ANN modeling. Since ANN is superior to RSM, 
therefore, in this present work EDM modeling with a feed-forward back 
propagation neural network with two layers and 20 neurons is adopted 
using a MATLAB ANN tool for MRR [30]. The optimal structure is cre-
ated by the trial-and-error method by changing the number of neurons and 
finding the best fit with a minimum MSE and maximum R value with more 
than a 95% confidence level, depicted in Figure 9.5 for MRR. The predicted 
result is compared to the experimental result listed in Table 9.4. The de-
veloped model is well trained and gave an average error of 0.05%. Weights 
were reassigned to reduce error through back propagation during training 
of the data using Equation (9.6), where O represents output, T represents 
target, and P represents input patterns, respectively. The Bayesian reg-
ularization (BR) algorithm was incorporated for the training of the data 
and a log sigmoid activation function was introduced to both the input and 
output layers. A set of experiments was conducted and their results were 
taken for training of the data. Figure 9.6 depicts a comparison between 
experimental MRR with ANN-predicted MRR.

9.6 CONCLUSION 
This research article communicates the EDM machining potential to ma-
chine AISI 202 grade stainless steel. Further optimization of machining 
parameters is obtained by performing response surface methodology. The 
machined surface and tool surface were examined by SEM and extrapolate 
the technicality for the improvement. Further, the ANN model was ex-
ercised to predict the experimental result and found a good agreement with 
the result. The optimum parameter obtained to elevate MRR was: pulse 
current 9 A, pulse on-time 75 µs, and pulse off-time 9 µs, respectively. 
Similarly, an optimum parametric setting for reducing tool wear rate was 
pulse current 5 A, pulse on-time 65 µs, and pulse off-time 7 µs, respectively. 
The SEM study revealed that at a higher current setting, MRR improved 
but micro-cracks were attained due to residual thermal stress. Moreover, 
the presence of globules and a white layer helped to reduce the erosion rate 
of the electrode significantly.

10.1 INTRODUCTION 
Because there is contactless operating, micro-electrochemical machining 
(micro-ECM) may be able to produce the greater surface integrity. Numerous 
physical and chemical processes, including heat transfer, electrolyte flow, 
electrochemical reactions, and electric field transmission, among others, take 
place concurrently during micro-electrochemical machining. Faraday’s law of 
electrolysis serves as the foundation for the ECM process. During the

electrochemical machining operation (NaNO3), the tool electrode and the 
workpiece are both submerged in an electrolytic concentration of sodium 
nitrate [1]. We have managed a tiny gap between the two electrodes with no 
tool wear, mechanical forces, or residual stresses by applying voltage at a 
consistent value between the tool electrode and the workpiece. In electro-
chemical machining (ECM), the workpiece acts as an anode (positive) and the 
tool electrode as a cathode side. When DC power is applied between the two, 
the anodic material may be dissolved. 
10.1.1 Micro-Electrochemical Machining 
Three-dimensional microstructures like micro-holes and micro-grooves may 
be created using a micro-electrochemical machining method. Many in-
dustrial uses, particularly aerospace engineering, automotive engineering, 
and microelectronics, use micro-electrochemical machining. Figure 10.1 
The workpiece is set in a frame, the tool is introduced into a tool post, 
and both are held extremely near to one another so that the inter-electrode 
spacing may be maintained. The inter-electrode gap (IEG) is the space be-
tween the tool and the workpiece. A potential difference is introduced 
around across tool and workpiece after submerging them in a liquid elec-
trolyte (such as NaCl), and material removal starts. 
10.1.2 Materials 
Due to its strong corrosion resistance, high tensile strength, high temperature 
resistance, and high yield strength, Nimonic-263 alloy was chosen for this 
experiment. Casing, rings, and fabrication sheets made of the Nomonic-263 
alloy have been utilised in the aerospace applications and on aviation turbine 
engines. The alloy Nimonic-263 has strong heat conductivity. It is ductile at 
high temperatures in welded constructions.

184 Evolutionary Optimization of Material Removal Processes 

The surface quality has been improved with feed rate of 0.4 mm/min. 
Thomas Bergs et al. 2020 [2] Conducted ECM is working on pure ce-
mentite material (Fe3c) with tool material of 42CrMo4 which is kept in 
rotation with the speed of 20 to 40 m/s and in this study, two major ma-
chining parameters (such as feed rate Vf and voltage U) have been studied 
and the conclusion of a process certificate for electrochemical machining 
has been effectively carried out for the change of the localized phase con-
centration and surface grinding. Shunda Zhan et al. 2020 [3] Utilizing 
certain machining parameters, like inlet/outlet pressure (0.30/0.08 MPa), 
applied voltage (20 V), feed rate (0.3 mm/min), and initial gap, the per-
formed ECM process enhanced the machining accuracy of the blade leading 
edge by 41.79% (0.5 mm). Wenjian Cao and others 2020 [4] Carried 
counter-rotating electrochemical machining to create thin-walled revolving 
parts. The beginning inter-electrode gap decreased (0.272–0.158 mm) with 
respect to increasing (11–15 V), and the inter-electrode gap continued to 
increase after the transitional period because the relative equilibrium 
MRR is greater than the corresponding feed rate. X.L. Chen and others 
2020 [5,6] Three electrolyte flow modes and induced ECM of micro-
channels with coated porous cathodes have been used, with jet flow type 
pulse duty cycle 20% more beneficial to reducing the surface roughness of 
the microgrooves, standard error, as well as machining parameters such as 
temperature (250 C), frequency (2 kHz), duty cycle (20%, 40%, 60%, 
80%), machining time (10 s), voltage (10, 15, 20, 25 V), and pressure (0.4 
MPa). Wang, Feng, et al. 2020 [7] Utilising synchronised electrochemical 
machining, a spheroid hole’s surface quality could be enhanced, and by 
raising, the amplitude of the sidewall and the curvature of the fillet were 
essentially lowered, affecting the efficiency of the rhombus hole. 
10.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
To carry out the experimental investigation on the Nimonic-263 alloy with 
micro-ECM. A workpiece made of the Nimonic-263 alloy measuring 1 cm × 
1 cm has been utilised for the experiments. Micro-drilling operations have 
been carried out using micro-electrochemical machining. The various input 
process variables, such as applied voltage, feed rate, pulse frequency, and 
electrolyte solution, have been taken into consideration to conduct an 
experiment to examine the effects of machining inputs in order to obtain 
micro-holes with a high precision profile and acceptable surface quality. The 
material’s elemental makeup is listed in Table 10.1. Nimonic-263, a nickel- 
based superalloy, has been subjected to micro-electrochemical machining for 
testing. On the basis of the Taguchi L16 orthogonal array method [8], the 
experiments were created. We chose four parameters with four fixed levels. 
Initial holes were drilled into the Nimonic-263 alloy that use the micro-ECM 
method and the optimum settings, and each hole was subsequently machined

independently. After multiple tries, the ideal parameters for micro-drilling 
have been achieved. In this experiment, sodium nitrate (NaNO3) was em-
ployed as the electrolyte solution and copper has been used as the tool 
electrode. This little ECM system has a maximum voltage of 10 volts, a pulse 
frequency range of 5 to 150 kilohertz, and a feed rate range of 20 to 50 mi-
crons per minute. For further investigation, the output response’s average 
value has been selected. The material removal rate (MRR) has been in-
vestigated as a key output response variable in this experimental investiga-
tion. In this experiment, the impacts of process input parameters on response 
parameters, such as material removal rate, have been examined using 
Taguchi’s L16 orthogonal array approach (MRR). 
The inputs used were the applied voltage, pulse frequency, electrolyte 
concentration, and feed rate [8]. Factors are categorised on four different 
levels. For several experiments, the electrolyte solution has been regularly 
replaced with brand-new electrolyte solution. Table 10.2 displays the 
chosen machine inputs together with the identified level of each input. The 
proposed L16 orthogonal array (OA) for carrying out the tests is shown in  
Table 10.3. To compare productivity and accuracy, the micro-holes were 
made using a systematic technique, and the material removal rate was used 
to gauge the significance of the results.

10.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The signal to noise (S/N) ratio has been used to calculate the effect of 
parameter level on output parameter. Micro-ECM setup via a specific set of 
16 experiments may be used to drill micro-holes. 
Tables 10.3 and 10.4 both show the average material removal rate and 
the S/N ratio for every output response, respectively. The highest mean S/N 
ratio among the values determines the factor’s optimal level [8]. The MRR 
for SN ratios ANOVA findings are shown in Table 10.4. The material re-
moval rate (MRR) for means and the ANOVA findings are shown in

10.3.1 Material Removal Rate for Means 
This answer establishes the process performance. A high MRR denotes 
greater output, and Figure 10.2’s major effect chart shows: It has been 
determined that the following input parameters are the best ones: applied 
voltage (10 V), electrolyte concentration (70 g/l), pulse frequency (50 kHz), 
and feed rate (0.05 mm/min). The input machining parameters A4, B4, C1, 
and D4 indicate. With these settings, the material removal process may be 
enhanced. Less current would be created at low voltage, which would result 
in less material being removed. A higher signal-to-noise ratio is preferable 
for MRR optimisation. Figure 10.2 
This graph displays the means’ major impacts plot while also noting the 
MRR values:

• The quantity of material removed continuously increased as the vol-
tage value raised from 7 to 9 volts, but beyond that point, the MRR 
values only slightly increased. Minimum MRR at level one’s 7 V.  
• When the electrolyte concentration is raised from 40 g/l to 50 g/l, the 
quantity of material will rise. As a result, the MRR will slightly in-
crease until the electrolyte concentration is increased to 60 g/l.  
• The most quantity of material may be eliminated at the lowest pulse 
frequency frequency of 50 kHz, following which the MRR will 
slightly reduce up to the pulse frequency of 125 kHz before increasing 
once more at pulse frequencies of 75 kHz and 125 kHz. 
• This graph shows how feed rate affects MRR over time as MRR in-
creases continuously up to a feed rate of 0.05 mm/min.

• Figure 10.4 displays the residuals’ normal probability charts for MRR. 
The normally distributed curve is shown as a straight line. MRR values 
between the normal percentage of probability and the residuals are il-
lustrated by the normal probability plot graph. The normal probability 
plot, which depicts the polynomial regression model and keeps all of the 
data points in close proximity to the polynomial regression line, is used 
to analyse the experimental MRR values.  
• The MRR values between the residuals and fitted values graph are shown 
by the versus fits graph. During a multiple regression, a “residuals versus 
fits plot” is the most typical visual produced. This figure may be used to 
find non-linearity, mismatched error variances, and outliers. The fitted 
values are on the x-axis, while the residuals are on the y-axis.  
• The histogram displays a frequency versus residuals graph to depict 
the MRR values. The residual histogram may be used to examine how 
evenly the variation is spread.  
• The connection between the residual and the observation order is 
shown by the versus order plot. In order to detect the mistake in the 
sequence that is near to each other, a residual versus observation order 
graph was created regardless of how the data were gathered in space. 
10.3.4 Residual Plots for SN Ratios 
The MRR values are being observed at various factors while this graph 
displays the residual plots for SN ratios. Similar to the residual plot for 
means, the residual plot for SN ratios represents all values. Figure 10.5

10.4 PREDICTION OF MRR VALUES THROUGH THE ANN 
MODEL 
Based on the input parameters such as feed rate, electrolyte concentration, 
pulse frequency, and applied voltage. The material removal rate has been 
calculated at the time of machining of Nimonic-263 alloy. A multi-layer 
neural network is where two hidden layers were selected of 20 neurons each 
is added to predict the data. The ANN model has been trained by the 
Bayesian regulation of MATLAB. This regularisation can handle improper 
data by solving the problems underfitting and overfitting. Table 10.6 shows 
the statistical data of MRR for ANN. 
10.4.1 Artificial Neural Network Model 
The neural network used as shown in Figure 10.6 has four input neurons 
such as feed rate, electrolyte concentration, pulse frequency, and applied 
voltage also has two hidden layers containing 20 neurons each (as per ac-
curacy level) and finally, there is one output neuron (MRR). For training 
the data, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was used for better results, 
and further random data division and for performance mean square error 
are used as parameters for ANN. According to the Figure 10.6, w and b are 
the assigned weights and biases for the neurons; further, the value of the 
material removal rate has been predicted by using the 4–20-20-1 structure 
Figure 10.5 Residual plots for MRR (SN ratios).

for both cryogenic-treated CBN due to better accuracy. Figure 10.6 shows 
the structure used in the model. 
Figure 10.7 reveals that the experimental runs 1, 4, 13, and 14 have 
different values as compared to the predicted value of ANN. Further, ex-
periment numbers 1, 4, 6, 13, and 16 have higher MRR values. Figure 10.7 
shows the comparison between predicted values through ANN and ex-
perimental values for NC-CBN. 
Figure 10.8 shows the plot between mean square error (MSE) and six 
epochs with a non-cryogenic-treated CBN data set. In ANN, an epoch is one 
cycle through the full training data set. Figure 10.8 further shows that the best 
validation has occurred at one epoch, which means one cycle is implemented 
for full training of the data set in the case of non-cryogenic-treated CBN.

the ANN model as the experimental values.

10.5 CONCLUSION 
The current experimental work presents the experimental technique of 
machining input parameters to evaluate the material removal rate. 
Micro-drilling operations have been carried out to produce micro-holes 
on Nimonic-263 alloy. A systematic strategy was employed to collect 
all of the data needed for experimentation and design. An artificial 
neural network model can be used to determine the predicted data of 
material removal rate and can also be used to evaluate the error between 
experimental values and predicted values of material removal rate. 
The findings are based on experimental data at four levels and the 
Taguchi L16 orthogonal technique to determine the best process 
parameters.  
• The optimal parametric observation for meanings A4, B4, C1, and D4 
(applied voltage 10 V, electrolyte concentration 70 g/l, pulse fre-
quency 50 kHz, and feed rate 0.05 mm/min) has been explored based 
on the micro-ECM operation.  
• The optimal parametric observation has been examined for SN ratios 
A4, B4, C4, and D4 based on the micro-ECM operation.

• The two factors that have the most effects on the workpiece are the 
supplied voltage and feed rate.  
• In the current experiment, the most material may be removed when 
the following conditions are met: applied voltage of 10 V, electrolyte 
concentration of 70 g/l, pulse frequency of 50 kHz, and feed rate of 
0.05 mm/min.  
• By employing MINITAB software, better outcomes in terms of design 
of experiments (DOE) methodology have been obtained. 
• In order to compute predicted MRR values, an artificial neural net-
work (ANN) model was used.  
• Due to its higher accuracy, the 4–20-20-1 structure has been used to 
forecast the value of the material removal rate for both cryogenically 
treated CBN.

11.1 INTRODUCTION 
The various simple to complex components have been machined on a milling 
machine with various types of machining operations. End milling operation is 
used to produce slots, flat surfaces and profiles by using an end milling cutter. 
Reddy Sreenivasulu et al. [2019] [1] used the grey-based Taguchi approach 
integrated with entropy measurement for glass fiber–reinforced polymer ma-
trix composite for optimization. S. Ajith Arul Daniel et al. [2019] [2] used ANN 
and the Taguchi grey relation analysis to optimize the input variables like 
cutting speed, feed, depth of cut, mass fraction, and particle size of SiC for the 
milling process of Al5059-SiC-MoS2. I.A. Daniyan et al. [2021] [3] used re-
sponse surface methodology to find out the correlation of the end milling 
process parameters in terms of optimization. The experiment has been con-
ducted on the DMU80monoBLOCK Deckel Maho 5-axis CNC milling ma-
chine for AA6063. The mathematical and optimization model has been 
developed based on numerical value and physical experiment results.

optimization have been used for achieving the optimum condition for 
minimum surface roughness with minimum burr formation. Ti-6Al-4V tita-
nium alloy has been used for experimentation. Trung‑Thanh Nguyen et al. 
[2020] [5] used adaptive simulated annealing for optimization of end milling 
process parameters to improve the energy efficiency and power factor with 
minimum surface roughness. Radius basic neural network has been used for 
prediction purposes. Rajeswari S. et al. [2018] [6] used grey fuzzy logic for 
multi-objective optimization of cutting variable for minimum surface rough-
ness and tool wear. Jakeer Hussain Shaik et al. [2018] [7] used a finite element 
model to improve the dynamic stability of end milling operation. Analysis of 
variance and artificial neural network have been used to study the effect of 
input variables on output and prediction. Nuraini Lusi et al. [2020] [8] 
optimized end milling process parameters for ASSAB-XW 42. The Taguchi 
method with grey relational analysis has been used for multi-response 
optimization. M. Jebaraj et al. [2019] [9] investigated the effect of input vari-
ables on responses for end milling operation on Al 6082-T6 alloy. They used 
TOPSIS and analysis of variance for statistical analysis. It reveals that some 
work has been done for prediction and optimization of the milling process with 
experimentation. It is also found that, after the experimentation, researchers 
have used different artificial intelligence techniques for specified materials. 
Additionally, the use of input parameters of the machining process with me-
chanical property of material are not involved in previous procedures. 
11.2 MATHEMATICAL MODEL 
Mathematical model has been developed based on input variables of the 
end milling process. The tool life has been calculated through Equation 
(11.1) [10].

Where n and c are constants determined by the work tool pair and cutting 
condition. 
The DOE is a logical methodology to determine the arrangement of 
machining variables for required outputs for investigation aspects [14]. 
Here, the full factorial method has been implemented for the DOE. For a 
full factorial design, if the L is the numbers of levels and M is the number of 
factors, then the possible design N is 
N
L
=
M
(11.7)  
Here five numbers of levels and three numbers of factors have been selected 
and based on Equation (11.7) for a total of 125 combinations have been 
achieved through Minitab 17 software. A design data book has been used 
for a range selection of cutting variables [15]. In this study, selected factors 
are cutting speed with five levels (140, 150, 160, 170, 180), feed with five 
levels (0.12, 0.15, 0.18, 0.21, 0.24), depth of cut with five levels (0.2, 0.4, 
0.6, 0.8, 1), and also AISI1020 material properties such as density and 
hardness have been selected. 
11.3 MULTI-OJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION 
In industries required the optimization of multiple objectives instead of a 
single objective. MATLAB R2015a with the MOGA tool has been utilized 
for the optimization of multi-responses. The objective functions have been 
generated for required maximum and minimum values of responses with its 
constraints. A multi-objective empirical-based mathematical model has 
been achieved based on a mathematical model.

11.4 EXPERIMENTATION 
The JYOTI computer numerical control VMC machine has been used for 
experimentation. A total of 25 tests have been carried out for validation of 
the results achieved by the mathematical model. The vertical milling center 
with the KISTLER dynamometer is shown in Figure 11.4. Here, AISI1020 
material was used for experimentation with 130 BHN hardness and 7,860 
kg/m3 density. The chemical composition of AISI1020 is 0.565% of Mn, 
0.026% of P, 0.039% of S, 0.197% of C, 99.100% of Fe. The work spe-
cimen before the experimentation with initial level, material properties 
testing level, and operation level are shown in Figure 11.5. 
At the operation, the workpieces are located and held on the KISTLER 
dynamometer through the drilled hole. 
During the experimentation total of 25 work specimens (100 x 50 x 10) 
has been prepared for 25 data sets. The work specimens after the end 
milling operation are shown in Figure 11.6. 
Figure 11.3 Average spread with generation.

The 12 mm diameter end mill with 4 flutes has been used for cutting op-
eration [16]. The experimental values of MRR calculated based on weight of 
workpieces before and after the experimentation. Tangential cutting force 
and torque have been measured through KISTLER dynamometer. Machining 
time has been measured through stopwatch and power has been calculated 
based on experimental values of tangential cutting force. The experimental 
results of 25 data sets are shown in Table A1 (Appendix).

11.5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The comparison of results achieved by experiments and empirical equation- 
based mathematical model for machining time is shown in Figure 11.7. The

The outcomes indicate the mean square error between the numerical model 
and the test results of torque have been seen as 10%. 
The comparison of results achieved by experiments and empirical 
equation-based mathematical model for power is shown in Figure 11.11. 
The outcomes indicate the mean square error between the numerical 
model and the test results of power have been seen as 7.57%. The com-
parison of results achieved by experiments and empirical equation-based 
mathematical model for tool life is shown in Figure 11.12. The outcomes 
indicate the mean square error between the numerical model and the test 
results of tool life have been seen as 0%. 
It has been revealed that the results of the empirical-based mathematical 
model matched the experimental results. It shows positive agreement with 
experimental results. This empirical relation has been used in the MOGA 
tool for multi-objective optimization. The optimum combination of end 
milling process parameters of 18 non-dominated Pareto optimal solutions 
achieved through MOGA is shown in Table A2 (Appendix). The relation 
between the number of individuals and score is shown in Figure 11.13,

related to constraint function. The minimum and maximum values of re-
sponses are shown in Table 11.3. 
The point of the Pareto optimal front is shown in Figure 11.14 produced 
through the MOGA tool of selected responses. 
One set of experiments has been conducted for validation of the MOGA 
results (Sr No. 10, Table A2). It has been found the percentage of error for 
machining time is 13.167%, MRR is 3.199%, tangential cutting force is 
6.260%, torque is 0.527%, power is 6.260%, and tool life is 0.347%.  
Figure 11.15 indicated the good agreement of MOGA and experimental 
results. This multi-objective optimization approaches provide the optimum 
combination of input variables for given values of output parameters. It has 
been observed that all the solution generated by the MOGA tool is good. 
The preference of selection of Pareto optimal solutions depend upon the 
need of industries.

11.6 CONCLUSION 
The multi-objective genetic algorithm approaches utilized to multi-objective 
optimization based on empirical mathematical equations have been found 
very useful techniques in industries. The mathematical results provide 
average accuracy for machining time is 91.65%, material removal rate 
is 92.03%, tangential cutting force is 92.43%, torque is 90%, power is 
92.43%, and tool life is 100%, when compared with results achieved by the 
experiment. MOGA gave the optimal solution with a maximum tool life is 
59.343 minutes, MRR is 229.331 m3/sec, minimum tangential cutting force 
is 341.665 N, torque is 209.041 Kgf.mm, power is 0.797, machining time is 
1.563 sec with 140.016 m/min. of cutting speed, 0.24 mm/tooth of feed, 
and 0.950 mm of the depth of cut. It has been found the average accuracy of 
machining time is 86.833%, MRR is 96.801%, tangential cutting force is 
93.74%, torque is 99.473%, power is 93.74%, and tool life is 99.653%. 
The results of the MOGA correspond with experimental results. This in-
dicates that the multi-objective genetic algorithm is capable of giving the 
optimum cutting condition of input variables for the end milling operation. 
This study is useful for the industries to increase the productivity and de-
crease the consumption of power, cost, and time of production.

12.1 INTRODUCTION 
In micro-electrochemical machining, many physical and chemical processes 
happen at the same time, such as heat transfer, electrolyte flow, electro-
chemical reactions, and the distribution of electric fields, etc. Because it is 
contactless, micro-electrochemical machining (micro-ECM) has the 
DOI: 10.1201/9781003258421-13

potential to provide high-quality surface integrity. The ECM method is 
based on Faraday’s law of electrolysis. During the electrochemical ma-
chining process (NaNO3), both the tool electrode and the workpiece are 
submerged in an electrolytic concentration of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) [1]. 
We have sustained a tiny gap between the two electrodes with no tool wear, 
mechanical forces, or residual stresses by applying a consistent magnitude 
of potential between the tool electrode and the workpiece. The workpiece 
behaves as an anode (positive) and the tool electrode behaves as a cathode 
(negative) in electrochemical machining (ECM), and DC power is delivered 
between the tool electrode and the workpiece, enabling us to dissolve the 
anodic substance. 
12.1.1 Micro-Electrochemical Machining 
Micro-electrochemical machining is used in a variety of industrial areas, in-
cluding aerospace engineering, automotive engineering, and microelectronics. 
Micro-electrochemical machining would be used to create three-dimensional 
micro-structures such as micro-holes and micro-grooves. Figure 12.1 
In micro-electrochemical machining, the workpiece is secured in a frame 
and the tool is introduced into a tool post, and both are kept extremely 
close to each other so that the inter electrode gap (IEG) may be maintained. 
The inter electrode gap is the space between the tool and the workpiece. 
Following immersion of the tool and workpiece in an electrolyte solution 
(such as NaCl), a voltage difference across the tool and workpiece is ap-
plied, and material removal commences. 
12.1.2 Materials 
The Nimonic-263 alloy material was utilised in this experiment because it 
has strong corrosion resistance, high tensile strength, high temperature

resistance, and high yield strength. The Nomonic-263 alloy material has 
been utilised in the aerospace industry in aviation turbine engines for cas-
ings, rings, and fabrication sheets. Nimonic-263 alloy has a high heat 
conductivity. It has a high thermal ductility in welded constructions. 
Shunda Zhan et al. (2020) [2] The machining precision of the blade 
leading edge was enhanced by 41.79% by applying several machining 
parameters such as inlet/outlet pressure (0.30/0.08 MPa), applied voltage 
(20 V), feed speed (0.3 mm/min), and initial gap (0.5 mm). Feng Wang 
and colleagues.2020 [3] The surface quality of a rhombus hole could 
have been enhanced by using the synchronized electrochemical machining 
technique, and the radius of fillet and slope of sidewall were essentially 
lowered by raising the amplitude, which may increase the accuracy of the 
rhombus hole. With a feed rate of 0.4 mm/min, the surface quality has in-
creased. Thomas Bergs and colleagues.2020 [4] Conducted ECM is per-
formed on pure cementite material (Fe3c) using a tool material of 42CrMo4 
that is rotated at a speed of 20 to 40 m/s. In this research, two important 
machining factors (such as feed rate Vf and voltage U) were investigated, and 
the conclusion of an electrochemical machining process certificate was suc-
cessfully completed for the modification of the localised phase composition 
and surface grinding. Wenjian Cao and colleagues.2020 [5] Performed 
counter-rotating electrochemical machining (CRECM) to machine thin wall 
going to revolve parts, and the initial inter electrode gap decreased 
(0.272–0.158 mm) with increasing voltage (11–15 V), but continued to in-
crease after transitional period because comparative equilibrium MRR is 
greater than the corresponding feed rate. Guodong Liu.2020 [6] The group of 
researchers led by using sidewall insulating coatings on the electrode, it 
is possible to prevent stray corrosion and the sidewall slope of the machined 
structure has been lowered to 5.5 degrees by using nanofabrication 
photomasks to design all electrode forms and therefore influence dimension 
accuracy. Chen, X.L., and colleagues .2020 [7] A 20% duty cycle for jet 
flow−type pulses was shown to be more useful in reducing microgroove 
surface roughness when compared to other electrolyte flow patterns. Slit 
nozzle and standard deviation were operating with parameters such as 
temperature (250°C), frequency (2 kHz), duty cycle (20%, 40%, 60%, and 
80%) of the machining time (10 s), voltage (20, 15, 20, 25 V), and pressure 
(250 psi) (0.4 MPa). 
12.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
In order to carry out experiments on Nimonic-263 micro-ECM alloy, 
workpieces made of Nimonic-263 alloy of 1 cm x 1 cm have been employed 
in the experimental work. For micro-drilling, micro-electrochemical ma-
chining was utilised. Experiments have been conducted to study the impacts 
of various machining inputs, such as the applied voltage, feed rate, pulse 
Micro‐ECM of Nimonic 263 Alloy with ANN 217 

frequency, and electrolyte solution in order to generate micro-holes with a 
high-accuracy profile and acceptable surface quality. Table 12.1 displays 
the material’s elemental constituents. It was used for investigations in 
micro-electrochemical machining of nickel-based super alloy Nimonic-263. 
The Taguchi L16 orthogonal array method [8] was used to design the tests. 
There were four present levels for four different parameters. A micro-ECM 
method with the best-chosen parameters was used to make initial holes on 
Nimonic-263 alloy, which were subsequently machined independently 
utilising micro-ECM setups. After all of the tests, the best parameters for 
micro-drilling have been identified. Sodium nitrate (NaNO3) was the elec-
trolyte solution employed in this experiment, while copper was used as the 
tool electrode. Maximum voltage is 10 V, pulse frequencies are 5 KHz to 
150 KHz, and feed rates are 20–50/min. In order to conduct additional 
research, the average answer value has been obtained. There was a lot of 
attention paid to this experimental metric, the radial over cut (ROC). 
Taguchi’s L16 orthogonal array approach was utilised to examine the im-
pact of machining input parameters on response parameters like radial over 
cut in this experiment. 
It was necessary to choose inputs such as the voltage used, the pulse 
frequency, the electrolyte solution and the feed rate [8]. Four levels of factor 
classification are available to users. For several experiments, the electrolyte 
solution was regularly changed and refilled with new electrolyte solution.  
Table 12.2 lists the machine inputs that were chosen, along with the levels 
that were assigned to each one. The micro-holes were made using a sys-
tematic approach to compare productivity and accuracy, and significant

reaction was quantified as radial over cut. There are 16 orthogonal arrays 
(OA) in this experiment, which are shown in Table 12.3. 
12.3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
As an output parameter is affected by the parameter level, the signal-to- 
noise (S/N) ratio has been used to assess this impact. Using a sequence of 
16 tests, micro-ECM may be used to drill micro-holes. 
Table 12.3 shows the average radial overcut and Table 12.4 shows the 
S/N ratio of each output response. The best value for the factor is the one

ratios are shown in Table 12.4 (below). Data from the ROC (radial over 
cut) ANOVA is shown in Table 12.5. 
12.3.1 Radial Over Cut for Means 
The process machining effiency is evaluated by this response. Figure 12.2 
shows the primary effect chart: (applied voltage 7 V; electrolyte concentra-
tion 40 g/l; pulse frequency 100 KHz; feed rate 0.03 mm per minute) have 
been selected as the optimal input parameters. A1, B1, C3, and D2 are ex-
amples of the input parameters. 
Observing the radial over cut values, this graph shows the primary im-
pacts plot for means.

• The radial over cut values gradually climbed from 7 V to 8 V in the 
beginning; however, after 8 V the values significantly reduced. This is 
followed by a further 10 V rise in radial over cut. First, a minimal 
radial overcut is performed at a voltage of 7 V.  
• When the electrolyte concentration was raised from 40 g/l to 50 g/l, 
the radial over cut increased gradually, before sharply decreasing till 
60 g/l and then slightly rising.  
• Radial over cut increases sharply from pulse frequency of 100 KHz to 
125 KHz, which is the lowest at which radial overcut is allowed.  
• Radial over cut is reduced by 0.03 mm/min feed rate at the beginning 
of the graph. After then, the radial overcut is somewhat increased.

• There are radial over cut values at various factors, as seen in this 
graph of residual plots for means ratios.

cuts (Figure 12.4). The normal probability curve is shown as a single

direction on a graph. As shown by normal probability plots displaying 
the polynomial regression model, all data points are located within a 
few hundredths of a degree of the polynomial regression line.  
• Normal probability plots depict the radial overcut values between the 
typical percentage of probability and the residuals.  
• The radial over cut values between residuals and fitted values graphs 
are shown in the residuals vs. fits graph. A “residuals vs. fits plot” is 
the most used visual in a residual analysis. Residuals and fitted values 
are shown in this image, which shows non-linearity, mismatched error 
variances, and outliers.  
• In order to describe the radial over cut values, a histogram depicts the 
relationship between frequency and residuals. It is possible to utilise 
the residual histogram to determine whether or not the variance is 
uniformly distributed.  
• Inverse order plots show the relationship between residuals and the 
sequence in which observations were collected. The residual vs. ob-
servation order graph came into play to identify the mistake in the 
sequence that is near to each other, regardless of how the data were 
gathered in space.

is almost identical to the residual plot for means in that it represents all 
values. Figure 12.5 
12.4 PREDICTION OF RADIAL OVER CUT (ROC) VALUES  
USING AN ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK 
Based on the input parameters such as feed rate, electrolyte concentration, 
pulse frequency, and applied voltage, the radial over cut has been calculated 
at the time of machining of Nimonic-263 alloy. A multi-layer neural net-
work where two hidden layers were selected of 20 neurons each is added to 
predict the data. The ANN model has been trained by the Bayesian reg-
ulation of MATLAB. This regularization can handle improper data by 
solving the problems underfitting and overfitting. Table 12.6 shows the 
statistical data of radial over cut for ANN. 
12.4.1 Artificial Neural Network Model 
The artificial neural network used is shown in Figure 12.6: four input 
neurons viz feed rate, electrolyte concentration, pulse frequency, and 
applied voltage; also two hidden layers contain 20 neurons each (as per 
accuracy level) and finally, there is one output neurons (radial over cut). 
For training the data Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was used for better

results, further random data division, and for performance mean square 
error are used as parameters for ANN. According to the Figure 12.6, w 
and b are the assigned weights and biases for the neurons; further, the 
value of the radial over cut has been predicted by using a 4–20-20-1 
structure for cryogenic-treated CBN due to better accuracy. Figure 12.6 
shows the structure used in the model. 
Figure 12.7 reveals that the experimental runs 2, 3, 7, and 13 have dif-
ferent values compared to the predicted value of ANN. Further, experiment 
numbers 4, 6, 13, and 16 have higher radial over cut values. Figure 12.7 
shows the comparison between predicted values through ANN and ex-
perimental values for NC-CBN. 
Figure 12.8 shows a plot between mean square error (MSE) and six 
epochs non-cryogenic-treated CBN data set. In ANN, an epoch is one cycle

validation has occurred at one epoch, which means one cycle is im-

12.5 CONCLUSION 
As part of this research, the radial over cut was investigated using an ex-
perimental technique including machining input parameters, which included 
micro-drilling operations to create micro-holes in the Nimonic-263 alloy. 
Using a methodical approach, all of the data needed to plan and conduct tests 
was collected. The following findings are based on data from four stages of 
experimentation. Use of the Taguchi L16 orthogonal approach and artificial 
neural network model may be used to calculate the optimal process para-
meters and the expected data of a radial over cut and also detect the error 
between experimental values and anticipated values of a radial over cut.  
• The optimal parametric observations for meanings A1, B1, C3, and D2 
(applied voltage 7 V, electrolyte concentration 40 g/l, pulse frequency 
Figure 12.9 Regression plots through ANN of NC-CB for ROC.    
226 Evolutionary Optimization of Material Removal Processes 

100 KHz, and feed rate 0.03 mm/min) have been explored based on 
micro-ECM operations. 
• For SN ratios A1, B1, C3, and D2, the optimal parametric observa-
tion is based on the micro-ECM operation. 
• Applying voltage and feed rate are two of the most important char-
acteristics that affect the workpiece. 
• With these ideal conditions (applied voltage 7 V, electrolyte concentra-
tion 40 g/l, pulse frequency 100 KHz, and feed rate 0.03 mm/min), the 
least quantity of material is eliminated. The MINITAB programme has 
produced better outcomes in terms of the DOE approach.  
• Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been used to predict radial 
over cut values.  
• Because of its superior accuracy, the 4–20-20-1 structure has been 
used to forecast the radial over cut value for both cryogenically 
treated CBN samples.
