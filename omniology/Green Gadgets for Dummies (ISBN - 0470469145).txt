About the Author
Joe Hutsko lives in Ocean City, New Jersey and blogs about green gadgets 
for the Green Inc. section of the New York Times. For more than two decades, 
he has written about computers, gadgets, video games, trends, and high-
tech movers and shakers for numerous publications and Web sites, includ-
ing Macworld, PC World, Fortune, Newsweek, Popular Science, TV Guide, The 
Washington Post, Wired, Gamespot, MSNBC, and Salon.com. You can fi nd links 
to Joe’s stories on his tech blog, JOEyGADGET.com, and on his green gadgets 
blog, gGadget.org.
As a kid, Joe built a shortwave radio, played with electronic project kits, and 
learned the basics of the BASIC programming language on his fi rst computer, 
the Commodore Vic 20. In his teens, he picked strawberries to buy his fi rst 
Apple II computer. Four years after that purchase (in 1984), he wound up 
working for Apple, where he became the personal technology guru for the 
company’s chairman and CEO. Joe left Apple in 1988 to become a writer and 
worked on and off for other high-tech companies, including Steve Jobs’ one-
time NeXT. He authored a number of video game strategy guides, including 
the best sellers Donkey Kong Country Game Secrets: The Unauthorized Edition, 
and Rebel Assault: The Ofﬁ cial Insiders Guide.
Joe’s fi rst novel, The Deal, was published in 1999, and he recently rereleased 
a trade paperback edition of it with a new foreword by the author (tinyurl.

Dedication
This book is lovingly dedicated to my closest friend, considerate neighbor, 
and frequent dog walker and supper-supplying feeder, Frances Hutsko. Thank 
you, Mom, for being you.
Author’s Acknowledgments
This book wouldn’t have my name on its cover if my literary agent, Carole 
Jelen, hadn’t reached out on LinkedIn.com last summer to say hello after we 
had fallen out of contact since meeting in the 1980s, when I was working at 
Apple. Thank you, Carole, for pitching me to Wiley acquisition editor Amy 
Fandrei — and thank you, Amy, for saying yes!
Kudos to copy editor Rebecca Whitney for minding my words, grammatically 
speaking.
I’m enormously grateful to Tom Zeller, Jr., the editor of the Green. Inc. sec-
tion of the New York Times, for his insightful eye when helping me shape and 
edit my contributions on green gadgets. Special thanks to technology editor 
Damon Darlin, for making introductions — and for his fi rst-rate guidance on 
features I’ve written for the newspaper’s Personal Technology section.
Special thanks to the people and companies who provided the “greener” 
notebook computer loaners used to write this book, including Janette 
Barrios, Bill Evans, and Keri Walker of Apple; Jeffrey Witt of Lenovo; Kelly 
Odle of Gateway; and Debby Lee of ASUS.
Major thanks to every one of my ever-encouraging dear friends, especially 
Drew Davidson and Sue Godfrey, and to Ric Firmino, Katherine Etzel and 
Robert Pascale, David Unruh, David Baron, my cousin Chip McDermott, my 
brothers Steve and John, and my sister, Janice.
I’m deeply indebted to fi ve close friends, without whose generous support 
and faith this book could not have been written (literally!): Lisa Napoli, Linda 
Williams, Randee Mia Berman, Val Petrosian, and the person to whom this 
book is dedicated.
Last but not least, I’m hugely grateful for having the cosmically good fortune 
of being assigned to project editor Nicole Sholly, for her gently worded yet 
enormously intelligent guidance, brilliant organization, incisive editing, well-
honed instinct, and, above all, tremendous wit and generous sense of humor. 
Nicole, you were this fi rst-time For Dummies author’s dream-come-true-
editor as we worked together to turn what was initially a nightmarishly over-
whelming big-picture subject into 20 keenly focused, easy-to-understand 
chapters, from which I hope readers benefi t as much from reading as I did 
from writing them.

Green Gadgets For Dummies

Foreword
T
he very idea of “green gadgets,” to many, might seem an oxymoron. After 
all, it is a fundamental tenet of the environmental movement that less 
stuff is better, and that consumerism — the thing that makes us want to have 
that snazzy new cell phone, or to covet that nifty new digital camera — is at 
odds with maxims like “reduce, reuse, recycle.”
There’s some truth to this paradox — but it is hardly the only way to frame 
the contribution that technology can make to a greener, cleaner world. 
Setting aside the efforts underway to develop large-scale, clean-energy tech-
nologies like wind and solar power, which promise to address the steady 
march of climate change, there remain myriad ways for ordinary consumers 
to make simple adjustments in how they live — and what they buy — to 
generate substantial environmental gains.
In many cases, gadgets can help. Sure, we could all do better to manage our 
electricity consumption at home — but what if there were a product that 
could provide detailed data on when and where we were being most waste-
ful? What if there were “greener” versions of the technologies — like 
computers and cell phones — that we use frequently, and upgrade regularly?
Of course, such technologies do exist, and that’s part of what Joe Hutsko has 
assembled here: A guide to green gadgetry and how you can best deploy it to 
your own personal environmental advantage.
But this is not just a buying guide, and there’s a key point in that: Making 
better, less wasteful use of the gadgets you already own, and fi nding sensible 
ways to reduce, reuse and recycle those things you no longer need, are 
fi rst-order strategies for consumers seeking to limit their overall footprint.
So, too, is learning to understand the increasingly complex eco-friendly and 
energy-effi cent labeling systems used to keep consumers informed. You’ll 
fi nd guidance on these matters here as well.
There is no magic wand — no magic gadget — that will neutralize consumers’ 
impact on the planet. But I think few green advocates would quibble with the 
idea that every consumer can make simple, informed choices about the tech-
nologies they buy and the energy they use — and that these decisions, fac-
tored collectively, are an indispensable part of any environmental movement.

Introduction
I
f you’re in interested in finding out all about the latest environmentally 
and economically friendly gadgets and computers, if you want to use more 
efficiently the gadgets you already own, and if you want to know how to get 
rid of those gadgets in a responsible way, Green Gadgets For Dummies is the 
book for you.
Whether you’re reading this book to get greener with gadgets to help save 
the planet — or just to save some green in your wallet — one thing is certain: 
Reading this book can help you achieve both goals at the same time. But this 
book can’t cover everything there is to know about green gadgets the world 
over. Even the most ardent green gadget activist, thinker, blogger, designer, 
or enthusiast would be hard pressed to tell you everything there is to know 
about green gadgets. (There’s just that much to know.) Green Gadgets For 
Dummies, however, gives you a running start along a much greener path.
About Green Gadgets For Dummies
Technology moves at the speed of light, and although high-tech companies 
were comparatively slow to jump on the get-green bandwagon, they’re now 
falling all over each other in an effort to claim the title of World’s Greenest 
Company that created the World’s Greenest <insert gadget name here>.
I climbed aboard that get-green wagon 25 years ago as a household recycler 
when I lived in California. Though I’m a little older now, I’m also a lot wiser, 
but I’m as passionate as ever about finding, figuring out, using, and writing 
about green gadgets, gizmos, and high-tech gear. I’ve written this book to 
share that passion. Here are some of the things you can do with this book:
 
✓ Understand the role that gadgets play in affecting the environment
 
✓ Instantly take action to begin living a greener lifestyle with the gadgets 
and electronics you own
 
✓ Get a handle on green gadget factors to make the most energy-efficient 
choices possible when buying new mobile phones, computers, and other 
electronic devices

2
Green Gadgets For Dummies 
 
✓ Find ways to “do the right thing” by donating, gifting, trading, or selling 
working and useful but unwanted computers and other gadgets
 
✓ Properly dispose of broken or hopelessly useless gadgets and electron-
ics with the smallest impact on the planet
 
✓ Protect your identity by securely erasing your personal information 
from gadgets and computers before getting rid of them
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, I made a few assumptions about you, dear reader. To 
make sure we’re on the same page, I assume that
 
✓ You give a darn about the planet.
 
✓ You don’t think we should live in caves, but you do believe we should be 
conscious about how we use energy to power our gadgets.
 
✓ You know your way around your Web browser.
 
✓ You’re comfortable turning your gadgets and computers on and off, and 
you use them for the basic purposes for which they were intended.
 
✓ You want practical advice on making green gadget purchases and using 
the gadgets you own so as to save energy and a little money, too.
 
✓ You know that following that practical advice and saving energy will 
make a difference in the world but that you and your gadgets can’t 
(unfortunately) completely save it overnight.
 
✓ You understand that products used to illustrate green (or not-so-green) 
gadget qualities don’t constitute endorsements, unless otherwise explic-
itly stated, of said products and the companies that manufacture and 
sell them.
 
✓ You appreciate the speed at which technology-based products change, 
with newer, sleeker, better, faster models replacing previous versions 
in as little as a few months. (Which is to say, the products used to illus-
trate green gadget features, qualities, and behaviors might be replaced 
by newer models by the time you read this book.)
 
✓ You realize that it’s therefore up to you to go online to find updated 
information about the companies and products described throughout 
this book.

3
 Introduction
 
✓ You know that keeping up with the topic of green gadgets and green 
technologies and trends (even as a full-time job, as it is for me) still can’t 
make a guy the Ghandi of Green Gadgets. You will, accordingly, alert 
me to cool stuff you discover in your green gadget odyssey so that I can 
consider including it in the next edition of this book.
 
✓ You don’t expect general green living advice, especially because you can 
buy, or might already own, the best book on the subject — Green Living 
For Dummies, by Yvonne Jeffery, Liz Barclay, and Michael Grosvenor 
(Wiley Publishing).
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate this book as efficiently as the green gadgets it helps you 
get the most from, I use a few style conventions:
 
✓ Terms or words that I truly want to emphasize are italicized (and 
defined).
 
✓ Web site addresses, or URLs, are shown in a special monofont typeface, 
like this.
 
✓ Numbered steps that you need to follow and characters you need to 
type are set in bold.
What You Don’t Have to Read
You don’t have to read anything that doesn’t pertain to what you’re inter-
ested in. In fact, you can even skip a chapter entirely. I hope you don’t, 
though, because I believe that reading all chapters can make your overall 
reading experience more efficient and (dare I say it?) enjoyable.
As for sidebars you encounter throughout this book, feel free to ignore them 
because they contain, for the most part, tangential thoughts, miniature 
essays, or otherwise forgettable blathering that you’re just as likely to forget 
anyway after you read them. Ditto for any of the text you see alongside the 
Technical Stuff icon.

Green Gadgets For Dummies 
How This Book Is Organized
Because all For Dummies books are structured in a modular way, you’re free 
to remove your seatbelt and roam about this one in whatever way you like. 
Green Gadgets For Dummies is split into six parts, and the book’s table of con-
tents can help you find the topic you’re looking for. From there, you can go 
directly to the part, chapter, or section you’re interested in and skip all the 
rest. You’ll find no required reading here. In this section, however, I briefly 
describe which green-gadget-related information you’ll find in each part.
Part I: Settling into a 
Green Gadget Mindset
In this part, I explain what green gadgets are (and aren’t), describe the effect 
they can have on the planet, and tell you about the mostly good, though 
sometimes bad or ugly, effects they can have on the environment when 
they’re improperly disposed of. I also give you a bunch of instant-action tips 
and steps you can take to get greener with the gadgets, gizmos, and other 
consumer electronics devices you tote on your person or use in your home 
or at work.
Part II: Getting Green 
with Gadgets You Own
Making the most of the gadgets you already own by using them more effi-
ciently — and saving money by using less energy — is what it’s all about in 
Part II, Alfie. From tweaking your mobile phone settings to turning off fea-
tures you aren’t using, this part is where you can find out how to do your 
part in reducing the toll your gadgets take on the environment.
Part III: Minimizing Your Computer’s 
Carbon Footprint
Lowering your system’s consumption can shave as much as $75 from your 
yearly electricity expense. You don’t do it by using a screen saver to save 
energy (that’s the type of myth I debunk in this part), but you can make 
adjustments to your Windows or Mac computer’s power-saving settings to 
save energy for real. I also give you tips and tricks for reducing the number 
of energy-consuming things you connect to your computer, such as printers 
and mobile phones.

 Introduction
Part IV: Acquiring Green Gadgets 
and Gear
There’s no other way to say it, so I’ll just say it: Let’s go shopping! Maybe 
you’re looking for a super-efficient HDTV to replace that conked-out tube TV 
that finally gave up the ghost. Or, you might be in the market for the most 
environmentally friendly mobile phone (and wireless provider) money can 
buy. Chances are good that you’ll find what you’re looking for in these 
chapters.
Part V: Ridding Yourself of 
Gadgets the Green Way
You need to know all your options when the time comes to get rid of gadgets 
you no longer use. In this part, I cover organizations and take-back programs 
that can find grateful homes for your working but unwanted computer or 
mobile phone. I help you find the closest drop-off location for your fried note-
book, and I also describe the many ways to properly dispose of your digital 
stuff.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Here’s where things start out a little kooky — in a good way. The first two 
chapters in Part VI contain a total of 20 cool green gadgets. The first 10 are 
green add-ons and accessories for your computer. The items in the second 
set — with the exception of one — aren’t real products that you can acquire. 
Not yet, anyway. They represent the ten design finalists from the 2009 
Greener Gadgets Conference, which I attended a week before finishing this 
book. The last two chapters are where you’ll find ten green gadget buying 
tips and answers to ten frequently asked questions about green gadgets.
The companion Web site
Throughout this book, I provide several Web site URLs where you can go to 
find more information about companies, gadgets, and general green issues. 
To help you navigate to some of these places more easily, I have provided a 
list of links on the companion Web site. Just go to www.dummies.com/go/
greengadgetsfd and click the link for whatever site you want to peruse.

Green Gadgets For Dummies 
Icons Used in This Book
What’s a For Dummies book without icons pointing you in the direction of 
focused information that’s sure to help you along your way? The icons you 
encounter throughout Green Gadgets For Dummies are tiny road signs to 
attract or steer your attention to particularly useful information — or, in rare 
instances, potential trouble.
 
The Tip icon points out useful nuggets of information that can help you get 
things done more efficiently or direct you to something helpful that you might 
not know about.
 
When you spot this icon, it grabs your attention so that I don’t have to say 
something like “Remember: Unplug your cellphone charger when your phone 
is fully charged so that it doesn’t continue to draw and waste electricity.”
 
Danger, Will Robinson! When you see the Warning icon, you know to proceed 
with caution in regard to a topic, an issue, or a series of steps that it’s cozying 
up next to.
 
This icon highlights actions you can take — now or in the future — to make 
you an especially greener person.
 
Techie types, such as me, wouldn’t dream of missing these byte-size bits of 
nerdiness. Everyone else, feel free to skip them.
Where to Go from Here
If you want to know what defines a green gadget and how you can instantly 
take action on the ones you own, without a lot of preamble, Part I is the start-
ing point for you. If you’re looking to spend some green on a green smart-
phone, computer, or wind-up charger so that you can keep your gadgets alive 
when you hit that remote campground, by all means step right up to Part III. 
If you aren’t quite sure what your carbon footprint is, dive in at the beginning 
to wrap your brain around the basics, which can help you understand the 
sum of the other parts contained in all the other chapters that await you in 
Green Gadgets For Dummies.
Welcome to the world of green gadget living!

Part I
Settling into a 
Green Gadget 
Mindset

In this part . . .
U
nderstanding what makes a gadget green (or not so 
green) and how it affects the planet can give you a 
greater appreciation and confidence regarding your rela-
tionship with the gadgets in your life.
The first chapter in this part provides insight into how 
electronics products are manufactured, distributed, used, 
reused, and eventually recycled when they’re no longer 
useful — and how all those tasks affect the planet. You 
find that the three Rs of green gadgets — reduce, reuse, 
and recycle — join forces with a fourth: rethink.
The second chapter lists numerous ways you can instantly 
get greener with the gadgets you own by taking steps to 
decrease energy consumption while increasing savings. The 
chapter also includes ways to reuse, repurpose, and prop-
erly recycle the gadgets you want to get rid of.

Chapter 1
Mother Nature’s Green-Eyed 
View of Gadgets
In This Chapter
▶ Spelling out the meaning of green gadgets
▶ Understanding the effect of the three Rs — plus one — on the environment
▶ Discovering what makes the “greenest” gadgets green
▶ Getting acquainted with green gadget standards and ratings
▶ Calculating your gadgets’ carbon footprints and taking steps to reduce them
▶ Keeping up on green gadget news
T
his is Chapter 1, so I start the chapter from the green beginning, as it 
were, and describe exactly what green gadgets are. A green gadget is one 
that’s ecofriendlier, or greener, than products that have a greater negative 
impact on the environment in Mother Nature’s eyes. You might already know 
about the three Rs of the environment — reduce, reuse, recycle — but you 
might not know about a fourth R: rethink. I tell you how all four Rs relate to 
gadgets and their relationship with the planet.
I take you on a tour of the greenest notebook available (at the time I wrote 
this book), to illustrate exactly how green gadget factors look and feel in 
terms of a product you can hold in your hands. I also show you a couple of 
other notably greener gadgets, explain the role that your existing gadgets 
play in the big-planet picture, and show you how you can calculate your gad-
gets’ energy consumption to figure out — and reduce — their contribution to 
the carbon footprint you generate by using them.
Finally, I introduce you to the terms and green labels you should look for 
when shopping for new greener gadgets, and I explain what each one means.

Part I: Settling into a Green Gadget Mindset 
Hey, Joe, Where You Goin’ with That 
Green Gadget in Your Hand?
Green gadget? What green gadget?
Do you mean the silver aluminum notebook I’m typing this chapter on, which 
Apple calls its “greenest MacBook ever?”
Or, do you mean the black, solar-powered Iqua SUN Bluetooth headset, stuck 
in my ear, that charged itself in the morning sunlight as I walked my dog, 
Nick, on the beach and answered a call from my mom?
Maybe you’re referring to The Energy Detective (TED) sitting on my kitchen 
counter. It displays in real-time exactly how much electricity my house is 
consuming in kilowatts — and in dollars and cents. Is that the green gadget 
you’re talking about? (I probably should mention that The Energy Detective 
is housed in white plastic.)
Ohhh, now I get you. You mean that green gadget — the big, round, pulsat-
ing ecobutton, sitting next to my Eee PC 1000HE, that with a single touch can 
instantly make the mini-notebook go to sleep by switching it to ecofriendlier 
Suspend mode. And yes, although the photo of the gadget in Figure 1-1 is in 
black and white, I can attest to the fact that the ecobutton’s base is green 
and the pulsating lights inside are absolutely, positively, 100 percent green-
green-green or my name isn’t Joe.
A disclaimer
You know that voice that talks really fast at the end of a drug commercial? It’s the one that says 
“talk to your doctor first” or “your mileage may vary.” Herewith, my own speedy disclaimer of sorts 
(read as quickly as possible to simulate the full end-of-the-commercial effect):
 
 “All mobile phones, PDAs, desktop computers, notebooks, TVs, and other gadgets described 
in this chapter and throughout this book were chosen to illustrate unique, greener-computing 
innovations and advances and are not meant to represent your only green choices, nor does 
their inclusion here represent an endorsement of one particular brand or model over others 
that aren’t covered in these pages.”

11
 Chapter 1: Mother Nature’s Green-Eyed View of Gadgets
 
Figure 1-1: 
A snooze 
button to 
put your 
computer to 
sleep.
 
But my name would be Pinocchio if I told you that the ecobutton is, in spite 
of its green color and light, a green gadget.
It’s not.
Neither is the MacBook, a solar Bluetooth headset, or a home energy 
monitor.
But all four represent considerably ecofriendlier, or greener, gadgets (what I 
refer to simply as green gadgets throughout the book) than products that are 
less sensitive to the planet.
So what is a green gadget?
Nothing. Because there’s no such thing.
Wait! Before you double-check this book’s cover to make sure that you’re 
reading the book you thought you were reading (assuming that you didn’t 
fling it across the room), let me explain what I mean.
Before I do, however, I want to take a bigger-picture view of how the gadgets 
and electronics in your life affect the planet in a number of ways, as calcu-
lated by the article “How to Go Green: Home Electronics” at The Discovery 
Channel Planet Green site (http://planetgreen.discovery.com/
go-green/home-electronics):

12
Part I: Settling into a Green Gadget Mindset 
 
✓ 15 percent: The percentage of money spent on powering computers 
worldwide; the rest of the $250 billion is spent on energy wasted from 
idling.
 
✓ 70 percent: The percentage of all hazardous waste that’s composed of 
discarded electronics.
 
✓ 529 pounds: The amount of fossil fuels needed to manufacture a 
53-pound computer system (including the monitor), along with 49 
pounds of chemicals and 1.5 tons of water.
 
✓ 15 billion: The number of batteries produced annually worldwide.
 
✓ 40 percent: The percentage of energy used for electronics in your home 
while the devices are turned off.
 
✓ 1 billion: The number of kilowatt hours of power each year that can be 
saved by using energy-efficient battery chargers in the United States. 
This in turn would save more than $100 million each year and prevent 
the release of more than a million tons of greenhouse gases.
Assessing “green” companies
Just because a company says that it and its products are green doesn’t 
necessarily make them so, as I explain further in Chapter 9, the chapter 
that dispels the myths of greenwash hype. In a 2008 Consumer Electronics 
Association (CEA) survey, 74 percent of consumers polled said that com-
panies should do more to protect the environment. Yet only 17 percent of 
consumers said they felt familiar with the policies and reputations of compa-
nies that manufacture consumer electronics. What’s more, more than half of 
the people polled said they felt that companies overstate the environmental 
friendliness of their products in order to sell more of them.
To quote the environmental organization Greenpeace (http://greenpeace.
org/electronics) about the findings of its 2008 Green Electronics Survey, 
it found “no products that could claim the title of a truly green product.”
However, both Greenpeace and the CEA report that companies manufactur-
ing gadgets are increasingly eliminating toxic chemicals from their products 
while making them more energy-efficient and easier to recycle.
Here are some of the choice nuggets uncovered by the 2008 Greenpeace 
survey:
 
✓ Manufacturers continue to phase out the use of hazardous chemicals, 
and more products are PVC-free than in the previous year’s findings. 
Notebooks that use LED-type LCD displays that draw less power and are 
free of mercury are becoming more popular.

13
 Chapter 1: Mother Nature’s Green-Eyed View of Gadgets
 
✓ Larger consumer electronics, such as TVs and computer monitors, are 
being manufactured with significant amounts of postconsumer recy-
cled plastic. Most mobile phones and desktop and notebook computers, 
however, are lagging in this regard.
 
✓ Manufacturers have adapted quickly to new Energy Star require-
ments. Even so, a small number of products that Greenpeace evaluated 
don’t yet meet the most recent Energy Star specifications.
 
✓ More manufacturers track the amount of energy used to produce their 
electronic products. Without an international standard (none currently 
exists) for comparing how the products stack up against each other, this 
information means little to consumers.
 
✓ Computer manufacturers are more forthcoming with in-use power 
consumption data and comparisons for their products. Monitor and TV 
manufacturers are lagging behind in this area.
 
✓ Many companies have special “green” sections on their Web sites. 
These sections are meant to help consumers learn about a company’s 
ecofriendly features and benefits. That’s a good thing, but most of these 
green sections weren’t prominently advertised to promote greener elec-
tronic products as major purchasing decisions.
The survey assessed more than 50 consumer electronics products, scoring 
each on a number of factors. With a maximum of 100 attainable points, the 
total points for each product in the survey was adjusted to a possible top 
score of 10. (See Chapter 9 for more about the survey results.)
Of all products that were evaluated (desktop computers, notebook comput-
ers, mobile phones, smartphones, PDAs, televisions, and computer moni-
tors), the highest-ranking product was the Lenovo L2440 wide display, shown 
in Figure 1-2, which scored 6.90 points.
The Acer TravelMate 6293 notebook landed at the bottom of the scale with 
a score of 3.44, and topping the category was the Toshiba Portégé R600. I 
introduce you to the Portégé in the later section “Following a Green Gadget’s 
Carbon Footprint.”
 
Although you can see that no single absolutely, positively, 100 percent super-
green gadget exists, increasingly greener mobile phones, notebook computers, 
wireless network routers, Blu-ray DVD players, high-definition TVs (HDTVs), 
and other consumer electronics products do exist. That’s what I talk about in 
this book.

Defining gadgets
You may want to ask, “Since when, Mr. Green Gadgets For Dummies, is some-
thing that’s too big to fit in my pocket — such as a humongous high-def TV — 
considered a gadget, green or otherwise?”
Well, it’s not.
Okay, an HDTV isn’t a gadget per se, but it incorporates many elements that 
gadgets such as mobile phones and MP3 players have — for example, inte-
grated circuits, speakers, and liquid crystal displays (LCD), albeit on a gigan-
tically bigger, and wider scale.

15
 Chapter 1: Mother Nature’s Green-Eyed View of Gadgets
At the annual Greener Gadgets Conference (http://greenergadgets.
com), see Figure 1-3, people gather to learn about and discuss the environ-
mental impact of manufacturing, distributing, efficiently using, reusing, and 
properly recycling consumer electronics. It’s fair to say that in this book, the 
term green gadgets is all-encompassing. Besides, doesn’t this book’s title have 
a nicer ring than Green Consumer Electronics For Dummies?
 
Figure 1-3:

Defining green gadgets
Just to be sure that we’re on the same page, let me say that green gadgets are 
consumer electronic products that strive to be ecofriendlier. They have a few 
or all of these characteristics:
 
✓ They contain little or no toxic chemicals or materials.
 
✓ They are manufactured as efficiently as possible, using the fewest mate-
rials possible, by companies that practice environmentally friendlier 
policies and processes.
 
✓ They are built with highly recyclable materials, such as aluminum, arse-
nic-free glass, or recycled plastic bottles, for as many parts as possible.
 
✓ They draw as little power as possible — and uses that energy as effi-
ciently as possible.
 
✓ They can power down to Standby mode or shut off (and shut off other 
gadgets that are plugged into them) if they detect that you aren’t using 
them or after a certain amount of time has passed.
 
✓ They use a rechargeable battery pack, or batteries, rather than dispos-
able ones.

16
Part I: Settling into a Green Gadget Mindset 
 
✓ They can be recharged (or can recharge other gadgets) from sources 
other than electricity, such as by absorbing sunlight with solar panels or 
by winding a crank to generate power.
 
✓ They can help you save gas and produce fewer carbon emissions by 
plotting the most efficient route to your destination or by monitoring 
and analyzing your driving style and then offering tips to help you drive 
more efficiently.
 
✓ They are packaged as efficiently as possible in packaging made of par-
tially to 100 percent recycled materials.
 
✓ They can be easily recycled — ideally through hassle-free take-back or 
trade-in programs offered by the manufacturer.
Relating the Four Rs to Green Gadgets
Most people are probably familiar with the eco-aware mantra known as the 
three Rs of green gadgets: Reduce, reuse, recycle. I now introduce you to 
what the Consumer Electronics Association Web site at MyGreenElectronics.
org refers to as the fourth R — rethink — to help you make green gadget pur-
chases. I discuss the four Rs in detail in Chapter 2, but this list sums them up:
 
✓ Reduce: Less is more. Using less energy by turning off gadgets and 
devices when you aren’t using them, as well as adjusting their power set-
tings to run more efficiently when they’re on, can provide more savings 
in both kilowatts and in the amount of money you pay for them.
 
✓ Reuse: If it ain’t broke, don’t nix it. Refilling your printer’s inkjet or laser 
toner cartridges, donating to charity an older but still usable mobile 
phone, or upgrading an older PC with faster components rather than 
buying a new computer are all examples of applying the second R to the 
gadgets in your life.
 
✓ Recycle: This R can make more of a difference to the planet than any 
of the others. Every year, hundreds of thousands of old or broken 
computers and cellphones wind up in landfills or incinerators. Tossing 
unwanted or broken electronics into town or city municipal trash collec-
tion streams is ignorant, irresponsible, lazy, and offensive. It can even 
be potentially life threatening if the discarded digital items wind up in an 
incinerator, where they eventually reach the air we breathe, or in a land-
fill, where they break down and seep into the ground and contaminate 
the water we drink.

17
 Chapter 1: Mother Nature’s Green-Eyed View of Gadgets
 
 Adding to the problem are the thousands more discarded electron-
ics that wind up as electronic waste, or e-waste, that are often illegally 
exported to Asia from the U.S. and other industrialized countries. 
The e-waste wind up in scrap yards that expose workers to toxic chemi-
cals and poisons.
 
✓ Rethink: To help minimize the disastrous long-term effects of e-waste, 
picture the life cycles of future purchases all the way to the recycling 
bin. Consider this: In a 2008 survey conducted by the CEA, nearly 90 
percent of consumers said energy efficiency will be a determining factor 
in choosing and purchasing their next televisions. Yet less than half of 
the people polled said that they understand the ecofriendlier attributes 
associated with consumer electronics and gadgets.
How do some or all of these factors tie together cleaner-living, cleaner-
breathing green gadgets in the real world? Let me show you.
Following a Green Gadget’s 
Carbon Footprint
Visualizing how a gadget’s carbon footprint affects the environment is easier 
to understand by taking a closer look at how a real product that you can hold 
in your hand relates to the four Rs as it moves from the stage of raw materi-
als and components to being
 
✓ Manufactured and packaged in a factory
 
✓ Shipped to resellers or directly to you, the consumer
 
✓ Used by the consumer
 
✓ Given away or repurposed by the consumer
 
✓ Discarded by you or someone you gave it to
 
✓ Recycled
So that you can follow a gadget’s carbon footprint, I take you on a guided 
tour of the Toshiba Portégé R600 ultralight notebook computer, shown in 
Figure 1-4. This notebook earned the coveted title of Greenest Notebook in 
the 2008 Greenpeace Green Electronics Survey.

18
Part I: Settling into a Green Gadget Mindset 
 
Figure 1-4: 
The Toshiba 
Portégé 
R600.
 
Toshiba’s “green procurement” initiative in all aspects of the Portégé series 
development means that the company works in collaboration with compo-
nent and parts suppliers to help it achieve its targeted carbon footprint — a 
term I define in the following sidebar, “Sticking your carbon footprint in your 
mouth,” in case you’re not exactly sure what it stands for.
What’s more, the factory in which the Portégé series is manufactured recov-
ers and recycles waste generated during the manufacturing process, includ-
ing silver, copper, and tin.
To quote Greenpeace, “Toshiba is ahead of everyone else when it comes to 
the elimination of toxic chemicals.”
To browse a fuller menu of unappetizing hazardous chemical substances and 
find out why they’re so upsetting to the planet’s stomach (and ours), check 
out the Chapter 16 sidebar “An e-waste recipe for disaster.”
Thoughtful manufacturing
Beginning with the raw materials that go into giving “birth” to the notebook, 
Toshiba lessens the carbon footprint of the Portégé R600 during the manufac-
turing process by eliminating hazardous substances — including cadmium, 
mercury, and lead from batteries and other components. The elimination of 
those substances directly affects the notebook’s carbon footprint and impact 
on the planet when the notebook “dies” and is recycled at the end of its 
lifecycle.
Choices like the ones in the following list reduce a gadget’s carbon footprint 
before it reaches your hands and you then use it:

19
 Chapter 1: Mother Nature’s Green-Eyed View of Gadgets
 
✓ The R600 LED-type LCD display helps eliminate additional mercury. 
More and more computer makers are offering this type of mercury-free 
display in their products. Less mercury means less potential harm to the 
environment when the display reaches its end of life and is broken down 
and disposed of or recycled.
 
✓ The notebook is packaged in the smallest (yet still protective) box. 
Smaller packaging means that more boxes can be packed into fewer 
shipping containers.
 
✓ The entire unit is packed in antishock cushioning made from partially 
or completely recycled materials. Using recycled materials in the pack-
aging translates to fewer new resources taken from the planet to box the 
computer. It also means that the packaging can be more easily broken 
down and recycled, either after receiving the computer or by someone 
you later give the computer to.
In addition to the Greenpeace assessment, the R600 ranks high in other green 
terms, including its
 
✓ Energy Star 4.0 compliance
 
✓ Number-one ranking in the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment 
Tool (EPEAT) Gold category (at the time this book was written)
 
✓ Compliance with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive 
(RoHS)
These kudos translate to better energy efficiency when you use a notebook 
like the R600, which means a further reduction of its carbon footprint’s 
impact on the environment throughout its usable lifecycle.
In the later section “Understanding Energy Star and EPEAT Green Gadget 
Labels,” I explain these and other assessment standards or ratings to look for 
when considering new gadget purchases.
Ecofriendly features
The following list describes some of the other green features that help lessen 
the carbon footprint of the R600 and its impact on the environment:
 
✓ Thin, lightweight (2.4 lb) design: This translates to less stress when lug-
ging it in your shoulder bag and less resources taken from the planet.
 
✓ Rechargeable battery: The battery can last more than 71/2 hours. Finally, 
you can leave the charger at home!

20
Part I: Settling into a Green Gadget Mindset 
 
✓ Transreflective display: You can see and use the display outdoors with 
the backlight turned off. Who says that a park bench isn’t a truly greener 
home office?
 
✓ Solid-state drive (SSD) option: Say goodbye to moving parts and typical 
hard drive crashes. Think of it as the same kind of memory that’s in your 
mobile phone.
The R600 also boasts James Bond-like features, such as a fingerprint scanner 
for securing your identity and passwords, as shown in Figure 1-5, and a built-
in webcam with face recognition for added protection. Okay, these features 
aren’t exactly green, but they sure are cool — say “Cheese!”

Other green electronics
The following list describes three more green consumer electronics products 
that illustrate what Greenpeace calls “the race to the top to produce truly 
green products”:
 
✓ Samsung solar-powered Blue Earth mobile phone: Designed to look like 
a flat, well-rounded, shiny pebble, it’s the world’s first solar-powered 
touch-screen phone. A solar panel on the back of the phone can gener-
ate enough power to make calls and charge the battery.

21
 Chapter 1: Mother Nature’s Green-Eyed View of Gadgets
 
 The gadget is made from recycled plastic extracted from water bottles, 
and both the phone and its charger — which draws fewer than 0.03 
watts after it charges the phone — are free from toxic substances, 
including brominated flame retardants (BFRs), beryllium, and phtha-
lates.
 
 The Eco mode feature adjusts the brightness, backlight duration, and 
Bluetooth energy efficiency settings — they’re a single touch away. The 
Eco Walk function counts your steps with a built-in pedometer and cal-
culates how much CO2 emissions have been reduced by hoofing it rather 
than driving.
 
✓ HYmini wind-powered charger: Cranking or winding rechargers turns 
your energy into power you can use to charge your gadgets. Relying on 
the wind, rather than on you, is how the HYMini wind-powered charger 
(at www.hymini.com) generates power to juice up your MP3 player, 
digital camera, mobile phone, and other gadgets.
Sticking your carbon footprint in your mouth
It’s a term that rolls off tongues whenever 
there’s talk about the environment and being 
green, as pervasively present in print, radio, and 
TV advertisements as fleas on a junkyard dog 
(for which I don’t blame the dog, mind you). It’s 
a phrase that I personally bandy about in every 
chapter of this book: carbon footprint.
Knowing what the term carbon footprint means 
can help you gain a better appreciation of why 
it matters so much to Mother Nature and the 
planet she oversees, and on which she must 
wish we would responsibly dwell. Simply 
put, a carbon footprint is the total amount 
of carbon dioxide (CO2) — or greenhouse 
gases — produced by humans as we live our 
lives. For instance, when you drive to the store 
to pick up some ecofriendly dish soap, your 
car’s engine burns gasoline, which in turn 
produces CO2 emissions from the muffler and 
into the air. More efficient cars produce fewer 
emissions than gas guzzlers, whereas walk-
ing or riding your bike instead produces none. 
And, although your bicycle or walking shoes 
don’t contribute to your carbon footprint when 
you’re using them, the mining and harvesting of 
materials for manufacturing, and the manufac-
turing process itself, play a part in increasing 
the world’s greenhouse gases.
Manufacturing, packaging, shipping, shelv-
ing, buying, using, maintaining, and eventually 
disposing of gadgets all contribute to the total 
carbon footprint over the life of the product. 
Adding each of your gadget’s individual carbon 
footprints to the others in your life that you gen-
erate — when you drive, fly to on an airplane, 
ride the roller coaster at an amusement park, 
flush the toilet, make coffee, pray in church 
or a nondenominational meeting hall, and rest 
your head on a pillow and curl up with a paper-
back thriller at the end of the day — total the 
personal carbon footprint, which doesn’t stop 
growing until the day you die.
Come to think of it, your carbon footprint doesn’t 
quite come to a complete halt when you die, 
because firing up a crematorium or digging 
your grave and conducting your funeral ser-
vice — not to mention all the travel and energy 
expended by those who attend — all contribute 
to your grand-total carbon footprint after all is 
said and done (so to speak).

 What, no wind today? No worries. Connect the HYMini to your bicycle’s 
handlebars or strap it to your upper arm with optional accessories and 
start peddling or running to make a little wind as you go about your 
merry, ecofriendlier way.
 
✓ Sony Bravia VE5: Sensing when you’re no longer in the room and watch-
ing, the Sony Bravia VE5 Series (www.sonystyle.com) can turn itself 
off to save energy. Come back in, and the HDTV turns itself on again. 
Sony says that the set draws 40 percent less power than other LCD 
models — and almost zero watts when it’s powered off in Standby mode. 
What’s more, a light sensor can automatically adjust the picture bright-
ness to match the room’s “mood,” drawing even less energy when the 
lights go down and it’s time to start the show.
Understanding Energy Star and 
EPEAT Green Gadget Labels
Energy Star defines energy efficiency standards for a variety of products 
and services and qualifies specific products that meet those standards. The 
EPEAT system helps buyers evaluate, compare, and select desktop com-
puters, laptops, and monitors based on their environmental attributes. All 
EPEAT-registered products are automatically Energy Star qualified. You can 
find more information by visiting these Web sites:
 
✓ Energy Star: Consumers can use the Energy Star standards to shop for 
products and services that meet those standards. See www.energy
star.gov. For instance, computers bearing the Energy Star logo must, 
at a minimum, offer three distinct operating modes — Standby, Active, 
and Sleep — to ensure energy savings when computers are being used, 
as well as when they’re in Standby or Sleep mode. Energy Star-approved 
computers must also use more efficient internal power supplies.
 
✓ EPEAT: This system, at http://epeat.net, helps purchasers 
evaluate, compare, and select desktop computers, laptops, and moni-
tors based on their environmental attributes. As I describe earlier in 
“Following a Green Gadget’s Carbon Footprint,” Toshiba’s Portégé R600 
was ranked the “Greenest Notebook” by Greenpeace because of EPEAT 
criteria it met, such as these: 
 
• Is made from green materials
 
• Is highly recyclable
 
• Is energy efficient 
 
• Is packaged using a minimum of recycled (and recyclable) 
materials

23
 Chapter 1: Mother Nature’s Green-Eyed View of Gadgets
 
✓ Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS): This European directive 
restricts the use of six hazardous materials in the manufacturing of elec-
tronics. Banned from the EU market are new electrical and electronic 
equipment containing more than agreed-upon levels of lead, cadmium, 
mercury, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) and 
polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants. Check out 
www.rohs.gov.uk.
Initially, computers and monitors (the worst offenders) were the first prod-
ucts to wear the Energy Star logo. Since partnering with the Department of 
Energy in 1996 for additional product categories, the label can now be found 
on everything from major appliances and office equipment to DVD players 
and set-top cable TV boxes.
  
Earning one of the three EPEAT ratings is sort of like winning an Olympic 
medal — which is exactly how the three levels of accomplishment are named:
 
✓ Bronze: Products meet all required criteria.
 
✓ Silver: Products meet all required criteria plus 50 percent of optional 
criteria.
 
✓ Gold: Products meet all required criteria plus 75 percent of optional 
criteria.
  
Here are a few fun facts provided by the CEA about the badges of green 
gadget ecoconsciousness awarded by Energy Star and EPEAT:
 
✓ Sales of Energy Star televisions, monitors, audio, and video products in 
the U.S. reached nearly 35 million units in 2006.

24
Part I: Settling into a Green Gadget Mindset 
 
✓ Seven million of those products were sold by Best Buy, which, according 
to EPA calculations:
 
• Saved consumers $100 million dollars on their utility bills
 
• Eliminated 1.4 billion pounds of carbon emissions — or the equiva-
lent of removing 128,000 cars from the road
 
✓ The savings gained from purchases of EPEAT-certified products in 2007 
equaled
 
• 75.5 million metric tons of primary materials — equivalent to the 
weight of more than 585 million refrigerators
 
• 3,220 metric tons of toxic materials, which equal a stack of 1.6 mil-
lion bricks
 
• 42.2 billion kilowatt-hours, which is enough energy to power 3.7 
million U.S. homes for an entire year
Implementing Green Living Habits 
with Gadgets You Already Own
Thinking about past purchases that may not have been labeled as greener 
when you bought them plays just as important a role in Mother Nature’s view 
of gadgets as choosing and using new greener gadgets in your future.
Getting into a greener gadget lifestyle can be as simple as making a few 
changes to the electronics in your life or as complex as installing a home 
control system that can monitor and remotely or automatically operate every 
powered item in your house, from automatically turning lights on and off to 
regulating the climate to save energy when you aren’t home.
Taking a bite out of “energy vampires”
Forty percent of the energy used for electronics in your home is consumed 
while devices known as energy vampires are turned off. They suck power the 
way the eponymous mythical creatures suck blood. But energy vampires are 
no myth. You don’t need garlic or a stake to fight energy vampires, though, 
because these simple actions can be your weapons:
 
✓ Unplug your mobile phone’s charger.
 
✓ Turn off your computer monitor or set it to shut off itself and the com-
puter after you haven’t used it for a few minutes.

25
 Chapter 1: Mother Nature’s Green-Eyed View of Gadgets
 
✓ Program your thermostat to turn up the heat or cool things down only 
when you’re in the house.
You can do all these tasks immediately to reduce energy consumption and 
extend the life of your gadgets. Cutting off several energy vampire gadgets 
can be a heck of lot easier when you plug them into a smart power strip, one 
that cuts the power when your devices are turned off.
My favorite is the Belkin Conserve because its remote control lets you 
instantly shut off eight of its outlets all at one time while leaving two on 
all the time. I can use the Conserve to reduce the amount of energy being 
wasted by my Xbox 360, HDTV, Vudu movie box, notebook computer, mobile 
phone and PlayStation Portable rechargers, and laser printer. Plugging 
devices that are on all the time, such as my Wi-Fi router and cable broadband 
modem, into the pair of always-on outlets means that I can surf the Web and 
take care of my e-mail on the sofa. To further reduce my gadgets’ total carbon 
footprint, I can plug the Conserve power strip into a wall outlet timer that 
cuts the juice at bedtime every night and then turns it back on just before my 
usual waking time of 6:30 a.m.
Calculating your gadgets’ 
carbon footprints
You can gauge your gadgets’ individual power consumption by plugging 
them into products that feed useful information back to you. The Kill A Watt 
energy monitor monitors individual gadgets, or you can monitor your entire 
home’s energy consumption with a product such as The Energy Detective 
(TED), shown in Figure 1-6. Using one of these products can help you better 
understand — and reduce — your gadgets’ carbon footprints.

✓ Adjust your computer’s power-saving settings to turn off the monitor 
when you’re away for more than a few minutes, and then switch the 
PC to either Standby or Hibernate mode if you haven’t returned a little 
while later. Part III covers just about anything you can do to reduce your 
computer’s carbon footprint.
Staying Informed about Green 
Gadget Developments
No single source can tell you everything there is to know about green 
gadgets — not even this book!
By visiting Web sites and blogs that cover the topic of green gadgets, or that 
have sections that cover them, you can
 
✓ Find out about the latest ecofriendly efforts and products being made by 
consumer electronics companies.
 
✓ Read reviews and features of those products so that you can make more 
informed purchase decisions.
 
✓ Find out how to get the most from the gadgets and gear you already 
own.
 
✓ Communicate with other people who are also interested in living a green 
gadget lifestyle.
I include, on the Cheat Sheet in the front of this book, ten useful Web sites 
focused on green gadgets and environmentally friendly technologies. Don’t

Chapter 2
Practicing Green Gadget Living
In This Chapter
▶ Taking stock of how much energy you use
▶ Turning off gadgets to reduce their carbon footprints
▶ Giving your gadgets and gear another go-round
▶ Recycling your unwanted or useless gadgets
▶ Weighing whether to make new gadget purchases
▶ Relating ecofriendly electronics concepts to others
A
 green-gadget lifestyle should be pursued incrementally. You implement 
a few green practices to start out, and then as they become part of your 
routine, you implement a few more. I predict that the more you do, the more 
you’ll be motivated to do. But where do you begin? In this chapter, I show 
you that evaluating how much energy you use (and how much you unwit-
tingly waste) will likely be an eye-opening experience. It’s a vital first step.
Knowing how you use your gadgets might then motivate you to take steps to 
apply the standard “three Rs” of green living — reduce, reuse, and recycle. 
In this chapter, however, I expand on the concept of the fourth R, which I 
mention in Chapter 1, and tell you how to rethink the way you view gadgets. 
Rethinking applies to how you use gadgets you own, how you shop for new 
ones, and how you dispose of those that you no longer want or need. The 
sections in this chapter briefly describe the philosophy behind each R and 
present a quick list of practices for each one.
Understanding your energy usage also plays an important role in helping you 
make more informed choices when you acquire new, ecofriendly gadgets. If 
you’re like me, you want to spread the word about greener gadget living, so 
I wrap up this chapter by giving you some tips on sharing your gadget 
greenness.

30
Part I: Settling into a Green Gadget Mindset 
Evaluating Your Energy Waste, er, Usage
When it comes to your gadgets, the single most important issue to consider 
isn’t how much or how little energy they use or waste, but rather how much 
you do. A gadget, whether it’s the latest and most energy efficient or it’s 
many years old and inefficient, uses energy only when you use it — and, as I 
say in Chapter 1, even when you don’t use it. Most gadgets, new and old alike, 
continue to draw power when they’re turned off but remain in Standby mode. 
Turning off your TV, for instance, cuts most, but not all, of the power it draws 
as it stands by, ready to display the picture when you turn it on more quickly 
than if you had unplugged the power cord to completely cut its power draw. 
I refer to TVs and gadgets in Standby mode as energy vampires. Even a fully 
recharged mobile phone that you power off but leave plugged in the wall 
charger is an energy vampire. That’s because most portable gadget chargers 
continue to draw power even after the gadgets they’re charging have done 
their jobs.
Mobile phone and other gadget manufacturers are working on or have begun 
offering green phones and chargers that draw nearly zero power after they 
sense that the phone is charged. For instance, certain new Nokia phone 
models alert you when the phone is charged and then remind you to unplug 
the charger from the wall. And, a new line of high-definition TVs (HDTVs) 
from Sony draws only a tiny amount of power when they’re turned off.
Although these undeniably positive moves promise that the new gadgets you 
purchase will be more ecofriendly than the ones you’re replacing, remem-
bering to apply greener decisions to the ones you’re still using is a matter of 
appreciating how much energy you’re using to power them.
Taking stock of how much energy you use, or waste, to power your gadgets 
can shed a powerfully motivating new light on actions you can take to start 
practicing a greener gadget lifestyle.
To practice what I preach in this section, I evaluated my own energy con-
sumption by taking stock of the gadgets I typically use every day:
 
✓ At least one notebook computer, and sometimes as many as three when 
I’m writing about multiple operating systems (Macintosh, Linux, and 
Windows 7, Vista, or XP)
 
✓ A wireless mouse (or two)
 
✓ A mobile phone and Bluetooth headset
 
✓ A printer that’s typically in energy-saving Standby mode because I print 
so infrequently
 
✓ An iPod nano on the days I go for a run
 
✓ A wireless network router and a broadband modem

31
 Chapter 2: Practicing Green Gadget Living
 
✓ A TiVo digital video recorder (DVR) to record a few hours of news, 
which I watch while cooking supper and catching up on e-mail at the end 
of the workday
 
✓ An HDTV to watch the news and then to play a video game or watch a 
movie using one of my three movie download or streaming devices
 
✓ A universal remote control that controls the HDTV and devices plugged 
into it, like the TiVo, and my Apple TV music and movie player
 
✓ A rechargeable battery charger on days I need to recharge batteries for 
my electric beard trimmer or booklight — which count as three devices
 
✓ Assorted devices (and chargers that recharge many of the gadgets and 
gizmos in this list and others that I use only now and then), such as my 
AppleTV, Nintendo DS, Nintendo Wii, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, 
and even more, which are piled in boxes
 
To find out how much energy all my devices and gadgets were consuming — and 
contributing to the carbon footprint I’m creating by using them — I decided to 
do some investigating. What I discovered was unsurprising yet so eye-opening 
that it motivated me to take additional actions beyond those I was already 
taking to live an even greener gadget lifestyle.
I investigated my energy use by using The Energy Detective (TED) power 
monitor. I can use it to instantly monitor exactly how many kilowatts I’m 
burning — and what they’re costing me today and by the month. You can 
read about The Energy Detective, shown in Figure 2-1, and how I installed it 
in my house in Chapter 13.
 
Figure 2-1: 
The Energy 
Detective.
 
As I write this chapter, the devices in my household are drawing .850 kilo-
watts, about the equivalent of burning eleven 75-watt light bulbs at the same 
time. When the refrigerator turns itself on to adjust its interior temperature, 
the number on the monitor shoots up to 1,000 watts. According to The 
Energy Detective, my total energy cost for the day (just after noon) is $1.91.
Drawing the biggest gulp of electricity is the 1,500-watt stand-up radiator 
that’s parked next to my writing table and set to its minimum setting. When 
I turn off the heater, the energy level in my house instantly drops to .100 
kilowatts  —  the equivalent of a 100-watt light bulb. By turning off the radia-
tor and bundling up on tolerably cold days, I can cut my electricity bill by a 
quarter or a third.

32
Part I: Settling into a Green Gadget Mindset 
Reducing your household energy consumption by regulating the radiator is 
considerably easier when you have a monitor like The Energy Detective to 
visibly remind you exactly how much electricity you’re using and paying for.
 
Alternatively, plugging a radiator, TV, computer, or other device into a power 
monitor like the Kill A Watt, shown in Figure 2-2, can instantly tell you how 
many kilowatts a device uses when it’s turned on — and when it’s turned off. 
Unlike The Energy Detective, which uses sensors you install in your circuit 
breaker to monitor your entire home’s energy usage, the portable Kill A Watt 
has a single outlet. Plug in your TV or computer to measure how much energy 
each consumes. You can also plug in a power strip with several gadgets 
plugged into it, to find out how much energy they’re consuming when they’re 
all turned on, or when some are powered on and others turned off.
 
Figure 2-2:

Another energy-saving step I took was the purchase of a Belkin Conserve 
power strip, which comes with a remote control that lets me instantly power 
off devices plugged into up to eight of its switchable outlets. Two addi-
tional outlets are for always-on devices that stay on even when the others 
are switched off with the remote. I also added a power timer switch and a 
3-socket miniature power strip, which I use with the Belkin Conserve as |}
follows:
 
✓ Eight switchable outlets: I plug in my notebook charger, HDTV, Xbox 
360, PlayStation 3, VUDU movie downloading device, mobile phone char-
ger, printer, and backup hard drive. The included remote control lets me 
instantly power off all these energy vampires at once while leaving two 
of the strip’s always-on outlets turned on and receiving power.

33
 Chapter 2: Practicing Green Gadget Living
 
✓ Two always-on outlets and a 3-socket miniature power strip: I plug my 
Wi-Fi router into one always-on outlet, and plug my broadband cable 
modem and TiVo into the 3-socket power strip, which is plugged into the 
second always-on outlet. That way, I can continue recording some later 
news programs and connect to the Internet with my notebook when I’m 
sitting on the sofa or in bed before turning in for the night.
 
✓ Power timer switch: I plug the Belkin Conserve power strip into a power 
timer switch that I set to turn off at 1 p.m., and turn back on at 6 a.m. All 
devices that are plugged into the Conserve, including the devices in the 
always-on sockets that I mention in the preceding bullet, are powered 
off. This action, according to The Energy Detective, cuts my energy vam-
pire consumption to nearly zero.
Reducing Your Gadgets’ Carbon 
Footprints and E-Waste
The first of the green living Rs — reduce — can be summed up in three 
words: Less is more. Using less energy by turning off gadgets and devices 
when you aren’t using them, and adjusting their power settings to run more 
efficiently when they’re turned on, can provide more savings in both kilo-
watts and the amount of money you pay for them. Reducing the carbon foot-
print of your mobile phone or notebook computer might sound like a small 
feat, so to speak — until you consider that they’re only two of the many elec-
tronic devices most of us use every day.
 
Here’s a case in point: According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), an 
estimated 5 to 15 percent of the world’s domestic electricity is wasted by elec-
tronic devices idling their time in Standby mode.
If you take even the smallest energy-reducing actions against energy vam-
pires and other power-wasting features, you can reduce the bigger-picture 
carbon footprint created by the sum of your gadgets’ many parts. In many 
chapters, I tell you that plugging your mobile phone charger, TV, PC, and 
other “standby devices” into a power strip can help you easily pull the plug 
on all of them at one time when you shut off the switch. If you don’t want to 
bend down or reach behind your gear to hit the switch, you can invest in a 
smart power strip, like the Belkin Conserve. Thanks to the included remote 
control, cutting the power to most of the Conserve sockets is just a tap away. 
Another option is the Smart Strip LCG3, which senses when you turn off a 
device and cuts power to the outlet accordingly.
Here are some actions you can take to reduce your gadgets’ carbon footprint 
and keep them from contributing to the planet’s already huge e-waste pile:

34
Part I: Settling into a Green Gadget Mindset 
 
✓ Replace single-use disposable batteries in your gadgets with recharge-
able ones.
 
✓ Unplug your mobile phone, MP3 player, and other gadget chargers when 
the devices are fully charged or not in use.
 
✓ Plug your home computer and its peripheral devices into a power strip 
that turns everything off at one time.
 
✓ Disable your computer’s screen saver and change its power-saving set-
tings to turn off the display when you aren’t using it for more than five 
minutes.
 
✓ Adjust your computer’s power-saving settings to switch the computer 
to either Standby or Sleep mode whenever you aren’t using it for more 
than 15 minutes. Then switch to Hibernate mode after 30 minutes (if that 
feature is available).
 
✓ Read and review documents onscreen rather than print them on paper.
 
✓ Reduce the brightness of a display to its lowest comfortable setting — 
including mobile phones, MP3 players, digital cameras and camcorders, 
TVs, and notebook and desktop computers.
 
✓ Save trees and the carbon impact cost of buying printed books by 
downloading and reading e-books on your mobile phone or a dedicated 
e-book reader.
 
✓ Reduce fuel consumption and automobile emissions by shopping and 
banking online and by renting or buying downloadable and streaming 
movies and TV shows.
Reusing Your Gadgets and 
Electronics Gear
In certain instances, reuse and recycle (the second and third elements in the 
three Rs of green gadgets) are interchangeable. Reusing gadgets, comput-
ers, and other electronic devices rather than throwing them away or sending 
them to a recycler can help reduce your impact on the planet (and on your 
wallet). When you pass on to others who can use them your still-usable com-
puters or other gadgets you’ve outgrown, you’re practicing the ecofriendly 
act of reusing. Doing so extends the lives of usable products — and post-
pones their eventual entry into the waste stream.
The following list shows a few examples of the interchangeability of reusing 
and recycling. You can
 
✓ Refill spent inkjet or toner cartridges. This option is preferable to 
throwing them in the trash and buying new ones every time they’re 
empty.

35
 Chapter 2: Practicing Green Gadget Living
 
✓ Add more memory to your computer and install a bigger hard drive. 
Help it run faster and give it more storage space.
 
✓ Upgrade your Windows PC to Windows 7. Your computer consumes 
less power, thanks to new energy-saving features in Windows 7.
 
Repairing your broken computer, mobile phone, or other gadget can some-
times cost more than replacing it with a new one.
Even if it’s the end of the line for your unwanted, damaged, or hopelessly use-
less gadget or device, salvaging still usable or saleable parts from them can 
help reduce your overall impact on the environment when it’s time to say “so 
long.”
Other reuse actions you can take to live a green gadget lifestyle include the 
ones in this list:
 
✓ Replace single-use disposable batteries in your gadgets with recharge-
able ones that you can reuse again and again.
 
✓ Choose rewriteable (CD-RW/DVD-RW) CD and DVD discs rather than 
ones you can burn to only once (CD-R/DVD-R) for moving, sharing, and 
backing up music, video, documents, and other computer files.
 
✓ Consider upgrading your current computer rather than buying a new 
one. Adding internal memory, a bigger hard disk, a flat-screen display, or 
the latest version of the operating system can make an aging desktop or 
notebook feel new, or nearly new, again.
 
✓ Donate, sell, or give away gadgets, computers, and other electronics that 
you no longer want or use but that someone else can use.
Recycling Gadgets the Green Way
Although the third R of green gadgets is recycle, it doesn’t necessarily mean 
that the items you want to dispose of will be broken down into parts and 
ground up, melted, or otherwise destroyed. As I say in the preceding section, 
the terms recycle and reuse are sometimes interchangeable. For example, if 
you have someone repair or update a working gadget or computer that you 
don’t want or need and then put it back into someone else’s hands, that pro-
cess qualifies as both recycling and reusing. And yes, a bit of rethinking and 
reducing take place in the mix.
Why do I talk more about trying to reuse or repurpose gadgets instead of 
sending them off to a recycler? Here’s where the rethinking comes into play. 
Think about recycled paper. It comes from existing paper that is collected, 
processed, and then repurposed as new paper. By selling a gadget or giving 
it away, you’re repurposing it, but you’re also essentially recycling it. What’s 
cool here is that you’re skipping the processing part of breaking down a 

36
Part I: Settling into a Green Gadget Mindset 
gadget the way a recycler would when the gadget has truly reached its end. 
What’s more, reusing or repurposing a gadget means not having to pur-
chase a new product to replace it, which in turn means you’re reducing the 
resources and energy required to manufacture, package, ship, and use a new 
gadget.
 
Something you don’t want to reuse is personal information that might be 
stored on a computer or gadget that you’re giving away. Most repurposing 
programs promise to securely erase your personal information from your 
gadgets or computers before they send them to their eventual recipients. 
Regardless, I recommend checking out Chapter 15, where I show you how to 
prevent potentially unscrupulous recipients from snatching your personal 
information from unwanted gadgets and computers that you’re saying good-
bye to.
Here are some other places to look to incorporate recycling into your greener 
gadget lifestyle:
 
✓ Computer manufacturer’s Web site: Check to find out more about the 
manufacturer’s take-back, trade-in, and recycling programs.
 
✓ Electronics trade-in Web sites: Visit these sites to see whether your 
still-working but unwanted gadgets, computers, and other electronics 
can earn you cash or credit toward a new purchase.
 
✓ Your local newspaper’s classified ads or an Internet auction: Sell your 
unwanted gadgets, computers, and other working but unwanted elec-
tronic products in your local newspaper’s classified ads, or sell or auc-
tion them on the Web.
 
✓ Any major wireless provider’s retail store: Drop off your working but 
unwanted mobile phone so that it can be repurposed or properly recy-
cled. (Don’t forget the charger and any accessories you no longer want.)
 
✓ Your local video game store, such as GameStop or EB Games: Trade in 
your unwanted but working video game consoles, games, and accesso-
ries for store credit.
 
✓ A nearby or nationwide reputable recycler of e-waste (e-cycler): 
Properly disposing of broken or otherwise hopelessly useless electron-
ics rather than throwing them in the trash reduces potential hazards to 
the environment, and may also reduce waste if parts and materials can 
be extracted and reused or manufactured into new products.
Rethinking Your Gadget Purchases
After you deal with the standard three Rs of green gadgets, you have to con-
sider the “bonus R” and rethink any new gadget purchases and whether you 
truly need them. For example, if the gadget you’re thinking about replacing is 

37
 Chapter 2: Practicing Green Gadget Living
still working, or if it can be repaired (if it isn’t working) or upgraded (so that 
it can continue to serve you in a more useful way), maybe you don’t even 
need the new gadget. If, however, your old gadget can no longer serve you — 
or if you simply want the newest model to replace it— consider whether you 
can donate or sell the old one or give it away to a friend.
Rethinking also means considering new products with expressly green 
features and benefits that have a smaller negative impact on the environ-
ment. For instance, a notebook computer is a greener choice than a desktop 
computer because notebooks require fewer resources and energy to build, 
require less packaging and therefore can be shipped in greater quantities, 
and are less expensive to operate. Do you really need a power-and-resource 
hungry desktop, or can a notebook serve your computing needs? 
Replacing a cellphone that’s smashed beyond repair presents another oppor-
tunity to put on your rethinking cap. Step 1 is to drop the broken phone at a 
retail cellphone store to make sure it’s properly recycled (most do). Step 2 is 
to choose a new model with, for instance, a built-in solar recharger or hous-
ing case made from recycled water bottles. (See Chapter 11 to read about 
two cellphones with those exact attributes.)
Whatever you decide, the process of buying green gadgets and consumer 
electronics grows easier all the time. It seems that every company under the 
sun wants to be seen as green. As a consequence, major gadget manufactur-
ers have “gotten hip” to behaving in an ecofriendly way and offering ecof-
riendly products.
Even so, sorting through what’s real and what’s greenwash hype can be diz-
zying. (See Chapter 9 for pointers on making your way through greenwash 
hype.) According to the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) at myGreen-
Electronics.org, the good news is that more and more consumer electronics 
are now being produced that
 
✓ Contain fewer or no harmful chemicals or toxins
 
✓ Offer greater energy efficiency
 
✓ Are easier to upgrade, repair, and recycle
Here are some other actions you can take to rethink before you buy new 
gadgets:
 
✓ Visit Web sites, such as the ones in the following list, that evaluate, rate, 
and list greener electronics by category, brand, or another criteria:
 
• myGreenElectronics.org: http://mygreenelectronics.org
 
• Greener Choices: http://greenerchoices.org
 
• Energy Star: www.energystar.gov
 
• Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT): 
www.epeat.net

38
Part I: Settling into a Green Gadget Mindset 
 
✓ Stay up-to-date on how the top electronics companies rank against each 
other by visiting the Greenpeace Guide to Greener Electronics at www.
greenpeace.org/electronics.
 
✓ Visit the environmental sections on Web sites of companies that manu-
facture the products you’re considering buying to find out about their 
greener products, programs, services, and policies.
 
✓ Read news, features, and reviews of the latest ecofriendly products by 
visiting green gadget blogs and consumer electronics Web sites, such as 
the following:
 
• EcoGeek: www.ecogeek.org
 
• PC magazine’s Green Tech section: www.pcmag.com/category2/

Sharing Your Gadget Greenness 
with Others
Practice green gadget living by applying the three Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) 
and the bonus R (rethink) to all the electronic and energy-consuming devices 
in your life. Doing so can help you reduce your carbon footprint for the good 
of the planet — and for the good of others. But some folks might not be living 
the greener gadget life that they could be living. What do you do about it? 
You share what you do, and spread the information so that others know what 
to do. Sharing with others how to practice the four Rs can be as simple as 
making suggestions in these venues:
 
✓ At a gathering of friends, such as at a dinner party: Ask everyone 
around the table if they’re familiar with cellphone battery-zapping fea-
tures, such as Bluetooth, that they can turn off if they aren’t using them; 
if they’re not familiar with the features, show them how to use them how 
and to turn them off when they aren’t.
 
✓ At work: Help coworkers run screen savers and adjust their PC’s power 
settings to shut off their screens whenever they’re away from their 
desks for more than a few minutes.
 
✓ At the homes of family members and friends: Point out plugged-in gad-
gets and appliances that waste energy when they aren’t in use, and sug-
gest power strips that make it easy to turn off several gadgets at a time 
when they aren’t being used.

39
 Chapter 2: Practicing Green Gadget Living
Going a little further to turn other people on to the practices of living a 
greener gadget lifestyle can have a greater impact on reducing their carbon 
footprints. Consider taking these actions:
 
✓ Encourage family, friends, and coworkers to steer their Web browsers 
to carpooling and ride-sharing Web sites. Have them check sites such 
as Zimride (http://zimride.com), Rideshare Optimizer (http://
rideshareoptimizer.com), or the community classifieds Web site 
Craigslist (www.craigslist.org).
 
✓ Organize an e-cycling potluck party at work or among friends. You can 
gather unwanted but potentially useful and hopelessly useless gadgets 
and other electronics to arrange for donation or proper disposal and 
recycling.
 
✓ Visit the Stepcase Lifehack site to read the article “Arguing in Favor 
of Telecommuting: 5 Tips to Convince the Boss. It’s at tinyurl.com/
telecommuteyourboss. The article tells you how to encourage your 
boss to allow you and coworkers to telecommute one day a week or more; 
if you’re the boss, visit tinyurl.com/telecommuteyourworkers to 
read the article “9 Advantages to Companies Who Let Their Employees 
Telecommute.”
The bottom line to sharing your gadget greenness with others is to lead by 
example. In other words: Practice what you preach.

posable batteries because rechargeable ones are the only 
choice for any ecoconscious person. And that’s just one 
way you can “get green” with the gadgets you own. 
Another way is to adjust energy-saving settings, which can 
reduce how much energy a gadget uses — and how much 
you pay on your monthly utility bill. Still another way is to

If saying goodbye to wasting money and energy on throwaway batter-
ies makes good sense but you’re not sure where to begin, you’ve come to 
the right place. In this chapter, I give you the lowdown on the pluses and 
minuses of typical rechargeable and disposable batteries, help you determine 
which of your battery-operated gadgets and devices can benefit the most 
from making the switch, and point you to rechargeable battery pack replace-
ments that last longer than the ones supplied on your cellphone and other 
gadgets. Then I wrap it all up with advice on how to properly dispose of dead 
batteries after they lose their spark.

Understanding Basic Battery 
Pluses and Minuses
When you embrace the use of rechargeable batteries, you respect the three 
Rs: Reduce, reuse, recycle. When you replace disposable batteries with 
rechargeable batteries — which are also referred to as cells — you can
 
✓ Reduce the amount of money you pay from your pocket and reduce the 
amount of earth’s resources required to produce each “one-hit-wonder” 
battery
 
✓ Reuse the same rechargeable cell or pack repeatedly, for many months 
or years
 
✓ Recycle energy with each reuse, until it’s time to retire to a proper recy-
cler the long-life-of-service rechargeable battery
Considering that a single rechargeable battery can be recharged and reused 
hundreds of times, buying and throwing out ordinary batteries is just plain 
wasteful — and potentially hazardous if they’re improperly disposed of, 
because of the mercury and other toxins used to produce them.
 
An estimated 15 billion disposable alkaline batteries are produced and dis-
carded each year.
Find out how to properly dispose of both kinds of batteries at the end of this 
chapter, in the section “Properly Disposing of Dead Batteries.” To find out 
more about disposing of other gadgets and electronic e-waste, check out 
Chapter 16.
Hunting and Gathering Battery-Powered 
Gadgets in Your House
Making a game of searching for remote controls that might be lost in your 
sofa cushions is a helpful way to start saying adios to disposable batteries. 
I can think of a few other products and places (see Figure 3-1) that chew up 
and spit out disposable batteries like there’s no tomorrow.
Here’s a quick list of areas around the home to check for battery-operated 
gadgets, such as remote controls:
 
✓ Living room: This room of your house is likely to be Device Central, 
where remote controls live that drive your television or DVD player or 
that operate movie and music gadgets, such as Apple TV.

45
 Chapter 3: Saving Money (and the Planet) with Rechargeable Batteries
 
Figure 3-1: 
Search 
high and 
low to find 
all battery-
operated 
gadgets in 
your house.
 
 
✓ Play room: Wii controllers make you whirl your arms while bowling or 
whacking at a baseball, and the more you use them, the more you burn 
not only calories but also battery juice. While you’re at it, grab any other 
nearby video game controllers, such as the ones for the Xbox 360 or 
PlayStation 3. Don’t forget all those “old school” battery-powered games, 
such as Operation, Battleship, and Lite Brite (the precursor to the pixel).
 
✓ Kitchen drawer: You know where this drawer is — the one where you 
keep such items as your flashlight, electronic tape measure (when did 
that happen?), cordless hand mixer, digital egg timer, and other helpful 
cooking gizmos. While you’re in the kitchen, don’t forget the wall clock if 
it runs on a battery.
 
✓ Bathroom: Brushing up on battery-operated gizmos in the bathroom 
turns up reasonably cheapo devices, such as electric toothbrushes, 
beard and other body-hair trimmers, sing-in-the-shower radios, and digi-
tal scales. 
 
✓ Bedroom: Although sleep is the first order of business in the bedroom, 
its mishmash of battery-powered devices can include TV and video 
player remote controls, a travel alarm clock, a book reading light, a 
cellphone, a notebook computer, or any other gadget you store at the 
bedside.

46
Part II: Getting Green with Gadgets You Own 
 
✓ Home office: Less officially speaking, this room is wherever you park 
your computer. The usual battery-operated suspects include wireless 
mice and keyboards, and also digital recorders and cameras that use ordi-
nary batteries and other gadgets that connect to your computer, such as 
iPods and media players. These devices’ built-in rechargeable batteries 
eventually wear out and need to be replaced and properly recycled.
 
✓ Outdoors: This smorgasbord of portable gadgets includes your cell-
phone, digital camera, camcorder, and personal digital assistant (PDA) 
as well as automobile GPS navigators and outdoor recreation compan-
ions, such as camping lamps and pedometers. And, those ubiquitous 
entertainers — the AM/FM radio, boom box, and DVD player — can suck 
down a six-pack of disposable cells before sundown.
You most likely recall the last time you groaned because a gadget’s battery 
died and you didn’t have a spare on hand. Think of all the times you shelled 
out greenbacks for single-use batteries. When you use rechargeable batteries, 
you don’t have to waste money and energy on these duds.
 
Before you spend another dime on single-use batteries, step away from the 
store register, return to the battery rack, and pick up a rechargeable-battery 
kit. It typically has two or four AA or AAA cells (or a combination) and a char-
ger. You’ll thank yourself for making the investment — and you’ll be relieved 
not to have to return to the store the next time you need a battery.
Sorting Out and Choosing Rechargeable 
Batteries and Chargers
Getting up to speed on the use of rechargeable batteries (and the chargers 
that juice them) to replace familiar disposable batteries is the topic I discuss 
in this section. In the “Finding Rechargeable Battery Packs” section, near 
Rechargeables in my house: Part 1
Taking stock of battery-operated gadgets and 
gear in my house turned up the following inven-
tory of computer-related items, listed with the 
types of batteries they use:
 ✓ Notebook computer (four): Replaceable 
rechargeable batteries
 ✓ Notebook mouse (two), from Microsoft: 
One AA battery and two AAA batteries
 ✓ A pair of 3D virtual reality goggles, from 
Vuzix: Built-in battery
 ✓ A portable Bluetooth thermal printer, from 
PLANon Printstick: Built-in battery

47
 Chapter 3: Saving Money (and the Planet) with Rechargeable Batteries
the end of this chapter, I go over your options for replacing the rechargeable 
battery packs supplied with your cordless or mobile phone, electric tooth-
brush, portable handheld vacuum cleaner, and notebook computer.
I also cover out-of-the-ordinary rechargeable solutions, such as flashlights 
and radios, that recharge with good ol’ elbow grease (or, technically speak-
ing, kinetically powered gadgets and gizmos), which I describe in various 
chapters in Part IV.
Before I get into the details of rechargeable batteries (and chargers), here is a 
list of general tips:
 
✓ Use rechargeable batteries in any gadget that takes alkaline batteries.
 
✓ Recharge rechargeable batteries hundreds of times (typically) — to save 
lots of money over the long haul.
 
✓ Avoid mixing new rechargeable batteries with old ones because a 
weaker battery (or more) prevents the combination from offering maxi-
mum capacity and performance.
The phenomenon of memory effect, which causes older rechargeable bat-
teries to retain less of their total charge capacity over time, doesn’t plague 
modern nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) rechargeable batteries.
Gauging matters of size, 
type, power, and price
The ability to replace single-use batteries with rechargeable ones is a matter 
of cell size and power capacity — which in turn determine price. Cheaper 
rechargeable batteries hold less power and drain faster than costlier, longer-
lasting batteries.
Finding rechargeable batteries sized to fit your gadgets is a cinch because 
they’re generally available in the most commonly recognized sizes, as shown 
in Figure 3-2.

tery sizes.

Battery energy capacity is measured in milliampere hours (mAh). Longer-
lasting batteries have higher mAh numbers than their short-lived counterparts.
Battery maker Rayovac defines the three types of everyday rechargeable bat-
tery choices this way:
 
✓ Everyday use: Offers the best value in rechargeable power for high-drain 
devices and is generally available in all standard battery sizes.
 
✓ High energy: Adds power and is available in all standard battery sizes.
 
✓ Precharged (which Rayovac dubs Hybrid): Provides the most power 
and maintains its charge longer than ordinary rechargeable batteries — 
and is ready to use right out of the package. Unfortunately, this type is 
generally available in only two sizes: small (AA) and smaller (AAA).
 
The phenomenon of self discharge causes fully charged rechargeable batteries 
to run down even when they’re lying around unused. 
Duracell estimates that an ordinary rechargeable battery loses about 1 
percent of its charge per day. Put another way, after 100 days, a charged 
rechargeable battery of this type dies whether or not it’s inside a gadget.
Slow-discharge precharged batteries (such as the Rayovac Hybrid, the 
Duracell precharged, and the Sanyo eneloop line of rechargeable batteries) 
give up their power ghost v-e-r-y slowly — so slowly that a year after charg-
ing them, they’re good-to-go into your gadget with nearly a full charge.
Sanyo says that its eneloop line of rechargeable batteries retains an 85 per-
cent charge after one year of storage, as shown in Figure 3-3. For a technical 
explanation of how the company pulls it off, have a look at the nearby side-
bar, “Sanyo’s take on self-discharge.”
 
A NiMH rechargeable battery is always the greener choice because it doesn’t 
contain the hazardous toxins found in the older nickel-cadmium (NiCd) cell 
that the NiMH version has all but replaced. And, if that’s not reason enough, 
I urge you to check out the nearby sidebar, “Memory effect, R.I.P.” Don’t say I 
didn’t warn you.
Schooling yourself in battery matters
If you’re looking for a depository of technical 
information about battery-related information, 
see BatteryUniversity.com, which offers prac-
tical battery knowledge for engineers, educa-
tors, students, and ordinary battery users alike. 
The site’s easy-to-read articles — a maximum 
of 1,000 words — cover battery chemistries, the 
best battery choices, and tips to make batteries 
last longer.

 Chapter 3: Saving Money (and the Planet) with Rechargeable Batteries
 
Figure 3-3: 
Sanyo has 
reduced 
the self-
discharge in 
its eneloop 
batteries.
 
Sanyo’s take on self-discharge
The self-discharge of Ni-MH batteries is caused 
by three main factors::
 ✓ Chemical decomposition of the cathode
 ✓ Natural disaggregation of the anode
 ✓ Impurities of the anode
To reduce the self-discharge in its eneloop bat-
teries, Sanyo uses a new hydrogen-absorbing 
superlattice alloy, which also increases the 
electrical capacity of the battery. By reduc-
ing internal resistance, the batteries have 
higher discharge currents than conventional 
rechargeables. Strengthening the anode by 
improving the electrolyte composition reduces 
the natural decomposition process, which also 
contributes to the eneloop’s longer-lasting 
charge. Sanyo estimates that its eneloop bat-
teries offer up to four times more power when 
used in a digital camera. The battery maker 
says the eneloop maintains its charge even 
in freezing temperatures down to 23 degrees 
Fahrenheit, and because they’re ready to use 
right out of the box, you don’t have to recharge 
them before you use them, as with ordinary 
NiMH rechargeables. Sanyo estimates that you 
can recharge an eneloop battery up to 1,000 
times without experiencing a “memory effect” 
that plagues older.

Picturing how long battery types last
Because a digital camera requires lots of power to pull off its digital magic, 
especially when its flash feature is used, battery makers often point to this 
device as a real-world measuring stick that most people can relate to. The 
following minitable provides a snapshot of rechargeable-battery capacity and 
longevity based on the number of pictures per charge that Rayovac estimates 
can typically be snapped per battery type.
Battery Type

Most battery manufacturers recommend higher-capacity rechargeable 
batteries for digital cameras, whereas low-powered, low-drain gadgets such 
as TV remote control devices can run for many months on less pricey 
rechargeables.
Getting a charge out of chargers
Rechargeable battery chargers are available in many shapes and sizes. The 
most commonly sold chargers hold two to four AA or AAA batteries, or a 
combination of both types of batteries. Figure 3-4 shows a typical charger.
Memory effect, R.I.P.
Once upon a time, longtime users of recharge-
able batteries (like me) coped with a type of 
reusable-battery dementia known as memory 
effect. Memory effect describes how older 
types of rechargeable batteries that aren’t 
allowed to fully discharge before being 
recharged “remember” the shortened cycle, 
thereby offering reduced capacity the next time 
they are charged. Trust me: I’m happy to forget 
all about it, which is why I mention it in a side-
bar, where you’re perfectly welcome to forget 
that you ever heard the term.
You can find a fuller explanation of memory 
effect at www.Zbattery.com.

Although many rechargeable battery chargers look much the same, and you 
might think that they work the same way, the following charger characteris-
tics can help you determine which charger type best suits your needs:
 
✓ Charging speed: Charging a rechargeable battery in a pricier fast 
charger can juice the cells to usable capacity in as little as 15 minutes, 
whereas a less costly “value” charger can spend several hours charging 
a battery to its full capacity.
 
✓ Brand mixing: You can charge one brand of rechargeable battery in 
another brand’s charger as long as the other charger is designed to 
charge the same type of battery (NiMH or NiCD, for example).
 
✓ Charging sensors: A “smart” battery charger has built-in sensors to 
shut off the charger after the batteries are fully charged. Chargers with-
out charging sensors continuously drain power even when they’re not 
hungry for it. (These are known as energy vampires, and I discuss them 
further in Chapter 1.)
 
✓ Mobile battery chargers: A mobile battery charger, such as the one 
shown in Figure 3-5, looks and works like an ordinary battery charger — 
with a twist. Unplugged from the wall, a mobile battery charger can act 
as a portable charger for one or more gadgets, such as cellphones, iPods, 
and other MP3 players, digital cameras, and Bluetooth headsets.

Rechargeable batteries that are too hot to handle in the charger are a sign of 
possible trouble with your home’s power level. If the batteries in a charger feel 
hot when you touch them, unplug the charger, insert another set of recharge-
able batteries, and then plug the charger back into the wall outlet. If the bat-
teries still feel too hot, plug the charger into a different outlet in another room 
of your house, if possible.

Choosing rechargeable 
batteries and chargers
The process of buying rechargeable batteries to replace the single-use ver-
sions that power your numerous gadgets generally begins with a starter kit 
that includes a charger and a minimum of two batteries. Shapes, sizes, capac-
ities, and prices vary, as you see in the following sections.
Basic AA and AAA rechargeable-battery kits
The types of rechargeable-battery kits that I often spot at drugstore 
chains and larger grocery stores are typically made by Duracell, Energizer, 
Eveready, and Rayovac. The kits charge as many as four AA or AAA batteries 
or a combination of the two types. The approximate price of each type of kit 
is included in this list:
 
✓ Value: This slow-to-charge type of kit, which comes with lower-capacity 
starter batteries, costs about $10.
Rechargeables in my house: Part 2
An additional search of my house turned up the 
following batch of gadgets, listed with the types 
of batteries they use:
 ✓ Beard trimmer, from Conair: Two AA 
batteries
 ✓ Electronic toothbrush, from Braun Oral-B: 
Built-in battery
 ✓ Nintendo DS and Sony PlayStation Portable 
game consoles: Replaceable rechargeable 
battery packs
 ✓ Game controllers (three) from Sony, 
Nintendo, and Microsoft: Add-on recharge-
able battery packs
 ✓ iPhone, from Apple: Built-in non-user-
replaceable battery
 ✓ iPod nano, from Apple: Built-in non-user-
replaceable battery
 ✓ LED bike light, from Petzl: Three AAA bat-
teries (repurposed as a book light for bed-
side reading)
 ✓ Power strip remote control, from Belkin 
Conserve: An A23 12V battery
 ✓ Smartphones (two) from Nokia and Palm: 
Replaceable rechargeable battery packs
 ✓ Smoke detector, from Black and Decker: A 
9-volt battery
Charging the batteries for my beard trimmer, 
reading light, and wireless notebook mice is 
a single Eveready eight-cell charger, which 
charges four AA and four AAA rechargeable 
batteries at the same time.
The only devices at my house that use single-
use batteries are the smoke detector and the 
Belkin Conserve power strip remote control — 
oh, the irony!

54
Part II: Getting Green with Gadgets You Own 
 
✓ Fast and smart: This type of kit typically comes with higher-capacity 
starter batteries and a faster charger with features such as Energy Star 
sensors and On-Off buttons, costs about $25. An example is shown in 
Figure 3-6.
 
✓ Mobile: A mobile recharger kit, which costs about $30, has features 
similar to the type in the preceding bullet, and it can act as a portable 
charger for multiple USB-chargeable gadgets, such as smartphones, MP3 
players, and Bluetooth headsets.

Recycling dead rechargeable batteries completes the recycle portion of “the 
three Rs” (reduce, reuse, recycle). Turn to the section “Properly Disposing of 
Dead Batteries,” at the end of this chapter, to find out how to recycle yours.
Less common and wider-reaching chargers
Finding rechargeable batteries and chargers for sizes less common than AA 
and AAA — such as 9-volt, C, D, and hearing-aid and other flat, button cell 
batteries (see Figure 3-7) — may mean making a trip to your nearest super-
store or Radio Shack. In these stores, you’re most likely to find the larger-
capacity chargers that hold and charge many batteries — and many sizes — at 
one time.
Visiting an electronics superstore or buying online offers the highest number 
of rechargeable-battery and -charger options, from solo 9-volt batteries and 
4-cell kits to smart auto-shutoff and multicell decks that can charge a dozen 
or more rechargeables of different sizes and types at the same time (see 
Figure 3-8).

Replacing rechargeable batteries in iPods, 
iPhones, and other sealed gadgets
Replacing the rechargeable battery inside an iPod or MacBook Air or another 
sealed device isn’t as easy as simply swapping the old one for a new one. 
Contacting Apple or the maker of another sealed gadget to make arrange-
ments to send in your gadget for a rechargeable battery swap generally 
ensures an installation of the highest possible quality — and the highest price.
 
Saving money by replacing sealed device batteries with a do-it-yourself kit is 
another option for technically adept or adventurous types. LaptopsForLess.
com sells a kit for less than $15 — battery, surgical tool, and instructions 
included.

Properly Disposing of Dead Batteries
You don’t have to just sit and stare at a pile of dead single-use batteries after 
swapping them out for rechargeable ones. By getting rid of batteries the 
green way (and those depleted rechargeable battery cells and battery packs), 
you can complete the cycle of the three Rs: Reduce, reuse, recycle.
Determining how to dispose of batteries depends on whether they’re single-
use or rechargeable cells.
Disposable batteries
Single-use, nonrechargeable batteries are categorized by the federal govern-
ment as nonhazardous waste, which means that most states don’t consider it 
unlawful to toss them in the trash.
 
Only two U.S. locales take exception to haphazard battery disposal:
 
✓ California: Requires nonhouseholds to dispose of batteries in accor-
dance with the California universal waste rule.
 
✓ Hennepin County (Minnesota): Requires consumers and nonconsumers 
alike to treat batteries as hazardous waste.
Sending batteries to landfills or incinerators can cause the batteries’ contents 
to potentially wind up in the soil, air, ground or surface water, and, ulti-
mately, the food chain and drinking water supply.
Follow these guidelines to avoid this problem:
 
✓ Take the dead batteries to a local hazardous waste drop-off facility in 
your area, if one exists.
 
✓ Call your local municipality’s public works department to find out 
whether it collects dead batteries or offers drop-off locations where you 
can dispose of them yourself.
 
✓ Check your local library, grocery, hardware, camera, electronics, drug, 
or other retail or superstore to see whether it offers collection bins for 
single-use, nonrechargeable batteries (see Figure 3-9).

58
Part II: Getting Green with Gadgets You Own 
 
✓ Call your local EPA office or check your state’s environmental agency 
Web site (www.epa.gov/epahome/state.htm) to see whether it can 
point you to a nearby household battery drop-off location.
 
✓ Search your zip code on the Web site Earth911.org to find a battery recy-
cling drop box in your area.
 
Figure 3-9: 
Look for 
recycle bins 
like these.
 
Searching Earth911.com for drop-off locations in rural areas (such as my 
own) turned up plenty that accept rechargeable batteries, but none for 
single-use batteries. Entering my old Manhattan zip code, however, revealed 
lots of drop-off locations, including the Whole Foods store not far from my 
last residence in the city.
 
If tossing your dead single-use batteries in the trash is your only option until 
better disposal ways are discovered, keeping these tips in mind can help 
lessen their potential negative impact on the environment:
 
✓ Remove and dispose of dead batteries immediately.
 
✓ Dispose of batteries in small quantities if you’re throwing out more than 
a few.
 
✓ Make sure not to allow your batteries to be burned. They can explode 
and cause injury to you and to the environment.

Maximizing Energy Savings 
for Your Portable Gadgets
In This Chapter
▶ Looking into some gadget energy-saving settings
▶ Extending the battery life on mobile gadgets
▶ Running mobile applications to track and adjust energy use
W
hether you’re turning to this chapter first or moseying over from 
another one, this is the place to find out how to adjust the energy set-
tings on your portable gadgets to gain maximum battery life on the go while 
minimizing power consumption.
I begin with the battery-consumption boot camp basics and then walk you 
through the steps to adjust energy settings for extending your gadgets’ 
waking hours between visits to the wall outlet. I also turn you on to some 
cool, downloadable applications for monitoring and minimizing your gadgets’ 
(and your own) carbon footprint.
Welcome to your new and longer-lasting (battery) way of life!
Getting a Grip on a Gadget’s 
Energy-Saving Settings
Getting green and doing the right thing with all the gadgets and electronic 
items in your life is most likely why you’re reading this book, but if you 
turned to this chapter before reading any of the others, I probably know the 
reason:

62
Part II: Getting Green with Gadgets You Own 
Blame it on the battery.
Am I right?
Let’s face it: We’ve both done it (and possibly everyone else who reads this 
book) — blaming, or perhaps cursing, our most essential gadget’s battery 
for running out of juice at the worst possible time. It might have happened 
in the middle of an important phone call or halfway through the motivating 
song you rely on to help push you to finish your run or workout. In the worst-
case scenario, the battery dies and not until you awaken later than usual and 
plug in your gadget again can you call your boss and apologize for being late 
because your alarm didn’t go off.
Although it’s my job to know the ins and outs of every gadget I own, review, 
or write about in books like this one, I’m always happy to show friends or 
family members — or readers — how to adjust or turn off any energy-zapping 
features they might not know about.
That’s what I do for you, by helping you adjust or turn off the power-draining 
features (see Figure 4-1) on your gadgets to make them last longer between 
charges.
 
Figure 4-1: 
To extend 
a gadget’s 
battery life,

wireless 
features you 
don’t use.
 

63
 Chapter 4: Maximizing Energy Savings for Your Portable Gadgets
Battery-draining items
You can less frequently blame your gadget’s battery for bringing your pro-
ductivity or playtime to a standstill if you pay attention to a few elements 
that most gadgets expend a lot of energy on — often gratuitously — to keep 
you happy.
 
Powerfully pleasing — but power-hungry — factors that have the biggest 
impact on how long batteries last between charges include the ones in this 
list:
 
✓ Screen: The screen, when putting on its brightest face possible, is 
generally the biggest drain on your gadget’s battery life. Adjusting the 
screen’s brightness setting to the lowest comfortable level and making 
adjustments to automatically dim or turn off the screen display after cer-
tain actions or periods of inactivity help to reduce the screen’s draining 
contribution to your gadget’s overall battery life. An example of a screen 
brightness setting is shown in Figure 4-2.
 
Figure 4-2: 
Dim the 
screen to 
save power.
 
 
✓ Sound: Pumping up the volume to get your attention or play a song 
takes lots of energy. Whether it’s ultra-ear-awing polyphonic ringtones 
or a double-disc greatest hits collection, lowering the sound level length-
ens battery life. Listening with headphones saves even more power. 
Shutting off sound completely if you aren’t using it offers even longer 
stretches of time between charges. Turning on a mobile phone’s vibrate 
feature is polite during meetings or movie moments, but that buzzing 
feeling comes at a price because it taxes the battery every time it gives 
you that quiet-loving feeling. 
 
✓ Wireless: Turning on only features in use extends battery life. Using 
wireless technology for making and receiving phone calls, e-mails, and 
text messages; browsing the Web; pinpointing your current location in 
the world; beaming your business card to an associate or staying in sync 
with your computer; and listening to music or carrying on a conversa-
tion over an untethered headset makes your life easier — but not your 
gadget battery’s life. The key culprits to look for are Bluetooth, WiFi, and 
GPS and speedier data service network boosters such as EDGE and 3G.

64
Part II: Getting Green with Gadgets You Own 
 
✓ Hard drives: A spinning hard disk inside a gadget, such as the older 
Apple iPod and its single hard-drive-based model, drains a battery 
faster than a solid-state memory device without a hard disk, such as the 
iPhone or the iPod nano. Some Windows netbook (miniature) computers 
have solid-state memory, while others have hard disks spinning inside 
them. Changing the Windows power options, shown in Figure 4-3, to 
stop the hard disk after a specified number of minutes extends battery 
life, as described in Chapter 7.
 
Figure 4-3: 
Turning off 
the hard 
disk to yield 
big energy 
gains.
 
 
✓ Heat: Batteries drain faster when they’re hot rather than running warm 
and at room temperature. Keeping your gadgets cool by not letting them 
roast in car glove boxes or sit near winter-warming radiators extends 
battery life.
 
✓ Dirt: Dust, dirt, belly button fuzz, and other debris and impurities collect 
on your gadgets’ battery contacts and can hamper proper contact and 
charging. First turn off the device and unplug it from its wall charger, 
and then gently clean exposed contacts with a cotton swab or dust-free 
cloth dipped in rubbing alcohol, as shown in Figure 4-4, to keep the bat-
tery’s internal connection strong and unencumbered.
The more specific energy-saving settings described in the following sections 
can help you eke out the longest battery life possible from all your favorite 
gadgets.
The time for battery savings change is now!

Cellphones and smartphones
The heading of this section is sort of a catchall because the reality is that 
many gadgets nowadays are catchalls themselves. In the old days — which, 
in the world of technology, can mean last year, although I’m talking about ten 
years ago — gadgets did one or two tasks well. MP3 players played music. 
PDAs, such as the original PalmPilot, kept bits of information close at hand. 
Cellphones mainly made and received phone calls.
A little later, MP3 players began showing off photos. PDAs got connected and 
started running miniature applications that performed many of the tasks that 
computers could do, albeit on a Lilliputian scale. Cellphones became smarter 
too, and some, like the iPhone, even called themselves smartphones as they 
began doing the work of those other gadgets — while still letting you make 
and receive phone calls.
Bringing so many gadgets together into a single device that you can hold in 
one hand is by nature a greener way of getting along with the planet.

66
Part II: Getting Green with Gadgets You Own 
 
If the only setting you change on your cellphone is its ringtone, getting to 
know your device’s other settings may reward you with longer talk times and 
less recharging.
Because settings vary widely depending on brand and model, you may need 
to poke around to find the individual energy-saving settings on your cell-
phone or smartphone.
To adjust the energy settings for my iPhone, for example, I access them from 
the same Settings menu. Although my Nokia also has a Settings menu, it isn’t 
where I choose or change options such as the ringtone or vibration level. You 
find these options by opening the Profiles tab, shown in Figure 4-5, and then 
customize profiles to match different scenarios, such as Movie Time (shhh!) 
or Cityscape, where the ring volume is turned up full blast so that I can hear 
it over honking taxi horns.
 
Figure 4-5: 
Trying to 
find a 
setting.
 
Here are the top battery-busting energy settings you can adjust or turn off if 
you aren’t using them:
 
✓ On and off: Powering off your phone when you know that you won’t use 
it for a while is the basic way to save power.
 
✓ Brightness: Turning down the brightness level on a cellphone or smart-
phone to its dimmest level (while maintaining comfort) goes a long way 
toward lengthening your gadget’s battery life. Activating a phone’s auto-
matic brightness feature adjusts the brightness to match your physi-
cal environment so that the screen dims at night or in a movie theater 
and increases to become visible on a sunny day or in a well-lit setting. 
Setting the screen to automatically dim after fifteen seconds or so is 
another option to activate if your phone has that setting.
 
✓ Auto-shutoff, lock, and sleep: Setting your phone to automatically lock 
itself or go to sleep prevents it from waking up in your pocket if you 
accidentally bump it. Some phones let you manually lock them by press-
ing a button, whereas you lock certain other phone models by pressing 
a combination of buttons. 

67
 Chapter 4: Maximizing Energy Savings for Your Portable Gadgets
 
✓ Volume: Turning down or shutting off your phone’s ringtone helps save 
battery life. Adjusting sound effects and alerts for other actions — such 
as receiving a text or e-mail message or your phone’s alarm clock — to 
the lowest level possible helps extend your phone’s battery life.
 
✓ Vibrate: Turning on the vibrate feature can alert you to a call without 
making a sound, but keep in mind that vibrating uses battery juice. 
Setting your phone to vibrate only once or a few times is an energy-
saving option on many phones.
 
✓ Equalizer: One other, often overlooked, power-gobbling option to turn 
off if your phone also plays music tracks is its equalizer, or EQ, as shown 
in Figure 4-6. Leaving this option on makes your phone work harder to 
produce the sound-quality effect you want. Turning off the option on 
your phone but keeping it activated on your computer’s music-playing 
program, such as iTunes, is generally an option.
 
✓ Network: Sensing your wireless carrier’s phone network signal is a task 
that your phone does continually to keep you connected. Turning off 
your phone’s Network option when you’re in rural areas where recep-
tion is spotty or unavailable can save power. Turning off the phone 
if you aren’t using it for other tasks, such as listening to music, saves 
even more power. The Network option isn’t the same as the one that 
connects to a WiFi network for accessing the Internet or files on your 
company’s server, however. (That option is next on our list, in case your 
phone has it.)
 
Figure 4-6: 
Turn off the 
equalizer to 
extend bat-
tery life.
 

68
Part II: Getting Green with Gadgets You Own 
 
 Leaving the Network option on but turning off data networking enhance-
ments that give you faster Web access or clearer calls (if your phone has 
those options) can also help extend battery life. The most talked-about 
wireless carrier enhancement is 3G, which is an abbreviation for third 
generation.
 
✓ Wi-Fi: Turning off your phone’s Wi-Fi connection if you aren’t using it to 
connect to the Internet to browse Web pages, check e-mail, or download 
music can go a long way toward extending your phone’s battery life. 
Keeping the Wi-Fi connection on if you’re using it but turning it off to 
automatically search for and connect to new Wi-Fi networks your phone 
detects is a good compromise to keep the connection alive but minimize 
the power it uses, as shown in Figure 4-7.
 
Figure 4-7: 
Sniffing for 
Wi-Fi sucks 
battery 
juice.
 
 
✓ Bluetooth: Connecting your phone to a Bluetooth headset and turning it 
on saves you from having to hold the phone to your ear — and speeds 
up battery drain. Turning Bluetooth on only when you’re using it and 
turning it off when you aren’t can give your phone markedly longer bat-
tery life. Connecting to another Bluetooth-equipped phone or computer 
to send and receive pictures, files, business cards, or other types of 
information also drains a battery more quickly, and if you aren’t using 
your phone for these tasks, by all means give Bluetooth the ax.
 
✓ GPS: Continually tracking your location by using your phone’s global 
positioning system (GPS) feature makes a cinch of finding your way 
around on the road or locating a new restaurant in town (see Figure 4-8). 
Of course, this awesomely useful feature sucks more battery life when 
it’s turned on than off, so if you aren’t using it, turn it down.

69
 Chapter 4: Maximizing Energy Savings for Your Portable Gadgets
 
Figure 4-8:

way with

the battery 
faster.
 
 
✓ Infrared: Beaming business cards from your phone to a phone used by a 
work associate or friend or wirelessly sharing files between your phone 
and computer by way of infrared radiation, or IR (drum roll, please) 
shortens a gadget’s battery life. Although IR isn’t as common as it was 
before Bluetooth arrived on the scene, some new gadgets are supplied 
with the infrared option. Check the settings on your phone or other 
gadget to see whether it uses IR (like the Palm Centro does). If you aren’t 
using it, you know what to do: Shut it off.
MP3 and media players
Adjusting or turning off some of the options and features described earlier in 
this chapter — such as brightness, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth — applies here, and 
then some:
 
✓ Brightness and Lock: Watching a movie with your portable media 
player’s screen brightness set to its maximum level makes sense, but 
keeping it that way when the gadget is in your pocket while you’re listen-
ing to music wastes power. That power could keep your tunes playing 
longer if the brightness were turned down or off. Tucking your player 
into a pocket without turning on its lock feature, as shown in Figure 4-9, 
can cause it to start playing if you accidentally bump or brush it. Tend 
to these two options to ensure longer playing time.

70
Part II: Getting Green with Gadgets You Own 
 
Figure 4-9:

accidental

rundown.
 
 
✓ Battery capacity: Opening your iPod or almost any other sealed gadget 
instantly voids its warranty, so be sure to contact the gadget’s manu-
facturer directly to arrange a swap for a longer-lasting battery if the 
warranty hasn’t yet expired. Sending a sealed gadget to a seller that 
upgrades the battery for you is a smart choice if your device is out of 
warranty. A do-it-yourself kit is another option if you’re technically 
adept or the adventurous type.
 
 The Web site BatteryShip.com offers kits for players, such as the iPod 
and Zune, and replacement batteries for numerous other portable 
gadgets.
 
✓ Hard drives and big audio files: An MP3 player with a built-in hard 
drive, such as certain iPod and Zune models, copies as much of a music 
track as possible to a device’s solid-state memory and then spins down 
the hard drive to save battery life. Playing huge files requires the hard 
drive to reactivate more frequently — which can cause the battery to 
run down more quickly.
 
 
To trim track sizes while retaining audio quality, you can adjust the 
way your computer’s music player software converts CDs to digital 
music (which you then copy to your portable player). Changing either 
Windows Media Player’s or iTune’s default importing (that is, ripping) 
formats from their defaults to MP3 can double track sizes. Keeping the 
default importing formats — WMA for Windows Media Player, and AAC, 
as shown in Figure 4-10, for iTunes — can cut track sizes by as much as 
half.
 
 If you changed your computer’s music player’s importing format to MP3 
and want to change back to the more efficient (and default) formats, 
here’s how:
 
 For Windows Media Player: From the Now Playing menu, choose 
More Options. On the Rip Music tab, choose Windows Media Audio 
from the Format drop-down menu (under Rip Settings).
 
 For iTunes: Click the menu iTunes (Mac) or Edit (Windows) and 
then choose Preferences. On the General tab, click the Import 
Settings button and then select AAC from the Import Using drop-
down menu.

Digital cameras and camcorders
Just like with your other portable gadgets, making energy-saving adjustments 
to your digital camera or camcorder that extend battery life can increase the 
number of shots or hours of footage you can capture. And as with all porta-
ble gadgets that have backlit screens, turning down the brightness uses less 
battery juice.
For even longer camera and camcorder battery life:
 
✓ Look through the viewfinder. Turning off your camcorder’s LCD view-
finder and looking through the lens instead (if your model has one) can 
help the battery last longer. Ditto for your digital camera’s LCD view-
finder and preview feature. Shutting off the small screen and waiting 
until the gadget is plugged in again to preview snapshots or captured 
video also keeps the battery alive much longer.
 
✓ Focus on focusing less. Partly pressing the shutter release on your 
digital camera or camcorder to gauge or activate the autofocus feature 
makes the gadget’s motor whir, which uses lots of power. Focus on test-
ing the focus less often, until you’re truly ready to take the shot.
 
✓ Deactivate your digital camera’s flash setting and your camcorder’s spot-
light. Doing so prevents you from accidentally using either feature — and 
extends battery life. Turn them on when you need them, and turn them off 
when you don’t.
 
✓ Stay in charge. Bringing along a second or third rechargeable battery 
can keep the action rolling throughout the day. Plugging in between 
shooting sessions to keep the battery topped off is another way to stay 
in charge of the battery on your camera or camcorder so that it lasts as 
long as possible.

Running Mobile Applications 
to Monitor and Adjust Power
Downloading and running an application to monitor or adjust a gadget’s 
carbon footprint — and your own — can help you do “the greener thing” 
wherever you are. Check out these popular applications:
 
✓ greenMeter: This application for the iPhone and iPod touch helps lower 
your vehicle’s impact on the environment by weighing parameters such 
as its tonnage and the price of gasoline against your driving behavior. 
By tapping into the iPhone’s built-in accelerometer to gauge the vehi-
cle’s rate of forward acceleration, greenMeter, at http://hunter.
pairsite.com/greenmeter, calculates vehicle readings such as fuel 
efficiency and carbon footprint (see Figure 4-11).
 
Figure 4-11:

footprint.
 
 
✓ Ecorio: Running on a Google Android-based mobile phone near you, 
Ecorio (www.ecorio.org) taps into the phone’s GPS feature to track 
movement to calculate your personal carbon footprint. Choosing your 
mode of travel — car, bus, train, or bicycle — determines how seriously 
green you are about getting around. Ecorio suggests carpool options by 
matching up drivers and passengers and lets fellow green-gadgeteers 
keep tabs on each other in the same town or across the country. The 
option to buy carbon offsets by way of Carbonfund.org is only a credit 
card number away.
 
✓ Carbon-Meter: Coming soon to Google Android and Blackberry smart-
phones, the iPhone version of Carbon-Meter (www.viralmesh.com/

Energy Savings All Around 
the House
In This Chapter
▶ Applying basic energy savings at home
▶ Looking around your house for energy savings
▶ Intensifying your power savings on TVs and entertainment gear
A
djusting the options on the power-hungry electronic devices all around 
your house adds to your global contribution to helping save the planet. 
Just as importantly, the practice saves you money on your monthly electric 
bill.
I begin with a few reminders on green living practices, such as remembering 
to turn off the lights when you leave the room, and then describe the most 
common energy-saving opportunities on the consumer electronics in your 
house.
From there, I point out built-in energy-saving features that you might not 
know about, and then tell you which common settings to look for and how to 
adjust them.
This chapter focuses on energy savings for all gadgets and electronic devices 
in your house, except for your Mac and Windows computers — both of which 
receive full treatment in Part III.
Practicing Green Living in Your House
Use green living practices on the following items to gain greater savings ben-
efits (which I describe in a few pages) from the energy settings on your elec-
tronic gadgets:

Part II: Getting Green with Gadgets You Own 
 
✓ Off switch: Turn off any device you aren’t using.
 
✓ Plug-in timers: Turn lights and appliances on and off with automated 
timers set to match your schedule.
 
✓ Thermostat: Set your home’s thermostat to 78 degrees in the summer 
and to 68 degrees in the winter.
 
 
If you have a programmable thermostat, set its standard Day, Night, 
Wake, and Sleep settings to maximize energy savings. See the following 
sidebar, “Use a programmable thermostat — and then walk away,” for 
more information about this handy gizmo.
 
✓ Your computer’s screen saver: Choose the None or Blank setting 
instead of an animated screen saver.
 
✓ Your computer’s monitor: Use your computer’s power-saving settings 
to turn off your monitor or notebook display after a few minutes of 
inactivity.
 
✓ Your computer’s sleep settings: Put your computer in Sleep mode or 
Hibernate mode to power it down shortly after the display gets turned 
off as described in the preceding bullet. (See Part III for more informa-
tion about reducing your computer’s energy use.)
 
✓ Devices that draw power even when they appear to be turned off: 
Unplug these “standby power” devices — which are also known as 
energy vampires — including TVs, stereos, and cell phone or iPod 
chargers.
 
 Plug energy vampires into a smart power strip, like the one shown in 
Figure 5-1, which senses the flow of electrical current through the strip’s 
control outlet, and turns off selected outlets when devices plugged into 
them are not in use. Doing so minimizes the energy draw and makes it 
easier to automatically pull the proverbial plug on devices that aren’t in 
use all at once.

Publishing). Some of the basic energy-saving principles in that book apply 
also to the powered devices in your home.

 Chapter 5: Energy Savings All Around the House
Reviewing Energy-Saving Opportunities 
in Your House
The biggest power-hungry, high-tech item in your house is probably the TV 
in your living room, followed by typically smaller sets in the bedroom, base-
ment, or den. Several other pieces of home entertainment gear — including 
DVD players, audio systems, and game controllers — are vying for power, 
too.
In this section, I take you on a quick tour of your household gadgets and 
offer quick fixes for green living, such as using smart power strips, along 
the way. In the later section “Adjusting Power-Saving Options on TVs and 
Entertainment Gear,” I detail which settings to look for and adjust to make 
your home gadgets more energy efficient.
Use a programmable thermostat — 
and then walk away
You can swap your manual thermostat with the 
Honeywell 5-2 Day Programmable Thermostat 
to set heating and cooling temperatures — and 
then forget them. Set this gadget to turn up the 
heating or air conditioning a few minutes before 
you wake up, adjust it downward when you 
head off to work, kick it up a few notches when 
you return home, and then adjust it again at 
bedtime for a night of sleep that’s comfortable 
and energy efficient. If you’re sleeping in on the 
weekend, setting the Honeywell device to keep 
you warm or cool beyond your usual wakeup 
time is par for the course.

78
Part II: Getting Green with Gadgets You Own 
Televisions
Older sets are less efficient than newer ones, and all of them are energy vam-
pires because they continue to draw power even when you switch them off. 
Some sip only a few watts when turned off — usually referred to as being in 
Standby mode — whereas others suck lots of juice in order to let you start 
watching almost immediately the next time you turn them on.
 
Replacing disposable, or single use, batteries with rechargeable ones in every 
remote control and other battery-operated gadget in your house is a supers-
mart, and supereasy, way to stop wasting energy, resources, and money. Read 
all about it in Chapter 3.
Energy monitors
If you’re wondering just how much power that 
room heater or printer, or any other electrically 
powered device, is drawing when it’s turned 
on — and when it’s turned off — plug it into the 
Kill A Watt, shown in the figure on the left. Then 
you can find out instantly how many watts it’s 
drawing — and how much it’s contributing to 
your monthly electric bill.
Skipping the plug-it-in approach is The Energy 
Detective, shown on the right, which taps 
directly into your home’s circuit breaker to 
display in real-time the total amount of power 
you’re using — and paying for. Turning appli-
ances and gadgets on and off reveals how 
much each one is adding to your overall load.

79
 Chapter 5: Energy Savings All Around the House
Plugging your TV into a power strip that you can turn off with the flick of a 
switch is an easy to way to cut down on not only its standby energy drain but 
also all the other gadgets typically plugged into your TV, including
 
✓ DVD and VHS players
 
✓ Video game consoles
 
✓ A/V receivers and surround-sound systems and the speakers connected 
to them
 
✓ Cable, satellite, and DVR devices, such as the TiVo
Choosing not to power off the trio of devices listed in the last bullet is under-
standable because they generally take a long time to start up again — and 
you run the chance of missing programs you want to record if they happen to 
air whenever your TiVo or DVR-enabled cable box is turned off.
 
Picking a smart power strip that combines several sockets that turn off at one 
time, or senses when a device isn’t in use, yet leaves a couple of sockets pow-
ered on, provides a fair compromise to the all-or-nothing approach of turning 
everything off.
Computers and peripheral devices
Your computer and any devices connected to it are popular at-home, power-
hungry culprits. If you use the same kind of smart power strip (refer to Figure 
5-1) for your computer and its peripherals, you can leave it up to the power 
strip to sense when to turn off some sockets while leaving a few turned on. 
This type of flexibility lets you completely shut down such standby power 
drainers as monitors and printers when you turn off your PC, while allowing 
typically always-on gadgets (such as broadband cable or DSL modems and 
home networking WiFi routers) to keep perking along without pause.
This is helpful if you or someone else in your house is tapping into the 
Internet wirelessly with a notebook computer or video game console in 
another room. If not, turning off your broadband modem and router rewards 
you with even greater savings. Adjusting your computer’s energy-saving set-
tings is covered from head to toe in Part III.
Mobile phones, MP3 players, GPS 
trackers, and other personal gadgets
Leaving the charger for your mobile phone, GPS tracker, iPod, Nintendo DS, 
or other portable gadget plugged in to the wall socket after it’s fully charged 
wastes energy.

80
Part II: Getting Green with Gadgets You Own 
 
Unplugging a charger after a gadget is fully charged saves energy because it 
stops the charger from wasting power by continually sipping juice even when 
it’s no longer thirsty.
Taking advantage of individual energy-saving options for each of your per-
sonal gadgets is described in Chapter 4.
Adjusting Power-Saving Options 
on TVs and Entertainment Gear
In this section, I provide several power-saving tips for TVs and other common 
home electronics devices. These tips, which can help you save energy and 
money, are aimed toward making gadgets you already own more green. If 
you’re interested in acquiring green home entertainment and other types of 
household gadgets, check out Chapter 13.
Taming TV power
Every TV in your house, whether it’s old or brand-spanking new, can use less 
energy when you pay attention to the practices and settings mentioned in the 
next several sections.
You usually access your TV’s settings by pressing one of the following but-
tons on your TV’s remote control or on the TV set itself:
 
✓ Menu
 
✓ Settings
 
✓ Setup
Understanding that off means off
Plugging your TV into a smart power strip, which I describe earlier in this 
chapter — or just pulling the plug when you’ll be away for more than a 
couple of days — cuts down on the power drain that a TV consumes when 
it’s left plugged in and in Standby mode.
Saying not-so-fast to Fast Start
If your newer hi-definition TV (HDTV) has either a Fast Start or Quick Start 
option, turning it off means waiting a little longer after turning the set on 
before you can start watching. When you avoid using this feature, the TV 
uses up to 50 percent less energy than it normally consumes in Standby 
mode.

81
 Chapter 5: Energy Savings All Around the House
Playing to an audience of none
Leaving the TV turned on when no one is watching it is wasteful. Sure, you 
can reasonably leave the room to grab a beverage or use the (ahem) facili-
ties, but turning off the tube if you won’t be back for more than a few minutes 
is the energy-saving thing to do.
Initiating sleepy-time savings
Falling to sleep with the TV on happens, of course, and using your TV remote 
control’s Sleep feature can ensure that your set sleeps as peacefully (and effi-
ciently) as you if you happen to nod off during a snoozer. The Sleep button 
generally offers shutoff timer choices that range from 15 minutes to an hour 
or more. Check to see whether your TV remote has a Sleep button, and if 
so, press it repeatedly to become familiar with your snooze-you-don’t-lose-
energy choices.
Dimming the lights
Reducing your TV’s brightness — and the brightness of the room you’re sit-
ting in when you’re watching — can go a long way toward increasing your 
energy savings.
To dim the lights, so to speak, make one of these four adjustments:
 
✓ Room lighting: The use of low-level backlighting or curtained but light-
allowing windows is easier on the eyes when viewing TV — and easier 
on the environment because you can dim your TV’s brightness, as 
described in the next bullet.
 
✓ Brightness and picture: Most TVs leave the factory with all their pic-
ture-related settings cranked to the maximum level in order to stand out 
among all the competitors vying to catch your eye on the showroom 
floor. Turning down your TV’s brightness setting increases your energy 
savings.
 
 Checking your TV’s settings to see whether it has picture presets — 
such as Movie, Sports, Natural, Action, or Game — is another option. 
Some models offer a Power Saver setting that’s generally the greenest 
choice you can make.
 
✓ LCD backlight: LCD flat-panel TVs typically offer a backlighting setting. 
The lower you set it, the less energy your set draws.
 
✓ Professional calibration: Consider hiring a professional TV technician 
to calibrate your higher-end HDTVs to provide picture-perfect perfor-
mance for the room you’re watching in. Your reward can be better sav-
ings — and greater viewing pleasure.

Benefitting from all-in-one remote controls
Replacing half a dozen (or more) remote controls with a rechargeable all-
in-one model, such as the Harmony One, shown in Figure 5-2, eliminates the 
need to buy lots of batteries — and reduces multiple carbon footprint con-
tributors in one fell swoop. I write more about the Harmony One remote in 
Chapter 3.
 
Figure 5-2: 
Replace 
many 
remote con-
trols with an

Reducing power consumption in DVD, 
video game, and other types of players
Adjusting your DVD or Blu-ray player’s power-saving settings can help you 
save energy long after the curtains have closed. You can also keep the sav-
ings in play after you play games or movies on your video game console, 
thanks to the auto-off options built into the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
DVD players
If you turn on your DVD or other player’s auto-off option after the movie or 
other program ends and displays the main menu, you can save energy in case 
you forget to turn off the player yourself — or if you fall asleep before the end 
of the show.
 
Display your DVD or other player’s settings by pressing a remote control 
button named Menu, Settings, or Setup.

83
 Chapter 5: Energy Savings All Around the House
VHS players
Activate the auto-off option on your VHS player, if it has one, so that the 
player cuts the power a set length of time after it senses that the tape has 
reached the end of the show.
Audio/video receivers and speaker systems
Booming bass surround-sound speaker systems are big-time energy drainers, 
and shutting them off or plugging them into a power strip can help increase 
your home entertainment system energy savings.
 
Plugging all the items connected to your audio/video (AV) receiver into its 
built-in switchable outlets can make it easier to turn everything on and off 
at one time — if your receiver is similar to the Yamaha RX-V2700, shown in 
Figure 5-3. It has two switchable power sockets for easier power-saving shut-
offs, located in the lower right corner of the device.
 
Figure 5-3:

able power

Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3
Activating the automatic power-off feature on your Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 
can help reduce your console’s energy consumption whenever you leave the 
game — and leave the game box on.
Neither the Xbox 360 or the PlayStation 3 (PS3) ships from the factory 
with the option turned on, which is why it’s up to you to make the change. 
Although Nintendo forgot to give its video game console, the Wii, any type 
of energy-saving settings, that doesn’t mean it can’t appear in a future down-
loadable update. (That’s the approach Sony took to give the PS3 an auto-off 
option, similar to the one on the Xbox 360.)
 
Plugging any video game console into a smart power strip and shutting off the 
power strip with everything else all at one time can help save energy that’s 
otherwise wasted by off-but-not-completely-off standby power drainers, such 
as the chunky power supply on the Xbox 360.

84
Part II: Getting Green with Gadgets You Own 
Granted, the Wii draws less than half the power of the Xbox 360 or PS3, but 
that doesn’t mean you should leave it on morning, noon, and night whether 
you’re playing or not.
Maybe you’re wondering just how much energy is wasted every year because 
of video game consoles. Researchers estimate that the total drain is about 
16 billion kilowatt hours per year or, put another way, “roughly equal to 
the annual electricity use of the city of San Diego.” To read more about this 
study, check out the nearby sidebar, “The great video-game-energy robbery.”
The great video-game-energy robbery
A study by the Natural Resources Defense 
Council, at www.nrdc.org/energy/
consoles/contents.asp, found that 
video game machines eat up “an estimated 
16 billion kilowatt hours per year,” which is 
“roughly equal to the annual electricity use of 
the city of San Diego.”
Gamers often leave consoles on when they’re 
not playing in order to return to the middle of 
a level that can’t be saved and reloaded in the 
same place if the power is turned off. Microsoft 
and Sony both offer options to automatically 
turn off the consoles after a set amount of time, 
but the study found that gamers often skip the 
option because they’ll lose their place if the 
game doesn’t have an auto-save or “save-any-
where” feature.
Games like the futuristic role-playing game 
BioShock offer the capability to save your prog-
ress in a game anywhere, anytime, to reload 
right where you left off after turning off the 
game machine and returning to it later.
Mr. Horowitz believes a Hibernate mode simi-
lar to what Windows and Mac computers have 
would save energy and save the player’s prog-
ress at the same time. When it came to locking 
in on how many gamers leave their machines 
on, Mr. Horowitz’s team could not offer an 
answer as to what percent. As such, the study 
group’s best guess is that about half of gamers 
leave their consoles running when they’re not 
playing.
The study found that the Wii draws 16 watts of 
power when it’s in use, while the Xbox 360 sits 
in the middle with a rating of 119 watts when 
it’s on and doing its gaming thing. Sucking up 
150 watts, the PS3 was the biggest energy con-
sumer of the group.
Citing the PS3’s main role as game machine, Mr. 
Horowitz said the console uses full power when 
it doesn’t need to, such as while playing a Blu-
ray DVD movie. Watching the movie Spider-Man 
3, Mr. Horowitz found that the game console 
used more than 120 watts of power. Comparing 
the PS3 to one of Sony’s standard Blu-ray play-
ers, Mr. Horowitz said the player uses five times 
less power than the PS3.
Hoping the study’s findings prompt the console 
makers to make their boxes more energy effi-
cient, Mr. Horowitz said the hibernation-like 
feature he described is doable, and if the manu-
facturers tried a little harder, they could fix it.

85
 Chapter 5: Energy Savings All Around the House
 
Turning off your Xbox 360 controller isn’t a big deal because it does it itself 
after sensing that you’re no longer using it. Not so with the PS3 controller — 
until you turn on its auto-off option.
To turn on the auto-off feature on your PlayStation 3 console and controller, 
follow these steps:
 
1. From the main menu, choose System Settings➪Power Save Settings 
and then press Select.
 
2. Select System Auto-Off and choose the number of hours your PS3 will 
wait when you’re not playing it before it shuts itself off. Then press 
Select.
 
 Your choices are 1, 2, 3, or 5 hours or Off. Choosing 1 hour is the green-
est choice for maximum energy savings.
 
3. Select the Turn Off System Automatically Even Under Special 
Conditions option and then select OK.
 
 The console turns itself off after the selected length of time even if a game 
or Blu-ray disc is inserted in the console and the main menu is displayed.
 
 Leaving this option deselected prevents the console from turning itself 
off when you’re watching a movie, playing a game, or just letting the con-
sole sit idle on the main menu.
 
4. Return to the Power Save Settings screen and select Controller Auto-
Off.
 
 This step governs the controller’s ability to toggle its power on or off 
whenever it detects that you’re no longer playing with it.
To turn on your Xbox 360 auto-off feature:
 
1. Press the Xbox controller’s center X button, then navigate to 
Settings➪System Settings➪Console Settings➪Shutdown.
 
2. Choose Auto-Off➪Enable.
 
 Your Xbox 360 turns itself off after six hours of inactivity, as shown in 
Figure 5-4.
 
3. (Optional) Select Background Downloads.
 
 After you turn off the console, the system completes any downloads that 
it put on hold while you were playing a game or watching a movie.

Minimizing Your 
Computer’s Carbon 
Footprint

In this part . . .
M
inimizing your computer’s carbon footprint might 
sound daunting, but it’s easier than most people 
realize. You have to roll up your sleeves and venture into 
parts of your system that you might have never seen. I 
provide step-by-step directions to help you do it, and 
before you know it, you’ll tweak energy settings that leave 
you with a system that draws the least amount of power 
necessary when you’re using it and draws little or no 
power when you’re not using it.

Chapter 6
Your Computer’s Energy Use
In This Chapter
▶ Debunking what you know about your computer’s power consumption
▶ Determining your computer’s energy needs
▶ Adjusting computer energy-saving settings
▶ Finding energy vampires among your peripheral devices
P
Cs use a lot of energy, yet most people admit that they use their com-
puters only half the time it’s turned on (or even less). Adjusting your 
computer’s power-saving settings to minimize energy consumption is an easy — 
and easily overlooked — way to reduce your personal carbon footprint.
 
Reducing your computer’s power consumption increases your personal sav-
ings, knocking an average of $25 to $75 off your annual electric bill.
In this chapter, I discuss the general ins and outs of computer power con-
sumption. I also briefly touch on how to adjust energy settings for your 
printer, monitor, and other peripherals. The results are beneficial to the 
planet — and your bank account. In the next two chapters, I discuss how to 
set specific adjustments for Windows computers (see Chapter 7) and Macs 
(see Chapter 8).
Quashing Computer Power Myths
Adjusting your computer’s power settings for the largest possible energy 
savings is easier when you understand how much energy a PC consumes to 
start up, shut down, “nap” in Standby mode or Sleep mode, or power off com-
pletely with the deeper-sleep power-saving option known as Hibernate.
Plugging your computer and peripherals into a “smart” power strip such 
as the Belkin Conserve, shown in Figure 6-1, can take a bite out of energy 
vampires by reducing or completely cutting power consumption and costs. 
(See Chapter 1 for more about energy vampires.) If you have to bend over to 
reach a power strip that’s on the floor or tucked behind your desk, you might 

90
Part III: Minimizing Your Computer’s Carbon Footprint 
not bother turning power strips off. Enter the Conserve’s handy remote con-
trol — press it to instantly turn on or off all of the devices plugged into eight 
of the strip’s ten outlets. The remaining pair of outlets stays on all of the time 
so that you can keep certain devices (such as your cable or DSL modem and 
Wi-Fi router) on around the clock.
 
Figure 6-1: 
Stop suck-
ing power 
from your 
devices 
by using a

strip.
 
Playing a quick round of True or False can help you understand the ins and 
outs of PC power use while dispelling a couple of longstanding myths:
 
✓ Shutting down your PC and turning it on again the next time you use 
it consumes more power than leaving the computer on most of the 
time.
 
 False. A computer uses less energy to boot up and operate as needed 
than it does to leave it on all the time.
 
✓ Screen savers save energy.
 
 False. Setting your computer’s energy-saving setting to turn off your 
monitor or notebook display rather than run a screen saver saves 
energy. Running a pretty 3D screen saver, such as Bubbles, shown in 
Figure 6-2, not only keeps the juice flowing to the screen but also might 
require the computer’s graphics card to use more power because it’s 
working harder to render the 3D animated scene.
 
✓ Screen savers prevent screen burn-in.
 
 True and false. It’s true that older TV-like cathode ray tube (CRT) moni-
tors suffered from image burn-in. Burn-in (also referred to as screen fade 
or phosphor burn) describes what happens when a screen is left on for 
hours at a stretch: Menu bars or the logo of a news channel, for exam-
ple, leave a permanent shadow on the screen.

91
 Chapter 6: Your Computer’s Energy Use
 
Figure 6-2: 
The Bubbles

saver in 
Windows 
Vista is 
pretty but 
also power-
hungry.
 
 
 Running a screen saver on older CRTs can prevent burn-in — as does 
changing the energy settings to shut off the monitor after a certain 
amount of time. It’s false, though, to suggest that a screen saver pre-
vents burn-in on a notebook or computer with a liquid crystal display 
(LCD), because the technology that’s used is impervious to the burn-in 
bummers of yore.
 
✓ Computers use less energy when they’re idling.
 
 True and false. Like cars, computers generally use less energy when 
they’re just sitting there, not distracted by your fingertips or mouse 
clicks. But the same idling computer may be using more energy if it’s 
running a graphically intensive program or downloading a huge file in 
the background. Many manufacturers now strive to cut idling energy 
consumption by half or more. For instance, at the time this book was 
written, the “greenest MacBook ever” from Apple used one-quarter of 
the power of an ordinary 60-watt light bulb when idling.
Picture this: In a perfectly energy-conscious world, your computer is fully 
powered on and running at a level of performance that suits your needs; 
when your computer isn’t in use, it’s dozing but ready to awaken instantly or 
in mere seconds when you return to it. Better yet, your computer awakens a 
minute or so before you sit down with your preferred beverage at the start 
of every workday; naps while you’re at lunch and awakens just before you 
return; and thoughtfully remembers to shut itself off a few minutes after your 
typical quitting time, in case you forget to “pull the plug” yourself. In fact, 
your perfectly energy-conscious computer is so energy-savings-savvy that it 

92
Part III: Minimizing Your Computer’s Carbon Footprint 
even knows not to wake itself until noon on weekends because that’s when 
you typically check your weekend e-mail and it’s smart enough to put itself 
to sleep or completely shut down if you don’t even check in, which saves the 
largest possible amount of energy.
My description sounds like a science fiction dream, doesn’t it? It’s not, 
because it can all be done right now, thanks to automated power schedul-
ers, such as the one built into the Mac’s Energy Saver preferences, shown in 
Figure 6-3.
 
Figure 6-3: 
Scheduling 
your Mac 
to automati-
cally start 
up and shut 
down.
 
Okay, in a more perfect world, perhaps your computer will be so smart that 
rather than rely on an energy settings schedule that you set up, built-in sen-
sors will detect when you’re out of bed and wake the computer at the same 
time, and other sensors will listen for such phrases as “I’m heading to lunch,” 
giving the computer permission to take a nap until it senses your return.
In the meantime, setting your computer’s energy settings to respond to your 
work and play needs on a strict day-to-day basis — or in a manner that’s 
more relaxed and generally eco-aware — is a cinch after you have a better 
handle on your true computer usage and consumption habits and routines.

93
 Chapter 6: Your Computer’s Energy Use
Evaluating Your Everyday 
Computer Needs
Getting a handle on how you use your computer on a daily, nightly, and week-
end basis is the first step to creating a friendlier energy-saving relationship 
with your computer — and with the environment. You can calculate the esti-
mated energy usage of your home computer (and other electronic devices) 
in dollars and cents — a task that’s made easy when you use an energy cal-
culator like the Web-based offering at http://mygreenelectronics.org. 
If number crunching is your preferred way of doing business, download the 
free energy calculator spreadsheet available at www.energystar.gov.
You must consider the kinds of tasks you use your computer for to help 
determine which settings to adjust to give back positive energy — and costs 
savings — without negatively affecting your workflow or your computer’s 
performance (and by extension, your own).
This list highlights which tasks require the most power and speed and which 
ones are relatively easy on a computer’s resources:
 
✓ Video editing: If you have a Mac and you’re using a program such as 
Final Cut to edit video, you need all the power and speed the machine 
can provide. Turning down settings that affect performance isn’t an 
option, however, because the computer’s main central processing unit 
(CPU), graphics processing unit (GPU), and hard drive must work fast 
and furiously to capture the necessary number of video frames to make 
movies and broadcast-quality video look natural to viewers.
 
✓ Photo editing, uploading, and so on: To your computer, a picture is a 
data file made up of thousands to millions and millions of bits of data. 
Keeping a handle on all of those millions of dots (or pixels), and render-
ing each new view after you make changes, pushes your computer’s 
processors and hard drive to the max. Uploading your pictures or 
illustrations to Facebook or e-mailing them to family and friends, on the 
other hand, isn’t too taxing on your computer’s electronic brain.
 
✓ Any tasks that require specialized applications: Using computers to 
perform complicated tasks such as editing feature films, playing ultrar-
ealistic video games, or analyzing DNA chains in 3D (I made that one up, 
but you get the idea) are considered specialized applications and there-
fore require computers to run at their maximum performance level to 
process all the data that’s involved.
 
✓ Word processing and/or number crunching (in a spreadsheet pro-
gram): These everyday tasks are in the category of general computing, 
which are tasks that generally access the hard drive only when saving 
(or autosaving) a document or looking up a word in the thesaurus, for 
example.

94
Part III: Minimizing Your Computer’s Carbon Footprint 
 
✓ Web browsing: This is also mainly a light-duty task for your computer’s 
processing brains, requiring the machine’s brawnier browsing powers 
on an as-needed basis, such as when visiting sites loaded with tons of 
design gizmos and animated graphics or video.
 
No matter what you do with your computer — calculating rocket science or 
playing solitaire — it’s always smart to turn it off when you’re not using it.
Setting a reliable energy-saving schedule and scheme is generally easier if 
you adhere to a strict schedule. Even so, no law specifies that if you’re keep-
ing a strict schedule, you must set your computer’s energy settings to turn 
on and off at the same time every day, or at different times on the weekend.
 
Setting even the most basic energy-saving settings reduces your personal 
carbon footprint. For example, you might make the display turn off automati-
cally after you’re away from the computer for several minutes, followed by 
switching to Sleep mode or Standby mode a little later, and then powering off 
if you’re not back within an hour.
If you’re like most people, you probably travel to an office or other out-of-
the-house workplace. That means your computer doesn’t belong to you, and 
maybe your company doesn’t allow employees to fiddle with certain settings. 
If you work for this type of company, you might change your bosses’ minds 
if you can help them understand that the settings you want to adjust to con-
serve energy also save the company’s money. Whose boss wouldn’t love that 
result? 
Understanding Computer 
Energy-Saving Settings
Adjusting how much power your computer consumes depends on the brand, 
model, and platform.
Knowing the difference between Standby, Sleep, and Hibernate modes — and 
any other power-conservation variables you might hear your friends and 
neighbors bandying about — goes a long way toward increasing your energy 
savings and your savings account. So without further adieu, here’s a quick-
and-dirty primer on computer power-saving modes:
 
✓ Sleep/Standby: This mode is called Sleep on the Mac and Standby in 
Windows. Activating either turns off the screen and hard drive and most 
of the power to the processor and memory while continuing to sip just 
enough juice to wake the computer instantly at the touch of a key or 
click of the mouse.

95
 Chapter 6: Your Computer’s Energy Use
 
✓ Hibernation: In Windows, Hibernate mode is a selectable option that 
saves to the hard disk the state of all running programs and open docu-
ments before completely powering off the computer. The Mac has 
no Hibernate option to do the same. Translation: You have no way to 
explicitly order your Mac to shut down completely and then power on 
and resume where you left off, as you can in Windows. Sorry, Mac fans!
 
✓ Safe Sleep: Putting a Mac to sleep does in fact copy all the contents of 
memory to the hard drive as a safety measure in case the desktop’s 
power is cut off or the notebook’s battery runs down or is removed 
before being plugged back into a power outlet. Apple calls this nicely 
integrated feature Safe Sleep.
 
 
If you’re a Mac techie-type who’s comfortable running system com-
mands in the Terminal program, you can find out how to force the Mac 
to always hibernate and shut down when it’s put to sleep by issuing the 
commands in the nearby sidebar, “Shut ’er down, Mac!”
 
✓ Hybrid Sleep: This Windows Vista setting works like Safe Sleep mode on 
the Mac, by copying the contents of open programs and documents to 
the hard drive before putting the computer to sleep, where they’re safe 
and sound in the event of a power failure or drained battery.
So you can see how the two platforms (Windows and Mac) are similar in that 
both offer Standby/Sleep and Hibernate modes, yet how you invoke the com-
pletely powered off Hibernate mode demonstrates how they differ.
Considerations beyond platform and operating system version (Windows 
Vista and XP have their own standby and hibernation differences that also 
determine a computer’s energy-saving features and adjustable settings) 
include whether your computer is equipped with any of these features:
 
✓ Energy Star or EPEAT ratings, or both, and if so, to what level of compli-
ance (see Chapter 1)
 
✓ A preloaded, custom power-management program to enhance, extend, 
or simplify making adjustments to the operating system’s standard 
energy option settings (Windows only)
 
✓ A CPU specifically engineered to consume less power
 
✓ Built-in ambient light sensors that monitor room lighting to automati-
cally brighten or dim the display and, if equipped, the keyboard back-
lighting brightness
 
✓ Additional powered hardware such as WiFi, Bluetooth, or power-
adjustable graphics processor or card

96
Part III: Minimizing Your Computer’s Carbon Footprint 
Basic energy-saving settings available on all Mac and Windows computers 
include the ability to adjust how long (and whether) the computer is allowed 
to sit doing nothing before it:
 
✓ Activates a screen saver or blanks the display.
 
✓ Dims or puts the display in Standby (also known as Sleep) mode, but 
doesn’t put the computer in Standby or Sleep mode.
 
✓ Puts the display and computer in Sleep or Standby mode.
 
✓ Puts the hard disk to sleep.
 
✓ Senses whether, in the case of notebooks, the computer is plugged in or 
running on battery juice, and switches above settings accordingly, based 
on user’s power source preferences.
Birth, death, taxes and basic energy-saving settings are all you can count 
on, and now that you’re in tune with the main points, let’s change the world 
one PC at a time by adjusting your own computer’s power settings for 
greater energy efficiency. How you’ll change your computer’s energy settings 
depends on how much control you want to gain.
Shut ’er down, Mac!
Apple sets its Macs to Safe Sleep mode by 
default, which means that your Mac goes to 
sleep and awakens almost instantly. Also, if 
your notebook battery dies or you accidentally 
kick out the power cord on your desktop, the 
next time you power on your Mac, it reawakens 
exactly where you left it, with all your programs 
open to exactly where you left them.
In Safe Sleep mode, your Mac doesn’t shut 
down completely — which explains why it 
reawakens so quickly — but maybe you want it 
to power off completely to use less energy and 
save more money on your electric bill. Keep 
in mind that a Mac, when awakened, takes 
longer (like a Windows computer) to return 
from Hibernate mode than when it’s awakened 
from Standby mode (Windows) or typical Sleep 
mode (Mac).
To shut down your desktop or notebook Mac 
when you put it to sleep and it’s plugged in or 
running on the battery, launch the Terminal 
application and enter the following line:
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 1
To hibernate your notebook Mac only while 
it’s running from the battery but not when 
it’s plugged in, type the following command 
instead:
sudo pmset -b hibernatemode 1
To restore your Mac to the default Safe Sleep 
mode, type 3 rather than 1.

 Chapter 6: Your Computer’s Energy Use
Changing your computer’s energy 
settings the easy way
If applying energy-saving settings with an easy-to-use utility or widget sounds 
more appealing than getting down and dirty with all your computer’s power 
settings, you’ve come to the right place. This section offers a quick tour of 
several easy-to-use power management utilities and widgets that take the 
guesswork out of adjusting your computer’s energy settings. Downloading 
one or more of these helpers lets you “set it and forget it.”
Tables 6-1, 6-2, and 6-3 show a few of my favorite add-ons for monitoring,

Taking greater control of your 
computer’s energy settings
When you adjust Mac and Windows energy-saving settings, the goal is the 
same — to achieve a good balance of power savings without sacrificing 
performance. The steps you take vary from platform to platform and in 
Windows, from version to version. In this section, I discuss the myriad ways 
you can adjust your computer’s energy-saving options.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) suggests setting your computer 
to enter either Standby mode or Hibernate mode after 15 to 60 minutes of 
inactivity, and for monitors to enter Sleep mode after 5 to 20 minutes of 
inactivity.
Mac folks like to remind Windows users how much simpler it is to do things 
the Mac way over “that other way” of computing. Well-versed Windows 
types, on the other hand, like to point out the wider range of choices and 
options in Windows — even if all that flexibility can sometimes cause 
confusion.
My MacBook is my main machine, and I usually have one or more Windows 
PCs on hand for review or to serve a particular project — or simply because 
I’m always curious about other ways of doing things, including dabbling with 
Ubuntu Linux now and then.

Because I’m familiar with both Mac and Windows PC energy-saving settings 
and options, it’s fair to say that each side has its pluses and minuses. The 
Mac’s settings are supereasy to figure out, though I wish that the Mac offered 
a way to easily force it into “deep sleep” Hibernate mode. As for Windows, I 
like its ability to create a custom power scheme (in Windows XP) or power 
plan (in Windows Vista) to best suit my energy needs, depending on what I’m 
working on — or not working on.
 
Although this chapter and the next two talk mainly about your computer’s 
power-management settings, those settings aren’t the only ones you should 
think about. Disconnecting, adjusting, or disabling other connected or built-in 
devices can further reduce consumption — and extend battery life between 
visits to the wall outlet if your computer is a notebook. Key power-drainers to 
shut off or disconnect when you’re not using them include the ones in this list:
 
✓ Bluetooth
 
✓ External hard drives
 
✓ Sound
 
✓ Wireless networking (WiFi)

101
 Chapter 6: Your Computer’s Energy Use
In Chapters 7 and 8, I show you how to disable these energy-zapping devices — 
and how to squelch a few not-so-obvious power-hogging features you might not 
know about.
 
Turning off your screen saver and setting your monitor to shut off after a few 
minutes — right now, before you do anything else — earns you instant kudos 
from Mother Nature. Think globally, act locally!
iPods, Printers, Hard Drives, and 
Other Connected Devices
In Chapter1, I explain how leaving cellphone chargers and other devices 
plugged in when you’re not using them wastes energy. The same explanation 
holds true for your Mac or Windows computer: Leaving a fully charged iPod, 
iPhone, cellphone, digital camera, or most any other rechargeable device 
plugged in wastes energy. Although a few gadgets have smart charging sen-
sors to turn themselves off, most don’t — yet.
 
Make a habit of plugging rechargeable gadgets into your computer only when 
they need charging or when you intend to use them — such as when you want 
to sync your iPod with your MP3 music or movies using iTunes, or import pic-
tures from your digital camera to Windows Photo Gallery — and then unplug 
them when you’re done.
Here are four examples of potential energy-sucking “vampires” connected to 
my computer:
 
✓ iPhone 3G: I connect this device only when I’m charging it or syncing it 
with iTunes.
 
✓ iPod nano: Ditto.
 
✓ LaCie portable USB hard drive: I use this drive to shuttle large numbers 
of files between my computers. I don’t need to do it all the time, so I 
unplug the drive when I’m not using it.
 
✓ Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000: My beloved digital rodent 
is always on when I’m working. When I’m not working, it puts itself 
into energy-saving Sleep mode or I power it off completely by using the 
switch on its underbelly.
 
If unplugging certain devices — such as printers, network routers, and backup 
hard drives — isn’t an option, inspect each one to see whether it offers power-
reducing options.

102
Part III: Minimizing Your Computer’s Carbon Footprint 
Here are three examples of power-saving options built into my own comput-
ing gear:
 
✓ A three-year-old Brother HL-2070N laser printer has a Sleep Time 
option that powers down the printer five minutes after I print. The 
printer also offers toner cartridge savings options, such as the ability 
to print at a lower resolution, and Toner Saver mode, which uses half 
the normal amount of toner when the feature is turned on. You adjust 
the Toner Saver mode and Sleep Time settings by using the Printing 
Preferences control panel.
 
✓ A Western Digital 150GB hard drive backs up my MacBook every 
hour, thanks to the Mac’s awesomely useful Time Machine backup 
program. Like my printer, the hard drive has a sleep function that 
spins down the drive and powers it off after a specified number of min-
utes. Accessing this option works only when the drive is connected 
to Windows computers, so I can’t use it. Then again, Time Machine 
accesses the drive every hour anyway, and although the drive doesn’t 
power off completely, it stops spinning after Time Machine finishes 
backing up any changes on my Mac that occurred since the previous 
backup, an hour earlier.
 
✓ An Xbox 360 streams music and video from my computer to my HDTV, 
with the help of the cool program Connect360 (www.nullriver.com/
products/connect360). Though I turn on my Xbox 360 only when I’m 
playing a game, watching movies, or streaming music and video from 
my Mac, I mention it here to point out the console’s energy-saving auto-
shutdown option. It’s the same for my PlayStation 3. To find out how to 
adjust your video game console’s energy-saving settings — and power-
saving features for your TV, DVD player, cable or satellite TV box, and 
other home entertainment devices — check out Chapter 13.

Chapter 7
Reducing Energy Consumption 
in Windows
In This Chapter
▶ Saving money with energy conservation
▶ Minimizing Windows energy use on-the-fly
▶ Adjusting the Windows automatic Power Options settings
▶ Making additional adjustments to the Windows Power Options
You aren’t one of those people who uses your computer only one-quarter 
of the time it’s turned on, are you? I didn’t think so. You’re one of those 
people who wants to reduce your computer’s carbon footprint as much as 
possible, and you’ve come to the right chapter. Adjusting your Windows 
computer’s power-saving options is fairly easy, and you can generally choose 
one of these four methods (all of which I explain further throughout this 
chapter):
 
✓ On-the-fly: Choosing on- the- fly options are those that you can change 
quickly and easily, such as pressing the power button on your desktop 
computer to shut it down, or closing the lid on your notebook computer 
to put it in Standby — also known as Sleep — mode).
 
✓ Automatically: Choosing one of the Windows preconfigured energy-
saving settings — known as Windows Vista power plans, or Windows 
XP power schemes — tells the computer to make certain energy-saving 
changes and to take action based on general usage scenarios.
 
✓ Customized: Modifying an existing power plan or creating a new one 
tailored to your specific needs gives you greater control over when and 
how Windows activates individual energy-saving modes.
 
✓ Specialized: Running a power management utility preloaded on your 
computer by the manufacturer — or running one of several power utili-
ties and widgets you can download — is the fourth way to minimize your 
computer’s power consumption, as I describe in Chapter 6.

104
Part III: Minimizing Your Computer’s Carbon Footprint 
 
 
Preloaded energy-saving utilities generally aim to take the guesswork 
out of tweaking the Windows Power Options control panel settings. 
Some or all of the categories mentioned in the preceding list are called 
into play when running a specialized or add-on energy-saving program 
or widget. Not all computers come with specialized power-management 
programs, such as the Power Manager that Lenovo ships with the 
ThinkPad X200s notebook, shown in Figure 7-1.
Making other adjustments — such as disabling Bluetooth and wireless net-
working features if you’re not using them — also helps reduce your com-
puter’s carbon footprint. I describe making these energy-saving adjustments 
and others in the section “Making Additional Windows Vista and XP Power 
Options Adjustments,” later in this chapter.
Note: Although Windows 7 was not shipping when I wrote this, I did run the 
prerelease beta version of the operating system; Microsoft has been burning 
the midnight oil to improve its newest operating system’s energy efficiency 
Making ¢ents of power-saving options
According to the government-backed program 
Energy Star, you can shave as much as $75 
annually from your electric bill by choosing the 
right Windows energy-saving settings. This list 
gives you a quick rundown of the key Windows 
power options — it describes what they do and 
how much they can save you:
Hibernate
 ✓ Drops monitor and computer power use to 
1 to 3 watts apiece
 ✓ Wakes after 20 seconds or more
 ✓ Saves work in the event of power loss
 ✓ Saves $25 to $75 per PC annually
Standby
 ✓ Drops monitor and computer power use to 
1 to 3 watts apiece
 ✓ Wakes in seconds
 ✓ Saves $25 to $75 per PC annually
Turn Off Hard Disk
 ✓ Saves little energy
Turn Off Monitor
 ✓ Drops monitor power use to 1 to 3 watts
 ✓ Wakes in seconds or less
 ✓ Saves half as much as system Standby 
or Hibernate, or about $10 to $40 per PC 
annually

105
 Chapter 7: Reducing Energy Consumption in Windows
smarts beyond all versions that came before it. The improvements are mainly 
under-the-hood, and I’m happy to report that accessing and adjusting the 
Windows 7 power options are nearly identical to doing so in Windows Vista, 
which I describe in the following sections. To read more about how Windows 
7 pulls off its better energy-saving abilities, check out the product design 
group’s blog (Engineering Windows 7) at http://blogs.msdn.com/e7.
 
To follow the step-by-step instructions in this chapter, open Classic View in 
the Windows computer’s Control Panel. With Classic View turned on, we’re 
both on the same page, so to speak, which means you won’t stumble when 
following how-to steps. To turn on Classic View, choose Start➪Control Panel, 
and then click Classic View, as shown in Figure 7-2.

Minimizing Windows Energy 
Use On-the-Fly
Minimizing your Windows computer’s energy consumption on-the-fly is a 
no-brainer: On Windows XP, click the Start button and then the red Power 
button (Shut Down). Clicking the Power button opens a dialog box to let 
you choose whether to put the computer in Sleep or Hibernate mode (hold 
down the shift key to see that option) or power it off, depending on how the 
Windows XP Power Options are set.
If you’re running Windows Vista, clicking the Power button carries out what-
ever action you assign it (which I show you in this chapter). Clicking Start 
and the right arrow next to the Lock icon opens a fly-out menu with options 
to Switch User, Log Off, Lock the computer, Restart, Sleep, or Shut Down.
Here are some other ways to activate the Windows energy-saving features, 
which I describe in more detail in the next section:
 
✓ Close the lid on your Windows notebook: You can put it in Sleep, 
Hibernate, or Shut Down mode, based on which option you select in the 
Power Options control panel.

107
 Chapter 7: Reducing Energy Consumption in Windows
 
✓ Press your computer’s power button: You’re prompted to suspend, 
shut down, or hibernate — or the action automatically completes based 
on whether one is chosen in the Power Options control panel.
 
✓ Press the Fn key and another, assigned key: This combination puts the 
computer in Suspend mode or Hibernate mode.
 
✓ Press a special button to instantly switch power-saving modes: This 
button is available only on certain computers.
 
Pressing the power switch to turn off your Windows desktop computer’s 
external monitor is another easy way to blank the screen and save energy 
when you leave your computer for more than a few minutes — unless, or 
course, your PC is an all-in-one model with a built-in display.
Adjusting the Windows Automatic 
Power Options Settings
Performing the smartest energy-saving actions need not rest on your shoul-
ders alone. Letting your computer remember for you is easy — all it takes are 
a few simple adjustments to the Power Options control panel. You change 
the power options — such as how long your computer waits before it turns 
off the display, powers off the hard disk, or enters Standby or Hibernate 
mode — by using the Power Options control panel.
Note: Many of the following options are based on notebook settings. You can 
ignore those instances if you’re using a desktop computer because they don’t 
apply to you.
To open the Windows power options, click the Start button and then choose 
Control Panel➪Power Options.
Choosing a preconfigured power plan in the center of the Power Options con-
trol panel is just a click away. As Figure 7-3 shows, Windows Vista comes with 
three preconfigured power plans.
 
Your computer may have additional power plan choices that may be ordered 
differently from the ones you see in Figure 7-3 and other figures in this 
chapter.
If you’re running Vista, clicking the Change Plan Settings link beneath each of 
the power plans shows you what each one tells your computer to do after the 
computer is idle for specified stretches of time (see Figure 7-4.)

If you’re running Windows XP, clicking the individual drop-down menus 
in the settings section lets you adjust how much time passes before your 
computer turns off the monitor and hard disk, or switches it into Standby or 
Hibernate mode, if your computer supports hibernation.

109
 Chapter 7: Reducing Energy Consumption in Windows
 
To quickly change power plans and keep tabs on your Windows notebook’s 
battery level, click the battery or power icon in the Task Bar (as shown in 
Figure 7-5). If you don’t see the battery or power icon in your Task Bar, you 
can turn it on:
 
✓ Windows Vista: Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Taskbar and Start Menu, 
and then select the Power check box under the System Icons section.
 
✓ Windows XP: Click Start➪Control Panel➪Power Options, then click the 
Advanced tab and click the checkbox Always Show Icon on the Task Bar.

Choosing and customizing Windows 
Vista’s power plans
The Windows Vista power plan settings (refer to Figure 7-3) for running your 
notebook on battery power are
 
✓ Balanced: Turns off the display after 5 minutes, puts the computer in 
Sleep mode after 15 minutes, and automatically reduces the screen 
brightness. When your notebook is plugged in, its display is set to maxi-
mum brightness and goes dark after 20 minutes. After an hour, it enters 
Sleep mode.
 
✓ Power Saver: Turns off its display after 3 minutes, puts the computer 
in Sleep mode after 15 minutes, and automatically reduces the screen 
brightness even more than the Balanced setting does. When your note-
book is plugged in, its display is set to maximum brightness and goes 
dark after 20 minutes. After an hour, the computer enters Sleep mode.

110
Part III: Minimizing Your Computer’s Carbon Footprint 
 
✓ High Performance: Turns up the brightness setting on the display, turns 
it off after 20 minutes, and puts the computer in Sleep mode after an 
hour. When the notebook is plugged in, it’s also set to maximum bright-
ness, goes dark after 20 minutes, and is set to never enter Sleep mode.
The power options listed on the left side of the control panel are the follow-
ing (refer to Figure 7-3):
 
✓ Require a Password on Wakeup: Prompts you to type in your password 
when your computer wakes from Sleep or Hibernate mode.
 
✓ Choose What the Power Button Does: Prompts Windows to take an 
action after you press your computer’s power button, such as to power 
it off or put it in Suspend or Hibernate mode.
 
✓ Choose What Closing the Lid Does: Prompts the same actions as for the 
preceding option, but occurs when you close the lid of your notebook 
computer.
 
✓ Create a Power Plan: Enables you to create and save a power plan that 
you can easily switch to without having to re-create the settings all over 
again.
 
✓ Choose When to Turn Off the Display: Determines how much time will 
elapse when you’re not using the computer before it turns off the screen.
 
✓ Change When the Computer Sleeps: Determines how much time will 
elapse when you’re not using the computer before it puts the system in 
Sleep mode.
 
✓ Adjust the Display Brightness: Adjusts your screen’s level of brightness.
Choosing one of the first three options opens the Power Options System 
Settings control panel, shown in Figure 7-6.
Under Power and Sleep Buttons and Lid Settings (refer to Figure 7-6), choose 
which energy-saving action your computer will take while it’s running on bat-
tery and while it’s plugged in. Your choices are
 
✓ Do Nothing: Exactly what it says.
 
✓ Sleep: Puts your computer in energy-saving Sleep mode.
 
✓ Hibernate: Puts your computer into more efficient energy-saving mode.
 
✓ Shut Down: Powers off your computer.
Under Password Protection on Wakeup (refer to Figure 7-6), if the Require a 
Password (Recommended) option is grayed-out, click Change Settings That 
Are Currently Unavailable. When the permissions alert appears, as shown 
in Figure 7-7, click Continue. Now you can select the Require a Password 
option and click the Save Changes button. From now on, your computer 
prompts you for your password whenever it awakens from either Standby or 
Hibernate mode.

Creating a new power plan rather than changing one of the ready-to-go 
choices is another option. To do so, click the Create a Power Plan link (in the 
main Power Options control panel; refer to Figure 7-3), and then follow the 
prompts to choose the power options that best match your needs.

Choosing and Customizing Windows 
XP Power Schemes
Running Windows XP on a notebook? If so, you’ll see two columns of options 
in the middle of the Power Options Properties control panel — Plugged in 
and Running on batteries — as shown in Figure 7-9. Windows XP desktop 
users will see only one set of options.
Starting with the first tab — Power Schemes — and working to the right, 
here’s a rundown of Windows XP’s Power Options settings.

Power Schemes
Choosing a preset energy setting Power Scheme to match your Windows XP 
computer’s usage is easy: Simply click the drop-down menu to the right of 
the Power Schemes list and pick the one that closely matches your kind of 
computer usage.
Notice how each one changes the settings time limits listed in the lower half 
of the Power Options Properties control panel. Choices include:
 
✓ Home/Office Desk: Shuts off the display after 20 minutes when plugged 
in, and after 5 minutes when running on batteries. Doesn’t turn off the 
hard disk or go into Standby or Hibernate mode when plugged in, but 
does all three when running on a notebook’s battery.
 
✓ Portable/Laptop: Greener than Home/Office for both desktops or note-
books because it turns off the display and hard disks after several min-
utes, and also puts the computer in Standby mode and then Hibernate 
mode.
 
✓ Presentation: Choose this if your notebook is plugged in and you’re 
giving a presentation but don’t want the screen to go blank while you’re 
pausing to expound on a particular slide. When running on batteries, 
the screen will stay on for up to 15 minutes before the system goes into 
Standby mode.
 
✓ Always On: Not green, but definitely the one to choose if you’re play-
ing an action game or running a complicated graphics or video-editing 
program. Just remember to switch to one of the greener schemes when 
you’re done playing!

115
 Chapter 7: Reducing Energy Consumption in Windows
 
✓ Minimal Power Management: Greener than Always On, with reasonably 
accommodating stretches of time before the monitor and hard disk shut 
off; the computer goes into Standby mode after one hour.
 
✓ Max Battery: A good choice for on-the-go notebook users because it 
blanks the screen after 1 minute, spins down the hard disk after 3 min-
utes, and (inexplicably) goes into Standby mode after 2 minutes, which 
means that the hard disk will enter Sleep mode then as well, rather than 
wait 3 minutes to do so.
Changing the individual time limits and actions for each scheme allows you 
to tailor a Power Scheme to suit your unique computer usage style. Choices 
include
 
✓ Turn Off Monitor
 
✓ Turn Off Hard Disks
 
✓ System Standby
 
✓ System Hibernates
 
After making changes to a Power Scheme, click Save As to save your custom 
settings so you can select them again if you change schemes. Name it what-
ever you like — Joe’s Ultimate Power Scheme has a nice ring to it, don’t you 
think?
Alarms
Adjusting the options on the Alarms tab tells your notebook to shout out 
when its battery is running (almost) on empty (see Figure 7-10).

116
Part III: Minimizing Your Computer’s Carbon Footprint 
Drag the sliders left and right to determine just how low the battery is 
allowed to go before warning you the party’s almost over and you need to 
plug into a power outlet soon before your notebook shuts itself off.
Click the Alarm Actions buttons to choose what kind of wake up call you 
prefer. Choices include:
 
✓ Sound Alarm
 
✓ Display Message
 
✓ When the alarm goes off, the computer will:
 
• Stand By
 
• Hibernate
 
• Shut Down
 
✓ Force Stand By or Shutdown Even If a Program Stops Responding
 
✓ When the Alarm Occurs, Run This Program
Power Meter
Select the Show Details for Each Battery option if your notebook has more 
than one battery; otherwise, leave it deselected to see how much juice is 
available when you’re not plugged into a power outlet — and how much 
more juice the battery needs when you’re plugged in and recharging.
Advanced
Clicking or changing the Advanced options tells your Windows XP notebook 
computer to
 
✓ Always Show Icon on the Taskbar: Handy for keeping visual tabs on 
your notebook’s remaining battery level or changing power schemes.
 
✓ Prompt for Password When Computer Resumes from Standby: 
Definitely something you’ll want to turn on if you don’t want coworkers 
snooping around your computer while you’re out to lunch!
 
✓ Power Buttons: Here’s where you pick automatic power-saving options 
that tell your Windows XP notebook what to do when you choose one of 
these options:
 
• Close the Lid of Your Notebook Computer
 
• Press the Power Button on Your Desktop or Notebook Computer
 
• Press the Sleep Button on Your Desktop or Notebook Computer

117
 Chapter 7: Reducing Energy Consumption in Windows
Choices for the Power Button options include:
 
✓ Do Nothing: Dangerous if you’re putting your notebook into your back-
pack or messenger bag because it will keep running — and possibly 
burn itself out without proper ventilation.
 
✓ Stand By: A good choice for desktops but not wise for notebooks 
because sometimes Stand By mode allows the computer to wake. See Do 
Nothing, above, for the 411 on why this isn’t a smart choice.
 
✓ Hibernate: Smart for desktops and notebooks alike because it com-
pletely powers off your computer so it isn’t wasting any energy at all. 
Note that this mode does return you to your running programs when 
you turn it back on.
 
✓ Shut Down: Does exactly what it says, and powers off your computer.
Hibernate
Click Enable Hibernation if it appears; if not, your Windows XP does not have 
what it takes — technologically speaking — to use the Hibernation power-
saving mode. Rest assured when you’re ready to upgrade to a new Windows 
computer you can bet it will hibernate if that’s your preference.
UPS
Though you don’t see a tab labeled UPS in Figure 7-9, a UPS (Uninterruptible 
Power Supply) tab will appear on your Power Options Properties panel if 
Windows XP detects your computer is attached to a battery backup power 
supply. Here’s where you can check on the status of your UPS. Click Configure 
to set notifications to alert you when the UPS’s battery is running low, as well 
as instruct your computer to shut down when the UPS is almost out of juice.
Making Additional Windows Vista and 
XP Power Options Adjustments
You can tweak the Windows Vista and XP power options as described in 
the previous section to automatically move a few seats closer to the front of 
the class for minimizing energy consumption when you’re using — and not 
using — your PC. Well done, old chap. But why settle for anything but the best 
energy-saving setup possible? Making a few additional adjustments can move 
you to the head of the computer conservation class, earning you the right to 
stick a green star on your forehead, if that’s your idea of fun. Why not? You cer-
tainly will deserve it after tending to these extra-savings extra credits.

118
Part III: Minimizing Your Computer’s Carbon Footprint 
Take a stroll through the following smorgasbord of power-related settings, 
features, and other options, and follow the appropriate steps or actions to 
turn off or tweak those that can help make your increasingly green PC even 
greener. Unless otherwise noted, these settings and options apply to both 
Windows Vista and Windows XP.
Windows Mobility Center (Vista only)
This handy control panel is an all-in-one dashboard of modules for gauging 
and controlling a number of Windows Vista settings of the energy-saving 
variety. To open it, choose Start➪Control Panel➪Windows Mobility Center. 
Settings you can monitor and change on any Vista notebook include those 
shown in the upper two rows in Figure 7-11:
 
✓ Battery gauge and power plan chooser
 
✓ Display brightness
 
✓ External display
 
✓ Presentation settings
 
✓ Sound volume and mute
 
✓ Sync Center
 
✓ Wireless network
Certain manufacturers may also include additional Windows Mobility Center 
modules, such as the ones included with the Lenovo ThinkPad X200s, shown 
in the bottom two rows of Figure 7-11. 
Throughout this section, I give you details about other ways of adjusting 
these settings to garner energy savings.
Brightness
This setting is easy to understand — and change — for better energy savings. 
Simply put, lowering your display’s brightness uses less energy. Personally, 
I’ve never been able to dim the screen even one notch without feeling as if it’s 
too dim. Other people I know have no problem working on their computers 
with the screen brightness knocked down a few notches.

You can adjust your Windows computer’s display by doing one of the 
following:
 
✓ On notebook computers, press the Brightness Down key until the screen 
is black, and then press Brightness Up one keypress at a time until 
you reach a level that’s easy on the eyes — and, hopefully, on your 
energy use.
 
✓ On Windows Vista computers, choose Start➪Control Panel➪Power 
Options➪Adjust the Display Brightness, and then drag the slider to the 
left to dim the screen or to the right to make it brighter.
 
✓ On stand-alone monitors and LCD displays connected to desktop com-
puters, or all-in-one desktop computers follow the instructions in the 
first bullet if your computer has dedicated brightness keys. If it doesn’t, 
use your Vista computer display’s brightness control to decrease, 
and then increase, the brightness until it’s just right for your eyes, as 
described in the preceding bullet.

Part III: Minimizing Your Computer’s Carbon Footprint 
Screen saver
Yes, screen savers are pretty to look at. And, once upon a time, they were 
darned helpful when it came to preventing permanent damage to your monitor.
But nowadays screen savers are mostly useless because the green choice 
is to blank the screen completely rather than consume power by keeping it 
on to display an animated sequence or other eye-catching, energy-wasting 
delight that’s probably going unnoticed anyway because you are, after all, 
away from the computer in the first place, right? Phew, that was a mouthful!
Okay, I admit I’m a hypocrite in this area because I do run my screen saver — 
but only for a minute, because it’s a learning experience. I have the Word of 
the Day scroll past to broaden my vocabulary!
 
Instead of running a screen saver, set your Windows computer to turn off the 
monitor when you aren’t using it. I describe how to do so earlier in the chap-
ter. See the “Choosing and customizing Windows Vista’s Power Plans” and 
“Choosing and Customizing Windows XP’s Power Schemes” sections.
To turn off the screen saver on your Windows computer:
Windows Vista:
 
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Personalization➪Screen Saver.
 
 The Screen Saver Settings dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-12.
 
Figure 7-12:

 Chapter 7: Reducing Energy Consumption in Windows
 
2. Click the arrow on the drop-down menu and choose (None), and then 
click OK.
Windows XP:
 
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Display, and then click the Screen Saver 
tab.
 
2. Click the drop-down menu and choose (None), and then click OK.
Keyboard brightness
Got a slick new notebook or desktop computer with a backlit keyboard? 
Sweet! The keyboard is definitely eye-opening when playing a game in the 
dark or working in low-light situations, but it’s also a sucker for power when 
you aren’t using it.
You typically dim your Windows desktop or notebook’s keyboard backlight-
ing by pressing the keyboard buttons dedicated to doing just that. Check 
your computer’s or keyboard’s documentation for specific instructions on 
how to adjust or deactivate keyboard backlighting.
Wireless networking
Think about how your computer connects to the Internet. It might be con-
nected with an Ethernet cable running from your cable or DSL modem, or net-
work router, to your computer’s Ethernet port. Or, your computer might be 
connected wirelessly to your Wi-Fi router or the one at the café you’re sitting 
in that lets you connect free — or almost free, when you factor in the cost of 
a cup of joe or tea.
If your computer is plugged in with an Ethernet cable, there’s no reason to 
have your Windows computer’s built-in wireless networking adapter turned 
on. The reason is that it’s wasting energy — and draining your notebook’s 
battery more quickly when you’re away from a wall adapter but not con-
nected to a Wi-Fi network, if yours is a notebook PC.
To turn off your Windows computer’s wireless networking option when you 
aren’t using it:
Windows Vista:
 
1. Click Start➪Control Panel➪Network and Sharing Center, and then 
Disconnect.
 
2. Click the Close button to close the Network and Sharing Center con-
trol panel.

122
Part III: Minimizing Your Computer’s Carbon Footprint 
Windows XP:
 
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Network Connections➪Wireless 
Network Connection, and then click the Disable button.
 
2. Click the Close button.
 
To monitor Wi-Fi status, or to quickly connect and disconnect (as shown in 
Figure 7-13 for Windows XP), click the Network icon on the taskbar. If you 
don’t see the Network icon in your Windows XP or Vista taskbar, here’s how 
you can turn it on:
 
✓ Windows Vista: Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Taskbar and Start Menu, 
and then click the Notification Area tab and check the box next to 
Network under System Icons.
 
✓ Windows XP: Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Network 
Connections➪Wireless Network Connections, and then click the 
Properties button and select the Show Icon in Notification Area When 
Connected check box.
 
Figure 7-13: 
Turning off 
the wireless 
connection.
 
 
Most notebook computers have a function key (Fn) combo to turn Wi-Fi net-
working (and Bluetooth) on or off.
Many notebooks also have dedicated on-off switches or buttons along their 
front or side edges, or above the keyboard, often near the computer’s power 
button.
Bluetooth
Turning on your Windows computer’s built-in Bluetooth feature (if it has it) 
lets you connect to other devices, such as
 
✓ A wireless mouse: For clutter-free mousing around
 
✓ A hands-free headset: For clearer Skype webcam voice and video chats

123
 Chapter 7: Reducing Energy Consumption in Windows
 
✓ Another Mac or Windows PC: To send files back and forth
 
✓ A Palm, BlackBerry, or other brand of smartphone: To keep your 
device and your address book and calendar in sync.
If you have no idea what I’m talking about, you probably aren’t using 
Bluetooth, which means that it’s wasting energy — and draining your note-
book’s battery more quickly when you’re away from a wall adapter.
To turn off your computer’s Bluetooth feature when you’re not using it, 
choose one of these options:
 
✓ Press the Fn key and then, on the upper row of the keyboard, the key 
bearing the Bluetooth symbol.
 
✓ Switch off your notebook’s dedicated Bluetooth power button if it has 
one (usually located on the front or side of the keyboard or above it).
 
Turning off the Bluetooth devices you connect to your computer, such as a 
headset and mouse, helps extend their battery life so that you don’t need to 
recharge them as often.
A wireless mouse may come with its own charging base, which should 
be unplugged from the wall outlet or USB port unless the mouse needs a 
recharge.
Sound
Lowering your computer’s sound volume or turning it off uses less energy 
than when you have it cranked up full blast. Of course, then you can’t hear 
music or the alert sound whenever a new e-mail message lands in your inbox. 
Press the Volume Up, Volume Down, and Mute keys to adjust your comput-
er’s sound level accordingly.
If your keyboard has no sound control keys, don’t worry. Adjusting your com-
puter’s volume or muting it altogether is easy — just turn on the Sound icon 
on the taskbar by following these steps:
 
✓ Windows Vista: Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Taskbar and Start Menu, 
click the Notification Area tab and select the Volume check box under 
System Icons.
 
✓ Windows XP: Click Start➪Control Panel➪Sound and Audio Devices, and 
then click the Place Volume in the Taskbar check box. 

124
Part III: Minimizing Your Computer’s Carbon Footprint 
To adjust the volume, click the Speaker icon on the taskbar and drag the 
slider up or down to adjust the volume. Or, click the Mute button (Vista) or 
check box (XP) to silence your computer.
 
The following list highlights other measures you can take to reduce the 
amount of energy used by your computer’s sound system:
 
✓ Use headphones. Plugging in headphones is another way to save energy 
because they draw less power than speakers — and they’re helpful for 
blocking out the chatterbugs and other distracting sources of noise 
when you’re working on your notebook at a café or another public place.
 
✓ Turn off surround sound subwoofer and speakers. This is the big-
gest sound setting step you can take to reduce your computer’s power 
consumption in a meaningful way — if your sound setup includes a sub-
woofer and three or more surround-sound speakers.
Indexing options (Vista only)
The speedy Windows Vista search option gets its fast-finding action kick by 
frequently performing indexing, which means that it’s regularly scanning 
your computer’s hard disk to keep track of all the files on it — and files no 
longer on it.
If you’re running your Windows Vista notebook on battery power more often 
than not, deactivating Windows Indexing Options can lengthen how long you 
can keep working before having to plug in again to recharge your battery.
To stop Windows Vista from sucking down power by regularly indexing your 
computer’s hard disk, follow these steps:
 
1. Click Start➪Computer.
 
2. Right-click the Hard Disk (C:) icon, then choose Properties.
 
3. Deselect the Index This Drive for Faster Searching option and then 
click OK.
 
4. Click OK to accept the default option, Apply Changes to Drive C:\, 
Subfolders and Files, as shown in Figure 7-14.
 
5. Click Continue if prompted for permission, and then click Continue 
again.
 
6. When you’re finished, click OK to close the Hard Disk Properties 
dialog box.

Deselecting the Vista indexing option as I describe stops any indexing of your 
hard disk — but not the underlying indexing process that Windows constantly 
runs in the background, whether you’re using it or not. To disable the index-
ing service, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Start button and choose Run.
 
2. Type services.msc and press Enter.
 
3. In the right column, scroll down to and double-click Windows Search.
 
4. Click Stop if the button is not grayed, and then choose Disabled from 
the drop-down menu.
 
5. Click OK and then click the Close button.

Chapter 8
Conserving Power with Your 
Mac’s Energy-Saver Settings
In This Chapter
▶ Instantly minimizing your Mac’s energy use
▶ Automatically adjusting your Mac’s Energy-Saver settings
▶ Fine-tuning energy-saving settings on the Mac
I
n this chapter, I tell you how to adjust your Mac’s energy settings to 
save greenbacks while doing a little something for the environment. You 
manage your Mac’s energy usage and settings in three general ways:
 
✓ On-the-fly: By on-the-fly, I mean those options that you can change 
quickly and easily. Examples include moving the mouse pointer to a hot 
corner to instantly shut off the display or closing the lid on your Mac to 
instantly put it in Sleep mode. I cover the gambit of on-the-fly options in 
the chapter’s first section.
 
✓ Automatically: Adjust your Mac’s Energy Saver preferences to specify 
how long to wait before the display or the computer enters Sleep mode. 
Activate the Energy Saver Schedule option to tell your Mac when to turn 
itself on or off or enter Sleep mode, based on day and time choices that 
you set to suit your individual workday, nighttime, and weekend routine.
 
✓ Specialized: Run a power management utility or Dashboard widget that 
you can download for free or for a fee, as I describe in Chapter 6. These 
utilities and widgets generally aim to let you simplify or enhance the 
Mac’s Energy Saver Preferences panel.
Making other adjustments, such as disabling your Mac’s Bluetooth and 
AirPort wireless features if you aren’t using them, also helps reduce your 
Mac’s carbon footprint. Applying these energy-saving adjustments, and 
others, is described in the section “Making Additional Mac Energy-Saving 
Adjustments,” later in this chapter.

128
Part III: Minimizing Your Computer’s Carbon Footprint 
Minimizing Your Mac’s 
Energy Use On-the-Fly
Minimizing your Mac’s energy consumption on-the-fly is a no-brainer: Press 
your Mac’s power button and then click either the Sleep or Shut Down button 
in the dialog that opens (see Figure 8-1). Or, skip the mouse click and press 
the S key to choose sleep, or press Return to tell your Mac to shut down.
 
Figure 8-1: 
Instant 
energy 
savings!
 
Close the lid on your MacBook to instantly put it to sleep. Waking it is just 
as easy: Open the lid, and your Mac snaps instantly awake, ready to serve. 
That’s what I call instant green gratification. Unfortunately, this method of 
closing the lid to induce sleep doesn’t work on desktop Macs, so don’t bother 
tipping your heavy monitor or LCD display face down onto the keyboard or 
desktop. (I speak from experience).
You can also move the mouse to one of the Desktop hot corners to instantly 
put the display in Sleep mode. (A hot corner is a corner on your Mac’s display 
which, when you move your mouse pointer to it, causes your Mac to take one 
of a number of actions you’ve assigned it.) You can also activate other events 
with hot corners — start the screen saver or display your Mac’s Dashboard 
Widgets, for example.
To put your Mac’s display in Sleep mode when you move the pointer to a hot 
corner, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Apple menu and then choose System Preferences.
 
2. Click the Desktop & Screen Saver icon.
 
3. Click the Hot Corners button.
 
4. Click the button corresponding to the corner of your choice, and then 
choose Sleep Display, as shown in Figure 8-2.
 
 If you want, choose Sleep Display for a second or third corner — or even 
all four.
 
5. Click OK and then click the Close button to close System Preferences.

Cutting the power to your desktop Mac’s external monitor (if you’re using 
one) is another easy way to blank the screen and save energy when you leave 
your Mac for more than a few minutes.
Being responsible and remembering to perform the smartest energy-saving 
actions need not rest on your shoulders alone, however. Let your Mac 
remember for you, by setting it up to take care of its energy-saving options 
for itself. All it takes are a few simple adjustments to your Mac’s Energy Saver 
Preferences panel, as described in the following section.
Adjusting Your Mac’s Automatic 
Energy-Saver Settings
To change your Mac’s energy-saving options — such as whether it powers off 
the hard disk when possible, or how long it waits before turning off the dis-
play, or entering Sleep mode — you use the Energy Saver Preferences panel.
  

130
Part III: Minimizing Your Computer’s Carbon Footprint 
To open the Energy Saver Preferences panel, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences.
 
2. Click the Energy Saver icon.
If you use a MacBook, you see two clickable tabs, Battery and Power Adapter, 
at the top of the Energy Saver preferences panel (see Figure 8-3). Desktop 
Mac users see two options: Sleep and Options.
 
Figure 8-3:

If you can’t move the sliders or select and deselect the check boxes, the likely 
reason is that the settings are locked. To unlock the settings so that you can 
change them, do what it says alongside the tiny lock icon in the lower-left 
corner: Click the lock to make changes.
Starting from the top, here’s a description of the Energy Saver options:
 
✓ Computer Sleep: Moving this slider to the left is the greener way to go. 
Moving to the right is less efficient because it allows a smart device to 
do nothing other than burn energy for no good reason.
 
✓ Display Sleep: Maybe you take a break and then return to your com-
puter at regular intervals and you don’t want to wake your Mac from 
lots of catnaps several times a day. Fair enough. Set the Computer Sleep 
slider (see the preceding bullet) a little farther to the right and then drag 
the Display Sleep slider to the left to snap your Mac to attention in a 
flash, with only the slightest pause before the screen comes back to life.

131
 Chapter 8: Conserving Power with Your Mac’s Energy-Saver Settings
 
✓ Put the Hard Disks(s) to Sleep When Possible: Select this option to 
“snooze” the hard disk whenever it determines that the programs you’re 
running don’t need to keep the drive (or drives) spinning. If you regu-
larly perform hard disk intensive tasks, such as edit videos or play 3D 
games, deselect this option.
 
✓ Wake for Ethernet Network Administration Access: If you don’t know 
what this option means, deselect it. If you’re told not to, you probably 
work in a company or an organization that reserves the right to oversee, 
maintain, start up, shut down, manage, or regulate computer usage in 
ways beyond your control. In that case, it’s beyond my control to advise 
you do anything other than leave this option selected. If you routinely 
access your Mac remotely when you’re away from it, however, leave this 
option selected to keep the connection alive.
 
✓ Automatically Reduce the Brightness of the Display Before Display 
Sleep: When you select this option, the brightness level on the display 
drops a few notches before blanking out the screen after the length of 
time you select in the Display Sleep setting (see preceding bullet).
 
✓ Restart Automatically After a Power Failure: Whether it’s brownouts, 
blackouts, or black cats knocking out power cords, power failures 
happen. Use this option to specify how your Mac should react when the 
lights come on again after a power failure. Select the check box if you 
want your Mac to restart, and deselect it if you prefer to turn it back on 
yourself after the power is running again.
 
 
For a greener choice, deselect this option unless your Mac is pull-
ing duty as a server or performing some other service that absolutely 
requires it to be on 24/7 — no ifs, ands, or buts.
 
✓ Show Battery Status in the Menu Bar: Selecting this option on your 
MacBook lets you keep visual tabs on how much battery juice remains 
when your machine is unplugged from the wall outlet — and how long 
you need to wait until its battery is fully charged after you plug into 
a power outlet. To change the information you see, click the Battery 
Status icon and then Show, and then choose Icon Only, Time, or 
Percentage to see your battery’s status the way you like it.
 
✓ Schedule: Click the Schedule button to open these scheduling options:
 
• Start Up or Wake: Choose when you want your Mac to greet you on 
weekdays or weekends, every day, or one day in particular. (The 
scheduler has no option for folks whose “Friday night” begins on 
a weekday.) Click the up and down arrows to adjust the time, as 
shown in Figure 8-4 — or just click the time slots and enter your

Taking advantage of your Mac’s Energy Settings undoubtedly helps mini-
mize its carbon footprint, but wait — there’s more! You have more ways to 
minimize your Mac’s power usage by switching off certain features or other 
devices. You have more ways to save running downloadable miniprograms or 
widgets that simplify the process of making the smartest energy-saving set-
tings possible.
Making Additional Mac Energy-Saving 
Adjustments
Tweaking your Mac’s Energy Saver options as described earlier in this chap-
ter automatically moves you a few seats closer to front of the class for mini-
mizing energy consumption when you’re using — and not using — your Mac.
Well done, ’ol chap. But why settle for anything other than the best energy-
saving setup possible? Making a few additional adjustments can earn you the 
right to stick a green star on your forehead, if that’s your idea of fun. Why 
not? You’ll certainly have deserved it after tending to these extra-savings 
extra credits.
Have a stroll through a smorgasbord of power-related settings, features, 
and other options by following the appropriate steps or actions to turn off 
or tweak those that can help make your increasingly ecofriendly Mac even 
friendlier.

 Chapter 8: Conserving Power with Your Mac’s Energy-Saver Settings
Brightness
The brightness level is easy to understand — and change, for better energy 
savings. Simply put, lowering your display’s brightness level uses less energy. 
I’ve never been able to dim the screen even one notch without feeling like it’s 
too dim. Other people I know have no problem working on their Macs with 
the brightness level knocked down a few notches.
Adjust your Mac’s display brightness by using one of these methods:
 
✓ The Brightness Down key: Press this key until the screen is black, and 
then press Brightness Up one keystroke at a time until you reach a level 
that’s easy on the eye — and, hopefully, on the energy use.
 
 Note: Older Mac models may not have Brightness keys on their 
keyboards.
 
✓ The Displays Preference Panel: Click the Apple menu, choose System 
Preferences, and then click the Displays icon. Slide it to the left to dim 
the display, and slide it to the right to brighten the scene.
 
 You can set a newer MacBook to automatically adjust the brightness, 
depending on how light or dark it is where you’re working, if you select 
the Automatically Adjust Brightness As Ambient Light Changes check 
box, shown in Figure 8-5.
 
 On stand-alone monitors and LCD displays, follow the guidelines in the 
preceding list, using your display’s brightness control to decrease, and 
then increase, the brightness level until it’s just right for your eyes.

If your Mac’s Brightness Up and Brightness Down keys aren’t responding, hold 
down the Fn key and press the Brightness keys again. To change your Mac’s 
keyboard so that the Brightness key and others work without holding down 
Fn, click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences, then click the 
Keyboard & Mouse icon➪Keyboard, and then deselect the Use All F1, F2, Etc. 
Keys As Standard Function Keys check box.
Screen saver
Yes, screen savers are pretty to look at. And once upon a time they were 
helpful for preventing permanent damage to your monitor. But nowadays 
screen savers are mostly useless because the green choice is to blank the 
screen rather than consume power by keeping it on to display an animated 
sequence or other eye-catching, energy-wasting delight that’s probably going 
unnoticed anyway because you are, after all, away from the computer in the 
first place, right? Phew!
I admit that I’m a hypocrite on this topic because I run my screen saver — 
but only for a few minutes because it’s a learning experience, as I explain in 
the nearby sidebar, “Word of the day: Deadhead.”
To shut off your Mac’s screen saver and make it fade to black, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences.
 
2. Click the Desktop & Screen Saver icon, then click the Screen 
Saver tab.
 
3. Drag the Start Screen Saver slider to Never.
Word of the Day: Deadhead
Repeat after me: “I shall not let my Mac’s 
screen saver run for more than a few minutes 
(the minimum amount of time allowed) before 
blanking the screen.” I set mine to three minutes 
because that’s all the idle time my MacBook 
needs in order to pop up my screen saver 
of choice: Word of the Day. It appears after I 
haven’t touched my MacBook after three min-
utes, a length of time that easily passes while I’m 
fixing a sandwich or setting up another round of 
tea in the autodrip. Because my workspace 
is stationed next to my kitchen (in a one-
room house, which room isn’t next to it?), my 
MacBook’s switch to Screen Saver mode 
always catches my eye, and rarely do I fail 
to move closer to learn a new word I didn’t 
know — or relearn the meaning of one I thought 
I knew so well. Today’s word that appeared as 
I was waiting for the Word of the Day Screen 
Saver to kick in? Deadhead. My favorite Grateful 
Dead song of late? “Touch of Gray.” Learning 
new words every day? Priceless.

4. Click the Show All button at the top of the System Preferences window.
 
5. Click the Energy Saver Preference icon.
 
6. Drag the Display Sleep slider to choose the number of minutes (3 or 5, 
for example) that you want the display to wait before turning off when 
your Mac is idle.
 
7. Click the Close button to close System Preferences.
Keyboard brightness
Dimming, turning off, or automatically adjusting the keyboard backlighting on 
a newer MacBook can help save energy — and extend battery life when your 
machine isn’t plugged into a wall outlet.
To adjust your MacBook’s keyboard backlighting, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Apple menu, choose System Preferences➪Keyboard & 
Mouse, and click the Keyboard tab, if it isn’t selected.
 
2. Select or deselect the Illuminate Keyboard in Low Light Conditions 
check box.
 
3. If you choose to select the option, click and drag the Turn Off When 
Computer is Not Used For slider to adjust how long your Mac should 
wait before it does just that.
 
 This step specifies how long your MacBook waits before turning off key-
board backlighting when you aren’t using it.
Require password to wake computer from sleep
Read this handy tip if you work in an office or 
another environment where you don’t want 
someone snooping on your computer when 
you’re away from your desk. (If it’s only you 
and your dog, cat, or goldfish in the house, this 
feature can be annoying, especially if your Mac 
goes to sleep after only a few minutes.)
To make your Mac ask for your password when-
ever it awakens from Sleep mode or when it’s 
running the screen saver:
 1. Click the Apple menu and then choose 
System Preferences.
 2. Click the Security icon.
 3. Select the Require Password to Wake 
This Computer from Sleep or Screensaver 
check box.
 4. Click the Close button to close System 
Preferences.
If you can’t deselect the check box in Step 3, 
it’s because the settings are locked. To unlock 
them so that you can change them, click the 
little lock icon in the lower-left corner, and then 
enter your password and press Return.

Part III: Minimizing Your Computer’s Carbon Footprint 
AirPort
Your machine might be plugged in to the Internet by way of an Ethernet cable 
running from your cable or DSL modem or your network router and into your 
Mac or MacBook’s Ethernet port. Or, it might be connected wirelessly to a 
WiFi router either at home or, if you’re out with your MacBook, at the local 
café that lets you connect for free.
If your machine is plugged in using an Ethernet cable, you have no reason 
to leave your Mac’s built-in AirPort wireless networking feature turned on, 
because it’s wasting energy.
To turn off your Mac’s AirPort wireless networking feature when you aren’t 
using it, click the AirPort icon on the menu bar, as shown in Figure 8-6, and 
then choose Turn AirPort Off.
 
Figure 8-6: 
Turn off 
AirPort 
when you

If you don’t see the Airport Icon in the menu bar, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences.
 
2. Click the Network icon to open the Network Preference panel.
 
3. Select the Show AirPort Status in Menu Bar check box and then click 
the Close button to close the Preference panel.
Bluetooth
Turning on your Mac or MacBook’s built-in Bluetooth feature lets you con-
nect other devices, such as the ones in this list:
 
✓ Wireless mouse: For clutter-free mousing around
 
✓ Hands-free headset: For clearer iChat Webcam video chats

137
 Chapter 8: Conserving Power with Your Mac’s Energy-Saver Settings
 
✓ Another Mac or Windows PC: To send files back and forth
 
✓ A Palm, BlackBerry, or other brand of smartphone: To keep the phone 
and your address book and iCal calendar in sync.
If you have no idea what I’m talking about, you probably aren’t using 
Bluetooth, which means that your Mac is wasting energy — and if you’re 
using a MacBook, draining its battery more quickly when you’re away from a 
wall adapter.
To turn off your Mac’s Bluetooth feature when you aren’t using it, simply 
click the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar and choose Turn Bluetooth Off, as 
shown in Figure 8-7.
 
Figure 8-7: 
Turn off 
Bluetooth

If you don’t see the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Apple menu and choose System Preferences.
 
2. Click the Bluetooth icon to open the Bluetooth Preferences panel.
 
3. Select the Show Bluetooth Status in the Menu Bar check box and then 
click the Close button to close the Preference panel.
 
Turning off the Bluetooth devices that you connect to your Mac, such as a 
headset and mouse, helps extend their battery life so that you don’t need to 
recharge them so often.
A wireless mouse may come with its own charging base, which should 
be unplugged from the wall outlet or USB port unless the mouse needs a 
recharge.

138
Part III: Minimizing Your Computer’s Carbon Footprint 
Sound
Turning your Mac’s sound output down or off uses a little less energy than 
turning it up full blast. Of course, you can’t hear music or the alert sound 
whenever a new e-mail message lands in your inbox. Press the Volume Up, 
Volume Down, and Mute keys to adjust your Mac’s sound level accordingly.
 
The following list highlights other measures you can take to reduce the 
amount of energy used by your Mac’s sound output:
 
✓ Plug in headphones: They draw less power than speakers do — and 
they’re helpful for blocking out the chatterbugs and other distracting 
noisemakers when you’re working on your MacBook at a café or another 
public place.
 
✓ Turn off surround sound subwoofer and speakers: This method can 
reduce your Mac’s overall power consumption in a meaningful way — if 
your sound setup includes a subwoofer and three or more surround-
sound speakers.
Spotlight
Pressing Ô+spacebar opens the most helpful time-saving feature: Spotlight 
search. Type the first letters of a name or word and Spotlight instantly turns 
up such potential matches as Address Book contact cards, e-mail messages, 
music tracks, and documents.
But pulling off the fast-acting finding magic comes at a price if you’re running 
your MacBook on battery juice. To find things darn fast, Spotlight performs 
indexing, which means that it regularly scans the hard disk to keep track of 
all the information on it — and no longer on it.
The “powerful” tale of one tailless mouse
My favorite Mac mouse is the Microsoft 
Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000, which runs on 
two AAA batteries (I use rechargeable ones, of 
course) and automatically enters Sleep mode 
after a few minutes of inactivity.
Reawakening the mouse can take a few sec-
onds after moving it. You gain smarter energy 
savings when you flip over the little creature 
and turn off the tiny power switch to cut the 
juice.
Thanks to the shareware program SteerMouse 
(plentycom.jp/en/steermouse), the 
mouse’s programmable buttons work fine with 
my Mac — but not with my Windows notebooks 
because Microsoft never created a driver spe-
cifically for this particular mouse model.

139
 Chapter 8: Conserving Power with Your Mac’s Energy-Saver Settings
If you run your MacBook on battery power more often than not, deactivating 
Spotlight can lengthen the time between recharges.
To prevent Spotlight from indexing your Mac’s hard disk, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Apple menu and then choose System Preferences➪Spotlight.
 
2. On the Privacy tab, shown in Figure 8-8, click the plus (+) button near 
the lower-left corner.
 
3. Click Macintosh HD (or whatever you renamed your hard disk) and 
click Choose.

t’s time for a virtual shopping trip to Planet Green Mall. 
The ecofriendliest energy-efficiency technologies now 
available are found in the latest greener gadgets. So, when 
you choose the most ecofriendly gadgets that money can 
buy, your rewards double: You have a greater sense of 
having made the smartest choice for the planet, and you 
have a greater sense of having made the smartest choice 
for your wallet. 
I help you figure out whether a company’s supposed 
green products are truly ecofriendly or just greenwash. I 
also show you what makes the tiniest wind-up flashlight 
or the largest energy-efficient high-definition TV green.

Chapter 9
Knowing the Difference Between 
Truly Green and Greenwash Hype
In This Chapter
▶ The “It” thing of our time: Paying to be (seen as) green
▶ The Greenpeace Guide to Greener Electronics
▶ The Greenpeace Electronics Survey
▶ Another take on green gadgets, from the Consumer Electronics Association
▶ Company information straight from the source
You can’t turn on the TV, open a magazine, or listen to the radio without 
hearing about this product’s green benefits or that company’s efforts 
in improving the planet by being green. That’s because every company 
under the sun wants to be seen as green. It’s the “It” thing of our era. Sorting 
through what’s real and what’s hype isn’t so glamorous and can be dizzying.
In this chapter, I explain the difference between being truly green and just 
greenwashing, or making misleading or false claims about a company’s eco-
friendly practices and the products it produces. Understanding this differ-
ence can help you make the greenest choices possible before buying new 
gadgets and other consumer electronic goods.
I also point you to regularly updated resources for staying on top of how 
high-tech manufacturers rank on the list of the greenest (and not so green) 
giants in the industry.
Paying to Be (Seen As) 
Green Is Big Business
It pays to be green, and most major corporations are spending lots of green 
in ad dollars to ensure that you know how hard they’re working on their 

144
Part IV: Acquiring Green Gadgets and Gear 
ecofriendly marketing. So figuring out on your own which claims companies 
make are true, false, or somewhere in the middle can be next to impossible. 
Fortunately, many companies are pulling back the veil and making public 
their environmental impact on many or all levels, including internal practices 
and policies for reducing consumption. In addition, many companies are 
detailing the resources and processes involved in producing, packaging, and 
distributing the digital stuff they sell.
As you navigate companies’ ecoclaims, check out a study by TerraChoice 
(http://terrachoice.com), an agency that offers its environmental 
marketing services to companies. It made news in 2007 for its “Six Sins of 
Greenwashing” study. In it, TerraChoice reported that of the slightly more 
than 1,000 consumer products making environmental claims the company 
surveyed, all but one product committed at least one of the six sins. As the 
chart shown in Figure 9-1 points out, the Sin of Hidden Trade-Offs takes the 
cake — er, pie — as the most commonly committed greenwashing “sin.”

Here’s a rundown of the six greenwashing sins — they’re also listed on a 
TerraChoice downloadable wallet card for easy reference when making 
purchases:
 
✓ Sin of the Hidden Trade-Off: The product focuses only on one or two 
environmental issues while ignoring others of equal importance.
 
✓ Sin of No Proof: Neither the company nor the product can give evidence 
of its claim.
 
✓ Sin of Vagueness: The manufacturer provides little detail, if any, for 
issues such as amount of packaging, manufacturing process, and prod-
uct disposal.

145
 Chapter 9: Knowing the Difference Between Truly Green and Greenwash Hype
 
✓ Sin of Irrelevance: The company makes claims that are true of all prod-
ucts in a particular category.
 
✓ Sin of Fibbing: The manufacturer cannot back up certified claims or 
prove certification.
 
✓ Sin of the Lesser of Two Evils: The claim tries to make you feel “green” 
about a product category that’s basically “ungreen.” Is organic tobacco, 
for example, truly a green product?
Many, if not most, companies are making changes and improving their pro-
duction, packaging, distribution, and recycling policies and practices to truly 
become green and produce greener products and services. As far as wanting 
you to take a company at its every ecofriendly word, the makers of comput-
ers, mobile phones, video game consoles, digital cameras, GPS locators, and 
other high-tech, chip-based products are no different from companies that 
produce paper towels or potato chips. They all want to be seen as green.
Reviewing the Greenpeace Guide 
to Greener Electronics
Taking companies’ green claims to task are organizations such as 
Greenpeace, which analyzes and publicly details which (and where) com-
panies meet, exceed, and fall short of promises — and how they stack up 
against their competitors.
Every quarter, Greenpeace releases its Guide to Greener Electronics (www.
greenpeace.org/electronics). It focuses on overall corporate policies 
and practices for the 18 high-tech companies it reviews and features on its 
easy-to-read summary widget, shown in Figure 9-2.

Tapping In to the Greenpeace 
Electronics Survey
The second annual Green Electronics Survey evaluated in 2008 a total of 50 
products manufactured and submitted by 15 companies. The survey evalu-
ated such factors as whether products contain hazardous chemicals, level 
of energy efficiency, lifecycle based on ability to recycle and upgrade, design 
innovation, and the promotion of environmental friendliness.
The types of products submitted for the survey included
 
✓ Desktop and notebook computers
 
✓ Mobile phones, smartphones, and personal digital assistants (PDAs)
 
✓ LCD and plasma TVs and LCD monitors
And, here’s a list of participating companies:
 
✓ Acer
 
✓ Dell
 
✓ Fujitsu Siemens
 
✓ Hewlett Packard
 
✓ Lenovo
 
✓ LG Electronics

Companies that were invited by Greenpeace to submit products but opted 
out of the survey include Apple, Asus, Microsoft, Nintendo, Palm, and Philips.
Although Sony submitted its PlayStation 3 for review, the report couldn’t 
include a category for video game consoles because of the absence of 
Microsoft and Nintendo. In a Chapter 5 sidebar, I describe a study in which 
video game machines were found to gobble an estimated 16 billion kilowatt 
hours per year, or the approximate amount used annually, as the report 
states, by the city of San Diego. The PlayStation 3, shown in Figure 9-3, draws 
more power than the second-place Microsoft Xbox 360, and the Nintendo Wii, 
which requires the least amount of power to keep you in the game.

Greenpeace found that although none of the products included in the survey 
could claim the title of Truly Green, many companies scored higher and more 
competitively than they did in the previous year.
The good news is that fewer products now contain PVC plastic or hazardous 
chemicals. Greenpeace also found that most companies adhere to the latest 
Energy Star requirements while also rolling out better voluntary take-back 
and recycling programs.
The highest-scoring products in each category on a scale from 1 to 10 — such 
as the Lenovo L2440x, shown in Figure 9-4 — are listed in Table 9-2.

The not-so-good news, as Greenpeace points out in its survey, is that the 
greenest new gadgets and other electronic devices are generally green in one 
or more areas but not in others.
Although the gadget-and-electronics industry is moving in the right direction 
from the Greenpeace perspective, the organization believes that companies 
need to “up the ante” by applying the innovations of their most ecofriendly 
products across all product lines.
Considering Another Take on Green 
Gadgets: The Consumer Electronics 
Association
The Consumer Electronics Association is a trade association that promotes 
growth in the $171 billion U.S. consumer technology industry (2009 forecast) 
through events like the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES), research, 

150
Part IV: Acquiring Green Gadgets and Gear 
promotion, policy, and the fostering of business and strategic relationships. 
A study by the CEA found that nearly 90 percent of consumers consider 
energy efficiency to be an important factor in picking out a television to buy. 
The name of the study is “Environmental Sustainability and Innovation in the 
Consumer Electronics Industry” and you can find it here: 
www.ce.org/GovernmentAffairs/2267.asp
A few choice nuggets from the study are in the nearby sidebar, “I want my 
greener MTV!”
At the same time, less than half of the nearly 1,000 study participants felt 
comfortable with understanding the ins and outs of green gadgets and elec-
tronics and the companies that manufacture them. To put it bluntly, many 
people aren’t sure what being green means when they choose gadgets and 
other high-tech devices to buy. Here’s a case in point: Although nearly 
three-quarters of people surveyed said that they expect companies to do 
everything in their power to protect the planet, fewer than 20 percent were 
confident about the practices, policies, procedures, and promises of the com-
panies building the items they buy — or intend to buy.
I want my greener MTV!
Here are some highlights from the Consumer 
Electronics Association (CEA) report “Environ-
mental Sustainability and Innovation in the 
Consumer Electronics Industry:”
 ✓ The top 20 companies included in the study 
build roughly half of the consumer electron-
ics units in the world.
 ✓ In 2007, Best Buy sold seven million prod-
ucts with the Energy Star label on them. 
According to Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) accounting, these pur-
chases saved those people $100 million in 
utility bills while preventing an estimated 
1.4 billion pounds of carbon emissions from 
flaking out into the atmosphere. That’s simi-
lar to plucking nearly 130,000 cars off the 
street.
These companies stood out in the recycling 
category:
 ✓ Crutchfield: The gadget and electronics 
retailer and e-tailer replaced polystyrene 
peanuts with biodegradable starch pellets 
in nearly 1 million outbound shipments — 
an estimated 600,000 pounds of waste that 
might have otherwise wound up in local 
landfills.
 ✓ Hewlett-Packard: HP recycled more than 
400 million pounds of computer hardware 
since it began its recycling program in 1987.
 ✓ Kodak: The company collected 120 million 
single-use cameras of all manufacturer 
types for recycling in 2007. Single-use 
cameras might seem at first to be a drag 
on the planet, but the CEA survey cites that 
Kodak has recaptured an estimated 1.2 bil-
lion cameras since the company began the 
program in 1990. Why all the fuss? Nearly 
all Kodak single-use cameras now in pro-
duction use recycled parts.

151
 Chapter 9: Knowing the Difference Between Truly Green and Greenwash Hype
Fifty percent of people interviewed felt that companies will do whatever 
it takes to sell their products — even if it means exaggerating ecofriendly 
corporate policies and product features. And, slightly more than half of the 
study participants questioned the validity of the information they read about 
green gadgets and gear.
 
The CEA Web site for finding out about green gadgets, computers, and other 
consumer electronics is www.myGreenElectronics.org. The Web site also 
offers an energy calculator to figure out how much your electronics are cost-
ing you to use them, and a recycling location finder.
Taking Companies at Their 
Own Green Word, Sort Of
When you visit the Web sites of companies that build the products you’re 
thinking about purchasing, or that you already own, you can find out about 
their environmentally friendlier products, initiatives, attitudes, actions, reac-
tions, and satisfaction-guaranteed promises. You might also discover that 
the maker of that to-die-for gadget you’re itching to purchase has a take-back 
recycling option to relieve you of the gadget several years down the road.
Browsing gadget-makers’ 
ecocentric Web sites
Visiting the Web site of a company that builds gadgets, computers, and other 
high-tech gear that you’re interested in buying can help you gauge how seri-
ous it is about creating ecofriendly products.
This list presents a sampling of eye-catching company Web pages that aim to 
educate you about their green leanings:
 
✓ Apple: The new Apple notebook model is pitched as “the greenest

I
n this chapter, I show you the ins and outs of buying computers the green 
way before you even enter the store.
Before you whip out your credit card, I tell you about upgrades that can make 
your computer feel like new again — or nearly new — and save you from 
having to buy a whole new computer. Upgrading the PC you already own also 
helps save the environment because it reduces your consumption — and the 
use of resources necessary to build and ship a new computer.
If you can’t upgrade, I help you get a handle on the latest computer energy 
standards and ratings, such as Energy Star and EPEAT (Electronic Product 
Environmental Assessment Tool), and point out ways to evaluate how com-
puter manufacturers stack up against one another when it comes to being 
green.
With a number of new desktop and notebook choices to illustrate green com-
puting trends, I take you on a tour of standout Windows and Mac models.

Part IV: Acquiring Green Gadgets and Gear 
Considering Upgrades to Make Your 
Computer Feel New Again
 
When you upgrade your existing desktop or notebook computer rather than 
buy a new one, you honor the three Rs — reduce, reuse, recycle — all at once by
 
✓ Reducing the need to use raw elements and resources to build, ship, 
and power a new computer.
 
✓ Reusing a computer you already own by making it more useful with hard-
ware upgrades to increase performance, or upgrading the operating system 
(OS) to give you new features and functions absent from the old OS
 
✓ Recycling the computer’s power to serve you better by adding upgrades 
while compelling you to properly recycle parts you swap out but can’t use
Upgrading hardware
You can make your computer feel new again by upgrading its internal hard-
ware parts and components, or adding new ones. To enhance your existing 
computer’s hardware, you generally
 
✓ Exchange or add more random access memory (RAM) so that you can 
run more applications at one time and more quickly.
 
✓ Replace the internal hard drive with a faster, larger capacity, more 
energy-efficient model (or add an external model) so that you can store 
and access more programs and files more quickly — while using less 
power
 
✓ Add an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse to your notebook com-
puter, as shown in Figure 10-1, so that you can work more comfortably 
with it without having to buy a new desktop to achieve the same result
 
✓ Add a network router that lets you print to a connected printer or share 
files on a connected hard drive rather than having separate printers and 
external hard drives all around the house

Part IV: Acquiring Green Gadgets and Gear 
Upgrading operating systems 
and applications
You can also make your computer feel new again by upgrading your comput-
er’s operating system (OS) and applications, or adding new ones. To enhance 
your existing computer software, you generally
 
✓ Upgrade or replace your computer’s Mac or Windows OS with a newer 
version so that you can benefit from the performance and productivity 
enhancements found in the latest versions.
 
✓ Give your Mac or Windows PC a totally new look and feel by replacing 
(or adding and dual-booting) its OS with a free Linux OS distribution, 
such as Ubuntu (www.ubuntu.com).
 
✓ Run Windows on your Mac in a separate partition with Apple’s Boot 
Camp (or a with virtualization program, such as Parallels or Fusion) so 
that you can run Windows applications without having to buy a second 
Windows computer.
 
✓ Add new applications or upgrade ones you already have to the latest 
version so that you can benefit from more features and functions.
Choosing and installing upgrades
Figuring out what you want to upgrade — and whether you can install it your-
self — depends on which options from the previous two sections can make 
your old computer feel new again. Consider these tips when upgrading your 
computer:
 
✓ Install more memory in your desktop or notebook computer, which is 
typically easy, whereas replacing or adding a new internal hard drive is 
generally not so simple.
 
✓ Check your computer’s manual or visit the support section of your 
computer manufacturer’s Web site to find out what upgrade options are 
available for your particular model.
 
✓ Buy from online discount computer and gadget retailers rather than 
directly from the computer manufacturer, which can save you money. 
The following three, which I use, offer savings:
 
• Amazon.com: Memory upgrades, peripherals, and software
 
• Crucial: Memory upgrades at http://crucial.com
 
• TigerDirect.com: Memory upgrades, peripherals, and software

159
 Chapter 10: Choosing Green Mac and Windows Computers
 
✓ Check prices before buying by searching the product price comparison 
sites, such as MySimon.com or Froogle.com, which can turn up even 
larger savings. Pay attention to Star ratings and user comments, which 
can often spell the difference between spending a few bucks more and 
getting what you want on time versus paying the absolute lowest price 
and then winding up waiting a week for your goods to show up.
 
✓ Reuse or repurpose components or programs you’ve upgraded or 
replaced by selling, giving away, or recycling them.
Getting Up-to-Speed on Computer 
Energy Standards and Ratings
In Chapter 1, I talk about the basic charters of the two key players in the 
electronics energy efficiency standards game — Energy Star and EPEAT. 
Becoming acquainted with them can help you choose the greenest gadgets, 
computers, and other electronics.
 
I recap briefly here as each pertains to buying a new computer:
 
✓ Energy Star: Launched in 1992 by the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA), this program is designed to help consumers identify 
energy-efficient products. Initially, computers and monitors were the 
first products to wear the Energy Star logo, and since partnering with 
the Department of Energy in 1996 for additional product categories, the 
label can now be found on everything from major appliances and office 
equipment to DVD players and set-top cable TV boxes. (Not to mention 
notebook and desktop PCs, printers, and other computer-related prod-
ucts.) Check out www.energystar.gov.
 
✓ Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool, or EPEAT: This 
procurement system helps buyers consider, compare, and choose com-
puter products based on environmental attributes. Earning one of the 
three EPEAT ratings is sort of like winning an Olympic medal — which is 
exactly how the three levels of accomplishment are named:
 
• Bronze: Products meet all required criteria
 
• Silver: Products meet all required criteria plus 50 percent of 
optional criteria
 
• Gold: Products meet all required criteria plus 75 percent of 
optional criteria

160
Part IV: Acquiring Green Gadgets and Gear 
All EPEAT-registered products are automatically Energy Star qualified. The 
EPEAT and Energy Star Web sites have information about whether a specific 
computer, printer, or other peripheral makes the Energy Star (www.energy
star.gov) or EPEAT (www.epeat.net) grade — and if so, at which level. 
Evaluating Computer Manufacturers’ 
Levels of Greenness
In Chapter 9, I discuss how you can make your way through the muck of 
greenwash hype to find out what products are truly green and who’s making 
those products. Computer companies, such as Apple, Dell, HP, Lenovo, 
Toshiba, and others, have all spoken publicly about their own green efforts, 
and they all have sections on their Web sites to back up their claims.
The Greenpeace Guide to Greener Electronics, which I discuss at length in 
Chapter 9, helpfully ranks the top 18 consumer electronics manufacturers of 
TVs, computers, video game consoles, and cellphones based on their policies 
on toxic chemicals, recycling, and climate change.
The Electronics section of Consumer Reports Greener Choices Web site 
(www.greenerchoices.org; look under the Products and Green Ratings 
heading) also can help you narrow down potential computer picks organized 
by three categories:
 
✓ Budget: Suffices for basic tasks; has a DVD burner and two-piece speakers.
 
✓ Workhorse: Faster and more powerful for multimedia needs; has a DVD 
burner and three-piece speakers.
 
✓ High end: Optimal for graphic design and gaming; has a Blu-ray drive, 
TV tuner, and three-piece speakers.
At the time of this writing, Lenovo, Gateway, and HP, respectively, took top 
honors in those three categories.
 
Consider whether a computer company offers a program to take back, repur-
pose, or properly recycle your old computer to help you choose which com-
pany gets the green from your wallet. Visit their Web site and navigate to the 
green or environment section to find out.
Some companies take back only their own products, whereas others, such 
as Dell, will come to your doorstep to pick up old computers and peripherals 
made by other manufacturers.

161
 Chapter 10: Choosing Green Mac and Windows Computers
Getting a Handle on Green Computers
Windows or Mac? That is the question. And it’s typically the first decision 
you make when choosing a new desktop or notebook computer. Of course, 
you might also consider a Linux-based computer, especially if you’re thinking 
about buying a new and inexpensive, ultralightweight netbook, such as the 
ASUS Eee PC model (see Figure 10-2), which is useful for light duty tasks such 
as e-mail and browsing the Web.
 
Figure 10-2: 
Netbook: 
No energy-
saving 
lightweight.
 
Although I don’t dedicate a whole section to Linux-based computers, I do 
give a nod to the ability to run Linux on some of the choices described later, 
in the section “Looking at Green Windows Computers.”
The next question you’ll want to ask is “Desktop or notebook?”
 
Whatever way you go — Mac or Windows, desktop or notebook (or netbook) — 
keep the following general computer energy usage points in mind to help you 
make the greenest choice possible:
 
✓ Notebooks use less power than desktops. Except for honker-sized ultra-
whiz-bang (and heavy) notebooks such as the ones Alienware builds for 
playing high-end games with the panache of a full-blown desktop PC, 
notebooks use less power than desktops.
 
✓ LCD displays are more efficient than monitors. I can’t remember the 
last time I’ve seen an old-fashioned cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor, 
and maybe you can’t remember either. If someone tries to sell you one, 
say no thanks and go with an LCD screen. The newer LED type offers the 
best energy savings — and instantly powers on to full brightness rather 
taking a while to warm up to full brightness, the way non-LED type dis-
plays do.
 
✓ Faster processors use more power. Buying the fastest PC available 
rewards you with speedier performance, but not without paying a price 
in consuming more power and increasing your electric bill to boot.

162
Part IV: Acquiring Green Gadgets and Gear 
 
✓ Adjust energy saving settings to save more power. Tweak your new 
computer’s energy settings, which can cut its energy usage by half. I talk 
briefly about making adjustments a little later in this chapter, and for 
more on the subject, check out Part III.
 
✓ Make a future-proofed purchase. The ability to upgrade a computer 
means that you can keep using it longer than one that’s not as adaptable 
to changing with the times. The Apple MacBook Air, for instance, excites 
techno-lust for its sleekness, but garners groans for its sealed case 
design, which makes it impossible to replace the rechargeable battery 
yourself if the battery stops holding a charge. For that, you have to send 
it to Apple or another company that specializes in opening and upgrad-
ing sealed products such as the MacBook Air.
 
✓ Lots of connections are a good thing. Paying a little more for features, 
such as built-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi wireless networking, can ensure 
your new computer can connect to your other gadgets — such as digital 
cameras, headsets, wireless routers, keyboards, and mice — well into 
the future before some new standard comes along and renders those 
means obsolete.
 
 Other features to look for include
 
• The most current operating system (OS) so that you don’t have to 
spend more money just to catch up with the OS Jones’s, so to speak.
 
• Lots of Universal Serial Bus (USB) ports and, ideally, at least one 
FireWire port, for connecting other devices, such as cellphones, 
PDAs, printers, digital cameras, externals hard drives, and memory 
keychains.
 
✓ Smart power strips save even more power. Plugging any type of 
computer or peripheral into a smart power strip such as the Belkin 
Conserve, as shown in Figure 10-3, can take a bite out of energy vam-
pires by reducing or completely cutting power consumption and costs. 
Check out Chapter 1 to read how to stop sneaky energy vampires all 
around the house.

 Chapter 10: Choosing Green Mac and Windows Computers
Picking Green Macs
Apple launched its new MacBook last year, which says a lot about where the 
company and its products are today when it comes to getting green. In his 
2008 Environmental Update, Apple CEO Steve Jobs wrote, “We are constantly 
working to reduce the emissions associated with Apple’s products. This 
means making them more efficient in size and energy consumption.” A few 
months later Apple described its newly designed 13-inch MacBook as “the 
greenest MacBook ever.”
Although green-gadget watchers gave the 13-inch MacBook mostly good 
reviews, Greenpeace noted that “not all toxic pieces have been eliminated yet.” 
Those not-so-nice pieces are generally made of polyvinyl chlorides (PVCs) or 
brominated flame retardants (BFRs), which are poisonous when burned — 
which is par for the course in the polluted overseas recycling markets where 
much of Western e-waste winds up. In the MacBook’s case, Greenpeace is refer-
ring not to the notebook unit itself, but rather to the PVCs contained in the 
external power adapter and cord included with the MacBook.
According to EcoGeek.org editor Hank Green, “the one revolutionary aspect 
of the MacBook — its solid aluminum brick construction — is not green at 
all.” Apple’s claim that “a single piece of solid, recyclable aluminum that 
replaces dozens of extraneous pieces once destined for landfill,” may be 
accurate, but EcoGeek’s Green wrote on his Web site that the design creates 
unnecessary energy expenditures, which he deems “a step backward.”
What about the rest of the MacBook’s green qualifications? With both Energy 
Star 4.0 compliance and EPEAT Gold status, the MacBook earns its place with 
more than 100 other notebooks green enough to wear the gold star, so to speak.
 
If you want to know more about your computer’s general power issues and 
energy-saving options, I cover that in greater detail in Chapter 6 (along with 
information on how to run easy- to- use energy-saving utilities). Chapter 8 
covers how to adjust your Mac’s specific Power Saver preferences.
Positively green printers
All the major printer manufacturers — I’m talking 
about Canon, Epson, HP, Kodak, and the rest of 
the majors — are hip to building green printers. 
They’re also working harder to make it as easy as 
possible to recycle used toner and ink cartridges. 
Visit the companies’ same-name-dot-com Web 
sites to catch up on the latest green printing prod-
ucts and policies that can help you hang onto a 
little extra printed green of your own. In Chapter 
17, I discuss a green printer from Canon and an 
ecofriendly ink system that’s good for your wallet, 
too.

164
Part IV: Acquiring Green Gadgets and Gear 
Breaking down the MacBook, 
piece by piece
The MacBook has both green and not-so-green parts, some of which come 
out as recyclables, including:
 
✓ Aluminum all-around: The single slab of recyclable aluminum, or 
the unibody enclosure, along with an aluminum lid and base equal 
three easily separable pieces of metal when the MacBook reaches the 
hopelessly useless stage at the end of its life. Still, reviewers such as 
EcoGeek’s Hank Green believe creating the unibody enclosure uses more 
energy than it’s worth.
 
✓ Mercury- and arsenic-free glass screen: All LCD screens are glass; how-
ever, most get covered with plastic shields. No shield gets in the way of 
the MacBook’s LED backlit LCD recyclable glass display, which is free of 
the mercury or arsenic found in older displays. The display consumes 
30 percent less power than conventional LCD displays, and as I mention 
earlier, it lights to full brightness when powered on, without needing 
time to warm up, like non-LED–type LCD displays.
 
✓ BFR- and PVC-free (almost): Although Apple eliminated brominated 
flame retardants — or BFRs — from the circuit boards and polyvinyl 
chlorides (PVCs) from the internal cables and connectors, at the time 
of this writing, Apple has yet to eliminate PVCs from the external power 
adapter and cord. Apple says it’s working to achieve PVC-free status for 
its external parts — and it may get there by the time you read this.
 
✓ Less packaging: Made from a minimum of 25 percent post-recyclable 
material, the MacBook’s completely recyclable packaging, as shown in 
Figure 10-4, is 41 percent smaller than the preceding model’s packaging. 
This reduction is not only appreciable to the buyer but also to the envi-
ronment because Apple says it can fit 25 percent more units into ship-
ping containers, thereby reducing greenhouse gases by way of reduced 
shipping sizes and materials.
 
Figure 10-4: 
Minimizing 
packaging.
 

165
 Chapter 10: Choosing Green Mac and Windows Computers
 
✓ Sensors and energy savings: A built-in light sensor gauges the room 
you’re in and automatically dims or brightens the screen and keyboard, 
as shown in Figure 10-5. When powered on and sitting idle (but not 
entering Sleep mode, per se), the MacBook uses about as much power 
as a 15-watt light bulb.

Considering other Macs and products
Many of Apple’s green choices, which I describe in the preceding section, 
carry over to all its products as the company works to achieve greater green 
status. The Apple Mac mini desktop, as shown in Figure 10-6, is tiny, quiet, 
and uses very little energy — that’s because many of its internal parts are 
based on notebook computer components, which means they sip less power 
to do their thing.
 
Figure 10-6: 
Apple Mac 
mini — 
quiet as a

166
Part IV: Acquiring Green Gadgets and Gear 
Other Apple choices are the high-powered, high-performance Mac Pro tower 
desktop and the all-in-one iMac desktop. Unlike the Mac Pro, which requires 
the additional purchase of a display, the iMac binds the computer and the 
display into a single, thin ecofriendly package that has you doing a double-
take because it looks like a monitor, minus the computer. For that reason, it’s 
the greener choice of the two desktops.
 
If you’re thinking about buying an Apple desktop, notebook, or peripheral, 
such as the LED Cinema Display, go to Apple’s Web site at www.apple.com. 
There you can find the most up-to-date information about what green features 
the LED Cinema Display may have, as shown in Figure 10-7.

pany’s green section of its Web site at www.apple.com/environment.
Looking at Green Windows Computers
Although Apple’s high-stylin’ products consistently make the company some-
thing of a media darling, lots of companies manufacturing computers that 
run Windows are just as ambitious when it comes to enacting — and being 
seen as a leader of — green policies, production processes, and recycling 
programs.
 
Go to the Energy Star (www.energystar.gov) and EPEAT (www.epeat.
net) Web sites to find out whether a specific computer, printer, or peripheral 
is up to specifications when it comes to energy efficiency.

167
 Chapter 10: Choosing Green Mac and Windows Computers
Note: At the time of this writing, the computers described in the following 
sections were not yet commercially available with Windows 7. Chances are 
good that updated models of these computers and a whole lot of others will 
ship with Windows 7.
 
To get the most thorough understanding of all things energy saving — espe-
cially with the PC you already own — check out Chapters 6 and 7. In those 
chapters, I tell you how to
 
✓ Maximize your computer’s energy-saving options: Chapter 6 has the 
details.
 
✓ Adjust specific Windows power options and tweak other settings for 
green personal computing: I fully explain these options in Chapter 7.
 
✓ Download and run easy-to-use energy-saving gadgets or applications: 
One such gadget is Edison (it’s free!), and I discuss it in Chapter 6.
Two green Windows desktops
The Dell Studio Hybrid PC isn’t much bigger than a hardback book and can 
change its casing skins faster than a chameleon — and a bamboo one at 
that — while the HP TouchSmart IQ800t allows you to skip the keyboard and 
reach out and touch its screen to surf the Web. (In the nearby sidebar, “A 
teeny PC with its head in the clouds,” I describe a third ecofriendly PC that 
deserves kudos even though it doesn’t run Windows.)
Dell Studio Hybrid PC
The Dell Studio Hybrid PC earned EPEAT Gold status, which means it’s 
among the greenest PCs you can buy. In my book, it also deserves the Best 
Dressed award as well, thanks to slip-on sleeves to change the computer’s 
look and feel. Touchy-feely sleeve choices include a rainbow of colors, 
leather, and my favorite, bamboo.
Note: You need to add a keyboard, a mouse, and a monitor in order to inter-
act with the Studio Hybrid. The following less superficial features make the 
Studio Hybrid an interesting green PC choice:
 
✓ Smaller size: Eighty percent smaller than standard desktops, which 
makes it easy to move from room to room.
 
✓ Wireless options: Wireless mouse and keyboard options follow along 
without tripping you up with cords; Wi-Fi networking keeps you tapped 
into the Internet no matter which room you wind up in.
 
✓ Energy efficient processors: Energy efficient Intel Core 2 Duo Mobile 
Processors sip as much — make that, as little — energy as a notebook 
rather than a hulking desktop PC.

168
Part IV: Acquiring Green Gadgets and Gear 
 
✓ TV tuners and Blu-ray: An optional digital/analog TV tuner enables you 
to watch, pause, and record live TV — and reduce your carbon foot-
print by eliminating the need for a separate TV. An optional Blu-ray disc 
player turns it into a high-def movie theater in a box.
 
✓ Efficient standards: Uses about 70 percent less power than a typical 
desktop and meets Energy Star 4.0 standards with an 87 percent efficient 
power supply.
 
✓ Recyclable packaging: Packaging is made from 95 percent recyclable 
materials. In addition, the Hybrid comes with about 75 percent less 
printed documentation then typical tower desktops, so fewer materials 
are used in this regard, too.
 
✓ System recycling kit: Comes with a system recycling kit so that you can 
help preserve and protect the environment.
HP TouchSmart IQ800t series
Sandwiching the display screen and computer together makes the HP 
TouchSmart IQ800t, as shown in Figure 10-8, easy to move from room to 
room — or to the kitchen counter.
 
Figure 10-8:

Simply touch the screen to flip through recipes on the Web or change chan-
nels on the built-in TV. Earning EPEAT Silver status, the TouchSmart IQ800t 
balances energy efficiency with beefed up performance for playing high-end 
games or editing pictures with Photoshop.

169
 Chapter 10: Choosing Green Mac and Windows Computers
Other features that make the HP TouchSmart IQ800t an interesting green PC 
choice include the ability to
 
✓ Hold video chats with the built-in Webcam and microphone
 
✓ Watch, pause, rewind, and record live high-def TV on the built-in wide-
screen — which saves you (and the planet) from buying a new or second 
HDTV
 
✓ Expand as needed via the built-in pocket media drive bay and optional 
drive
 
✓ Reduce your PC energy use up to 45 percent
 
✓ Use 55 percent less metal and 35 percent less plastic than standard PCs 
and monitors
 
✓ Is packaged in a reduced amount of plastic foam cushioning
A pair of green Windows notebooks
Choosing one of these notebooks can be as easy as deciding which style suits 
you best: Are you a button-down business-type, or someone who likes to 
wear his oh-so-greenness on his sleeve where no one can miss it?
A teeny PC with its head in the clouds
By eliminating a built-in hard drive and skipping 
a cooling fan, the EPEAT Gold and Energy Star 
4.0 rated Zonbu PC (www.zonbu.com), shown 
here, is a super energy-saving choice for light-
weight duties, such as browsing the Web. The 
Zonbu PC is referred to as a cloud computer, 
which means you pay a monthly subscription to 
store your files on an Internet-based file service 
rather than on the computer itself. The Zonbu 
PC is less vulnerable to sneaky spyware or virus 
attacks because it runs on Linux rather than 
Windows, and, of course, you can’t do anything 
with Zonbu PC until you plug in a monitor, a key-
board, and a mouse, sold separately. Whether 
standalone, cloud-based, microsize PCs such 
as the Zonbu PC catch on (remember 3Com’s 
Audrey or MSN TV — oh-oh, I think I’m dating 
myself), one thing seems certain: More and 
more smartphones and computers are tapping 
into cloud-based services, such as MobileMe, 
SugarSync, and others. Who says you can’t be 
in two places at once?

In Chapter 1, I describe the Toshiba Portégé R600 which, at the time I was writ-
ing this book, had earned the title of “greenest notebook.”
Lenovo ThinkPad X200s
Encased in protective Magnesium-alloy and armed with built-in airbag-like 
hard drive protection in case you drop it, the Lenovo ThinkPad X200s means 
serious business — and EPEAT Gold status means it’s just as serious about 
saving energy as well.
You can carry around the 2.5 pound notebook without stressing your shoul-
der. You can also snap the notebook into an optional dock when you’re home 
to ease eyestrain by turning it into a desktop with a keyboard, a mouse, and a 
monitor.
Standout aspects that make the ThinkPad X200s particularly ecofriendly 
include
 
✓ Custom power management features, low-voltage processors, a less 
power hungry display, and the latest battery technology to help you eek 
out up to 12 hours of all-day computing before it’s time to plug in for a 
recharge.
 
✓ The solid-state drive option means no moving parts, faster performance, 
and less power consumption than a traditional hard drive.
 
✓ A spill-resistant keyboard, sealed and contained within a tray with spe-
cial drain holes to channel spills to the bottom of the system to lessen 
opportunity for damage, means knocking your coffee on this notebook 
won’t spell death.
 
✓ A fingerprint scanner embedded in the wrist rest ensures only your fin-
gerprint can unlock the X200s and not a thief’s.
 
✓ A built-in nightlight illuminates the keyboard in dark settings — drawing 
less energy than turning on a desk lamp or other room light.
ASUS U6V-V1-Bamboo Laptop
Enshrouded quite literally with nature, the ASUS U6V-V1 Bamboo notebook 
is, at its core, as ecofriendly on the inside as the outside.
Standout features that make this notebook the most eye-catching computer 
you’ve ever laid eyes on include
 
✓ EPEAT Gold status
 
✓ LED backlit LCD display that instantly turns on to full brightness and 
consumes less power than non-LED LCD displays

 Chapter 10: Choosing Green Mac and Windows Computers
 
✓ Super Hybrid Engine extends battery life between 35–53 percent when 
compared to other notebooks
 
✓ A security fingerprint scanner to protect your identity and personal files 
in the event of loss or theft
 
✓ A built-in Webcam with face-scanning capabilities for even greater per-
sonal identity protection and security
 
✓ Instant movie-watching in ten seconds to save power without requiring 
the computer to fully boot up to Windows
Enjoying the beauty and bamboo touch isn’t limited only to the ASUS notebook 
or the Dell Studio Hybrid PC, which I describe earlier in the “Two ecofriendly 
Windows desktops” section. Bamboo-accented peripherals and computer-
related add-ons are just some of the choices I show you in Chapter 17.

Buying Green Mobile Phones and 
Handheld Gadgets
In This Chapter
▶ Dipping into the ins and outs of handheld gadgets
▶ Calling up the greenest mobile phones
▶ Considering audio and video players that go easy on the environment
▶ Reading e-books to save a tree or two
▶ Discovering the breezy greenness of windup gadgets
Y
ou’ve come to the right place if you’re looking for the latest multiple-
personality gadgets — including MP3 and video players, handheld video 
games, e-book readers, and supersmart phones that pull quadruple duty on 
all those products — because they are those products yet also happen to 
work as phones.
Other handheld or multifaceted green gadgets covered in this chapter 
include windup radios with built-in flashlights that convert your elbow grease 
into raw power and a solar-powered Bluetooth headset that gets its charge 
from daylight.
Getting Up to Speed on 
Green Gadget Matters
Choosing green mobile phones and other multiple-personality gadgets such 
as iPods or windup radios (see the Freeplay Companion in Figure 11-1) means 
keeping in mind a number of ecofriendly factors. A few examples of green 
gadget personality traits include gadgets which:

174
Part IV: Acquiring Green Gadgets and Gear 
 
✓ Are manufactured, distributed, and eventually taken back and recy-
cled by companies that use fewer — or zero — toxins: These compa-
nies also practice the highest level of ecofriendly compliance possible, 
as judged by organizations such as Greenpeace, the EPA’s Energy Star 
program, and the Consumer Electronics Association.
 
✓ Are highly energy-efficient: A gadget uses the least amount of energy 
while offering the longest battery life possible, thereby decreasing how 
frequently you plug it in to the recharger.
 
✓ Can be charged using energy sources other than a wall outlet: Some 
examples include built-in cranks to recharge gadgets by winding the 
crank, or a built-in solar panel that can convert sunlight to energy — 
two features you’ll find on the combination radio/flash light shown in 
Figure 11-1.

Before forking over your hard-earned greenbacks for a new green gadget, 
check manufacturer Web sites, green-gadget blogs, and product-review Web 
sites to find the latest green gadget information. In Chapter 9, I explain how 
you can find out how companies and the products they build rate among each 
other in ecofriendliness. A good starting point is the Greenpeace Guide to 
Greener Electronics, which I discuss further in that chapter.
Taking my own advice (which I give in Chapter 9), I selected the assortment 
of green gadgets populating the following pages to illustrate ecofriendlier 
factors, features, and follow-through at the end of the products’ lifecycles. 
Of course, keep in mind that this overview is subject to change. New gadgets 
are introduced every day; new models and updated versions are par for the 
course.
 
After buying your new phone, check out Chapter 4 to find the most energy-effi-
cient ways to use your green gadgets.

Dialing in to Green Mobile Phones
Choosing the greenest mobile phone — or carrier, as described in the 
nearby sidebar, “CREDO’s green mobile phone mission” — can be helped 
by researching the latest models on the Web. Opening your Web browser 
and searching for greenest cellphone or greenest mobile phone turns up a 
number of results that point to stories or product pages for mobile phones 
claiming the title.
Knowing whether the claims are still current (or, for that matter, accurate) 
can be tricky. Was the claim staked last week — or last year? Using the 
Google Advanced Search option can help you winnow your results to show 
recent ones rather than older ones that have become outdated.
 
To use the Google Advanced Search option to search for new or recent green 
mobile phones:
 
1. Type google.com/advanced_search in your Web browser’s address 
field and press Return or Enter.
 
2. In the Find Web Pages That Have All These Words field, type greenest 
mobile phone.
 
3. Scroll down to the middle of the page and click Date, Usage Rights, 
Numeric Range, and More, as shown in Figure 11-2.
 
4. Click the Date pop-up button and select Past Week or Past Month 
(refer to Figure 11-2), and then click Advanced Search in the lower-
right corner.

Part IV: Acquiring Green Gadgets and Gear 
Using this search method, as well as contacting company sources and using 
the resources I talk about in Chapter 9, all helped me choose the following 
handful of mobile phones that epitomize the greenest gadgets money can buy.
You might notice that one visible product — the Apple iPhone — is absent 
from the roster of green mobile phones. At the time this book was writ-
ten, the iPhone 3G still contained not-so-nice-for-the-environment toxins, 
as detailed by Greenpeace in the report Missed call: the iPhone’s hazardous 
chemicals (www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/iphone-s-hazardous-
chemicals). Apple got it right for the iPod nano, however, which I detail 
later in this chapter.
CREDO’s green mobile phone mission
“It was the greed-is-good 1980s. Gordon Gekko, 
and all that,” says CREDO Mobile CEO Laura 
Scher. “A lot of my friends got out of college 
and headed straight to Wall Street. But I wanted 
something different — or rather, I wanted to 
make a difference.” And so began the story 
of CREDO (www.credomobile.com), a 
mobile-phone provider that is on a mission to 
be the greenest carrier in the world.
Originally founded as Working Assets in 1985, 
the company was formed by a small group 
of idealists aiming to further causes such as 
human rights, women’s rights, peace, and 
environmentalism. The vision was simple: to 
turn everyday purchases into automatic acts of 
generosity. The group developed an innovative 
long-distance service that functioned as both a 
phone company and a progressive lobby, donat-
ing 1 percent of monthly phone-bill payments to 
progressive nonprofit organizations chosen by 
customers.
The Working Assets movement grew steadily 
over the next 23 years, providing steadily growing 
support for a wide range of progressive nonprofits, 
before making the leap to mobile phones, which 
prompted a new name to better reflect its charter: 
CREDO Mobile.
At the time this book was written, CREDO says 
that it and its members have donated more than 
$60 million to the groups that members them-
selves help select, including Doctors Without 
Borders, the American Civil Liberties Union, 
the Global Fund for Women, Greenpeace, and 
Planned Parenthood. Along the way, CREDO 
has generated 5,652,914 letters, 15,785,829 
e-mails, and 932,992 calls to political and cor-
porate decision-makers.
Besides offering mobile phones and service 
plans, CREDO Mobile also sells ecofriendly 
accessories such as the Iqua solar Bluetooth 
headset, and cool cellphone cases made from 
recycled tires salvaged from Colombian cargo 
trucks.
“Hello, Mother Nature? Can you hear me now? 
Good!”

 Chapter 11: Buying Green Mobile Phones and Handheld Gadgets
Motorola MOTO W233 Renew
www.motorola.com
Motorola states that the MOTO W233 Renew, shown in Figure 11-3, is the 
world’s first carbon-neutral cellphone, thanks in part to a plastic housing 
made entirely from recycled water bottles. The phone ships in a smaller 
package, and it and all the printed materials inside it are made from 100 per-
cent post-consumer recycled paper.
As the first mobile phone to earn carbonfree certification, Motorola’s alliance 
with Carbondfund.org means that the company offsets the amount of carbon 
dioxide it uses to manufacture, distribute, and use the phone.
Other green perks are described in this list:
 
✓ Longer-lasting charge. Motorola estimates that you can expect up to 
nine hours of talk time with the Renew — which means less tapping in to 
the recharger and more energy savings for you.
 
✓ Trees are planted. Furthering the phone’s ecofriendly theme, mobile 
carrier T-Mobile will plant a tree in your name if you sign up for the 
company’s paperless billing option. Partnering with the Arbor Day 
Foundation, T-Mobile reportedly planted more than a half-million trees 
in 2008.
 
✓ Recycling is made easy. To recycle the phone at the end of its life, you can 
just drop it off at the nearest T-Mobile phone store, or mail it in, using a pre-
printed mailing label you create on the T-Mobile or Motorola Web sites.
Ranking the greenest mobile phones
At the time this book was written, the 
latest Greenpeace Guide to Greener Elec-
tronics report (www.greenpeace.org/
electronics) gave top honors to Nokia 
6210 Navigator smartphone, followed by the 
Sony Ericsson G900. Both devices are PVC-
free, but the Nokia gadget earned extra credits 
for its better energy efficiency and lifecycle.
Judging cellphones, the Samsung SGH-F268 
came in first, followed by the Motorola V9, the 
Nokia 3110 Evolve, the Sony Ericsson C905, and 
the LG Electronics KT520, taking fifth place. In 
the report, Greenpeace stated that the phone 
makers have taken major steps in reducing 
toxic chemicals, and “all but the LG phone 
claimed to be PVC-free, and Samsung’s phone 
being free of BFRs, well below the commonly 
used so-called ‘halogen-free’ industry limit of 
900ppm bromine.”

178
Part IV: Acquiring Green Gadgets and Gear 
 
✓ Sustainability is ongoing. Proceeds gained from T-Mobile’s handset-
recycling efforts contribute to the company’s social investments, and 
to schools participating in Race to Recycle, which is part of T-Mobile’s 
sustainability practice.
 
Although the MOTO W233 Renew was offered exclusively to T-Mobile custom-
ers for six months after it launched in early 2009, your carrier may be offering 
the green mobile phone by the time you read this. To find out, visit your carri-
er’s Web site and browse the selection of mobile phones its supports and sells.

Samsung SGH-W510, SGH-F268, 
and E200 Eco
www.samsung.com
Even though you couldn’t buy either product at the time I wrote this chapter, 
the Samsung SGH-F268 earned top honors in the 2008 Greenpeace Guide to 
Greener Electronics, and the SGH-W510 made news as the first mobile phone 

179
 Chapter 11: Buying Green Mobile Phones and Handheld Gadgets
to use parts made from bioplastics, which are extracted from natural material 
such as corn. Both phones highlight developments worth keeping in mind 
when considering other mobile phones and their makers.
Samsung says it uses no dangerous metals (lead, mercury, or cadmium) 
when producing SGH-W510, and that the SGH-F268 and all its accessories con-
tain no BFRs (brominated flame retardants) or PVCs.
An alarm feature alerts you when the SGH-F268 is fully charged, to encourage 
you to unplug the charger.
Combining the best of both mobile phones is the Samsung E200 Eco, shown 
in Figure 11-4, which is encased entirely in corn-based bioplastics. It features 
a built-in alarm that reminds you to unplug the charger when the battery is 
fully charged.

Nokia 3110 Evolve and N79 eco
www.nokia.com
Featuring biocovers made from more than 50 percent renewable materials 
and a charger that draws 94 percent less power than Energy Star requires, 
the Nokia 3110 Evolve is a good example of a green mobile phone.
Going one step beyond the Samsung SGH-F268 alarm that reminds you to 
unplug the charger at full charge, the 3110 Evolve charger notches down 
power consumption to next-to-nil after the phone is all charged up.

Part IV: Acquiring Green Gadgets and Gear 
Charging the Nokia N79 when you take it out of its minimal, ecofriendly box 
isn’t an option — unless you plug in a charger you already own. Nokia, figur-
ing that it’s greener to reuse an existing charger, doesn’t include one with the 
N79 eco, pictured in Figure 11-5.
Neither phone was available in the U.S. at the time this book was written, but 
buyers in the United Kingdom can feel good knowing that Nokia donates 4 
pounds sterling to the World Wildlife Fund for each N79 eco it sells.

Phoning the future: Nokia Eco Sensor Concept
At the time this book was written, Nokia held 
the top spot on the Greenpeace Guide to 
Greener Electronics (www.greenpeace.
org/electronics). Inventing a mobile 
phone that taps into wearable sensors that 
analyze your body’s vital signs and your imme-
diate environmental surroundings is what Nokia 
envisions with its Eco Sensor Concept (www.
nokia.com/A4707477).

 Chapter 11: Buying Green Mobile Phones and Handheld Gadgets
Looking at Green MP3 and Video Players, 
and Other Entertaining Gadgets
Greenpeace lavished praise on Apple for eliminating PVCs and BFRs from its 
newest iPods — which is why I’m citing the world’s most popular music and 
video player to kick off this section. The other three music and video players 
I describe here are also greener choices — two of them get their juice fix from 
the sun, and the other powers up from good old-fashioned elbow grease.
iPod nano
www.apple.com
Specifically, the latest Apple iPod nano is greener than its predecessors 
because it
 
✓ Has an arsenic-free glass display
 
✓ Contains no brominated flame retardants (BFRs)
 
✓ Contains no mercury
 
✓ Contains no PVCs
 
✓ Is housed in a highly recyclable metal casing
Add to that list the fact that the iPod nano ships in a minimum-size, recy-
clable package, and the sum of those parts equals a fine example of a green 
music and video player choice if you’re in the market to buy one. The nano is 
also a great entertainer for playing games, with downloadable titles such as 
Tetris, Pac-Man, and Uno.
 
Downloading movies and music from the Apple iTunes music store (or ripping 
CDs you already own) and playing them on the iPod nano, shown in Figure 
11-6, uses less energy than spinning the disc equivalents in a CD or DVD 
player.

Shiro SQ-S solar-powered media player
www.shirocorp.com
Although it isn’t readily available in the United States, the Shiro SQ-S solar-
powered media player, shown in Figure 11-7, deserves a nod because it’s such 
a bright idea. The gadget gets its charge from a USB cable plugged into your 
computer, as well as sunlight beaming on its backside when you’re out and 
about. Perhaps other music and video player makers will follow the clever lead 
of Shiro and start slapping solar panels to the backs of their products.

Baylis Eco Media Player
www.ecomediaplayer.com
Winding the Eco Media Player for one minute can provide you with up to 
45 minutes of play time to listen to music or FM radio, watch video, or flip 
through digital photos. The windup gizmo, shown in Figure 11-8, is also a 
flashlight, recorder, backup device, and emergency mobile phone charger. 
(Now, that’s what I call a multiple-personality product!)
Incidentally, the Eco Media Player is brought to you by the inventor of the 
world’s first windup radio, Trevor Baylis, whose other human-powered gad-
gets are described in this chapter’s final section, “Getting Wound Up Over 
Green Windup Gadgets.”

Like the Baylis Eco Media Player, the eMotion Solar Portable, from Media 
Street (see Figure 11-9), can also charge your cellphone or another USB-
capable gadget you plug into it. You can play games on the eMotion portable 
(which you can’t do on the Baylis), read e-books on it, or have it read them 
aloud to you, even while you’re listening to soothing music!

Saving Trees by Reading E-Books
Reading e-books on your cellphone, PDA, notebook computer, or dedicated 
e-book reader — instead of accumulating printed books — helps save trees. It 
also reduces the other drains on the planet’s resources associated with print-
ing and distributing books.
I list in this section mobile and computer e-book (and magazine) reader pro-
grams, dedicated e-book reading devices, and the electronic bookstores you 
can go to browse and download e-books for free or for a price.

The universal e-reading platform Feedbooks is compatible with a wide range 
of mobile devices, including the dedicated readers listed in the next section 
and numerous mobile phones and PDAs. Download titles directly to your 
mobile phone or PDA by opening http://feedbooks.mobi with your gad-
get’s Web browser.
Feedbooks also offers a library where you can download thousands of free 
e-books, publish and share your own content, and create customized news-
papers from Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds and widgets.
Mobipocket Reader
http://mobipocket.com
Mobipocket Reader runs on Windows computers and on mobile phones and 
PDAs that run on the Windows Mobile, Palm OS, Symbian, and Blackberry 
operating systems. The program is free, but the more than 65,000 titles avail-
able on the Web site are not.
Downloading titles to your computer then installing them to read on your 
mobile device is required for all but the Blackberry version of the program. 
Downloading books “over the air,” directly to your Blackberry, means you 
can skip the computer “middleman” step.
The Mobipocket Reader Web site also offers news and other RSS feeds. 
Tapping into them to create your own, custom newspaper can keep you up-
to-date on news and other topics when you’re on the go.
The Web site also offers dictionaries, medical texts, self-help books, and 
language-learning titles.

The eReader e-book reader program runs on Windows and Mac desktops 
and notebooks, as well as on many mobile devices running Windows Mobile, 
Pocket PC, Palm OS, or Symbian operating systems.
The iPhone and iPod touch edition of eReader, shown in Figure 11-10, can 
download titles directly from your online bookshelf account that you regis-
tered with either eReader.com or Fictionwise.com or both.

eReader on the iPhone is my favorite way to read e-books. The text is beauti-
fully crisp, and the display is large and easy enough on my eyes that I prefer 
reading on the iPhone to reading on a larger, dedicated reader such as the 
Kindle 2.
Another reason for this preference is the backlit iPhone display, which is 
pleasant to read in bed with the lights turned off. Like real books, the Kindle 
2 and most other dedicated e-book readers are readable only when the lights 
are turned on, or in daylight.

e-book readers have pros and cons, just like any other product. A few things 
to keep in mind when considering dedicated e-book readers is that they
 
✓ Are generally not backlit, which means you read them in daylight or with 
the lights turned on
 
✓ Can last weeks on a single charge
 
✓ Let you zoom text up or down to suit your type-size taste
 
✓ Typically let you read other content, such as newspapers, Web-based 
RSS feeds, blogs, and more
 
✓ Can connect to your computer, wirelessly “over the air,” or both, to 
download e-books and other reading materials
 
✓ May “blink” when you turn the virtual page, which I find distracting. The 
original Kindle, the Kindle 2, and original Sony Reader are all blinkers, 
but the latest Sony Reader (selling now) is not a blinker.
Amazon Kindle 2
amazon.com/kindle
As thin as a magazine, lighter than most paperbacks, and capable of browsing 
and downloading books and other content over the air from Amazon’s library 
of more than 230,000 books, the Kindle 2, pictured in Figure 11-11, is a dream-
come-true gadget for serious book lovers.

 Chapter 11: Buying Green Mobile Phones and Handheld Gadgets
Although Amazon’s first Kindle was something of a clunker, the new Kindle 
2 is a joy to behold — and listen to, thanks to a text-to-speech feature that 
turns any book into an audio book. The 6-inch black-and-white screen is so 
sharp that you’ll think you’re looking at ink on paper — no wonder they call 
it E-Ink!
Books, newspapers, and blogs are downloaded in fewer than 60 seconds, 
and the Kindle 2 rechargeable battery lasts up to four days with the wireless 
feature turned on. Turn it off, and you can keep turning the Kindle 2 virtual 
pages for up to two weeks.
What’s more, Amazon’s free Kindle application for the iPhone allows you to 
continue reading on your smartphone where you left off, in case you forgot to 
pack your Kindle 2 or decided to leave it behind.
Sony PRS-700BC Reader Digital Book

notes — or use the included stylus to highlight text on the display.
Iliad Reader

Like the dedicated e-book readers described earlier, the Iliad (shown in 
Figure 11-13), presents text in a lifelike way — as though you’re truly look-
ing at ink on paper — and the 10.2-inch display makes it the largest reader 
money can buy. The Iliad also does something the other two cannot: It lets 
you write on the display to make notes, underline text, add comments to 
documents, or entertain yourself with crossword and Sudoku puzzles.
 
Figure 11-13: 
Reading and 
writing are

Besides sketching on the screen, you can also use the stylus to navigate 
menus and pages, and like the other dedicated readers, the Iliad earns ecof-

Electronic bookstores
Here is a brief list of electronic libraries where you can go to browse and 
download books, magazines, and other content:
 
✓ Manybooks.net: Downloading all the e-books you want from the

Getting Wound Up Over 
Green Windup Gadgets
 
Earlier in this chapter, I described the Baylis Eco Media Player, which you can 
charge by winding its built-in crank. Sold by and named after the man who 
invented the windup radio, Trevor Baylis, his company also sells a slew of 
other human-powered gadgets and gizmos:
www.tclproducts.co.uk/baylisnextgeneration.html
Listed in this section is a smattering of crank-to-charge products made by 
Baylis and other human-powered gadget makers:
 
✓ Baylis LED Eco Safety Station: Having a flashlight on hand in case 
the lights go out is always wise — especially when your elbow grease 
charges the battery inside. The station comes with a trio of Eco Mini Pro 
Torch flashlights which, when cranked for a minute, provide 25 minutes 
of light. Keep winding and you can attain a total charge of up to five 
hours.
 
✓ Baylis Mini Eco Radio (see Figure 11-14): The windup radio has come a 
long way since Trevor’s original invention — as epitomized by this prod-
uct. Wind the crank to charge the combination AM/FM radio, flashlight, 
and emergency cellphone charger, or let the built-in solar panel soak up 
some rays to help keep the gizmo charged.

Figure 11-14: 
It’s a flash-
light and 
radio, all in 
one.
 
 
✓ Slik-Stik walking stick: Invented by Baylis protégé Denise Anstey, a dis-
abled woman who was dissatisfied with poorly designed walking sticks, 
the Slik-Stik has a built-in crank to charge superbright LED lights that 
shine a forward beam and a footfall flashlight for safe footing in the dark. 
Other James Bond-like features include a panic button that sounds an 
alarm if you need assistance, and another press can activate the Slik-
Stik’s high-intensity red strobe lights, when you’re trekking near high-
traffic roads and crosswalks.
 
✓ Freeplay Jonta: Advertised as the last flashlight you’ll need to buy, this 
heavy-duty windup torch has superbright LED lights, and a rugged case 
to take hard knocks.
 
✓ Katio Voyager KA500 (see Figure 11-15): Designed to serve during 
emergencies and disasters, a built-in USB jack lets you plug in and 
charge your iPod, cellphone, digital camera, or another gadget — after, 
of course, you charge up the Voyager by cranking the handle or letting 
the sunlight shine down on its built-in solar panel. An efficient LED lamp 
can be used for low-lighting situations such as reading, or amped up for 
fuller flashlight functioning.

Getting Green Gadgets for 
on the Go
In This Chapter
▶ Learning the art of hypermiling
▶ Using efficiency gizmos in your car
▶ Getting around more efficiently with GPS and mobile-phone apps
▶ Working out with green fitness gadgets
▶ Charging up with portable power chargers and extenders
▶ Going places with green garments, bags, and cases
T
he choices and options I focus on in this chapter are all about gadgets 
for on the go. Whether it’s GPS-savvy gizmos to help you plot the most 
direct route between points A and B (saving on gas along the way), or har-
nessing the recharging power of the wind or sun by wearing gadgets on your 
body that do just that, getting out of the house with greener gadgets is what’s 
in store here.
Lastly, I take you on a tour of some superstylin’, ecofriendly, gadgetcentric 
garments, gizmo cases, and notebook bags — items that help you keep all 
those other gadgets safe and dry.
Driving Your Car More Efficiently
Want to save gas, money, and time? You can — by employing efficient driv-
ing habits and smartly plotting your course. The term hypermiling refers to 
the practice of driving more efficiently and safely by anticipating traffic and 

196
Part IV: Acquiring Green Gadgets and Gear 
road conditions and adjusting speed accordingly. That means braking less by 
allowing more space when slowing to a stop and then slowly increasing speed 
when you start moving again.
As the Hypermiling.com Web site puts it, hypermiling can reward you with 
fuel-efficiency savings that lower not only your car’s carbon footprint but 
also how much you spend at the pump. The term hypermiling was coined 
by Wayne Gerdes, whom hypermilers consider the father of the, ah, move-
ment (no pun intended!). Gerdes is known to get an average of 50 miles out of 
every gallon of gasoline he pumps into his Honda Accord, thanks to hypermil-
ing techniques.
Making modifications to their cars and installing gadgets to track their vehi-
cle’s fuel efficiency vitals and other factors is another thing hypermilers do to 
achieve greater savings. I discuss those types of gadgets in the later section 
“Tricking Out Your Car with Efficiency Gizmos.” 
 
Visit these Web sites to find out more about driving more efficiently, reducing 
how much you spend at the pump, and, subsequently, lowering your car’s 
carbon footprint:
 
✓ www.fueleconomy.gov: Operated by the United States Department 
of Energy/Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, the site offers tips, mileage calcula-
tors, news and feature stories, and tools to help you find the lowest gas 
prices in your region.
 
✓ www.epa.gov/fueleconomy: The United States Environmental 
Protection Agency’s official subsection of its Web site treats all things 
fuel economy — with links to news, guides to increase your car’s fuel 
efficiency, and other, related content.
 
✓ http://ecomodder.com: The site bills itself as “an automotive com-
munity where performance is judged by fuel economy rather than power 
and speed.” The site offers more than 100 hypermiling tips, a discussion 
forum, and a garage where fellow hypermilers post their vehicles’ cur-
rent mileage, thanks to modifications they’ve made to their cars (and 
future mods they intend to make).
 
✓ www.cleanmpg.com: Check out news, reviews, member mileage logs, 
and a forum for discussing topics such as ways of increasing fuel

Tricking Out Your Car with 
Efficiency Gizmos
Maintaining, monitoring, and motoring along with the help of eco-oriented auto 
gadgets can help you save gas and money, and in the case of the second pair in 
the following list, save yourself from distractions and possible mishaps.
If matching smaller, more energy-efficient auto surround systems with the 
latest compact, fuel-efficient hybrids sounds like a good idea to you, take a 
look at the following sidebar, “Driving music to greener ears.”
The following gadgets are examples of different ways you can green your ride:
 
✓ Kiwi “drive green” computer: Plug the PLX Kiwi computer into your 
car’s service port and then start driving like a hypermiler, thanks to the 
gizmo’s series of lesson plans designed to help you optimize your driv-
ing behavior to maximize fuel efficiency.
 
 The PLX Kiwi monitors your car’s vitals and your driving style, and 
the lessons teach greener motoring techniques that focus on smooth-
ness, drag, acceleration, and deceleration. PLX estimates that you 
can increase your fuel efficiency as much as 33 percent. Visit www.
plxkiwi.com.
 
✓ Iqua Vizor SUN and LG solar Bluetooth car kit: Soaking up the sun 
through the front windshield is how these two Bluetooth speakerphone 
kits get their charge. If your mobile phone can dial calls by listening to 
your voice, one of these kits can cut the distraction — and danger — 
normally associated with fiddling with your phone while driving.
 
 The Iqua model clips to your car’s sun visor — perfect for picking up 
your voice but a little counterintuitive because you must set it on your 
dashboard so that the sun can reach its solar panel when it’s time for 
a recharge. Iqua estimates that you can talk for as long as 20 hours 
between charges. Check it out at www.iqua.com.
 
 The LG solution mounts to your windshield, giving you one hour of talk 
time for every 2 hours of exposure, for an estimated 16 total hours of 
talk time. Go to www.lge.com to find out more.
 
✓ Coffee cup power inverter: Parking the PowerLine power-inverting cup 
in your car’s drink holder, shown in Figure 12-1, provides two 120-volt AC 
outlets to juice household gear such as TVs, video game consoles, or other 
devices you would normally plug into a wall outlet. A USB port can keep 
your mobile phone or other portable gadget charged up so that you’re good 
to go when you get where you’re going. Visit www.powerline.com.

✓ Accutire digital programmable tire gauge: Maintaining the correct 
pressure in your car’s tires can go a long way toward helping you 
achieve better fuel efficiency. Checking your tire pressure with the 
Accutire digital tire gauge (http://measurement-ltd.com) takes the 
guesswork or inaccuracy out of old-fashioned mechanical gauges, and 
the built-in LED flashlight makes using it at night a breeze.
 
✓ CarChip Pro: Skipping in-car displays (such as the ScanGauge II, at the end 
of this list), the CarChip Pro plugs into your car’s on-board diagnostics port 
(ODB), typically located beneath the steering wheel or dashboard.
 
 As you drive, the CarChip Pro (www.davisnet.com) reads and stores 
data from your car’s on-board computer, continuously logging driving 
and engine performance. You read your car’s results by unplugging the 
CarChip Pro from your car and plugging it into your computer’s USB 
port and running the included program.
 
✓ Spotlight rechargeable flashlight: Put your car’s cigarette lighter to 
greener, healthier-living use by swapping in this tiny but superbright 
rechargeable flashlight. The shining little wonder can burn for as long 
as two hours before you need to plug it back in for a recharge. Go to 
www.12vspotlight.com.
 
✓ ScanGauge II 3-in-1 automotive computer: Staying on top of your car’s 
vital statistics can help you squeeze out more miles per gallon between 
fill-ups. The ScanGauge II (www.scangauge.com) taps into your car’s 
every efficiency-related factor to provide real-time feedback such as 
miles per gallon, fuel/distance to empty, horsepower, cost per mile and 
trip, and troubleshooting data so that you can fix your ride when the 
Check Engine light appears.

 Chapter 12: Getting Green Gadgets for on the Go
Tapping into GPS and Mobile Phone 
Applications for Green Getting-around
A global positioning system (GPS) navigator in your car can help you get 
where you’re going in the most fuel- and time-efficient manner. To find out 
more about GPS issues, check out GPS For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Joel 
McNamara (Wiley Publishing). You can use a GPS navigator to calculate your 
route in multiple ways: by getting directions based on factors such as taking 
the fastest or shortest route and skipping toll highways and roads. You can 
also map out routes for walking or biking.
Most portable GPS navigators come with hardware for mounting them on 
your car’s dashboard or to the windshield. (Note, however, that a windshield 
mount can tip off thieves that your gadget might be in the glove box, as the 
following sidebar “Stop that GPS thief!” points out.) if you don’t have GPS, 
don’t feel left out. Pull on up to the nearby sidebar, “Picking up poor man’s 
GPS — sort of,” to learn about mobile apps and Web sites you can use even if 
you don’t have a GPS device.
 
The GPS mapping programs bundled with mobile phones (such as T-Mobile’s 
G1 or Apple’s iPhone) don’t typically offer spoken turn-by-turn directions or 
some of the other features found on dedicated navigators. They do offer scal-
able color maps and point-to-point directions, as shown in Figure 12-2. Of 
course, you can always add the turn-by-turn direction capability to your 
mobile phone — for a price — as I describe in the upcoming section, “Talking 
mobile phone GPS navigator apps.”
Driving music to greener ears
Making its debut performance in the Chevrolet 
Volt, the Extended-Range Electric Vehicle 
from General Motors is the new Bose Energy 
Efficient Series audio sound system.
Bose (www.bose.com) claims the following 
numbers for this in-car sound gear, compared 
to typical sound systems:
 ✓ 30 percent smaller
 ✓ 40 percent lighter
 ✓ 50 percent less energy usage
Bose achieves the series’ design goals by using 
smaller and more efficient components. To cut 
energy consumption in half, Bose employs high-
motor-force speakers, advanced switching 
amplification, and proprietary control circuitry. 
Because the components are smaller and lighter, 
overall vehicle mass is decreased, which can 
help increase fuel efficiency. The Bose Energy 
Efficient Series sound system meets the demands 
of smaller, more energy-efficient vehicles while 
providing quality sound — and that’s music to 
any energy-conscious driver’s ears.

Stop that GPS thief!
Newsflash: GPS navigators have taken the 
top spot as the number-one item snatched 
from cars. According to the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, portable-navigation-snatching 
rose 700 percent between 2006 and 2008, where 
nearly 25,000 of the good-direction-givers were 
illegally separated from their rightful owners.
A 2007 study cited that spotting a suction-cup 
mount on the inside windshield motivates 
many a thief to break in and grab GPS naviga-
tors tucked in glove boxes or beneath seats 
(thoughtfully grabbing anything else they can 
get their hands on as well, of course).
Removing your GPS navigator’s windshield 
mount can make it seem less noticeable, how-
ever the suction-cup mark left behind may be an 
even bigger lure because it means you’re hiding 
something the thieves are looking to get their 
hands on. Wiping away the suction cup mark is 
one option, as is switching to a friction mount 
that’s easy to remove from the dashboard and 
secret in the glove box with your navigator if 
you still prefer to leave it behind when you exit 
the car.

 Chapter 12: Getting Green Gadgets for on the Go
Talking mobile phone GPS navigator apps
Buying and installing GPS navigator programs on your mobile phone or PDA 
can give your trusty gadget the ability to say directions out loud. You can run 
the programs on mobile phones that don’t have built-in GPS by purchasing 
an optional (and external) Bluetooth GPS receiver.
Mobile GPS navigator applications that like to be seen and heard include
 
✓ AmAze: This free GPS navigation program has turn-by-turn voice direc-
tions, for a variety of GPS-equipped smartphones and PDAs, including 
Blackberry, LG, Samsung, Sony Ericsson, and Windows Mobile. Visit 
http://amazegps.com.
 
✓ ALK Copilot Live 7: Provides natural voice directions in 20 languages 
on a number of Pocket PC or Windows Mobile smartphones. Check out 
http://alk.com.
 
✓ MapQuest Mobile Navigator: Voice-guided GPS navigation service is 
offered by several of the major wireless carriers for about $50 per year.
 
✓ Voice TeleNav GPS Navigator: This one is available from all major 
mobile carriers for around $10 per month for unlimited service. TeleNav 
(http://telenav.com) provides turn-by-turn driving directions, both 
onscreen and by voice, on a number of popular GPS-equipped mobile 
phones, including Blackberry, HTC, Motorola, Palm, and other models.
Picking up poor man’s GPS — sort of
Downloading or tapping into one or more of 
these free mobile-phone mapping programs 
and Web sites can help you find directions even 
if you don’t have GPS:
 ✓ Google Maps (http://google.
com/m): A mini-version of Google Maps 
is part of a suite of several Google Mobile 
apps, including Gmail, Calendar, Earth, 
Photos, Translate, and YouTube.
 ✓ MapQuest 4 Mobile (h t t p : / /
mapquest.com/mq4m): This freebie 
mobile phone application provides an 
easy-to-use interface for finding direc-
tions, maps, aerial imagery, and traffic 
information.
 ✓ MapQuest for Mobile Web (mapquest.

Portable GPS navigators
Here are three portable GPS navigators that can literally tell you how to get 
where you want to go in the most efficient way:
 
✓ TomTom GO 930: Not only does the TomTom GO 930, shown in Figure 
12-3, say out loud where and when to turn, but you can also tell it an 
address you want to visit by speaking aloud. The Map Share feature lets 
you update your maps according to up-to-the-minute changes (such as 
road closings or under-construction hours) that other drivers can see, 
and you can see their updates. Visit www.tomtom.com.
 
Figure 12-3: 
Speak and 
ye shall find.
 
 
 Getting traffic updates requires the purchase of the optional RDS-TMC 
receiver, which is standard equipment in the pricier GO 930T. Cueing 
you to get in the correct lane before upcoming turns is one of the gad-
get’s special talents, and built-in Bluetooth means you can pair your 
mobile phone with the GO 930 and use it as a handsfree speakerphone. 
(That’s what I’m talkin’ about!)
 
✓ Garmin Nuvi 880: As with the TomTom GO 930, you can tell the Garmin 
Nuvi 800 where you want to go by simply saying so, out loud. Thanks 
to the gizmo’s multipersonality design and small form factor, the Nuvi 
800 (www.garmin.com) is one GPS navigator you’re not likely to leave 
behind when you get out of the car.
 
 That’s because it also plays MP3 music and audio books, converts cur-
rency and measurements, displays photo slide shows, and can keep you 
entertained with a slew of games, including Sudoku, Solitaire, and Video 
Poker. Pairing your mobile phone with the Nuvi 880’s built-in Bluetooth 
capability automatically copies your phone book, making it easier for 
you to keep your eyes on the road to make and take calls without taking 
your hands off the wheel.

203
 Chapter 12: Getting Green Gadgets for on the Go
 
✓ Magellan Maestro 4370: Taking a page from your mobile phone’s speed-
dial function, the Magellan Maestro 4370 OneTouch feature can quickly 
pull up directions for favorite destinations (such as restaurants or busi-
nesses) with, well, a single touch of your finger.
 
 Staying on top of traffic conditions is easier if you have help from the 
RDS/TMC receiver built into the gadget’s bundled car charger. AAA 
reviews of hotels and restaurants make it a cinch to call and make a res-
ervation, using the Maestro 4370’s Bluetooth handsfree function, with-
out even touching your mobile phone.
 
 Like the Garmin Nuvi 880, the Maestro 4370 also plays music, and it one-
ups the Nuvi by entertaining you with video you can load on it — after 
you park the car, of course! Check out www.magellangps.com.
GPS and green mobile phone apps
In addition to the GPS navigation applications mentioned a few pages back, 
the following seven mobile phone apps that also tap into GPS can help you 
minimize your car’s carbon footprint — and your own:
 
✓ Carbon-Meter: Coming soon for Google Android and Blackberry smart-
phones, the iPhone version of Carbon-Meter rewards your ecofriendly 
activities and efforts with coupons and specials sponsored by local 
advertisers, as shown in Figure 12-4. Run, walk, or bike your way to 
increase your ecosavings — and your savings account! Visit www.
viralmesh.com/carbon-meter.
 
✓ Ecorio: Running on a Google Android-based mobile phone near you, 
Ecorio (http://ecorio.org) taps into the phone’s GPS feature to track 
your personal carbon footprint. Choosing your mode of travel — car, bus 
or train, or bike — determines how seriously green you are about getting 
around.
 
 Ecorio suggests carpool options by matching up drivers and passengers, 
lets fellow greener-gadgeteers keep tabs on one another (in the same 
town or across the country), and offers an option to buy carbon offsets 
by way of Carbonfund.org.
 
✓ greenMeter: This iPhone and iPod Touch application can help you 
lower your car’s effect on the environment by weighing parameters such 
as your vehicle’s tonnage and the price of gas against how you drive. 
Tapping into the iPhone’s built-in accelerometer to gauge the car’s rate 
of forward acceleration, greenMeter calculates vehicle readings such 
as miles-per-gallon fuel efficiency and carbon footprint. Visit http://
hunter.pairsite.com/greenmeter.

✓ iNap: As someone who has more than a few times missed a bus stop 
because the motion lulled me into a nap, the iPhone app iNap is a wake-
up call to staying awake on the bus.
 
 Tapping into the iPhone’s GPS radio, iNap tracks my location and 
sounds an alarm as I’m nearing my final stop. Unfortunately, GPS recep-
tion doesn’t reach underground to the subway, so for those treks I’m on 
my own as far as catching myself catnapping.
 
✓ ShopSavvy: If you’re using a phone that runs the Google Android plat-
form, you’re in luck when it comes to savvier shopping. Point your 
phone at the bar code of any product, and ShopSavvy searches for the 
best price at stores near you, thanks to the gadget’s GPS location finder, 
which keeps track of where you are and what’s in the vicinity.
 
 Pick the closest location with the lowest price, and save time and gas 
now that you’re not running around all over the place looking for the 
best deal in town. Check it out at www.biggu.com.

✓ UbiGreen: Presently a research project and not yet something you can 
hold in your hand, UbiGreen (http://dub.washington.edu/
projects/ubigreen) gauges how you get around to calculate how 
much CO2 you saved during the week. Glancing at the UbiGreen back-
ground running on your cellphone, as shown in Figure 12-5, can help 
put your best foot forward as you take steps to reduce your carbon 
footprint.
 
✓ Tracky: Aimed at helping you navigate during off-road activities such as 
hiking, biking, skiing, driving, and camping, Tracky displays a large com-
pass for staying on course, as shown in Figure 12-6. You can also let the 
program guide you to points of interest by voice — speaking of which,

Tracking Green Gadgets for Fitness 
and Outdoor Activities
When you head out for a run, bike ride, or camping trip into the wild, you 
probably take a gadget (or two) along with you. You can maximize your per-
formance and comfort — while minimizing your carbon footprint — if those 
gadgets are of the green variety.
 
Although some of these products get their charge from the sun or elbow-
grease — and can be used to recharge your other gadgets — none is solely 
designed for recharging per se. (Those gadgets get their own day in the sun in 
the next section, “Staying in Charge with Portable Power Chargers and 
Extenders.”).
In this section I show you a gaggle of green gadgets for various outdoor activ-
ities and purposes:
 
✓ BodyGard Survivor 12-in-1 self-powered emergency companion: One 
of the BodyGard Survivor’s list of features is its carrying strap. That may 
be stretching things a bit, but I still wish I had had one of these items 
when I was a Boy Scout.

 Winding the hand crank charges the battery, which powers the gad-
get’s flashlight, panic alarm, FM radio, and red emergency flasher. Set 
the motion-activated security alarm to scare off things that go bump 
(or roar) in the night outside your tent. To give your MP3 player or 
cellphone a much-needed boost, plug them into the charging outlet. 
Nontechnical amenities include a signaling mirror and a compass. Visit 
www.swisstechtools.com.
 
✓ 2C Solar Light Cap and Everlite powered LED headlamp: The Solar 
Light Cap (http://solarlightcap.com), shown in Figure 12-7, can 
keep your head cool by day and give you a light to read or work by at 
night. A solar cell on the upper bill soaks up sunlight to charge the cap’s 
built-in battery. Come darkness, press the button to turn on dual LED 
lights — which can run as long as 24 hours on a single charge when used 
at dimmer levels. Switched to full brightness, the cap’s lights can last as 
long as four hours.
 
Figure 12-7:

 Another solar light to wrap your head around — or to wrap around 
your head — is the Everlite solar headlamp (http://newlite.com). 
Six hours of sunlight on the solar panel provides 12 or more hours of 
bright LED light. Being unbound rather than sewn in, such as the 2C Cap, 
makes the Everlite headlamp a more flexible solution for the rest of us.
 
✓ Goblin Aero 150 MPG: The Goblin Aero (www.goblinmotors.com) is a 
velomobile, which you peddle like a bike — or switch on the power-assist 
system to take a load off as you cruise under sunny or rainy skies, thanks 
to the protective screen and skins. Goblin estimates you get up to 150 
MPG from its ultra-efficient gasoline engine, or opt for the EcoSpeed elec-
tric drive system to cut the Aero’s carbon emissions to zero.
 
✓ Solar Rechargeable Lantern AM/FM weather radio: Set the Solar 
Rechargeable Lantern (www.solarhome.org), shown in Figure 12-8, 
in the sun for 8 hours, and enjoy up to 12 hours of light while listening 
to tunes, news, or weather reports on a built-in radio. The solar panel 
folds away when you’re not charging the lantern; a wall charger and car-
lighter-plug charger are included so that you can charge up before head-
ing into the wild.

Staying in Charge with Portable 
Power Chargers and Extenders
Portable power chargers and extenders can help you keep your gadgets 
charged and usable when you’re away from a power source that you can plug 
in to. The ones I describe here are ecofriendly because they rely on the sun 
(or wind) for a charge, or on good old-fashioned elbow grease to wind built-in 
cranks to charge them. They can then in turn charge your gadgets. In other 
words, these gadgets turn natural energy or your energy into energy you can 
use to power your other gadgets:
 
✓ Solio Magnesium Edition solar charger: Unfold the “petals” of the Solio 
Magnesium Edition portable solar charger (www.solio.com), shown 
in Figure 12-9, and you see three solar panels that soak up the sun to 
give renewed recharge life to your gadget. Use the Solio to recharge 
MP3 players, cellphones, digital cameras, handheld video-game players, 
and many other gadgets. Fully charged, the Solio can recharge a typical 
mobile phone more than twice, or provide more than 20 hours of MP3 
music.

Leafing Through Green Garments, 
Bags, and Cases
Green gadget choices don’t have to stop with the gadgets themselves. Cases, 
holders, backpacks, and other toting choices have become part of the whole 
green gadget ecosphere, thanks to the growing selection of green accessory 
products.
I sing the body electric
Max Donelan (shown kneeling in the photo) 
is an assistant professor of kinesiology at 
Simon Fraser University near Vancouver, 
British Columbia. As chief science officer and 
director of Bionic Power Inc. (www.bionic
power.com), he and his team developed 
the Biomechanical Energy Harvester, a wear-
able technology that unobtrusively generates 
electricity from the natural motion of walking 
and uses it to charge a wide range of portable 
battery-powered devices.
Bionic Power
Weighing 31/2 pounds, the Biomechanical Energy 
Harvester prototype would be too heavy to wear 
comfortably for more than a little while. Mr. 
Donelan said his team is aiming to bring the weight 
to just under 2 pounds, or 900 grams — the magic 
number he came up with after working with ath-
letic-brace companies, which discovered that pro 
football players could perform without hindrance 
when a brace weighed less than a kilogram.
Mr. Donelan envisions early adopters of his 
product as people whose lives literally depend 
on portable power, such as military personnel 
or public-safety workers and first responders. 
Simply put, if you can be the recharger, you can 
create all the battery juice you want.
The idea came to Mr. Donelan and his col-
league and friend Art Kuo about a decade ago, 
after reading an article about energy harvest-
ing. Because of their main scientific interest in 
how people walk, the team thought they could 
get a lot more power from the body by focus-
ing on the knee joint, essentially harnessing the 
energy for free without putting undue demands 
of the wearer. He compares the concept to 
regenerative braking in hybrid cars.
Although he believed he would be the only 
person who would walk around all day with the 
contraption on his body, Mr. Donelan said many 
of the people he has spoken to about the device 
said they would not only wear it but would also 
wear it conspicuously. Mr. Donelan calls it the 
Prius effect, to make it plainly known to others 
that the wearer is generating her own power.

Although the companies listed in these bullets typically offer other choices to 
match the wide-ranging gamut of gadgets in our lives, I have chosen a small 
batch of ecofriendly products to describe here:
 
✓ ScotteVest Solar recharging jacket: Gadget-geek jacket maker 
ScotteVest (http://scottevest.com) has made a gizmo-savvy gar-
ment that’s designed to keep your mobile phone and other portable gad-
gets charged on sunny days. Its secret is a big solar panel on the back. 
You can also detach the panel and set it in the sun when the weather’s 
too hot for full coverage. The panel charges a battery that’s secreted 
inside the jacket. Tons of additional hidden compartments and tunnels 
for routing your headphone wires can keep you in charge and in style at 
the same time.
 
✓ Voltic solar backpacks and bags: Solar bags in the Voltic line (www.
voltaicsystems.com) come with built-in rechargeable batteries that 
store the energy the panels soak up from the sun, as shown in Figure 
12-11. The bags’ overall greenness is increased by the fact that the fabric 
is made from recycled plastic bottles.

✓ Eclipse Solar Gear: The company offers a wide selection of backpacks, 
messenger bags, laptop and camera cases, and even a solar fishing-
tackle bag. Although you can carry your notebook in one of the Eclipse 
messenger bags, the company says that the solar panel can’t generate 
enough energy to charge it. It can, however, charge your cellphone, 
MP3 player, digital camera, or camcorder. Visit http://eclipse

W
hat could be more fun than shopping for new, green consumer elec-
tronics? Couple that fun with the satisfaction of replacing dying and 
not-so-green high-tech gear with green new models, and you have a win-win 
situation. And that’s what this chapter is all about. Chapters 14 and 16 can 
help you get rid of your unwanted gear the responsible way. (That would 
make a win-win-win situation.)
For starters, I tell you about some of the gadgets you can buy to monitor and 
manage your household’s “bigger picture” energy usage. Next, I take you on 
a tour of the latest products that exemplify just what it means to be gadgetry 
greener in the house. I describe new, more energy-efficient HDTVs, savings-savvy 
timers, and even motion-detecting gizmos that automatically turn lights on or off. 
There’s something here for everyone — and every room — in the house.
Considering Green Gadgets for 
Every Room in the House
Some energy-saving gizmos, such as the smart power strips I write about 
in several other chapters, are right at home in every room in the house. 
Plugging your powered gadgets and other consumer electronics into a smart 
power switch can make it easier to completely power off several “energy 
vampires” at once.

The power-switching gadgets in this list can be used separately, or mixed 
and matched for greater control over turning the devices you’ve plugged into 
them on and off:
 
✓ Universal TrickleSaver: Powering off the DVD player, video game con-
sole, and other components connected to your TV is the magic act the 
TrickleSaver (http://tricklestar.com), shown in Figure 13-1, per-

✓ Westek indoor power strip timer: The Westek indoor power strip timer 
can turn on and off lights and other items plugged into it, depending on 
times you tell it to do its switching thing. The timer controls four of the 
power strip’s eight outlets, and a hinged protective cover prevents acci-
dental timing mishaps. Visit www.amertac.com.
 
✓ Belkin Conserve: Bending over to reach a power strip that’s on the floor 
and hard to reach is why many people don’t bother turning off power 
strips. Coming to your back’s rescue is the Belkin Conserve, at http://
belkin.com.
 
 Press the remote control to instantly turn on or off the devices plugged 
into six of the strip’s eight outlets. The remaining pair of outlets stays on 
all the time so that you can keep on around the clock certain devices — 
such as your cable or DSL modem and WiFi router.

 Chapter 13: Adding Green Gadgets around the House
Monitoring and Controlling 
Household Energy Usage
A home energy monitor provides real-time feedback about how much energy 
your home’s powered parts are using. These gizmos typically display power 
usage in terms of actual kilowatts, and estimate what it’s costing you on your 
monthly electric bill. Studies have shown that energy monitors can help moti-
vate you to reduce your dwelling’s total power consumption 4 to 15 percent.
Connecting an energy monitor may be as simple as plugging your individual 
power-consuming devices into a handheld model to gauge their usage one 
by one, or as involved as opening your circuit breaker box to clamp sensors 
around the incoming power lines and connect wires to two breaker points (as 
shown in Figure 13-2). For this type of energy monitor installation, you might 
want to hire an electrician to do the job.

Only a professional electrician or Do-It-Yourself type who has experience with 
electrical systems — and the good sense to cut the main power — should 
attempt to install the kind of energy monitor sensors shown in Figure 13-2.
Some portable energy monitors gauge power usage on a gadget-by-gadget 
basis, which can help you determine how each one contributes to your 
home’s energy consumption. Then you know which gadgets to use more 
efficiently or possibly replace with a more efficient one. The two portable 
and whole-home energy monitors described here illustrate how installing 
and using one of these gizmos in your home can help you stay on top of your 
energy usage:
 
✓ Kill A Watt: Wondering just how much power that room heater or 
printer is drawing when it’s turned on — and turned off? Plug your 
gadgets or any other electrically powered item into the Kill A Watt, and 
instantly find out how many watts it draws, and how much it contributes 
to your monthly electric bill. Visit www.p3international.com.
 
✓ The Energy Detective: Skipping the plug-it-in approach, The Energy 
Detective, shown in Figure 13-3, taps directly into your home’s circuit 
breaker and displays how much total power you’re using — and paying 
for — in real time. Turning on and off appliances and other gadgets 
reveals how much each is adding to your overall load. Go to www.
theenergydetective.com.

Turning Things On and Off Automatically
Gadgets that turn the lights on and off automatically when you enter and 
leave a room, or a thermostat that heats or cools only when you’re home, can 
go a long way toward reducing your monthly electricity bill. Some of these 
energy-saving automatons are simple to use. Others require the installation 
services of a professional electrician.
The products I highlight in the following list illustrate a number of green 
options that remember or sense when to cut the power so that you don’t 
have to. (How’s that’s for green gadget re-thinking?)
 
✓ Honeywell 5-2 day programmable thermostat: Swapping your manual 
thermostat with the Honeywell 5-2 day programmable thermostat lets 
you set heating and cooling temperatures — and then forget them.
 
 Set it to turn up the heat or air conditioner a few minutes before you 
wake, turn it down when you head off to work, kick it up a few notches 
when you’re home again, then adjust the temperature again at bedtime 
for a comfortable and energy-efficient night of sleep. Sleeping in on the 
weekend? No worries — setting the Honeywell to keep you warm or cool 
beyond your usual wake up time is par for the course. Go to http://
yourhome.honeywell.com.
 
✓ GreenSwitch: Leaving the job to the GreenSwitch power control system 
makes unplugging as easy as hitting a wall-mounted or remote power 
switch.
 
 Only the outlets you set by power zones turn off when you hit the 
switch, and your home’s air conditioning and heating are automati-
cally set to the unoccupied mode for more energy savings. Professional 
installation is required and can take as little as an hour before you’re 
on the smart- switching road to energy recovery. Visit http://green-
switchteam.com.
 
✓ Motion-detecting lights and switches: Having lights automatically turn 
on or off when you enter and leave the room saves energy and frees your 
hands for carrying laundry or other things. Simply screw the Motion Bulb 
into a light socket and presto, instant sensing as you come and go.
 
 Drawing only 20 watts when on, one Motionbulb (www.motionbulb.
com) can last up to 5 years — which saves you from replacing about 10 
ordinary light bulbs.
 
✓ The SensorPlug motion-sensing outlet: This product can provide auto-
matic on and off switching when you walk in and out of a room for table 
and floor lamps, radios, and anything else you plug into it. Check it out

Investigating my home’s balance of power
Warning: Don’t try installing The Energy 
Detective at home, folks. Unless, that is, you’re 
versed in working with electricity — and you’ve 
cut the power completely to your circuit breaker 
before you begin.
With that out of the way, I can tell you that 
installing The Energy Detective (www.the
energydetective.com) to monitor my 
tiny home’s power consumption was not diffi-
cult. However, I was a wee bit nervous about 
screwing sensor wires into my circuit breaker 
(see Figure 13-2) even though I cut the main 
power to the box. To reiterate, paying an elec-
trician can reduce the chances of accidentally 
frying yourself when poking around in your 
home’s circuit breaker. (Is there such a thing 
as intentionally frying yourself when . . . wait, 
let’s not go there!)
Here are the steps I took to install The Energy 
Detective:
 1. Turned off main circuit breaker power 
switch.
 2. Removed circuit breaker panel cover.
 3. Mounted the Measuring Transmitting Unit 
(MTU) using double-sided tape..
 4. Connected black wire to a 20 amp circuit 
breaker in the panel.
 5. Connected white wire to neutral bus in the 
panel.
 6. Clamped the pair of Current Transformers 
(CT) over incoming power lines, making 
sure to align sides with red dot in same 
direction to maintain proper polarity.
 7. Connected CT cable to MTU.
 8. Taped slack lengths of wires against back 
of circuit breaker panel because I’m a bit of 
a neat freak.
 9. Turned on the main circuit breaker switch 
and noted the green LED on the MTU was 
flashing once per second, which meant it 
was picking up the flow of power through 
the cables.
 10. Set the MTU’s “house code” on the TED 
Receiving Unit Display (RUD) so that it was 
certain to track my home’s electricity and 
not my neighbor’s (in the unlikely event that 
they also happen to be using a TED).
 11. Looked at the TED display and saw that, low 
and behold, the little sucker was tracking 
my home’s real-time power consumption.
 12. Turned off the main circuit breaker switch 
and reinstalled the panel cover.
 13. Turned on the main circuit breaker and 
observed my house’s base consump-
tion rate* of around .100 kilowatts, which 
increased when I turned on my
 ✓ Printer by printing a page, waking it from 
standby mode = 1.110 kilowatts
 ✓ Standup 1500 watt radiator set to Max 
mode at the highest setting = 1.500 to 2.500 
kilowatts
 ✓ Ecofriendly tankless instant hot water

 ✓ Electric oven = 3.750 kilowatts
 ✓ Xbox 360 and 32-inch HDTV = .310 kilowatts 
(to my surprise there was no jump in con-
sumption when I spun the DVD drive by 
popping in a movie)
 ✓ Toaster oven = 1.350 kilowatts
 ✓ Microwave oven = 1.770 kilowatts
 ✓ Ecofriendly washer/dryer all -in-one while 
running hot water cycle = 18.550 kilowatts, 
1.170 kilowatts during wash cycle without

Controlling Your Entire House with 
Home Automation Systems
Home automation involves the automatic — and, through your computer or 
another device, remote — control of various functions within your home. 
Home automation systems can make your household green because they can 
manage energy usage on your behalf, automatically adjusting your home’s 
thermostat or turning appliances off based on your schedule. They can also 
turn lights on and off, control your home entertainment system, and auto-
matically water your plants when you’re on vacation.
An automated security system might include sensors that can detect intrud-
ers or fire and smoke and then trigger your home automation system to dial 
for help, flash the lights, and sound an alarm. In addition, most home automa-
tion systems allow you to control the following:
 
✓ Intercoms and video cameras
 
✓ Heating and air conditioning
 
✓ Coffee makers
hot water flowing in, and around 1.400 
during drying cycle, which can take 1 to 3 
hours, depending on load
 ✓ Refrigerator turning itself on to adjust inte-
rior temperature = 260 kilowatts
 ✓ Writing desk lamp = .120 kilowatts + sofa 
reading lamp = .140 + third room lamp = .160
 ✓ Front porch light = .140 kilowatts + side 
house light = .160 kilowatts
 ✓ Vudu Video Store in a Box movie player + 
32-inch HDTV = .270 kilowatts
 ✓ Backup hard drive turning itself on to 
run Time Machine program to back up 
MacBook = .110 to .120 kilowatts
 ✓ The Energy Detective alone with all other 
appliances, lights, and energy vampires cut 
off = .20 kilowatts
*Plugged in active and standby (energy vampire) 
appliances and devices when gauging .100 kilo-
watt baseline consumption rate include power 
strips with powered-on MacBook charging iPhone 
and Bluetooth headset via USB, active cable 
broadband modem, active WiFi network router, 
active HDMI port-switching box, HDTV in standby

Home automation systems communicate by sending unique data signals 
through your home’s power lines, turning your home’s wiring into a virtual 
network of sorts. For a slightly more technical explanation, pop over to the 
nearby sidebar, “How home automation talks itself to sleep.” Controlling your 
home automation system when you’re away from home can be accomplished 
by running a mobile application, such as the one by Crestron for the iPhone, 
shown in Figure 13-4, or by tapping into your system by way of the Web.
 
Generally, you can easily install basic home automation gizmos and computer 
programs (such as the popular X10 system) to control lights and your living 
room’s home theater. More sophisticated home automation systems for moni-
toring and controlling window blinds, heating and air conditioning, and fire, 
smoke, and security alarm systems typically require professional installers.
How home automation talks itself to sleep
Devices plugged into receiver boxes or out-
lets communicate back and forth with prepro-
grammed or real-time commands you send 
from your PC, remote, or cellphone. So telling 
the night light in Junior’s room to go to sleep 
at a predetermined time is merely a matter of 
sending the signal through your home’s electri-
cal lines.
In addition to the radio frequency (RF) signals 
running through your home’s power wire “net-
work,” home automation systems typically con-
nect to your home network’s router by way of 
Ethernet or WiFi, which is how you access and 
control everything with your PC, home automa-
tion remote control, or cellphone.
A number of communications protocols are 
what your home’s lights, appliances, and other 
connected devices use to talk with each other 
and your PC, remote control, and cellphone. 
Some send and receive commands through your 
home’s electrical wiring, as described above.
Some remote controls beam infrared (IF) signals 
to control device the way typical TV remotes do, 
while others use RF signals that don’t require a 
line of site between the remote and the device.
One popular protocol, X10, is named after 
the company (www.x10.com) that, in 1974, 
invented the home automation system bearing 
the same name.

 Chapter 13: Adding Green Gadgets around the House
 
A professional electrician or Do-It-Yourself type who has experience with elec-

 Sony says the set draws 40 percent less power than other LCD models — 
and nearly zero watts when it’s powered off in Standby mode. What’s more, 
a light sensor can automatically adjust the picture brightness to match the 
room’s mood, drawing even less energy when the lights go down and it’s 
time to start the show. Check it out at www.sonystyle.com.
 
✓ Knoll Eco-System GS8 Audio amplifier: Whereas amplifiers and bass-
booming speakers are notoriously famous for being hungry power 
eaters, the Knoll GS8 amplifier (at http://knollsystems.com) can 
save you as much as $100 on your bill when compared to typical amps.
 
 The amplifier’s smart-sensing technology determines which of the box’s 
four pairs of stereo channels are in use, delivering only to those chan-
nels needing it. Comparable amplifiers without the same smarts con-
sume about 14 times (40 watts) as much power when idling, but the GS8 
draws only 4 watts. Sounds green to me!
 
✓ Sony’s BDP-S350 Blu-ray: Powering on the Sony BDP-S350 Blu-ray player 
and opening the tray to pop in a movie takes only six seconds when the 
quick-start option is turned on.
 
 But turning it off can lower the player’s energy vampire draw to less 
than a third of a watt, which translates to just over thirty cents a month 
to operate based on five hours of daily use. Leaving the quick-start 
option on decreases startup time but increases the estimated monthly 
cost to about a buck. Visit www.sony.com.
 
✓ EZ Power Wind-Up Remote Control: Thirty twists to the dial of the EZ 
Power Wind-Up Remote Control fully charges the gizmo for as much as 
seven days of use.
 
 The remote can control as many as six components, including TVs, 
cable boxes, and DVD players, which means fewer rechargeable bat-
teries to power the six unneeded remotes. Available only in the United 
Kingdom at the time of this writing, diehard green home theater buffs 
willing to spring for overseas shipping can get their hands on one from 
Amazon UK. Go to http://amazon.co.uk.
 
✓ Netflix Player by Roku: Energy-saving Blu-ray players are better than 
old-school players for helping to save the environment, but don’t forget 
how much energy is expended to produce, pick, and return rental-store 
DVDs — or ship them through the mail the Netflix way. Skipping the disc 
completely is how the Netflix Player by Roku, shown in Figure 13-5, offers 
the green way of watching movies in your home. Go to www.roku.com.
 
 Sign-on to your Netflix account on your computer, browse a selection 
of more than 20,000 Watch Instantly titles and click the ones you want. 
Then grab a bowl of popcorn and press Play on the Roku’s remote to 
start watching within about a minute after the movie begins streaming 
to your TV over the Internet. Look, Ma — no more DVD juggling!

Watching green TV shows
Choosing and using green home entertainment 
gear sets the perfect stage for tuning in to these 
green-thinking TV shows:
 ✓ The Green, Sundance Channel: A regularly 
scheduled series of programs — includ-
ing Big Ideas for a Small Planet, and The 
Ecoists — dedicated entirely to the envi-
ronment, plus additional multimedia content 
focusing on ecology and green living on the 
series’ companion Web site. Visit www.
sundancechannel.com/thegreen.
 ✓ It’s Easy Being Green, Fine Living Network: 
An entertaining and informational look at 
the growing green lifestyle and the latest 
trends in sustainable goods, services, and 
technologies, with appearances by eco-
conscious celebrities; hosted by the noted 
organic chef, author, and green lifestyle 
consultant Renee Loux. Go to www.fine-
living.com/fine/its_easy_
being_green.
 ✓ Find & Design, A&E: Part treasure hunt, 
part decorating show, Find & Design shows 
viewers how to bargain like an expert and 
design like a pro armed with a modest 
amount of cash, a list of flea markets, and 
tag sales. Visit www.aetv.com/find
anddesign.
 ✓ Planet Green: Planet Green (http://
planetgreen.discovery.com) is 
the first and only 24-hour ecolifestyle televi-
sion network with a robust online presence 
and community. Launched in June 2008, the 
show offers more than 250 hours of original 
green lifestyle programming. And, their mis-
sion extends online at http://planet
green.discovery.com and its sister 
site, www.treehugger.com.
 ✓ Backyard Habitat, Animal Planet: Teaches 
you how to make the planet a better place 
for animals, one back yard at a time. It also 
builds on the National Wildlife Foundation’s 
ongoing Backyard Wildlife Habitat program, 
which for more than 30 years has inspired 
people to make a home for wildlife right 
outside their back door. Check it out at

✓ Torrent HDMI cables: Unlike most HDMI cables you can buy to connect 
your HDTV, DVD player, video game console, and other hi-def devices, 
the Torrent (http://torrent-inc.com) line of cables are free of 
harmful substances, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and other environ-
mentally unfriendly stuff.
 
✓ The Home Security Television Simulator: Unlike timers that just turn 
lights on and off, the Home Security Television Simulator, shown in 
Figure 13-6, mimics the flickering glow of a television to trick poten-
tial burglars into thinking someone’s home and watching the TV. Visit 
http://hammacher.com.
 
 The phony baloney boob tube mimics scene changes, fades, swells, and 
color shifts of a TV as perceived from outside using a bright multicolor 
LED display diffused with an opalescent lens. Consuming only 2 percent 
of the power a real TV uses, the dummy set is smart enough to turn itself 
on at dusk and off four to seven hours later.

Movie downloads give DVDs the boot
Watching pay-per-view, downloadable, or 
streaming TV episodes and movies is greener 
than renting from the local video store because 
you save on gasoline and time, and eliminate the 
resources used to make and ship the discs from 
store to store and from shipping center to mail-
box. If you want to enjoy your flicks and feel the 
satisfaction of going green, you have plenty of 
choices to download movies (legally, mind you).
Own an Xbox 360 or TiVo HD? Activating either 
by visiting www.netflix.com/activate 
provides you the same access to your Netflix 
Watch Instantly titles without having to shell out 
extra bucks for the Roku player. The Xbox 360 
Live Video Marketplace also offers hundreds of 
standard definition (SD) and high-definition (HD) 
movies and TV shows for purchase or rental. 
The TiVo HD can also tap into thousands of film 
and TV titles available from Amazon’s Video on

Fiddling with Other Ecofriendly 
Home Gadgets
In this section, I give you a handful of wacky, weird, and way out there 
household gadgets for most every room in the house. And when I say, “way 
out there,” I mean some of these gadgets can help you conserve water and 
energy outside the house.
 
✓ Bedol Water Powered Clock: Powered by a splash of water and a dash 
of salt, the Bedol water-powered clock, shown in Figure 13-7, keeps per-
fect time with no batteries. Electrodes inside the gizmo harvest energy 
from the water — though the maker suggests adding a squeeze of lemon 
juice to enhance the water-power drawing efficiency, which translates to 
fewer fill-ups. Go to http://bedolwhatsnext.com.

another way to download and watch movies 
rather than spinning a Blu-ray disc in the video 
game console. Video downloaded from the 
PlayStation Video Store can be transferred from 
the PS3 to the PSP portable handheld gaming 
system for on-the go-entertainment. 
At the time of this writing, Vudu’s Video Store 
in a Box (www.vudu.com) led the download-
able movie player pack with the largest library 
of HD titles. Like the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360, 
movies and TV shows are stored on a built-in 
hard drive. The remote control features a simple 
scrolling wheel design for browsing titles and 
starting, pausing, fast-forwarding, rewinding, 
and stopping movies and shows. 
Download movies and TV shows from the Apple 
Music Store (www.apple.com/itunes) 
right to your iPod or iPhone. Watching the 
same titles on your Windows or Mac computer 
is another option — or move the movie party to 
the big screen in the living room with Apple’s 
Apple TV video, music, and photo player.

✓ Solar-powered holiday lights: Sucking up sunlight by day is how the 
solar-powered holiday lights shown in Figure 13-9 recharge the included 
batteries to shine brightly at night. A full day of light can power the 
26-foot long string of 60 lights for around eight hours, and because 
they’re self-contained, there’s no need for extension cords like ordinary, 
power-sucking holiday lights. Visit www.shopgetorganized.com.

✓ EasyBloom Plant Sensor: Planting the EasyBloom Plant Sensor in your 
garden (shown in Figure 13-10, on the left) can provide precise monitor-
ing of sun, soil, temperature, and humidity — factors which help deter-
mine and adjust watering, light, and soil levels and conditions.
 
 Fortunately, the EasyBloom (http://easybloom.com) does all the fig-
uring so that you don’t have to, thanks to “plant doctor algorithms.” The 
accompanying program runs when you plug the garden gizmo into your 
computer’s USB port, as shown in Figure 13-10, on the right.

Ridding Yourself 
of Gadgets 
the Green Way

In this part . . .
W
hen you want to replace that old PC of yours with 
a newer, ecofriendlier notebook, don’t just dump 
the PC in the trash. Instead, find out whether it can be of 
use to someone else. You can give it to a relative or friend. 
If no one you know wants your cast-off gadget, you can 
donate it, trade it in, or auction it.
No matter how you decide to get rid of the gadget, how-
ever, be sure to erase your personal information from it 
first. Protecting yourself against potential identity theft 
(or just plain embarrassment) is an important topic, 
which is why I dedicate an entire chapter to it.
A possible scenario is one in which a hopelessly useless 
gadget has reached the end of its life cycle. If that’s your 
scenario, I give you some information on locating a nearby 
or nationwide recycler, corporate take-back program, or 
other gadget “e-waste” processing facility.

Chapter 14
Donating, Gifting, and Selling 
Unwanted Gadgets
In This Chapter
▶ Determining whether an unwanted gadget is useful to anyone
▶ Weighing the risks and rewards of donating, gifting, and selling unwanted gadgets
▶ Donating for the right reasons — and the write-off reasons
▶ Evaluating selling, trading-in, and auctioning gadgets you no longer use
T
his chapter’s title says it all, and you’ve come to the right place if you 
want to get rid of gadgets or other electronics devices you think some-
one else can use. I say, “think” because the item you want to get rid of that 
seems valuable to you — that old IBM PC in the garage that boots up from 
floppy disks — in reality has reached the end of its useful lifecycle.
Selling the original Macintosh you used in college, on the other hand, is a 
viable option — even if it’s only because the person who buys it wants to 
turn it into an aquarium rather than use it as a computer.
In this chapter, I help you figure out whether the gadgets and gear you’re 
thinking of discarding are useful to anyone. If so, I help you weigh your many 
options to donate, gift, trade in, or sell your stuff.
 
Wiping your personal information from gadgets, cellphones, computer hard 
drives, and digital cameras before selling or giving them away can protect you 
against potential identity theft — or just plain embarrassment. Chapter 15 has 
all the information you need to erase your personal information from your 
gadgets.
If you determine the things you want to get rid of are hopelessly useless, 
don’t fret. Chapter 16 details what steps to take to dispose of your stuff the 
green way to ensure they’re properly reused or recycled.

236
Part V: Ridding Yourself of Gadgets the Green Way 
Determining whether an Unwanted 
Gadget Is of Use to Anyone
The first step in deciding whether your gadget is of use to someone is figuring 
out whether the items you want to get rid of are useful. The following new (or 
nearly new) gadgets in working condition are almost always useful to others:
 
✓ Computers
 
✓ Cellphones
 
✓ iPods and MP3 players
 
✓ Digital cameras and camcorders
 
✓ Home entertainment gear
Sometimes damaged but still-working (or easily repairable) gadgets and gear 
are of use to others. For instance, getting rid of a reasonably up-to-date com-
puter with a broken monitor makes sense. But giving away or trying to sell 
the broken monitor doesn’t make sense.
Used but still-working gadgets and gear can be useful, and so can broken or 
damaged electronics that have useful parts — like my first-generation iPhone 
shown in Figure 14-1. The night before I was to appear on TV to show off the 
(then) new iPhone 2.0 software, I accidentally knocked my iPhone off my desk 
and onto the hardwood floor. In spite of a spider web of cracks, the screen 
still responded to my touch and the iPhone worked. The next morning, I 
wound up paying a woman $100 to get to the front of a line of hundreds to buy 
a new iPhone 3G, and then raced up to Manhattan to make the 5 p.m. airing on 
Fox News. I wound up selling the original iPhone for more than $200.
 
Running down the following checklist can help you determine whether your 
potential electronic giveaway, donation, or for-sale item is valuable to another 
person.
Repeat after me: “My unwanted gadget or other electronic device is”
 
✓ New or nearly new, and in working condition
 
✓ Not so new but in nice shape and in working condition
 
✓ Kind of old but something I’m certain others would find of use
 
✓ Really old but something I see others selling for a pretty penny on eBay, 
which means I can probably sell mine, too
 
✓ New, but not working because a part is broken or not working and needs 
replacement or repair, to make it good as new again
 
✓ Not so new but in nice shape but not working because of a broken part 
or needed repair that will make it useful again

more than

If you answer Yes to any of these questions, you can ask yourself the next 
question: To give away or to sell?
 
I help you decide which way to go in the next section, but before I get ahead of 
myself, consider the following potential caveats even if your yes was indubita-
bly, undoubtedly, unequivocally YES!:
 
✓ What you may consider “kind of old but something I’m certain others 
would find of use” may not be seen as useful at all by certain organiza-
tions that accept donations such as used PCs.
 
✓ Sending used computers that have at least a Pentium III processor (or 
newer) is often a requirement among many organizations that accept 
computer donations but donating anything older is of no use.
 
✓ Saying no to the two preceding points means that your gadget or other 
electronic device likely falls into the “hopelessly useless” category 
known as e-waste.

238
Part V: Ridding Yourself of Gadgets the Green Way 
 
✓ Don’t despair! The adage “One man’s trash is another man’s treasure” 
can prove true for your e-waste when you drop it off or send it to a repu-
table recycler who can properly process and extract reusable bits and 
pieces.
Weighing the Risks and Rewards 
of Donating, Gifting, and Selling 
Unwanted Gadgets
Giving away your gadgets or other unwanted electronics can reward you 
with that good feeling you get for doing something thoughtful and helpful for 
another person or group.
Selling, auctioning. or trading in your unwanted stuff for cash or credit 
toward a new purchase can also satisfy your green sensibilities — literally 
and figuratively!
 
Either way, you’re honoring the three Rs, by
 
✓ Reducing the amount of resources required to create, ship, and main-
tain new electronic stuff.
 
✓ Reusing a gadget or device you don’t want but someone does.
 
✓ Recycling a still-useful product by keeping it in service and out of the 
recycling bin — or worse, in your local trash stream or a toxic waste 
dump overseas.
The following pluses and minuses of giving away versus getting cash can help 
you decide how to say goodbye to your unwanted gadgets and gear:
 
✓ Give: Giving an unused computer, cellphone, or other gadget to a friend, 
a family member, a coworker, or another person you care about, or just 
plain like, or even a total stranger, can give you that good feeling you get 
by doing something nice for someone else without putting a price tag 
on it.
 
✓ Donate: Gives that same good feeling of just plain giving, but can also 
give back monetarily at tax time in the form of a deduction you can 
claim on your filing form — providing the recipient of your donation is a 
not-for-profit 501(c)(3)-status charity, foundation, or other organization. 
(For more on the fine print of donation deductions, check out the nearby 
sidebar, “Deducing donation deductions.”)

239
 Chapter 14: Donating, Gifting, and Selling Unwanted Gadgets
 
✓ Trade in: Getting rid of your gadgets by sending them to one of several 
Web-based trade-in companies can fatten your wallet with cash, or earn 
you credit toward the purchase of new gadgets and gear the company 
sells. Besides the inconvenience of having to ship your stuff and wait 
for your check or credit to show up, trading in carries the potential — 
albeit, remote — chance that your item gets damaged, stolen, or lost on 
its way to the trade-in company.
 
✓ Sell locally: Listing your unwanted electronics in your local paper’s clas-
sified section or online on a local community listing such as craigslist 
(www.craigslist.org), can add greenbacks to your wallet, without 
the potential inconvenience of shipping or other risks associated with 
online trade-in or auctioning options.
 
✓ Auction: Auctioning your gadgets and electronics on such Web sites 
as eBay, Bonanzle, or eBid, can bring in cash, but potential risks and 
inconveniences can outweigh the benefits if you’re not careful about 
how you list your item, and who you let bid. When it comes to eBay, it’s 
all about reputation, baby: yours (the seller), theirs (the buyer), and the 
shipping service you choose to shuttle the goods between the two of 
you. Eliminating these risks by choosing the “local pickup” option and 
completing the transaction in person can ensure you get your money 
and the buyer gets their goods — assuming someone in your area wants 
what you’re auctioning. Listing items that nobody bids on before the 
auction ends can cost you a goodly sum in fees if you’re auctioning high-
ticket items such as computers and other pricier goods.
Choose the option that sounds like the best fit for you and then read more 
about your choice in the following three sections. You’ll be on your way to 
saying “so long” to your unwanted gadgets in no time.
Deducing donation deductions
According to the Internal Revenue Service IRC 
Section 170, giving your unwanted computers 
and other gadgets to 501(c)(3) organizations, 
such as public charities and certain private 
foundations, can entitle you to deduct up to 50 
percent of your adjusted gross income from 
your itemized tax return. Donating your stuff to 
501(c)(3) organizations that are private founda-
tions generally entitles you to deduct up to 30 
percent of your gross income. Corporations can 
deduct all donations to 501(c)(3) organizations 
up to an amount equal to 10 percent of their tax-
able income.
The deduction for electronics donations is the 
fair market value — the used value in the cur-
rent market. Shipping costs may also be deduc-
table, so remember to ask for a receipt!

240
Part V: Ridding Yourself of Gadgets the Green Way 
 
A few things to keep in mind when getting rid of gadgets and other electronic 
devices are
 
✓ Receipts and warranties: Finding the original receipt and evidence of 
an extended warranty you may have purchased for a gadget you’re get-
ting rid of can be helpful to the person on the receiving end, should the 
gadget require service or repair after you let it go.
 
✓ Manuals, installation discs, and packaging: Locating and including man-
uals, quick start guides, installation discs, cables, original packaging, 
and anything else that came with the gadgets you’re getting rid of can 
be helpful to the person you’re giving to. Plus, you’ll free up clutter and 
materials in your house you would otherwise wind up recycling later.
Giving the Gift of Unwanted Gadgets
What more is there to say about giving unwanted gadgets to friends, family 
members, coworkers, or anyone you know who can benefit from your 
unwanted gadgets?
Not much, except what you already know if you’re the giving type; that your 
action helps another person. For us gadget-giving types, that’s a nice feeling, 
and reward enough.. (I’m a prodigious giver-away-er of unwanted gadgets.)
Well now, wait; there is something else to say on the subject. Giving your 
identity and other personal information away with gadgets that store that 
kind of stuff doesn’t feel so nice. You can read all about the subject in 
Chapter 15.
Doing Good by Donating Computers 
and Other Gadgets
Although donating computers, cellphones, and other gadgets to a local 
group you’re familiar with is one option, it’s often more helpful to send your 
unwanted digital stuff to one of many organizations that matches your give-
aways with others who can benefit the most from them.
The most commonly donated electronic goods are
 
✓ Computers: Organizations that take back computers generally refur-
bish the system by reinstalling or upgrading the operating system and 
repairing faulty hardware, if necessary. The computers are then sent to 
schools, community groups, assistance programs, and even 

241
 Chapter 14: Donating, Gifting, and Selling Unwanted Gadgets
international organizations that work with developing countries that 
have little or no access to computers and the democratic power of the 
Internet. Other useful computer-related donations include printers, mon-
itors, keyboards and mice, operating systems and applications (with 
valid registration codes), and USB memory devices.
 
✓ Cellphones: Several organizations gladly accept unwanted cellphones so 
victims of domestic abuse, the elderly, or other persons in need can call 
911 at no charge. Cellphones can also be reset to provide free or limited 
service for those in need, or sold to raise funds for not-for-profit groups, 
charities, or causes.
 
✓ Digital cameras and camcorders: Various organizations accept digital 
camera and camcorder donations to provide schools, groups, and clubs 
the tools that give those in need the opportunity to explore creative 
photography and filmmaking.
 
✓ Entertainment equipment: TVs, DVD players, even VHS players can 
be useful to schools and other organizations where learning is the first 
order of business.
The following organizations are difficult to categorize by product type 
because many of them accept all kinds of high-tech stuff, including comput-
ers, printers, cellphones, and accessories.
Reading more about each can help you gain greater familiarity with which 
may offer the best fit to receive your gadget generosity:
 
✓ Call to Protect: This national philanthropic program is aimed at combat-
ing domestic violence. All donated phones are sent to the group’s part-
ner, ReCellular, where they’re either refurbished and sold, or recycled. 
One hundred percent of the net proceeds generated by the sale of the 
refurbished phones are used for grants to national organizations work-
ing to end family violence. All phones donated that are obsolete or dam-
aged are recycled according to strict environmental standards. The site 
links to ReCellular’s Free Data Eraser, which provides instructions for 
securely erasing many cellphones before getting rid of them. Visit www.
wirelessfoundation.org/calltoprotect.
 
✓ Cell Phone Trade-Ins: This site lets you dispose of your cellphone and 
help those in need, or just pad your wallet a little bit with cash. The 
service also welcomes iPod trade-ins. Either way, check the site to see 
whether your phone or iPod model is one they want. If so, you can print 
a prepaid label to mail your unwanted gadget to Cell Phone Trade-Ins, 
and soon thereafter, you’ll get a check in the mail if you opted for cash. 
Go to http://cellphonetradeins.com.
 
✓ Collective Good: This mobile devices recycling service makes a dona-
tion on your behalf in exchange for your unwanted cellphone, pager, or 
PDA. Charity choices include The United Way, The Red Cross, Friends of 
the Congo, and several others. Go to www.collectivegood.com.

242
Part V: Ridding Yourself of Gadgets the Green Way 
 
✓ Computers for Schools: Computers for Schools (www.pcsforschools.
org) provides a low cost alternative for achieving technology in the 
classroom, and welcomes contribution of quality computer equipment 
and support dollars from donors across the nation to accomplish their 
refurbishing work.
 
✓ eBay Rethink: The eBay Rethink Initiative (http://pages.ebay.com/
rethink) brings together industry, government, and environmental 
organizations to offer ways to donate, sell, reuse, and recycle unwanted 
gadgets and gear. Donations through eBay Giving Works allow you to 
donate part or the entire final sale price to the nonprofit of your choice. 
I talk about selling your unwanted digital stuff on eBay later in this 
chapter.
 
✓ Freecycle Network: Freecycle Network (www.freecycle.org) is a 
grassroots nonprofit movement of people who are giving (and getting) 
stuff — including electronics — for free in their own towns. It’s all about 
reusing and keeping good stuff out of landfills. Local groups are moder-
ated by a local volunteer group — or what Freecycle refers to as “them’s 
good people.” Membership is free.
 
✓ Goodwill: Encourages businesses and individuals to donate their new 
and used computers. Typing your address into the Goodwill locator 
(www.goodwill.org) can point you to the nearest drop-off site for 
your unwanted computer and peripherals. Just like yours truly, Goodwill 
recommends you securely erase your personal information from your 
unwanted computer’s hard drive, the basics of which I cover at the end 
of this chapter, and more fully in the next chapter.
 
✓ National Cristina Foundation: A not-for-profit foundation dedicated to 
the support of training through donated technology. The foundation 
matches donated computers and other technology products with chari-
ties, schools, and public agencies in all 50 states, Canada, and in many 
countries around the world. Check it out at www.cristina.org.
 
✓ Plug-In To eCycling: A partnership between the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) and consumer electronics manufacturers, 
retailers, and service providers, Plug-In To eCycling (http://epa.
gov/epawaste/partnerships/plugin/index.htm) offers you more 
opportunities to donate or recycle — eCycle — your used electronics. 
The site offers links to numerous partners, including the major mobile 
phone carriers AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, and Verizon (whose HopeLine 
program provides wireless phones to victims of domestic violence).
 
✓ Recycles.org: A service project aimed at area businesses, residents, 
schools, and nonprofit organizations interested in recycling and reus-
ing computers. The organization’s Web site serves as a regional and 
nationwide exchange board directly connecting your unwanted comput-
ers with nonprofit organizations in need. You fill out a form describing 
what you want to get rid of and then respond to requests that come in to 
choose where your unwanted stuff winds up.

243
 Chapter 14: Donating, Gifting, and Selling Unwanted Gadgets
 
✓ ReUseIt Network: The ReUseIt Network (http://reuseitnetwork.
org) is an online forum for connecting local community members who 
are getting rid of items they no longer want with those who can use 
castoff electronics — and most anything else you can think of (except 
drugs), such as sofas, bikes, and even horse manure. The site organizes 
groups by state.
 
✓ TechSoup: This computer and software technology philanthropy ser-
vice for nonprofits is the exclusive U.S. distributor of Microsoft product 
donations. TechSoup (http://techsoup.org) helps connect nonprof-
its and libraries to over 240 products from 25 donating partners. The 
site can help you find a refurbisher who will ensure that equipment they 
send to nonprofits and schools works and runs legal copies of software.
 
 Finding the TechSoup refurbisher section is a bit confusing; here’s how 
to get there:

every day than any other online authorized dealer. So it’s only fitting 
its dot.org site offers a trio of options for getting rid of your unwanted

Trading In or Selling Gadgets 
for Greenbacks
Trading in your unwanted gadgets and gear can reward you with cash or 
credit to apply toward the purchase of something new. Most trade-in pro-
grams expect your unwanted gadget to be in good condition, though some 
will take back damaged goods, such as a working iPhone or Palm smartphone 
with a cracked screen that otherwise operates as it should.
In this section, I offer you some general information about dealing with trade-
in sites and how the process works. I also list several manufacturers and 
dedicated trade-in companies so that you can find one that fits your needs.

Most of the trade-in Web sites promise to securely wipe out your computer’s 
hard drive; however, doing the job yourself can give you a greater sense of 
security that your personal identity information is truly gone for good. To 
learn more about disk wiping, check out Chapter 15.
The basics of the trade-in process
How much can you get back in cash or credit? More than you might imagine. 
Visiting many of the trade-in Web sites I tell you about in a minute, I was 
pretty floored to find out many of the products I plugged into the quote cal-
culators yielded cash or credit values in the hundreds of dollars.
Before you take the plunge into the trading game, keep these points in mind:
 
✓ Big-ticket items: Trading in big-ticket items such as TVs isn’t a common 
practice — however, the trade-in Web sites EcoNEW and VenJuvo do 
accept HDTVs. Both are included in my list of trade-in Web sites, later in 
this chapter.
 
✓ Set-up fees: Most retailers will take away your old TV at no cost to you 
when you buy a new HDTV. Others might charge you a setup fee to 
deliver, turn on, and connect your other entertainment gear to your new 
big screen before hauling off the old one. Ask about any such fees before 
sealing the deal.
 
✓ Recycling: Trade-in Web sites typically promise to responsibly recycle 
gadgets or other electronics they deem hopelessly useless — which 
means your e-waste won’t wind up in a toxic dump overseas. Before 
spending your hard-earned green, however, check with your retailer to 
find out whether they recycle items they take back.
 
✓ Mix-and-match trades: Many computer manufacturers offer trade-in 
programs that include taking back products from other makers in 
exchange for cash or credit toward the purchase of a new computer 
or peripheral — how convenient.
Trade-in programs that offer cash or credit for your unwanted digital stuff 
vary in what they take back. Here’s a rundown of the products you can send 
to trade-in programs:
Desktop and notebook computers
Camcorders
mobile phones
Multimedia projectors
iPods and MP3 players
Home audio receivers
PDAs and handheld computers
Car audio receivers

 Chapter 14: Donating, Gifting, and Selling Unwanted Gadgets
Video game consoles
Computer servers
GPS navigation devices
HD-DVD players
Cameras (digital and nondigital)
The process of trading in your unwanted gadgets and gear typically goes 
something like this:
 
1. Visit the trade-in service’s or reseller’s Web site to see whether they 
take back what you want to get rid of.
 
 Some take back many different things, others just specific products, 
such as cellphones or iPods.
 
2. Click drop-down menus to select your product and specifics.
 
 Information you can provide includes the model, how much memory it 
has, and what condition it’s in.
 
3. Generate a quote based on what you enter in Step 2 to find out the 
estimated value of what you’re getting rid of.

4. If the price sounds right to you, register with the trade-in Web site.
 
 Registering generates a shipping label (sometimes prepaid, sometimes 
not) for sending in your stuff and generally wraps up by having you 
choose whether you want cash or credit.
 
5. Wait for your check or credit to come through, then spend or apply 
toward new purchase.
Finding a trade-in site for you
Some trade-in programs are run by the computer manufacturers, although 
several of the computer companies partner with branded versions of 
DealTree’s EZTradein.com trade-in Web site (see Figure 14-3). EZTradein.com 
also takes back a heck of a lot of other electronics stuff, as you’ll soon see.
Trading in your old computer and peripherals is an option offered by these 
computer manufacturers:
 
✓ Apple: www.apple.com/environment/recycling; for education and 
business customers
 
✓ Dell: http://dell.eztradein.com
 
✓ Gateway: http://gateway.eztradein.com
 
✓ HP: www.hp.com/united-states/tradein
 
✓ IBM: www-935.ibm.com/services/us/index.wss/offerfamily/

✓ Sony: http://sony.tradeups.com
 
✓ Toshiba: http://toshiba.eztradein.com
The Sony trade-up program, shown in Figure 14-4, also takes back PDAs, 
smartphones, camcorders, and digital cameras.
Trade-in Web sites that give you cash or credit in exchange for your 
unwanted electronics include the following:
 
✓ EZTradein.com: Welcomes trade-ins from the preceding list, and pays 
you seven days after receipt of your unwanted gadgets and other elec-
tronics. EZTradein partners with a number of computer manufacturers, 
as well as Best Buy, TigerDirect.com, Buy.com, and other consumer elec-
tronics makers and retailers.
 
✓ Sony: Accepts copiers, desktops, notebooks, tablet PCs, large flat panel 
displays, monitors, PDAs, smartphones, printers, professional audio, 
cameras, camcorders, storage devices, switches, and projectors. Visit

✓ Gazelle: Gazelle (www.gazelle.com) lets you trade in most of the 
typical stuff — computers, iPods, digital cameras — and also video 
games and Blu-ray movies. Unlike most other trade-in programs, Gazelle 
thoughtfully provides a prepaid mailing box to ship your stuff. As of 
this writing, the site reports an average payment to customers is $115. 
Gazelle sends payment by way of PayPal, check, or Amazon.com gift 
card.
 
✓ GameStop: Find the store nearest you to drop by and trade in video 
game consoles, games, and accessories for store credits or cash. Opting 
for credit earns you more — and you can use the credit either in-store 
or on the GameStop Web site (www.gamestop.com).
 
✓ Consumer Electronics Recycling: Accepts trade-ins of working or 
broken cellphones, smartphones, PDAs, iPods, and Zune media play-
ers, and assuming that your gadget is in the condition you said it was, 
the company sends your check in as little as one or two business days. 
That’s fast money! Visit www.cerecycle.com.
 
✓ Small Dog Electronics: Trading in your unwanted Mac or iPod earns you 
credit toward the purchase of any new product or products from Small 
Dog Electronics (www.smalldog.com/tradein).
 
✓ MyBoneYard: MyBoneYard (myboneyard.com) is one of the few trade-
in Web sites to take smaller size flat panel displays. You can also trade 
in desktops, notebook computers, and a variety of laptops and moni-
tors, but MyBoneYard doesn’t accept models from IBM, Dell, and Sony. 
Additionally, it accepts smaller-sized plasma TVs. MyBoneYard appears 
to be the least lucrative; receiving payment — in the form of a prepaid 
Visa credit card — can take three to ten weeks. 
 
✓ EcoNEW: Choosing a gift card from three partners — Sam’s Club, Office 
Depot, or Navy Exchange stores (for our men and women in the armed 
services) — is your only way to get paid for your unwanted computers, 
camcorders, and other gadgets. EcoNEW (http://econewonline.
com) also accepts LCD HDTV trade-ins, which is uncommon in the trade-
in biz.
 
✓ FlipSwap: Trade in your iPod or cellphone for in-store credit or a check 
sent to you or a charity of your choosing if you prefer. Or type your zip 
code to locate a nearby FlipSwap partner retail store to walk in with 
your trade in and walk out with a little more green in your wallet. Visit 
www.flipswap.com.
 
✓ NextWorth: Specializing in iPod and iPhone trade-ins only, NextWorth 
(http://nextworth.com) partners with Amazon (giving you gift card 
credits for your unwanted player or phone) and with J&R electronics 
(www.jr.com) for online or instant in-store credit if you happen to be in 
Manhattan and opt to drop by.

249
 Chapter 14: Donating, Gifting, and Selling Unwanted Gadgets
 
✓ BuyMyTronics: Trade in your iPod, cellphone, PDA, video game 
machine, laptop, digital camera, or camcorder and get a check in the 
mail a few days after BuyMyTronics (http://buymytronics.com) 
verifies that what you sent is as you described. Opting for electronic 
funds transfer by way of PayPal instead of the mail makes your exchange 
of unwanted gadget for e-cash all the more green.
 
One unusual trade-in service is www.techforward.com, which requires you 
to purchase what’s called a Guaranteed Buyback plan when you purchase a 
new computer or other electronic device. With the Buyback plan, you know 
exactly what TechForward will pay you when you get rid of your gadget or PC 
in as little as six months, to as long as two years, from the time of initial 
purchase.
Selling Your Old Electronics on Craigslist
Selling your unwanted gadget or other electronic device by listing it in your 
local paper or on an online listing site, such as Craigslist (www.craigslist.
org), isn’t much different from selling anything — be it a couch, article of 
clothing, or vintage GI Joe with Life-Like hair (eh hem).
These tips will help you get started:
 
✓ Do comparative pricing: Check your local paper to see whether others 
are selling items like the gadgets you want to get rid of, and then price 
accordingly.
 
✓ Be descriptive: When you list unwanted gadgets, a colorful description 
can grab a potential buyer’s eye better than being too simple or vague. 
For instance, a listing such as “Pretty in Pink Palm Centro for Your 
Valentine” is more attention getting than “Palm Cellphone.”
Signing up to list items for sale on Craigslist, shown in Figure 14-5, is free. 
Craigslist.org is the big umbrella Web site beneath which the service’s hun-
dreds of regional sub-sites live.
Choosing the region closest to you may seem like the obvious thing to do; 
however, if you live close to a city, you might want to choose it instead to 
reach more potential buyers. For instance, say you live in Jersey City and 
take the train into Manhattan every day. Listing your original iPhone you’ve 
replaced with the latest model in the Big Apple not only attracts more poten-
tial buyers, it makes it easier for you to exchange the device with the buyer 
on your lunch break or on your way to or from work.

That strategy worked for me when I listed my original Xbox 360 in Philadelphia 
rather than the tiny Jersey Shore beach town where I live. Because I’m always 
up for the one-hour drive to Philly to hang out with my best friend, I had many 
more responses and offers to buy my Xbox 360 than when I originally tried sell-
ing it closer to home. On the other hand, listing my HDTV locally and finding 
a buyer was no trouble at all because it appealed to a wider potential buying 
audience. See the nearby sidebar, “Selling my HDTV on Craigslist.”
Selling my HDTV on craigslist
Selling my too-big LCD HDTV on craigslist when 
I moved into my tiny new home saved me the 
fees and astronomical shipping cost I would 
have had to charge a buyer if I were to sell it on 
eBay. Even if I sold it locally by way of eBay, I 
would still incur eBay’s fee for the commission 
it takes on a sale in addition to the fee to list the 
item in the first place.
The buyer of my HDTV happened to live just 
a few blocks away, a young woman whose 
parents came along with her to check out the 
set. They were nice people and I knocked $50 
off the price because I can relate to saving 
money at that age (and at my age!).
Sensing I could trust the buyer, I had no qualms 
about giving out my address so they could come 
by and see the set. On the other hand, when I’ve 
sold smaller unwanted gadgets, I’ve asked the 
buyer to meet me in a public place, such as a 
bookstore cafe.

 Chapter 14: Donating, Gifting, and Selling Unwanted Gadgets
Auctioning Unwanted Gadgets on 
eBay and Other Auction Web Sites
Auctioning your unwanted gadgets and other electronic stuff on the big 
daddy auction site of them all — eBay — can reach the world’s largest audi-
ence of potential buyers. (See Figure 14-6.)
 
Figure 14-6: 
eBay is the 
Big Kahuna 
of online 
auctions.
 
Selling my unwanted gadgets and other tech-related stuff on eBay has been a 
mostly positive experience. However, as I explain in the sidebar “How I lost 
$1500 by not playing by the rules,” understanding every eBay rule and policy 
can prevent a similar screw-up from happening to you when you’re selling 
anything for more than a few bucks.
 
The following nuggets of advice can help make selling your unwanted gadgets 
and digital stuff more profitable:
 
✓ Know your competition. Search for the same product you’re selling, and 
pay attention to how high the bids are for the auctions that are ending 
the soonest. Also, select the “Completed Auctions” check box in the left 
column to narrow down the final prices the same gadget sold for. Price 
your gadget a little lower or around the same price that many other sell-
ers landed for the same gadget to increase your likelihood of closing a 
sale.

252
Part V: Ridding Yourself of Gadgets the Green Way 
 
✓ Think twice about Buy It Now and Reserve Prices. Attaching a Reserve 
Price to your unwanted gadget can turn off potential buyers — espe-
cially if you set a high Buy-It-Now price. Deciding whether to use the 
Reserve Price option can spell the difference between turning away bid-
ders and getting lots of potential buyers bidding on your item.
 
✓ Avoid padding your shipping costs. Hiking your shipping charge 
beyond what it costs to ship your unwanted gadget can turn off poten-
tial buyers and limit your chance of making a sale. Offering free Priority 
Mail or other relatively fast but affordable shipping service for smaller 
gadgets can increase your chance of attracting a winning bidder.
 
✓ Choose the proper category. Choosing the most accurate category for 
your item can make the difference between lots of people bidding on it 
versus fewer bids because potential buyers didn’t find it. Selling an iPod 
in the MP3 Players category attracts buyers, but choosing the iPod cat-
egory specifically ensures that the right group of potential buyers sees 
your unwanted iPod.
 
✓ Remember that a picture is worth a thousand words. Posting a clear, 
detailed picture of your gadget and any accessories that come with 
it shows potential buyers your item is for real and in (hopefully) nice 
condition. Skipping a photo or using a stock image limits your chance of 
selling your items.
How I lost $1500 by not playing by the rules
I was new to eBay at the time, and I didn’t know 
not to send an item to an address other than the 
verified one, which would have protected me 
against the fraud I endured. Here’s the story: 
I listed an unwanted notebook computer on 
the site. No one bid on it, but when the auction 
ended, I received an e-mail from a guy offering 
the Buy It Now price of $1200 — and he said 
he would pay up to $300 to cover shipping the 
notebook to South Africa.
I said yes; however, I wouldn’t ship the com-
puter until I had withdrawn the full amount 
from my PayPal account, which allows me to 
withdraw $500 per day with the debit card the 
electronic funds service offers members. Three 
days later, I had the money in hand; it didn’t 
seem like it should matter that the guy asked 
me to ship the computer to what he said was 
his work address, rather than the verified home 
address PayPal listed for the buyer.
I shipped the computer by way of UPS, tracked 
it online, and saw that it arrived about a week 
later. That was the last I thought of it until a few 
months later, when my PayPal account sud-
denly appeared $1500 in the red. The service 
sent me notification that the transaction was 
being investigated, and when I e-mailed the 
buyer, he said it was just an error and I shouldn’t 
worry, it would get cleared up.
The long and short of it: The guy had stolen a 
credit card to pay me, and when the owner 
of the card eventually discovered the illegal 
charge, they notified PayPal, which in turn 
hit me with what’s called a chargeback. The 
moral of the story? Shipping only to a buyer’s 
confirmed address can protect you from losing 
your shirt.

253
 Chapter 14: Donating, Gifting, and Selling Unwanted Gadgets
 
✓ Allow PayPal protection. Allowing potential buyers to pay for your item 
with PayPal can increase your chance of selling your item. Protect your-
self from scam artists by requiring bidders to have a PayPal account 
and ship only to a winner’s confirmed address to help assure potential 
buyers that you’re an honest seller.
 
✓ Build a feedback rating. Successful eBay sellers have one critically 
important thing in common: a positive feedback rating. Build your own 
positive feedback rating by accurately listing your items, communicating 
with bidders and buyers, shipping on time, and leaving accurate 
feedback.
 
✓ Enlist eBay-savvy friends. If auctioning only one or a few gadgets is all 
you have in mind, consider having an eBay savvy friend, family member, 
or trusted coworker with a positive rating sell your unwanted item on 
your behalf, then reward their efforts by allowing them to keep a share 
of the sale price.
 
Getting into the nitty gritty of selling your gadget on eBay is beyond the scope 
of this book — but not beyond the scope of eBay For Dummies, 5th Edition, 
by Marsha Collier (Wiley). Read that book if you’re planning to sell lots of 
unwanted gadgets and other things to become a top-notch selling pro.
The best-known auction Web site, eBay isn’t your only option. Considering 
what makes the other online auction Web sites different from eBay can help 
you choose the one best suited for getting rid of your stuff:
 
✓ Bonanzle: Bonanzle (www.bonanzle.com) refers to itself as an online 
marketplace for buying and selling items faster while having more fun, 
stating its specialty is “helping you buy and sell items that aren’t shiny, 
new, and mass-produced.” Posting items is free, and Bonanzle charges 
low final offer value fees that range from fifty cents for items under $10, 
and $1, $3, and $5 for items under $50, $100, and $1000. Anything more 
than that costs sellers only $10.
 
✓ eBid: Charging no listing fee and a final value fee of only 3 percent to 
basic free members, the growing eBid member base (http://ebid.
net) makes it worth taking a look at. eBid eliminates the final value fee 
for members who pay for Seller+ privileges for as little as $1.99 per week 
to $59.99 per year. At the time of this writing, eBid.net has a lifetime 
Seller+ membership offer for $49.99.
 
✓ PlunderHere: PlunderHere (www.plunderhere.com) says that its goal 
is to become the “go to” marketplace for buyers and sellers. With no fee 
for listing items and a small final value fee from .01 to 2.5 percent, it may 
well be where you go to sell your gadgets. PlunderHere also charges 
small fees for listing options, such as adding video, or for featuring your 
item on the site.

254
Part V: Ridding Yourself of Gadgets the Green Way 
 
✓ Overstock.com Auctions: Overstock.com Auctions (auctions.
overstock.com) states that its listing, upgrading (if applicable), 
reserve price, and end of auction final value fees are 33 to 50 percent 
lower than “our major competition.” Hmm, I wonder who they’re talking 
about? Anyway, fees are based on a percentage of the selling price, and 
the service’s feedback rating system is similar to “The World’s Biggest 
Auction Web Site Whose Name We Shall Not Speak” — which can make 
for more reliable buyers.
 
✓ Wigix: Wigix (www.wigix.com) calls itself a “socially-driven market-
place,” where you can communicate with others to negotiate prices. 
Unlike eBay, Wigix doesn’t charge you to list an item. And making money 
without selling anything by perfecting item descriptions in Wigix’s cata-
log can earn you a slice of the revenue pie. Selling a gadget for under $25 
is free, and Wigix takes a commission of only $1.50 from both buyer and 
seller for items sold up to $100. Wigix takes an additional 2 or 3 percent 
commission for items selling over $1000.

n Chapter 14, I explain how donating, or “gifting,” your unwanted com-
puter or mobile phone is a greener action than tossing the device in the 
trash. Maybe you prefer to make some extra bucks by selling items rather 
than giving them away. Either way, hooray! The planet thanks you — and so 
will the lucky recipient or organization on the receiving end of your act of 
kindness if you’re giving without taking cash in return.
Before waving bye-bye to an old notebook computer or digital camera, you 
can protect your identity from possible theft by potentially unscrupulous 
buyers or benefactors. To protect your identity, you can erase the many bits 
of personal data stored on built-in memory devices, memory cards, and hard 
drives.
This chapter explains how to wipe out personal identity information from 
gadgets you’re tossing so that your bank account or other aspects of your 
personal privacy aren’t wiped out or exposed.

256
Part V: Ridding Yourself of Gadgets the Green Way 
Deleting Your Personal Stuff — The 
Short Way and the Long Way
Wiping personal information is easier on some devices than on others. 
Gadgets without hard drives — such as mobile phones and smartphones and 
personal digital assistants (PDAs) — are typically easy to wipe clean. You 
might think that eliminating personal information from an unwanted com-
puter should involve only the task of dragging files and folders to the Recycle 
Bin or Trash, and then emptying those receptacles. So long, and thanks for all 
the memories, right? Not so. 
 
Although documents and other files tossed into the Recycle Bin or Trash 
appear to vanish after it’s emptied, some or most of the information stays on 
the hard drive. It’s stored in a hidden format that seems inaccessible to us 
mere mortals but is in reality easy pickings for hackers, tech-savvy types, and 
nosy, entry-level service technicians.
 
Choosing a disk wiping option is the most thorough way to securely erase the 
hard drive on your soon-to-be-discarded computer. Unlike the basic format-
ting process, disk wiping overwrites the drive with gobbledygook, a process 
that techies refer to as zeroing.
The trade-off to wiping the disk is that completing the job can take many 
hours or an entire day or more, depending on the level of security you 
choose. That’s because the drive is wiped many times in a row. The larger 
the number of wipes, the stronger the guarantee that even the faintest recol-
lection of you is truly a thing of the past.
 
For a more thorough take on the ins and outs of disk wiping, check out the 
Apple description of how the Mac’s Disk Utility, shown in Figure 15-1, 
gets the cleanup job done, at http://support.apple.com/kb/
TA24002?viewlocale=en_US. The Disk Utility options are few, but many 
are the hours you wait after choosing the more secure 7-Pass or 35-Pass Erase 
options.
 
When you dig into a gadget’s settings, you often find an option to erase and 
reset the gizmo, as shown in Figure 15-2. For example, after you press the 
Erase All Content and Settings button on the iPhone and it restarts, it has no 
recollection that you ever existed.

Part V: Ridding Yourself of Gadgets the Green Way 
On some cell phones or PDAs, erasing personal data and settings is often 
accomplished by tapping a few keys or holding down a button or three while 
powering on the gadget. Voilà! The gadget then has straight-from-the-factory 
freshness and is ready to start a new personally rewarding relationship with 
a fresh face (and fingertips) — just like it was when you turned on the gadget 
for the first time.
 
Saying “sayonara” to gadgets and computers that have built-in or attached 
hard drives requires that you give them special consideration and take certain 
steps to ensure that the recipient doesn’t also wind up scoring your personal 
or sensitive information in exchange.
Determining how to prepare a computer before disposing of it comes down 
to one thing: trust.
Considering Trust to Decide How 
to Erase Personal Information
Giving an unwanted computer to a trusted family member or friend who 
isn’t likely to install a snooping utility to scan the hard drive for previously 
deleted information is generally assurance enough for most people that past 
memories once living on the computer will remain so forever.
 
If you donate or sell a computer to a stranger or someone not quite close 
enough to you to call a friend or trusted acquaintance, you have to decide 
which approach to take before turning over the goods: quick and relatively 
easy or complex and time consuming.
To know you is to trust you
Preparing a computer before giving it away to someone you trust requires a 
few steps before you’re ready to give it away:
 
1. Back up files and media that you want to keep.
 
2. Reclaim rights to the programs and media you want to keep (see the 
later section “Deauthorizing Computer Programs before Giving Away 
Your PC”).
 
3. Create a new user account for the soon-to-be owner (for this step and 
Step 4, see “Deleting Your User Account Files without Reformatting the 
Hard Drive,” later in this chapter).
 
4. Delete your user account.

259
 Chapter 15: Erasing Your Personal Information before Getting Rid of Gadgets
 
5. Run optional disk cleanup programs for additional security (see 
“Completely Erasing Deleted Files and Hard Drives,” at the end of this 
chapter).
I want to trust you, but I’m just not sure
Restoring a computer by using the factory restore discs generally supplied 
with most computers is the easiest way to wipe out and restore the hard 
drive to factory freshness. Performing a factory restore requires these steps:
 
1. Back up the files and media that you want to keep.
 
2. Reclaim rights to the programs and media you want to keep (see 
“Deauthorizing Computer Programs before Giving Away Your PC,” later 
in this chapter).
 
3. Restart the computer with its factory restore discs (see “Restoring 
Computers to Factory-Fresh Condition,” later in this chapter).
 
4. Choose the Reformat option, if it’s available, and run the restore process.
 
5. (Optional) Install drivers and bundled programs.
 
6. (Optional) Run system updates.
 
7. (Optional) Reinstall and update additional programs.
 
Depending on how much time you’re willing to invest in your giveaway, you might 
want to reinstall any programs that were added after you originally purchased or 
acquired the computer. Ditto for however many tens or possibly hundreds of 
hardware drivers and operating system and third-party program updates, 
upgrades, and patches you downloaded to keep all your programs up-to-date.
Finders keepers
How risky is selling or giving away a computer 
without first wiping the hard drive of private 
information? Very, according to a 2003 study 
conducted by two MIT graduate students.
Sifting through data left on 158 hard drives, 
the students uncovered more than 5,000 credit 
card numbers as well as financial and medical 
records, personal e-mail messages, and digital

One hard drive purportedly contained a year’s 
worth of banking transaction information — 
from the automatic teller machine it previously 
served before the students got their hands on 
the drive.
The students said around 60 percent of the drives 
had been formatted but not securely wiped, 
which enabled the students to recover files 
deleted from the drive’s previous owners’ docu-
ments folder with a simple disk recovery utility.

On the other hand, you might decide to restore the computer’s hard drive 
to minimal factory freshness and leave to the new owner the task of all that 
extra reinstalling and updating.
Deauthorizing Computer Programs 
before Giving Away Your PC
Before you get rid of a computer, you have to deactivate or deauthorize pro-
grams that require a password or a registration code to use or enable them 
to open files or media. Apple iTunes, for example, lets you play purchased 
music on as many as five computers, and it’s your job to keep track of which 
computers you authorized to play the music you paid for.
 
Wiping out a hard drive before deauthorizing iTunes means saying goodbye to 
one of those keys to your purchased music kingdom. (See the following side-
bar, “Deauthorizing iTunes,” for more details.)
 
Sometimes, authorizing and deauthorizing go by different names — including 
activating and deactivating, authenticating and deauthenticating, and locking 
and unlocking. Whatever you call the process (see Figure 15-3), the purpose is 
always the same: To give you the right to manage usage rights to products or 
media that are rightly yours.
Zapping cellphones and smartphones in seconds
If the gadget you’re giving away is a mobile 
phone, smartphone, or MP3 player that has no 
built-in hard drive, erasing your past is a cinch.
Restoring most mobile phones to factory fresh-
ness generally requires keying in a series of 
symbols and numbers and then pressing the 
Call button to carry out the wipeout.
On the other hand, you zap a Palm smartphone 
and PDA by holding down a button while 
powering on the device. On some devices, 
choosing an option from the device’s Settings 
menu erases and restores the gadget to factory 
freshness.
Check the manual’s index for the word resetting 
or restoring or erasing, or search the Web for 
your particular device and the phrase factory 
restore or factory reset.

Many programs — such as Microsoft Office, for instance — use a similar per-
computer or per-device protection scheme, so be sure to deactivate or, in 
the case of Office, uninstall those programs before getting rid of desktop and 
notebook computers.. This way you’ll be able to reinstall programs you’ve 
deactivated on your new computer using the program’s installation disc (or 
in many cases, downloading the latest version), and then activating with the 
registration code you received when you originally purchased the program.
Like their bigger-box cousins, running programs on gadgets sometimes 
require you to authorize them, as shown in Figure 15-4, and in some cases, 
deauthorize them if you intend to download and use them on a different 
device.
 
Making a list of the programs that require deactivation or deuthorization can 
prevent potential headaches (and spending) in the future.
Print, or e-mail yourself, a copy of any receipts containing activation codes 
you may need the next time you install or use the programs.

Deauthorizing iTunes
I cite Apple iTunes in this sidebar to demon-
strate how to deauthorize a program on your 
computer. Why iTunes? Because it’s the world’s 
most popular program for buying music online, 
chances are good that you’re using it too! And 
I’m guessing that you, like me, would rather not 
accidentally give up the right to play music or 
videos you purchased for your own listening 
and viewing pleasure.
You can use your iTunes account and media 
you’ve purchased (movies, TV programs, music) 
on up to five computers. Apple lets you deautho-
rize all five computers once per year if you’ve 
authorized all five uses but aren’t access-
ing iTunes on five computers. The option isn’t 
available unless all five uses are active, and it 
doesn’t appear if you used the option already 
but have yet to pass the one-year mark.
To deauthorize iTunes on a Mac or Windows 
computer, follow these steps:
 1. Open iTunes.
 2. Choose Store➪Deauthorize Computer.
 3. Select Deauthorize Computer for Apple 
Account and enter your Apple ID and pass-
word.
 
 If you see the alert (shown in the figure), 
you know you have successfully deautho-
rized iTunes.
Warning: Deauthorize iTunes on your computer 
before upgrading RAM, adding a new, built-in 
hard disk or another system component, or 
reinstalling Windows. Changes such as these 
can cause iTunes to treat your upgraded com-
puter differently from the one you originally 
authorized, so be sure to deauthorize to avoid 
the potential need to use a second usage slot 
on the same — albeit somewhat different — 
system.
To deauthorize every computer all at once and 
reset the usage count to zero:
 1. Open iTunes.
 2. Click iTunes Store in the left column.
 3. Click your account name in the upper-right 
corner.
 
 If the button is labeled Sign In, click it and 
sign in to your iTunes account, and then 
click the Account button again to display 
your account information.
 4. Enter your password.
 5. Click the Deauthorize All button.
 6. Click Deauthorize All Computers button.
Note: You don’t see the Deauthorize All button 
if you authorized fewer than five computers or 
if you already used the option within the past 
12 months.

Deleting Your User Account Files 
before Getting Rid of a Computer
The steps necessary to delete your personal user account files and informa-
tion before giving a computer to someone you trust varies between Macs and 
Windows PCs.
 
As I explain at the beginning of this chapter (see “Deleting Your Personal 
Stuff — the Short Way and the Long Way”), deleting your user account files — 
items such as documents, photos, videos, and music — makes them appear to 
disappear from the hard disk.
 
You can recover some or most of the files by using a disk recovery utility such 
as Active@ UNDELETE, shown in Figure 15-5. Running a disk wiping utility 
erases all traces of your deleted user account files but doesn’t erase the com-
puter’s operating system or programs. (See the section “Completely Erasing 
Deleted Files and Hard Drives,” at the end of this chapter.)

Restoring Computers to 
Factory-Fresh Condition
Factory freshness means that no personal data is on the gadget or computer, 
and all its custom settings are reset to the defaults that the manufacturer 
chose at the factory. Restoring a Mac or Windows computer is relatively 
quick and easy — as long as you’re still in possession of the operating system 
recovery discs.
 
The steps for restoring Macs and Windows computers to factory freshness are 
generally alike, and they go something like this:
 
1. Insert the original system recovery (or separately purchased Mac OS X 
or Windows XP or Vista operating system) installation disc in the CD or 
DVD drive and power on or reboot the computer
 
2. Hold down the C key on the Mac keyboard to start from the disc rather 
than the hard disk; in Windows, you press any key when prompted 
about booting from the disc.
 
3. Choose the option to erase the hard disk quickly (and insecurely) or 
slowly (more secure) before restoring the operating system and bundled 
applications.
 
4. Pour a favorite beverage and read a book or go for a long walk, and 
return an hour or so later to a newly restored computer that has no 
recollection of you and is more than happy to take up with a new owner, 
thank you very much.
 
5. Hand over the computer to its new owner — and don’t forget to include 
the recovery discs so that the new person can perform the same amne-
siac wipeout in the future!
Only the quick-and-dirty versus slow-and-secure formatting choices need 
additional explanation, so choose your system, grab those system discs, and 
let’s rock and recover!
Formatting and restoring a 
Windows hard drive
You restore a Windows Vista or XP PC to factory freshness as described in 
the preceding set of steps. However, which formatting options you choose 
from depends on the make and model of the computer you’re preparing to 
give away and on its recovery discs.

274
Part V: Ridding Yourself of Gadgets the Green Way 
Some computers are shipped with several discs for restoring not only the 
Windows operating system but also additional programs that come bundled 
as part of the package. Some computers require you to burn your own set of 
recovery discs with a bundled disc burning utility, as shown in Figure 15-12.
 
Figure 15-12: 
Restoring 
factory 
freshness 
with discs 
you burn.
 
 
Because the steps to recover a Windows Vista or XP PC with the bundled fac-
tory restore discs vary by make and model, you might need to poke around to 
find options for how the hard drive is formatted before installing the operating 
system.
Alternatively, you can skip the manufacturer’s recovery discs entirely and 
restore the computer by using the Windows Vista or XP installation CD. It 
either came with the computer or you purchased it later on.
Choosing the Windows-only method guarantees that you have the option of 
selecting the longer, full-formatting option.
 
If your factory restore discs don’t offer a secure formatting option, you can 
first perform the first steps of a Windows-only restore, followed by the factory 
restore process. Why the double take? The first pass lets you choose the 
longer and more secure method of wiping out the hard disk before installing 
Windows — which you’ll skip because you use the factory restore discs to do 
that job.
Windows XP
Boot the Windows XP installation disc and format your hard drive by follow-
ing these steps:
 
1. Insert the Windows XP disc into the CD drive and then restart your 
computer.
 
 If your version of Windows XP came with a floppy disk, insert it into the 
floppy drive and then restart your computer, and when prompted, insert 
the CD and press Enter.

8. When the disk wiping is done, choose Disk Utility➪Quit Disk Utility.
 
 The Disk Utility returns you to the Mac OS X Installer Welcome screen. 
 
9. Click Continue on the Welcome screen, and then follow the prompts 
to restore the Mac’s OS X operating system and applications.
Completely Erasing Deleted 
Files and Hard Drives
Deleting files removes them from being seen, but some or most of the files 
remain on the hard drive in a hidden format — even if you empty your 
Recycle Bin or Trash. Although mere mortals can’t easily recover the hidden 
files, hackers, tech-savvy types, and nosy entry-level service technicians can.
 
If you have a hopelessly useless computer that you’re sending to a recycler 
rather than to a new user, it’s extremely important that you wipe the hard 
drive. Doing so prevents anyone who’s handling the computer on its way to 
the grave from potentially recovering your personal files or information from 
the drive.
 
Disk wiping utilities remove all traces of hidden files left behind on a drive’s free 
space after deleting your user account — or an entire hard drive before running 
one of the computer recovery methods described earlier in this chapter.
Wiping Mac hard drives is easy, thanks to the Disk Utility program included 
with every Mac.
Although Microsoft doesn’t include a disk wiping program in Windows, you 
can find several that are free to download.
Wiping Windows hard drives
To wipe your Windows computer’s hard drive before restoring it to factory 
freshness, see the earlier section “Formatting and restoring a Windows hard 
drive.” 
 
If you can’t find the Windows XP or Windows Vista installation disc to wipe 
out the hard drive on a computer you’re sending to a recycler, worry not — all 
is not lost. Running one of the free disk wiping utilities in the following list can 
wipe your hard drive clean before you dispose of it.

You don’t have to completely reformat your hard drive and reinstall every-
thing before you give it away; you can just wipe the free space on it after you 
create a new user account and then delete yours. That way, the new owner 
gets a like-new experience — with OS and all the programs still on the com-
puter — but no traces (not even hidden ones) of your personal files, which 
you’ve deleted. You can do so by using one of these free utilities:
 
✓ Darik’s Boot And Nuke (DBAN): Creates a bootable floppy, CD, or USB 
storage device to start up your computer and wipe built-in or attached 
hard drives. See www.dban.org.
 
✓ CMRR Secure Erase: Available at cmrr.ucsd.edu/people/Hughes/
SecureErase.shtml and has the same function as DBAN (see preced-
ing bullet).
 
✓ No File Recovery: Wipes free space without erasing the Windows oper-
ating system, programs, and other files you want to keep on the hard 
drive. See www.softdd.com/no-file-recovery.
 
✓ Active@ Kill Disk: Similar to No File Recovery (see preceding bullet), 
with the option to create a bootable floppy, CD, or USB storage device to 
start up your computer to wipe free space or the entire drive. The free 
version offers only a single-pass wipe. See www.killdisk.com.
 
✓ Eraser: Similar to the programs in the preceding two bullets and avail-
able at www.heidi.ie/node/6a.
 
All the disk wiping utilities in the preceding list offer multiple levels of disk 
wiping thoroughness, from relatively fast and fairly secure to slow as molasses 
and safe from even the CIA’s savviest tech wizard.
Wiping Mac hard drives
To completely wipe your Mac’s hard drive before restoring the computer to 
factory freshness, see “Formatting and restoring a Mac hard drive,” a little 
earlier in this chapter.
 
You might, instead of restoring your Mac to factory freshness, have deleted 
your user account files and created instead a new account for the intended 
recipient of your Mac (see “Deleting Your User Account Files before Getting 
Rid of a Computer,” earlier in this chapter). If so, you can run Disk Utility to 
ensure that deleted files are securely erased without wiping out the operating 
system and installed applications.

281
 Chapter 15: Erasing Your Personal Information before Getting Rid of Gadgets
To securely wipe deleted files from your Mac’s hard disk, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Desktop to switch to the Finder; then press Command+Shift+U 
to open your Mac’s Utilities folder.
 
 Note: You find the Utilities folder in your Mac’s Application folder, in 
case you prefer to navigate to it with your mouse.
 
2. Double-click the Disk Utility icon to launch it.
 
 The main Disk Utility screen appears and displays your Mac’s built-in 
hard disk and any other disks in the left column.
 
3. Click the disk labeled Macintosh HD (or whatever you may have 
renamed your Mac’s main startup hard disk), and then click the 
Erase tab.
 
 Disk Utility hard disk erase options appear.
 
4. Click the Erase Free Space button.
 
 The Erase Free Space Options box appears.
 
 The Zero Out Data option is the fastest way to wipe your Mac’s hard 
disk, but it’s not as thorough or secure as either the 7-Pass Erase or 
35-Pass Erase option, which can take several hours to more than a day 
to complete.
 
5. Click the Erase Free Space button in the lower-right corner; then click 
the Erase button to acknowledge the warning and begin the disk 
wiping process
 
6. When the disk wiping is done, choose Disk Utility➪Quit Disk Utility.

Recycling and Properly Disposing 
of Hopelessly Useless Gadgets
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding e-waste and e-cycling
▶ Finding reputable e-cyclers — locally and long distance
▶ Erasing personal information before disposing of gadgets and computers
▶ Deciding whether to break down gadgets and computers or leave them whole
I
n Chapter 14, I talk about how it’s greener to donate, gift, or sell your 
unwanted cellphone or computer instead of tossing it in the trash. But 
even when your intentions are good, some out-of-service electronics — such 
as that decades-old PC clone in the garage that ran on floppy disks — are so 
out-of-date they’re more hindrance than help.
Ditto for that reasonably modern smartphone that slipped from your hand 
and blew apart in four directions when it hit the pavement. Either way, opting 
to recycle — or e-cycle — hopelessly useless or expired electronic stuff — or 
e-waste — is still the smarter, greener choice over dumping dead electron-
ics in the garbage. Chapter 1 discusses why burying dead gadgets and other 
electronic devices has a hazardous effect on not only local environments and 
the people living in them but also on the planet and worldwide population.
As the saying goes, “One man’s trash is another man’s treasure,” especially 
when the trash we’re picking over is of the electronic variety. Although a fried 
PC’s number-crunching days may be long over, a number of recyclable ele-
ments retrieved from its insides — such as gold, copper, and aluminum — may 
have already found new life inside that spanking new notebook computer 
propped open on your seatback tray table.

284
Part V: Ridding Yourself of Gadgets the Green Way 
If you’re reading this chapter, you’ve come to the last option in the reduce-
reuse-recycle mantra for being green. In the following pages, I explain how to 
securely erase personal information from gadgets or computers and help you 
decide whether they should be left whole or separated into parts before ship-
ping or dropping off to one or more environmentally responsible recyclers or 
corporate e-cycling programs.
Understanding E-Waste and E-Cycling
E-waste refers to an electronic device or gadget that has these characteristics:
 
✓ It has reached the end of its lifecycle.
 
✓ It’s broken beyond repair.
 
✓ It’s still working but isn’t worth upgrading, selling, or giving away.
E-cycling is the process of properly disposing of e-waste.
E-waste from around the world that isn’t e-cycled often winds up in China, 
where it’s cheaper to dump than properly dispose of.
The environmental organization Greenpeace estimates that 20 to 50 mil-
lion tonnes (metric tons) of electronics are discarded every year — enough 
e-waste to fill a train of containers to encircle the entire planet!
Computers and gadgets have hundreds to thousands of components, many 
of which contain toxins such as lead and mercury, and hazardous chemicals 
such as brominated flame retardants.
Some researchers estimate up to 75 percent of unwanted electronic devices 
and gadgets are in storage because many people are uncertain how to prop-
erly dispose of their unwanted e-waste.

285
 Chapter 16: Recycling and Properly Disposing of Hopelessly Useless Gadgets
Fortunately, public awareness of e-waste and e-cycling is on the rise, as more 
states, cities, communities, and individuals do the right thing when it comes 
to collecting and properly processing and disposing of discarded electronics. 
Here are just two examples:
 
✓ California defines unwanted televisions and monitors as hazardous 
materials; dumping them in the trash is against the law.
 
✓ As of July 1, 2009, New York City’s Electronic Equipment Collection, 
Recycling and Reuse Act permits New Yorkers to return used electronics 
to the manufacturer for recycling. In summer of 2010, tossing e-waste in 
the trash will be illegal for New Yorkers.
An e-waste recipe for disaster
Environmental watchdog organization 
Greenpeace (www.greenpeace.org/
electronics) cites the following elements 
and factors as the most common and harmful 
ingredients in the world’s hazardous e-waste 
recipe for disaster:
 ✓ Brominated flame retardants (BRFs): Used 
in circuit boards and plastic casings, some 
BFRs don’t break down easily and wind up 
building up in the environment. Learning dis-
orders, memory impairment, impact on the 
thyroid and estrogen hormone systems, and 
resultant behavior problems after exposure 
in the womb are cited as potential effects 
caused by exposure to BFRs.
 ✓ Tetrabromobisphenol (TBBPA): Another 
brominated flame retardant, it’s linked to 
neurotoxicity. As much as 1000 metric tons 
of TBBPA went into the manufacturing of 
674 million cellphones in 2004.
 ✓ Cathode ray tubes (CRT): Approximately 
10,000 metric tons of lead went into the total 
worldwide sales of CRTs in 2002. Although 
CRTs are increasingly a thing of the past, 
exposure to the lead contained in discarded 
CRTs has been linked to intellectual impair-
ment in children, as well as blood, repro-
ductive, and nervous systems disorders in 
adults.
 ✓ Cadmium: The highly toxic cadmium bioac-
cumulation is used in older CRTs, recharge-
able batteries, and contacts and switches. 
Exposure to it primarily affects the kidneys 
and bones.
 ✓ Mercury: Used to produce flat-screen dis-
plays, mercury is linked to brain and central 
nervous system disorders, especially during 
the early stages of development.
 ✓ Chromium hexavalent compounds: 
Chromium hexavalent compounds are used 
to produce metal housings and are highly 
toxic and carcinogenic.
 ✓ Polyvinyl chloride (PVC): A plastic that is 
used for insulation on wires and cables in 
some electronics. When produced or dis-
posed of by incineration or burning, PVC 
releases chlorinated dioxins and furans. 
These toxins are highly persistent in the 
environment and are toxic in even low con-
centrations.

Many municipalities collect household hazardous waste, such as dead com-
puters and VCRs, and a growing number of public and private organizations 
offer local, statewide, national, and international programs to collect, accept, 
and properly process and dispose of e-waste.
An increasing number of computer, cellphone, and consumer electronics 
manufacturers offer take-back e-cycling programs to accept not only their 
own brand of once-new-now-e-waste products, but also products made and 
sold by competitors. Some of the programs are free, and others require you 
to pay a processing fee, cover the cost of shipping, or both.
Finding E-Cyclers
The World Wide Web is the most useful tool for finding companies, organiza-
tions, and services to collect, process, and dispose of your e-waste.
Visiting your local city, town, or state government’s Web site is a good place 
to start.
Reputable or not?
With public awareness about the harmful environmental effects caused by 
companies and recyclers who export e-waste overseas on the rise, finding 
ones that “do the right thing” matters.
Helping take some of the guesswork out of finding responsible recyclers is 
the e-Stewards program (www.e-stewards.org). Formed by The Basel 
Action Network and the Electronics TakeBack Campaign, the e-Stewards Web 
site lists national and mail-in recyclers that meet super-stringent criteria for 
globally responsible recycling.
However, until many more qualifying e-Stewards recyclers are within reach of 
the nation’s population, your other e-waste disposal options are many — pos-
sibly even on the street where you live.
Local or from a distance?
If you live in a city or large town, an e-waste recycler or drop-off location is 
probably close by — such as the lumber company two blocks from my house 
that accepts small e-waste items such as rechargeable batteries and dis-
carded cellphones.

287
 Chapter 16: Recycling and Properly Disposing of Hopelessly Useless Gadgets
The state-run New York City Web site (www.nyc.gov), for instance, explains 
everything city dwellers need to know about recycling and e-cycling in the 
Big Apple, including street-side pickup rules and schedules, drop-off loca-
tions, and lists of manufacturers and retailers that offer take-back e-cycling 
programs and services, with Web site links to learn more.
 
New York City law requires stores that sell rechargeable batteries (or prod-
ucts containing them) to take back dead rechargeable batteries for recycling, 
no purchase necessary (see Figure 16-1). That means tiny hardware stores and 
big-name cellphone and consumer electronics superstores alike must accept 
your gift of dead recyclable cells — no wonder Manhattan is called the world’s 
melting pot!
Considering what kind of unwanted gadgets and useless electronics you’re 
disposing often determines where you can drop off or ship your e-waste.

Small stuff is usually easier to unload than bigger items such as TVs, comput-
ers, and burned out VCRs. Now that gadget and computer makers, and retail-
ers, have gotten hip to the message that being green is a good thing in the 
public’s eye, more and more corporations offer take-back recycling services.
Some are close by, such as the Radio Shack or Apple Store at the local mall, 
and others — including Dell, HP, and Apple — offer mail-in take-back 
programs.
Either way, finding an e-cycler with a good track record of responsible 
e-waste disposal begins with a visit to one or more Web sites run by 
e-cycling-friendly organizations and corporations.
Finding a local e-cycler
Finding a responsible e-cycler in your city or town starts with a visit to your 
computer and the Internet. The following list highlights some starting points 
to find an e-cycler near you:
 
✓ Your state or city Web site: Most states follow the .gov Web site 
address format. For instance, typing www.nj.gov will take you to my 
home state’s Web site, where a search on recycle turned up links to a 
directory of statewide recyclers.
Let your fingers do the walking, er, typing
Near the start of this chapter, I state that the 
Web is your best friend when it comes to finding 
an e-cycler, and I’d like to add that the good ol’ 
Yellow Pages are also a useful resource in your 
quest to get rid of hopelessly useless gadgets 
and gear. However, I’m not talking about those 
thick tree-stealing Yellow Pages taking space 
atop the ’fridge or tossed in the coat closet. I’m 
referring to the virtual version: www.yellow
pages.com.
Mobile versions optimized for cellphones and 
smartphones make it easy to find a recycler 
near you — literally, if your device has built-in 
GPS to mark your exact location on the map like 
the version for the iPhone. Tap the recycler’s 
listed address and the iPhone opens the built-
in Google Maps program and displays the loca-
tion and even directions to get there from your 
location.
Finding the same visually helpful maps is just as 
easy with your computer and Web browser. Go 
to http://maps.google.com, type your 
zip code to home in on your location, type recy-
cle in the Search field, and then click Search 
Maps.

289
 Chapter 16: Recycling and Properly Disposing of Hopelessly Useless Gadgets
 
 Visiting www.usa.gov/Agencies/State_and_Territories.shtml 
provides links to every U.S. state’s Web site. You can find a complete list 
of cities, counties, and towns at www.usa.gov/Agencies/Local_
Government/Cities.shtml.
 
 Accessing cities and towns with the .gov domain isn’t as common as 
statewide .gov domain Web site addresses. The Web address www.
nyc.gov takes you to the Big Apple’s Web site, while the City of Los 
Angeles’s Web site is accessed by typing either the not-so-obvious Web 
address www.ci.la.ca.us, or the somewhat more intuitive lacity.org.
 
✓ The Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation Call2Recycle data-
base: Looking to immediately unload some dead recyclable batteries 
before you get into the rest of this e-waste and e-cycling business? Point 
your Web browser to www.rbrc.org to search Rechargeable Battery 
Recycling Corporation’s Call2Recycle database for a drop-off center 
near you.
 
 Chapter 3 is the place to go to learn more about the pluses of replacing 
disposable batteries with rechargeable cells.
 
✓ The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): Checking your state’s 
environmental agency Web site for electronics recyclers is another 
option. Go to www.epa.gov/epahome/state.htm to access the 
Environmental Protection Agency’s directory of state agencies. (See 
Figure 16-2.)

Many state and city Web sites also link to national recycling organizations 
and programs. For instance, type what you’re getting rid of and your zip code 
on Montana’s Where to Recycle Web page (www.deq.mt.gov/Recycle/
Where-to-Recycle_New.asp), and a list of nearby e-cycling organizations 
and facilities opens, compliments of Earth911.com, which calls itself “your 
one-stop shop for all you need to know about reducing your impact, reusing 
what you’ve got and recycling your trash.”
Searching for locations to discard a dead cellphone near my ZIP code led me 
to a list of nearby recycling facilities, including office retail superstore Staples 
(www.staples.com/recycle) — a nationwide corporation (which happens 
to provide the perfect segue to my next topic).
National and corporate e-cycling programs
Shipping or dropping off your useless gadgets, computers, and other high-
tech gizmos to nationwide organizations, recycling partners, and corpora-
tions is fast becoming a practical and reasonably convenient way to get rid of 
e-waste.
Accessing Web sites for more information about participating organizations 
and companies sometimes leads you right back to where you started — your 
own city or town, or one nearby.
Cashing in e-waste the EZ way
Planning to buy a new gadget to replace the one you’re getting rid of? As I mention in Chapter 14, a 
number of Web-based companies let you trade in your dead or unwanted gadgets and other elec-
tronic stuff for cash. One such trade-in Web site is EZtradein.com. Use the site’s Trade In Estimator 
to see whether trading in your outdated, dying, or dead item can kick back cash or a Best Buy gift 
card. EZtradein.com accepts

 ✓ Camcorders
 ✓ Cameras
 ✓ Car audio

Erasing Personal Information
In Chapter 15, I explain how getting rid of personal information before dispos-
ing of unwanted computers and gadgets protects your identity from possible 
theft by potentially unscrupulous buyers or benefactors. Permanently eras-
ing contacts, phone numbers, pictures, e-mails, and other personal informa-
tion from cellphones, smartphones, and other portable gadgets is generally 
fast and simple.
 
Rather than leave the task of permanently erasing my identity to the unknown, 
I always perform the “disk-wiping” process described in Chapter 15. However, 
skipping the disk-wipe steps in favor of a heavy hammer (I’m serious!) is an 
option if you’re willing and able to physically remove the hard drive from the 
desktop or notebook. Removing a few screws or turning a couple of knobs on 
the side or back of many desktop PCs provides easy access to the insides. 
Removing a few screws from the underside of most notebooks usually pro-
vides access to the hard disk (see Figure 16-3).

 Chapter 16: Recycling and Properly Disposing of Hopelessly Useless Gadgets
You smash up a hard disk to make it unreadable the same way in either case:
 
1. Remove the hard drive from the computer.
 
 If you’re not sure how to identify which part is the hard drive, ask a 
techie friend to show you.
 
2. Place the hard drive on a solid surface such as a workbench or con-
crete floor.
 
3. Hammer the heck out of the hard drive, making sure to whack all 
sides and edges to ensure structural damage to the disk inside.
 
4. (Optional) Use a heavy-gauge screwdriver or similar pointed tool 
to hammer holes through the hard drive and ensure it’s truly 
unreadable.
 
5. When you’re satisfied your handiwork has rendered the hard disk 
unreadable, put down the hammer.
 
 Be sure to collect any loose bits that may break away, to include with 
the computer, smashed hard drive, and any other parts or peripherals 
you’re dropping off or shipping to a recycler.
 
Hammering the heck out of a hard drive not only renders it unreadable, it’s 
also surprisingly gratifying — especially when the hard drive taking the beat-
ing crashed, causing you a little digital heartbreak of your own.
Deciding Whether to Break Down 
E-Waste or Leave It Whole
Disassembling or breaking down gadgets, electronics, or computers into 
parts and pieces is rarely necessary before dropping off or sending these 
unwanted things to recyclers or e-cycling programs.
Call or check the recycler’s or take-back program’s Web site for Frequently 
Asked Questions (FAQ) or guidelines to determine whether you need to 
break down what you’re getting rid of.
Keeping useful parts
 
Sometimes it’s wise to break down or remove certain parts from some gad-
gets. Removing the memory modules from a relatively new notebook that 
drowned in the swimming pool, for instance, can save money and boost per-
formance on the replacement system — assuming the memory modules still 
work.

298
Part V: Ridding Yourself of Gadgets the Green Way 
Repurposing an internal hard drive to work as an external backup device for 
another computer is another option, thanks to kits such as the one shown 
in Figure 16-4. It turns an unused PC hard drive into a useful external backup 
drive.
 
Figure 16-4: 
The Samba 
turns an 
internal 
hard drive 
into an 
external 
drive.
 
Consider keeping these parts to reuse, give away, or sell:
 
✓ Hard drives (desktop and notebook PCs)
 
✓ Internal memory modules (desktop and notebook PCs)
 
✓ Removable memory cards (digital cameras, camcorders, PDAs, cell-
phones, and notebook computers)
 
✓ Cellphone and smartphone SIM cards (transfer yours to the new mobile 
phone you’ve acquiring to replace the one you’re getting rid of)
Peripherals and other parts and pieces
Getting rid of unwanted computers and other gadgets often means also dis-
posing of related stuff such as printers, mice, keyboards, installation CDs, 
manuals, and ink and toner cartridges.
Most take-back programs accept these things when you drop off or send in a 
computer. Check before you say goodbye.
 
Tossing out-of-date manuals with your weekly paper recycling is fine — just be 
sure to break down manuals with plastic covers and binders, and recycle sep-
arately. Ditto for plastic installation disk binders, sleeves, and packaging.

Ten Cool Green PC Peripherals 
and Accessories
T
ricking out your Windows or Mac desktop or notebook PC with green 
monitors, printers, and other earth-conscious add-ons can help you 
round out your effort to minimize your computer’s carbon footprint.
The products in this chapter were selected for noteworthy sensitivity to the 
environment, and though you may wind up selecting a different model, know-
ing what makes these products green can help you choose the one that’s 
right for you.
PC TrickleSaver
http://tricklestar.com
Powering off all the peripherals connected to your computer is the magic act 
the PC TrickleSaver performs when you turn off your machine. Abracadabra, 
instant death to the energy vampires!
Turn your PC on, and the undead come back to life. Lather, rinse, repeat.
Ecobutton
www.eco-button.com
Putting your computer to sleep when you walk away is a heck of a lot easier 
when you have a glowing green ecobutton nearby to remind you.
Plug the ecobutton into your PC’s USB port, set it next to your keyboard 
or notebook, give it a tap, and within seconds your computer switches to 
energy-saving mode.

Tap again to wake your PC and an included program displays how many 
carbon units (and how much power and money) you’ve saved by doing the 
button thang.
Bamboo Laptop Stand Workstation
http://kangaroomstorage.com
Okay, I admit this one’s a stretch because it isn’t a high-tech add-on. But the 
Kangaroom bamboo laptop stand workstation can bring the warm and invit-
ing texture of bamboo to your notebook and keep it cool at the same time, 
thanks to a wide vent in the middle that allows your computer’s underside 
fans to breathe freely. Cooler-running computers consume less energy.
What’s more — or less, when it comes to clutter — is the space beneath the 
stand for secreting a power strip, plus two side pocket “docks” for storing 
and charging your mobile phone, music player, or other portable gadget.
SimpleTech [re]drive R500U 
500 GB Turbo
www.simpletech.com
Accented with bamboo, the SimpleTech [re]drive is enclosed in 100 percent 
recyclable aluminum, which acts as a heat sink, cooling the drive without 
using additional energy or creating noise.
How green is the [re]drive? SimpleTech says your total power savings could 
equal up to 90 percent when compared to traditional external drives — 
which is the equivalent of reducing approximately 475 pounds of carbon 
dioxide emissions over the life of the drive.
Lenovo ThinkVision L197 Wide 
19-inch LCD Display
http://lenovo.com

 Chapter 17: Ten Cool Green PC Peripherals and Accessories
Earning a coveted Gold Certified label from the Electronic Product 
Environmental Tool (EPEAT), the Lenovo ThinkVision 197 Wide draws 25 per-
cent less power than its predecessors. Drawing up to 20 watts when turned 
on and cranked to full brightness, the display barely sips a single watt in 
standby mode.
Apple 24-inch LED Cinema Display
www.apple.com
Apple’s highly recyclable LED Cinema Display has a built-in iSight camera, 
mic, and speakers, to turn your MacBook into a desktop computer; keyboard 
and mouse not included.
Like other LED-type displays, this one instantly delivers full-screen bright-
ness when you turn it on. It’s also free of environmentally harmful mercury, 
the glass used in the display is arsenic-free, and the internal cables and com-
ponents are BFR- and PVC-free.
Ink2image Bulk Ink System
http://ink2image.com
Take your Epson or Canon printer, mix with the Ink2image bulk ink system 
and what does that equal?
An estimated savings of more than $450 on money you would otherwise spend 
replacing the equivalent of 64 inkjet cartridges. The Ink2image bulk reservoirs 
continuously feed the printer with a fresh supply of inks, eliminating the need 
to change cartridges ever again. Now that’s what I call sustainability!
Canon Generation Green Printers
www.canon.com
The new Canon Generation Green printers, including the MP180, draw around 
3 watts in stand-by mode, which is considerably less than the 20 watts that 
non–ecofriendly printers draw.

306
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
A 4-in-1 and 2-in-1 printing option for stretching multiple pages across just 
one — a technique you can do with most printers — cuts your printer’s 
paper consumption by up to 75 percent.
Flipping discarded pages over and printing on the other side can double the 
potential paper savings. Every last scrap counts!
D-Link DGL-4500 Xtreme N 
Gaming Router
http://dlink.com
Some devices, such as broadband modems and home Wi-Fi routers, may 
need to stay on most of the time if other folks in your house are tapping into 
them when you’re not.
The D-Link DGL-4500 wireless router can sense whether a computer or video 
game console plugged into one of its Ethernet ports is off, and then put 
that port into a reduced-power sleep mode. It also gauges the length of the 
Ethernet cable, trimming power consumption for shorter lengths.
A Wi-Fi scheduling feature lets you program when the radio turns on and off, 
which can further increase energy savings. Sorry, Junior, when the DGL-4500 
cuts the connection to Xbox Live at bedtime, it’s game over — no ifs, ands, or 
buts.
Netgear 3G Broadband Wireless Router
www.netgear.com
Paying your mobile carrier for a 3G wireless plan for anywhere-you-go 
Internet access can be less of a pinch on your wallet when you tap into the 
Netgear 3G mobile broadband wireless router.
With it, you can create instant Wi-Fi hotspots at events, campsites, home 
offices, or most any other remote location where you can pick up your car-
rier or service provider’s 3G signal. Like other Netgear Green models, an on/
off switch lets you cut the juice when it’s not in use. 3G modem, data plan, 
and mosquito repellant sold separately.

Ten Green Gadget Designs
A
t this year’s Greener Gadgets 2009 Conference in Manhattan, 
judges presented the top ten finalists in its Greener Gadgets Design 
Competition. The ten finalists were winnowed from 50 entries by visitors 
who voted for their favorite on the conference’s Web site, http://greener
gadgets.com. In this chapter, I describe the ten finalists (can you guess 
which design took the top prize?) and then reveal the winners.
The prizes awarded were as green as it gets: cash!
Bware Water Meter
Knowing how much water is flowing from the faucet or shower is the driv-
ing purpose of the imaginary Bware water meter. The meter’s digital display 
draws power from the running water (so batteries are unnecessary), and a 
more advanced version with WiFi taps into your home network so that you 
can log how much water you’re drawing from the well.
Laundry Pod
After learning about resourceful women who used salad spinners to wash 
their delicates, the designer of the Laundry Pod decided it was time to build 
a better, well, panties spinner. Giving new meaning to “Don’t get your pant-
ies in a twist,” the human-powered pod washes, rinses, and spins small loads 
without wasting the energy or water normally used by traditional washing 
machines. Croutons and Thousand Island dressing sold separately.

308
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Social-Environmental Station: The 
Environmental Traffic Light
Designed to communicate environmentally threatening information, such as 
carbon emissions and other difficult to perceive eco-altering factors, such as 
air pressure and humidity. Inspired by the ubiquitous traffic light, it remains 
to be seen — should the concept ever see the light of day — whether Green 
Police will ticket drivers of gas-guzzlers caught running a C02 red light.
Indoor Drying Rack
Citing 96 million apartment dwellers in the United States who live without 
access to a clothesline, and nearly half as many who live without clothes 
dryers, the indoor drying rack comes to their rescue. No, it isn’t a gadget, but 
the recycled aluminum and bamboo laminated design concept would be the 
perfect gift for that special Laundry Pod undergarment-spinner someone in 
your life.
Thermal Touch
Combining the heat-seeking smarts of a thermal camera with a portable 
projector, the thermal touch would instantly reveal energy-escaping cracks 
or insulation inefficiencies by simply waving it over walls, window frames, 
and other surfaces. Scanning bundled-up little ones before sending them off 
to school on a winter’s day wasn’t mentioned, but there’s no reason why it 
wouldn’t work, right? Isn’t playing let’s-pretend fun!
Fastronauts
Childhood obesity? Disposable batteries that poison the ground beneath 
landfills? Look, up in the sky! It’s Fastronauts to the rescue! Playing with the 
ecofriendly action figures juices up the built-in batteries, and a handlebar-
mounted “rocket” would convert peddling into power for a headlight or 
speedometer. If you’re tired of the toy, break apart the shell and recycle it 
into a new one. It’s a toy that keeps on giving!

309
 Chapter 18: Ten Green Gadget Designs
Tweet-a-Watt
Modifying a Kill A Watt power meter with “off the shelf” components, the 
Tweet-a-Watt taps into your Twitter social network account to “tweet,” at the 
end of the day, the number of kilowatts of power you’ve used. The designers 
suggest multiple units for monitoring an entire household. The ultimate goal? 
Fellow tweeters will compete to see who can go the lowest. And they just 
may, because this one-upon-a-time concept was a working gizmo when the 
conference took place.
Standby Monsters
Growing up, the designer of Standby Monsters said she always thought there 
was something sinister about standby lights. According to the International 
Energy Agency, there is: An estimated 5 to 15 percent of the world’s domestic 
electricity is wasted by electronic devices idling their time in standby mode. 
Slap adhesive-backed Standby Monsters over gadgets and devices in your 
house and glowing red eyes stare back, scaring you into action. Pull the plug!
Power-Hog
Plug the Power-Hog tail into an outlet, then plug a TV, video game console 
or other powered device into its snout, and feed the little porker a coin for 
30 minutes of play time. When the Power-Hog blinks red, it’s time to fork 
over more allowance or else it’s game over. How parents prevent kids from 
bypassing the energy-savings-starved piglet and plugging directly into the 
wall was not disclosed.
WattBlocks
Bending over to turn off or unplug power strips to stop energy vampires 
plugged into them can be a pain the neck. Or back, which is why the designer 
of WattBlocks envisioned a switch that cuts the proverbial cord with a tap of 
your foot. Talk about really putting your foot down once and for all!

Ten Green Gadget Buying Tips
B
efore plunking down your hard-earned green on new (and not so new) 
gadgets, the ten buying tips in this chapter can help reduce your nega-
tive impact on the planet — and on your bank account.
Don’t Buy!
It might sound crazy to start a list of green gadget buying tips with the 
advice not to buy them, but there’s a rhyme to my seeming lack of reason. 
Throughout this book, I talk about the three Rs — reduce, reuse, recycle — 
and the bonus R, rethink. So I urge you to rethink whether you truly need 
that new desktop computer. Upgrading what you already own is an excellent 
way to reduce and reuse a gadget while also putting off its recycle date.
If the gadget you’re thinking about replacing is still working, or if it can be 
repaired or upgraded so that it can continue to serve you, maybe you don’t 
even need the new gadget.
See Chapters 4, 7, and 8 to read more about getting the most out of gadgets 
you already own.
Do Your Homework
Figuring out whether a company’s green claims are true, false or somewhere 
in the middle can be next to impossible. Fortunately, many companies are 
pulling back the veil and making public their environmental impact on many 
or all levels, including internal practices and policies for reducing consump-
tion. In addition, many companies are detailing the resources and processes 
involved in producing, packaging, and distributing the electronic products 
they sell.

314
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Even so, sorting through what’s real and what’s greenwashing (making mis-
leading or false claims regarding a company’s green practices and its prod-
ucts) can be dizzying. According to the Consumer Electronics Association 
(CEA) at MyGreenElectronics.org, the good news is that many more con-
sumer electronics being produced have these qualities:
 
✓ They contain fewer or no harmful chemicals or toxins.
 
✓ They’re more energy efficient.
 
✓ They’re easier to upgrade, repair, and recycle.
To find out whether gadgets you’re thinking about buying are green, visit the 
following Web sites that evaluate, rate, and list greener electronics by cat-
egory, brand, or other criteria:
 
✓ MyGreenElectronics.org: http://mygreenelectronics.org
 
✓ Greener Choices: http://greenerchoices.org
 
✓ Energy Star: www.energystar.gov
 
✓ Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT): 
www.epeat.net
Chapter 9 has more pointers on making your way through greenwash hype. 
The other chapters in Part IV can also help you buy smarter when shopping 
for green gadgets.
Buy Recycled and Highly Recyclable
When doing your homework, pay attention to whether the gadgets you’re 
thinking about buying are made from recycled materials. For example, the 
Apple MacBook notebook computers are built around a recycled, and highly 
recyclable, aluminum chassis. Additionally, the Motorola MOTO W233 Renew 
mobile phone is encased in housing made entirely from recycled water bottles.
When it comes to printing supplies, the Web site Verdant Computing (www.
verdantcomputing.com) sells green printer inks and toners in remanufac-
tured cartridges. Printing on recycled paper — and using both sides of the 
page — can instantly cut your consumption and waste output in half.
See Chapter 16 to find out more about how to properly dispose of or recycle 
gadgets that have reached the end of their lifecycles.

315
 Chapter 19: Ten Green Gadget Buying Tips
Buy Reconditioned or Preowned
Buying reconditioned or preowned gadgets is a greener choice than buying 
new ones, for two reasons:
 
✓ Fewer resources and energy are wasted.
 
✓ You save money.
Many major computer manufacturers — including Apple, HP, and Dell — sell 
refurbished desktops and notebooks. Other outlets for purchasing refur-
bished or used but still useful gadgets include
 
✓ The auction Web site eBay
 
✓ Your local newspaper’s classified ads
 
✓ Craigslist.org, the regional community classifieds Web site
The buyback Web site EZTradein.com buys unwanted gadgets and then 
resells them at a reasonable discount. The giveaway Web site Freecycle.org 
proves that there is such a thing as a free lunch (or gadget); you just might 
find what you’re looking for there without subtracting cash from your wallet.
Buy Small, Think Big Picture
As my grandmother used to say, “Don’t fill your plate unless you’re going 
to eat it all.” In green gadget–speak, if a notebook computer can serve your 
computing needs, buy a notebook rather than a desktop model. Doing so is 
kinder to the environment because notebooks require fewer resources to 
manufacture, package, ship, operate, and eventually recycle than desktops, 
their bigger carbon footprint brethren.
The same ecoconscious principle applies to high-definition TVs (HDTVs). 
Buying an HDTV that’s sized ju-u-u-ust right for the room is the greener way 
to go rather than choosing the biggest (and most energy draining) HDTV 
money can buy.
Match your green gadget purchases to the purposes they serve as efficiently 
as possible. Think less is more, and you’ll make a smaller negative impact on 
the planet while achieving positive energy efficiency and savings gains for the 
life of your appropriately sized gadgets.

316
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Take a Bite Out of Energy Vampires
To know them is to unplug them. I’m talking about energy vampires (the 
horror-movie way of saying standby power). Energy vampires are products 
that continue to draw power even when they’re turned off. Big-time offenders 
(such as TVs) appear to be off when you press Off; in truth, they’re still sip-
ping power to put the picture on the screen more quickly the next time you 
turn them on.
Smaller-scale energy vampires (such as cellphone chargers, video game con-
soles, and DVD players) are no less guilty as charged, so to speak, when it 
comes to wasting energy and costing you extra bucks on your energy bill.
The good news: More and more new electronics are designed to use the 
smallest amount of energy when they’re in Standby mode or fully charged. 
Two examples: The Sony Bravia VE5 high-definition TV (HDTV) draws almost 
zero power when it’s in Standby mode, and the Samsung E200 Eco mobile 
phone features a built-in alarm that reminds you to unplug the charger when 
the battery is fully charged.
To take a bite out of the energy your gadgets waste, I recommend that you 
invest in a power strip. Then you can plug several gadgets into it and cut the 
power at one time with the flick of a switch. It’s a supercheap way to mini-
mize energy consumption while increasing the savings on your electric bill.
See Chapters 1 and 2 to find out more about energy vampires and smart 
power strips.
Make the Most of Multifunction Gadgets
In the really old days, I might have, at any given moment, carried a cellphone, 
Nintendo Game Boy handheld video game player, CD player, and Palm Pilot 
personal digital assistant (PDA). When cellphones grew smarter and turned 
into smartphones by integrating the PDA with the phone, and CDs gave way 
to iPods that can also play simple arcade games, such as Pac-Man, four gad-
gets were reduced to two. And by buying my iPhone, two gadgets have been 
reduced to just one.
When buying new gadgets, choose ones with multifunction attributes, such 
as the iPhone and Palm Pre smartphones. This strategy helps you help the 
environment by reducing the materials and energy necessary to manufacture, 
ship, and operate multiple devices, and by reducing the number of chargers 

317
 Chapter 19: Ten Green Gadget Buying Tips
you have to plug in. One seemingly small step for you and your gadget, one 
relatively big step for Mother Earth.
See Chapter 11 to find out more about gadgets that are greener because they 
offer multiple functions.
Charge Your Gadgets the Green Way
Choosing green portable power chargers and extenders is the ecofriendlier 
alternative to tapping into the wall outlet to recharge gadgets. What makes 
these gadgets green? Some use solar or wind power to recharge your gad-
gets. For instance, the Iqua SUN solar Bluetooth headset recharges itself 
when exposed to daylight, and the HY Mini wind-powered charger can be 
strapped to your arm or bicycle to recharge your mobile phone, digital 
camera, or other portable gadget.
Human-powered chargers that convert your elbow grease or movement 
are also examples of green chargers. Two products from Freeplay (www.
freeplayenergy.com) are the Freecharge Weza foot-powered portable 
generator, and the multifaceted Companion, a radio, flashlight, and cellphone 
charger all in one. The Companion has a solar panel and a hand crank to 
charge both it and your other gadgets. See Chapter 12 to find out more about 
greener chargers.
Buying rechargeable batteries (a topic I cover in Chapter 3) for your home’s 
remote controls and other battery-operated gizmos is friendlier to the envi-
ronment than continually buying and throwing away single-use batteries.
Get Rid of Gadgets the Green Way
Donating working, unused gadgets expends fewer resources than sending 
them for recycling. Selling or trading in unwanted, working gadgets (in some 
cases, even broken ones) is another way you can do the right thing.
Properly dispose of hopelessly useless gadgets by dropping them off at, or 
sending them to, an electronics recycling organization, corporate take-back 
program, or nearby electronics recycler or retail store, such as a mobile 
phone outlet. It’s the responsible way to dispose of gadgets at the end of 
their lifecycles.
For more about getting rid of gadgets the green way, check out Part V.

318
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Buy Carbon Offsets to Minimize 
Your Carbon Footprint
No matter how energy efficient the gadgets you buy and own are, or how effi-
ciently you use them, there’s no getting around the fact that they’ll continue 
to contribute to the carbon footprints they generate over their lifetimes — 
and to the overall carbon footprint you create over the span of your lifetime.
Simply put, a carbon footprint is the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2), also 
referred to as greenhouse gases, a person produces as he goes about his day-
to-day living. Manufacturing, packaging, shipping, shelving, buying, using, 
maintaining, and eventually disposing of gadgets all contribute to your total 
carbon footprint.
Buying carbon offsets from a Web site, such as the nonprofit Carbonfund.org, 
is an easy and affordable way to help reduce your carbon footprint and its 
impact on the planet. Carbon offsets provide an indirect means of offsetting 
your carbon footprint by financing activities and actions that help to improve 
the environment.
I say indirect because you’re not the one (or group) who actually participates 
in, or carries out, the activities and actions. (Direct actions you can take to 
reduce your carbon footprint include installing solar panels on your roof to 
cut down on energy consumption, or donating your car to charity and riding 
a bike for the rest of your life.) Indirect action finances activities that fight 
global warming; programs include renewable energy, energy efficiency, and 
global reforestation projects that reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the 
threat of climate change.
Buying carbon offsets not only helps combat and reduce global warming, it 
also affords you a partial deduction on your tax return. For more on the fine 
print of donation deductions, check out the Chapter 14 sidebar, “Deducing 
donation deductions.”

Ten Frequently Asked Questions 
about Green Gadgets
W
hat’s a green gadget? Who is EPEAT, and why does he spell his name 
that way? Should I recycle my ancient but still working cellphone? 
And, are Energy Star and OnStar still dating, or am I confusing them with 
another celebrity couple?
Ask and ye shall receive.
And now, for my final number, answers to ten of the most frequently asked 
questions about green gadgets.
What Is a Green Gadget?
In Chapter 1, I pay homage to that ol’ Brenda Lee hit “Break It to Me Gently,” 
by explaining ever so delicately what a green gadget is and what it is not. 
Because of space considerations, I have no choice other than to take the 
tough love approach and give it to you straight: There’s no such thing as a 
green gadget.
Yes, gadgets come in different colors, including green, like the Apple iPod 
nano. And yes, as I mention in Chapter 11, the environmental activism orga-
nization Greenpeace lavished praise on Apple for eliminating the toxic sub-
stances brominated flame retardant (BFR) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) from 
its newest iPods. But even a green iPod absent of toxic substances is not a 
green gadget. That’s because gadgets contain electronics, and as such, they 
can never be 100 percent environmentally friendly, or green.
The materials and energy used to manufacture, package, ship, operate, and 
dispose of gadgets makes them, by nature, contributors to the carbon diox-
ide (CO2) gases that cause global warming. When improperly disposed of, 
incinerated gadgets can release poisons into the atmosphere; when buried,

they can break down and cause hazardous substances to seep into the 
Earth’s soil and water sources. Both affect the environment and can cause 
illness and even death to the people living in regions polluted by electronic 
waste, also known as e-waste.
Even so, a gadget — a particular cellphone model, for example — can be 
greener than another model, and I discuss those models throughout this 
book. A gadget’s greenness is gauged by numerous factors, including:
 
✓ Environmental friendliness of the building-materials collection process
 
✓ Manufacturing process
 
✓ Packaging and shipping process
 
✓ Operating efficiency when you’re using it — and when you’re not using it
 
✓ Ease of upgrading (so that you don’t have to buy a new one to replace it)
 
✓ Ease of breakdown into recoverable parts and substances to be used to 
create new gadgets
 
In other words, when I say, “green gadgets,” I’m referring to the big-picture 
subject of “greener” electronic products. Those designed and built with a 
greater sensitivity to the environment by companies that strive to decrease 
their carbon footprints by using environmentally friendlier manufacturing pro-
cesses, packaging and distribution systems, greater energy efficiency, and 
more thorough recyclability when products reach the end of their life cycles.
Why Should I Care about 
Buying Green Gadgets?
Buying green gadgets helps to lessen the multitude of negative effects that 
electronic products have on the environment. Put another way: By buying 
green gadgets, and using them responsibly, you’re making an effort to reduce 
your carbon footprint.
To use a gadget responsibly involves, for example, turning it off when you 
aren’t using it, using it to its fullest capacity (see Chapter 19 for more about 
this topic), and donating or properly recycling it when you no longer need 
the thing.
See Part IV for information about smart green gadget shopping.

 Chapter 20: Ten Frequently Asked Questions about Green Gadgets
What Is EPEAT?
The lengthily named Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool, 
also known as EPEAT, is a procurement tool — it aims to help you find out 
whether desktop computers, notebooks, and monitors are environmentally 
friendly, and if so, to what level, based on various environmental criteria.
Here’s my Average Joe translation: Visit the EPEAT Web site (www.epeat.
net) to find out whether a product you’re thinking of buying earned an 
EPEAT rating, and if so, whether it’s Bronze, Silver, or Gold. (See the EPEAT 
Web site or Chapter 1 for more about the Bronze, Silver, and Gold ratings.)
Which Electronic Products 
Does EPEAT Cover?
EPEAT evaluates desktop computers, notebooks, and monitors. As I write 
this chapter, two groups of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics 
Engineers (IEEE) are working on a system to evaluate printers, imaging 
devices, and televisions.
What Is Energy Star?
Energy Star is a two-partner program made up of the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Its aim is 
to help folks buy and use energy-efficient appliances and electronics prod-
ucts; Energy Star-supported products help consumers lessen their negative 
impact on the environment.
Manufacturers voluntarily participate in the Energy Star labeling program, 
introduced by the EPA in 1992. The program was originally designed to help 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by making it easy for buyers to identify and 
recognize more energy-efficient computers and monitors.
You can now find the Energy Star label on more than 60 product categories, 
including TVs, DVD players, refrigerators, fax machines, light fixtures, win-
dows, cordless phones, even commercial fryers and ice machines.
According to the EPA, buying and using products and appliances that bear 
the Energy Star logo helps save as much as 30 percent on a typical household 
energy bill of $2,000 per year. That’s $700 in greenbacks that would otherwise 
fly out of your wallet if you didn’t choose Energy Star products.

322
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
How Does a Product Earn the Energy 
Star Seal of Approval?
In simple terms, a product must adhere to strict energy-efficiency guidelines 
established by the EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy. Check out the fol-
lowing link to find out more about those guidelines:
www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=product_specs.pt_product_
specs
Two examples of criteria that computers and monitors must meet to qualify 
for Energy Star certification include:
 
✓ Energy use: The device must use as little energy as possible when it’s in 
operation.
 
✓ Auto shutoff or standby: The device must have automatic shut-off or 
standby capabilities.
What Is the “Change the World, Start 
with Energy Star” Campaign?
Aiming to get you aboard the “go green” express, the “Change the World, 
Start with Energy Star” campaign encourages you to take small steps to 
reduce your energy consumption. You can find the campaign’s Web site at
www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=globalwarming.
showPledgeHome
Some of the small steps you can pledge to take include entering the number 
of lights in your home you’ll replace with Energy Star qualified lights, prom-
ising to activate your computer’s Sleep mode, and committing to setting or 
programming your thermostat to use less or no energy when you’re away 
from home or sleeping.

 Chapter 20: Ten Frequently Asked Questions about Green Gadgets
Should I Donate or Recycle 
My Old Computer?
This FAQ requires a two-part answer:
 
✓ Donate if your computer is less than five years old and still functions. 
Chances are good that someone can benefit from your giveaway. Even 
if your computer’s Windows or Macintosh operating system (OS) is no 
longer running like it should, most donation programs wipe the hard 
drive and reinstall the OS before finding a new home for your unwanted 
computer.
 
✓ Recycle if your notebook or desktop PC is beyond repair and is “hope-
lessly useless.” Be sure to take it or send it to a reputable electronic 
waste (e-waste) recycler, or have it picked up; it’s the green thing to do, 
as I explain in Chapter 16.
 
If you’re donating your computer, include the keyboard, mouse, monitor (if 
it’s a desktop computer rather than a notebook), and any manuals and instal-
lation discs. Speaking of those discs, you can always use them to reformat the 
computer’s hard drive and reinstall the OS and any bundled applications that 
may have come preinstalled on the computer when you purchased it.
Whether you donate or recycle your computer, be sure to check out Chapter 
15 to find out how to deauthorize applications and the ability to play pur-
chased content (such as music or movies you purchased from the iTunes 
Store) on the machine you’re disposing of. Doing so enables you to install 
and run the programs and play the media on your new machine.
Chapter 15 also describes how to erase your hard drive securely before get-
ting rid of your gadgets and computers to prevent potential snoops from 
accessing your personal information.
Should I Donate or Recycle 
My Old Cellphone?
The same two-part answer from the preceding section applies to old cell-
phones, too. If your cellphone stills works, you can find a program that puts 
the device in the hands of abuse victims, the elderly, or people who cannot 

324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
afford one. If your phone is broken, on the other hand, and impossible (or 
too expensive) to repair, check out Chapter 14 to find take-back and recycling 
programs for smartphones and other handheld gadgets.
Believe it or not, you may even be able to pocket a little cash for your dis-
card — even if you accidentally smashed the screen, as was the case with my 
original iPhone.
Should I Recycle My Old 
Rechargeable Batteries?
Yes. To find out how, turn to Chapter 3.
