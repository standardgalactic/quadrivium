For my very own signing babies, Darby Grace, Aidan Elizabeth, and
Cole Thomas. And for my wonderful husband, Billy — their amazing
signing daddy.

Author’s Acknowledgments
What a joy to acknowledge just some of the people who helped
make this book possible. I feel like I’ve just birthed my fourth baby,
taking five months of hard labor to push this book out. You don’t do
that kind of work all alone.
First and foremost, a huge thank-you to Beryt Nisenson, who got
this ball rolling in the first place. Beryt helped me get started teach-
ing classes and then gave me the contact to potentially write this
book — and it worked out. Additionally, she provided limitless sup-
port and love before and during the writing of this book — as I’m
sure she will after this book is finished. You’re an amazing inspira-
tion in so many ways. I’m so grateful you’re my friend. Thank you.
Another thank-you goes out to Jessica Faust, my agent and communi-
cator throughout the entire writing of this book. Thanks for finding
the Web site and contacting us, as well as supporting me directly
throughout.
Generous appreciation goes out to Sandy Blackthorn who held my
hand while I organized my thoughts, let go as needed, and then
turned my thoughts and words into For Dummies thoughts and
words. You’re a great teacher, Sandy! More appreciation goes out to
my project editor, Elizabeth Kuball, who coordinated it all (wow!);
my acquisitions editor, Tracy Boggier, who has supported and
directed throughout; my technical editor, Nancy Mitchum, who
helped keep the ASL as “pure” as it could possibly be in this setting;
and my illustrator, Lisa Reed. Your support and guidance have been
invaluable throughout this project. Thank you.
About halfway into this project, I took a fall, broke my left wrist,
and had a cast on until after the book’s completion (roughly three
months). Needless to say, that made typing just a bit difficult.
Thank you to my typists (you know who you are) for being my 
“fingers,” and sometimes my brain, until the end of the typing.
And thank you to all the editors for all your patience, understanding,
and support through the broken-wrist fiasco. Thank you to Doni for
providing my family with meals every week and giving my family
the chance to eat healthy as I wrote the last quarter of this book.
What an amazing friend.
Karen H., thanks for the coffee breaks. I’m going to miss you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you to Heather for supporting me with
phone calls, e-mails and prayers from start to finish. Without you,
this book may not be here. Love you, girl.
And to those of you in Mother’s Share Group, in Generation Acts, in
the office, at church, and beyond who encouraged me with a quick
smile or word as I attempted to put one foot in front of the other in
the writing of this book, thank you. A special thank-you to those of
you in these same groups who took me “out” in various and sundry
ways when I needed a break.

Thanks to all the grandparents (DeeDee, Grandpa Tom, Pampu,
GranJan, GranT, Pachie-Achie, Pawpaw, and my Memaw) for loving
and supporting me throughout the life of this project. From babysit-
ting at times to gift certificates and general support, you’ve all been
incredible. Thank you.
Without my three signing babies — Darby, Aidan Elizabeth, and
Cole — baby signing might not even be on my radar. Your daddy
and I began signing with you as young infants and you continue to
inspire me and keep me signing with babies, toddlers, their parents,
and beyond. You are such a gift. Thank you.
And to my husband Billy, thank you for putting up with the ups and
downs and ins and outs of my relationship with this book. It’s not
easy to put up with the idiosyncrasies of late hours mixed with
double-duty childcare. What a gift you are. I’m grateful for you
every day. Thank you. I love you.

Baby Signing For Dummies 
xx

Introduction
P
lain and simple, Baby Signing For Dummies is about connect-
ing with your hearing baby or toddler. It’s about building a
bridge between you and what’s going on in your child’s mind: what
she wants, what she needs, what she thinks, and how she feels.
Now, I’m not saying you’ll be able to read her mind. But you will
be able to understand some of the things on her mind before she’s
able to express them with spoken words. This book enables you
and your baby to use American Sign Language (ASL) to communi-
cate long before your baby can speak.
This ability to communicate through sign language reduces
tantrums, which babies throw because they know what they want
and expect you to know, too. In addition, it reduces the frustrations
that parents feel from frantically attempting to interpret babies’
unintelligible grunts and screams. And it increases meaningful
parent-child interactions, which opens the door to untold benefits
for both you and your baby.
I know of what I speak. I have three signing children (and a signing
husband), who have all signed since they were seven months old
or younger (well, not the husband). I began this signing journey
when my oldest was 4 weeks old. A book on a relative’s coffee table
piqued my interest. I held the idea in the back of my mind for a few
weeks as I continued to adjust to my new identity as a mother. Then
one day I saw the book again while browsing at my local bookstore.
Though I had my doubts, I figured it couldn’t hurt to buy the book
and check it out. So I did.
My oldest is now 4 years old and has a signing vocabulary of over
300 signs. So, as you can see, it works! The experience of signing
with my children has changed me from a skeptical new mom
buying yet another parenting book into a teacher who helps other
parents get to know how to sign with their babies and into the
author of the book you hold in your hands. The reason I wrote this
book is to share with you my passion for signing with babies and
to make your entry into the world of signing with your baby as
easy and as joyful as possible.

About This Book
The shelves of bookstores are brimming these days with books
about signing with your baby. This book is different for many rea-
sons. First off, it’s different because it was written from within the
trenches. I have three preschoolers at home. I’ve learned a lot in
the four years I’ve been signing with my babies. Some of what I’ve
learned has been very helpful; some of it not so much. I plan on
sharing the former with you, saving you from repeating my mis-
takes and from wasting your valuable time.
Also, I know you don’t want to be an expert in the field of signing
with babies. I mean, who has time for that? You do, after all, have 
a baby. And you just want to be able to communicate with him as
soon as possible. I hear ya and know first hand where you’re
coming from. To this day, all I want to do is enhance communica-
tion with my children and help other parents do the same in the
easiest and most rewarding way possible.
This book is all about easy and rewarding. The information is laid
out in reference form so you can easily find exactly what you’re
looking for without having to read the book from front to back in
chronological order. The instructions are straightforward. The
illustrations are easy to follow. The stories are all true and draw on
personal experiences. You’ll laugh. You’ll cry. You’ll feel like this
book was written just for you by someone who knows exactly what
you’re going through — because it was.
Conventions Used in This Book
A few conventions are used throughout this book:
 CAPITAL letters are used to indicate ASL signs in the text. For
example, the sign for BATH is covered in Chapter 7.
 Italic type is used to highlight words that are being defined, as
well as to emphasize certain words or points. For example,
American Sign Language is the official name of the official sign
language for the deaf. It’s often referred to as ASL. And I’m
here to tell you that even before babies can control the move-
ments necessary to produce speech, they can control the
movements necessary to produce some ASL signs.
 Boldface type is used to indicate the action part of numbered
steps, such as physically moving your hand into a certain
position. For example, to sign BATH, follow these steps:
Baby Signing For Dummies

1. With both hands, make loose fists, thumbs on top.
2. Place your fists on your chest like you’re Tarzan get-
ting ready to beat on your chest.
3. Move your fists in several circles as if scrubbing
your chest.
 Monofont type is used to indicate Web addresses and e-mail
addresses. When this book was printed, some Web addresses
may have needed to break across two lines of text. If that hap-
pened, rest assured that we haven’t put in any extra charac-
ters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. So, when using
one of these Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see
in this book, pretending as though the line break doesn’t exist.
Something else I should point out is that I’ve made every effort 
to alternate male and female pronouns when referring to babies
throughout this book. I have two girls and a boy, and I love them all
equally. I didn’t get out the calculator and tally up the pronouns
(who has time for that?!), so if there are more of one gender than
another, rest assured that baby signing works equally well with
boys and with girls — my three kids are a testament to that!
What You’re Not to Read
Technically speaking, because this is a reference book and not a
classroom academic text, you can pick and choose what you are
and aren’t going to read. I hope, of course, that you’ll want to read
each and every word. However, know that some material in here is
truly skippable. By that, I mean certain material isn’t essential for
you to know in order to successfully sign with your baby. The
material is still valuable — but in a bonus, supplementary way.
Here’s what you can safely skip:
 The sidebars: You’ll see shaded boxes here and there through-
out the book. They’re sidebars, and they contain side stories
and personal accounts that complement a topic discussed in
the book.
 The appendixes: Tucked neatly into the back of this book are
three appendixes, covering the ASL alphabet, the numbers
one through ten, and some colors. Knowing these signs isn’t
absolutely essential to signing with babies, but many people
ask me about them anyway. I’ve included them in this book in
case you’re interested, too.

Foolish Assumptions
You know the old adage that assumptions can be dangerous. So I
want to be upfront with you and share a few assumptions I made
about the reader (that would be you) as I wrote this book:
 You have a baby or toddler in your life with whom you’d
like to communicate. This book was written for parents and
caregivers like yourself (and like me), whether it’s your first
time in the ring or whether caring for a baby or toddler is old
hat to you.
 You’ve already heard something about signing with babies
that sparked your interest and led you to this book. You may
have seen it in a movie or have friends who use it with their
family. Perhaps you saw an article in a parenting magazine or
a newspaper. Like me, you may simply have been intrigued
when you saw a book about signing with your baby online or
at your local bookstore. This book was written to fan into a
flame that spark of interest.
 You are at least a tad skeptical. Maybe you’re concerned
about the amount of time you’ll have to invest in this whole
signing-with-baby experience. You’re worried how fluent you’ll
have to become in American Sign Language. You’re not sure
signing with babies even works. Maybe it’s just a gimmick or
the latest parenting fad. I’ve faced those doubts and questions
myself and helped countless other parents address them. This
book answers the skeptic’s questions because it’s written by a
former skeptic.
 Most of all, you love your baby. You want what’s best for 
him and hope to give him every advantage you can in life. You
need to know what’s going on in that precious little mind as
you see those wheels spinning. And you’re anxious to open
the lines of communication with him as soon as possible. This
book will help you do this.
How This Book Is Organized
When using a reference book, it’s always helpful to know where 
to find things. So to help you find things in this book, I’ve divided 
it into six parts, each of which contains chapters related to the
theme of that part. Here’s a brief description to help you navigate.
Baby Signing For Dummies

Part I
Talking Hands

In this part . . .
C
an hands talk? You bet they can, and I’m not just
referring to the “talking” they may do when someone
cuts you off in trafﬁc. Hands can also talk through American
Sign Language (ASL), a beautiful and expressive language
used by people of all ages with hearing impairments of
varying degrees. The neat thing is, about 30 years ago
someone stumbled onto the realization that hearing babies
can use sign language to communicate, too — way before
they can actually speak. It took a while for the general
public to catch on, but in recent years, the popularity of
baby signing has skyrocketed.
In Part I of this book, you discover what baby signing is 
all about, some of the research behind it, and why you
should do it with your baby. You also get tips on how to
introduce sign language to your baby and even take a trip
to boot camp for some basic training. Off you go — have a
grand time!

Chapter 1
Getting Onboard with 
Baby Signing
In This Chapter
 Answering frequently asked questions about baby signing
 Trying your first sign — so you can rest assured that you can do this
I
n the course of a typical week, I get tons of questions about
signing with babies. The questions come from inquiring minds
in settings such as play groups, meetings, grocery stores, phone
calls from friends, and, of course the classes I teach on the subject.
Even people who don’t have children in the baby or toddler stage
are typically fascinated with the subject. Imagine . . . a window into
a baby or young child’s mind before he can speak. What a gift to
both parents and children!
In this chapter, I go over some of the most common questions I
encounter on signing with babies. Use this chapter as an opportu-
nity to get comfortable with the concept of baby sign language —
to get onboard, so to speak — and then get ready to open the gift
of signing with your own little sweetie pie.
What Exactly Is Sign Language 
for Babies?
I always enjoy hearing this question because it gives me a chance
to rekindle the initial excitement I felt after asking the same ques-
tion way back when. This question means someone is curious, and
because she’s asking me about signing with babies, it’s my job to
excite her about the subject just as someone once excited me —
and subsequently changed my world.

Many people assume that babies don’t speak because they don’t
understand. But the truth is, babies understand a great deal. Think
about it: Only one thing satisfies a hungry baby, and that’s a full
tummy. And a hungry baby will scream and scream until you give
him the means to fill his tummy. He can’t say, “Hey, you! Feed me!”
But that’s exactly what he’s thinking when he screams until you
feed him.
The reason babies don’t speak isn’t for lack of understanding. It’s
for lack of the ability to control the movements of the mouth and
tongue that are necessary to produce intelligible, audible speech.
Those movements are undeveloped until babies are older. However,
at a much earlier age, babies can control the movements necessary
to produce signs. And as a result of this ability, a world of two-way
communication can be opened for babies and their caregivers.
Which leads, of course, to the answer to the question “What
exactly is sign language for babies?” Sign language for babies is a
method of using either invented hand gestures or American Sign
Language (ASL) to communicate with very young children months
and even years before they can communicate verbally. (Note that
American Sign Language is the official name of the official sign lan-
guage for the deaf. Later in this chapter is a section called “Should
I Use ASL or Make Up My Own Signs?” Take a gander at that section
to get my take on that question.)
Why Should I Sign with My Baby?
Signing with babies provides many benefits. Consider these, for
example:
 Signing gives babies a voice by giving them a way to com-
municate their wants, needs, and observations. Instead of
simply trying to guess what a crying baby needs, for example,
a parent or caregiver can understand the need because the
baby signs MILK or BALL or FINISHED. Of course, this doesn’t
mean the crying stops altogether, but frustration levels are
drastically reduced because — through the signs that the
baby can make — he can communicate some of his specific
wants, needs, and observations. (By the way, I cover the signs
for MILK and FINISHED in Chapter 5, and I show you the sign
for BALL in Chapter 10.)
 According to research done by Baby Signs (www.babysigns.
com), by the time children who signed as babies and toddlers
are in second grade, their IQ scores are an average of 12
points higher than the IQ scores of their non-signing peers.
So, beyond the here-and-now benefits of giving babies a voice
Part I: Talking Hands 
10

and reducing frustration levels, signing has long-term benefits
as well. (See Chapter 13 for details about signing children and
IQ scores, grades, and ADD/ADHD.)
 Speech stimulates a particular part of a person’s brain.
Children who have chatty, interactive parents typically have
more stimulation in the speech center of their brains. That’s
pretty cool in and of itself, but now consider this: Children
who are exposed to a secondary language have stimulation in
an additional part of their brains as they’re exposed to and
learn the language. And here’s the biggie for purposes of this
book: According to research done by Dr. Marilyn Daniels, chil-
dren who sign as part of their language development have
stimulation in a third, kinesthetic (movement-based sensory
experience) portion of their brains.
 Signing a word makes that word more concrete because the
child is not only hearing the word but also seeing the sign
for the word, seeing the object of the sign, and feeling the
movement of the sign. Repeatedly experiencing the sign will
eventually lead to a child’s responding to the sign through
obvious understanding or using the sign or word itself.
Chapter 1: Getting Onboard with Baby Signing 11
Speech delays and signing: 
They’re not related
My second daughter, Aidan Elizabeth, was diagnosed with a speech delay at 
22 months. Her doctor reluctantly wrote the referral for speech testing, telling 
me he was humoring me by doing so. The reason for his reluctance came from his
belief that speech-delayed children showed a symptom of frustration because they
couldn’t communicate, and he knew from discussions with me that Aidan Elizabeth
wasn’t frustrated because she could communicate with her family — through signs.
At the time, in fact, she knew around 125 signs. Aidan Elizabeth wasn’t frustrated —
because she had a means to communicate.
Now, her older sister, Darby, who was almost 3 years old at the time, knew around
175 signs and conversed with the maturity of a much older child. I mention this
because it turns out that one of the potential reasons for Aidan Elizabeth’s speech
delay was having a talkative older sister. The theory was that Aidan Elizabeth didn’t
need to talk because Darby talked for her.
Aidan Elizabeth qualified for speech therapy and has made significant strides in 
her speech development, but here’s the take-home point for you: She would’ve had
the speech delay whether we signed with her or not. Signing didn’t cause the
speech delay. In contrast, I hate to think about how frustrating her life would’ve
been without signs.

Even after I explain the benefits of signing with babies, some folks
worry that signing might delay their babies’ speech. Rest assured,
research has repeatedly proven that signing children actually begin
to speak earlier and speak more often than their non-signing coun-
terparts. According to Dr. Michelle Anthony and Dr. Reyna Lindert’s
research into signing babies, by 18 months of age, an average Signing
Smart child will have 94 signs and 105 spoken words. By stark con-
trast, a typical non-signing 18-month-old has 10 to 50 spoken words.
(Signing Smart [www.signingsmart.com] is a signing program for
hearing babies and toddlers that promotes ASL signs.)
Should I Use ASL or Make Up 
My Own Signs?
Know up front that either made-up signs or American Sign Language
(ASL) will achieve the goal of communicating more easily with your
baby until he can talk. In this book, though, I solely use ASL, so you
know where I stand.
Think of it this way. Your child says “wah-wah” and you know and
understand that he wants water. All of the experts tell you to sig-
nify your understanding but to continue to model the correct pro-
nunciation. My reason for preferring ASL signs over invented
gestures is the same. Besides, if I’m going to go to the trouble of fig-
uring out and passing on an additional language to my child, I think
I’ll invest in a real language — ASL. I mean, sure, Pig Latin is fun
and it communicates — but Latin it ain’t.
Part I: Talking Hands 
12
Use ASL and open all kinds of doors
When my oldest daughter, Darby, was 11 months old (and I was seven months preg-
nant with her sister), we went out to eat at a local restaurant. In the process of 
the meal, Darby signed MORE. Right away we heard an excited exclamation from
a hearing-impaired young man at the next table: “She signed MORE! She signed
MORE!”
He immediately came over and began signing and speaking to us. We clarified that
no one in our family was hearing impaired and we weren’t fluent in conversational
ASL, and then we shared with the young man our reasons for signing with our baby.
He was not only fascinated with the concept but also grateful to us for showing our
child how to communicate in his language.
By the way, you can find the sign for MORE, as well as other mealtime signs, in
Chapter 5.

When Should I Start and When
Will My Baby Start Signing Back?
In very general terms, it’s never too early to start signing with your
baby. Consider this: Do you wait until a baby can speak before you
speak to him? Of course not. You introduce words from the very
beginning — and you can do the same with signs.
That said, however, you have to be mindful of how many signs 
you introduce to your baby early on (see Chapter 2), and you can’t
expect a newborn to sign back. The younger you start signing to
your baby, the longer it’ll take for her to sign back. On the flipside,
if you start signing when the baby is older, she’ll probably respond
more quickly.
Like many milestones in babies’ lives, there’s simply no hard-and-
fast rule for knowing when your baby will start signing back. Each
child is different and responds to signing in different ways. And
each family is different and uses signing differently.
Turn to Chapter 2 for the nitty-gritty details on the right time to
introduce signs to your baby, where and how to begin, when your
baby might start signing back, and who else to bring onboard to
sign with your baby.
Many families keep from signing with their babies because they
think they’re too late. I can’t tell you how often I’ve heard, “Maybe
we’ll sign with the next baby.” Maybe so. The truth is, it’s never too
late to start signing with your children. They’ll benefit from the
experience regardless of their age.
When Should I Stop?
The decision to stop signing is very much an individual decision.
Know that continuing the journey past babyhood does provide
long-term benefits (see Chapter 13). I still sign with Darby, my
oldest, and she’s 4 years old. She still signs back to me. In fact, she
still asks me to show her new signs. She loves signing and finds it
fun and useful. For example, there are times when Darby gets a
little wound up and can’t seem to find the right words to communi-
cate. During those times, signing naturally takes over as she com-
municates through ASL instead of speech.
My whole family has terrific fun going about our lives and naturally
adding signing into our routines. Signing keeps the kids distracted
Chapter 1: Getting Onboard with Baby Signing 13

during a long wait at the doctor’s office, for example, as we play “I
Spy . . .” using color signs (see Appendix C). On rainy days when
we’re stuck inside, we sometimes learn new songs or read new sto-
ries, and we pick out a character or two to focus on and sign all the
way through. (Check out Chapter 16 for some great signing songs
and look in Chapter 7 for the sign for BOOK.) And I can even tell
my kids to “STOP!” across a crowded room or at the local park by
signing instead of screaming. (STOP and other safe-and-sound
signs are located in Chapter 6. Signs related to the great outdoors,
including the family park, are located in Chapter 10.)
In other words, signing shouldn’t be a chore. It should be fun and
not forced. That’s the way it is in my family, and we have no plans
to quit anytime soon.
What Should I Sign 
with My Baby?
Which words to sign is one of the most difficult decisions to make
when you’re just starting out signing with your baby. Because ASL
is an actual language, literally thousands of signs exist. Just buy an
ASL dictionary and you’ll see what I mean. Choosing your reper-
toire can be overwhelming, but a few simple guidelines can help
you decide which signs to use for your baby.
To begin, look around you. What is common to your world now
that baby is here? Start by signing a couple of the things that are
part of baby’s everyday life. Things like MILK (including formula)
and BATH are pretty consistent in baby’s day-to-day experience, so
those signs would probably work nicely. You probably also find
yourself frequently asking baby if he wants to EAT or DRINK or is
TIRED and ready for BED — all worthy signs, too.
There are likely also a few things that really get your baby excited,
like maybe the family DOG or the FISH in the aquarium at the
doctor’s office. Or maybe your baby is inseparable from her teddy
BEAR or BLANKET. Identify objects that your baby is really inter-
ested in (with my youngest, Cole, the fascinating object was a HAT
for a while), and you’ll start to build a useful and fun list of signs.
As you’re getting started, use this book as your guide for some
handy words to sign. Chapter 4, for example, focuses on some
basic signs that may be perfect for your baby. Or look through
Chapters 5 through 10, which provide signs in themed groups —
signs specifically for meals, safety, bath, bed, clothing, animals,
and the great outdoors. Or if you’re a just-gimme-the-top-ten kind
Part I: Talking Hands 
14

of person, turn to Chapter 15 for ten signs every baby or toddler
should know. And when you’re ready, Chapter 11 covers how to
sign some simple word “sentences.”
I’m Just Regular Folk — 
Can I Really Do This?
You may be overwhelmed by the thought of figuring out ASL,
remembering all those signs, and becoming a signing coach to your
baby. You’re not alone. Many who start down the path of signing
with their babies turn back because of worries over those very
things.
In fact, my own husband was reluctant when we began signing with
our first baby. He had studied Spanish in high school and college,
and Greek in college and graduate school. The experience was
enough to convince him that foreign languages are not his strong
suit. The thought of tackling another language, especially one as
unique as ASL, was a little scary for him.
But the point is not to learn an entire new language. You don’t have
to know all of ASL to sign with your baby. You only have to figure
out and become proficient with the individual signs that are of
value to you and your baby. And you only have to do so at a pace
that keeps you one step ahead of your baby’s learning curve. Even
my reluctant husband manages to do this and do it well. Seriously,
if you take the process a handful of signs at a time, you’ll be amazed
at how much you can remember. And you’ll be blown away at how
much, over time, your baby can remember, too.
As for the coaching part, some people seem to be born to teach.
There are at least eight school teachers in my immediate family,
and although I denied it for many years, I’m one of them. Maybe
you’re not born to teach, and that’s okay. You can still coach your
baby to communicate with sign language. In this book, I provide
you with tools to help make the task easier. Chapter 3, for example,
is kind of like a boot camp for getting in the right mindset and
“handset” (so to speak) as you prepare to sign with your baby. It
covers some basic hand shapes as well as some general do’s and
don’ts — tips and hints to help you along the way. In addition,
because a few signs encompass individual letters of the ASL alpha-
bet, I’ve included illustrations of the entire ASL alphabet in Appendix
A. Plus, every sign covered in this book is accompanied by step-by-
step directions and an illustration for making the sign. If you hit a
stumbling block, check out Chapter 12 for some guidance. And if
you’re so inclined, check out Chapter 17 for info about some outside
Chapter 1: Getting Onboard with Baby Signing 15

resources (Web sites, videos, and signing schools and courses) for
additional help.
But right here and now, I want you to check out how easy signing
can be. I want to show you how to make the sign for a very versa-
tile word — WHAT. You can simultaneously say and sign this word
in all sorts of conversations and situations. While you and baby are
looking at a storybook together, for example, you can point to an
object on a page and excitedly say and sign, “WHAT is that?!” Or if
baby is crying, you can wipe away the tears while gently saying
and signing, “WHAT is wrong?” Here you go:
1. Place your elbows to your sides, hands extended, 
palms up.
2. Shake your hands a bit in the natural gesture for “What?”
(see Figure 1-1).

 Finding out where and how to begin
 Understanding when baby might start signing back
 Calling in the troops to help reinforce the signs
S
o, you’ve decided to use sign language with your baby or tod-
dler. Great. Now what? You may be feeling overwhelmed and
don’t know when, where, or how to start. Well, relax. This chapter
helps you understand the right times, places, and situations to
introduce signs to your sweetie-peetie. In addition, it helps you
determine how many signs to start with; identify when your
sweetie-peetie might start signing back; and know why getting
family, friends, and caregivers involved is a big bonus.
Recognizing the Right Time 
to Introduce Signs
Whenever I talk to people about signing with babies, one of the first
questions I’m asked is, “When do I start to sign to my baby?” In my
mind, I reply, “When do you start to talk to your baby?” I only say
this in my mind, because if I said it out loud, people would probably
get up and leave. But seriously, think about this for a moment: Do
you wait until your baby can speak fluently before you speak to him?
I hope not. Why would signing with your baby be any different?
Some baby-signing programs do offer concrete suggestions such 
as, “You should begin to sign with your baby at x months of age,” or,
“You should begin to sign with baby when baby does x.” However,

different programs seem to insert different data for the x. In my
experience that can be confusing for a parent, and I don’t care to
add to the confusion.
Typically, when other programs offer an age or other indicator to
begin signing, they’re focusing on a general point at which a baby
is developing the necessary cognitive and/or physical skills to sign
back. (By the way, as I write these words, I have a baby sleeping
down the hall who completely blew all of that general data out of
the water when he began signing at 4 months old.) Again I ask, 
“Do you wait until baby can speak before you speak to baby?” Of
course not. Then why should you wait until baby can sign before
you sign to baby?
I do feel I should tell you this: The sooner you start teaching baby
to sign, the longer you may have to wait for baby to sign back.
What I mean is that your baby will not be physically or mentally
able to sign for a little while. Again, this is what other programs
refer to when they offer specific ages or milestones to look for.
These markers are real, even if the experts can’t all agree on what
they are. At the same time I feel I should tell you this as well: My
son Cole, at 18 months, has a sign vocabulary of 102 signs. I know
in my heart that that number is as high as it is because he’s been
surrounded by two parents, two siblings, and a variety of care-
givers who have been signing to him since birth.
The better question is not when, but how to teach baby to sign. I
hope you find the answer to the second, much more important ques-
tion in this book, even if, like most parents, you came looking for the
answer to the first. In a nutshell, here’s how to teach baby to sign:
 Focus on a handful of pertinent signs.
 Introduce and reinforce those signs at the right times.
 Be consistent.
This book is about discovering how to do those three things — and
how to have fun doing them.
Knowing Where to Begin
“So should I start signing every time I say a particular word?
Should I only sign at mealtime? Should I make my baby look at me
when I sign? Where should I begin?”
All are valid questions, and this section provides the basic answers.
Part I: Talking Hands 
18

Focus
Many parents in my classes want to begin by signing every word
they say to their babies. They find out quickly how many signs they
must learn to keep up with their spoken language, and then they
become burned out in less than a month because their little dar-
ling isn’t signing back.
“Why isn’t she signing back?” they ask.
“Maybe because you’re overwhelming her with too many signs,” 
I say.
Think for a minute about how babies learn to talk. They don’t talk
in full sentences at first, or even for years. Instead, they start small,
with individual words like “da-da” or “ma-ma” or “ba” (which could
mean “ball,” “bath,” or “bird” depending on the context). And that’s
exactly how you should begin when signing to your baby. Start small.
Pick a handful of signs — say, four or five — to start with. Make
sure the signs are of things your baby is interested in and/or that
she needs on a daily basis. Watch for items of interest to sign for
her. Is her interest in the family dog? The wind? A bus? Books?
Take your cue from her. What is part of her daily routine? Milk?
Eating? Sleeping? Again, take your cue from her.
Does your family have a dog? A cat? A tank full of fish? Do you ride
in the car a lot? Does big sister dance? Big brother play basketball?
Daddy play softball? Check out the areas of life that your family is
interested and active in, and consider making a handful of those
signs your starter repertoire.
If you absolutely have no idea which signs to start with, check out
Chapter 4. It covers some handy basic signs, like HELLO, BYE-BYE,
MAMA, and DADA.
Look for the right time
The time to introduce the sign for APPLE isn’t while your baby is
taking a bath. Save APPLE for a mealtime at the kitchen table. But
don’t follow it with BICYCLE, thinking that, while you’ve got her
attention during mealtime, you might as well introduce what
schnookums will see during her afternoon outing at the park.
Instead, stick with signs like EAT, MORE, DRINK, FINISHED, and
whatever food you’re serving (see Chapter 5 for details). Strained
CARROTS, anyone?
Chapter 2: Introducing Signs to Your Baby 19

Likewise, more appropriate signs for bath time are BATH, DUCK (but
only if you have a rubber one floating around), WATER, SPLASH,
BUBBLES . . . you get the idea. (Chapter 7 provides details on bath-
time signs.)
In other words — and this is the all-important take-home point
here — remember to sign whatever is appropriate in the situation
you’re in at that particular moment in time. And just focus on one
or two signs. Don’t overload.
Consistency counts
Know this tidbit up front: Repetition is important. If you want your
little buddy to get it — to actually make the connection and under-
stand, for example, that the hand motion you make whenever the
family dog walks into the room means DOG — you need to sign the
word over and over again in context. So if you want to introduce
the sign for DOG, then watch for the family pooch to walk into the
room, catch your little buddy’s attention and say and sign DOG.
And do it with great gusto. If you’re excited about signing, then
he’ll be excited about signing. As you make the sign, say the word
loudly or softly or in a silly voice. Whatever it takes to get his
attention.
Think about how you try to get your dumpling to smile for a por-
trait and how crazy the photographer talks in an attempt to get a
single smile from your child. You and the photographer talk loudly
or softly or in a silly voice, don’t you? You use your baby voice.
Adults tend to use a different voice, their baby voice, when speak-
ing to infants or toddlers. And kids seem to love it. So while you’re
signing, apply that same baby voice to get and hold your
dumpling’s attention.
The sign for DOG, by the way, is in Chapter 9, as are lots of other
animal signs. Animals are a gold-mine, high-interest area for kids.
Keep that in mind.
Knowing When Baby 
Might Sign Back
Look for it: The slightest movement of your sweetie’s hands can be
a sign (pun intended) that she’s trying to sign back. Know up front
what you’re actually looking for, though — you won’t see an exact
replica of what your sign looks like. A sign on her little hands won’t
Part I: Talking Hands 
20

look like a sign on your hands. Her tiny size and yet-to-be-developed
motor skills will affect her motions.
If you’ve been signing BALL with your baby, and she moves her
hands a bit while looking at a BALL, get excited, praise her, and
reinforce the movement by saying, “You signed BALL! Are you
ready to play with your BALL?” Be sure to continue signing BALL
every time you say it during your praise session. She’ll eventually
begin to understand that when she moves her hands, it means
something.
The younger your baby is when you start signing to her, the longer
it will take for her to sign back. Consequently, when you start sign-
ing with an older baby, she’ll probably respond very quickly.
Making Signing a Family Affair
Signing together as a family is big fun, if I do say so myself. My hus-
band and I have three children. Darby is 4, Aidan Elizabeth is 3,
and Cole is 18 months — not necessarily what we planned, but
what we joyfully have in our home. And we all participate in sign-
ing together.
Recently, for example, while my husband was at a meeting, the
girls and I signed through almost an entire meal, with few words
spoken. Cole watched and occasionally jumped in with a random
sign or a delighted squeal. They’ve been signing as long as they
can remember and have helped teach each other, as well as friends
outside the family.
We have video of the girls teaching Cole to sign when he was just
weeks old. They’re also constantly teaching signs to their baby
dolls and stuffed animals. At 18 months, Cole knows 102 signs and
119 spoken words. Keep that nugget in context, though. Remember:
Cole has had four people signing with him since the day he was
born. The girls know around 300 signs now and are always asking
for more signs.
I believe that signing together forces a family to pay better atten-
tion to each other. And, in my humble opinion, it makes you a
better parent. If you’re constantly watching your child for signs
and paying attention to what she’s interested in, you learn to read
her body signals in addition to her signs. And when you’re picking
up a particular toy and showing her the sign for it, you’re showing
her that you’re interested in her and that you care about what
she’s playing with.
Chapter 2: Introducing Signs to Your Baby 21

Remembering That Caregivers 
and Friends Are Family, Too
I have a wonderful teenage babysitter named Abby who comes
over at least twice a week to help out with the kids (and give mom
a break). At one point, Abby showed me a couple of signs and
asked if they were correct. I said yep, and she was blown away
because my girls, Darby and Aidan Elizabeth, taught those signs to
her. Now Abby teaches signs to her friends during lunch.
That’s all fine and dandy in itself, but hindsight has shown me this
to boot: If you have a babysitter, day-care provider, or friend your
sugar pie sees on a regular basis, let him know upfront that you’re
using sign language with your baby and show him the signs you’re
working on with your baby. This is especially important if your
baby has begun to sign back and will expect any caregiver to know
what she’s talking and signing about.
Here’s a case in point: One time my mom and grandmother were
taking care of the girls for a few hours, and I hadn’t shown them all
the signs the kids might use. Well, at one point Aidan Elizabeth
stood outside the pantry and made a sign. My mom and grandma
knew she was signing, but they had absolutely no idea what she
was signing, so they asked Darby to interpret. Because our kitchen’s
trash can is in the pantry, Darby decided that Aidan Elizabeth was
signing DIRTY and that meant trash, so Darby told her DeeDee and
Great-Memaw that Aidan Elizabeth had something to throw away.
Aidan Elizabeth wasn’t even 2 yet, and Darby wasn’t yet 3. Later,
Darby decided Aidan Elizabeth hadn’t been signing for the trash
can but had been signing COOKIE, and could they both please have
one? Smart little cookie, that Darby.

 Discovering a few hand shapes commonly used in various signs
 Identifying a few rules to get you effectively on your way
M
any different American Sign Language (ASL) signs share
something in common: specific hand shapes. In other
words, many signs incorporate the same hand shapes as many
other signs. But where you place the common hand shape and
what you do with it next is the key to making signs mean different
things.
This chapter covers a few of the hand shapes that are commonly
used in various different signs. If you get a handle on these hand
shapes upfront, you’re a bit ahead of the game with various
signs. Note, too, that although knowing the ASL alphabet or ASL
numbers isn’t essential to signing with babies, many ASL hand
shapes are based on individual letters or numbers, so I’ve placed
the ASL alphabet in Appendix A and numbers one through ten in
Appendix B.
Also important up front is having the right mindset as you pre-
pare to sign with your baby. So, in this chapter, I pass on some
of my tips of the trade — some do’s and don’ts for you to soak up
for success.

Hand Shapes: Not Just for 
Shadow Puppets Anymore
Remember the days when someone shined a flashlight on the wall
in a dark room and you moved your hands to make a duck or a dog
or a butterfly in the shadows? The shape you made with your hands
was important in creating those shadow puppets. The shape of
your hands is also important in creating ASL signs. This section
covers a few basic hand shapes that you’ll use again and again
while creating various signs.
Open-5
The open-5 hand shape is pretty straightforward. Simply hold up
your hand, palm away from you, with all five fingers extended and
spread apart (see Figure 3-1). As easy as making a quacking duck
shadow puppet on the wall, eh?
Figure 3-1: Give me five — an open-5!
Closed-5
The closed-5 hand shape is as simple as the open-5. Just hold up
your hand, palm facing away from you, with all five fingers
extended and touching each other (see Figure 3-2). Think of the
hand shape used for the beauty-queen wave.

Figure 3-2: The closed-5 hand shape. Think “Here she is . . . Miss America!”
Claw-C
I know, claw sounds like a bad horror movie. I don’t name the hand
shapes, okay? I only show them.
To make the claw-C hand shape, follow these directions:
1. Begin by making the open-5 hand shape (see the direc-
tions earlier in this chapter).
Note that the open-5 hand shape is also the ASL number
five (see Appendix B).
2. Now slightly bend all five fingers (see Figure 3-3).
Looks like a claw, doesn’t it? So, yes, it sounds like a bad
horror movie, but the name makes sense after all.
Note: Some signers refer to the claw-C hand shape as just a C hand
shape. Just one of those toma¯to/tomäto things. The sign’s the same
no matter what you call it.
Chapter 3: Warming Up: Signing Boot Camp 25

Figure 3-3: Coming to a theater near you: Return of the Claw.
Claw-5
You’re probably wondering what happened to claw-2, claw-3, and
claw-4. I’ll leave that research to you, because they’re not pertinent
to this book. Regardless, as you may have guessed, this hand
shape is similar to the claw-C. Note: Some ASL signers call this a
bent-5. Toma¯to/tomäto again . . . it’s the same sign either way.
Here’s how to make the sign:
1. Begin by making the open-5 hand shape (see the direc-
tions earlier in this chapter).
2. Without moving your thumb, slightly bend the other four
fingers (see Figure 3-4).
With the regular ol’ claw-C hand shape, you bend your
thumb along with your fingers. But with the claw-5 hand
shape, your thumb stays extended — not bent.
Part I: Talking Hands 
26

Figure 3-4: Beware claw-5.
Flat-F
Musically speaking, an F flat is an E. Not so in the world of ASL. In
this world, a flat-F is a hand shape, and you make it by following
these simple steps:
1. Begin by making the open-5 hand shape (see the direc-
tions earlier in this chapter).
2. While holding that position, make an O with your index
finger and thumb.
At this point, you’ve actually made an ASL letter F (see
Appendix A).
3. Extend (straighten) your index finger and thumb only.
As you do so, the circle made by these two fingers in the
letter F is flattened (see Figure 3-5).
Chapter 3: Warming Up: Signing Boot Camp 27

Part I: Talking Hands 
28
Figure 3-5: The flat-F hand shape.
Flat-O
Nope, no musical pun comes to mind for this flat hand shape. So
I’ll get right to the directions:
1. Begin by making the closed-5 hand shape (see the direc-
tions earlier in this chapter).
2. While they’re still touching, bend all four fingers and
form an O with your index finger and thumb.
At this point, you’ve actually made an ASL letter O (see
Appendix A).
3. Extend (straighten) all of your fingers and thumb, flatten-
ing the circle of your O (see Figure 3-6).
This hand shape also doubles as a hand puppet with its
mouth closed.
Bent-3
We’re back to number hand shapes. This one’s pretty easy. Here
are the directions for the bent-3 hand shape:
1. Make an ASL three by extending your index finger,
middle finger, and thumb (see Appendix B).
2. Bend in your two fingers and thumb a bit to make the
bent-3 (see Figure 3-7).

Figure 3-6: The flat-O hand shape.
Figure 3-7: The bent-3 hand shape.
Some Signing Do’s and Don’ts
As you prepare to sign with your baby, you need to do more than
just figure out how to make and show your baby the signs them-
selves. You also need to get yourself in the right frame of mind, and
the best way to do so is to know and follow some basic rules. Yes,
Chapter 3: Warming Up: Signing Boot Camp 29

in every arena of life there are rules, things you do and things you
don’t do. Signing with baby is no exception. In no way does this
section encompass all the rules for signing with baby, but it does
give you a good set to start with.
Do stick with it
Rome wasn’t built in a day. Your baby took nine months to get
here. Coaching your baby to sign takes time. And keep in mind that
each baby develops the ability to sign back at her own individual
pace, just as with other aspects of development (like walking,
crawling, talking, and such). I can’t tell you when your baby will
sign back to you. What I can tell you is that the more consistently
you sign with her, the more likely you are to get results.
You may get frustrated and begin to wonder if your baby will ever
sign back. If you stick with it, the day will come. That said, the
younger your baby is when you start signing to her, the longer
you’ll probably have to wait for her first sign back. However, the
time you spend signing won’t be in vain. She’ll understand you
before she begins to sign back. And when she does begin to sign
back, she’ll have a strong foundation already instilled in her. So
keep telling yourself, “I’m investing in my baby.” And there’s no
better way to invest.
Do get others involved
Who sees baby on a regular basis? Is it a babysitter, a day-care
provider, a grandparent, siblings? Those people need to know
which signs you’re using with baby and which signs he’s signing
back. Consistency is vital as you’re coaching baby to sign, and if
baby’s other caregivers are willing to pick up the ball when you
aren’t around, that’s just all the more exposure for baby.
Now many caregivers may choose not to sign with baby due to
time constraints or disinterest. Giving them the information is still
important, especially when baby begins to sign back. Babies feel
frustrated when they’re communicating and no one seems to be lis-
tening. Recognizing your baby’s signs will only make his caregivers’
jobs easier. Besides, when they realize that signing works, many
caregivers become interested and want to sign with baby as well.
All is not lost if your baby’s caregivers ultimately choose not to
sign with him. Your influence on him is far greater than anyone
else’s. If you commit to signing with baby, regardless of what
anyone else does or doesn’t do, baby will reap the benefits for
years to come.

Do look for teachable moments
Teachable moments are those times when baby is most receptive
to what you’re trying to coach her on. For example, you wouldn’t
try to coach her on the sign for EAT (see Chapter 5) while baby’s in
the bathtub. Well, I guess you could be telling her not to EAT the
soap, but that’s another story. The point is, in order to make the
most of the time you invest in coaching baby to sign, be on the
lookout for the most opportune settings to do it in.
For example, suppose that you walk into the room to find baby’s
nose glued to the window. Upon further investigation, you realize
she’s fascinated by a bird she has discovered on the branch just
outside. This is the perfect time to focus on the sign for BIRD (see
Chapter 9). “Do you see that BIRD? Isn’t that a pretty BIRD? What
does the BIRD say? Chirp, chirp, chirp!”
So be on the lookout. When baby is interested in an object, that’s
the best time to show her the sign for it. If you don’t happen to
know the sign for that particular object, use the sign WHAT, found
in Chapter 1.
Do continue signing 
after baby speaks
One of my greatest frustrations comes when parents stop signing
with their baby simply because baby has started to speak. I’m also
saddened when parents comment, “That’s so cool. I wish I had
signed with my kids. Now it’s too late.” These parents usually have
kids who are around age 2. Usually my response is, “You still have
time. Want to come to one of my classes?”
The benefits of coaching your child to sign don’t disappear simply
because he can suddenly express himself with words. True, signing
bridges a communication gap with your baby while he’s too young
to speak and helps you understand what he’s thinking and feeling.
But your quest to know what’s going on in his mind doesn’t stop
the minute he begins to speak, and many times children can find a
way to express themselves through signs in ways they can’t
through words.
Do have fun
If you’re not having fun, chances are your baby isn’t having fun
either. Signing with baby is about communicating with her, show-
ing her that you care about her thoughts and needs, and reducing
Chapter 3: Warming Up: Signing Boot Camp 31

the stress and frustration that baby’s inability to communicate 
can lead to. These are all good things, and you ought to enjoy the
process.
Ever heard the saying “If it’s not fun, it’s not worth doing”? That’s
truly the case for signing with your baby. If you’re not enjoying it,
here’s what to do: Take a step back, take a deep breath, and reread
this chapter’s list of do’s and don’ts to make sure you’re following
them, especially the next one, “Don’t overwhelm baby.” Nine times
out of ten, if you’re frustrated trying to coach baby to sign and
seeing no results, the reason is because your baby is overwhelmed
by too many signs.
Don’t overwhelm baby
This is probably the most common mistake I’ve seen parents make
when they’re coaching their baby to sign. They find a book like this
one, get to know all the signs as fast as they can, and try to use
them with baby all at once. Baby can’t get to know these signs as
quickly as you can, and if you give your baby more than he can
handle, he’ll likely tune out.
So how much is too much? A good guideline, at least as you’re 
getting started, is to focus on five or six signs. Be choosey when
you pick these signs. They should be things that are a big part of
baby’s life, including things that baby really needs, like MILK (see
Chapter 5), as well as things that baby really loves, like his favorite
BALL (see Chapter 10).
When baby begins to sign one of these five or six initial signs, you
can add a new one. So, theoretically, at any given time you should
only be working with the signs baby already knows and can sign,
plus five or six that you’re trying to coach him on.
By the way, this approach also means you don’t have to feel over-
whelmed. You really don’t have to get proficient with every sign in
ASL or even every sign in this book right away. You just have to
keep pace with baby. Trust me, you can do it.
Don’t expect perfection
You don’t expect perfection from baby when it comes to oral com-
munication, right? In other words, you don’t sit around expecting
her to say “mommy” or “daddy” with perfect diction the first time
she speaks. In fact, the first time one of her gurgles even comes
close to sounding like “ma-ma” or “da-da” you’re jumping for joy,
pulling out the memory book, and calling all the grandparents.
Part I: Talking Hands 
32

So have the same realistic expectations with baby and signing. The
first time your baby signs MILK (see Chapter 5), she probably won’t
get it just right. In fact, it may be quite a while before she does.
That’s okay. The goal when signing with baby is communication. If
you know what baby is trying to sign, if you understand the need or
desire she’s trying to express, then you’ve achieved this goal.
Keep in mind that it’s not so important to correct baby when her
signs are not just so, but it is important to continue modeling
proper sign technique. Consider this example from oral communi-
cation: Baby may call water “wa-wa,” but you know she means
water. You let her know you understand her, but you continue to
say “water,” and eventually she says “water” too. Do the same
thing with signing: When you realize that your baby is trying to
communicate a sign back to you (and believe me, you’ll know),
don’t get caught up in whether or not she does it just right.
Applaud baby’s attempts. Encourage her by letting her know that
you understand her. Don’t worry about correcting her. But con-
tinue to model the sign properly. The rest will take care of itself.
Don’t be surprised when 
baby takes off
Coaching baby to sign takes time. It may seem like it’s taking for-
ever for him to sign back for the first time. It may feel that way
again before the next sign comes. But take heart; it won’t always 
be this way.
I have a cousin who diligently worked with his baby to walk. He
and his wife held her hands and guided her, encouraging her to
take a few steps back and forth between them — you know the 
routine. Then one day, when my cousin picked up his little one
from day care, her caregivers reported, “She’s been walking all
day.” She hasn’t crawled since.
The same thing will happen when you work with your baby to sign.
The first few signs will come at a snail’s pace. Then one day he’ll
suddenly begin signing back every sign you’ve been trying to
coach him on. For a little while, you’ll even have to work hard to
figure out new signs fast enough to show him. Then the pace will
slow down. Then it’ll take off again. Coaching baby to sign will be
filled with stops and starts, slow periods and fast ones. Just
remember, if you want him to take off, if you want to make it to one
of those fast-paced stages (and you do want to make it there), you
have to remain diligent during the slow times.
Chapter 3: Warming Up: Signing Boot Camp 33

Don’t listen to the skeptics
Life is full of skeptics — the glass-is-half-empty crowd. As you
begin to sign with your baby, the skeptics will come out of the
woodwork. They may be your in-laws or even your own parents.
They may be your best friends or complete strangers. The skeptic
may even be your spouse. All those skeptics will roll their eyes.
They’ll say you’re crazy. They’ll warn you that your baby will never
learn to speak.
The skeptics will be wrong. Let them roll their eyes. It’s not crazy
to want to communicate with your baby as soon as possible. It’s
not crazy to want to reduce the stress in your baby’s life. And
know that not only will your baby learn to speak, but he’ll also
probably be a step ahead of his non-signing peers (see Chapter 1).
You’re a hero. You’re doing the right thing for your baby. Don’t let
anyone tell you otherwise.

Part II
Ready, Set, Sign!

In this part . . .
You’ve made the decision to sign with your baby, so
you’ve assumed the ready, set position. Thing is,
you’re stuck at the starting line because you have no idea
what to sign, let alone where to do it and how to make the
signs themselves.
Well, fret not. Part II offers you some great starting places.
Here, you ﬁnd some basic signs, signs for mealtime, safety
signs, and signs for bed and bath. These signs pertain to
the daily necessities of baby’s life. Because of the nearly
constant day-to-day repetition of the activities related to
these signs, one of them may very well become the ﬁrst
one that your baby signs back.
As an added bonus, all the signs in this part directly help
you communicate with baby about his care and well-being.
And don’t even worry about how to make these signs.
Every sign presented in this book comes with detailed,
illustrated, step-by-step instructions. You’ll be signing right
away — and baby will be signing along before you know it!

I
n our busy lives, coming and going are continuous actions for
all of us, including babies and toddlers. Most little ones are con-
stantly telling one caregiver good-bye and another hello as their
parents rush off to work or the gym or wherever. But no matter
where junior is at the moment, he usually has the same people and
everyday things on his mind. Those people are his family, and
those everyday things are getting his diaper changed, getting used
to going to the potty, and getting his cup filled.
In this chapter, I cover some signs you and your little one can use as
you drop him off, pick him up, and meet folks out in the world. I also
cover some signs that communicate who’s who in the family and
what’s what in the business of diapers, potties, and cups. In other
words, I explain a few basic signs that any caregiver can use with
your baby throughout the day, night, or weekend (oh, to be so lucky).
Meeting and Greeting: You Say
Good-Bye, and I Say Hello . . .
Babies and toddlers are constantly attempting to connect with
others around them, whether it’s mom, a friend, or a stranger in
the grocery store. You can use the signs in this section to help
junior, you, and whoever else know what he’s really saying. After
all, a parent does need to monitor these things.

Hello
Well, you get lucky on the sign for HELLO. Much of American Sign
Language (ASL) is made up of natural gestures we already know
and love. HELLO is a great example of natural-gesture-turned-ASL.
Be sure to introduce the sign HELLO in a natural context and set-
ting, like when you’re at the grocery store and your munchkin
notices a smiley lady in the cereal aisle. Catch your munchkin’s eye
and say, “See the nice lady? Let’s say HELLO,” and then make the
sign like this:
1. Make an ASL B by holding your four fingers straight up
and laying your thumb across your palm.
You can find the ASL alphabet in Appendix A.
2. While still holding your fingers in the B shape, place your
index finger at your temple.
3. Move your hand out as if you’re a soldier saluting some-
one (see Figure 4-1).
See? Signing isn’t as difficult as you thought.
Figure 4-1: HELLO, friend.
Always reinforce a sign by repeating yourself as often as possible
after first introducing it. In the case of HELLO, for example, after
first introducing the sign, wait a minute and then do it again. If
you’re in the grocery store and you just said HELLO to a nice lady
in the cereal aisle, move on to the next aisle, catch your child’s eye
a second time, say “Let’s say HELLO again!” and make the sign very
excitedly to the next smiley person you see.
Part II: Ready, Set, Sign!

Bye-bye
Is there anything cuter than a baby waving bye-bye? Not much.
And as luck would have it, the sign for BYE-BYE is the same natural
gesture we all know and love. So whether you and your baby are
saying good-bye to Dad, the babysitter, or the smiley lady in the
cereal aisle, mention to munchkin what’s going on — “BYE-BYE,
nice lady in the cereal aisle!” — while simultaneously making the
following sign:
1. Place your hand parallel to your body, fingertips point-
ing up.
2. As a whole, move your fingers down and up (see 
Figure 4-2).
Figure 4-2: Buh-bye.
That’s it. You’ve just signed BYE-BYE. You already knew some ASL —
you just didn’t know you knew it!
I love you
Seeing your baby sign I LOVE YOU is heart melting. I should know:
The “I love you, Mommy” sidebar in this chapter is about my own
son signing I LOVE YOU.
This sign is a combination of the ASL letters I, L, and Y. (To find
more on the ASL alphabet, turn to Appendix A.)
Chapter 4: Signing 101: Some Basic Signs 39

Say and sign I LOVE YOU with your baby — aw shucks, with every-
one in your family — as often as possible. Here are the magic steps
to melting hearts:
1. Put your little finger up, with the rest of your fingers 
in a fist.
2. Put your index finger up, too.
3. While your little finger and index fingers are still up,
move your thumb out (see Figure 4-3).
Been to a heavy-metal concert lately? Probably not, being
that baby now has a monopoly over your nights and week-
ends and, well, your social life in general. But I digress. If
you’ve ever been to a heavy-metal concert, yep, this is the
exact same sign rock stars use during their power ballads
to profess their love to their fans.

I love you, Mommy
When my son Cole was 10 months old, I was putting him down for a nap one day.
As I was laying him down, I said and signed, “I LOVE YOU, Cole.” To my utmost sur-
prise, he shook his little hand back and forth in an attempt of I LOVE YOU and then
signed MOMMY. Needless to say, I had tears in my eyes as I tiptoed out of his room.
No doubt he’ll be a heartbreaker someday (grin and sigh).

Thank you
All parents want their kids to be polite, and the sooner you begin
teaching yours to say THANK YOU, the better. Being too young to
talk is no excuse for bad manners, which is why the sign THANK
YOU comes in handy.
Say that little dumpling has let you know one way or another that
she’d like her teddy bear. You plop down on your knees beside her
bed, lift the quilt that’s dragging the floor, and find the bear along-
side yesterday’s bunched-up socks. As you hand the bear to her, be
sure to ask her to say THANK YOU for your efforts and show her
how with this sign:
1. Place the tips of your fingers on your chin.
2. In one gesture, move your hand down with your finger-
tips pointing away from your chin (see Figure 4-4).
Figure 4-4: THANK YOU!

Who Are You Again?
Parents are always anxious for their children to say their first
word. But one of parenting’s many ironies is that in a few years,
those same parents are always longing, instead, for their children
to puh-leez be quiet. But that’s off the point du jour.
The point is that two of the first words children usually speak are
mama and dada. So why not give them a head start by using the
signs for those words? In this section, I show you how to make
those signs, as well as the signs for a few other special people in
your child’s life.
Mama
Seeing their babies sign MAMA for the very first time makes grown
women grin and sends a shot of love right through their hearts.
You moms out there will definitely want to experience this feeling,
so frequently introduce yourself to your baby while simultaneously
making this sign:
1. Spread your fingers like you’ve just counted to five.
2. While still holding your five fingers up, place your thumb
on your chin (see Figure 4-5).
Figure 4-5: Hi there, MAMA!
Part II: Ready, Set, Sign! 
42

Note that the MAMA sign works for Mama, Mommy, Mom, Mother,
or whatever term you use for the maternal unit of the family.
Dada
Although seeing your child sign MAMA for the first time is heart-
warming, seeing your child sign DADA can actually draw tears.
Trust me. I’ve seen it with my own eyes. You dads out there will
definitely want some of this for yourself, so frequently introduce
yourself to your baby while simultaneously making this sign:
1. Spread your fingers like you’ve just counted to five.
2. While still holding your five fingers up, place your thumb
on your forehead (see Figure 4-6).
Figure 4-6: DADA!
Note that the DADA sign works for Dada, Daddy, Dad, Father, or
whatever term you use for the paternal unit of the family.
Baby
One of the neat things about using sign language is that, after your
child learns the sign for a word, she can sometimes use it in a
totally different context. Take BABY, for example. When your baby
gets a handle on signing BABY to refer to herself, she can also use
Chapter 4: Signing 101: Some Basic Signs 43

the sign to let you know that she sees someone else’s baby at, say,
the day-care center or even that she wants her baby doll. Same
word, same sign, different uses.
So whenever the situation applies, say and sign BABY to let your
sweetie know that she can use the sign in many scenarios. Here’s
how to sign the word:
1. Cradle your arms at waist level.
2. Rock them back and forth (see Figure 4-7).
Figure 4-7: Who’s your BABY?
Grandma
Whether you call her Grandma, Granny, Memaw, DeeDee, or Nana,
she’s probably an important part of your child’s life. That’s as good
a reason as any to include the sign for her in your child’s reper-
toire. The term you use is totally up to you, but always follow it
with this sign:
1. Make the sign for MAMA (see the “Mama” section).
2. Move your hand out and down, stopping for a short time
at 90 degrees and 180 degrees (see Figure 4-8).
Part II: Ready, Set, Sign!

Figure 4-8: Please, GRANDMA?
Now go call your mother or mother-in-law and tell her you’re
teaching your baby to sign GRANDMA. You’ll be a big hit, and the
entire family will be focused on your signing baby at the next
family gathering.
Grandpa
As if GRANDPA needed another thing to be proud of, watching his
grandkid use the sign for GRANDPA is totally endearing. Here’s how
to make this sign, which applies no matter whether you call him
Grandpa, Gramps, Papaw, Pappy, or even Pampu:
1. Make the sign for DADA (see the “Dada” section).
2. Move your hand out and down, stopping for a short time
at 90 degrees and 180 degrees (see Figure 4-9).

A Few Everyday Needs
I hear ya: Signs for family members are cute and everything, but
what about signs to help make your life easier (like reduce scream-
ing fits, for example)? Yep, those kinds of signs do exist, and I’m
here to please.
Your baby or toddler probably has a few things on his mind regu-
larly, like what’s in his diaper, or whether the feeling he’s experi-
encing means he needs to go visit the potty, or where his cup is at
the moment (and whether he can get it filled). The three simple
signs in this section relate to those things and will get you and
your baby on the right track with two-way communication beyond
“waaaaaah!” Good luck.
Diaper
One of the things babies often fuss about is the condition of their
diapers. How fantastic would it be to have your baby sign DIAPER
before she starts screaming? It is possible, my friend, so regularly
Part II: Ready, Set, Sign! 
46

talk with your child about the condition of her diaper while simul-
taneously signing the magic word like this:
1. Make an L with both hands by pointing your index fin-
gers up and holding your thumbs out to the side.
To see the entire ASL alphabet, turn to Appendix A.
2. On both hands, close your index finger and thumb
together.
3. Place your hands near the top of where a diaper would
be, around the waist area.
4. Open and close your fingers and thumbs two or three
times (see Figure 4-10).
Figure 4-10: Change my DIAPER, please.
Potty
Signing for a DIAPER change is a wonderful thing, but signing for the
POTTY is even better. Just think, no more diapers to clean up. . . .
Pardon me, I lost myself for a second, dreaming of that glorious day.
Chapter 4: Signing 101: Some Basic Signs 47

Note that if your baby is too young to use the potty yet, you can
always introduce the sign anyway, just so baby can hear the word
and see the sign regularly. And if baby has a big brother, regularly
say and sign POTTY with big brother while in the baby’s presence
to keep driving home the point of the potty. In other words, in this
particular case it’s okay to have a potty mouth. Say and sign
POTTY all the time. The payoff down the road is huge.
Here’s how to walk the walk and sign the sign:
1. Make a fist.
2. While your hand is still in a fist, make an ASL letter T
by placing your thumb between your index and middle
fingers.
You can check out the entire ASL alphabet in Appendix A.
3. Shake your hand back and forth a few times (see 
Figure 4-11).
Figure 4-11: Time to go POTTY.
Cup
CUP is one of those handy multipurpose signs — useful for all
types of cup situations. The CUP sign will come in handy during
your little one’s transition from baby bottle to big-boy cup. And the
same CUP sign can be used for communication when your little
one is trying to get into Mommy or Daddy’s cup. Additionally, your
Part II: Ready, Set, Sign! 
48

baby can use the CUP sign to actually tell you when he’s thirsty
and wants his cup. (You can find signs for things to go in cups in
Chapter 5.)
1. Form the ASL letter C by rounding your fingers and
thumb.
In other words, make an O with your fingers and thumb and
then open up a little space between them. (See Appendix A
for the whole ASL alphabet.)
2. Place your C hand on your opposite hand’s open palm
(see Figure 4-12).

Eat, Baby, Eat! 
Mealtime Signs
In This Chapter
 Using signs at mealtime
 Introducing different food signs to your baby
I
deally, having the entire family sit down together for dinner can
be a delightful end to a busy day. But in reality, it can be more a
source of major frustration than relaxation. Mealtime can become
crazy-baby time, with food flying, cups spilling, and mouths intensely
screaming — on both your and little darling’s part. And then there’s
the mess to deal with afterwards.
This chapter provides the info you need to show that sweet baby
how to sign what she wants or needs instead of covering your face
with mushed carrots. I mean, granted, it’s great that she has a strong
opinion, but why not let her express it in the toy room instead of the
highchair? At the very least, the outcome will be easier to clean up.
Magic Signs for Mealtime
The best time to introduce signs related to mealtime is while you’re
sitting at the table during a regular, routine meal. Don’t set up a
formal lesson or formal setting for the occasion. Just be casual and
introduce the signs naturally in the course of your standard conver-
sation with baby.
In this section, I cover four signs for communicating words that are
common during mealtime.

Eat
So you’re sitting on your last nerve in the playroom while Mighty
Lungs is screaming at the top of his lungs beside you. You simply
can’t figure out what he wants. He swats away his teddy bear and
favorite toys when you offer them up. He’s not sitting in a poopy
diaper. He’s not cold and doesn’t have a boo-boo. What? What?
You notice that he stops his waaaahs as he spots a Cheerio on the
floor. Before you can intervene, he picks it up and pops it in his
mouth. Momentary bliss and enchantment ensue as he looks around
for more yummy floor nuggets, but upon finding none, he starts
screaming again. Duh. You realize that he’s probably hungry, so
you scoop him up and head straight to the kitchen for a snack.
There’s an easier way — trust me. The sign for EAT will help your
baby tell you when he wants to eat so that you won’t have to deci-
pher screaming. The sign is simple to make, like this:
1. Make a flat-O hand shape by first forming an O with your
fingers and thumb and then flattening them out so that
they look like a deflated balloon.
You can find the ASL alphabet in Appendix A.
2. Touch your fingertips to your mouth repeatedly (see
Figure 5-1).
Figure 5-1: I’m ready to EAT, mama dear.
Part II: Ready, Set, Sign! 
52

As you’re first introducing a new sign to your baby, repeat it often.
For example, use the sign for EAT any time you’re talking to your
baby about food, and specifically sign EAT every time you say the
word: “Are you hungry? Do you want to EAT?”, “Would you like 
to EAT some bananas?”, or “Mommy is EATing, do you want to 
EAT, too?”
Drink
No matter what her preference — milk, juice, or water — when 
she wants her DRINK, she wants it now. (Ask me how I know this.)
Show her how to sign DRINK to get what she wants more quickly
and with a lot less frustration:
1. Form an ASL C with one hand as if you’re holding a drink.
See Appendix A for the ASL alphabet.
2. Mimic drinking by bringing your hand to your mouth and
tilting it several times (see Figure 5-2).
Figure 5-2: A DRINK sure would be nice right about now.
By the way, I cover the sign for MILK later in this chapter. The sign
for WATER is covered in Chapter 7’s discussion on scrubbing in the
tub. (If you’re interested in finding the sign for JUICE, check out
Chapter 17 to find a list of other signing resources.)
Chapter 5: Eat, Baby, Eat! Mealtime Signs 53

More
Many of your darlin’s frustrations stem from wanting MORE of
something. And I’m not just talking about your spouse wanting
more. Your other darlin’ wants MORE, too — MORE to eat, MORE to
drink, MORE swinging time, MORE bubbles — and he gets frus-
trated when you can’t make the connection. The sign for MORE
can come in handy several times a day, in countless scenarios.
Here’s how to make the sign:
1. Using both hands, make two flat-O hand shapes (see
Chapter 3).
2. Repeatedly touch the fingertips of both hands (see 
Figure 5-3).
Figure 5-3: MORE, please.
Finished
When your baby’s done eating, do you usually have a tyrant on
your hands, kicking and screaming while trying to get out of her
high chair? Such a joy.
Part II: Ready, Set, Sign! 
54

Granted, she’s too young to be able to say, “May I please be
excused?” But even though the words aren’t there yet, she can cer-
tainly let you know she’s FINISHED by using the sign. During every
meal, be sure to ask your baby, “Are you FINISHED?” and simulta-
neously show her how to make the sign, like this:
1. Place both hands in the air, near your shoulders, finger-
tips pointing up, palms facing away from your body.
2. Rotate your hands at the wrist so that your palms face
your body.
3. Repeat the rotation several times (see Figure 5-4).
Figure 5-4: I’m full and FINISHED, thank you very much.
Growing Food, Part I: Fruits
A tasty alternative to sugary snacks, fruit is a fantastic way to bring
growing food into your baby’s world without her realizing it’s good
for her. If you’re introducing fruits to your baby, why not sign the
words while saying them? In time, your little one will be able to let
you know which fruit she wants as a snack or with her meal. In this
section, I cover a few favorite fruit signs. Say and sign them when-
ever the opportunity presents itself. Then rinse and repeat.
Chapter 5: Eat, Baby, Eat! Mealtime Signs 55

Apple
She’s probably a bit too young to take an APPLE to her teacher, but
she probably loves seeing that bright, shiny, round, red thing you
munch on regularly. Be ready to define her curiosity with the sign
for APPLE:
1. Form an ASL letter A with one hand by making a fist and
placing your thumb against your index finger.
You can find the ASL alphabet in Appendix A.
2. While your hand is still in that position, place your
thumb on your cheek and twist your hand forward (see
Figure 5-5).
Figure 5-5: An APPLE a day. . . .
Banana
Bananas are a great finger food for junior, and the sign also works
great when you’re visiting the monkeys at the zoo. (Check out
Chapter 9 for animal signs.) The bonus is that the sign for BANANA
is fun to make. Check it out:
1. Raise one index finger, with the tip pointing to the sky.
Pretend this finger is a banana.
2. With your opposite hand, make the movements of peeling
a banana, starting at your fingertip and moving down
and out (see Figure 5-6).
Part II: Ready, Set, Sign! 
56

Figure 5-6: Monkey see, monkey do; may I have a BANANA, too?
Grapes
Yum! Grapes are a delicious addition to any healthy diet. And kids
love them. Of course, when you give grapes to your little sweetheart,
don’t forget to cut them into small pieces to avoid the choking-
hazard thing.
Whenever you’re cutting up grapes for a salad, snack, or meal, or
you’re popping them into your own mouth, talk about them to your
baby and make the sign for GRAPES like this:
1. Raise one elbow to shoulder height, and allow the rest of
your arm to dangle rag-doll style.
Your dangling arm represents the vine that grapes grow on.
2. Place the fingertips of your opposite hand facedown in
the area below the wrist of your dangling arm.
3. Bounce the fingers down to your dangling hand (see
Figure 5-7).
Chapter 5: Eat, Baby, Eat! Mealtime Signs 57

Figure 5-7: Bear the GRAPES or bear my wrath.
Peach
Even if you aren’t from the Peach State, Georgia, peaches are deli-
cious and perfect to give both yourself and your baby. Whenever
you’re dishing them out, talk the talk and walk the walk. In other
words, say and sign the word PEACH:
1. Make a relaxed-5 hand shape by first forming an open-5
shape (see Chapter 3) and then loosely bending your fin-
gers over.
2. While your hand is still in that position, lightly brush your
fingertips to your cheek several times (see Figure 5-8).
Berry
Blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries. . . . Many kids
love them, and the sign for BERRY can be used for all of them. Isn’t
ASL great? You make the sign like so:
1. Make a flat-O hand shape (see Chapter 3) with one hand
and extend the index finger of the other hand.
2. Now gently twist your flat-O hand on the tip of the oppo-
site index finger as if you were twisting the stem off the
cherry (see Figure 5-9).

Growing Food, Part II: Veggies
Everyone loves fruit — so much so, in fact, that veggies get a bad
rap in comparison. But vegetables are also an essential part of a
Chapter 5: Eat, Baby, Eat! Mealtime Signs 59

good diet. Introducing them to your baby is a good thing, and so is
leading by example (meaning eat your veggies, too, and for good-
ness’ sake don’t grimace while doing it). Say and sign various veg-
gies whenever the opportunity presents itself. This section
provides a few signs to help you get started.
Carrots
Carrots are full of fantastic fuel for your growing baby. Careful,
though, too many and your baby gets an orange tint to her skin,
making her look like the offspring of an Oompa Loompa. But that’s
off the point, which is to sign CARROT whenever you offer one to
your baby:
1. Make an ASL letter S (see Appendix A) by forming a fist
with your thumb wrapped around the outside of your 
fingers.
Pretend you’re holding a carrot in your fist. There you go.
That’s the position you need to hold.
2. Move your fist all the way to your mouth as if you’re
eating up a carrot (see Figure 5-10).
Figure 5-10: Care for a CARROT?
Part II: Ready, Set, Sign! 
60

Peas
Peas are a staple at many meals. They’re easy to prepare, fairly inex-
pensive, and an excellent growing food. Likewise, the sign for PEAS
is easy to make, totally free, and an excellent communication tool:
1. Extend both index fingers.
2. Use the tip of one index finger to touch the side of the
other index finger several times, moving from knuckle to
fingertip. (see Figure 5-11).
This motion indicates peas in a pod.
Figure 5-11: Mmm, PEAS.
Corn
Golden corn. Baby corn. Sweet corn. Corn on the cob. However
you dish it up, let your little nibblet know what he’s getting ready
to savor. Catch his eye, say, “Look at this yummy CORN. We’re
going to EAT some CORN,” and sign the pertinent words. Here’s
how to sign the word du jour:
Chapter 5: Eat, Baby, Eat! Mealtime Signs 61

1. Pretend you’re holding a cob of corn in your hands.
In other words, hold your hands out, palms facing each other,
with your fingers bent as if grasping the ends of the cob.
2. While keeping that position, move your hands to your
mouth.
3. Now turn your hands like you’re turning a corn cob as
you eat it (see Figure 5-12).
Figure 5-12: CORN is a fun sign to make.
Lettuce
Lots of people have salads with their meals — both at home and 
at restaurants. Next time you’re enjoying one, take the opportunity
to let baby know what salad is primarily made up of — LETTUCE.
Point out all that green stuff, say, “Look at all this LETTUCE! Do you
want to try some LETTUCE?”, and make the sign like this:
1. Imagine your head is a head of lettuce.
Okay, granted, you don’t actually have to do anything 
for the first step except get yourself in a vegetable state 
of mind.
2. Touch the heel of your palm to your head a couple of
times (see Figure 5-13).
With this motion, your hand is representing leaves of 
lettuce.
Part II: Ready, Set, Sign! 
62

Figure 5-13: That salad sure is full of LETTUCE!
Got Dairy?
Dairy products provide much-needed calcium and nutrients for
your rapidly growing baby, and, fortunately, many ways are avail-
able for your sweetie to get her daily quota. In this section, I pro-
vide the signs for two simple options — good ol’ milk and cheese —
because these two items probably have a permanent home in your
fridge and are a daily part of your baby’s life.
Milk
Whether it’s mommy’s milk or formula, MILK is the first drink for
babies. After babies are weaned from their bottle or their mother’s
breast, regular cow’s MILK is the next thing most babies drink. So
MILK is also a common introductory sign. And, lucky you, the sign
for breast, formula, or cow’s MILK is the same. Use it every time
your baby takes a bottle or has a drink of MILK:
1. Imagine that a cow is standing right beside you.
Okay, you don’t actually have to do anything for the first
step except get yourself in a Farmer Brown state of mind.
Think overalls, plaid shirt, and mud boots. And go ahead,
visualize a toothpick between your teeth.
Chapter 5: Eat, Baby, Eat! Mealtime Signs 63

2. Open and close the fist of one hand several times, little
finger closest to the floor (see Figure 5-14).
Yes, you’re pretending that you’re milking a cow. Moooo.
(And if you’re now totally in a farming frame of mind, pour
that child some milk, find a storybook on farm animals, and
read it together while baby enjoys her dairy. You can find
the sign for COW and other farm animals in Chapter 9.)
Figure 5-14: Moo! MILK comes from cows.
Cheese
Most kids love CHEESE on anything. Help your baby ask for CHEESE
when he wants it by showing him the sign while talking it up: “I
love CHEESE! I’m putting CHEESE on my sandwich. Do you want a
slice of CHEESE, too?” Making the sign is easy:
1. Place your palms together, fingers touching opposite
wrists.
2. Rub the heels of your palms together (see Figure 5-15).
To visualize this sign, think of squishing cheese in your
hands. Sounds like a fun thing to do, right? My kids sure
think so.
Grains = Vroom + Vroom
Children need grains to grow and to boost their energy levels. I
know, I hear ya: “But keeping up with them is tough enough without
Part II: Ready, Set, Sign! 
64

boosting their energy levels!” Okay, on second thought, maybe 
children don’t need grains in their diets.
Figure 5-15: CHEESE, please!
You know I’m kidding. Grains are a staple, so showing your munchkin
how to sign common grain foods is smart and practical. In this sec-
tion, I give you three starter signs that you and your baby can get a
lot of mileage out of: CEREAL, CRACKER, and SPAGHETTI.
Cereal
Infant rice and infant oatmeal cereal quickly progress to little
round circles of cereal, but the sign stays the same. Take the
opportunity to say and sign CEREAL whenever your little one is
slurping (and eventually crunching on) this common breakfast
food. Three steps and you’re there:
1. Cup one hand as though it’s a bowl.
2. Make an ASL C with the opposite hand (see Appendix A).
3. Extend the index and middle fingers of your opposite
hand to act as a spoon.
4. Bring your fingertips from the cupped hand to your
mouth as if you’re eating cereal (see Figure 5-16).
Chapter 5: Eat, Baby, Eat! Mealtime Signs 65

Figure 5-16: CEREAL — quite possibly the world’s perfect breakfast.
Cracker
Kids can drive you CRACKERS, but they also like to eat CRACKERS.
Sometimes they do both at the same time. Hopefully, you have more
times of the latter than the former with your little bundle of joy.
Crackers are a great and portable snack, so show your baby how
to sign for them. Think of it: No matter where you are — at home, a
friend’s house, the park, church, the mall — your baby will be able
to efficiently communicate her snacking desire, and you won’t
have to work through a frustrating set of 20 questions to figure out
why the crying fit. Here’s the sign for CRACKER:
1. Cross one arm over your chest.
2. Make a fist with your opposite hand.
3. Use the fist to tap the elbow of the crossed arm (see
Figure 5-17).
Part II: Ready, Set, Sign! 
66

Figure 5-17: Baby want a CRACKER?
Spaghetti
A small child eating spaghetti or other pastas is a joy to watch
(well, as long as the spaghetti isn’t attached to a sauce that stains).
And kids get as much joy doing the eating as the parents do the
watching. In other words, spaghetti is fun food, which makes it
common food in households with youngsters. If it’s on the weekly
menu at your house, sign SPAGHETTI while you’re all yucking it up
at the dinner table:
1. Extend the little fingers on both hands.
2. Move the fingers in circles in opposite directions (see
Figure 5-18).
The little fingers represent the thin consistency of
spaghetti.
Chapter 5: Eat, Baby, Eat! Mealtime Signs 67

Figure 5-18: SPAGHETTI is fun to eat and sign.
Fun Food! Desserts
As much as parents want their children to have healthy eating habits,
a little bit of dessert thrown in doesn’t hurt anything. Because cake
and cookies are common desserts for babies and toddlers, both at
home and at parties, this section covers those signs.
Cake
It’s Timmy’s first birthday. Grandma and Grandpa are on hand to
help celebrate. They’ve worn him out playing games and reading
interactive books. He’s worn himself out tearing open his gifts and
showing off his new skill — walking. But he can’t plop down for a
nap yet because Mom just lit the candle on his birthday cake. Big
occasion. Important dessert. Sign away:
1. Make an ASL letter C with one hand (see Appendix A).
2. Rest the pinkie of your C hand on your opposite hand,
which is flat out and palm up.
3. Move your C hand across the flat hand in the shape of an
X as if cutting a slice of cake (see Figure 5-19).
Part II: Ready, Set, Sign! 
68

Figure 5-19: Nothin’ says “special occasion” like a piece of CAKE.
Cookie
As much as little sweetheart likes cake, cookies can be much less
mess for you to clean up. They’re quick, easy, portable desserts
that come in lots of varieties, so they’re commonly found in the
homes of families. That makes them a prime candidate for signing
with baby. Here’s how to sign COOKIE:
1. Hold out one hand, palm open and facing up.
This hand is mimicking rolled-out cookie dough.
2. Form a C hand shape with your other hand (see
Appendix A).
This hand is mimicking a cookie cutter.
3. Lower your C hand, fingers and thumb pointing down,
onto the palm of your opposite hand and then twist,
raise, and lower your C hand again (see Figure 5-20).
Think in terms of using a cookie cutter to cut out cookie
shapes.

Signs to Help Keep Baby 
Safe and Sound
In This Chapter
 Keeping baby safe with signs
 Helping baby express his feelings and emotions
A
s a parent, I’ve never been naïve enough to think I wouldn’t
have to make a rush trip to the emergency room or doctor’s
office. However, I didn’t realize just how often I’d need to make such
a trip. Here’s a quickie sampling: a rock in the nose (3-year-old), a
broken nose (15-month-old), a gash in the forehead (2-year-old), as
well as various nasty ear infections and bouts of continual vomiting
and sky-high fevers. And I’ve only been a parent for four years.
You may be laughing, or horrified — but no matter how safe you
try to keep your kids, you may be right where I am soon enough.
Up front and beforehand, be aware of the amount of stress that
emergency trips create within the family system. I’ve found that on
several occasions, signing helped out tremendously.
But emergencies aside, the signs covered in this chapter can help
you and your baby communicate effectively during various trials
and tribulations of everyday life. You can use these signs for an
ounce of prevention as well as to help your baby understand what
she’s feeling in various situations.
Ounce-of-Prevention Signs
Every day is a trial when you have a baby in the house. As a parent,
you have to stay on guard constantly to ensure that little sweetums
doesn’t hurt himself. Regularly communicating safety words is good
preventive maintenance. Whenever you do so, I recommend that
you also sign the safety words. In time, maybe your little one will

start signing the words, too — which will benefit you in all kinds of
trying situations. This section covers some handy safety signs to
keep in your back pocket for use at a moment’s notice.
Hot
So your baby is fascinated by the fire in the fireplace. Aren’t we all?
But how do you explain to baby not to touch a fire? After all, the
fire is very pretty and he likes to touch pretty things.
The best way I’ve found to combat that potentially dangerous
curiosity is to proactively teach the appropriate sign, which will
help later, just as he’s reaching for the fireplace. The appropriate
sign is HOT, and here’s how to make it:
1. Make an ASL letter C with either hand (see Appendix A).
2. While holding the C position, place your fingertips just
under your nose, and your thumb tip just under your
bottom lip.
3. Quickly move your hand away from your mouth and
twist your wrist so that your fingertips are facing away
from your body (see Figure 6-1).
Think in terms of quickly turning away something that’s hot.

Cold
Your little neck of the woods just had its first big snowfall of the
season. Woo-hoo! So you take baby over to the window and show
her the pretty, white stuff in the backyard. You then tell her that
she gets to go outside to play in the snow. She gets really psyched
and immediately makes a beeline for the back door.
Not so fast, kiddo. You scramble to catch her and explain, “It’s
COLD out there! We’ll get very COLD if we go outside without our
coats! Let’s get ready to go outside in the COLD!” Sign the word
COLD each time you say it:
1. Make fists with both hands and hold them at shoulder
level.
2. Shake your fists and arms as if you’re shivering in the
cold (see Figure 6-2).
Figure 6-2: Talk about COLD!
A great way to teach your baby the difference between HOT and
COLD is to use a cold pack and a heating pad (set on low) or a
warm pack. Hold the cold pack in baby’s hand and sign and say
“COLD!” Do the same thing with the sign for HOT. Any time you’re
around HOT and/or COLD things, use the opportunity to show the
sign. Teachable moments may be during extreme HOT or COLD
Chapter 6: Signs to Help Keep Baby Safe and Sound 73

weather or if the bath water is one extreme or the other. Just make
sure that what you’re having your baby touch isn’t so extreme that
it’ll hurt her.
Stop
STOP is a fabulous sign to have in your back pocket, because you
can use it for many situations. I recently used STOP when my 15-
month-old son headed for the street during a play date. I yelled
“STOP!” and when he turned to see why Mommy was yelling, I
signed STOP as I ran to scoop him up. Here’s how to make the sign:
1. Hold out one hand as if preparing to shake hands with
someone.
2. Hold out your opposite hand so that the palm is 
facing up.
3. Use the edge of Step 1’s hand to come down sharply on
your opposite hand’s palm (see Figure 6-3).

Wait
Waiting is hard for little people, whether they’re waiting at the gro-
cery store, at a stop light, or for special friends to visit. Regardless
of how hard it is, waiting is a fact of life — and it’s often an impor-
tant safety net to boot.
The sign for WAIT is a great communication tool for many occa-
sions. For example, I use it daily when I’m trying to talk on the
phone and my kids suddenly decide they need my undivided atten-
tion. Sound familiar? After many attempts, it actually works. Here’s
how to make the sign:
1. With both hands, make the open-5 hand shape (see
Chapter 3), palms facing up and fingertips curled.
2. Wiggle your fingers while making a stern face (see 
Figure 6-4).
Figure 6-4: Now WAIT a minute!
Chapter 6: Signs to Help Keep Baby Safe and Sound 75

Careful
CAREFUL is a fantastic sign to use with your baby and/or toddler.
Think of it: From across the playground, you can tell your climber
to be CAREFUL without yelling your head off. What a great idea,
and it all starts with two simple steps:
1. Make two K hands (see Appendix A).
2. Turn your K hands sideways (pinkie-sides down), place
one K hand on top of the other, and tap a few times (see
Figure 6-5).
Figure 6-5: CAREFUL now!
Hurt
How many times a day does your precious bundle of joy get hurt?
She falls down and bumps her head. She walks into the glass slid-
ing door. She gets banged around by an older sibling. And don’t
forget when she gets her feelings hurt for one reason or another.
And on the other side of matters, what about when she head-butts
you or explores with those tiny and strong teeth and jaw muscles?
The bottom line: HURT is just a regular part of her (and your) day.
You’ll both get a lot of mileage out of this sign:
Part II: Ready, Set, Sign! 
76

1. Extend both index fingers and repeatedly almost touch
their tips.
That action signs HURT in general. If you want to show a
specific place on the body that HURTS, follow Step 2. If you
want to show that feelings are HURT, skip Step 2 and follow
Step 3 instead.
2. If a specific body part hurts, move your hands to the
vicinity of the body part that hurts while doing Step 1.
If your child’s ear hurts, for example, make the HURT sign
at your child’s ear. If his knee hurts, make the sign there.
Teeth? Sign at his mouth. And so on.
3. If feelings are hurt instead of a body part, twist your
hands and fingers in opposite directions over your heart
while doing Step 1 and making a sad face (see Figure 6-6).
Figure 6-6: My feelings are HURT.
Help
As your baby has been growing and exploring, he has found that
grunting tends to get him what he wants — until now. Any time
during interactions with your baby, any moment when he needs
you to do something for him, sign HELP. When the grunts and
Chapter 6: Signs to Help Keep Baby Safe and Sound 77

screams begin, say things like, “Do you want a cracker? Let
Mommy HELP you.” Then sign the word like this:
1. Place a fist, thumb up, on top of the opposite palm.
2. While keeping that position, move both hands up (see
Figure 6-7).
Imagine the palm hand helping the fist up.
Figure 6-7: Some HELP would be nice.
Sick
Next time your sweetheart throws up all over you or is miserable
with a sinus infection, show her the sign for SICK to help her iden-
tify this yucky feeling. Take it from me, when your sweetie gets the
hang of this sign, it’ll be invaluable. Here’s how to do it:
1. Extend the middle fingers of both hands.
2. Place one finger in the middle of your forehead and the
other at your belly button.
3. Tap your forehead and belly button a few times (see
Figure 6-8).
Part II: Ready, Set, Sign! 
78

Figure 6-8: That yucky feeling means you’re SICK.
Medicine
The sign for MEDICINE is great for use with teething-relief meds 
or even diaper-rash cream (see the nearby sidebar “Red-bottom
blues”). And MEDICINE usually goes hand in hand with SICK or
HURT. Explain to your little one what’s going on (“I know your
bottom is sore. I’ll put some MEDICINE on it to make the HURT go
away.”) and simultaneously sign the pertinent words.
MEDICINE is signed like this:
1. Extend the middle finger of one hand.
2. Cup the opposite hand and place the fingertip of your
middle finger in its palm.
3. Move your middle finger around a few times without
removing it from your palm (see Figure 6-9).
Think of your cupped hand as a mortar and your finger as a
pestle from the days of grinding medicine.

Red-bottom blues
When my daughter Aidan Elizabeth was 16 months old, I was preparing to change
her diaper one day, and as I pulled out the diaper and wipes, she looked up at me
and signed MEDICINE and then patted her diaper. She hadn’t been sick at all and I
was confused.
“Aidan Elizabeth, why do you need MEDICINE?” I asked and signed. She repeated
the sign and patted her diaper again. Still baffled, I went on with the diaper change.
But as I wiped her bottom, I noticed the beginnings of a diaper rash. She needed
diaper-rash cream for her reddening bottom, and she had figured out how to ask
for it instead of just screaming to let me know she was in pain.

in to me that when I’ve had a bad day, they seem to have a bad day,
too. Yikes. No pressure. Add those mood swings to 50,000 errands
in the pouring rain and it’s likely you who’ll be pitching the fit.
Identifying feelings for children as those feelings are expressed will
help your kids be better communicators in the long run. And sign-
ing the feelings will enhance communication even more. Here are
some feeling signs to get started.
Angry
Allowing children to be ANGRY in appropriate ways is crucial to
their emotional development. Many people, myself included at
times, allow anger to build up and then come out in one raging fit.
Hmm, wonder if that’s where my kids get it. . . .
Use the sign for ANGRY to help define a feeling exactly when your
child is screaming and protesting something. For example, say,
“You look ANGRY. I think you’re ANGRY because your brother took
your ball from you. It’s all right to be ANGRY. Let’s go tell brother
you’re ANGRY and ask to have your ball back.”
Signing provides your little one a definition for his feelings, as well
as reassures him that his feelings are perfectly normal. It’s not the
feeling that’s the problem; it’s what he does with the feeling that’s
important.
Chapter 6: Signs to Help Keep Baby Safe and Sound 81
ANGRY takes over
A friend of mine was waiting in an airport with a frustrated toddler. Yikes. Luckily, this
was also a signing toddler. In a last-ditch effort to entertain him, she allowed him to
play in a nearby wheelchair that wasn’t being used. Hey, whatever it takes to keep
him happy, or just keep him from not screaming.
It was time to move on and Josh wasn’t ready yet (surprise, surprise), so Beryt
scooped him up and a walleyed fit ensued as she attempted to juggle her carry-on,
the diaper bag and a screaming toddler. Oh yes, people were looking.
Having recently learned the sign for ANGRY, Beryt said, “Josh, are you ANGRY
because Mommy took you away from the wheelchair? You’re ANGRY because you
still want to play with the wheelchair.” Josh quit screaming, looked her in the eye,
and signed ANGRY for the first time.

Here’s how to make the ANGRY sign:
1. Make the open-5 hand shape, palm toward your face (see
Chapter 3).
2. Pull your hand away from your face, scrunching up your
fingers (see Figure 6-10).
Your fingers represent the furrows that appear on an
ANGRY face.
Figure 6-10: It’s normal to feel ANGRY sometimes.
Happy
HAPPY was one of my son Cole’s first words and signs. Of course,
with Cole it sounds something like “appy” and the sign isn’t exactly
the way mine is, but it’s still very cute to pick up Cole from a care-
giver and watch him sign and say HAPPY. Trust me, this sign
causes hearts to melt everywhere.
Now for the sign:
1. Place your palms at upper-chest level, hands open and
facing your torso.
Part II: Ready, Set, Sign! 
82

2. Make little circles with your hands or pat your chest (see
Figure 6-11).
Think of your hands as your happy feelings when you peek
at your sleeping baby. HAPPY just bubbles up out of your
heart, which is fine unless it makes some noise and wakes
up your sleeping angel.
Figure 6-11: If you’re HAPPY and you know it, make the sign!
Sad
If you’re around small children regularly (and I’m assuming you 
are — otherwise, why would you be reading this book?), you know
that SAD is something that can happen at the drop of a hat, such 
as over hurt feelings or someone leaving. Get the sign SAD in your
vocabulary and you can distract junior from a SAD fit or tantrum
by giving him something to do with his hands:
1. Using both hands, place your spread-out fingers at your
face, palms toward your head so that you’re peeking out
between your fingers.
2. Making a SAD face, draw your hands down to approxi-
mately shoulder level (see Figure 6-12).
This motion is emulating a child’s drooping face. As you
make the sign for SAD, imagine your child’s face drooping
when he isn’t allowed something he desperately wants.
Chapter 6: Signs to Help Keep Baby Safe and Sound 83

Figure 6-12: So SAD.
Scared
In Baby/Toddler World, feeling scared is common. Some children
are scared of monsters in the middle of the night. Others are
scared of the dark. And some are even scared of the loud bark of
an unfamiliar dog. If feeling SCARED is part of your child’s world,
use the sign for SCARED to help her define the feeling: “I know
you’re SCARED, but I promise there are no monsters in your room.
Look with me — no monsters under your bed or in your closet, so
you don’t have to feel SCARED anymore.”
Here’s how to make the sign:
1. Make loose fists with both hands; place one at shoulder
level, the other just above hip level.
2. While making a scared face, move your hands into the
open-5 hand shape, wrists crossing each other quickly in
front of your body as if you’re protecting your body from
something scary (see Figure 6-13).
Part II: Ready, Set, Sign! 
84

Figure 6-13: It’s normal to feel SCARED sometimes.
Safe
SAFE is a great sign to use when you’ve just rescued your nervous
baby from a boisterous older sibling or cousin. You can also use
SAFE when baby is overwhelmed by his doting grandmother and
needs the SAFETY of your arms. And if you’re bonding with baby 
at his first baseball game, go ahead and excitedly sign, “And he’s
SAFE!” when a player steals home base, scoring for the home team.
So many uses. Go for it:
1. Cross your arms at your wrists, hands in S shapes, palms
facing but not touching your body.
2. Pull your hands apart while twisting palms to face away
from your body, stopping at the shoulder area. Keep
those S shapes (see Figure 6-14).
Chapter 6: Signs to Help Keep Baby Safe and Sound 85

Figure 6-14: All SAFE now.
Sorry
It’s bound to happen: At some point, your sweet little baby is going
to do something that requires an apology. With any luck, the infrac-
tion will occur within the family unit and be as simple as, say, taking
sister’s toy. However, it may be something outside the family that
draws blood, such as biting one of her friends during a play date.
One way or another, your child needs to know that her action was
wrong and that she must say she’s sorry. If she’s too young to talk
yet, saying she’s sorry through sign language is the way to go.
Here’s the sign for SORRY:
1. Make a sad, apologetic face.
2. Make an ASL letter S by forming a fist with your 
thumb wrapped around the outside of your fingers 
(see Appendix A).
3. Place your fist, palm facing your body, over your heart
and make a circle (see Figure 6-15).
Remember your mom saying, “Apologies don’t count
unless they come from the heart.”
Part II: Ready, Set, Sign! 
86

Figure 6-15: From the heart, I’m truly SORRY.
Use the sign for SORRY in various situations where an apology is
due so that your sweet little baby will begin to understand what
SORRY really means. For example, say and sign, “Molly was reading
that BOOK. Please give it back and tell her you’re SORRY that you
took it from her.” Or say, “Bobby is HURT because you bit him.
That made him CRY, and he needs MEDICINE to feel better. Tell
Bobby you’re SORRY for HURTing him.” (The sign for BOOK is in
Chapter 7; the signs for HURT, MEDICINE, and CRY are elsewhere in
this chapter.)
Smile
Just like puppies, babies draw smiles wherever they go, assuming
they’re in a smiley mood, of course. A baby who’s throwing a
screaming fit in the checkout aisle doesn’t draw smiles — that baby
draws snarls.
Extra-cranky times aside, most babies do draw smiles from people
they come into contact with. Of course, these are typically people
who no longer have small children at home and are missing “the
good ol’ days.” Believe me, sometimes I want to say, “Go ahead —
take him and relive those days. . . . I could really use the break.”
But, alas, instead I usually say, “Yes, he’s a doll. I wouldn’t trade
him for anything in the world.” Except for a plane ticket to the
Caribbean for a week. But I digress.
Chapter 6: Signs to Help Keep Baby Safe and Sound 87

Help your baby define and understand the expression by showing
him the sign for SMILE at various opportunities when others — 
or baby himself — is smiling. Bonus: Think of how you’ll impress
those lookey-loos if your smiley baby signs SMILE at an appropri-
ate moment. Get ready, get set, SMILE:
1. With both hands, form an ASL letter L by extending 
your index fingers and holding out your thumbs (see
Appendix A).
In other words, form the shape of a capital L with your
index finger and thumb — both hands here.
2. Place the tips of your index fingers at the corners of your
mouth and draw a SMILE up your cheeks, breaking into
an actual smile while doing so (see Figure 6-16).
Figure 6-16: SMILE and the world smiles with you.
Laugh
Not much is more fulfilling than having a laughing child from a
simple game of peek-a-boo. While you’re both laughing in the midst
of the game, be sure to sign LAUGH to help define the sound coming
from his mouth and to help him understand the feeling associated
with it. Say and sign something like, “This game is fun and it’s
making you LAUGH! It’s making MAMA LAUGH, too!” Chapter 4 
contains the sign for MAMA, and the following steps contain the
sign for LAUGH:
Part II: Ready, Set, Sign! 
88

1. Make the sign for SMILE (see the preceding section for
details).
2. Repeat the SMILE sign several times by continually 
drawing a smile on your face with your fingertips 
(see Figure 6-17).
Think of LAUGHING as expressing lots and lots of SMILES.
Figure 6-17: LAUGH till you cry — it’s good for the soul.
Cry
Babies and crying go together like income and taxes. Can’t have
one without the other. As you know, babies cry because they’re
hurt, they’re sleepy, they’re hungry, they’re bored, and simply
because they’re babies. They also tend to notice other children
who are crying. On all such occasions, show your baby the sign for
CRY to help her define the sound and understand the feeling asso-
ciated with it. For example, the next time you see another child
crying at the park, say and sign something like this: “That BABY
fell down and is HURT — that’s why he’s CRYing.” See Chapter 4 for
BABY, Chapter 6 for HURT, and the following steps for the sign du
jour, CRY:
1. With both hands, extend your index fingers and touch
them just under your eyes.
2. Pretend your fingers are tears and draw tracks of tears
down your face (see Figure 6-18).

Bath and Bed Signs

ath time and bedtime. For most adults, that sounds like
heaven, especially after a long day of working hard and trying
to keep up with the kids. But, as you’re keenly aware, what sounds
like heaven to adults is often, well, the opposite of heaven to kids.
Granted, sometimes bath time and bedtime are a relaxing end to
little sugar dumpling’s busy day. But many times, sugar dumpling
doesn’t particularly like or want to cooperate with these two nightly
routines, so he morphs into a sourpuss, turning the whole shebang
into a nightmare of screaming, splashing water out of the tub, contin-
uously waking up, and/or absolutely refusing to go to sleep. Lovely.
Signing to the rescue! This chapter covers a few basic signs to help
you and your child communicate easily with each other from bath
to bed — from dirty and disheveled to squeaky clean and snug as a
bug in a rug. Now that is lovely.
Scrubbing in the Tub
The best time to introduce signs related to bath time isn’t 10 a.m.
at the kitchen table in a formal teaching lesson while junior’s get-
ting his midmorning fix of Cheerios and apple juice. Instead, you
want to introduce bath-time signs in the natural context and set-
ting of that particular routine in your house. For many people,
that’s in the early evening in the bathroom while junior’s getting
his nightly fix of being a sourpuss.
In this section, I cover four signs for communicating words that are
common during scrub-a-dub-dub-in-the-tub time.

Bath
It’s 7:30 p.m. on Monday night. Dinner’s done, the jumbo building
blocks are finally picked up and back in the toy box, and little
buddy is rubbing his eyes. Perfect opportunity to introduce the
sign for BATH. Catch your child’s eye and say, “Almost time for
BATH!” As you’re saying BATH, sign the word like this:
1. With both hands, make loose fists, thumbs on top.
2. Place your fists on your chest like you’re Tarzan getting
ready to beat on your chest.
3. Move your fists in several circles as if scrubbing your
chest (see Figure 7-1).
You’ve just signed BATH. Piece of cake. (Well, not really.
CAKE is in Chapter 5, which covers mealtime and various
foods.)
Figure 7-1: Signing the word BATH.
Always reinforce a sign by repeating yourself as often as possible
after first introducing it. In the case of BATH, for example, after
first introducing the sign, wait a minute and then do it again: Catch
your child’s eye a second time, say, “Let’s go take a BATH!”, and
make the sign again very excitedly. Then scoop your child up and
trot to the bathroom. Keep discussing and signing BATH through-
out your bath-time routine.

Water
Before depositing sweetie pie unceremoniously into the tub, better
get the water going and test the temperature first. And why not sign
the word WATER to keep her in the loop? Simply start the bath water
and say, “Look! I’m putting WATER in the tub for your BATH!” Sign
all the pertinent words as you say them. Here’s how to sign the
word du jour — WATER:
1. Hold up three fingers, the sign for W (see Appendix A).
2. While still holding up your three fingers, tap your chin
twice with the side of your first finger (see Figure 7-2).
Figure 7-2: WATER, anyone?
Chapter 7: Bath and Bed Signs 93
Hey, Mom, I really need to get cleaned up!
When children are just 18 months old, parents generally don’t expect them to say
they’re ready for the tub. In fact, 18-month-olds seem to want to stay dirty instead
of washing up! But Aubrey was different. A signing baby, she liked to get squeaky
clean after a full day of playing. On one particular day, after Aubrey finished with a
pleasantly filthy experience in the mud, her mom asked if she was dirty. Aubrey
laughed and signed BATH on the spot. She knew she was dirty and needed to get
cleaned up. Aren’t you ready for your child to tell you she’s ready for her bath?

After your child learns the sign for a word, she can sometimes use
it in a totally different context. Take WATER, for example. When
baby gets a handle on signing WATER, she can let you know that
she’s ready to get in the water for her bath or that she wants some
water to drink. Same word, same sign, different uses.
American Sign Language doesn’t have a sign for every word in the
English language, and tub is one of those words without a specific
sign. So you have to work around the issue by using a combo of
other signs to get the point across. For purposes of this book,
though, if you have BATH and WATER covered, you’re in good
shape during bath time with baby, so don’t fret about trying to
come up with a combination of signs for tub.
Bubbles
Water and bubbles go together like peas and carrots. If you have a
young’un in the house, chances are you also have a bottle of
bubble bath in the cabinet. So why not take an opportunity to let
your little one communicate an independent decision? Show him
how to sign BUBBLES and regularly ask him, “Do you want some
BUBBLES in your BATH?” Here’s how to make the sign:
1. Make the flat-O hand shape with both hands, fingertips
pointing up (see Chapter 3).
2. Open and close your hands while alternately moving
them up and down in front of your body (see Figure 7-3).
The signs for PLAY and STOP can come in handy when communi-
cating info about bubbles in the tub. (Ditto when communicating
info about splashing in the tub, covered in the following section.) 
If you’re interested in finding out how to sign PLAY, turn to 
Chapter 10. And for STOP, turn to Chapter 6.
Splash
Little ones are notorious for making messes during bath time. After
all, splashing water is loads of fun — and so is splashing Mom and
Dad. For a kid, watching your reaction to getting a little bit wet is
totally worth bearing your wrath afterward.

Figure 7-3: Yay! BUBBLES!
As with many things in life, moderation is key. So is communica-
tion. Develop both with your little one by using the sign for
SPLASH during bath time:
1. Make two fists and place them together in front of 
your body.
2. In a quick movement, move your fists out to the oppo-
site sides of your body, showing the number five (see
Appendix B) with both hands, palms facing away from
your body (see Figure 7-4).
Chapter 7: Bath and Bed Signs 95

Figure 7-4: SPLASH!
Getting Ready for Bed
So your little bundle of energy is done with her bath and clean as 
a whistle, and now you’re ready to wind her down and send her
gently into la-la land. Using a simple signing routine at bedtime
each night will help develop solid communication between you
and your child, and the consistency aspect will help your child feel
in the know and more secure during bedtime.
This section covers signs for a few words that are commonly used
during bedtime routines. If your child’s routine is currently a night-
mare, incorporating these two-way-communication signs may help
turn the nightmare into a dream.
Toothbrush
Time to get those pearly whites sparkling! Although babies gener-
ally do little more than chew on their toothbrushes, TOOTHBRUSH
is still a useful sign:
1. Extend your index finger on either hand.
2. Pretending your index finger is a toothbrush, place it
parallel with your mouth.
Part II: Ready, Set, Sign! 
96

3. Open your lips, show your teeth, and move your index
finger up and down (see Figure 7-5).
Feel free to add sound effects to mimic the sound of a
toothbrush brushing while signing. Even if you feel a bit
goofy, your baby will likely pay more attention because
you’re making an odd sound!
Figure 7-5: Brushing with my TOOTHBRUSH.
Tired
Whether it’s you or your sweetie pie, feeling exhausted is common
in families with small children. Using a sign to communicate this
reality is helpful, and the sign TIRED does the job just fine.
1. Place the fingertips of both hands on the front of each
respective shoulder.
You may look a bit like a duck flapping its wings. (If this
stance has put you in a ducky mood, feel free to discover
the sign for DUCK in Chapter 9 on animals.)
2. Roll your shoulders in, letting your hands move with
them (see Figure 7-6).
Imagine (probably not too difficult right now) that you’re
so exhausted, you can’t even hold your shoulders back.
(Sorry about the bad posture, Mom!)
Chapter 7: Bath and Bed Signs 97

Figure 7-6: Slumpy me, I’m so TIRED.
American Sign Language is a very expressive language. Make sure
your facial expression matches whatever sign you’re trying to com-
municate with your baby (or anyone else for that matter).
Bed
When you or your sweetie pie is TIRED, hopefully you can go to
BED. If you’re lucky, this scenario may actually happen at the same
time. Be ready to communicate with the sign for BED:
1. Place the palm of your hand on your ear.
If you use your left hand, use your left ear. If you use your
right hand, use your right ear.
2. Tilt your head to the same side, as if you’re using your
hand for a pillow (see Figure 7-7).

Sleep
Granted, I realize full well that sleep can be elusive with a baby or
toddler in the house. I have three toddlers in my house, so I’m all
too familiar with this concept. Regardless of the odds against you,
don’t give up on the quest for sleep. At naptime and bedtime,
always say and sign the magic words. Reiterate to sweetie pie that
you know he’s TIRED, which is why he’s in BED. Then say, “It’s time
for you to SLEEP now,” and sign the word like this:
1. Using an open-5 hand shape, have your palm looking at
your face (see Chapter 3).
2. Slowly pull the open-5 hand shape into a flat-O hand
shape (again, see Chapter 3), fingertips up.
3. As you pull your open-5 hand into a flat-O, roll your head
forward (see Figure 7-8).
Your head is so heavy you can’t hold it up anymore!

Book
Okay, so sweetie pie is acting more like a grapefruit (sour). She’s
tired, she’s in bed, but she’s certainly not willing to go to sleep just
yet. Reading can be a calming transition to nighty-night time, and
the sign for BOOK can also be useful when she pulls all the books
off the shelf, leaving a terrific mess that needs to be cleaned up.
Coax little grapefruit back into a sweetie pie (à la) mode by saying,
“We’ll read a BOOK if you’ll go to SLEEP as soon as we’re done.”
Here’s how to sign the magic word BOOK:
1. Place your palms together in front of your body, finger-
tips pointing away from your body.
2. Open your hands, palms facing up, like you’re opening a
book (see Figure 7-9).
When reading with your child, pick out one or two signs to sign
throughout the book. What does the book have on every page? 
If it’s a DOG, sign DOG every time you turn the page. (DOG and
more animal signs are covered in Chapter 9.) And don’t forget the
always-there, handy-dandy sign for WHAT (see Chapter 1). The
sign for WHAT can get you through any book, in addition to just
about any other situation with your little sweetie.

Whether it’s a teddy BEAR, monkey, or doll, children usually have
some type of lovey to hold onto at night. You know, the one you’re
always retrieving in the middle of the night after it falls out of the
bed (or, worse, running out to the family car in your jammies to
fetch before your little one can calm down and go to sleep). I’m
giving you the sign for BEAR because it’s one of the most common
companions, but you can look up some other animals in Chapter 9
if you need them:
1. Make an X with your arms over your chest, palms near
shoulders.
2. Use your fingertips and nails to scratch your chest a
couple of times (see Figure 7-10).
Growl a bit for some added fun!

Figure 7-10: Who needs his teddy BEAR?
Blanket
Sometimes sweetie may be thinking, “Forget the teddy, I want my
blankey!” And because sweetie can’t say the words yet, the sign for
BLANKET comes in very handy:
1. Make loose fists, palms facing the floor at your waist.
2. Pull your hands up to shoulder level like you’re pulling
up a warm and cuddly BLANKEY (see Figure 7-11).
Lights
At some point in your child’s evening routine, the time for LIGHTS
out in one form or fashion will finally and mercifully come. Hallelujah!
Hopefully, your little sweetie is nodding off enough to avoid any
screaming. Here’s how to sign that it’s time for LIGHTS out:
1. Using a flat-O hand shape, raise your hand above your
head with fingertips pointing down.
2. Spread your fingers out to create an open-5 hand shape
(see Chapter 3) to show that the lights are currently on.
3. Pull your fingers back into the flat-O hand shape to show
that it’s time for LIGHTS to go out (see Figure 7-12).

awakened in a few hours to find the bear or blankey that’s hit 
the floor.

Signs for Everyday

In this part . . .
S
o tell me, what makes baby go ga-ga? Is it animals?
Trains? The wind blowing in his face? Baby is more
likely to respond to signs for items he’s interested in.
Although interests vary from baby to baby, there are a few
commonly agreed upon objects of affection, and they’re
usually things that are part of baby’s everyday life.
That’s the focus of Part III — signs for everyday life. Here,
you ﬁnd signs for clothing (don’t you love how they empty
out the sock drawer when you’re not looking?), signs for
some popular animals (including some of my family’s
favorites), and signs for objects in the great outdoors.
What are a few of your baby’s favorite things? Go ahead,
sing the song and get signing.

hat to wear, what to wear. My three kids have more clothes
in their closets than I do. Really. They were the first grand-
kids on both sides of the family, and seven grandparents and three
great-grandmothers have supplied more clothes than we’ll ever
know what to do with. Keeping up with all those clothes is a night-
mare. The girls’ sock drawer alone strikes fear in my heart with all
the colors, beads, and lace. Think about the maintenance. I mean,
who really wants or has time to iron or line-dry all those items
loaded with assorted frou-frou?
If you’re like me, you’ll realize soon enough that buying the basics
is much easier and much more cost-effective than buying fancy
outfits. Besides, let’s be frank: The moment she’s dressed in that
gorgeous smocked dress that cost you (or your mother) major
bucks, Little Miss Messy Mess poops or spits up or spills all over
it. And then there’s the quick strip and soak in an attempt to get
the stain out. Ack.
In this chapter, I give you some signs for basic clothing. Trust me,
basic is the best way to go — with clothing as well as signs for baby.
Typical Playwear
Playing is a major part of the day for babies and toddlers. And to
make the most of their day, they need to be wearing clothing that
doesn’t get in the way. I’m talking about everyday wear, rough-and-
tumble clothes, your basic shirt, pants, socks, and shoes. In this
section, I cover the signs for these very items. When you’re getting

baby dressed in the morning, start talking about how he’s going to
PLAY today (you can find the sign for PLAY in Chapter 10) and dis-
cuss each item of clothing as you put it on him.
Shirt
One of my daughter Darby’s biggest milestones to date was learning
to take her SHIRT off by herself. She’d say, “Watch me!” and take off
her SHIRT. Then we’d have to clap. Ah, firstborn children. . . .
A good time to introduce signs to babies is when you’re showing
them how to do various tasks, like putting on or taking off their
shirt. So anytime you’re putting on or taking off your baby’s shirt,
say and sign the word. In addition, use the sign for SHIRT when you
have a fussy baby who’s refusing to get dressed. With any luck,
signing will distract her long enough for you to slip the SHIRT over
her head. And if all else fails, there’s always the peek-a-boo game
with the SHIRT. Usually, playing peek-a-boo turns babies from fussy
to fascinated lickety-split.
Here’s the SHIRT sign:
1. With the index finger and thumb of each hand, pinch a
bit of your shirt just below your shoulders.
2. Pull out and let go of the shirt a couple of times (see
Figure 8-1).

Pants
Recently, my son Cole discovered the fasteners on his diapers.
Then he started taking his diaper off and running around the house
naked, which inevitably led to him peeing somewhere. Last week, it
was on my foot. The girls never did anything like this.
I have a point here. The way my husband and I have discovered to
combat this act of nudity (and the bodily function that always
accompanies it) is fairly simple: We leave PANTS on him all the
time. He hasn’t yet figured out how to pull down the PANTS and get
to the diaper. Yes, I know the day will come, but for now PANTS
seem to do the trick.
If you have a budding nudist as well, try using this strategy to keep
your own feet dry. And while putting pants on He Who Streaks A
Lot, go ahead and communicate what you’re doing: “Here are your
PANTS! Let’s put your PANTS on before you go PLAY!” See Chapter
10 for the PLAY sign and see the following steps for the PANTS sign:
1. Face your palms toward each other, about 6 inches apart,
fingertips pointing down.
2. Starting at your waist, move both hands down one leg,
back up to your waist, and then down your other leg (see
Figure 8-2).
Socks
Don’t get me started on baby socks. Granted, they’re so tiny and
they come in such wonderful coordinating colors and cute little
prints. But take warning here: They seem to multiply on their own.
Nearly every baby outfit has matching socks to go with it, and as a
result, my daughters’ sock drawer is overflowing.
The upside is that baby socks, even the frou-frou kind, serve a
functional purpose — to keep those little piggy toes warm — so
you’ll get good use out of them. When you’re shuffling through the
sock drawer in the morning, trying to find the pair that matches
the outfit du jour, sign away to show baby what you’re looking for.
She’ll get the hang of the sign soon enough, and then one day when
you’re running late and need to cover her feet, she can help you
find the SOCKS she shed during breakfast, playtime, or in the car.
Chapter 8: Signing Stuff That Baby Wears 109

Figure 8-2: PANTS: Never leave home without ’em.
Here’s the sign:
1. Extend both index fingers and place them, touching, side
by side, fingertips pointing down.
2. While keeping your fingers touching, alternate moving
them up and down, pointing toward your socks, repeat-
ing the motion several times (see Figure 8-3).
Part III: Signs for Everyday Life 
110

Shoes
Shoes are big business. Everybody knows that. But did you know
baby shoes are big business? You can buy nearly any brand of
adult shoes in baby sizes and pay almost as much as you do for
your own shoes. This is especially true in the athletic-shoe market.
(No surprise there, eh?)
No matter what kind you choose to put on your baby’s feet, or
whether they’re for function or show, the sign for SHOES is the same:
1. Make two fists, thumbs in front.
2. Tap your fists together a couple of times (see Figure 8-4).
Why the tapping? Think of Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz
click-click-clicking her heels together. Little dog optional.

Stuff That Keeps Baby 
Toasty Outside
Depending on where you live, the weather outside can be frightful.
And sometimes you just can’t stay inside, where it’s so delightful.
So if there’s someplace to go, you gotta deal with the snow, with
the snow, with the snow. Or something like that.
During such times, your baby may not understand all the extra-thick
clothing you throw on her or the strange feeling that envelops her
when she steps outside (the brrrr feeling), but both are a part of
life. Use sign language to help her understand what all the fuss is
about. This section gives you the signs for three basic pieces of
outerwear that keep babies toasty and comfortable: HAT, COAT,
and MITTENS.
Part III: Signs for Everyday Life 
112

Hat
Hats are an important piece of outerwear when you’re heading out-
side. They trap body heat to help keep you warm. The bonus is
that even if you’re not heading outside, hats can still be an impor-
tant piece of outerwear. Hats are fun to play with, and at my house,
we have tons of dress-up HATS for just about every occupation,
from princess to firefighter. As a result, the sign for HAT is a favorite
of my kids. They even use the sign HAT for a family friend who
wears a HAT regularly.
The sign is the same no matter what the occasion. Next time you’re
off to play in any weather, inside or out, use the sign HAT when it’s
time to put one on your baby’s head:
1. Make a flat hand with one hand.
2. Pat your head a few times (see Figure 8-5).
Figure 8-5: Don’t forget your HAT!
Coat
I live in southeast Texas, so we don’t get much chance to use
heavy winter coats. My family owns them, but last winter we only
pulled them out once, when the high was 34°F (1°C) and it was
Chapter 8: Signing Stuff That Baby Wears 113

raining and icy. School was cancelled that day. The next day the
high was 72°F (22°C), and by the end of the week we were wearing
shorts. Such is life in southeast Texas.
Whether it’s a big, thick snow coat or a windbreaker or a raincoat,
a COAT comes in handy in many types of weather, in Texas as well
as other parts of the country. Be ready no matter what the forecast
with the sign for COAT:
1. Make two fists and place them by each shoulder like
you’re about to lift weights.
2. Pull both fists in to meet in the center of your chest, as if
you’re pulling on a coat (see Figure 8-6).
Figure 8-6: It’s freezing out there, so put your COAT on!
Mittens or gloves
A couple of years ago, my husband and I had a snow-themed birth-
day party for one of the kids. We had a great time playing with the
snow, which — because we live in Texas — we created out of pack-
ing peanuts and tossed into a kiddie pool. In addition, we created
snow pictures and tried on GLOVES. Because of the climate in
Texas, my girls didn’t remember ever wearing GLOVES before, 
and they were fascinated with the discount-store variety we gave
out as favors.
Part III: Signs for Everyday Life 
114

For those of you who, like me, live in warmer climates, I highly rec-
ommend snow-themed birthday parties for a change of pace, with
MITTENS or GLOVES as unique party favors. And then there’s
everyone else — those of you who actually live in colder climates.
Personally, I don’t know how you make it through the winter, but I
do know that you know the importance of MITTENS or GLOVES to
protect those tiny little fingers from the cold. So whether for play
or for real, when MITTENS or GLOVES are in the picture, communi-
cate to your child what they are by using this sign:
1. Place one hand, palm down, fingers spread, in front 
of you.
2. Place your other hand, palm down, fingers spread, on top
of your first hand.
3. Pull your top hand back as if you’re pulling on MITTENS
or GLOVES and then switch hands (see Figure 8-7).
Note: You can use this sign interchangeably for MITTENS
and GLOVES.
Figure 8-7: MITTENS or GLOVES are a must when it’s cold outside.

Chapter 9
Signing Animals from A to Z
In This Chapter
 Knowing the signs for your family pets
 Showing your little one the signs for farm animals
 Making your next trip to the zoo even more fun with signs
A
nimals are a big deal for babies and toddlers. Maybe the
reason is because, unlike most things in kids’ lives, many ani-
mals are actually smaller than the kids are. Or maybe it’s because
animals make strange and different noises, much like kids them-
selves. Kids see animals in books, on videos, and even in their
nursery décor. Maybe that’s where the love comes from. Who
knows? For that matter, who cares? The source of the interest isn’t
the point. What you can do with the interest is what matters.
The subject of animals presents a huge opportunity for two-way
communication between baby and you, so this chapter covers a
few signs for three different groups of common animals: pets, farm
animals, and zoo animals. I focus on common animals kids see in a
variety of settings.
Can We Have a Pet? Please,
Please, Please?
My daughter Aidan Elizabeth has always been fascinated with ani-
mals. Her parents, however, have not had the energy to take in any
animals — three babies in less than three years zaps your energy
pretty quickly — so Aidan Elizabeth has been without a family pet
all her life. Until recently. For her third birthday, a set of her grand-
parents gave her an aquarium. She was so excited. So much so that
her aquarium might even be considered the best gift she’s ever
received in her short life.

Needless to say, however, less than two weeks after receiving said
best gift she’s ever received in her short life, we were down four fish
and had to take them back to the pet store in a plastic bag. Gotta
love those life lessons. And speaking of life lessons, one of our fish
recently gave birth — to 30 fish. Yes, 30. Not a single one has had to
be flushed, so I guess we’re making up for the returned ones.
But I digress. You’ll find out sooner rather than later, if you haven’t
found out already, that pets are going to be a huge topic in your
household. To help you discuss the topic with your child, this sec-
tion covers signs for some common household pets. If you already
own one of these pets, use the sign whenever it’s around. And if
you and little dumpling are looking at a book that has one of these
animals on every page, sign away. Remember to have fun with this
topic because it’s, well, simply the cat’s meow to kids.
Dog
My daughter Aidan Elizabeth, proud new owner of her very own
aquarium and pet fish, isn’t the only animal lover in the house. My
son, Cole, loves animals just as much, and DOGS are his favorite.
We don’t own a DOG, but every time Cole hears a DOG or sees a
DOG, he signs DOG and even attempts a little bark.
When you’re making the sign for an animal, go ahead and add the
sound the animal makes. Doing so gets your child’s attention, adds
auditory stimulation, and teaches him the sound that goes with the
animal. Plus, it’s big fun, so live a little.
My advice is to follow Cole’s example: Whenever you hear a dog or
see a dog, say the word and sign away — and attempt a little bark
yourself. “Look! There’s Bobby and his DOG. Woof, woof! See the
DOG? Woof! What a pretty DOG!” Here’s the sign:
1. Tap your leg with an open hand.
2. After the tap, lift your hand and snap one time (see
Figure 9-1).
Rather intuitive, wouldn’t you say? I mean, what do you do
to get a dog to come to you? Many times you snap your fin-
gers. You’ll find that lots of ASL signs are intuitive, which
makes them easier to remember.
Part III: Signs for Everyday Life 
118

Figure 9-1: DOG-gone cute!
Cat
Like dogs, cats are popular family pets. Even if your family doesn’t
have one, chances are an immediate family member or close friend
does. When you and junior are around kitty cats, be ready to dis-
cuss them with the sign for CAT:
1. Pinch your index finger and thumb together in the ASL
sign for F (see Appendix A), leaving the rest of your fin-
gers spread apart.
2. Touch the center of your cheek with you pinched fingers
and stroke toward your ear a few times (see Figure 9-2).
Pretend you’re stroking whiskers on a cat.
Chapter 9: Signing Animals from A to Z 119

Figure 9-2: Look, a CAT! Here kitty, kitty.
Fish
It doesn’t matter where you go, you run into aquariums just about
everywhere. Our family doctor’s office has two of them. Our
favorite restaurant has three. And, of course, there’s Daughter
Dear’s aquarium at our house.
I can think of many reasons aquariums are so popular. Out in the
real world — for example, in a doctor’s office or restaurant — think
of how useful they are when you’re trying to distract a waiting
child. While showing Fidgety Britches all the interesting stuff in the
tank, say and sign the word FISH frequently. Here’s the sign:
1. Extend your hand as if you’re about to shake hands.
2. Wiggle your hand from side to side (see Figure 9-3) while
moving it forward.
Pretend your wiggling hand is a fish swimming in water.
Part III: Signs for Everyday Life 
120

Figure 9-3: FISH wish.
Bird
Before our son was born, my husband and I took our girls, Darby
and Aidan Elizabeth, to an indoor rainforest. One of the attractions
was a bright blue parrot that could squawk a blue streak (sorry,
couldn’t resist). The girls came upon the parrot, and Aidan Elizabeth
turned around and signed BIRD to her father and me. About that
time, the parrot began squawking and the girls erupted into huge
fits of giggles. What a fun way to spend the afternoon! We found out
firsthand that birds are great entertainment.
If you look outside your window or go outside to play, you’re bound
to see some type of BIRD to point out to your child. Or maybe there’s
a BIRD on a video she watches. Or, if you have a difficult time finding
BIRDS in your everyday life, go to a pet store and check out the dis-
play there. Who knows? You may come home with a family pet.
Chapter 9: Signing Animals from A to Z 121

Regardless of where you find them, the goal is to talk them up
while signing away (and simultaneously chirping or squawking).
The sign for BIRD goes like this:
1. Make a fist and extend your index finger and thumb.
2. Place the back of your hand to your chin.
3. Open and close your index finger and thumb (see 
Figure 9-4).
Yep, your fingers are representing the beak of a BIRD.
Figure 9-4: BIRDS of a feather . . .
Look Down Thar by the 
Barn and Pasture
I used to be a first-grade teacher, and I once had an entire class of
kids who grew up on concrete. The only exposure to animals most
of them ever got were the stray dogs and cats that hung around
their apartments.
As luck would have it, one of the class fieldtrips that year was to a
farm a couple of hours away from the school. What a treat it was
for me to watch those 6- and 7-year-olds experience animals and a
farm for the very first time! They rode horses, milked cows, and
fed goats. We had a great time, and I’m sure most of those kids still
have memories as vivid as the ones I have about that special day.
Part III: Signs for Everyday Life 
122

Even if your view from home is concrete in all directions and your
baby has never crawled outside the city limits, chances are that
he’s still been exposed to lots of information about farms and farm
animals, from e-i-e-i-o songs to books about various critters that
live way out by the barn and pasture. You can enhance your child’s
understanding of these critters by using the signs for them during
your conversations. This section starts you on your way with signs
for some basic farm animals: cow, horse, sheep, pig, chicken, duck,
and frog.
If you’re lucky enough to have a farm within driving distance, and 
if that farm allows visitors (especially visitors with babies in tow),
why not get a group of friends together to make the trip? The pic-
tures alone will be worth the effort. You’ll be able to introduce
your baby firsthand to various farm animals, as well as show the
signs for the animals on the spot. Then, when you get back home,
you’ll be able to reminisce and reinforce the learning experience
by looking at the photos and continuing with the signs.
Cow
Moo. Babies see COWS on ice cream and milk cartons, in animal
books, and even in fast-food restaurants occasionally. Recently, for
example, during a grand reopening of a popular chicken sandwich
chain in my neck of the woods, my kids were given stuffed COWS
to commemorate the occasion. Being the signing big sisters that
they are, the girls immediately began getting brother Cole’s atten-
tion by mooing and signing COW. Cole just laughed and laughed
and finally attempted the sign and the moo, much to the girls’ (and
their parents’) delight.
Next time you see a COW, whether in a pasture or barn, on a carton
or billboard, in a book or picture, feel free to re-create my family’s
experience at the fast-food restaurant. That is, if you don’t think
you’d feel a little out of place mooing and signing in public. Here’s
the sign for COW:
1. Make the ASL sign for the letter Y by making a fist and
then extending your thumb and pinkie finger (see
Appendix A).
2. Place your thumb to your temple (see Figure 9-5).
Picture a bull’s horn. (For those of you who may have
grown up on concrete, a bull is a male cow.) Now you’ve
got it.
Chapter 9: Signing Animals from A to Z 123

Figure 9-5: Got COWS?
Horse
Whether they have majestic wings, a magical horn, or a shimmer-
ing knight on top, horses in many storybooks are the source of
happily-ever-after dreams of children everywhere. And then there’s
the other side of the saddle. I’m talking about the farming, sport-
ing, ranching, herding, rodeoing, ten-gallon-hat-and-chaps-wearing,
horse-loving children, and there are lots of them, too. I’m from
Texas. I should know.
Whether your little horse lover is into fairytales or farms, ranches
or rodeos, have fun with your imaginations, books, and fieldtrips —
and sign the word HORSE all the while. Here’s how:
1. Make a fist and then extend your first two fingers and
thumb, fingertips pointing up.
2. Place your thumb on your head above your ear and bend
your fingers forward a couple of times (see Figure 9-6).
Yep, you’re pretending your fingers are a horse’s ears.
Part III: Signs for Everyday Life 
124

Figure 9-6: Giddy up, HORSE.
Sheep
Baa, baa, black SHEEP. My kids and I were singing this song recently
when Darby asked, “Mommy, what’s a SHEEP?” She knew the sign
for SHEEP and the sound a SHEEP makes, but she had no clue what
a SHEEP was. So I pulled out books and did some quick online
research to find pictures of SHEEP so my kids could put a picture
with the word and sound. Isn’t it funny how we assume kids know
things?
To avoid this situation with your baby, show him pictures of SHEEP
and other animals when singing about them, talking about them,
and making their various sounds. And all the while, show him the
sign too. Here’s how to make the sign for SHEEP:
1. Extend a bent arm in front of you.
2. Use the first two fingers of your other hand to create
“scissors.”
3. Move your “scissors” up and down the other arm (see
Figure 9-7).
This action mimics shearing a sheep.
Chapter 9: Signing Animals from A to Z 125

Figure 9-7: Baa, baa, black SHEEP.
Pig
Whether it’s Piglet, devoted friend of Winnie the Pooh, or Big
Mama and her babies, mud-wallowing oinkers on Grandpa Kettle’s
farm, PIGS hold a fascination for young babies and toddlers. Piglet
is fascinating thanks to the magic of great storytelling. Real pigs
are fascinating for quite a different reason. Just think about it from
a toddler’s standpoint: A PIG is a being that grunts, plays in the
mud, enjoys it, and doesn’t get in trouble for it. I sure don’t blame
little sweetie-peeties for staring at PIGS or for idolizing them if they
so desire.
So the next time you see your little one staring at a PIG, excitedly
share in her joy. Say something like “Wow! Look at that big PIG! The
PIG is playing in the mud! What a funny PIG!” and show her the sign
each time you said the magic word. Go ahead and add an oink if
you’re game — your baby will love it.
Part III: Signs for Everyday Life 
126

Here’s the sign:
1. Make the ASL sign for B by holding all four fingers of one
hand straight up, touching, while laying your thumb
against your palm (see Appendix A).
2. Place the top of your letter B hand under your chin.
3. Bend your fingers down once or twice (see Figure 9-8).
Ever heard the saying “You eat like a pig!” Your fingers are
representing a pig eating his slop (or sloppily eating, if you
prefer). I know — ewwww.
Figure 9-8: Signing PIG.
Chicken
So my oldest daughter, Darby, knew the sign for CHICKEN from
seeing various chickens at several petting zoos and on a farm trip.
That’s fine and dandy, yes, but one night we were eating CHICKEN
for dinner and my husband signed CHICKEN to our son, Cole.
Darby said, “Daddy, that’s not the sign for eating CHICKEN. That’s
the sign for CHICKENS that walk around.” Uh-oh. Awkward parent-
ing moment. Carefully, I hope, we explained to our 3-year-old how
the signs were the same and why they were the same.
Chapter 9: Signing Animals from A to Z 127

I’ve said it before, and I know I’ll say it again and again during this
long journey as a parent: Gotta love those life lessons. It’s actually
a wonder any of us ever ate CHICKEN again.
Hopefully, your baby’s introduction to the multiuse sign for
CHICKEN won’t be quite so traumatic, for him or for you. When
you’re ready, here’s the sign for CHICKEN. Cluck it up:
1. Cup one hand in front of your body, palm facing up.
2. Make the sign for BIRD with your other hand.
3. Move your extended fingers to the center of your other
palm and tap your hand a few times (see Figure 9-9).
The movement is reminiscent of a CHICKEN pecking the
ground.
Figure 9-9: Eat more CHICKEN.
Duck
I know, I know. You can see DUCKS at your local park and at the
zoo, not just down on the farm. In fact, one of my family’s favorite
pastimes is feeding the DUCKS at a nearby pond. That pond is
where my husband and I went to show our kids what DUCKS really
are — not just vague beings from funny songs or floating plastic
bath toys. It’s also where Aidan Elizabeth signed DUCK for the first
Part III: Signs for Everyday Life 
128

time (also one of her first words, by the way). I guess it’s safe to
say ducks are a pretty big deal at my house.
Whatever your occasion — whether feeding live ducks at the
farm/park/pond/zoo or singing a ducky song, reading a ducky
book, or playing with a rubber ducky in the bath (the sign for
BATH is in Chapter 7, by the way) — use the occasion to introduce
the sign, have a good time, and add a “quack, quack” for good
measure.
Here’s the sign for DUCK:
1. Make the sign for BIRD (refer to Figure 9-4, earlier in this
chapter.)
2. Add your middle finger beside your index finger (see
Figure 9-10).
The movement imitates a duck’s bill.
Figure 9-10: Rubber DUCKY, you’re the one.
Frog
Last summer, several FROGS decided to camp out by my back
door. I don’t know why. Of course, Aidan Elizabeth was fascinated
and wanted to follow them around. One night, we brought a flash-
light outside and followed a FROG around the patio, signing FROG
the whole time. When the FROG hopped off into the yard (no doubt
to get away from the shrieks of glee), Aidan Elizabeth followed it,
Chapter 9: Signing Animals from A to Z 129

bare feet and all, shouting, “Come back FROGGY! I love you!” She
signed and yelled those words over and over again as her father
and I keeled over from laughter. It’s a memory we’ll never forget.
Hopefully, you and your little one will have an opportunity to see
and chase live FROGS sometime, but even if Kermit ends up being
the only FROG your baby gets exposed to, use said Muppet as an
opportunity to introduce the sign for FROG. Here it is:
1. Place a fist under your chin.
2. Move your first two fingers out and in several times, with
your thumb catching the fingers on the in movement (see
Figure 9-11).
The movement is mimicking a bullFROG’s chin area blow-
ing up as it makes its sound.

Fieldtrip! A Day at the Zoo
A day at the zoo can be fantastic fun for all involved, if you’re up to
walking your legs off and stepping through a smelly area or two. I
say this from direct experience. Last summer on a bright, sunshiny
day in May, my best friend and her daughter, my girls, my mother,
and I headed out for the local zoo. We walked and walked and
walked. The first thing my girls saw were some stuffed monkeys at
a shop, and they immediately jumped out of the wagon to go play
with them. I headed toward the shop to deposit the girls straight
back in the wagon, but my mom beat me there and started to play
Part III: Signs for Everyday Life 
130

with the girls and the monkeys. Great. Like we needed more stuffed
animals at our house. But being the Master Mother she is, my mom
actually coaxed the girls away from the shop without purchasing a
monkey and without a screaming fit from either child. I view this as
nothing short of a miracle.
Of course, we went directly to the monkey area (smelly area #1)
where the girls enjoyed acting like monkeys the whole time. They
signed MONKEY and made monkey noises through the rest of the
zoo. At the elephant area (smelly area #2), they signed ELEPHANT,
trumpeted, and then went back to being monkeys. At the lion’s den
(interestingly, smelly area not so much), they signed LION and
roared a bit, and then went back to being monkeys. Same thing
when we saw the tigers, bears, and alligators. Yet we still didn’t go
home with a stuffed monkey. Go figure.
Next time you take your bundle of love to the zoo, have a few
animal signs in your back pocket. The signs will help keep your
kids (and others) entertained throughout the whole zoo trip. This
section can get you started by providing signs for a few common
zoo animals.
Monkey
My family recently went to a monkey-themed birthday party. We
had bananas with a monkey-shaped cake. Too cute. The party
favor was a 2-foot-tall blow-up monkey. We brought home three of
them. My daughters buckled their monkeys into the spare car seat
in our van. Son Cole just wouldn’t let go of his monkey. When we
got home, the monkeys disappeared into the toy room until the
next morning. Cole found his monkey and started carrying it
around, holding it by the hand. The next time I saw him, Cole had
his arms around the monkey and was giving it hugs and kisses.
Aren’t kids hilarious?
Next time you’re around a monkey — real or toy — make a big deal
of the situation by pretending you’re a monkey, jumping around and
making monkey noises. Of course, this activity may be better
suited for you dads out there, to whom it may come a bit more nat-
urally. Whichever of you is willing to embarrass yourself in front of
other people is the best one to demonstrate, but don’t forget to
make the sign for MONKEY while you do it:
1. Place the fingertips of both hands at your waist.
2. Move your fingertips up to your armpits.
3. Repeat several times (see Figure 9-12).
Chapter 9: Signing Animals from A to Z 131

Figure 9-12: Let’s MONKEY around, baby.
Lion
There’s nothing more royal than a lion perched on a rock looking
disinterested in everything around it. Sort of like your baby when
he’s not interested in shopping but can’t find a reason to fuss about
it yet. When you’re around lions next time, show your sweetie pie
the sign for LION while making a big roar. It’s guaranteed to get his
attention.
Here’s the sign for LION:
1. Rest your hand on top of your head with your fingertips
facing forward at your forehead.
2. Pull your hand back and down to the back of your neck
(see Figure 9-13).
Your hand is representing a lion’s mane as you make 
this sign.
Part III: Signs for Everyday Life 
132

Figure 9-13: Roar, LION, roar.
Tiger
Tigers always seem restless to me. Every time I see tigers, they
seem to be impatiently walking around whatever habitat they’re in,
sort of the way my husband paced while I was in labor.
Anyway, next time you glimpse a tiger pacing at the zoo, or watch a
video of Tigger bouncing through the Hundred Acre Wood, have fun
with the TIGER sign. Bonus: It’s also great for a game of peek-a-boo.
1. Open your fingers and loosely lace them together, palms
facing your body.
2. Place your loosely laced fingers at your nose.
3. Pull your hands apart, toward your ears (see Figure 9-14).
Your hands are representing stripes on a tiger’s face.
Elephant
Elephants hold massive fascination for most people, especially if
you’re under 3 feet tall and drink from a sippy cup. ELEPHANT was
one of my daughter Aidan Elizabeth’s first signs. Her aunt and
uncle gave her a stuffed elephant, which she loved immensely and
took everywhere we went.
Chapter 9: Signing Animals from A to Z 133

Figure 9-14: TIGER, raah!
Whether your child’s first experience is with a real elephant or a
stuffed one, the sign is the same. Don’t forget to make a trumpeting
sound as you’re making the sign:
1. Place the back of your hand at your nose and mouth area.
2. Move your hand out and up, like you’re outlining an ele-
phant’s trunk (see Figure 9-15).
Figure 9-15: ELEPHANT, schmelephant.

134

Alligator
As parents, we sing about alligators, read about alligators, and see
them at the zoo. We even take care of our own little alligators
during teething and biting times. During any and all of these activi-
ties, take the time to say and sign ALLIGATOR to keep your baby in
the know. (By the way, you can use the same sign for ALLIGATOR
and CROCODILE.)
Here’s the sign:
1. Curve your fingers on both hands and place them
together at the fingertips.
2. Open and close your hands several times and don’t forget
to make a menacing face all the while (see Figure 9-16).
Your hands are resembling an ALLIGATOR’S bite.

M
ore than any other place in the whole wide world, my son
Cole loves to go outside. It doesn’t matter if the weather is
hot, cold, rainy, or in between; he’ll head out the door faster than a
jackrabbit if we happen to leave it accessible. Maybe Cole likes the
feeling of the hot sun or the cool wind, or maybe he just likes the
fresh air or the extra room to run. Who knows? There’s just some-
thing about going outside that floats his boat. (Pun intended.)
Many babies and toddlers feel the same way Cole does and share
the same enthusiasm for going outside. And that’s precisely the
reason for this chapter. Here, I cover various signs you can use
with your baby as you explore the great outdoors together.
C’mon, Baby, Take a Ride with Me
We all do it: transport ourselves continually from point A to point
B. And as you know, there are numerous ways to get the job done.
Sorting out what’s what in modes of transportation can be hard for
a baby. Signing can help your little sweetheart learn the difference
between trains, planes, and, yes, automobiles.
Car
For a long time, my son Cole insisted on calling anything with
wheels a BALL (see the nearby sidebar for details). We finally got
through that mix-up, and now he insists that everything with
wheels that moves is a CAR. Our van is a CAR, his sisters’ bicycles
are CARS, the garbage truck is a CAR, the red wagon in our back-
yard is a CAR, and even his stroller is a CAR.

It’s a start.
Whether you’re referring specifically to a car or to any other vehi-
cle that has wheels and moves, sign the word CAR to aid your com-
munication. “Do you want to take a ride in the CAR? Let’s get in the
CAR and go to the park! The CAR will take us there!” Here’s the sign
for CAR:
1. Make two fists in front of you as if you’re holding a steer-
ing wheel.
2. Move your hands up and down a few times as if you’re
turning a steering wheel (see Figure 10-1).
Figure 10-1: Vroom, vroom. . . . Riding in the CAR.
By the way, I mention the word BALL in my story about Cole and
his wheel confusion, and you may be wondering what the sign for
BALL is. Mosey on over to the “Big Fun at the Community Park”
section later in this chapter to find out.
Airplane
In my family, going to see some of the grandparents is an extremely
long drive. Granted, without children the drive isn’t so bad, but
add my three kids to the mix and I’d rather be nearly anywhere
else in the world than in the family van.
Part III: Signs for Everyday Life 
138

Now if my family flies to see the grandparents, we’ve got two things
going for us:
 The sheer novelty of an airplane ride: The unique experi-
ence distracts my kids almost the entire flight and keeps them
from screaming.
 The extreme shortened “together time” in an enclosed
space: As long as someone doesn’t poop in a diaper or train-
ing pants, we’re good to go.
If you’re planning to travel on one of those fabulous, shortened-
together-time-in-an-enclosed-space, sanity-saving airplanes any
time soon, start using the sign for AIRPLANE to get your baby in
the know. And even if you’re planning to keep your feet firmly on
the ground, you can use the sign when your baby hears or sees a
plane overhead.
Here’s the sign for AIRPLANE:
1. Make the I LOVE YOU sign by extending your thumb,
index finger, and pinky of one hand 
(see Chapter 4).
2. Starting around your shoulder, move your I LOVE YOU
hand up and over your head to the other shoulder (see
Figure 10-2).
Chapter 10: Signing in the Great Outdoors 139
The wheels on the bus 
go ’round and ’round
While riding in the van one time, my son Cole signed and said BALL when there was
no ball in sight. Following his glance, I realized he was referring to the wheels on a
nearby vehicle. I affirmed that the wheels were the shape of a BALL, but I explained
that the circles were actually wheels that go on a CAR. Cole continued to insist 
BALL — and continued to do so for a very long time. Oh well. To him BALL made
sense, and eventually I did get him to put two and two — wheel and CAR —
together.
Going off on a side road here, one reason I think kids like vehicles so much is that
wheels going ’round and ’round are hypnotic, and the rumble of engines is calming.
Doesn’t matter to me what the cause is; who am I to argue with anything that keeps
my kids still, and maybe even quiet, for a few minutes?

Figure 10-2: Way up high AIRPLANE.
Bicycle
For her fourth birthday, my daughter Darby wanted nothing more
than a pink bicycle with a backpack and water-bottle holder. Well,
some of the grandparents indulged, and we now have a pink bicy-
cle with a backpack and water-bottle holder in our garage. Darby’s
sister and brother think the bicycle is just as wonderful as Darby
does, even though they’re too small to ride it. Luckily, the sign for
BICYCLE can also be used for a tricycle, a push toy, and a scooter,
all of which are also in our garage and deemed wonderful by
Darby’s sister and brother.
Whether your go-go-go-getter rides a bike or a trike, or pushes a
toy or a scooter, feel free to use the sign for BICYCLE to communi-
cate what she’s doing. Here’s the sign for BICYCLE:
1. Make two fists and place them close together in front of
your body, palms down.
2. Rotate your fists as if they’re pushing the pedals on a
bicycle (see Figure 10-3).
Part III: Signs for Everyday Life 
140

Figure 10-3: I like to ride my BICYCLE.
Train
Depending on where you live, TRAINS can be an important part of
travel for your family. That’s not the case in my neck of the woods,
though, so my kids’ experience with trains is limited to books,
videos, and the local zoo. Additionally, my mom recently bought
the kids wooden train whistles, so we also play train all over our
house and actually whistle for passengers to board. Thanks, Mom.
We’re bringing the whistles to your house next time we visit so we
can all have big fun.
When and if you’re ready to play train with a real whistle at your
house, I’ve actually seen train whistles in the toy section of the
dollar store. Consider making it an outside game. And be sure to
sign the word TRAIN all the while.
Chapter 10: Signing in the Great Outdoors 141

Likewise, if you use a TRAIN as a mode of transportation for your
family, sign TRAIN when you’re leaving the house, while you’re
waiting at the station, and when you’re actually on the TRAIN.
Same goes if you have a child with a TRAIN fascination — sign
away while looking at train books or videos. Here’s the sign:
1. Form two ASL letter Hs by making two fists and extend-
ing the first two fingers of both hands (see Appendix A).
2. Place the fingertips of one H hand at the knuckle of the
other H hand.
3. Move your fingertips back and forth on the fingers of the
second hand (see Figure 10-4).
This movement mimics a TRAIN on railroad tracks.
Figure 10-4: Chugga chugga choo choo TRAIN!
Boat
One set of my kids’ grandparents has a beach house on the coast in
Galveston, Texas. The house is actually on one of the canals that
eventually feeds into Galveston Bay. Needless to say, my kids love
going to Pampu and GranJan’s beach house, especially since last
summer when they were first introduced to their grandparents’ boat.
What an experience for them! Between feeling the wind whip their
hair and seeing the fish jump out of the water, my kids were abso-
lutely thrilled with their first boat ride. And to think, prior to that day,
they thought the sign for BOAT was limited to floating bathtub toys.
Part III: Signs for Everyday Life 
142

Look for ways to incorporate the sign for BOAT into your child’s
repertoire. Use the sign with any type of boat (row, paddle, speed,
pontoon, ferry, and so on), whether it’s real, on a video, or in the
bathtub. (You may also want to have some companion signs in
your back pocket. For example, the signs for SPLASH and BATH are
in Chapter 7, and the sign for FISH is in Chapter 9.)
Here’s the BOAT sign:
1. Cup your hands together, pinky sides touching and
thumb sides open.
Your cupped hands represent a BOAT.
2. Move your hands up and down a bit (see Figure 10-5).
This movement represents a BOAT floating on water.
Chapter 10: Signing in the Great Outdoors 143
The magnificent train under the ground
A friend of mine, Beryt, and her son Josh, a proficient signing baby, were in a city
with a subway, and Beryt realized that Josh was fascinated with the subway. Being
the fabulous signing mom she is, Beryt took advantage of the situation. She showed
Josh the sign for SUBWAY, right then and there. Because Beryt and her family don’t
live near a subway, and she knew they were headed for a city with a subway, she
had looked the sign up ahead of time – just in case. Brilliant, isn’t she? Feel free to
follow her lead. She’ll be thrilled to have inspired you.
So what do you do if you come across a situation and you don’t know an appropri-
ate sign? If you don’t have the time or energy to look up signs before you go some-
where, use the signs you already know to your advantage. For example, instead of
the sign for SUBWAY, you could show your fascinated baby that a subway is a
TRAIN that goes UNDER the ground.
I cover the sign for TRAIN in the aptly named “Train” section of this chapter. Here’s
the cut-to-the-chase info for signing UNDER:
1. Place one hand at chest level, in a closed-5 hand shape (see Chapter 3), 
palm down.
2. Make an ASL A (see Appendix A) with the other hand, and place it above (but
not touching) your closed-5 hand.
3. Move the A hand from the top of the closed-5 hand to below the closed-5 hand.

Figure 10-5: Row, row, row your BOAT. . . .
Moods of Mother Nature
Weather can have a profound effect on a child’s (and a parent’s)
day. Rain or cold weather can put a damper on outside plans.
Where I live, in southeast Texas, summertime heat forces my
family indoors much more often than wintertime cold. Guess that’s
what we get for living here.
Next time Mother Nature throws your outside plans to the wind
(pardon the pun) and you have to tell your little sweetie she can’t
go outside today, give her a reason with a sign. This section pro-
vides three basic signs to get you started: RAIN, SNOW, and WIND.
Note, too, that you can use HOT and COLD to explain Mother
Nature’s mood. Those signs are covered in Chapter 6.
Rain
Rain, rain, go away, come again another day. This is a favorite 
song of my kids, especially when it’s raining but even when it’s not.
Because my girls have raincoats, umbrellas, and rain boots, Darby
Part III: Signs for Everyday Life 
144

and Aidan Elizabeth both think that every time it rains, they can go
outside. Mentioning that the ground is too wet or that they might
get wet is completely futile. “We won’t get wet, Mommy. We’ll wear
our raincoats and rain boots, and we’ll use our umbrellas while we
splash in the puddles. We’ll stay dry.” Sure. Gotta love preschool
logic.
When there’s a rainstorm brewing outside your home, or when you
catch a few drops while dashing to or from a store, show your baby
how to sign RAIN. And while you’re at it, sing a song about RAIN.
Here’s the sign:
1. Start with your hands open, palms down, fingers slightly
curved, lifted above your head.
2. Bring your hands down, in short bounces, without wig-
gling your fingers (see Figure 10-6).
Figure 10-6: RAIN, RAIN, go away. . . .
Snow
The last time it snowed in Houston, Texas, was Christmas Eve 2004.
Before that, I think 1989 was the last time it snowed in Houston. I
may be wrong on that date, but either way, snow is a rather big deal
in my neck of the woods. That particular Christmas Eve was the
first time my children had ever seen real snow, and my girls were
absolutely thrilled. My son, however, was only 2 months old and
couldn’t have cared less.
Chapter 10: Signing in the Great Outdoors 145

Some of you are probably the complete opposite of my family. You
see snow as much as or more than we see rain. If so, talk frequently
about the snow with your child and use the sign to help him under-
stand all that white stuff surrounding him. And while you’re at it,
sign that when it snows, that means it’s COLD outside (see Chapter 6
for the sign for COLD). And if you live in a climate like mine, the sign
is still great to use because even if the snow is just in picture books
or on holiday cards, it holds big delight for children of all ages.
Here’s the SNOW sign:
1. Start with your hands open, palms down, fingers slightly
curved, lifted above your head.
Note: This hand position is also the beginning step when
making the RAIN sign (see the preceding section).
2. Move your hands down, just as when signing RAIN, but
wiggle your fingers instead of keeping them still (see
Figure 10-7).
Figure 10-7: Let it SNOW, let it SNOW, let it SNOW!
Wind
The area of the country my family lives in sometimes experiences
massive destruction from wind due to hurricanes and tropical
storms. Add those destructive types of wind to the normal gentle
Part III: Signs for Everyday Life 
146

breezes that just cause the trees to sway, as well as the circulating
breezes of continually running ceiling fans, and my kids have tons
of opportunities to sign WIND.
You don’t have to live in the hot, hot South or hurricane-prone
areas or Tornado Alley to find opportunities to sign WIND. Great
times to show your sweetie peetie the sign are when you’re at the
park feeling the wind on your face or when you’re watching a tree
or crops in a field move with the wind.
Any time she can actually feel or see what you’re signing is a fan-
tastic teachable moment because you’re showing her a way to
communicate whatever she happens to be interested in at the
time. Here’s the sign for WIND:
1. Extend your hands, palms facing each other, in front of
your body.
2. Move your hands and arms back and forth as if the WIND
is blowing them (see Figure 10-8).
Figure 10-8: She’s like the WIND. . . .
Chapter 10: Signing in the Great Outdoors 147

Look! Up in the Sky!
One of the most important things children have taught me through
the years, and especially my own children in recent years, is to
look up. Children look up and down and all around while adults
tend to simply look in the direction they’re going (not bad to do,
mind you, especially when you’re driving). As an upshot of all their
looking is that children tend to notice things adults miss, like a
sleek airplane, a colorful bird, or a wealth of twinkling stars.
Take a moment, assuming you’re not driving or walking right now,
and look up. See what you may be missing. If you see a sleek plane,
excitedly point at it and make the sign (covered earlier in this chap-
ter). Same goes if you spot a colorful bird (see Chapter 9 for the sign-
ing details). Do you see the sun, moon, stars? Read on for the signs.
Sun
Looking up into the sun isn’t a good thing to do. Usually, the only
time I even notice the sun is when someone points out a sunset.
My girls love to show me the sunset and their favorite colors in the
sky. Darby and Aidan Elizabeth’s favorite colors at the moment are
purple and pink, respectively. (You can find color signs in
Appendix C, if you’re interested.)
Signing and singing together is a great way to introduce signs to
your child and to reinforce signs you and your little one have
learned or are learning. For example, you can sing a song about 
the sun and make the sign for SUN each time you sing the word. 
In addition to signing SUN while singing about it, you can sign 
SUN when showing your child a picture of the sun or sharing a
sunset or sunrise together. Any of these modes are perfect for 
signing SUN.
Here’s the sign:
1. Make a flat-O hand shape (see Chapter 3) by first forming
an O with your fingers and thumb and then flattening
them out so that it looks like a deflated balloon, and have
your fingertips pointing down.
2. Using your fingertips as a writing utensil, draw a circle in
the air.
You’re drawing the sun here.
Part III: Signs for Everyday Life 
148

3. Open your fingers so that your palm is facing the floor
(see Figure 10-9).
The open fingers facing down represent the sun’s rays shin-
ing down.
Figure 10-9: Mr. SUN, please shine down on me!
Moon
Much safer to look at than the sun, the moon is a great source of
fascination for my kids. While riding in the van recently, my 4-year-
old, Darby, shouted at the top of her lungs, “Look, Mom! The moon
is a C tonight!”
At that point, her younger sister, Aidan Elizabeth, showed baby
brother Cole the sign for MOON. “Look, Cole, this is the sign for
MOON.” Gotta love those signing siblings.
Some fantastic books about the moon are available for young chil-
dren, and some are even in board-book format to lengthen their
durability. I have one board book about the moon that’s on its
third child. Talk about a lasting investment!
Chapter 10: Signing in the Great Outdoors 149

Anyway, when you’re looking at a book that shows a picture of 
the moon, or when you’re riding in the car and see the moon (and
someone else is driving), or when your baby looks at the moon and
signs BALL (which I cover later in this chapter), show her the sign
for MOON:
1. Make a C hand shape with one hand (see Appendix A).
2. Place the C hand shape at your eye.
3. Keeping the C hand shape, move your hand up above
your head (see Figure 10-10).
This movement represents looking up at the moon.
Figure 10-10: Hey diddle diddle . . . the cow jumped over the MOON.
Stars
Singing about twinkling stars is one of my daughter Aidan
Elizabeth’s favorite pastimes. It may stem from the fact that big sis
Darby used to sing the song to her when Aidan Elizabeth was a
baby. Consequently, every time Aidan Elizabeth sees a crying baby,
she goes over to the baby and sings “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star.”
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t, but I absolutely applaud
the effort.
Part III: Signs for Everyday Life 
150

When you sing about twinkling stars to your shining star, or if you
happen to live in a place where you can actually see stars in the
night sky, show her the STAR sign. Here it is:
1. Extend your index fingers on both hands and place them
side by side, fingertips pointing up.
2. Alternating fingers, move one finger higher than the
other several times (see Figure 10-11).
Imagine you’re counting the STARS in the sky, one by one.
Figure 10-11: Twinkle, twinkle, little STAR.
Big Fun at the Community Park
Several community parks are near my house, and my family enjoys
visiting and picnicking at them on a regular basis. We always have
a blast on the swings and slides, and my kids love the chance to
see friends there and to cool off under a big shade tree. As a side
note, we have some of the same playground equipment (and more)
in our backyard, and my girls have begun affectionately calling our
backyard Watson World. Must’ve heard that one from their daddy.
Maybe you and yours have a nearby park or a roomy backyard to
enjoy. When you’re catching your bundle of energy at the end of
Chapter 10: Signing in the Great Outdoors 151

the slide or pushing her in the swing, show her the signs for what-
ever you’re doing and then ask her if she wants MORE (the sign for
MORE is in Chapter 5).
Play
You can use the sign for PLAY in a wide variety of settings, such as
at the park or at the house or anywhere else baby is feeling playful.
To introduce the sign for PLAY, say something like “I wonder what
you want to PLAY with today. Do you want to PLAY with your BALL
or your CAR today?” or “Let’s PLAY together. How about we PLAY
peek-a-boo? Where’s BABY?” (I cover the signs for BALL and CAR
in this chapter, and I cover the sign for BABY in Chapter 4.)
However you decide to use it, the sign for PLAY is a great way to
communicate fun to your baby. Here’s how to make the sign:
1. Make the ASL letter Y with both hands, palms facing your
body (see appendix A).
To form the letter Y, make a fist and then extend your
thumb and pinkie finger.
2. Shake both hands a few times in a PLAYful manner (see
Figure 10-12).
Figure 10-12: Wanna PLAY?
Part III: Signs for Everyday Life 
152

Ball
So you’re planning an afternoon at the park and trying to decide
whether you should pack anything more than a diaper bag, a big
blanket to drape across the grass, and a bag of snacks and sippy
drinks. Well, consider that parks usually have wide open spaces . . .
and lots of children. Sounds like a great opportunity to play with a
big, bouncy ball.
Whether you’re taking your big, bouncy ball to the park or your
own backyard, let junior know he’s in for big fun by saying and
signing what’s going on. Here’s the sign for BALL:
1. Using loose open hands, face your palms toward each
other, roughly shoulder-width apart.
2. Pull your hands out and bounce them back in a few times
as if you’re holding a ball (see Figure 10-13).
Figure 10-13: Bouncy, bouncy BALL!
Swing
Ahh, the power of a swing. When Aidan Elizabeth was a baby, I’m
not sure my husband and I would’ve survived without a baby swing.
Sometimes the swing was the only thing that calmed her fussy little
Chapter 10: Signing in the Great Outdoors 153

self down. Even now, all three of my kids would be content to spend
the entire day being pushed on the backyard or playground swing.
If you happen to have a fussy baby or toddler at your house, try
the swing. If she’s old enough to understand, try to distract her
from crying by suggesting and signing that she and you go outside
to play on the swing. Now, please don’t mention going outside to
play on the swing if you don’t have time to actually follow through.
That’s opening up a whole new can of worms. But if you’ve got the
time, this tactic is definitely worth a shot.
And, of course, say and sign SWING on non-fussy occasions, too.
When spending quality time with your sweetie at the park or in
your own backyard, feel free to sign away. Here’s how:
1. Make a C with one hand (see Appendix A).
2. Hook the first two fingers of your other hand over the
thumb of your C hand.
3. Now move your hands forward and back as if they were
a swing (see Figure 10-14).
Figure 10-14: SWING me higher, Daddy!
Slide
One of the things my girls love to do is make “trains” as they’re
sliding down a slide. An extra-fun element is added when little
Part III: Signs for Everyday Life 
154

brother joins them. Whipping through the air down a slide is usu-
ally big fun no matter what, but adding extra people for a “train”
takes big fun through the roof.
At the park or in your own backyard, say and sign SLIDE whenever
your little darling is getting ready to take the plunge. Here’s the
sign for SLIDE:
1. Extend one hand, palm up.
2. With the other hand, make an ASL V by extending your
first two fingers (see Appendix A).
3. Now bend those fingers, and turn your palm face up.
4. Place the back of your bent-V hand at the heel of your
other hand’s open palm and move the bent-V hand forward
quickly, sliding it on your open palm (see Figure 10-15).
Figure 10-15: SLIDE . . . whee!
The Wonders of Your 
Own Backyard
Any time they’re outside, kids tend to notice more things than
adults do. I can’t tell you how many times one of my kids has made
an excited yelp and shown me ants in the dirt or a bird in the tree
that I had been totally oblivious to.
Chapter 10: Signing in the Great Outdoors 155

When you take your little one to your backyard or on a walk through
your neighborhood, tune in to the wonders he points out to you.
And go ahead and show him the sign for whatever he’s interested in.
This section covers signs for three items that are common to most
backyards: trees, flowers, and good old-fashioned, fun-to-play-in dirt.
Trees
You can climb in them, they provide cool shade on hot sunny days,
and they add beauty to their surroundings. And trees are an easy
focal point for children due to the sheer height difference between
the two. Anything towering over a young’un is sure to catch her
attention.
Next time you see your child staring at tree branches or seeking
shelter from the blazing sun under a shady tree, show her the sign
for TREE:
1. Place the elbow of one arm on the hand of the other.
Your elbow represents the base of a tree; your arm, the
trunk; and your fingers, the branches.
2. Using the arm that’s representing a tree, twist your hand
at the wrist a few times (see Figure 10-16).
This action represents the movement of tree branches.
Flower
As a parent, one of the sweetest joys in my life is when my girls
bring me flowers that they find growing outside. They always say,
“I love you,” when they hand me a flower. In those sweet moments,
it’s difficult for me to remember why they sometimes drive me
crazy. Of course, I’m quickly reminded just how crazy they can
drive me when I realize the flowers they just brought me are from a
flower bed I’ve been slaving over.
Part III: Signs for Everyday Life 
156

Figure 10-16: TREE, wonderful TREE!
The next time your child notices a flower in your backyard or
brings you one from the very flower bed you’ve been slaving over
all summer long, smile and show him the sign for FLOWER. “Oooh,
what a pretty FLOWER! Let’s smell the pretty FLOWER and put the
FLOWER in a vase with WATER!” You can find the sign for WATER in
Chapter 7, and you can find the sign for FLOWER right here:
1. Using a flat-O hand shape (see Chapter 3), place your fin-
gertips to the right of your nose.
2. Move your hand in an arc around to the left so that your
fingertips are touching the left side of your nose (see
Figure 10-17).
Imagine you’re smelling a flower, first with your right nos-
tril and then with your left.
Chapter 10: Signing in the Great Outdoors 157

Figure 10-17: Mmmm, a sweet-smelling FLOWER.
Dirt
Eventually, you’ll experience it with your baby or toddler. Every
parent I know has at least one child who has tasted dirt. Yummy.
Both of my girls have tried dirt as a matter of experimentation.
However, my son has been caught several times shoving dirt in his
mouth. He always grins widely, showing the dirt among his teeth,
and signs DIRT for his parents. He just wants us to be proud. Oh,
well, I guess there are worse things. . . .
You can find DIRT just about everywhere you go, including your
own backyard. And it can be the bane of your existence if you have
hard floors in your house and active, outdoorsy children. Out and
in, out and in, tracking up the floors again.
If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em. In other words, if you find your little
one fascinated by DIRT, show her the sign and show her how to
make dust in the wind. Or a mud pie. With any luck, she won’t eat
it. Here’s the sign for DIRT:
1. Make the flat-O hand shape with both hands (see 
Chapter 3), palms up.
2. Rub your fingertips with your thumbs (see Figure 10-18).
Imagine you have dusty dirt falling through your hands.

Now We’re Talking

In this part . . .
W
hen you and your baby have a solid set of signs
under your belt, you may begin to wonder, “Where
do we go from here?” Or perhaps, after baby begins to
talk, you may wonder, “Do I go anywhere from here? Or is
it time to quit signing?”
The decisions you make are a matter of personal choice.
However, as the mother of three signing children, and as 
a former teacher, I have strong feelings on this subject. 
On the basis of these feelings, I have a heartfelt request:
Please keep signing with your little one, even when she’s
no longer a baby. I explain why in this part: The beneﬁts of
continued signing are worth the effort. In addition, I intro-
duce sign combinations, the baby-signing equivalent to
sentences. I also answer some common questions about
struggles and stumbling blocks you may encounter along
the baby-signing journey.

Chapter 11
Signing Sentences
In This Chapter
 Knowing what sign sentences are
 Figuring out whether, when, and how to use them
 Getting going with a few examples
W
hen I was pregnant with my first child, I was looking at a
friend’s scrapbook of her 21⁄2-year-old, Megan, and I laughed
out loud when I got to the page commemorating Megan’s first sen-
tence, “I sum gapes.” (Those without small children know this sen-
tence as “I want some grapes.”) Megan made this statement while
she was standing outside the refrigerator and attempting to open
it. Beyond thinking it was cute, I thought, “Holy cow! This mile-
stone hadn’t even occurred to me.”
To this day, I still haven’t scrapbooked any of my three children’s
milestones (although I’ve had lofty intentions), but I do recall all
three of my children’s first sign sentences. Whether you’re a scrap-
booking parent or not, among the treasured memories you’ll cher-
ish of your signing baby will be his first signed sentence.
What’s a Sign Sentence?
More than one sign within a few seconds is essentially a signed
sentence — but in this sense, the term sentence is used loosely.
Just as “I sum gapes” constitutes a sentence for a toddler, so do
the signed words EAT MORE or PLAY BALL.
Just as you wouldn’t expect a toddler’s sentence to be grammatically
correct (like “May I please have some grapes?”), don’t expect your
baby to sign, “I would like to eat more food, please.” In other words,
don’t expect your baby to sign every word of the sentence he’s trying
to communicate. (That’s not how American Sign Language works
anyway.) Instead, watch for and model for baby the use of any two
or more signs together to express a single desire or thought.

Signing sentences will occur naturally in conversations with your
baby, but that’s not to say you should start out with sign sentences.
Over time your signing conversations with your baby will evolve to
this point. When you and baby have developed a large enough sign
vocabulary to consider combining signs to make a sentence, it’s
probably time to start trying.
Is Signing Sentences 
Really a Big Deal?
You may be wondering, “What’s so important about sign sentences?”
Your baby can sign EAT, and she can sign MORE. Why should you
be excited if she signs EAT MORE?
Consider verbal communication: My friend instinctively recognized
her daughter’s ability to say “I sum gapes” as a developmental leap
from what she had done previously, which was to stand in front of
the refrigerator, pointing, grunting, and screaming “Gape!” The abil-
ity to string words together in a meaningful way is a step forward
in communication, be it verbal or signed. For a baby, the ability to
express her thoughts with more than one word or sign indicates
that her brain is developing — and so are her abilities to think,
understand, and communicate.
Communication is an evolving skill. None of us is born quoting
Shakespeare. (In fact, some of us never quite get there, thank you
very much.) We begin with monosyllabic tones (think Tim Allen’s
caveman impression on Home Improvement), step up to intelligible
singular words, move ahead to broken sentences, and then eventu-
ally (if our eighth-grade grammar teacher is at all successful) learn
proper sentence structure. As the parent of a signing baby, you can
celebrate baby’s first sign sentence (which will probably come along
long before her first sentence) for exactly what it is: a true milestone
in her growth and development, whether you scrapbook it or not.
So When and How Do I Begin?
Know up front that sign sentences are not a starting point. This is
one of the few chapters in this book that expects you and baby to
have some previous signing under your belts. If you’re just starting to
sign with your baby and you’ve turned to this chapter as a jumping-
in point, come back later. For now, refer to the book’s Introduction
for suggestions on where to begin. If you’ve already tried your hand
at some other chapters and you and your baby are signing a bit, stay
Part IV: Now We’re Talking 
164

right here — and congratulations on the progress you and baby
have made so far!
Now that baby has a few signs in his vocabulary, begin to consider
which of these signs might go together to form sentences. If baby
doesn’t know it yet, this would be a great time to introduce the
sign for MORE (see Chapter 5 or the following section), because
MORE can be used with many other signs to form meaningful sign
sentences. After you’ve identified the possible sign combinations
within baby’s sign vocabulary, begin to use these sentences with
baby in the appropriate contexts. For example, if baby is restless at
the dinner table, use your signs to ask if he wants to EAT MORE, or
if he is FINISHED and wants to PLAY. (Check out the following sec-
tion for various sign-sentence examples so you can get a good feel
for when and how to do it.)
Now remember, you’re entering a new stage in baby’s signed com-
munication. Just as you didn’t expect him to sign back to you that
first day, don’t expect him to begin signing sentences right away.
The general rules for signing with baby apply to combining signs
with baby: focus on only a few sentences, look for the right time to
use them, and be consistent. Take heart: At this point your baby is
probably already thinking in sentences, so it won’t be long before
he’s signing them.
Looking at a Few Sign Sentences
Obviously, signs — just like words — can be combined in a limit-
less number of ways. However, among signing babies, I’ve
observed a few common sign-sentence families. I cover some of
them in this section and hope you find them helpful.
The sign-sentence families presented in this chapter are generaliza-
tions, and they’re far from being all-inclusive. In fact, many sign
sentences defy all attempts at classification. I’m sure you and your
baby will come up with many original sign sentences together.
MORE sentences
The sign MORE can go with many, many, many different things.
Case in point: The first sign sentence from Aidan Elizabeth, my
second child, was MORE ELEPHANT. Although my home often
resembles a zoo, I’ve never seen any elephants running around, so
this one took a while to figure out. In the end, Aidan Elizabeth
wanted to watch more of a zoo video that features elephants.
Chapter 11: Signing Sentences 165

Likewise, your baby’s first sign sentence may well be MORE com-
bined with something she really loves.
For a practical example from this family of sign sentences, con-
sider the sign sentence MORE BUBBLES. If your little one signs this
sentence, she might mean your bubble machine needs refilling or
you just need to blow faster.
To make this sign sentence, follow these steps:
1. Using both hands, make two flat-O hand shapes (see
Chapter 3).
2. Repeatedly touch the fingertips of both hands (see the
top illustration in Figure 11-1).
You’ve just signed MORE.
3. Using the flat-O hand shapes from the sign for MORE,
point the fingertips of both hands up.
4. Open and close your hands while alternately moving
them up and down in front of your body (see the bottom
illustration in Figure 11-1).
You’ve just signed BUBBLES to go along with MORE. Easy
peasy.
EAT sentences
Eating is a big part of baby’s life. Heck, it’s a big part of mine. Like
me, my babies love to eat, but there are some things they enjoy
eating more than others. So in other words, just because your baby
wants to eat, don’t expect him to turn flips when you put that bowl
of puréed peas in front of him. With the EAT family of sign sen-
tences, your baby can be more specific, communicating not only
that he wants to eat but what he wants to eat.
Part IV: Now We’re Talking 
166

Figure 11-1: MORE BUBBLES.
Chapter 11: Signing Sentences 167

If your baby loves cookies as much as my three, he’ll appreciate
knowing the sign sentence EAT COOKIE, even if, like me, you rarely
indulge his wishes. To make the sign combo for EAT COOKIE,
follow these steps:
1. Make a flat-O hand shape with one hand (see Chapter 3).
2. Touch the fingertips of your flat-O hand shape to your
mouth repeatedly (see the top drawing in Figure 11-2).
You’ve just signed EAT.
3. Hold out one hand, palm open and facing up, mimicking
rolled-out cookie dough.
4. Form a C hand shape (see Appendix A) with your other
hand, mimicking a cookie cutter.
5. Lower your C hand, fingers and thumb pointing down,
onto the palm of your opposite hand and then raise,
twist, and lower your C hand again, as if you’re using a
cookie cutter to cut out cookie shapes (see the bottom
drawing in Figure 11-2).
You’ve just signed COOKIE to go along with EAT.
PLAY sentences
Baby loves to play. In fact, for now that’s her job. Through her
imaginative play, baby is learning and practicing how to relate to
the world around her. And just as with eating, there are some
things baby enjoys playing with more than others. Using the PLAY
family of sign sentences, baby can let you know the object of her
playtime desires.
Part IV: Now We’re Talking 
168

Figure 11-2: EAT COOKIE.
“Play ball!” is how an umpire signals the beginning of a baseball game.
For your baby, however, the sign sentence PLAY BALL is how she lets
you know she wants to play with her favorite toy. That is, if she loves
balls as much as my youngest, Cole. Here’s how to sign PLAY BALL:
1. Make the ASL letter Y (see Appendix A) with both hands,
palms facing your body.
2. Shake both hands a few times in a playful manner (see
the top drawing in Figure 11-3).
You’ve just signed PLAY.
Chapter 11: Signing Sentences 169

3. Using loose open hands, face your palms toward each
other, roughly shoulder-width apart.
4. Pull your hands out and bounce them back in a few times
as if you’re holding a ball (see the bottom drawing in
Figure 11-3).
You’ve just signed BALL to go along with PLAY.
PLEASE sentences
The magic word. You were probably taught from an early age that
in order to get something you wanted, you had to say please. And
you’re probably passing this mannerly gesture on to your little
one. It’s so ingrained in my kids that any time they make a request,
they automatically follow up with “please” in both sign and speak-
ing. I guess we do whatever it takes to make sure they’re polite.
Only time will tell.
My youngest, Cole, likes to combine the sign for PLEASE with the
sign for DRINK, as this is a frequent request of his. In fact, here’s an
example of a three-sign sentence that Cole often uses: MORE DRINK
PLEASE. Yes, I’m aware that this sentence can go in the MORE
family, too. Regardless of how you categorize it, here’s how to
make the sign sentence:
1. Using both hands, make two flat-O hand shapes (see
Chapter 3).
2. Repeatedly touch the fingertips of both hands (see the
top drawing in Figure 11-4).
You’ve just signed MORE.
3. Form an ASL C (see Appendix A) with one hand and hold
it as if you’re holding a drink.
4. Mimic drinking by bringing your hand to your mouth 
and tilting it several times (see the middle drawing in
Figure 11-4).
You’ve just signed DRINK to go along with MORE.
5. Place your palm flat against your chest as though you’re
about to say the Pledge of Allegiance.
6. Make a circle with your palm on your chest with a 
quizzical look on your face (see the bottom drawing in
Figure 11-4).
You’ve just signed PLEASE to go along with MORE DRINK.

 Getting back on track and keeping the signing going with baby
W
ell, it was bound to happen. A problem or two has popped
up, and you’re ready to throw in the towel on this signing-
with-baby business. Well, hold off until you read this chapter. It
provides answers to some of the questions I hear frequently. This
info will help get you back on track, with your towel tucked back in
the linen closet.
Why Isn’t Baby Signing Back?
Little pumpkin is busy right now. She’s learning to sit up, crawl,
and walk — or some combination thereof. She has a lot on her
mind, and her attention may be focused elsewhere. If your baby
isn’t signing back, consider the following sections.
Maybe you’re overwhelming 
baby with too many signs
Processing lots of signs at once is more than baby’s brain can
handle. You should never be working on more than a handful of
new signs at any given time. What’s a new sign? Any sign that she
hasn’t signed back yet. So if you’re just beginning, work on only a
few initial signs (see Chapter 3 for more information on choosing
these signs).

If you’ve been at it a little while, and baby has signed a few signs
back to you, work on those signs plus a handful of new ones. This
method is how, over time, baby builds her sign vocabulary — not
by being bombarded with a sign for everything in her world. (For
related info, see the section “When Do I Add More Signs?” later in
this chapter.)
Maybe the signs you’re using 
aren’t for the things that 
excite and interest baby
The signs you’re introducing to your baby must also be ones he’s
interested in. He may not be crazy about stars right now, for exam-
ple. In fact, depending on his age, his vision may not even be devel-
oped enough to differentiate stars from the rest of the night sky. So
why should he sign STAR?
As babies, all three of my kids were fascinated by the light when
they looked up toward the ceiling. Blew me away. I mean, who
cares about the lights unless there’s a bulb out? But I found that
the sign for LIGHT (see Chapter 7) was a good fit for their interests.
Toddlers often have a favorite toy. For my 18-month-old son, Cole,
his favorite — at the moment — is his toy train, so the sign for
TRAIN (see Chapter 10) is in the repertoire for him. Pay attention
to your little one, and he’ll reveal his current passions to you.
Maybe baby is trying to sign, 
but you just don’t realize it
Know upfront that your baby’s initial attempts won’t mirror your
signs or even the pictures in this book. Consider, for example, the
sign for HELP (see Chapter 6). It resembles a thumbs-up gesture
with one hand as it rests in the palm of your other hand. But on my
son Cole’s hands, it’s an elbow that rests in the palm of one hand
while the other hand waves. That gesture happens to look an awful
lot like the sign for TREE (see Chapter 10), so how do I know Cole
is signing HELP and not TREE? Context is crucial, as well as the fre-
quency with which Cole repeats his rendition of HELP.
So, if you’re working on the sign for, say, BALL with baby (see
Chapter 10), pay extra attention whenever she’s in the vicinity of 
a ball. Does she make consistent movements with her hands that
even remotely (and it may be very remotely) resemble the sign
Part IV: Now We’re Talking 
174

you’re showing her? If so, then she’s signing! And she’s probably
wondering why you don’t understand her. After all, in her mind,
her sign is identical to yours.
What If I’m the Only One 
Who Signs with Baby?
For whatever reason, baby’s other parent, grandparents, and/or
other caregivers may choose not to sign with him, and sometimes
there’s nothing you can do to convince them otherwise.
Have you shown them the ten reasons to sign with your baby in
Chapter 14? If you have and they still refuse to sign with baby,
know that it’s their loss. Your little one will figure out how to sign
even if you’re the only one who signs with him. Plus, imagine how
your bond with baby will be strengthened by your efforts and com-
mitment to signing.
And don’t lose hope for the other people in baby’s life who refuse
to sign. I’ve seen more than one naysayer turn on a dime when
they see a baby communicate a want or need through sign lan-
guage. For example, the staff at my church’s nursery used to roll
their eyes at the idea of signing with babies. Now, thanks to my
three little signers, the nursery staff is constantly asking me and
my husband (and sometimes our 3-year-old and 4-year-old) to
interpret signs our little ones use, to show them new signs to work
on with other kids, and for general information about signing with
babies. So the first time your little one signs, he just might change
a few minds.
Why Does Baby Use the Same
Sign for Everything?
My poor husband was frustrated for weeks as our youngest, Cole,
our only son, went through a phase of calling his dad mommy. We
had heard him earlier refer to his father as da, da-da, and daddy, so
we knew he understood the difference and could say it as well as
sign it. In fact, he would sign DADDY (see Chapter 4) as he called
my husband mommy. You can imagine my husband’s reaction — 
as well as my own giggling, delighted one. In fact, the reaction he
received probably had a great deal to do with why Cole continued
to call his father mommy.
Chapter 12: Overcoming Stumbling Blocks 175

If your little one is applying the same sign to several objects, the
reasoning is probably similar. She was so delighted by the positive
reaction she received when she used the sign appropriately that
she decided to try the sign with something else. Who can blame
her? She probably didn’t get the same response, but the response
she got, she liked. In search of more reaction, she continues to
apply that same sign to other objects.
What can you do? First, continue to use the correct signs for
objects you’re currently working on. Second, fight the urge to react
when baby misapplies a sign she knows. Though you may not real-
ize it, your attempts to correct her may be just the reaction baby is
seeking, and may even be the reason she knowingly used the incor-
rect sign in the first place. If baby doesn’t get the response she’s
seeking, chances are she’ll return to using the sign appropriately.
And speaking of which, Cole stopped calling his dad mommy at
about the same time my husband resigned himself to the fact that
his only son would call him mommy for the rest of their lives.
Why Doesn’t Baby Sign Anymore?
Your signing baby no longer signs, and you want to know what that
means. Well, it doesn’t mean that he doesn’t understand signing. It
simply means he’s busy. He’s busy learning to push the wagon or
climb on the sofa. Or he’s busy noticing the wind or the sound of
the kitchen clock. For now, communicating with his outside world
has taken a back seat to more pressing matters.
What can you do? First of all, keep signing. Baby will assimilate the
new experiences and information that currently hold his attention.
After he does, he’ll want to pick up signing again because you’ve
continued to sign with him. To make the most of this hiatus, focus
on the things that are keeping him busy right now. If he stops in his
tracks to feel the wind blow against his cheek, then show him the
sign for WIND (see Chapter 10). When he’s ready to sign again,
make WIND one of the handful of new signs you work on with him.
How do you know when baby’s ready to sign again? If you continue
to sign to him throughout his break from signing, he’ll surprise you
one day and simply begin to sign back again, as though he never
skipped a beat. If you stop signing because baby seems to have
taken a break, then your baby may never pick up signing again.
Part IV: Now We’re Talking 
176

When Do I Add More Signs?
Repeat after me: “I will not ask my baby to process too many new
signs at once.” This point is crucial. Otherwise, she’ll become 
overwhelmed by the task and may shut down and ignore signing
altogether.
You — and the other signers in her life — should only show your
baby the signs she knows and the new signs she’s working on.
Anything more than a handful of the latter is too much.
How does baby’s sign vocabulary grow? As she begins to repeat a
sign back to you, think about another new sign to work on. Or per-
haps she’s beginning to show a great deal of interest in a certain
object. Don’t miss this opportunity. Go ahead and replace a current
new sign that you’re working on — one that baby doesn’t seem as
interested in — with the sign for this new interest. You can just
revisit the sign you’ve replaced later, when baby’s ready. That said,
be careful not to shuffle signs in and out of your list of signs to
work on too frequently. Trying to stick with a new sign until baby
knows it is important.
Instead of doing the shuffle, you may simply decide to add the sign
for a new item of interest to your current handful of new signs to
work on. That’s fine. There is no magic number of signs to include
in your handful. Again, just exercise caution when adding new signs.
Baby is interested in a lot of different things from day to day. As a
result, your handful of signs can easily become an armful before
you realize it.
The bottom line? Take your cues from your baby.
What If My Baby Isn’t Talking,
but He’s Signing like Crazy?
First off, take a deep breath. Rejoice in the fact that your baby is
communicating with you in some fashion! Talk to your doctor
about speech development norms and voice your concerns. Do
some family research. Were you or baby’s other parent a late
talker? Sometimes these tendencies run in families. Regardless, if
your parental instinct is telling you that something’s wrong, listen
to it. Plenty of places are available to get answers in the form of
information or even testing.
Chapter 12: Overcoming Stumbling Blocks 177

No matter what, under no circumstances allow anyone to tell 
you that the reason he’s not talking is due to the signing. Yes, 
studies have shown that signing has an impact on a baby’s speech
development — but this impact is a positive one. Signing won’t
slow your baby’s speech development; it will enhance your baby’s
speech development. Chances are, he would’ve had the speech-
delay issues whether you signed with him or not. And imagine how
much more difficult things would be if you weren’t signing with
him. (I also briefly cover this issue in Chapter 1. And you may want
to check out the sidebar in that chapter about my own daughter’s
speech delay.)

How Long Do We 
Keep This Up?
In This Chapter
 Recognizing the long-term benefits of continuing the signing journey
 Understanding the impact that signing has on sibling relationships
E
ventually, you’ll get to a point where you’ll stop signing very
much with your little one. It may be because he’s started
speaking more and signing isn’t as necessary for communication,
or it may be because you’ve just had too much going on to be con-
sistent with signing with him. At this point, you’ll probably begin to
wonder how much longer you should sign with your baby, toddler,
or even preschooler.
The reality here is that you don’t need to keep signing if your only
goal has been to interact more specifically with your nonverbal
baby or toddler. But many families discover that they’re having
such a good time interacting with each other through signs that
they’re not ready to quit.
Trust me, there’s nothing more incredible than a 4-year-old who
actively knows and uses over 300 signs on a daily basis. My 4-year-
old came to me just this morning and whispered in my ear that
she’d only be using signs today. No words from her mouth. We’ll
see how long it lasts. Even if she doesn’t make it for 15 minutes,
her family has given her the option to do it if she so desires.
In addition to the fun your child will have by continuing the signing
journey, he’ll receive some long-term benefits as well. This chapter
explains what they are.

Better Student All Around
An obvious long-term benefit of signing is that kids who sign have
an additional way to communicate. According to Dr. Marilyn
Daniels, author of Dancing with Words, as signing kids get older,
sometimes they don’t have a word in their spoken vocabulary but
do have that word in their sign vocabulary, enabling them to get
their point across and feel satisfied with their communication.
That’s fine and good in itself, but consider what else Dr. Daniels
found: She did extensive research following signing babies through
sixth grade, and what she found was that sixth graders who had
signed as infants and toddlers and continued using sign language
were better students all around, scoring higher on tests and having
better performance levels in the classroom.
According to Dr. Daniels’s Web site (www.marilyndaniels.com),
her research shows “how sign language can be used to improve
hearing children’s English vocabulary, reading ability, spelling pro-
ficiency, self-esteem, and comfort with expressing emotions.”
Improved language arts skills
American Sign Language (ASL) has roughly one sign to every eight
or nine English words. So how on Earth can Dr. Daniels claim that
sign language affects vocabulary, reading, and spelling? Well, for
one thing, a signer often has to figure out a different sign to use for
a word that doesn’t have an actual sign. Most times the signer ends
up having to use a synonym of the original word, so the signer
ends up with a bigger vocabulary as a result.
For example, a month before my daughter Aidan Elizabeth turned 
2 years old, and several months before she was diagnosed with a
speech delay, my family was driving down a freeway. We passed a
car dealership with a large pink gorilla on its roof. Newly 3-year-old
daughter Darby said, “Look, Mommy, that gorilla is giant!” I said,
“You’re right, that is a big gorilla.” Aidan Elizabeth said, “It huge!”
and signed the synonym BIG. Her father and I were completely
blown away.
Consider also that many ASL signs begin with an individual letter
sign. This framework aids in spelling proficiency as children learn
the ASL alphabet and then as they learn to spell words. If children
sign and spell out loud their spelling words, they have a greater
chance of remembering and actually learning those words.

180

With these examples, you can begin to connect the dots between
signing and long-term benefits to language arts skills.
Improved self-esteem and comfort
expressing emotions
As for how sign language can improve self-esteem and comfort
with expressing emotions, consider my take: When an adult works
with a child through signing, the adult is paying lots of extra atten-
tion to the child by watching the child’s movements and reading
his emotions. The child feels validated because an adult is taking
the time to understand him.
And identifying feelings for children as they are expressed will help
them in the long run be better communicators and more comfort-
able expressing their emotions. Signing the feelings will enhance
communication even more.
Higher IQ and Less ADD/ADHD
Hand in hand with helping children be better students all around,
continuing the signing journey also helps children’s IQ scores and
their ability to combat Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADD/ADHD).
Higher IQ scores
Although boosting your sweetie’s brain power shouldn’t be the
only reason you sign with her, it is absolutely an added bonus.
Chapter 13: How Long Do We Keep This Up? 181
You’re asking me?
My children love that adults — who are usually the ones in an authoritative position —
ask them how to do certain signs. It really boosts the kids’ self-esteem. Granted, at
first the adults usually ask me if the signs are correct, but they quickly stop asking
because they realize my kids really do know their stuff. Well, sometimes the adults
still have to seek a little clarification when my 18-month-old signs, itty-bitty hands
and all.

Dr. Linda Acredolo and Dr. Sarah Goodwyn, authors of Baby Signs,
did some research back in the early 1980s that provided some
astounding results. Children who signed as babies scored an aver-
age of 12 points higher on IQ tests than their non-signing peers. So
beyond the immediate benefits of communicating with your baby,
in less than ten years, you and your baby will be reaping even
more benefits.
Less ADD/ADHD
This is a strong claim — and it doesn’t promise your kid won’t
have ADD/ADHD. It is, however, a way to potentially reduce a
child’s ADD/ADHD. Signing children as a whole seem to have a
better handle on expressing their feelings because they have an
additional outlet to do so. Additionally, ADD/ADHD children often
have a difficult time being still or focusing on one thing. Because
signing is a kinesthetic activity, it gives children’s hands something
to do, instead of acting out. Signing helps children focus better
because it allows them to physically process information with their
hands and bodies. Dr. Daniels followed signing babies through
sixth grade and saw a large variant in ADD/ADHD between signing
children and non-signing children.
Stronger Sibling Relationships
Not much research has been done on this subject, at least that I
can find, so I’m going to use my experience with my own children
here. Research abounds on how signing can strengthen the rela-
tionship between parents and children. Well, signing can also
strengthen the relationship between siblings.
Big sis Darby taught little sis Aidan Elizabeth colors with sign. I
have a video of them at around 3 and 2 years of age where Aidan
Elizabeth was signing WHAT COLOR and holding up a crayon and
Darby was signing back RED as she spoke the word.
I also have a video of Darby and Aidan Elizabeth showing signs to
little bro Cole, who was only weeks old at the time — they were
trying to make him do the signs as well. “Cole, you’re a BOY. Darby
is a GIRL. Aidan Elizabeth is a GIRL.” “Cole, this is how you sign
COOKIE.” “Cole, this is how you sign POTTY.” (We must have our
priorities after all.)
All the time at my house, the kids go up to each other, tap the
other on the shoulder, and sign whatever they want to communi-
cate. “TIME to GO to DANCE!”
Part IV: Now We’re Talking 
182

And although they’re usually perfect angels, on occasion, they
have to sit in timeout. I’ve begun catching them, especially if more
than one is in timeout at the same time, signing back and forth to
each other. So now the new rule is “You may not talk or sign while
you’re in timeout.”
I guess the bottom line I’m trying to express is
They sign, therefore they bond.
Signing is a special form of communication that brothers and sis-
ters can share together, which in the process strengthens their
relationship.
Chapter 13: How Long Do We Keep This Up? 183
I’m looking out for you, sister
Sixteen-month-old signing baby Avery was in her high chair. Mom was feeding her
the usual foods, and Avery was fussing and refusing them all.
Mom said and signed, “Do you want some GRAPES?” No.
“Do you want some MILK?” No.
“Do you want a CRACKER?” No.
“Do you want a BANANA?” No.
Things were getting frustrating fast and going nowhere.
Three-year-old big brother, Carter, stepped in as he signed and asked, “Avery, do
you want some CAKE?”
Mom looked at Carter and laughed. Avery laughed. Carter laughed. Fussy situation
diverted.
Carter used signs to help his mom take care of his little sister. He was modeling
mom’s behavior as many 3-year-olds do in giving care to babies. This just happened
to be a signing family for Carter to model. I bet they all remembered the sign for
CAKE from there on out. And I believe that by good-naturedly signing with his sister,
Carter is also strengthening his relationship with her.

Part V
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
W
ith just about anything in life, if you pose the same
question to ten different people, you’ll get ten dif-
ferent answers. Keep that thought in mind when perusing
this part of the book. Each list is my attempt to offer the
ten best choices related to some important topics about
baby signing. Here, you ﬁnd ten reasons to sign with your
baby, ten signs you and your baby should know, ten songs
you can sign with baby, and ten resources to help you
along the baby-signing path. Personally, I believe Part V
alone is worth the price you paid for the whole book!

Chapter 14
Ten Reasons to 
Sign with Baby
In This Chapter
 Knowing what to tell the doubters when they ask why you sign
 Finding reasons to give baby’s grandparents to convince them to sign
 Getting some convincing reasons to do this whole signing-with-baby thing
M
aybe you (or your spouse or significant other) picked this
book up, brought it home, and then let it just sit there gath-
ering dust — you’ve been awfully busy with that baby, after all —
and now you’re wondering why you (or said spouse or significant
other) brought it home in the first place.
Or maybe you (he, she, whoever) picked up this book, rushed right
home, and opened it pronto. Or, if you’re like I was once, you’re
standing in a bookstore right now trying to decide if this whole
signing-with-baby phenomenon is worth your time — and the cost
of this book. Hopefully, these ten reasons will help convince you
the effort is worth both.
Reduce Frustration
I hear ya: “Great . . . where do I sign up?” But first, don’t you want
to know whose frustration is reduced? Is it yours, or is it baby’s?
The answer is both. Signing reduces your baby’s frustration because
she can communicate her needs before she’s able to verbalize
them with anything other than a blood-curdling scream. And sign-
ing reduces your frustration because your blood is not curdled
nearly as often. Let’s face it, the sooner your baby can communi-
cate her needs in a way you can understand and respond to, the
less frustrating life is for both of you.

Consider the standard wild-goose chase parents go on as baby is
crying: “Is she hungry? Does something hurt? Need a change? Want
up? Need help?” You know what I’m talking about, and the whole
process is extremely frustrating. With signs, you get to peek into
baby’s mind and figure out much more quickly (and much more
quietly) what she wants. Gotta love that.
Now I’m not saying your baby will never cry again. And I’m not
saying she’ll be able to communicate with signs tomorrow. I’m saying
that signing is a tool you can work with to help you understand
baby’s world much sooner and much more clearly than you’ll be
able to without signs, which in turn reduces frustration all the way
around.
Improve Communication Skills
Sign language is a tool your baby can use to interact with his
world. He’ll enjoy the fact that he can express his needs in a way
you and others can understand. And you’ll enjoy being able to
understand him. But the communication benefits don’t end there.
You’ve probably heard or read that most communication is nonver-
bal. Well, consider that with sign language, your baby is already
learning to rely on and develop means other than his voice to
express himself, so he’s a step ahead of the game. When he learns
to speak, he’ll already know that his hands, his posture, and his
facial expression enhance his words. Many of the first words my
children spoke were words they first learned to sign.
Strengthen Family Relationships
Think about it: Your baby is paying more attention to you (looking
for a sign), and you’re paying more attention to her (ditto). Also,
coaching baby to sign is a process. If you want your baby to sign
with you, then you have to invest your time and effort in that
process and in your baby. Through signing with baby, you’re let-
ting her know that you care about her because you value what
she’s trying to communicate. This is true for extended family, care-
givers, anyone who spends time and effort in getting to know sign
language and helping to coach baby.
Speaking of extended family, know up front that your in-laws will
probably think you’re crazy when you tell them you’re showing
their grandchild sign language. Mine had to see a story about sign-
ing with babies in their local newspaper before they liked the idea.

188

Heck, my own dad was rolling his eyes until my daughter Darby,
then 10 months old, baby-stepped her way up to his aquarium on
her own and began signing FISH (see Chapter 9). Then, all of a
sudden, signing was the greatest thing since sliced bread.
Reap Long-Term Benefits
This is the reason many people pick up a book like this to begin
with. They want their babies to be the best at everything and want
to give them an edge any way they can. Although I have reserva-
tions about this motivation, the fact that signing with baby yields
long-term benefits cannot be denied.
Here’s the quickie scoop about two studies that prove it:
 Linda Acredolo, PhD, and Susan Goodwin, PhD, are the
authors of Baby Signs: How to Talk with Your Baby Before Your
Baby Can Talk. This was the first book devoted to nonverbal
communication between parents and babies. One of the most
recent studies from these pioneers established that children
who used Baby Signs as infants had a 12-point higher IQ in
second grade than those who did not.
 Marilyn Daniels, Professor of Speech Communication at
Pennsylvania State University, is author of the book Dancing
with Words: Signing for Hearing Children’s Literacy. Daniels’s
research for her book followed signing children from infancy
to sixth grade. The results were staggering in many areas. One
of the most exciting findings is that children with Attention
Deficit Disorder (ADD) or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder (ADHD) can use American Sign Language (ASL) to
better focus on the world around them. Signing with your
baby doesn’t guarantee that he won’t be diagnosed with one
of these disorders in the future. But if he is, you’ve already
given him tools to help him overcome the challenges he’ll
face.
Provide Extra Fun
Believe it or not, signing with baby really is a lot of fun. Signing
opens doors to a whole new world of games for you and baby to
play. Just imagine how signing can help fill the time on a road trip.
Sign language also adds another dimension, often babies’ favorite
one, to story time and singing.
Chapter 14: Ten Reasons to Sign with Baby 189

ASL is an incredibly expressive language, and babies are naturally
drawn to and often easily amused by expressiveness. Sometimes
the more dramatic you make a sign, the more baby will love it and
want to make the sign, too.
Gain More Priceless Moments
As you’re already aware, parenthood is filled with priceless
moments. Whether they’re milestones (like watching her roll over,
say her first word, get her first tooth, crawl, or take those first
steps) or simple things (like watching her sleep on your chest,
inhaling the scent of her head, or feeling her grasp your finger in
her tiny hand), these moments are some of life’s true miracles.
Signing adds even more.
For example, my 3-year-old daughter, Aidan Elizabeth, will from
time to time catch my eye from across the room. Without a word
from her or any prompting from me, she’ll smile and sign I LOVE
YOU (see Chapter 4). Moments like this take my breath away and
make me even more thankful that I chose to sign with my children.
Develop SPI (Silent 
Parental Influence)
If you haven’t already, you’ll soon develop The Look. It’s different
for every parent, but it means the same thing to all children: “I’m in
trouble, or I’m about to be.”
Imagine supplementing and enhancing The Look with the ability to
silently communicate specific words and phrases. Picture this, for
example: You’re at an indoor playground (you know, the kind
where your kids have to remove their shoes to play), it’s time to
go, you catch your child’s glance, and you sign, “You’re FINISHED
PLAYING. Get your SHOES.” And he does it. Leave the yelling to the
non-signing parents. (By the way, you can turn to Chapter 5 for FIN-
ISHED, Chapter 10 for PLAYING, and Chapter 8 for SHOES.)
Signs are often so intuitive that this tactic sometimes even works
with older, non-signing children. I volunteer at our church, and a
couple of years ago I was working with a group of fifth-graders and
the kids were supposed to be listening to another adult’s presenta-
tion. But one of my students, Caleb, was wandering around the room
for a reason known only to him. I caught his eye and emphatically
Part V: The Part of Tens 
190

signed and mouthed “SIT down NOW!” He did. Later I expressed my
excitement that he knew ASL. He said he didn’t know ASL, but he got
the message anyway. Ah, the power of signs.
Develop PSI (Parental 
Self Improvement)
So, when’s the last time you studied another language? Granted,
signing with your baby won’t necessarily teach you all of ASL.
However, it can give you a good foundation for the language, and
you can take it as far as you choose. If you get proficient with the
ASL alphabet (see Appendix A), you can finger-spell anything. In
what other language can you figure out just the alphabet and then
be able to communicate clearly (albeit slowly)?
Own the Spotlight
Yes, I’ll admit that signing with your baby is a party trick of sorts.
Complete strangers will notice you and your baby signing, and
they’ll stop to ask questions. Family and friends will request on-
demand performances. You and your baby will be stars, owning
the spotlight.
My 18-month-old, Cole, held court the other day with a group of
teenagers for a good 20 minutes, as they repeatedly asked, “What
else can he sign?” I told them he had a vocabulary of over 100
signs, but they wanted to see for themselves. Luckily, he had just
napped and was accommodating. But if he hadn’t, maybe he
would’ve signed TIRED (see Chapter 7)!
You Never Know Where It’ll Lead
My husband and I started signing with our first daughter four years
ago because we thought it sounded interesting and wanted to see
whether it worked. Plus, we were first-time parents and determined
(some might call it neurotic) to try anything baby-related. Oh, and
we lived out in the country — really, our next-door neighbors were
cows — and we were looking for ways to fill our time. This is also
why we ended up with our second child, born only 131⁄2 months
after her older sister. But I digress.
Chapter 14: Ten Reasons to Sign with Baby 191

Eventually I became an instructor, teaching other parents how to
sign with their babies. I’ve spoken at national conferences to groups
of preschool teachers about signing in the classroom. I’ve led semi-
nars for parents and play classes for caregivers and children. I’ve
also had the privilege of working with special-needs children and
their families. And now you’re reading my book. I always wanted to
be an author, but I never dreamed I’d be writing about signing with
babies.
Signing with babies has become one of my life’s passions. Who
knows what doors signing with your baby will open for you?

Ten Signs Every Baby and
Toddler Should Know
In This Chapter
 Helping your baby communicate with you
 Signing favorites for babies and toddlers
 Finding ten signs to teach your baby, even if you don’t teach her any
others
I
f you’re reading this chapter, then that means either
(a) You’ve read everything you care to read elsewhere in this
book, and now you want to confirm which ten signs to defi-
nitely use with your baby.
or
(b) You’re ready to jump in with both feet, and you don’t cur-
rently have time to read the details that go along with these
signs elsewhere in this book.
So for your easy reference — or your need for speed — this chap-
ter provides the bare-bones directions for ten of the most impor-
tant and useful signs for babies and toddlers.
Bed
Follow these steps (and check out Chapter 7 for details about this
sign and others related to it):
1. Place the palm of your hand on your ear.
2. Tilt your head to the same side as if you’re using your
hand for a pillow (see Figure 15-1).

Figure 15-1: BED.
Eat
Follow these steps (and check out Chapter 5 for details about this
sign and others related to it):
1. Make a flat-O hand shape by first forming an O with your
fingers and thumb and then flattening them out so that it
looks like a deflated balloon (see Chapter 3).
2. Touch your fingertips to your mouth repeatedly (see
Figure 15-2).
Part V: The Part of Tens 
194

Figure 15-2: EAT.
Finished
Follow these steps (and check out Chapter 5 for details about this
sign and others related to it):
1. Place both hands in the air, near your shoulders, finger-
tips pointing up, palms facing away from your body.
2. Rotate your hands at the wrists so that your palms face
your body.
3. Repeat the rotation several times (see Figure 15-3).
Chapter 15: Ten Signs Every Baby and Toddler Should Know 195

Figure 15-3: FINISHED.
Help
Follow these steps (and check out Chapter 6 for details about this
sign and others related to it):
1. Place a fist, thumb up, on top of the opposite palm.
2. While keeping that position, move both hands up (see
Figure 15-4).
Figure 15-4: HELP.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
196

Hurt
Follow these steps (and check out Chapter 6 for details about this
sign and others related to it):
1. Extend both index fingers and repeatedly almost touch
their tips.
That action signs HURT in general. If you want to show a
specific place on the body that HURTS, read Step 2. If you
want to show that feelings are HURT, skip Step 2 and read
Step 3.
2. If a specific body part HURTS, move your hands to the
vicinity of the body part that hurts while doing Step 1.
3. If feelings are HURT instead of a body part, twist your
hands and fingers in opposite directions over your 
heart while doing Step 1 and making a sad face (see
Figure 15-5).
Figure 15-5: HURT.
Milk
Follow these steps (and check out Chapter 5 for details about this
sign and others related to it):
Chapter 15: Ten Signs Every Baby and Toddler Should Know 197

1. Imagine that a cow is standing right beside you.
2. Open and close the fist of one hand several times, little
finger closest to the floor (see Figure 15-6).
Figure 15-6: MILK.
More
Follow these steps (and check out Chapter 5 for details about this
sign and others related to it):
1. Using both hands, make two flat-O hand shapes (see
Chapter 3).
2. Repeatedly touch the fingertips of both hands (see 
Figure 15-7).
Part V: The Part of Tens 
198

Figure 15-7: MORE.
Please
Follow these steps:
1. Place your palm flat against your chest like you’re about
to say the Pledge of Allegiance.
2. Make a circle with your palm on your chest with a quizzi-
cal look on your face (see Figure 15-8).
Chapter 15: Ten Signs Every Baby and Toddler Should Know 199

Figure 15-8: PLEASE.
Stop
Follow these steps (and check out Chapter 6 for details about this
sign and others related to it):
1. Hold out one hand as if preparing to shake hands with
someone.
2. Hold out your opposite hand so that the palm is facing up.
3. Use the edge of Step 1’s hand to come down sharply on
your opposite hand’s palm (see Figure 15-9).

Figure 15-9: STOP.
Thank You
Follow these steps (and check out Chapter 4 for details about this
sign and others related to it):
1. Place the tips of your fingers on your chin.
2. In one gesture, move your hand down with your finger-
tips pointing away from your chin (see Figure 15-10).

Ten (Or So) Songs to Sign
In This Chapter
 Putting additional fun into baby’s signing experience
 Getting a feel for which words to sign in songs
S
igning and singing with children go together as naturally as
peas and carrots. In fact, lots of children’s songs already have
motions to them, but be careful to be clear that they’re “motions”
and not actual signs. That’s how our family has dealt with our girls
coming home from preschool and saying, “Look, I learned the signs
for a song!” My husband and I always explain (over and over and
over again) that they’ve learned the motions to the song, and then
we show them what the actual signs for the words look like.
Granted, as a result, my firstborn, Darby, who’s 4, has been known
to tell her teachers that she’s not learning signs today; she’s just
learning motions and her mommy will teach her the signs when
she gets home from school. A little embarrassing, yes, but at least
she knows what she’s talking about.
Anyway, this chapter gets you started with ten (minus two, but let’s
face it, only a pooterhead would actually count and then tattletale
to my publisher) well-known children’s songs to sign. Note that I
haven’t included each and every verse of these songs — just the
main verse or two that most children become very familiar with. I
hope you and baby enjoy this experience.
I highly recommend that you pick out one or two words to sign
from each song instead of trying to sign all the words. Pick words
that occur frequently in the song or are part of the climax of the
song so that you can be dramatic and call attention to those partic-
ular signs. And don’t forget to have fun!

The Itsy Bitsy Spider
When I’m talking to people about signing with babies or toddlers, 
I like to point out the differences between signing “The Itsy Bitsy
Spider” and doing the motions we’re all familiar with. For this 
song, I recommend that at first you pick out just one or two of the
following signs to use with baby: WATER (see Chapter 7), RAIN (see
Chapter 10), SUN (see Chapter 10), and SPIDER, which isn’t cov-
ered elsewhere in this book so here are the directions:
1. Make claw-C hand shapes with both hands (see Chapter 3),
palms facing down.
2. Cross one hand over the other.
3. Wiggle your fingers like the legs of a spider (see 
Figure 16-1).
Figure 16-1: Itsy Bitsy SPIDER.
After you choose the one or two signs you’re going to focus on
with baby, sing and sign away:
The itsy bitsy SPIDER
Climbed up the WATER spout.
Down came the RAIN
Part V: The Part of Tens 
204

And washed the SPIDER out.
Out came the SUN
And dried up all the RAIN.
And the itsy bitsy SPIDER
Climbed up the spout again.
Old MacDonald
A favorite among children of all ages, this song is a great way to
practice the various animal signs found in Chapter 9. The following
example uses DUCK, but Chapter 9 also covers the signs for COW,
HORSE, SHEEP, PIG, CHICKEN, and FROG, as well as various pets
and zoo animals:
Old MacDonald had a farm
e-i-e-i-o
On this farm he had a DUCK
e-i-e-i-o
With a quack quack here [sign DUCK as you say “quack”]
And a quack quack there
Here a quack, there a quack
Everywhere a quack quack
Old MacDonald had a farm
e-i-e-i-o
Row, Row, Row Your Boat
This song is a favorite at bath time or when my children visit their
grandparents’ lake house. Two signs are great to use while singing
this song: BOAT, which you can find in Chapter 10, and HAPPY
(used for merrily), which you can find in Chapter 6. Here you go:
Row, row, row your BOAT
Gently down the stream
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily [sign HAPPY as you sing “mer-
rily”]
Life is but a dream.
Chapter 16: Ten (Or So) Songs to Sign 205

Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star
When my oldest child, Darby, was a toddler, she sang and signed
this song to every baby she came across, after getting tons of prac-
tice singing and signing it to her baby sister, Aidan Elizabeth. I’ve
actually seen Darby stop a crying baby in a crowded store by
working her magic with this song. And Aidan Elizabeth could carry
this tune while signing it long before she could sing the words to it.
So, yes, it’s absolutely a Watson family favorite. Hopefully, it’ll be a
favorite of your family’s, too.
As for which signs to use, I recommend that at first you choose
among STAR (Chapter 10), WHAT (Chapter 1), and UP, which isn’t
covered elsewhere in this book but is a breeze to make: Just point
to the sky, and you’ve signed UP.
Now that you have your signs, here’s your song:
Twinkle, twinkle little STAR
How I wonder WHAT you are
UP above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle little STAR
How I wonder WHAT you are
Baa, Baa Black Sheep
This song is a fun way to help children understand that wool comes
from sheep. In fact, the sign for SHEEP mimics shearing a sheep (see
Chapter 9). In addition, you can substitute other colors for black in
the song, giving you an opportunity to practice some color signs
(various ones, including BLACK, are covered in Appendix C). And if
you’d like to sign the word YES in the song (just because it’s fun),
form the sign by making an ASL letter S (see Appendix A) and simply
pretending it’s a head nodding “yes.” Got it? Good! Here you go:
Baa, baa BLACK SHEEP
Have you any wool?
YES sir, YES sir
Three bags full
One for my master
Part V: The Part of Tens 
206

One for my dame
One for the little boy
Who lives in the lane
Baa, baa BLACK SHEEP
Have you any wool?
YES sir, YES sir
Three bags full
Mary Had a Little Lamb
This song is always a hit with babies and toddlers. And if you want,
you can make substitutions in this song, too. For example, you can
substitute your child’s name for Mary and substitute other animals
for lamb to practice various animal signs (see Chapter 9). And feel
free to substitute other colors for white to practice color signs (see
Appendix C). Note that the sign for LAMB is the same as SHEEP
(see Chapter 9) and the sign for SNOW is in Chapter 10. With that
info in your back pocket, you’re good to go:
Mary had a little LAMB
Little LAMB, little LAMB
Mary had a little LAMB
Its fleece was WHITE as SNOW
The Alphabet Song
If you’re not singing the ABC song yet, you will be soon. Learning
the alphabet is an important part of childhood and the foundation
for learning to read and write. I’ve lost count of the number of
times we sing this song daily in our house.
The signs for the alphabet are in Appendix A, but obviously you
won’t expect a baby or toddler to make all these signs. Signing
these individual letters will likely be fun down the road, at around
school age:
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P,
Q, R, S,

I’ve Been Working on the Railroad
My son Cole’s fascination with trains began early and continues to
grow on a daily basis. Cole likes for everyone in my family to sing
this song for him so he can sign TRAIN (see Chapter 10) and make
the train-whistle sound. Besides using the sign for TRAIN in this
song, you and your baby can also use the sign for WORK, which
you make like so:
1. Make two fists, palms down, and place one fist on top of
the other.
2. Hit the bottom fist with the top one a few times (see
Figure 16-2).
Figure 16-2: WORKing hard.

Now put those signs to good use:
I’ve been WORKing on the RAILROAD [sign TRAIN]
All the livelong day
I’ve been WORKing on the RAILROAD
Just to pass the time away.
Can’t you hear the whistle blowing? [make a whistle sound]
Rise up so early in the morn?
Can’t you hear the captain shouting,
“Dinah, blow your horn?”

E
ven if I wanted to, I couldn’t get every little detail about sign-
ing with your baby in this book. My goal, of course, is just to
cover the basics, but know that there’s a lot more info out there. If
you decide that you want to tap into it, you may want to start with
one or more of the ten resources listed in this chapter. These
resources will assist you in finding more ways to sign with your
baby, as well as finding signs not covered in this book.
ASLPro.com
This site (www.aslpro.com), which serves as a reference and
offers learning tools, gives you access to thousands of American
Sign Language (ASL) signs. It even includes a specific section of
signs that can be difficult to find elsewhere.
ImaginationSigners.com
This is my personal Web site, so of course, it’s the best one. You
can find it at www.imaginationsigners.com. At this site, you can
purchase some of these recommended signing products and check
out my class and seminar schedules, as well as contact me with
news on how signing is going for you and yours.

Little Signers, Inc.
This site (www.littlesigners.com) is run by a group of ASL inter-
preters who teach classes, offer lots of pointers, and sell ASL books
that are not always easily found elsewhere.
Sign2Me.com
This site (www.sign2me.com) is the Web site of Joseph Garcia, one
of the pioneers in the area of signing with babies. This site is a
great resource for info about signing with babies. In addition, it
offers signing classes based on the research of Joseph Garcia, a
pioneer in the field of baby signing and an advocate of ASL instead
of invented gestures.
Signing with Your Baby
A mom who loves signing with children put together this amazing
and comprehensive Web site (www.signingbaby.com) on signing
with babies. The site includes tips, forums, and an online store.
Baby Einstein’s Baby Wordsworth
First Words — Around the House
With a famous face or two, this Baby Einstein DVD is big fun on the
signing spectrum. Look for about 45 signs within its 45 minutes.
Lots of fun signs are here, including the sign for computer. You can
go to www.babyeinstein.com and, in the Product Search box at
the top of the page, type Baby Wordsworth and then click the
Search button. You’ll be taken to a page where you can find this
DVD, among other products.
Signing Smart
At www.signingsmart.com, you can find info on the research done
by the founders of the Signing Smart program, Dr. Michele Anthony
Part V: The Part of Tens 
212

and Dr. Reyna Lindert. Signing Smart offers play classes and parent
workshops, and the program focuses on strategies to make signing
with your baby more productive. It’s a very comprehensive curricu-
lum and is even offered internationally. All signs are ASL signs.
Developed to go with Signing Smart’s handbooks and book, the
Signing Smart Treasure Chest, Volume 1 and Volume 2, videos encom-
pass Signing Smart strategies and signs featured in Signing Smart’s
books and classes. Approximate running time is 30 minutes per
volume. You can order them through www.signingsmart.com. From
the home page, click on Store, and you’ll find all kinds of resources.
Kindermusik has teamed up with Signing Smart to create a music
and signing class. Sing and Sign is an eight-week course and is
taught by Kindermusik instructors found globally. All signs are ASL
signs. You can find more about these classes at the Kindermusik
Web site (www.kindermusik.com).
Signing Time
Oh, the number of children I have seen discover ASL from the
video series offered through this site. Personally, I’ve used these
videos with kids in all grades of elementary school, as well as with
my own kids. In the videos, Alex, who is a hearing child, and Leah,
who is deaf, along with Leah’s mom, Rachel, will sign, sing, and
dance their way into your heart. There are 13 volumes in the
Signing Time series and two volumes focusing on babies as well.
Signing Time sells books and flashcards, too. Signing Time may
even be on your local PBS station. All signs are ASL signs. At
www.signingtime.com you can find loads of resources to help
teach hearing children, deaf children, and special-needs children
how to use ASL.
The first time my 2-year-old signing baby Darby watched a Signing
Time DVD, she picked up three signs. When I started watching
Signing Time DVDs with my kids two years ago, there were only
three volumes. Obviously, with 13 DVDs now available, the com-
pany’s sales have exploded. You’ll see why when you see them. For
a sneak peak, you can check out your local PBS station and see if
Signing Time is broadcast there. The DVDs and the show are
approximately 30 minutes each. And you can find out more about
ordering them by going to www.signingtime.com/products/.

Tiny Fingers
Tiny Fingers (www.tinyfingers.com) offers classes in
Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia. The classes have been
developed and are taught by a certified ASL interpreter. All signs
are ASL signs.
Baby Fingers
Baby Fingers (www.mybabyfingers.com) offers classes throughout
New York City. Class options are available for very young infants
through preschool-aged children. All signs are ASL signs.
Baby Signs
Dr. Linda Acredolo and Dr. Susan Goodwyn provided the initial
research on signing with hearing babies. Through the Baby Signs
site (www.babysigns.com), they offer classes in baby signing inter-
nationally. Their Baby Signs curriculum and book are ASL-based,
but they also advocate invented gestures.
Gymboree’s Sign & Play classes are offered through a cooperative
effort between Gymboree (www.gymboree.com) and Baby Signs.
The classes, which span six weeks, cover signs to incorporate into
daily life.
KiddiesSigns.com
This site (www.kiddiessigns.com) is awesome. You can rent and
buy software or DVDs of signing kids in several situations. There
are options for songs, stories, and the ASL alphabet. One unique
feature of this series is that you can choose the ethnic background
of the child in your rental or purchase. Another unique and amaz-
ing feature is that this series actually teaches ASL in full, not just
the individual signs for certain objects, so hearing-impaired people
and their families can benefit from it, too.
HandSpeak
For a small fee, you can access the wealth of information on ASL
that the HandSpeak Web site offers (www.handspeak.com). This
Part V: The Part of Tens

site has a section on signing with baby, and it focuses on signs per-
tinent to life with baby — always a good thing.
Baby Hands Productions
The Web site of Baby Hands Productions (www.mybabycantalk.com)
offers a DVD series that’s best described by the site itself: “These
DVDs are the first baby sign language learning programs that fea-
ture preverbal babies signing all of the words presented. Babies
love to watch this video and they learn to sign!” All signs are 
ASL signs.

Part VI
Appendixes

In this part . . .
M
y husband lost his appendix when he was 10 years
old. I was able to hold on to mine until just a couple
of years ago. So there are only three appendixes left in my
home (unless ﬁsh have them, too). In honor of my three
appendix-laden children, in this book I include three
appendixes (my husband says “appendices” . . . oh well,
toma¯to/tomäto).
Letters, numbers, colors — they’re all a part of growing
up, whether you sign with your children or not. You can
enhance their experience when they get there by adding
signs for, say, the ABCs, the numbers one through ten, and
some common colors, which are the focus of Part VI. Note
too that various alphabet and number signs are often used
as starting points to create other signs. You can see this
principle applied in Appendix C, as the signs for most
common colors begin with a letter sign. And, trust me,
baby will love signing his favorite colors. So add these
three sets of signs to your signing vocabulary, and your
baby will reap the rewards.

Appendix A
The ASL Alphabet
A
h, the ABC song. If you’re a parent of a baby or toddler, know
that you’ll eventually sing that song ’til you’re blue in the face,
and then some. Even though the alphabet is probably not a major
deal right now, it will become pretty important to both you and
your sweet baby. It’s the foundation of that ever-important primary
goal of elementary school: learning to read.
In the meantime, the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet
(shown in Figures A-1 through A-26) can become pretty important
to you and your baby. Many ASL word signs begin with a specific
ASL letter sign, so knowing the ASL alphabet can give you a jump-
start on some word signs. The bonus is that when your little bundle
of joy eventually goes off for his first year of school and learning the
alphabet becomes more important, the ASL alphabet will provide a
fun way for you and your budding student to practice the alphabet
together. Plus, if you know the ASL alphabet, you can fingerspell
any word in the English language. Have fun!

ASL Numbers

merican Sign Language (ASL) numbers aren’t used much
when you’re signing with babies and toddlers. However, out
of curiosity, lots of people always ask me to show them some spe-
cific ASL number signs. So, just to pacify your curiosity, here are
the numbers one through ten, ASL-style (see Figures B-1 through 
B-10). Happy counting!

Appendix C
ASL Colors
C
olors are a vital part of children’s lives. Colors identify chil-
dren’s preferences — their very strong preferences. For exam-
ple, Sally only wears the green shirt, and Sarah only wears the pink
one. Or the blue bike is Bobby’s, and the red one is Billy’s. Or the
only color food that Margie will eat is orange because it’s her
favorite color, which requires you to explain to the pediatrician
and sundry nosy Nellies why her skin is tinged a bit orange, but
aren’t you glad she’s at least eating some veggies thrown in with
those orange cheesy chips?
A great game for you to play when she gets older is “I spy. . . .”
Finish the sentence by saying and signing a color (and eventually
just signing a color to exercise her memory banks). In the mean-
time, start by showing your baby or toddler her favorite colors with
signs. This appendix provides some basic colors to choose from.
Red
To sign RED, think about brushing the color on your lips:
Using the tip of your index finger, brush your lips two
times.
You’re making an ASL number ONE (see Appendix B) hand
shape as you brush your lips, and bringing it to an ASL
letter X (see Appendix A), as shown in Figure C-1.

Figure C-1: Red.
Pink
The sign for PINK uses the same hand movement as the sign for
RED (see the preceding section), except you use a different finger:
1. Make the sign for the ASL letter P (see Appendix A).
2. While holding that position, brush your middle finger
against your lips two times (see Figure C-2).
Part VI: Appendixes 
232

Figure C-2: Pink.
Orange
To sign ORANGE, pretend you’re squeezing the juice of an orange
into your mouth:
1. Make a claw-C hand shape (see Chapter 3) in front of
your lower face, thumb facing your mouth.
2. Close the claw-C hand shape into an ASL letter S (see
Appendix A) two times, as shown in Figure C-3.
Appendix C: ASL Colors 233

Figure C-3: Orange.
Yellow
Whether you’re singing about a yellow submarine or I Spying a
yellow banana peeking out of the fruit bowl, here’s how to two-step
the sign for YELLOW all the while:
1. Make an ASL letter Y (see Appendix A), palm facing away
from your body.
2. While holding that position, twist your hand at your wrist
a few times (see Figure C-4).
Part VI: Appendixes 
234

Figure C-4: Yellow.
Green
The color of money. The color of spring. The color of Kermit and of
emerald bling. Here’s how to sign GREEN:
1. Make an ASL letter G (see Appendix A), finger pointing
away from you.
2. While holding that position, twist your hand at your wrist
a few times (see Figure C-5).
Appendix C: ASL Colors 235

Figure C-5: Green.
Blue
Whether your sweetie loves blue because it’s the color of the
bright, clear sky or because she has blue eyes or because her very
first stuffed animal was blue, here’s how to show her the sign:
1. Make an ASL letter B (see Appendix A), palm facing away
from you.
2. While holding that position, twist your hand at your wrist
a few times (see Figure C-6).
Part VI: Appendixes 
236

Figure C-6: Blue.
Purple
Purple mountain majesties, purple dinosaurs, purple oopsy
bruises, purple grape-juiced lips. I can think of plenty of occasions
to sign PURPLE:
1. Make an ASL letter P (see Appendix A).
2. While holding that position, twist your hand back and
forth a few times (see Figure C-7).
Appendix C: ASL Colors 237

Figure C-7: Purple.
Brown
Go figure. To sign BROWN, you need to pretend you’re tracing a
sideburn on your cheek:
1. Make an ASL letter B (see Appendix A), palm facing out
with your thumb touching your temple.
2. While holding that position, slide your thumb down the
side of your face until your thumb is touching your jaw
(see Figure C-8).
Part VI: Appendixes 
238

Figure C-8: Brown.
Black
Signing BLACK is so easy that step-by-step directions aren’t neces-
sary. Just slide your index finger above both eyebrows (see Figure
C-9). That’s it. Well, maybe add in thoughts of a unibrow just for
kicks.
Figure C-9: Black.
Appendix C: ASL Colors 239

White
When there’s a baby or toddler in the house, white things don’t
tend to stay white for very long. But that’s beside the point, which
is simply how to sign (even not-so-bright) WHITE:
1. Place your hand flat in the middle of your chest.
2. Pull your hand away from you into a flat-O hand shape
(see Chapter 3), as shown in Figure C-10.
Figure C-10: White.
Colors
Sometimes you’ll want to communicate about colors in general
instead of talking and signing about one particular color. No problem.
When you make this sign, think of your individual fingers as vari-
ous different colors.
Part VI: Appendixes 
240

1. Make an open-5 hand shape (see Chapter 3), palm 
facing you.
2. Wiggle your fingers at your chin (see Figure C-11).
Figure C-11: Colors.
Rainbow
Rainbows are prominent in children’s décor, bedding, storybooks,
and coloring books. And seeing a real rainbow for the very first
time is quite a special moment. Be on the lookout for opportunities
to sign this beautiful phenomenon:
1. Make the sign for COLORS (see the preceding section).
2. Keeping an open-5 hand shape (see Chapter 3), turn your
palm facing out and draw an arc in the air to represent a
rainbow (see Figure C-12).
Appendix C: ASL Colors 241

Figure C-12: Rainbow.
Now go forth and color your world. Watch out! Baby may color the
walls instead.
