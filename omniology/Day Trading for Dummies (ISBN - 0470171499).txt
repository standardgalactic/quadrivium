Author’s Acknowledgments
So many wonderful people helped me with this book! I talked to many 
day traders, brokers, and others in the investment business, including 
Jack Alogna and Beth Cotner, Michael Browne of DTN Inc., Nihar Dalil, 
Greg Gocek and Robert Cohen of the CFA Society of Chicago, Mary Haffenberg
and Curt Zuckert at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Anil Joshi of NuFact,
Karen H. at Gamblers Anonymous, James Kupfer of Waterston Financial,
James Lee of TradersLaboratory.com, Wayne Lee of NASDAQ, Khurram Naik
and James Cagnina at Infinity Brokerage Services, Don Padou, Chris Tabaka,
Elizabeth Tabaka, and Allen Ward. I also talked to several other traders who
asked to remain anonymous; they know who they are, and I hope they also
know how much I appreciate their help. 
As for the mechanics of putting together the book, Corbin Collins and 
Stacy Kennedy of Wiley were great to work with through this tough 
schedule. (Dummies authors do not get to take time off!) Finally, my agent, 
Marilyn Allen, made it all happen.
Thanks, everyone!

Introduction
S
o you want to make money from home, eh?
If you love the thrill of the markets and have the patience to sit and stare at a
screen for hours waiting for the right moment to get in and get out of securi-
ties, then day trading might be a great career option. But it has risks, too. It
requires the right psychological makeup. Good day traders are patient and
decisive, confident but not arrogant. They most certainly are not gamblers,
although day trading attracts gamblers who discover it’s a great way to lose
money from home. Any day can be your best day, but it can also put you out
of business forever.
Day Trading For Dummies is for people who are looking for a career change or
who simply want to supplement investment return with new techniques. I
give you what you need to know, from determining whether you are cut out
for it, to laying out your home office, to researching and planning trades.
Maybe you’ll decide day trading is not for you — if so, you’ll be glad that you
spent only the price of this book and not thousands on research and training.
A lot of people make a lot of money selling services to neophyte day traders,
claiming to be the best thing going. And maybe so — for some people. I give a
wider perspective. If you decide to day trade, this book shouldn’t be your
only guide. Find a trading system that works for you.
About This Book
First, let me tell you what this book is not: It’s not a textbook, and it’s not a
guide for professional investors. Several of those are on the market already,
and they are fabulous — but often dry and assume underlying knowledge.
This book assumes you don’t know much about day trading, but that you are
a smart person who is thinking about doing it. It contains straightforward
explanations of how day trading works, how to get started, what the pitfalls
are, and what some of the alternatives are for your portfolio and for your
career. If you really want to read some textbooks, I list a few in the Appendix.

Conventions Used in This Book
I’ll start with the basics: I put important words that I define in italics. I often
bold the key words of lists to bring the important ideas to your attention.
And I place all Web addresses in monofont to set them apart.
I cover investment research in this book, and I make an effort to introduce
you to some technical terms that will come up in the investment world. You
don’t need to know everything in this book to day trade; most successful day
traders pick one system that works for them and stick to it. I think it’s helpful
to show the array of possibilities to help you make decisions about what
might suit you. Sometimes I throw in references to deeper, academic invest-
ment theories. To alert you to these topics, I flag them with Technical Stuff
icons (see the section “Icons Used in This Book”).
During printing of this book, some of the Web addresses may have broken
across two lines of text. If you come across such an address, rest assured
that I haven’t put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the
break. When using a broken Web address, type in exactly what you see on the
page, pretending that the line break doesn’t exist.
I include sidebars in the book that you don’t really need to read in order to
follow the chapter text. With that stated, though, I do encourage you to go
back and read through this extra material when you have the time. Many of
the sidebars contain practice examples that help you get an even better idea
of how some of the investment concepts work.
Foolish Assumptions
The format of this book requires me to make some assumptions about you,
the reader. I assume that you’re someone who needs to know a lot about day
trading in a short period of time. You may be considering a career change or
looking for a productive hobby in retirement, and you want to know how to
decide whether day trading is right for you. And if you determine that day
trading is right for you, you want to know how to get started, right down to
the setup for your computer monitors.
I assume that you’re someone who has extra money to trade (whether it’s
yours or not) and who wants to try day trading techniques to goose up your
portfolio returns. 
I also assume that you have some understanding of the basics of investing —
that you know what mutual funds and brokerage accounts are, for example. If
2
Day Trading For Dummies 

you don’t feel comfortable with that much, you may want to read Investing
For Dummies or Mutual Funds For Dummies and then come back here.
No matter your situation or motives, my goal is to give you enough informa-
tion so that you can ask smart questions, do careful research, and handle
your money so that you can meet your goals. And if you don’t have enough
money right now to make a living from day trading, I want you to discover
plenty of information from this book so that you will have it at the ready
someday. Some research and trading techniques used by day traders can
help you make better buy and sell decisions for the securities that you hold
now. You can find more strategies than you may expect.
How This Book Is Organized
Day Trading For Dummies is sorted into four parts so that you can find what
you need to know quickly.
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals
The first part describes what day trading is, how it works, and what basic
asset classes are used by day traders. It distinguishes between investing,
trading, and gambling; knowing which is which can help you avoid costly 
mistakes. And it covers regulatory issues that will affect you as a day trader.
Part II: Day Trading Tools
Here, you’ll find a guide to the practicalities: how to set up your office to
improve your response times; choose the support services you need to
research trades; get through the treacherous days with your sanity intact and
your positions under control; pay taxes on your gains; and figure out how
well you performed. This is the nitty-gritty, day-in-the-life stuff that separates
day trading from video games. (Because, yes, in some ways, they’re similar.)
Part III: Day Trading Strategies
This part is all about the different strategies and research techniques that
day traders use to determine where and when to buy and sell their positions.
This includes selling short to profit from securities that are declining in price
and using leverage to make bigger trades in hopes of bigger returns.

Introduction

The information here can help you make better portfolio decisions, even if
you decide not to become a day trader. And it’s just a start. The markets
teach traders new things every day, and the smart ones pay attention.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
In this . . . For Dummies-only part, you get to enjoy some top-ten lists. I pre-
sent ten reasons to day trade, ten reasons to avoid day trading, ten common
mistakes that day traders make, and ten alternative careers for people who
love the excitement of trading but who don’t want to work for themselves as
day traders.
I also include an Appendix full of references so that you can get more infor-
mation if you desire.
Icons Used in This Book
You’ll see four icons scattered around the margins of the text. Each icon
points out a certain type of information, most of which you should know or
may find interesting about day trading. They go as follows:
This icon notes something you should keep in mind about day trading. It may
refer to something I covered earlier in the book, or it may highlight some-
thing you need to remember for future investing decisions.
Tip information tells you how to invest a little better, a little smarter, a little
more efficiently. The information can help you make better day trades or ask
better questions of people who want to supply you with research, training,
and trading systems.
I’ve included nothing in this book that can cause death or bodily harm, as far as I
can figure out, but plenty of things in the world of day trading can cause you to
lose big money or, worse, your sanity. These points help you avoid big problems.
I put the boring (but sometimes helpful) academic stuff here. I even throw in a
few equations here and there. By reading this material, you get the detailed
information behind the investment theories or, sometimes, some interesting
trivia or background information.

Day Trading For Dummies 

Where to Go from Here
Well, open up the book and get going! Allow me to give you some ideas. You
may want to start with Chapter 1 if you know nothing about day trading so
you can get a good sense of what I’m talking about. If you need to get set up
to start trading, look at Chapters 6 and 7. If you want to know about some of
the potential problems in day trading, turn to Chapters 5, 8, 10, and 19. 
If you are thinking about day trading as a career, Chapter 2 describes what
day traders do all day, and Chapter 20 can give you some good alternatives.
For ideas about developing strategies, whether you’re going to hold for a few
minutes or several years, go to Part III. If you have a particular area of inter-
est, use the index and table of contents to go to the topic you want. If you’re
not sure, you may as well turn the page and start at the beginning.

ake money from the comfort of your home! Be your own boss! Beat the
market with your own smarts! Build real wealth! Tempting, isn’t it? Day
trading can be a great way to make money all on your own. It’s also a great
way to lose a ton of money, all on your own. Are you cut out to take the risk?
Day trading is a crazy business. Traders work in front of their computer screens,
reacting to blips, each of which represents real dollars. They make quick
decisions, because their ability to make money depends on successfully exe-
cuting a large number of trades that generate small profits. Because they
close out their positions in the stocks, options, and futures contracts they
own at the end of the day, some of the risks are limited. Each day is a new
day, and nothing can happen overnight to disturb an existing profit position. 
But those limits on risk can limit profits. After all, a lot can happen in a year,
increasing the likelihood that your trade idea will work out. But in a day? You
have to be patient and work fast. Some days there is nothing good to buy.
Other days it seems like every trade loses money. Do you have the fortitude
to face the market every morning?
In this chapter, I give you an overview of day trading. I cover what exactly
day traders do all day, go through the advantages and disadvantages of day
trading, cover some of the personality traits of successful day traders, and
give you some information on your likelihood of success.

You may find that day trading is a great career option that takes advantage of
your street smarts and clear thinking — or that the risk outweighs the poten-
tial benefits. That’s okay: The more you know before you make the decision
to trade, the greater the chance of being successful. If it turns out that day
trading isn’t right for you, you can apply strategies and techniques that day
traders use to improve the performance of your investment portfolio.
It’s All in a Day’s Work
The definition of day trading is that day traders hold their securities for only
one day. They close out their positions at the end of every day and then start
all over again the next day. By contrast, swing traders hold securities for days
and sometimes even months, whereas investors sometimes hold for years. 
The short-term nature of day trading reduces some risks, because there’s no
chance of something happening overnight to cause big losses. Meanwhile,
many investors have gone to bed, thinking their position is in great shape,
then woke up to find that the company has announced terrible earnings or
that its CEO is being indicted on fraud charges. 
But there’s a flip side (there’s always a flip side, isn’t there?): The day trader’s
choice of securities and positions has to work out in a day, or it’s gone. There’s
no tomorrow for any specific position. Meanwhile, the swing trader or the
investor has the luxury of time, as it sometimes takes a while for a position to
work out the way your research shows it should. In the long run, markets are
efficient, and prices reflect all information about a security. Unfortunately, it
can take a few days of short runs for this efficiency to kick in.
Day traders are speculators working in zero-sum markets one day at a time.
That makes the dynamics different from other types of financial activities you
may have been involved in.
When you take up day trading, the rules that may have helped you pick good
stocks or find great mutual funds over the years will no longer apply. This is a
different game with different rules.
Speculating, not hedging
Professional traders fall into two categories: speculators and hedgers. Specu-
lators look to make a profit from price changes. Hedgers are looking to protect
against a price change. They’re making their buy and sell choices as insurance,
10
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

not as a way to make a profit, so they choose positions that offset their expo-
sure in another market. For example, a food-processing company might look
to hedge against the risks of the prices of key ingredients — like corn, cook-
ing oil, or meat — going up by buying futures contracts on those ingredients.
That way, if prices do go up, the company’s profits on the contracts help fund
the higher prices that it has to pay to make its products. If the prices stay the
same or go down, it loses only the price of the contract, which may be a fair
tradeoff to the company. 
The farmer raising corn, soybeans, or cattle, on the other hand, would benefit
if prices went up and would suffer if they went down. To protect against a
price decline, the farmer would sell futures on those commodities. Then, his
futures position would make money if the price went down, offsetting the
decline on his products. And if the prices went up, he’d lose money on the
contracts, but that would be offset by his gain on his harvest.
The commodity markets were intended to help agricultural producers
manage risk and find buyers for their products. The stock and bond markets
were intended to create an incentive for investors to finance companies.
Speculation emerged in all of these markets almost immediately, but it was
not their primary purpose.
Markets have both hedgers and speculators in them. Day traders are all spec-
ulators. They look to make money from the market as they see it now. They
manage their risks by carefully allocating their money, using stop and limit
orders (which close out positions as soon as predetermined price levels are
reached) and closing out at the end of the night. Day traders don’t manage
risk with offsetting positions the way a hedger does. They use other tech-
niques to limit losses, like careful money management and stop and limit
orders (all of which you can learn about in Chapter 2).
Knowing that different participants have different profit and loss expecta-
tions can help a day trader navigate the turmoil of each day’s trading. And
that’s important, because to make money in a zero-sum market, you only
make money if someone else loses.
Understanding zero-sum markets
In a zero-sum game, there are exactly as many winners as losers. There’s no
net gain, which makes it really hard to eke out a profit. And here’s the thing:
Options and futures markets, which are popular with day traders, are zero-sum
markets. If the person who holds an option makes a profit, then the person
who wrote (which is option-speak for sold) that option loses the same amount.
There’s no net gain or net loss in the market as a whole.
11
Chapter 1: Wake Up to Day Trading

Now, some of those buying and selling in zero-sum markets are hedgers who
are content to take small losses in order to prevent big ones. Speculators may
have the profit advantage in certain market conditions. But they can’t count
on having that advantage all the time.
So who wins and loses in a zero-sum market? Some days, it all depends on luck,
but over the long run, the winners are the people who are the most disciplined.
They have a trading plan, set limits and stick to them, and can trade based on
the data on the screen — not based on emotions like hope, fear, and greed.
Unlike the options and futures markets, the stock market is not a zero-sum
game. As long as the economy grows, company profits will grow, and that will
lead to growing stock prices. There really are more winners than losers over
the long run. That doesn’t mean there will be more winners than losers today,
however. In the short run, the stock market should be treated like a zero-sum
market. 
If you understand how profits are divided in the markets that you choose to
trade, you’ll have a better understanding of the risks that you face as well as
the risks that are being taken by the other participants. People do make money
in zero-sum markets, but you don’t want those winners to be making a profit
off of you.
Some traders make money — lots of money — doing what they like. Trading
is all about risk and reward. Those traders who are rewarded risked the 80
percent washout rate. Knowing that, do you want to take the plunge? If so,
read on. And if not, read on anyway, as you might get some ideas that can
help you manage your other investments.
Keeping the discipline: 
closing out each night
Day traders start each day fresh and finish each day with a clean slate. That
reduces some of the risk, and it forces discipline. You can’t keep your losers
longer than a day, and you have to take your profits at the end of the day
before those winning positions turn into losers. 
And that discipline is important. When you are day trading, you face a market
that does not know and does not care who you are, what you are doing, or
what your personal or financial goals are. There’s no kindly boss who might
cut you a little slack today, no friendly coworker to help through a jam, no
great client dropping you a little hint about her spending plans for the next
fiscal year. Unless you have rules in place to guide your trading decisions,
you will fall prey to hope, fear, doubt, and greed — the Four Horsemen of
trading ruin.
12
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

So how do you start? First, you develop a business plan and a trading plan
that reflect your goals and your personality. Then, you set your working days
and hours and you accept that you will close out every night. Both of these
steps are covered in Chapter 2. As you think about the securities that you will
trade (Chapter 3) and how you might trade them (Chapters 12 and 13), you’ll
also want to test your trading system (Chapter 11) to see how it might work
in actual trading.
In other words, you do some preparation and have a plan. That’s a basic
strategy for any endeavor, whether it’s running a marathon, building a new
garage, or taking up day trading.
Committing to Trading as a Business
For many people, the attraction of day trading is that traders can very much
control their own hours. Many markets, like foreign exchange, trade around
the clock. And with easy Internet access, day trading seems like a way to
make money while the baby is napping, on your lunch hour, or working just a
few mornings a week in between golf games and woodworking.
That myth of day trading as an easy activity that can be done on the side
makes a lot of traders very rich, because they make money when traders who
are not fully committed lose their money. 
Day trading is a business, and the best traders approach it as such. They
have business plans for what they will trade, how they will in invest in their
business, and how they will protect their trading profits. So, much of this
book is about this business of trading: how to do a business plan (Chapter 2),
how to set up your office (Chapter 6), tax considerations (Chapter 10), and
performance evaluation (Chapter 11). If you catch a late-night infomercial
about trading, the story will be about the ease and the excitement. But if you
want that excitement to last, you have to make the commitment to doing
trading as a business to which you dedicate your time and your energy.
Trading part-time: an okay idea 
if done right
Can you make money trading part-time? You can, and some people do. To do
this, they approach trading as a part-time job, not as a little game to play
when they have nothing else to going on. A part-time trader may commit to
trading three days a week, or to closing out at noon instead of at the close of
the market. A successful part-time trader still has a business plan, still sets
13
Chapter 1: Wake Up to Day Trading

limits, and still acts like any professional trader would, just for a smaller part
of the day.
Part-time trading works best when the trader can set and maintain fixed busi-
ness hours. Your brain knows when it needs to go to work and concentrate
on the market, because the habit is ingrained. 
The successful part-timer operates as a professional with fixed hours. Think
of it this way: My son is a patient in a group pediatric practice that has some
part-time doctors. They keep set hours and behave like any other doctors in
the practice; it’s just that they do it for fewer hours each week. They commit
their attention to medicine when they are on the job, and patients only know
about their part-time hours when it comes time to make an appointment.
These doctors don’t pop into the office and start giving shots during their
lunch break from their “real” job, sneaking around so that their “real” boss
doesn’t find out. And what patient would want to be seen by a doctor who
won’t dedicate themselves to providing health care, even if it’s just for a few
hours a day?
If you want to be a part-time day trader, approach it the same way that a part-
time doctor, part-time lawyer, or part-time accountant would approach work.
Find hours that fit your schedule and commit to trading during them. Have a
dedicated office space with high-speed Internet access and a computer that
you use just for trading. If you have children at home, you may need to have
child care during your trading hours. And if you have another job, set your
trading hours away from your work time. Trading via cell phone during your
morning commute is a really good way to lose a lot of money (not to mention
your life if you try it while driving).
Trading as a hobby: a bad idea
Because of the excitement of day trading and the supposed ease of doing it,
you may be thinking that it would make a great hobby. If it’s a boring Saturday
afternoon, you could just spend a few hours day trading in the forex market
(foreign exchange), and that way you’d make more money than if you spent
those few hours playing video games! Right?
Uh, no.
Trading without a plan and without committing the time and energy to do it
right is a route to losses. Professional traders are betting that there will be
plenty of suckers out there, because that creates the losers that allow them
to take profits in a zero-sum market.
14
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

The biggest mistake an amateur trader can make is to make a lot of money
the first time trading. That first success was almost definitely due to luck,
and that luck can turn against a trader on a dime. If you make money your
first time out, take a step back and see if you can figure out why. Then test
your strategy, using Chapter 11 as a guide, to see if it’s a good one that you
can use often.
Yes, I have two warnings in this section, and for good reason: Successful day
traders commit to their business. Even then, most day traders fail in their
first year. Brokerage firms, training services, and other traders have a vested
interest in making trading seem like an easy activity that you can work into
your life. But it’s a job — a job that some people love, but a job nonetheless.
If you really love the excitement of the markets, there are ways to invest on a
hobbyist’s schedule. First, you can spend your time doing fundamental
research to find long-term investments, which is described a little bit in
Chapter 12. You can look into alternative investments to help diversify your
portfolio; Chapter 3 can get you started on that. You can also trade with play
money, either in demo accounts or in trading contests, to try out trading
without committing real money. Chapter 20 has some ideas on that.
Working with a Small Number of Assets
Most day traders pick one or two markets and concentrate on those to the
exclusion of all others. That way, they can learn how the markets trade, how
news affects prices, and how the other participants react to new information.
Also, concentrating on just one or two markets helps a trader maintain focus.
And what do day traders trade? Chapter 3 has information on all of the differ-
ent markets and how they work, but here’s a quick summary of the most pop-
ular assets with day traders right now:
 Financial futures: Futures contracts allow traders to profit from price
changes in such market indexes as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones
Industrial Average. They give traders exposure to the prices at a much
lower cost than buying all of the stocks in the index individually. Of
course, they tend to be more volatile than the indexes they track,
because they are based on expectations. 
 Forex: Forex, short for foreign exchange, involves trading in currencies
all over the world to profit from changes in exchange rates. Forex is the
largest and most liquid market there is, and it’s open for trading all day,
every day except Sunday. Traders like the huge number of opportuni-
ties. Because most price changes are small, they have to use leverage
15
Chapter 1: Wake Up to Day Trading

(borrowed money) to make a profit. The borrowings have to be repaid
no matter what happens to the trade, which adds to the risk of forex.
 Common stock: The entire business of day trading began in the stock
market, and the stock market continues to be popular with day traders.
They look for news on company performance and investor perception
that affect stock prices, and they look to make money from those price
changes. Day traders are a big factor in some industries, such as tech-
nology. The big drawback? Stock traders can get killed at tax time if they
are not careful. (See Chapter 10 for more information.)
Managing your positions
A key to successful trading is knowing how much you are going to trade and
when you are going to get out of your position. Sure, day traders are always
going to close out at the end of the day — or they wouldn’t be day traders —
but they also need to cut their losses and take their profits as they occur
during the day.
Traders rarely place all their money on one trade. That’s a good way to lose
it! Instead, they trade just some of it, keeping the rest to make other trades as
new opportunities in the market present themselves. If any one trade fails,
the trader still has money to place new trades. Some traders divide their
money into fixed proportions, and others determine how much money to
trade based on the expected risk and expected return of the security that
they are trading. Careful money management helps a trader stay in the game
longer, and the longer a trader stays in, the better the chance of making good
money. Chapter 2 has more information on this.
To protect their funds, traders use stop and limit orders. These are placed
with the brokerage firm and kick in whenever the security reaches a predeter-
mined price level. If the security starts to fall in price more than the trader
would like, bam! It’s sold, and no more losses will occur on that trade. The
trader doesn’t agonize over the decision or second-guess herself. Instead, she
just moves on to the next trade, putting her money to work on a trade that’s
likely to be better.
Day traders make a lot of trades, and a lot of those trades are going to be
losers. The key is to have more winners than losers. By limiting the amount
of losses, the trader makes it easier for the gains to be big enough to generate
more than enough money to make up for them. 
Focusing your attention
Day traders are often undone by stress and emotion. It’s hard, looking at
screens all day, working alone, to keep a steady eye on what’s happening in the
16
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

market. But traders have to do that. They have to concentrate on the market
and stick to their trading system, staying as calm and rational as possible.
Those who do well have support systems in place. They are able to close
their positions and spend the rest of the day on other activities. They do
something to get rid of their excess energy and clear their minds, such as
running or yoga or meditation. They understand that their ability to maintain
a clear mind when the market is open is crucial.
Traders sometimes think of the market itself, or everyone else who is trading,
as the enemy. The real enemies are emotions: doubt, fear, greed, and hope.
Those four feelings keep traders from concentrating on the market and stick-
ing to their systems.
One of the frustrations of trading is that some days, there will be more oppor-
tunities to trade than you have time or money to trade. Good trades are get-
ting away from you. You simply don’t have the resources to take advantage of
every opportunity you see. That’s why it’s important to have a plan and to
concentrate on what works for you.
Personality Traits of Successful 
Day Traders
Traders are a special breed. They can be blunt and crude, because they act
fast against a market that has absolutely no consideration for them. For all
their rough exterior, they maintain strict discipline about how they approach
their trading day and what they do during market hours.
The discipline begins with a plan for how to start the day, including reviews
of news events and trading patterns. It includes keeping track of trades made
during the day, to help the trader figure out what works and why. And it
depends on cutting losses as they occur, reaping all profits that appear, and
refining a set of trading rules so that tomorrow will be even better. No, it’s not
as much fun as just jumping in and placing orders, but it’s more likely to lead
to success.
Not everyone can be a day trader, nor should everyone try it. In this section I
cover some of the traits that make up the best of them. 
Independence
For the most part, day traders work by themselves. Although some cities
have offices for traders, known as trading arcades, the number of these places
has been declining over the years because the cost of setting up at home has
17
Chapter 1: Wake Up to Day Trading

gone down dramatically. Computers and monitors are relatively inexpensive,
high-speed Internet connectivity is easier to get, and many brokerage firms
cater to the needs of traders who are working by themselves.
So that leaves the day trader at home, alone, stuck in a room with nothing
but the computer screen for company. It can be boring, and it can make it
hard to concentrate. Some people can’t handle it.
But other traders thrive on being alone all day, because it brings out their
best qualities. They know that their trading depends on them alone, not on
anyone else. The trader has sole responsibility when something goes wrong,
but he also gets to keep all the spoils. He can make his own decisions about
what works and what doesn’t, with no pesky boss or annoying corporate
drone telling him what he needs to do today.
If the idea of being in charge of your own business and your own trading
account is exciting, then day trading might be a good career option for you.
And what if you want to trade but don’t want to be working by yourself?
Consider going to work for a brokerage firm, a hedge fund, a mutual fund, or a
commodities company. These businesses need traders to manage their own
money, and they usually have large numbers of people working together on
their trading desks to share ideas, cheer each other on, and give each other
support when things go wrong. 
No matter how independent you are, your trading will benefit if you have
friends and family to offer you support and encouragement. That network
will help you better manage the emotional aspects of trading. Besides, it’s
more fun to celebrate your success with someone else!
Quick-wittedness
Day trading is a game of minutes. An hour may as well be a decade when the
markets are moving fast. And that means a day trader can’t be deliberative or
panicky. When it’s time to buy or sell, it’s time to buy or sell, and that’s all
there is to it.
Many investors prefer to spend hours doing a careful study of a security and
markets before committing money. Some of these people are enormously suc-
cessful. Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, amassed $37 billion
from his careful investing style, money that he is giving to charity. But Buffett
and people like him are not traders.
Traders have to have enough trust in their system and enough experience in
the markets that they can act quickly when they see a buy or sell opportunity.
18
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

Many brokerage firms offer their clients demonstration accounts or backtest-
ing services that allow traders to work with their system before committing
actual dollars, helping them learn to recognize market patterns that signal
potential profits.
A trader with a great system who isn’t quick on the mouse button has another
option: automating trades. Many brokerage firms offer software that will exe-
cute trades automatically whenever certain market conditions occur. For many
traders, it’s a perfect way to take the emotion out of a trading strategy. Others
dislike automatic trading, because it takes some of the fun out of it. And let’s
face it, successful traders find the whole process to be a good time.
Decisiveness
Day traders have to move quickly, so they also have to be able to make deci-
sions quickly. There’s no waiting until tomorrow to see how the charts play
out before committing capital. If the trader sees an opportunity, she has to go
with it. Now.
But what if it’s a bad decision? Well, of course some decisions are going to be
bad. That’s the risk of making any kind of an investment, and without risk,
there is no return. Anyone playing around in the markets has to accept that.
But two good day trading practices help limit the effects of making a bad
decision. The first is the use of stop and limit orders, which automatically
close out losing positions. The second is closing out all positions at the end
of every day, which lets traders start fresh the next day.
If you have some downside protection in place, then it’s psychologically
easier to go ahead and make the decisions you need to make in order to make
a profit. And if you are one of those people who has a hard time making a
decision, day trading probably isn’t right for you.
What Day Trading Is Not
There is much mythology about day trading: Day traders lose money. Day
traders make money. Day traders are insane. Day traders are cold and ratio-
nal. Day trading is easy. Day trading is a direct path to alcoholism and ruin.
I’m going to bust a few day trading myths. Someone has to do it, right?
There’s both good news and bad news in this section, so read it through to
get some perspective on what, exactly, the day trader can expect from this
new endeavor. 
19
Chapter 1: Wake Up to Day Trading

It’s not investing . . .
Day traders never hold a position for more than a day. Swing traders hold
positions for a few days, maybe even a few weeks, but rarely longer than that.
Investors hold their stakes for the long term, with some looking to hang 
onto their securities for decades and maybe even hand them down to their
children.
Day trading is most definitely not investing. It’s an important function to the
capital markets because it forces the price changes that bring the supply and
demand of the market into balance, but it doesn’t create new sources of fund-
ing for companies and governments. It doesn’t generate long-term growth.
Many day traders withdraw their trading capital on a regular basis to put 
into investments, helping them build a long-term portfolio for their retirement
or for other ventures they might want to take on. There’s a good chance the
trader will have someone else manage this money, because investing and
trading have different mindsets.
But it’s not gambling . . . 
One of the biggest knocks on day trading is that it’s just another form of gam-
bling. And as everyone knows, or should know: In gambling, the odds always
favor the house. 
In day trading, the odds are even in many markets. The options and futures
markets, for example, are zero-sum markets with as many winners as losers,
but those markets also include people looking to hedge risk and who thus
have lower profit expectations than do day traders.
The stock market has the potential for more winning trades than losing
trades, especially over the long run, so it’s not a zero-sum market. The odds
are ever-so-slightly in the trader’s favor.
And in all markets, the prepared and disciplined trader can do better than
the frantic, naïve trader. That’s not the case when gambling, because no
matter how prepared the gambler is, the casino has the upper hand.
People with gambling problems sometimes turn to day trading as a socially
acceptable way to feed their addiction. If you know you have a gambling
problem or suspect you are at risk, it’s probably not a good idea to take up
day trading. Day traders who are closet gamblers tend to make bad trades
and have trouble setting limits and closing out at the end of the day. They
20
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

turn the odds against them. Chapter 4 has some information on the line
between day trading and gambling.
It’s hardly guaranteed . . . 
Given the participation of day traders in securities markets, researchers are
always trying to figure out whether they make money. And the answers aren’t
good. Here I review some of the literature to show you the current state of
day trading success rates. Note that they are low. Few people who take this
up succeed, in part because few people who take this up are prepared. And
even many of the prepared traders fail.
Much of the research covers performance in the late 1990s, when day trading
became wildly popular. It grew along with the commercial Internet, and it fell
out of favor when the Internet bubble burst. 
Day trading is difficult, but it is not impossible. You can improve your chances
of success by taking the time to prepare and by having enough money to fund
your initial trading account. During the first year, you’ll want to handle trad-
ing losses and still be able to pay your rent and buy your groceries. Knowing
that the basics of your life are taken care of will give you more confidence,
and that will help your performance. 
“Do Day Traders Make Money? Evidence from Taiwan”
This paper, written in 2004 by Brad Barber, Yi-Tsung Lee, Yu-Jane Liu, and
Terrance Odean (and available at http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/
odean/papers/Day%20Traders/Day%20Trade%20040330.pdf) found
that only 20 percent of day traders in Taiwan tracked between 1995 and 1999
made money in any six-month period, after considering transaction costs.
Median profits, net of costs, were U.S. $4,200 for any six-month period, although
the best traders showed semi-annual profits of $33,000. The study also found
that those who placed the most trades made the most money, possibly
because they are the most experienced traders in the group.
“Report of the Day Trading Project Group”
In 1999, the North American Securities Administrators Association, which
represents state and provincial securities regulators in the United States,
Canada, and Mexico, researched day trading so that its members could pro-
vide appropriate oversight. The report, which you can see at www.nasaa.
org/content/Files/NASAA_Day_Trading_Report.pdf, did not include
performance data. However, it cited several cases where brokerage firms
were sanctioned by regulators for misrepresenting their clients’ performance
numbers, including one firm that had no clients with profits.
21
Chapter 1: Wake Up to Day Trading

“Trading Profits of SOES Bandits”
Paul Schultz and Jeffrey Harris looked into the profits made by the so-called
SOES bandits, day traders who took advantage of loopholes that existed in
NASDAQ’s Small Order Entry System in the 1990s. These people were the first
day traders. Did they make money? The authors looked at a few weeks of
trade data from two different firms. What they found was that about a third of
all round-trip trades (buying and then later selling the same security) lost
money before commissions. Only a quarter of the round-trip trades had a
profit of $250 or more before commissions. The 69 traders in the study made
anywhere from one to 312 round-trip trades per week. They had an average
weekly profit after commission of $1,690; however, almost half of the traders,
34 of them, lost money in an average week.
You can see the abstract at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.
cfm?abstract_id=137949. The full article is available through many
libraries.
But it’s not exactly dangerous . . .
Yes, a lot of day traders lose money, and some lose everything that they start
out with. Many others don’t lose all of their trading capital; they just decide
that there are better uses of their time and better ways to make money.
A responsible trader works with risk capital, which is money that she can
afford to lose. She uses stop and limit orders to minimize her losses, and she
always closes out at the end of the day. She understands the risks and
rewards of trading, and that keeps her sane.
Many day trading strategies rely on leverage, which is the use of borrowed
money to increase potential returns. That carries the risk of the trader losing
more money than is in his account. However, the brokerage firm doesn’t want
that to happen, so it will probably close a leveraged account that’s in danger
of going under. That’s good, because it limits your potential loss.
It’s not easy . . . 
Along with the relatively low rate of success, day trading is really stressful. It
takes a lot of energy to concentrate on the markets, knowing that real money
is at stake. The profit amounts on any one trade are likely to be small, which
means the trader has to be persistent and keep placing trades until the end of
the day.
22
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

Some traders can’t handle the stress. Some get bored. Some get frustrated.
And some can’t believe that they can make a living doing something that 
they love.
But then, neither are a lot of 
other worthwhile activities
Day trading is tough, but many day traders can’t imagine doing anything else.
The simple fact is that a lot of occupations are difficult ways to make a living,
and yet they are right for some people. Every career has its advantages and
disadvantages, and day trading is no different.
When you finish this book, you should have a good sense of whether or not
day trading is right for you. If you realize that it’s the career you have been
searching for, I hope it leaves you with good ideas for how to get set up and
learn more so that you are successful.
And if you find that maybe day trading isn’t right for you, I hope you get some
ideas that can help you manage your long-term investments better. After all,
the attention to price movements, timing, and risk that is critical to a day
trader’s success can help any investor improve their returns. What’s not to
like about that? 
Putting day trading success 
rates in perspective
When I was doing research for this book, I talked to one very successful
trader who told me two things. First, he was suspicious of all the books and
training programs on day trading, because he didn’t think that they really
helped people learn to trade. Despite that, he liked that they existed, because
trading had proven to be a great way for him to make a good living and sup-
port his family, and he thought it would be great if those people who are cut
out for trading discovered the business.
Yes, most day traders fail — about 80 percent in the first year, as I noted 
earlier. But so do a large percentage of people who start new businesses or
enter other occupations. That’s why I’ve combed through several different
reports and databases to show how well people do in other fields. (My sources

D
ay trading is sometimes presented as a profitable hobby. Anyone who
buys a day trading DVD course via infomercial can make money easily
in just a few hours a week, right? Well, no. Day trading is a job. It can be a full-
time job or a part-time job, but it requires the same commitment to working
regular hours and the same dedication to learning a craft and honing skills as
any other job.
The best traders have plans for their business and for their trades. They
know in advance how they want to trade and what they expect to do when
they face the market. They may find themselves deviating from their plans at
times, due to luck or circumstance or changing markets, but in those cases at
least they understand why they are trying something else.
Failing to plan is planning to fail. And if you can’t remember that right now,
don’t worry. I repeat it several times in this book.
Here’s another reason for planning: Trading comes in many flavors, and many
of those who call themselves day traders are actually doing other things with
their money. If you know in advance what you want to do, you’ll be less likely
to panic or follow fads. You’ll be in a better position to take advantage of
opportunities in a way that suits your personality, trading skills, and goals.
And that’s why this entire chapter is devoted to planning.

Planning Your Trading Business
The day trader is an entrepreneur who has started a small business that
trades in securities in hopes of making a return. You’ll get your business off
to a good start if you have a plan for what you want to do and how you’re
going to do it. That way, you know what your goals are and what you need to
do to achieve them.
You can find a lot of sample business plans in books and on the Internet, but
most of them are not appropriate for a trader. A typical business plan is
designed to not only guide the business, but also to attract outside financing.
Unless you are going to take in partners or borrow money from an outside
source, your day trading business plan is for you only. No executive summary
and no pages of projections needed.
So what do you need instead? How about a list of your goals and a plan for
what you will trade, what your hours will be, what equipment you’ll need,
and how much to invest in the business?
Setting your goals
The first thing you need in your plan is a list of your goals, both short term
and long term. Here is a sample list to get you started:
 Where do you want to be in the next three months, six months, nine
months, a year, three years, five years, and ten years?
 How many days a year do you want to trade?
 What do you need to know to trade better?
 How much do you want to make?
 What will you do with your profits?
 How will you reward yourself when you hit your goals?
Be as specific as possible when you think about what you want to do with
your trading business and don’t worry if your business goals overlap 
with your personal goals. When you are in business for yourself, the two
often mix.
You might be tempted to say, “I want to make as much money as I possibly
can,” and forget the rest, but that’s not a goal that’s quantifiable. If you don’t
know that you’ve reached your goal, how can you go on to set new ones? And
if you don’t meet your goal, how will you know how to make changes?
26
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

Picking the markets
There are so many different securities and derivatives that you can day trade!
Sure, you want to trade anything that makes money for you, but what on earth
is that? Each market has its own nuances, so if you flit from futures to forex
(foreign exchange), you might be courting disaster. That’s another reason
why you need a plan. If you know what markets you want to trade, you’ll have
a better sense of what research services you’ll need, what ongoing training
you might want to consider, and how to evaluate your performance.
Chapter 3 covers different asset classes and how day traders might use them
in great detail. For now, Table 2-1 gives a little cheat sheet that covers those
that are most popular with day traders. Think about your chosen markets in
the same way: What do you want to trade, where will you trade it, what is the
risk and return, and what are some of the characteristics that make this
market attractive to you?
And what do zero sum, leverage, and upward bias mean? Well, zero sum
means that for every winner, there is a loser. There is no net gain in the market.
Leverage is the use of borrowed money, which increases potential return and
also increases risk. Upward bias means that in the long run, the market is
expected to increase in price, but that doesn’t mean it will go up on any given
day that you are trading.

Chapter 2: Making a Day Trade of It

The characteristics of the different markets and assets will affect both your
business plan and your trading plan. The business plan should include infor-
mation on what you will trade and why, as well as on what you hope to learn
to trade in the future. The trading plan looks at what you want to trade each
day and why, so that you can channel your efforts.
Many day traders work in a few different markets, depending on their tem-
perament and trading conditions, but successful traders have narrowed
down the few markets where they want to concentrate their efforts. Start
slowly, working just one or two different securities, but consider adding new
markets as your experience and trading capital grows.
Fixing hours, vacation, and sick leave
The markets are open more or less continuously. Although many exchanges
have set trading hours, there are traders working after hours who are willing to
sell if you want to buy. Some markets, such as foreign exchange, take only the
briefest of breaks over the course of a week. This gives day traders incredible
flexibility — no matter what hours and what days are best for you to trade, you
can find something that works for you. If you are sharpest in the evenings, you
might be better off trading Asian currencies, because those markets are active
when you are. Of course, this can be a disadvantage, because no one is setting
limits for you. Few markets are great places to trade every hour of every day.
If you want to, you can trade almost all the time. But you probably don’t want
to. To keep your sanity, maintain your perspective, and have a life outside of
your trading, you should set regular hours and stick to them. In your busi-
ness plan, determine when you are going to trade, how often you are going to
take a vacation, how many sick days you’ll give yourself, and how you’ll know
to take a day off. One of the joys of self-employment is that you can take time
off when you need to, so give yourself that little perk in your business plan.
Trading is a stressful business. You need to take time off to clear your head,
and you’ll probably find that working while sick is a sure-fire route to losses.
Build in some sick and vacation time — and read Chapter 8 for more informa-
tion on how to manage the stress of the markets.
Getting yourself set up
Part of your business plan should cover where you work and what equipment
you need. (Chapter 6 has some ideas on that subject.) What can you afford
now, and what is on your wish list? Do you have enough computing equip-
ment, the right Internet connection, and a working filing system? This is part
of your plan for getting your business underway, so put some thought into
your infrastructure.
28
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

And yes, this is important. You don’t want to lose a day of trading because
your computer has crashed, nor do you want to be stuck with an open posi-
tion because your Internet service provider has a temporary outage. And you
certainly don’t want to lose your concentration because you are trying to
work in the family room while other members of your household are playing
video games.
Investing in your business
You won’t have the time and money to do everything you want to do in your
trading business, so part of your business plan should include a list of things
that you want to add over time. A key part of that is continuous improvement:
No matter how good a trader you are now, you can always be better. Further-
more, the markets are always changing. New products come to market, new
trading regulations are passed, and new technologies appear. You will always
need to absorb new things, and part of your business plan should consider
that. Ask yourself
 What percentage of your time and trade gains will go into expanding
your knowledge of trading?
 Do you want to do that by taking seminars or by allocating the time to
simulation testing?
 What upgrades will you make to your trading equipment?
 How are you going to set yourself up to stay in trading for the long haul?
It takes money to make money — another cliché. It doesn’t mean that you
should spend money willy-nilly on any nifty gadget or fancy video seminar that
comes your way. Instead, it means that an ongoing, thoughtful investment in
your trading business will pay off in a greater likelihood of long-run success.
Evaluating and revising your plan
One component of your business plan should be a plan for revising it. Things
are going to change. You may be more or less successful than you hope, market
conditions may change on you, and you may simply find out more about how
you trade best. That’s why you should set a plan for updating your business
plan to reflect where you are and where you want to be as you go along. At
least once a year, and more often if you feel the need for a change, go through
your business plan and revise it to reflect where you are now. What are your
new goals? What are your new investment plans? What are you doing right,
and what needs to change?

A sample business plan
Not sure what should be in a business plan?
Here’s a sample to get you thinking about how
to plan your trading business.
Where I Am Now
I am about to start a career as a day trader. I
have $50,000 in capital that I can risk without
affecting my livelihood. I will rely on my spouse’s
job to cover our family spending needs and our
health insurance. This trading account will be
used to meet our long-term goals: paying off the
mortgage, sending the children to college,
paying for our retirement, and ultimately buying
a vacation house in the mountains. 
This business plan covers what I need to get
started.
My Business Goals
In three months, I will have spent $5,000 of 
my capital on a functional office and will have 
a tested trading strategy that works well in 
simulation.
In six months, I will be trading daily. I will have
lost no more than $5,000 of my trading capital.
In nine months, I will be trading daily, and I will
have more winning trades than losing trades.
In a year, I will have gained 10 percent on my
account. I will withdraw $1,000 to pay toward
our mortgage and another $1,000 toward an
ergonomic chair and other office equipment
upgrades. I will have mastered my first trading
system and will be testing a second one in order
to expand my trading opportunities.
In three years, my trading account will have
$150,000 in it from my trading successes, after
making investments in my business and paying
an additional $10,000 in principal on the mort-
gage. I will be trading three different systems
with satisfactory success.
In five years, I will have $300,000 in my trading
account. I will have made enough money to
have paid off our mortgage, after making regu-
lar payments on principal and interest every
month, paying $10,000 in year three, and paying
off the rest with the profits that I expect to earn
between years three and five. I will be known as
a successful trader. 
In ten years, I will have a second house, and I
will continue my record of trading success. I will
take $100,000 out of my trading account to cover
college tuition.
Markets Traded
My primary trading strategy will involve momen-
tum trades on the E-Mini S&P 500, E-Mini
NASDAQ, and E-Mini Russell 2000 futures con-
tracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. I will put no more than 10 percent of
my capital into any one trade and I will close out
positions each night.
I am interested in news-driven swing trading
(holding for short periods of time but longer than
a day) in large technology companies, so I will
research and test strategies with those. I am
also interested in trading Asian currencies, so I
will make the time to learn more about those
markets and determine if I can trade them effec-
tively during my preferred trading hours.
Trading Hours and Days
Because my primary strategy is equity driven, I
will trade only while the equity markets are
open, from 9:30 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. Monday
through Friday. I will spend an hour before the
markets open researching current trends and
news events so that I know what people will be
looking for that day. I will spend an hour after
the market closes doing paperwork and review-
ing the day’s trades.

Business plans are living documents. Use your plan to run your trading busi-
ness; as your business runs, use the results to update your plan. You can
keep the old ones around to show you how much progress you have made, if
you are so inclined.
Planning Your Trades
A good trader has a plan. She knows what she wants to trade and how to
trade it. She knows what her limits are before she places the order. She’s not
afraid to take a loss now in order to prevent a bigger loss in the future, and
she’s willing to sit out the market if nothing is happening that day. Her plan
gives her the discipline to protect her capital so that she has money in her
account to profit when the opportunities present themselves. 
31
Chapter 2: Making a Day Trade of It
I will take off three full weeks for vacation: the
week of my children’s spring break, a week in
August for a family vacation, and the last week
of December. I will also take off any day that I
am ill so that I can maintain my health and my
concentration.
My Business Setup
I work from a home office. I use my startup
funds to purchase two monitors working off of
one computer, with a second clone computer on
hand in case something goes wrong. I have
cable Internet access as well as a DSL backup
through my phone line. I have a wireless router,
so that I can check my email and instant mes-
sages through a third computer, a laptop,
instead of through my trading computer.
I have an account with a full-service online bro-
kerage firm that can offer me the necessary
research services. I also subscribe to Investor’s
Business Daily and The Wall Street Journal,
which I read each morning to help me gauge
sentiment. 
I track my trades on a paper form that I collect
in ring binders. I collect my other paperwork 
in ring binders that I keep on the shelf in my
office.
Investing in My Business
To stay successful in the long run, I need to keep
my skills sharp. To do this, I will read one book
on trading psychology or a successful trader’s
memoir each month. I will also work on simula-
tion trading for swing trading in technology
stocks, as I plan to add that to my trading
system.
As my trade profits grow, I will invest some of
them in trying new trading techniques, knowing
that I may have short-term losses until I under-
stand a market better. I will spend one day at the
end of each quarter on backtesting and simula-
tion of new strategies.
My wish list includes a more comfortable chair
for my office.
Evaluating my Business Plan
Before each vacation, I will read over this busi-
ness plan. I will use the time away from the mar-
kets to think about what changes I need to make
in it and will revise the plan upon my return.

In this section, I cover the components of trade planning. When you start
trading, you’ll probably write notes to set up a trading plan for each day that
covers what you expect for the day, what trades you hope to make, and what
your profit goals and loss limit are. As you develop experience, trade plan-
ning may become innate. You develop the discipline to trade according to
plan, without needing to write it all down — although you might find it useful
to tape a list of the day’s expected announcements to your monitor.
Like a business plan, a trading plan is flexible. The markets don’t know what
you’ve planned, and you’ll probably end up deviating on more than one occa-
sion. The key thing is knowing why you deviated: Was it because of the infor-
mation that you saw when you were looking at your screen, or was it because
you became panicky? 
What do you want to trade?
The first step in your trading plan should also be addressed in your business
plan: What is it that you want to trade? Many traders work in more than one
market, and each market is a little different. Some trade different products
simultaneously, whereas others choose one for the day and work only on that.
You need to figure out which markets give you the best chance of getting a
profit that day. It’s going to be different. Some days, no trades will be good for
you in one market. If you are too antsy for that, then find another market to
keep you busy so that you don’t trade just to stay awake. (Of course, many
traders report that the big money opportunities are in the slower, less glam-
orous markets.)
As a day trader, you are self-employed. You don’t answer to a boss and don’t
have to trade today if you don’t want to. So if you have a headache, or if no
good trades are available to you, or if recent losses have gotten you down,
take the day off and do something fun.
How do you want to trade it?
Figuring out how to trade an asset involves a lot of considerations: What is your
mood today? What will other traders be reacting to today? How much risk do
you want to take? How much money do you want to commit? This is the nitty-
gritty stage of trade planning that can help you manage your market day better.
Starting the day with a morning review
Before you start trading, take some time to determine where your head is rel-
ative to the market. Is today a day that you can concentrate? Are there things
32
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

happening in your life that might distract you, are you coming down with the
flu, or were you out too late last night? Or are you rearing to go, ready to take
on whatever the day brings? Your mindset should influence how aggressively
you want to trade and how much risk you want to take. You have to pay
attention to do well in the markets, but you also have to know when to hang
back during the day’s activities. For example, many traders find that their
strategies work best at certain times of the day, such as at the open or before
major news announcements.
Think about what people will be reacting to. Go through the newspapers and
check the online newswires to gather information. Then figure out the
answers to these questions:
 Are there big news announcements scheduled for today? At what time?
Do you want to trade ahead of the news or want to wait and see what
the market does? 
 Did something happen overnight? Will that affect trading on the open, or
is it already in the markets? Do you want to trade on the open or wait?
 What are the other people who trade the same future, commodity, stock,
or currency that you do worried about today? How are they likely to
respond? Do you want to go with the market or strike a contrary position?

check out www.tradethenews.com/weekly-calendar.php.
Drawing up a sample order
Once you have a sense of how you are going to tackle the day, you want to
determine how much you are going to trade. The key considerations are the
following:
 Do you want to be long or short? That is, do you want to bet that the
asset you are trading is going up in price or down?
 Do you want to borrow money? If so, how much? Borrowing — also
known as margin or leverage — increases your potential return as well
as your risk. (Margin, leverage, and short selling are discussed in
Chapter 14.)
Some contracts, such as futures, have built-in leverage. As soon as you
decide to trade them, you are borrowing money.
 How much money do you want to trade — in dollars, and as a percent-
age of your total account size? (Money management is discussed in
detail in Chapter 9.)
Once you have those items detailed, you’re in good shape to get started for
the day.

Chapter 2: Making a Day Trade of It

Figuring out when to buy and when to sell
Once you get insight into what the day might be like and how much money
you want to allocate to the markets, your next step is to figure out when you
will buy and when you will sell. Ah, but if that were easy, do you think I’d be
writing a book on day trading? No. If knowing when to buy and sell were easy,
I would be too busy taking private surfing lessons in front of my beachfront
mansion on Maui to be writing a book.
The very best traders aren’t selling trading advice, because they are already
retired. Everyone else is figuring it out as they go along, with varying degrees
of success. 
Many traders rely on technical analysis, which involves looking at patterns 
in charts of the price and volume changes. I discuss technical analysis in
Chapter 12. Other traders look at news and price information as the market
changes, rather than looking at price patterns, and that’s discussed in Chap-
ter 13. Still others care only about very short-term price discrepancies, cov-
ered in Chapter 14. But the most important thing, no matter what approach
you prefer, is that you backtest and simulate your trading before you commit
real dollars. That way, you have a better sense of how you’ll react in real
market conditions. That key step is covered in Chapter 11.
Setting profit goals
When you trade, you want to have a realistic idea how much money you can
make. What’s a fair profit? Do you want to ride a winning position until the
end of the day or do you want to get out quickly once you’ve made enough
money to compensate for your risk? There’s no one answer to this question,
as so much depends on market conditions and your trading style. In this sec-
tion are some guidelines that can help you determine what’s best for you. 
But first, I take a detour and define all the different terms for profits that you
might come across.
The language of money
Profits are discussed differently in different markets, and you may as well
have the right lingo when you write your plan:
 Pennies: Stocks trade in decimal form, so each price movement is worth
at least a penny — one cent. It’s an obvious way to measure to a profit. 
 Pips: A pip is the smallest unit of currency that can be traded. In foreign
exchange markets (forex), a pip is generally equal to one one-hundredth
34
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

of a cent. If the value of the euro moves from $1.2934 to $1.2935, it has
moved a pip. 
Do not confuse a pip in the forex market with an investment scheme
known as PIP, sometimes called People in Profit or Pure Investor. (The
fraud also operates as HYIP, for High Yield Investment Program.) PIP has
been promoted as a trading system with a guaranteed daily return, but
it’s really a pyramid scheme that takes money from participants and
returns little or nothing. You can get more information from the SEC’s
Web site, www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/primebank.shtml.
 Points: A point is a single percentage. A penny is a point, as is a 1 per-
cent change in a bond price. A related number, a basis point, is a percent
of a percent, or .0001. 
 Teenies: Many securities, especially bonds and derivatives on them,
trade in increments of 1⁄8 of a dollar. Half of an eighth is a sixteenth, also
known as a teeny. 
 Ticks: A tick is the smallest trading increment in a futures contract. It
varies from product to product. How much it works out to be depends
on the contract structure. For the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s E-Mini
S&P 500 contract, a tick is equal to $12.50, calculated as a 0.25 change in
the underlying S&P 500 index multiplied by $50 multiplier. A tick on a
Chicago Board of Trade E-Mini soybean contract is $1.25, calculated as
1/8 cent on a bushel of soybeans in a contract covering 1000 bushels.
You can get information on the tick size of contracts that interest you on
the Web site of the offering exchange, which are listed in Chapter 3.
No one ever lost money taking a profit, as the cliché goes. (The trading busi-
ness is rife with clichés, if you haven’t noticed.) The newer you are to day
trading, the more sense it makes to be conservative. Close your positions and
end your day when you reach a target profit — and then make note of what
happens afterward. Can you afford to hold on to your positions longer in
order to make a greater profit?
Thinking about profits
Your profit goals can be sliced and diced a few different ways. The first is the
gain per trade, on both a percentage basis and an absolute basis. The second
is the gain per day, on both a percentage basis and an absolute basis. What
do you have to do to reach these goals? How many successful trades will you
have to make? Do you have the capital to do that? And what is right for the
trade you are making right now, regardless of what your longer-term goals are?
Setting limits on your trades
It’s a good idea to set a loss limit along with a profit goal.
35
Chapter 2: Making a Day Trade of It

For example, many futures traders have a rule to risk two ticks in pursuit of
three ticks. That means that they will sell a position as soon as it loses two
ticks in value, and they will also sell a position as soon as it gains three ticks
in value. And for anything in between? Well, they close out their positions at
the end of the day, so whatever happens happens.
Even traders who do not have a rule like that often set a limit on how much
they will lose per trade. Other traders use computer programs to guide their
buys and their sells, so they need to sell their positions automatically. Brokers
make this easy by giving customers the choice of a stop order or a limit order
to protect their positions.
You want to limit your loss per trade as well as your loss per day. If today is
not a good one, close up shop, take a break, and come back fresh tomorrow.
Stop orders 
A stop order, also known as a stop loss order, is an order to sell a security at
the market price as soon as it hits a predetermined level. If you want to make
sure you sell a block of stock when it falls below $30 per share, for example,
you could enter a stop order at $30 (telling your broker “Sell Stop 30”). As
soon as the stock hits $30, the broker sells it, even if the price goes to $29 or
$31 before all the stock is sold. 
Limit orders
A limit order is an order to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better:
lower than the current price for the buy order, higher than the specific price
for a sell order. If you want to make sure you sell a block of stock when it falls
below $30 per share, for example, you could enter a limit order at $30 (telling
your broker “Sell Limit 30”). As soon as the stock hits $30, the broker sells it,
as long as the price stays at $30 or higher. If the price goes even a penny below
$30, the limit is no longer enforced. After all, no buyers are going to want to
pay an above-market price just so you can get your order filled all the way!
Stop limit orders
A stop limit order is a combination of a stop order and a limit order. It tells 
the broker to buy or sell at a specific price or better, but only after the price
reaches a given stop price. If you want to make sure you sell a block of stock
when it falls below $30 per share, but you do not want to sell it if it starts to
go back up, for example, you could enter a stop order at $30 with a limit of
$31 (telling your broker “Sell 30 Limit 31”). As soon as the stock hits $30, the
broker sells it as long as the price stays under $31. If the price goes above
$31, the order is no longer enforced. There’s a very small price range where
this order will be executed.
Are you confused? Well, the differences may be confusing, but understanding
them is important to helping you manage your risks. That’s why Table 2-2 is a
handy break-out of the different types of orders.

What if the trade goes wrong?
No matter how in tune you feel with the market, no matter how good your
track record, and no matter how disciplined you are with setting stops, stuff
is going to happen. Just as you can make more money than you plan to, you
can also lose a lot more. If you are going to day trade, you have to accept that
there are going to be some really bad days. 
37
Chapter 2: Making a Day Trade of It

So what do you do? You suck it up, take the loss, and get on with your life.
Yes, the market may have blown past your stops. That happens sometimes,
and it’s hard to watch real dollars disappear into someone else’s account,
someone you will never know. Still, close your position and just remember
that tomorrow is another day with another chance to do better.
Don’t hold in hopes of making up a loss. The market does not know what you
own and will not reward your loyalty and best hopes. 
38
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 
A sample trading plan
A trading plan may only be good for a short time,
but having an idea of what to expect in the
market and how you will react goes a long way
toward keeping trading discipline, which
improves your likelihood of long-run profits.
What does such a plan look like? Well, here’s a
sample to get you started.
What I’m Trading Today
Today, I’ll be trading the E-Mini S&P 500 futures.
They closed down yesterday, but I’m expecting
an uptick in the market today as companies
report good earnings, so I am going to trade on
the long side. My plan is to start the day buying
two contracts with stop orders to sell if they
decline more than three ticks each. These con-
tracts will remain open until the end of the day
unless the stop is reached. I will add a third con-
tract if the market shows momentum in the
morning and a fourth contract if it shows
momentum in the afternoon. These two addi-
tional contracts can be long or short, depend-
ing on the market direction, although it is
unlikely that the purchasing manager or home
sales surveys will have a large effect on the
market’s direction. (Naturally, I will not take out
a short contract during the day if my two initial
long contracts are still open.) I will close all
positions at the end of the day, if not sooner.
Because the margin on each contract is $3,500,
my maximum exposure today will be approxi-
mately 28 percent of my total account, with no
contract accounting for more than 7 percent of
my account.
Today’s Expected News Announcements
Before the open: earnings announcements from
ADM (expect $0.62), PG (expect $0.74)
10:00 a.m. ISM Index — survey of purchasing
managers — market expects 51.0
10:00 a.m. Pending Home Sales — market
expects up 0.5 percent
After the close: earnings announcements from
UA (expect $0.20), MET (expect $1.29)
5:00 p.m. Auto Sales — market expects 5.1m
5:00 p.m. Truck Sales — market expects 7.2m
My Profit and Loss Goals for the Day
My profit goal is five ticks or $62.50 per contract
traded, for a target of $250 if I acquire my
planned maximum of four contracts, but I plan
to ride my profits until the end of the day. If all
four contracts decline in value, I will close when
they fall three ticks apiece, for a maximum loss
of $37.50 per contract or $150 for the day.

After you take the loss and clear your head, see if there is something you can
learn for next time. Sometimes a loss can teach you valuable lessons that
make you a smarter, more disciplined trader in the long run.
Closing Out Your Position
By definition, day traders only hold their investment positions for a single
day. This is important for a few reasons:
 Closing out daily reduces your risk of something happening overnight.
 Margin rates — the interest rates paid on money borrowed for trading —
are low and in some cases zero for day traders, but the rates go up on
overnight balances.
 It’s good trade discipline that can keep you from making expensive 
mistakes.
But like all rules, the single day rule can be broken and probably should be
broken sometimes. In this section, I cover a few longer-term trading strate-
gies that you may want to add to your trading business on occasion.
Swing trading: holding for days
Swing trading involves holding a position for several days. Some swing traders
hold overnight, whereas others hold for days or even months. The longer
time period gives more time for a position to work out, which is especially
important if it is based on news events or if it requires taking a position con-
trary to the current market sentiment. Although swing trading gives traders
more options for making a profit, it carries some risks because the position
could turn against you while you are away from the markets. 
There’s always a tradeoff between risk and return. When you take more risk,
you do so in the hopes of getting a greater return. But when you look for a
way to increase return, remember that you will have to take on more risk to
do it.
Swing trading requires paying attention to some basic fundamentals and
news flow. (Fundamental research is discussed in Chapter 12.) It’s also a good
choice for people who have the discipline to go to bed at night instead of
waiting up and watching their position in hopes that nothing goes wrong. 
39
Chapter 2: Making a Day Trade of It

Position trading: holding for weeks
A position trader holds a stake in a stock or a commodity for several weeks
and possibly even for months. This person is attracted to the short-term
price opportunities, but he also believes that he can make more money hold-
ing the stake for a long enough period of time to see business fundamentals
play out. This increases the risk and the potential return, because a lot more
can happen over months than minutes.
Investing: holding for months or years
An investor is not a trader. Investors do careful research and buy a stake in an
asset in the hopes of building a profit over the long term. It’s not unusual for
investors to hold assets for decades, although good ones sell quickly if they
realize that they have made a mistake. (They want to cut their losses early,
just as any good trader should.)
Investors are concerned about the prospects of the underlying business. Will
it make money? Will it pay off its debts? Will it hold its value? They view
short-term price fluctuations as noise rather than as profit opportunities.
Many traders pull out some of their profits to invest for the long term (or to
give to someone else, such as a mutual fund manager or hedge fund, to
invest). It’s a way of building financial security in the pursuit of longer goals.
This money is usually kept separate from the trading account.
Maxims and Clichés that Guide 
and Mislead Traders
In this chapter, I cover a few of the many maxims traders use to think about
their trading, such as
 The stock doesn’t know you own it.
 Failing to plan is planning to fail.
 Your first loss is your best loss.
A lot more are out there.
40
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

Clichés are useful shorthand for important rules that can help you plan your
trading. But they can also mislead you because some are really obvious —
too obvious to act on effectively. (Yes, we all know that you make money by
buying low and selling high, but how do you tell what low is and high is?)
Here’s a run-through of some that you’ll come across in your trading career,
along with my take on what they mean. 
Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered
Trading is pure capitalism, and people do it for one primary reason: to make
money. Sure, a ton of economic benefits come from having well-functioning
capital markets, such as better price prediction, risk management, and capi-
tal formation. But a day trader just wants to make money. 
However, get too greedy, and you’re likely to get stupid. You start taking too
much risk, deviating too much from your strategy, and getting careless about
dealing with your losses. Good traders know when it’s time to take a profit
and move on to the next trade.
This is also a good example of an obvious but tough-to-follow maxim. When
are you crossing from being a happy little piggy to a big fat greedy hog that’s
about to be turned into a pork belly? Just know that if you are deviating from
your trading plan because things are going so great, you might be headed for
some trouble. 
In a bear market, the money 
returns to its rightful owners
A bull market is one that charges ahead; a bear market is one that does
poorly. Many people think they are trading geniuses because they make
money when the entire market is going up. It was easy to make money day
trading Internet stocks in 1999, but it wasn’t so easy in 2000 when the bubble
burst. And when the markets turn negative, those people who really under-
stand trading and who know how to manage risk will be able to stay in until
things get better, possibly even making nice profits along the way.
The corollary cliché for this is “Don’t confuse brains with a bull market.” When
things are going well, watch out for overconfidence. It might be time to update
your business and trading plans, but it’s not to time to cast them aside.
41
Chapter 2: Making a Day Trade of It

The trend is your friend
When you day trade, you need to make money fast. You do not have the
luxury of waiting for your unique, contrary theory to play out. An investor
may be buying a stock in the hopes of holding it for decades, but a trader
needs things to work now.
Given the short-term nature of the market, the short-term sentiment is going
to trump long-term fundamentals. People trading today may be wrong about
the direction of foreign exchange, interest rates, or stock prices, but if you
are closing out your positions tonight, you need to work with the information
in the market today.
In the short run, traders who fight the market lose money.
There are two problems with The trend is your friend. The first is that by the
time you identify a trend, it may be over. Second, there are times when it
makes sense to go against the herd, because you can collect when everyone
else realizes their mistakes. This is where the psychology of trading comes
into play. Are you a good enough judge of human behavior to know when the
trend is right and when it’s not?
Buy the rumor, sell the news
Markets react to information. That’s ultimately what drives supply and
demand. Although the market tends to react quickly to information, it can
overreact, too. Lots of gossip gets traded in the markets as everyone looks to
get the information they need in order to gain an advantage in the markets.
And despite such things as confidentiality agreements and insider-trading
laws, many rumors turn out to be true.
These rumors are often attached to such news events as corporate earnings.
For whatever reason — good news, analyst research, a popular product —
traders might believe that the company will report good quarterly earnings
per share. That’s the rumor. If you buy on the rumor, you can take advantage
of the price appreciation as the story gets more play.
When the earnings are actually announced, one of two things will happen:
 They will be as good as or better than rumored, and the price will go up.
The trader can sell into that and make a profit.
 They will be worse than rumored, everyone will sell on the bad news,
and the trader will want to sell to get out of the loss.
42
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

Of course, if the rumor is bad, you want to do the opposite: sell on the rumor,
and buy on the news. For more information on short selling — selling securi-
ties in hopes that they fall in price — turn to Chapter 14. 
The problem with Buy the rumor, sell the news is that rumors are often wrong,
and there may be more opportunities to buy on bad news when other traders
are panicking, thus driving prices down for a few minutes before sanity sets
in. But it’s one of those rules that everyone talks about, whether or not they
actually follow it.
Cut your losses and ride your winners
I mentioned already in this chapter that you need to cut your losses before
they drag you down. No matter how much it hurts and no matter how much
you believe that you are right, you need to close out a losing position and
move on. 
But the opposite is not necessarily true. Although good traders tend to be
disciplined about selling winning positions, they don’t use stops and limits as
rigorously on the upside as they might on the downside. They’re likely to
stick with a profit and see how high it goes before closing out a position.
Note that this conflicts a little with Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered. Trading
maxims can be so contradictory! To prevent overconfidence and sloppiness
from greed, ride your winners within reason. If your general discipline is to
risk three ticks on a futures contract in order to make five, and a contract
goes up six ticks before you can close it out, you might want to stick with it.
But if you also close out at the end of every day, don’t give in to the tempta-
tion of keeping that position open just because it’s still going up. Keep to
your overall discipline. 
You’re only as good as your last trade
The markets churn on every day with little regard for why everyone trading
right now is there. Prices go up and down to match the supply and the
demand at any given moment, which may have nothing to do with the actual
long-term worth of an item being traded. And it certainly has nothing to do
with how much you really, really want the trade to work out.
One of the biggest enemies of good traders is overconfidence. Especially after
a nice run of winning trades, a trader can get caught up in the euphoria and
believe that he finally has the secret to successful trading under control.
43
Chapter 2: Making a Day Trade of It

While he’s checking the real estate listings for that beachfront estate in Maui,
BAM! The next trade is a disaster. 
Does that mean that the trader is a disaster, too? No, it just means that the
markets won this time around.
Most day traders are working in zero-sum markets, which mean that for
every winner, there is a loser. Hence, not everyone can make money every
day. The challenge is to maintain an even keel so as not to be distracted by
confidence when the trading is going well or by fear when the trading is going
poorly. The next trade is a new trade.
A Day in the Life of a Trader
What’s it like being a day trader? James Okada Lee, a day trader in Tokyo 
and proprietor of the Traders Laboratory (www.traderslaboratory.com)
answered a few questions about what he does and why he does it. “I trade
the U.S. markets from Tokyo, which means I work from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. 
every day. Most people think I am insane, but I got used to it after two years,”
he says.
Q: What do you trade, and how long have you been trading? 
I currently specialize in Chicago Mercantile Exchange eMini futures contracts,
especially the eMini Dow and Russell contracts. I have been trading for four
years now. Before that, I was a professional poker player, which has helped
me tremendously in the mental aspects of trading. 
I was introduced to trading through a poker buddy of mine when I was 20. He
had a friend who was a full-time day trader at 22. I visited his office (he was a
prop trader) and that day was the day my life made a complete 360. I remem-
ber clearly walking in to the office and seeing a 12-monitor setup with charts,
Level 2 quotations, and blinking lights. It was then I decided that I was going
to be a day trader and do whatever it takes to be good at it.
One of the biggest reasons why I decided to become a trader was because I
felt I had a psychological edge over other people. I spent hours analyzing my
poker game for why I was able to consistently win. The biggest reason was
player psychology. I kept winning because my psychological makeup was
stronger than that of the other players on the table. I understood that poker
was a game of patience and discipline. I was also good in reading people and
questioning every single move they make. I would constantly ask myself: Why
did he spend an extra 20 seconds to bet? Does he look nervous? Why did he
take a deeper drag from his cigarette? Did his pupils get wider? Why is he 
44
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

betting smaller than usual? Why is he betting bigger than usual? And so on.
These questions help me analyze a player for clues of weakness or strength. 
Now, these questions are related when it comes to trading. As a day trader I
constantly ask myself: What is the market trying to do now? Is there price
acceptance or rejection outside of value? Is the market running out of momen-
tum? Is the market being supported only by small buyers? Are we likely to
test the overnight high or the previous day high? Is there selling volume at a
key pivot level? What is the tape telling me? And so on. These questions help
me understand the language of the markets. What I’m trying to do is follow
the big buyers and sellers and decide what they are trying to do, which is
similar to reading my opponents in poker.
Q: How did you get started trading?
I never had an opportunity to learn directly from a trader or trading mentor,
so 90 percent of my trading was self-taught through trial and error. I commit-
ted every amateur mistake in my first year of trading: selling lows, buying
highs, using lagging indicators, trading without a plan, not understanding sig-
nificant support and resistance levels, not understanding the basic concept
of supply and demand. As an amateur I thought I had to short because the
price was too high or buy because price was too low. How foolish I was! I
blew my first trading account in six months. 
To get back in, I built a stake through poker and took an office job with an IT
company. I was in Tokyo then, and my job had night hours, 9 p.m. to 9 a.m. local
time (7 a.m. to 7 p.m. EST). My boss worked daytime hours, so I was alone. I
wasn’t able to install my trading software on the office computers, so what I
did was watch a simple bar chart on a browser (www.futuresource.com)
with 15-minute delayed data. I would refresh my browser every 15 minutes to
see how the price changed while I worked. This weird method of observation
helped build my trading style today.
What I did was use simple Support and Resistance levels on my charts. Since
all I could see was a bar chart (no volume, no indicators) the only thing I
could do was imagine what price would do in the next 15 minutes when I
would refresh my browser. I focused on confluence areas: in other words
cluster points of various support and resistance levels, such as pivot points
lined up with previous day high/low, weekly pivots lined up with daily pivots,
50-percent range lined up with pivots, and so on. This became the foundation
of my trading. I was getting good at identifying these levels of support and
resistance, and more often I saw price move the way I had anticipated. This
went on for 10 months, 12 hours a day, 24–26 working days a month. 
After 10 months I went back to trading full time. I started reading the time of
sales tape and created my edge by looking at support and resistance levels
45
Chapter 2: Making a Day Trade of It

and deciding whether the price was going to hold or break according to the
tape. Very simple, but it took quite a while to reach this level of simplicity.
Q: Do you close out trades every day, or do you carry some over?
I never hold any overnight positions. I’m based in Tokyo — a 13-hour time dif-
ference with New York. So I trade the morning session only 70 percent of the
time. I prefer to start each day fresh. It’s like getting dealt a new hand. 
Q: What piece of equipment or software could you not do without?
Day traders need to be techies. I use four 17-inch LCD monitors and have two
Internet providers in case one goes down. In my opinion, day traders need at
least two monitors (I recommend more), a fast Internet connection, and a
decent computer with at least 1 GB of RAM. I also have several whiteboards
on my wall to post notes of various price levels for the day. I currently use
TradeStation (www.tradestation.com) for my charting software — definitely
something I cannot live without. My job only exists because of advancement in
technology. I couldn’t possibly do what I do now 20 years ago. 
So execution is very important. There are various platforms day traders can
use to execute orders. But it is very important that the execution platform
allows advanced orders, such as OCO (one cancels the other), bracket orders,
and OSO (order sends order) If a platform has the ability to place an automatic
stop or target, it makes the life of a day trader much easier. Energy is wasted in
manually putting a stop. It can also affect the trader psychologically. 
Day traders need a good charting package and good execution software.
Software fees can be costly but it’s all a part of the expense in this business. 
Q: What is a typical day like? How easy is it to quit at the end of the day? 
I tend to be a workaholic, so a typical day is pretty intense. I wake up around
1 p.m. Tokyo time (12 a.m. EST). The first thing I do is to check my charts, my
Web site (www.traderslaboratory.com), and my trades from the day before.
I have a poker habit in that I tend to think about my trades (hands for poker) all
throughout the day. Analyzing yourself is very important in both trading and
poker. I may decide to go to the gym during this time, but by 9 p.m. Tokyo
time (7 a.m. EST) I am back at my desk, concentrating on the upcoming ses-
sion. From 1 p.m. to 9 p.m., I work about 5–6 hours. I do not have a TV or a
phone in my office space, which allows me to concentrate 100 percent on my
work. (I tend to get extremely carried away with work and time flies without
even noticing.) Once the markets open, I am trading until 1 a.m. Tokyo time
(11 a.m. EST). If I choose to come back for the afternoon, I will take a break
until 4 a.m. Tokyo time (2 p.m. EST) and then resume trading. If I met my
daily in the morning, I am usually done by 1 a.m. Tokyo time (11 a.m. EST). 
46
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

It is relatively easy for me to quit trading during the day whenever I want. I
am very aware of my own mental level in terms of fatigue and do not trade
when I am tired. I learned this habit from poker when I used to play 12-hour
sessions daily. Fatigue turns into mistakes. And mistakes are very costly in
this game. It is quite contrary to what people may assume, since I trade
during the night hours. While U.S. traders have the luxury of calling it a day
and playing golf, the city is pretty much dead here during my working hours. 
Q: What is your secret to managing the stress of trading?
I use several methods to handle stress. I am a student of neuro-linguistic 
programming, and I use a lot of visualization techniques to ease my mind.
Meditation and self-hypnosis also work to clear my mind from any thoughts,
positive and negative. Another weird method I use is watching bad movies
with Chuck Norris, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, or Jean-Claude
Van Damme. Almost any movie with those actors in it is horrible, and for a
full two hours I don’t have to use my head. Very relaxing in my opinion!
As much as I work, I always take a regular weekly break. Every Saturday I am
out partying with friends. I find these moments necessary to eliminate a lot of
the work stress. Other than that, I do not have break times and I have not
gone on vacation in over six years. 
Q: What’s your best piece of advice for someone considering day trading?
It is important to know yourself. Without understanding who you are and
what kind of trader you are, you are doomed to fail. You have to know your
time frame and style as a trader. Once you find your style of trading, you
must become an expert in it and have an edge. New traders tend to jump
from one style to the next in search for the Holy Grail. There is no Holy Grail
in trading. One needs to understand that trading is a game of probabilities
and psychology. The futures market is a zero-sum game. One person’s mis-
take is another man’s profit. Do not treat trading as a hobby. Hobbies cost
money. Trading should be treated as a full-time job and business. 
Second, specialize in one market first. Know the market inside out instead of
jumping around. A trader must find a market that fits his style also. This is
why the trader needs to know who he is first before engaging in the markets.
It is also important to be in sync with the markets. A trader who is completely
absorbed with his or her market of choice is able to read the language of the
markets. Whenever I feel out of sync and unclear about market direction, I
will spend the time to observe until I have a clearer understanding.
Third, learn the psychology of the markets. There are the short-term market
participants and the long-term market participants. The short-term trader
may be looking to make money in the next 5 to 30 minutes. The long-term
47
Chapter 2: Making a Day Trade of It

trader may be looking to make money in the next 3–5 weeks. Both traders are
trying to profit under the same rules of the market. In the futures market, for
every buyer there must be a seller. Under the same exact information, they
have a difference in opinion. Now, if Trader A buys from Trader B, Trader A
must sell in order to profit or to cut losses short. If the market goes against
Trader A, where will he sell? It’s the simple law of supply versus Demand,
combined with trader psychology. Understand what the losing traders are
doing and learn to exploit their mistakes. If the majority of the traders are
short, who is left to sell? Supply has run out. The markets must reverse,
which will cause shorts to cover and price to rally.
We are not trading the markets. We are trading other traders. Traders trade
their own belief systems. Last, patience and discipline are your best friends.
Trading is not gambling. Hold a professional mindset and not a gambler’s
mentality. Most of the trading day is spent sitting tight and waiting for oppor-
tunities. If you lack patience, trading is not right for you.

t’s one thing to day trade, but what are you going to trade? Stocks, pork
bellies, or baseball cards? You have myriad choices, but you have to
choose so that you can learn the market, know what changes to expect, and
make your trades accordingly. And, to avoid of the devilment of the wash-sale
rule, which can limit the tax deductibility of short-term losses (and which
you can read all about in Chapter 10), you’ll probably want to make your 
universe of trading assets as broad as possible.
Still, you can’t trade everything. There are only so many hours in a day and
only so many ideas you can hold in your head at any one time. Furthermore,
some trading strategies (see Chapter 7) lend themselves better to certain
types of assets than others. By learning more about all the various invest-
ment assets available to a day trader, you can make better decisions about
what you want to trade and how you want to trade it.
What Makes a Good Day Trading Asset
In academic terms, the universe of investable assets includes just about any-
thing you can buy at one price and sell at another, potentially higher price.
That means artwork and collectibles, real estate, and private companies
would all be considered to be investable assets.

Day traders have a much smaller group of assets to work with. It’s not realistic
to expect a quick one-day profit on price changes in real estate. Online auc-
tions for collectible items take place over days, not minutes. If you’re going to
day trade, you want to find assets that trade easily, several times a day, in rec-
ognized markets. In other words, you want liquidity. As an individual trading
your own account, you want assets that can be purchased with relatively low
capital commitments. And finally, you may want to use leverage — borrowed
money — to improve your return (discussed in more detail in Chapter 14), so
you want to look for assets that can be purchased using other people’s money.
Liquidity
Liquidity is the ability to buy or sell an asset in large quantity without affect-
ing the price levels. Day traders look for liquid assets so they can move in and
out of the market quickly without disrupting price levels. Otherwise, they
may not be able to buy at a good price or sell when they want.
At the most basic level, financial markets are driven by supply and demand.
The more of an asset supplied in the market, the lower the price; the more of
an asset that people demand, the higher the price. In a perfect market, the
amount of supply and demand is matched so that prices don’t change. This
happens if there is a high volume of people trading, so that their supply and
demand is constantly matched, or if there is a very low frequency of trades,
so that the price never changes.
You may be thinking, wait, don’t I want big price changes so that I can make
money quickly? Yes, you want price changes in the market, but you don’t
want to be the one causing them. The less liquid a market is, the more likely
your buying and selling is going to affect market prices, and the smaller your
profit will be.
Volume
Volume is the total amount of a security that trades in a given time period. The
greater the volume, the more buyers and sellers are interested in the security,
and the easier it is to get in there and buy and sell without affecting the price. 
Day traders also look at the relationship between volume and price. This is
an important technical indicator, discussed in more detail in Chapter 12. The
simple version is this:
 High volume with no change in price levels means that there is an equal
match between buyers and sellers. 
 High volume with rising prices means that there are more buyers than
sellers, so the price will continue going up.
 High volume with falling prices means that there are more sellers than
buyers, so the price will keep going down.
50
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals

Frequency
Another measure of liquidity is frequency, or how often a security trades.
Some assets, like stock market futures, trade constantly, from the moment
the market opens until the very last trade of the day, and then continue into
overnight trading. Others, like agricultural commodities, trade only during
market hours or only during certain times of the year. Other securities, like
stocks, trade frequently, but the volume rises and falls are regular intervals
related to such things as options expiration (the date at which options on the
stock expire).
The more frequently a security trades, the more opportunities you’ll have to
identify the short-term profit opportunities that make day trading possible.
Volatility, standard deviation, 
and variance
The volatility of a security is how much the price varies over a period of time.
It tells you how much prices fluctuate and thus how likely you are to be able
to take advantage of that. For example, if a security has an average price of 
$5 but trades anywhere between $1 and $14, it will be more volatile than one
with an average price of $5 that trades between $4 and $6.
One standard measure of volatility and risk is standard deviation, which is
how much any given price quote varies from a security’s average price. If you
are dying to see it, the math is shown in Figure 3-1, but you can calculate it
with most spreadsheet programs and many trading platforms.

51
Chapter 3: Signing Up for Asset Classes

For each of the prices, you’d calculate the difference between it and the aver-
age value. So if the average price is $5, and the closing price today is $8, the
difference would be $3. (More likely, the research service that you use would
calculate the difference for you, and you can learn more about research ser-
vices in Chapter 7.)
After you have all the differences between the prices and the average, you’d
find the square of these differences. If the difference for one day’s price is $8,
then the square would be $64. You’d add up all the squared differences over
the period of time that you are looking at and then find the average of them.
That number is called the variance, or σ2. Finally, calculate the square root of
the variance, and you have the standard deviation.
The higher the standard deviation, the higher the volatility, the higher the
volatility, the more a security’s price is going to fluctuate, and the more profit —
and loss — opportunities there are for a day trader.
Standard deviation is also a measure of risk that can be used to evaluate your
trading performance. That use of the measure is discussed in Chapter 11.
Capital requirements
You don’t necessarily need a lot of money to begin day trading, but you do
need a lot of money to buy certain securities. Stocks generally trade in round
lots, which are orders of at least 100 shares. If you want to buy a stock worth
$40 per share, you need $4,000 in your account. Your broker will probably let
you borrow half of that money, but you still need to come up with the other
$2,000.
Options and futures trade by contract, and one contract represents some
unit of the underlying security. For example, in the options market, one con-
tract is good for 100 shares of the stock. These contracts also trade in round
lots of 100 contracts per order.
No one will stop you from buying a smaller amount than the usual round lot
in any given security, but you’ll probably pay a high commission and get
worse execution for your order. Because the returns on each trade tend to 
be small anyway, don’t take up day trading until you have enough money to
trade your target asset effectively. Otherwise, you’ll pay too much to your
broker without getting much for yourself.
Bonds do not trade in fractional amounts; they trade on a per-bond basis,
and each bond has a face value of $1,000. Some trade for more or less than
that, depending on how the bond’s interest rate differs from the market rate
of interest, but the $1,000 is a good number to keep in mind when thinking
about capital requirements. Many dealers have a minimum order of 10 bonds,
though, so a minimum order would be $10,000. 
52
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals

Marginability
Most day traders make money through a large volume of small profits. One
way to increase the profit per trade is to use borrowed money in order to 
buy more shares, more contracts, or more bonds. Margin is money in your
account that you borrow against, and almost all brokers will be happy to
arrange a margin loan for you, especially if you’re going to use the money to
make more trades and generate more commissions for the brokerage firm. In
Chapter 14, I discuss how margin is used within an investment strategy. Here,
though, you want to think about how margin affects your choice of assets for
day trading.
Generally, a stock or bond account must hold 50 percent of the purchase
price of securities when you borrow the money. So if you want to buy $100
worth of something on margin, you need to have $50 in your account. The
price of those securities can go down, but if they go down so much that the
account now holds only 25 percent of the value of the loan, you’ll get a
margin call.
Margin requirements aren’t set by the brokerage firms. Instead, the minimum
amount in your account — and thus the maximum amount you can borrow —
is set by the Federal Reserve Board. That’s because of concerns that if too
much borrowing takes place, the borrowers will panic in a financial downturn
and drag the market down even further. (Excessive trading on margin was a
contributing factor to the stock market crash of 1929, in which the Dow Jones
Industrial Average fell 13 percent in one day, and the market did not fully
recover until 1954.) The Fed limits the amount that can be borrowed, and the
different exchanges monitor how member brokerage firms comply. Some bro-
kerage firms set margin limits that are higher than those of the Federal
Reserve Board and the exchanges.
You probably think that the 1929 crash was responsible for the Great
Depression of the 1930s, right? Think again. Most economic historians believe
that the crash was a distraction. Instead, the real problem was that interest
rates fell so rapidly that banks refused to lend money, while prices fell so low
that companies had no incentive to produce. It’s a situation known as defla-
tion, and it’s relatively rare, but it is devastating when it occurs.
Most stocks and bonds are marginable (able to be purchased on margin), and
the Federal Reserve Board allows traders to borrow up to 50 percent of their
value. But not all securities are marginable. Stocks priced below $5 per share,
those traded on the OTC Bulletin Board or Pink Sheets (discussed later in
this chapter), and those in newly public companies often cannot be bor-
rowed against or purchased on margin. Your brokerage firm should have a
list of securities that are not eligible for margin.
53
Chapter 3: Signing Up for Asset Classes

If leverage is going to be part of your day-trading strategy, be sure that the
assets you plan to trade are marginable.
Securities and How They Trade
In the financial markets, people buy and sell securities every day, but just
what are they buying or selling? Securities are financial instruments. In the
olden days, they were pieces of paper, but now they are electronic entries
that represent a legal claim on some type of underlying asset. This asset may
be a business, if the security is a stock, or it may be a loan to a government
or a corporation, if the security is a bond. In this section, I cover different
types of securities that day traders are likely to run across and tell you what
you need to jump into the fray.
In practice, asset and security are synonyms, and derivative is considered to
be a type of asset or security. But to be precise, these three are not the same:
 An asset is a physical item. Examples include a company, a house, gold
bullion, or a loan.
 A security is a contract that gives someone the right of ownership of the
asset, such as a share of stock, a bond, a promissory note.
 A derivative is a contract that draws its value from the price of a security.
Stocks
A stock, also called an equity, is a security that represents a fractional interest
in the ownership of a company. Buy one share of Microsoft, and you are an
owner of the company, just as Bill Gates is. He may own a much larger share
of the total business, but you both have a stake in it. Stockholders elect a
board of directors to represent their interests in how the company is man-
aged. Each share is a vote, so good luck getting Bill Gates kicked off of
Microsoft’s board.
A share of stock has limited liability. That means that you can lose all of 
your investment, but no more than that. If the company files for bankruptcy,
the creditors cannot come after the shareholders for the money that they 
are owed. 
Some companies pay their shareholders a dividend, which is a small cash
payment made out of firm profits. Because day traders hold stock for really
short periods of time, they don’t normally collect dividends.
54
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals

How U.S. stocks trade
Stocks are priced based on a single share, and most brokerage firms charge
commissions on a per-share basis. Despite this per-share pricing, stocks are
almost always traded in round lots of 100 shares. The supply and demand for
a given stock is driven by the company’s expected performance.
A stock’s price is quoted with a bid and an ask.
 The bid is the price that the broker will buy the stock from you if you are
selling.
 The ask is the price that the broker will charge you if you are the one
buying.
I remember the difference between the bid and the ask this way: the broker
buys on the bid. Let alliteration be your friend!
The difference between the bid and the ask is the spread, and that represents
the dealer’s profit. 
Here is an example of a price quote:
MSFT $27.70 $27.71
That is a quote for Microsoft (ticker symbol: MSFT). The bid is listed first:
$27.70; and the ask is $27.71. That’s the smallest spread you’ll ever see! The
spread here is so small because Microsoft is a liquid stock, and there are no
big news events going on that might change the balance of buyers and sellers.
The brokerage firm makes money from the commission and from the spread.
Many novice day traders focus on the amount of the commission and forget
that some brokerage firms can execute the order better than others, thus
keeping the spread narrower. You need to consider the total cost of trading
when you design a trading strategy and choose a brokerage firm. 
I tend to use the words broker and dealer interchangeably, but there is a dif-
ference. A broker simply matches buyers and sellers of securities, whereas a
dealer buys and sells securities out of its own account. Almost all brokerage
firms are both brokers and dealers. 
Where U.S. stocks trade
U.S. stocks trade mostly on organized exchanges such as the New York Stock
Exchange and NASDAQ, but more and more they trade on electronic commu-
nications networks, some of which are operated by the exchanges them-
selves. Brokerage firms either belong to the exchanges themselves or work
with a correspondent firm that handles the trading for them, turning over the
order in exchange for a cut of the commission. 
55
Chapter 3: Signing Up for Asset Classes

When you place an order with your brokerage firm, the broker’s trading staff
executes that order wherever it can get the best deal. But is that the best deal
for you, or for the brokerage firm? It’s tough to know the right answer. In gen-
eral, firms that do more trading and participate in several exchanges and
electronic communications networks can get you the best execution. (To
learn more about choosing brokerage firms, turn to Chapter 6.)
The financial markets are in a state of flux, with a lot of mergers and acquisi-
tions among the exchanges. The information here might be obsolete when
you read it, which I think is fascinating. It wasn’t so long ago that these
exchanges were staid organizations run like private clubs.
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
The New York Stock Exchange is the Big Kahuna of stock exchanges. Most of
the largest U.S. corporations trade on it, and they pay a fee for that privilege.
The 2,000 or so companies listed on the exchange are known by their ticker
symbols, shorthand for the company name. On the New York Stock Exchange,
all ticker symbols have three letters or fewer, and many old companies have
one-letter symbols, like F for Ford and T for AT&T.
Two of the largest companies in the world, Intel and Microsoft, are not listed
on the New York Stock Exchange, and supposedly, exchange officials have
told both companies that if they move to the NYSE, they can have the ticker
symbols I and M, which were unassigned for decades. In 2007, the NYSE gave
the M symbol to Macy’s, formerly Federated Stores, but as this book was
going to press, Macy’s was rumored to be acquired by a private equity firm,
so M may be available once again to tantalize Mr. Gates and company. 
In order to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, a company generally
needs to have at least 2,200 shareholders, trade at least 100,000 shares a
month, carry a market capitalization (number of shares outstanding multi-
plied by price per share) of at least $100 million, and post annual revenues 
of at least $75 million. 
The New York Stock Exchange is more than 200 years old, but it has been
going through some big corporate changes in order to stay relevant. It’s a
floor-based exchange. The trading area is a big open space in the building,
known as the floor. The floor broker, who works for the member firm,
receives the order electronically and then takes it over to the trading post,
which is the area on the floor where the stock in question trades. At the 
trading post, the floor broker executes the order at the best available price. 
56
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals

The American Stock Exchange (AMEX)
The American Stock Exchange is a floor-based exchange also headquartered
in New York City. Like the New York Stock Exchange, floor brokers receive
orders and take them to trading posts to be filled. AMEX specializes in com-
modity companies — those that mine metals or pump out oil — but there are
some other types of businesses listed on it. Listed companies have two- or
three-letter ticker symbols and generally are profitable, have a market capi-
talization (number of shares outstanding multiplied by price per share) of at
least $75 million, and have a price per share of at least $2.00. These compa-
nies tend to be smaller and more speculative than New York Stock Exchange
companies.
NASDAQ
NASDAQ used to stand for the National Association of Securities Dealers
Automated Quotation System, but now it’s just a name, not an acronym, 
pronounced just like it’s spelled. When NASDAQ was founded, it was an 
electronic communication network (more on those below) that handled 
companies that were too small or too speculative to meet New York Stock
Exchange or American Stock Exchange listing requirements. What happened
was that brokers liked using the NASDAQ network, while technology compa-
nies (Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, Apple) that were once small and speculative
became huge international behemoths. But the management teams of these
companies saw no reason to change how they were listed. 
57
Chapter 3: Signing Up for Asset Classes
Bringing the NYSE into the 21st century
I’ve been on the floor of the New York Stock
Exchange, and it’s exciting, watching all these
people in colorful cotton jackets running from
post to post, talking in their cell phones the
entire time. It’s not necessarily the most efficient
way to execute orders in the modern era,
though. That’s why in early 2006, the New York
Stock Exchange merged with Archipelago, an
electronic communications network (discussed
in more detail later in this section), and now
offers both electronic and exchange trading.
Because Archipelago was already publicly
traded, the New York Stock Exchange itself
became a publicly traded company when the
deal closed (NYSE: NYX).
Archipelago had owned the Pacific Stock
Exchange, which was shut down after the
merger. The NYSE then announced a merger
with Euronext, which operates exchanges in
Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris, London, and
Lisbon; a 5-percent investment in India’s
National Stock Exchange; and a strategic part-
nership with the Tokyo Stock Exchange to
develop new products and trading systems.
These transactions may make it easier for day
traders to do business in international securi-
ties and should improve execution, thus making
it easier to get a profit.

NASDAQ companies have four-letter ticker symbols. When a customer places
an order, the brokerage firm looks to see whether there is a matching order
on the network. Sometimes, it can be executed electronically; in other cases,
the brokerage firm’s trader needs to call other traders at other firms to see
whether the price is still good. A key feature of NASDAQ is its market makers,
who are employees of member brokerage firms who agree to buy and sell
minimum levels of specific stocks in order to ensure that there is some basic
level of trading taking place.
NASDAQ divides its listed companies into three categories:
 The NASDAQ Global Select Market includes the 1,000 largest compa-
nies on the exchange and has high governance and liquidity standards
for participating firms.
 The NASDAQ Global Market includes companies that are too small for
the Global Select Market, but that in general have a market capitalization
of at least $75 million, at least 1.1 million shares outstanding, at least 400
shareholders, and a minimum price per share of $5.00.
 The NASDAQ Capital Market is for companies that do not qualify for
the NASDAQ Global Market. To qualify here, companies need a market
capitalization of at least $50 million, at least one million shares outstand-
ing, about 300 shareholders, and a minimum price per share of $4.00.
Day traders will find that NASDAQ Global Select Market companies are the
most liquid. They may also notice changes in trading patterns when a com-
pany is close to being moved between categories. An upgrade is a sign of
good news to come and increased market interest. A downgrade means 
that the company most likely isn’t doing well and will be of less interest to
investors.
Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTC BB)
The Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board is the market for companies that are
reporting their financials to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
but that do not qualify for listing in any NASDAQ category. It also includes
some foreign issuers that have not received listing in a U.S. market. American
Bulletin Board companies have four-letter ticker symbols followed by .OB.
For example, Vertical Communication’s ticker symbol is VRCC.OB. Foreign
issuers trade with five-letter symbols — four letters followed by an F. ACS
Motion Control, based in Israel, trades as ACSEF. 
Brokerage firms get quotations on OTC BB stocks through their NASDAQ
workstation or other quotation services, so that they can find current prices
and locate buyers and sellers for any orders that they have.
58
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals

In many cases, OTC BB companies are those that used to be on NASDAQ but
that have lost too much money to maintain their listing. A Bulletin Board list-
ing is often a last hurrah before oblivion.
Pink Sheets
Once upon a time, there were few electronic networks, and there was not
room for many companies to trade on them. Smaller companies did not trade
daily. To find current prices, brokerage firms subscribed to a price service
that sent out a weekly newsletter listing the prices for those companies. The
newsletter was printed on pink paper, so it became known as the Pink Sheets.
Over the years, NASDAQ expanded and added more listing opportunities for
companies, and the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board was created for compa-
nies that had to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission but that
did not qualify for NASDAQ. The universe of companies that did not qualify
for one of these quotation systems was very small. The Pink Sheets went
online (www.pinksheets.com) so that people could get more regular price
information. 
Pink Sheet companies do not have listing requirements. Most do not qualify
for listing on the NASDAQ or OTC BB, usually because they are not current
on their filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These compa-
nies have four- or five-letter ticker symbols and are sometimes shown with
the suffix .PK after the ticker. Orders for Pink Sheet companies are placed
through brokerage firms who use the service to find prices and match buyers
and sellers.
Not all Pink Sheet companies are legitimate. Because of the minimal listing
requirements, the Pink Sheets tend to be the hangout for the penny stock
(those trading at less than $1.00 per share), the fraudulent company, and the
security that’s easily manipulated by a boiler-room operator. It can be a
tough crowd, and a lot of people get burned.
Electronic Communication Networks (ECN)
In addition to all the exchanges and listing categories, companies titanic 
and tiny also trade on various electronic communication networks, or ECNs.
Brokerage firms and such large institutional investors as mutual fund compa-
nies subscribe to them in order to trade securities without having to pay
exchange fees or commissions. ECNs are also used to trade when the market
is closed. Subscribers look to see whether the ECN has a match for their
orders; if so, the orders are executed automatically.
Electronic communication networks can be huge. NASDAQ, for example, is
used by almost every brokerage firm in the United States, and the New York
Stock Exchange acquired Archipelago, an ECN now known as NYSE Arca.
Other ECNs are smaller and may combine only a few brokerage firms. In 
most cases, day traders can’t access these networks directly, but instead 
will access them through their brokerage firms.

Bonds
A bond is a loan. The bond buyer gives the bond issuer money. The bond
issuer promises to pay interest on a regular basis. The regular coupon pay-
ments are why bonds are often called fixed income investments. Bond issuers
repay the money borrowed — the principal — on a predetermined date,
known as the maturity. Bonds generally have a maturity of more than ten
years; shorter-term bonds are usually referred to as notes, and bonds that
will mature within a year of issuance are usually referred to as bills. Most
bonds in the United States are issued by corporations (corporate bonds) or
by the Federal government (Treasury bonds). Some are issued by local gov-
ernments (municipal bonds).
The interest payments on a bond are called coupons. If you look on a bulletin
board in a coffee shop or other community space, you’ll probably see a “car
for sale” or “apartment for rent” sign with little slips of paper carrying a
phone number or email address cut into the bottom. If you are interested,
you can rip off the slip and contact the advertiser later. Bonds used to look
the same. The bond buyer would receive one large certificate good for the
principal, with a lot of smaller certificates, called coupons, attached. When a
payment was due, the owner would cut off the matching coupon and deposit
it in the bank. (Some old novels refer to rich people as “coupon clippers,”
meaning that their sole labor in life was to cut out their bond coupons and
cash them in. Nowadays, bond payments are handled electronically, so the
modern coupon clipper is a bargain hunter looking for an extra 50 cents off a
jar of peanut butter.) 
Over the years, enterprising financiers realized that some investors needed
regular payments, but others wanted to receive a single sum at a future date.
So they separated the coupons from the principal. The principal payment,
known as a zero-coupon bond, is sold to one investor, while the coupons,
called strips, are sold to another investor. The borrower makes the payments
just like with a regular bond. (Regular bonds, by the way, are sometimes
called plain vanilla.) 
The borrower who wants to make a series of payments with no lump-sum
principal repayment would issue an amortizing bond to return principal and
interest on a regular basis. If you think about a typical mortgage, the bor-
rower makes a regular payment of both principal and interest. This way, the
amount owed gets smaller over time so that the borrower does not have to
come up with a large principal repayment at maturity.
Other borrowers would prefer to make a single payment at maturity, so they
issue discount bonds. The purchase price is the principal reduced by the
amount of interest that otherwise would be paid. 
60
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals

If a company goes bankrupt, the bondholders get paid before the sharehold-
ers. In some bankruptcies, the bondholders take over the business, leaving
the current shareholders with nothing. 
How bonds trade
Bonds often trade as single bonds, with a face value of $1000, although some
brokers will only take on minimum orders of ten bonds. They do not trade as
frequently as stocks do because most bond investors are looking for steady
income, so they hold their bonds until maturity. Bonds have less risk than
stocks, so they show less price volatility. The value of a bond is mostly deter-
mined by the level of interest rates in the economy. As rates go up, bond
prices go down; when rates go down, bond prices go up. Bond prices are also
affected by how likely the loan is to be repaid. If traders don’t think that the
bond issuer will pay up, then the bond price will fall. 
Generally speaking, only corporate and municipal bonds have repayment
risk. It’s possible that the U.S. government could default, but that’s unlikely
as long as it can print money. Most international government bonds have sim-
ilarly low default risk, but some countries have defaulted. The most notable
was Russia, which refused to print money to repay its debts in the summer of
1998. This caused huge turmoil in the world’s financial markets, including the
collapse of a major hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management. 
Investment banks and the Federal government sell new bonds directly to
investors. After they are issued, bonds are said to trade in the secondary
market — some are listed, some trade over-the-counter, meaning dealers
trade them amongst themselves rather than over an organized exchange.
A bond price quote looks like this:
3 3/4 Mar 07 n
99:28 99:29
This is a U.S. Treasury note maturing in March 2007 carrying an interest rate
of 3.75 per cent. Similar to stocks, the numbers right after the “n” (for note)
list the bid and ask. The first number is the bid, and it’s the price that the
dealer will buy the bond from you if you are selling. The second number is
the ask, and it is the price that the dealer will charge you if you are buying.
The difference is the spread, and that’s the dealer’s profit.
But wait, there’s more: corporate bonds trade in eighths of a percentage
point, and Treasury bonds trade in 32nds. The bid of 99:28 means that the
bond’s bid price is 99 28/32 per cent of the face value of $1000, or $998.75.
61
Chapter 3: Signing Up for Asset Classes

Why on earth do bonds trade in eighths or fractions of eighths? Do traders
just like to show off their math skills? No, it goes back to before the American
Revolution. The dominant currency in most of Americas then was the Spanish
doubloon, a large gold coin that could be cut into fractions to make trade
easier. Like a pie, it would be cut into eight equal pieces, so prices throughout
the colonies were often set in eighths. (In Robert Louis Stevenson’s book
Treasure Island, the parrot keeps squawking “Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!”
This is why.)
The fractional pricing convention carried over to American securities mar-
kets, and it’s persisted because it guarantees dealers a bigger spread than
pricing in decimals. After all, 1/32 of a dollar is more than 1/100. U.S. stocks
were priced in sixteenths until 2001, and bond markets still maintain the old
convention. 
Most bonds are not suitable for day traders. Only Treasury bonds, issued by
the U.S. government, have enough consistent trading volume to attract a day
trader. Because of the capital required to trade and the relatively low liquid-
ity of many types of bonds, many traders prefer to use futures to bet on inter-
est rates. I discuss futures in detail later in this chapter.
Are you one of those day traders who wants to buy or sell bonds anyway? 
Or do you just want to know more about the market? Then read on.
Listed bonds
Some larger corporate bonds are traded on the New York Stock Exchange and
the American Stock Exchange. Those wanting to buy or sell them place an
order through their brokerage firm, which sends an order to the floor broker.
The process is almost identical to the trading of listed stocks.
Over-the-counter trading
Most corporate and municipal bonds trade over-the-counter, meaning there
is no organized exchange. Instead, brokerage firms use electronic price ser-
vices to find out where the buyers and sellers are for different issues. Over-
the-counter bonds don’t trade much. Buyers often give their quality, interest
rate, and maturity requirements to their broker, and the broker waits until a
suitable bond comes to market.
Treasury dealers
Unlike the corporate and municipal bond market, the Treasury market is one
of the most liquid in the world. The best way to buy a new Treasury bond is
directly from the government, because there is no commission involved. You
can get more information from the Treasury Department’s Web site,
62
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals

www.savingsbonds.gov; despite the name, it has information on all kinds
of government bonds for all kinds of purchasers.
After the bonds are issued, they trade on a secondary market of Treasury
dealers. These are large brokerage firms registered with the government who
agree to buy and sell bonds and maintain a stable market for the bonds If
your brokerage firm is not a Treasury dealer, it has a relationship with one
that it can send your order to.
Treasury dealers do quite a bit of day trading in Treasury bonds for the firm’s
own account. After all, the market is liquid enough that day trading is possi-
ble. Few individual day traders work the Treasury market, though, because it
requires a great deal of capital and leverage to make a high return.
Exchange traded funds (ETFs)
Exchange traded funds are a cross between mutual funds and stocks, and they
offer a great way for day traders to get exposure to market segments that
might otherwise be difficult to trade. A money management firm buys a group
of assets — stocks, bonds, or others — and then lists shares that trade on
the market. (One of the largest organizers of exchange traded funds is
iShares, www.ishares.com) In most cases, the purchased assets are
designed to mimic the performance of an index, and investors know what
those assets are before they purchase shares in the fund. 
Exchange traded funds are available on the big market indexes, like the
Standard & Poor’s 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. They are avail-
able in a variety of domestic bond indexes, international stock indexes, for-
eign currencies, and commodities. 
How U.S. exchange traded funds trade
For day traders, the advantage of exchange traded funds is that they can be
bought and sold just like stocks, discussed earlier in this chapter. Customers
place orders, usually in round lots, through their brokerage firms. The price
quotes come in decimals and include a spread for the dealer.
Where U.S. exchange traded funds trade
The firm that sets up the exchange traded fund gets to choose the market
where it will trade, as long as the fund meets the exchange’s requirements for
size, liquidity, and financial reporting. Exchange traded funds trade on the
NYSE, the AMEX, and NASDAQ.

Cash and Currency
Cash is king, as they say. It’s money that’s readily available in your day trad-
ing account to buy more securities. For the most part, the interest rate on
cash is very low, but if you are closing out your positions every night, you’ll
always have a cash balance in your brokerage account. The firm will proba-
bly pay you a little interest on it, so it will contribute to your total return.
Money market accounts are boring. For day trading excitement, cash can be
traded as foreign currency. Every day, trillions (yes, that’s trillions with a t) 
of dollars are exchanged, creating opportunities to make money as the
exchange rates change. Currency is a bigger, more liquid market than the U.S.
stock and bond markets combined. It’s often referred to as the forex market,
short for foreign exchange.
How currency trades
The exchange rate is the price of money. It tells you how many dollars it
takes to buy yen, pounds, or euros. The price that people are willing to pay
for a currency depends on the investment opportunities, business opportuni-
ties, and perceived safety in each nation. If American businesses see great
opportunities in Thailand, for example, they’ll have to trade their dollars for
baht in order to pay rent, buy supplies, and hire workers there. This will
increase the demand for baht relative to the dollar, and it will cause the baht
to go up in price relative to the dollar.
Exchange rates are quoted on a bid-ask basis, just as are bonds and stocks. A
quote might look like this:
USDJPY=X 118.47 118.50
This is the exchange rate for converting the U.S. dollar into Japanese yen.
The bid price of 118.47 is the amount of yen that a dealer would give you if
you wanted to sell a dollar and buy yen. The ask price of 118.50 is the amount
of yen the dealer would charge you if you wanted to buy a dollar and sell yen.
The difference is the dealer’s profit, and naturally, you’ll be charged a com-
mission, too.
Note that with currency, you’re a buyer and a seller at the same time. This
can increase the profit opportunities, but it can also increase your risk. 
Day traders can trade currencies directly at current exchange rates, which 
is known as trading in the spot market. They can also use currency exchange
traded funds (discussed earlier) or currency futures (discussed later in this
chapter) to profit from the changing prices of money. 
64
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals

Where currency trades
Spot currency — the real-time value of money — does not trade on an orga-
nized exchange. Instead, banks, brokerage firms, hedge funds, and currency
dealers buy and sell amongst themselves all day, every day.
Day traders can open dedicated forex accounts through their broker or a 
currency dealer (one is GTForex, www.gtforex.com) and then trade as they
see opportunities during the day.
Commodities and How They Trade
Commodities are basic, interchangeable goods sold in bulk and used to make
other goods. Examples include oil, gold, wheat, and lumber. Commodities are
popular with investors as a hedge against inflation and uncertainty. Stock
prices can go to zero, but people still need to eat! While commodity prices
usually tend to increase at the same rate as in the overall economy, so they
maintain their real (inflation-adjusted) value, they can also be susceptible to
short-term changes in supply and demand. A cold winter increases demand
for oil, a dry summer reduces production of wheat, and a civil war could dis-
rupt access to platinum mines.
Day traders aren’t going to buy commodities outright - if you really want to
haul bushels of grain around all day, you can do that without taking on the
risks of day trading. You’d get more exercise, too. Instead, day traders who
want to play with commodities can look to other investments. The most pop-
ular way is to buy futures contracts, which change in price with the underly-
ing commodity (discussed later in this chapter). Increasingly, many trade
commodities through exchange traded funds (see earlier section) that are
based on the value of an underlying basket of commodities.
Derivatives and How They Trade
Derivatives are financial contracts that draw their value from the value of an
underlying asset, security, or index. For example, an S&P 500 futures contract
would give the buyer a cash payment based on the price of the S&P 500 index
on the day that the contract expires. The contract’s value thus depends on
where the index is trading. You are not trading the index itself, but rather you
are trading a contract with a value derived from the price of the index. The
index value changes all the time, so day traders have lots of opportunities to
buy and sell.
65
Chapter 3: Signing Up for Asset Classes

Types of derivatives
Day traders are likely to come across three types of derivatives. Options and
futures trade on dedicated derivatives exchanges, whereas warrants trade on
stock exchanges.
Options
An option is a contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation,
to buy or sell the underlying asset at an agreed-upon price at an agreed-upon
date in the future. An option that gives you the right to buy is a call, and one
that gives you the right to sell is a put. A call is most valuable if the stock
price is going up, whereas a put has more value if the stock price is going
down.
Here’s one way to remember the difference: you call up your friend to put
down your enemy.
For example, a MSFT 2007 Mar 22.50 call gives you the right to buy Microsoft
at $22.50 per share at the expiration date on the third Friday in March, 2007.
(Did you know that traders refer to Microsoft as “Mr. Softy”? Clever, huh?) If
Microsoft is trading above $22.50, you can exercise the option and make a
quick profit. If it is selling below $22.50, you could by the stock cheaper in the
open market, so the option would be worthless.
You can find great information on options, including online tutorials, at the
Chicago Board Options Exchange Web site, www.cboe.com.
Futures
A futures contract gives one the obligation to buy a set quantity of the under-
lying asset at set price and a set future date. These started in the agricultural
industry because they allowed farmers and food processors to lock in their
prices early in the growing season, reducing the amount of uncertainty in
their businesses. Futures have now been applied to many different assets,
ranging from pork bellies (which really do trade — they are used to make
bacon) to currency values. A simple example is a lock in a home mortgage
rate; the borrower knows the rate that will be applied before the sale is
closed and the loan is finalized. Day traders use futures to trade commodities
without having to handle the actual assets. 
Most futures contracts are closed out with cash before the settlement date.
Financial contracts — futures on currencies, interest rates, or market index
values — can only be closed out with cash. Commodity contracts may be 
settled with the physical items, but almost all are settled with cash. No one
hauls a side of beef onto the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade!
66
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals

Warrants
A warrant is similar to an option, but it’s issued by the company rather than
sold on an organized exchange. (After they are issued, warrants trade simi-
larly to stocks.) A warrant gives the holder the right to buy more stock in the
company at an agreed-upon price in the future. 
A cousin of the warrant is the convertible bond, which is debt issued by the
company. The company pays interest on the bond, and the bondholder has
the right to exchange it for stock, depending on where interest rates and the
stock price are. Convertibles trade on the stock exchanges.
Buying and selling derivatives
Derivatives trade a little differently than other types of securities because
they are based on promises. When someone buys an option on a stock, they
aren’t trading the stock with someone right now, they are buying the right to
buy or sell it in the future. That means that the option buyer needs to know
that the person on the other side is going to pay up. Because of that, the
derivatives exchanges have systems in place to make sure that those who
buy and sell the contracts will be able to perform when they have to.
Requirements for trading derivatives are different than in other markets.
How derivatives trade
Remember marginability from early in this chapter? Well, the word margin is
used differently when discussing derivatives, but that’s in part because deriv-
atives are already leveraged — you aren’t buying the asset, just exposure to
the price change, so you can get a lot of bang for your buck. (The risks and
rewards of leverage are covered in detail in Chapter 14.) 
Margin in the derivatives market is the money you have to put up to ensure
that you’ll perform on the contract when it comes time to execute it. In the
stock market, margin is collateral against a loan from the brokerage firm. In
the derivatives markets, margin is collateral against the amount you might
have to pay up on the contract. The more likely it is that you will have to pay
the party who bought or sold the contract, the more margin money you will
have to put up. Some exchanges use the term performance bond instead.
To buy a derivative, you put up the margin with the exchange’s clearing
house. That way, the exchange knows that you have the money to make good
on your side of the deal — if, say, a call option that you sell is executed, or
you lose money on a currency forward that you buy. Your brokerage firm will
arrange for the deposit. 
67
Chapter 3: Signing Up for Asset Classes

At the end of each day, derivatives contracts are marked-to-market, meaning
that they are revalued. Profits are credited to the trader’s margin account,
and losses are deducted. If the margin falls below the necessary amount, the
trader will get a call and have to deposit more money. 
By definition, day traders close out at the end of every day, so their options
are not marked-to-market. The contracts will be someone else’s problem, and
the profits or losses on the trade go straight to the margin account, ready for
the next day’s trading.
Where derivatives trade
Traditionally, derivative trading involves open-outcry on physical exchanges.
Traders on the floor get orders and execute them amongst themselves,
shouting and using hand signals to indicate what they want to do. There is no
central trading post or market maker to control the activities or guarantee a
market. Most traders are employees of large commodities brokerage firms,
but some are independent. No matter who employs them, traders may be
executing someone else’s orders for a fee, or they may be working for propri-
etary accounts.
Open-outcry has fewer economies of scale than the electronic trading sys-
tems that dominate activity in other assets. That’s why there are more deriva-
tives exchanges in the United States than active stock exchanges. Still, all the
exchanges offer some electronic trading services, and that has become more
and more popular. It’s also causing much restructuring and consolidation
among the exchanges. As I write this, the Chicago Board of Trade is planning
a merger with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange; floor traders at both
exchanges have been steadily losing market share to electronic trading.
Sometimes, the people in the pits start messing around with each other, and
that can cause unusual volatility in the trading of the securities. Day traders
who deal in commodities will often notice short periods of irrational trading
for those derivatives that trade primarily in pits. The more human involve-
ment there is, the less efficient a market will be. 
Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)
The Chicago Board Options Exchange, often known by the acronym CBOE
(pronounced see-bow), is the largest options market in the United States. This
is where orders for stock options are traded. Brokerage firms use floor bro-
kers in the trading pits or the CBOE’s electronic trading system to handle
customer orders.
68
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals

Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT)
At the top of the Chicago Board of Trade’s building is a statue of Ceres, the
Greek goddess of grain. That’s because this is the center of futures trading 
in corn, wheat, rice, oats, and soybeans. The Board of Trade has branched
out over the years and now offers futures contracts on financial commodities
like Treasury bonds and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Recently, it added
trading in ethanol futures, an expansion from its history with corn. When a
brokerage firm gets a customer order for a future traded on the Board of
Trade, it can send it to floor brokers to fill in the trading pits, or it can use 
the exchange’s electronic trading system.
Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)
Futures in non-grain agricultural products, such as milk, butter, cattle, pork
bellies, and fertilizer, trade at The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, known 
more colloquially as the Merc. Other key futures traded here include foreign
exchange, interest rates, and Standard and Poor’s and NASDAQ indexes. The
Merc has also added some alternative products such as futures in weather
and real estate. When brokerage firms receive orders for the Merc’s futures,
they send it to floor brokers, who can fill it in the trading pits, or they can use
the Merc’s electronic trading system.
New York Board of Trade (NYBOT)
The New York Board of Trade was founded in 1998, when the Coffee, Sugar,
and Cocoa Exchange merged with the New York Cotton Exchange. Here,
traders can buy and sell futures and options on those commodities as well as
on orange juice, the New York Stock Exchange, the U.S. dollar, and the euro.
Orders are filled in the trading pits or through an electronic trading system. 
New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX)
Fuels and metals trade at the New York Mercantile Exchange, which is the
largest physical commodities exchange in the United States. Most trading
takes place in open-outcry pits, but an electronic system is available for
overnight trading.

 Investing for the long haul
 Trading for the day
 Gambling it all away
 Managing the risks you take
D
ay trading isn’t investing, nor is it gambling — at least not if done right.
But the lines between the three can be thin, and if you know where they
are, you’ll be in a better position to follow your trading strategy and make
more money. And if you can avoid the trap of gambling, you’ll be better able
to preserve your trading capital.
The difference between investing and gambling is the risk and return tradeoff.
In investing, the odds are generally in your favor, but that doesn’t mean
you’re going to make money. Some day traders end up gambling, and then 
the odds are moving against them. And unlike in the finer establishments in
Las Vegas, no one is going to bring the failed day trader free drinks to help
ease the pain. A lot comes down to personality; if you are on a casino’s “do
not admit” list, you probably aren’t a great candidate for day trading.
This chapter starts off with a lot of gory details about risk and return. It 
helps you understand how the securities markets price risk and reward those
who willing to take it. Then I explain the differences in risk and reward for
investors, traders, and gamblers to give you better information to help you
plan your day trading.

Understanding Risk and Return
Investors, traders, and gamblers have this in common: They are putting some
of their money at risk and they expect to get a return. Ideally, that return
comes in the form of cold, hard cash — but at a casino, you might get your
return in the form of tickets to a Celine Dion concert after you lose a lot of
money at the tables.
Trading is a business: The more you know about the potential risks and the
sources of your potential return, the better off you’ll be. Your risk is that you
won’t get the return you expect, and your reward is that you get fair compen-
sation for the risk you take. 
What is risk, anyway?
Risk is the measurable likelihood of loss. The riskier something is, the more
frequently a loss will occur, and the larger that loss is likely to be. Playing in
traffic is riskier than driving in traffic, and skydiving is riskier than gardening.
This doesn’t mean that you can’t have losses in a low-risk activity or big
gains in a high-risk one. It just means that with the low-risk game, losses are
less likely to happen, and those that do are likely to be small.
What’s the difference between risk and uncertainty? Risk involves the known
likelihood of something good or bad happening so that it can be priced.
What’s the likelihood of your living to be 100? Or of getting into a car acci-
dent tonight? Your insurance company knows, and it figures your rates
accordingly. What’s the likelihood of aliens from outer space arriving and
taking over the Earth? Who knows! It could happen, but that event is uncer-
tain, not risky — at least until it happens. 
The ability to measure risk made modern business possible. Until mathemati-
cians were able to use statistics to quantify human activities, people assumed
that bad things were simply the result of bad luck or, worse, the wrath of the
gods. But when they could understand probability, it could be applied and
used. If a sailor agreed to join a voyage of exploration, what was the probabil-
ity that he would return home alive? And what would be fair compensation 
to him for that risk? What was the probability of a silo of grain going up in
flames? And how much should the farmer charge the grain buyers for the risk
that he was taking, and how much should someone else charge to insure the
farmer against that fire?
Considering the probability of a loss
Whenever you take risk, you take on the probability of loss. If you know 
what that probability is, you can determine whether the terms you are being
offered are fair and you have a reasonable expectation for the size of the loss. 
72
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

One way to determine whether the terms of your day trading strategy are fair
is through backtesting, which is discussed in Chapter 11.
Let’s say that you are presented with this opportunity: You put up $10. You
have an 80-percent chance of getting back $11 and a 20-percent chance of
losing everything. Should you take it? To find out, you multiply the expected
return by the likelihood and add them together: (80% × $11) + (20% × $0) =
$8.80. Your expected return of $8.80 is less than the $10 cost of this contract,
so you should pass on it.
Now, suppose you are offered this opportunity: You put up $10. You have a
90-percent chance of getting back $11 and a 10-percent chance of getting back
$6. Your expected return is (90% × $11) + (10% × $6) = $10.50. This contract
would be in your favor, so you should take it.
Now here’s a third proposition: You put up $10. You have a 90-percent chance
of getting back $13.89 and a 10-percent chance of losing $20 — even more
than you put up. Your expected return is (90% × 13.89) + (10% × –$20) =
$10.50. It’s the same expected return as the proposition above, but do you
like it as much?
When thinking about loss, most people tend to put too much weight on the
absolute dollar amount that they can lose, rather than thinking about the
likelihood. The problem is that the markets don’t trade on your personal
preferences. This is one of the psychological hurdles of trading that those
who are successful can overcome. Can you? (You can find some tips on this
in Chapter 8.)
Working with limited liability (usually)
Securities markets rely on the concept of limited liability. That is, you cannot
lose any more money than you invested in the first place. If you buy a stock,
it can go down to zero, but it can’t go any lower. If the company goes bank-
rupt, no one can come to you and ask you to cover the bills. On the other
hand, the most the stock can go up in price is infinity, so the possible return
for your risk is huge. (Microsoft has grown more than 500-fold since it came
public, which isn’t quite infinity, but I sure wish I had taken that proposition.) 
Most day trading strategies have the same limited liability: You can lose what
you trade, and no more. Some strategies have unlimited liability, however. If
you sell a stock short (borrow shares and then sell them in hopes that the
stock goes down in price, allowing you to repay the loan with cheaper shares,
a strategy discussed in Chapter 14), and if the stock goes up to infinity, you
have to repay the loan with those infinitely valued shares! Most likely, you’re
going to close out your position before that happens, but keep in mind that
even if you close out your positions every night like a good day trader
should, some strategies have the potential to cost you more money than you
have in your trading account. 
73
Chapter 4: Investing, Trading, and Gambling

To protect themselves and to protect you against losing more money than
you have, brokerage firms and options exchanges will require you to keep
enough funds in your account to cover shortfalls (known as margin, dis-
cussed in Chapter 3). You will have to be approved before you can trade in
certain securities. For example, anyone trading options has to fill out an
agreement that the brokerage firm must first approve and then keep on file.
Playing the zero-sum game
Many day trading strategies are zero-sum games, meaning that for every
winner on a trade, there is a loser. This is especially true in options markets.
Now, the person on the other side of the trade might not mind being a loser;
she may have entered into a trade to hedge (protect against a decline in)
another investment and is happy to have a small loss instead of a much
larger one.
The problem for you as a day trader is that there is little wiggle room in a
zero-sum game. Every trade you make is going to win or lose, and your losses
may exactly offset your winners. If your strategy takes place in a market that
is a zero-sum game, such as the options market, make sure that you’ve tested
your strategy thoroughly (see Chapter 11 for more on that) so that you know
whether your odds are better than even. 
Finding the probability of not getting the return you expect
In addition to absolute measures of risk and liability, there’s another consid-
eration: volatility. That’s how much a security’s price might go up or down in
a given time period. 
The math for measuring volatility is based on standard deviation (discussed
in Chapters 3 and 11). A standard deviation calculation starts with the aver-
age return over a given time period. This is the expected return — the return
that, on average, you’ll get if you stick with your trading strategy. But any
given week, month, or year, the return might be very different from what you
expect. The more likely you are to get what you expect, the less risk you take
in the form of volatility.
Standard deviation shows up many times in trading, and there’s a detailed
explanation of it in Chapter 11. The key thing to know is this: The higher the
standard deviation of the underlying securities, the more risk you take with
your trade. However, the same volatility creates trading opportunities for day
traders to exploit. A security with a low standard deviation isn’t going to offer
you many chances to make money over the course of a day.
Standard deviation is used to calculate another statistic: beta. Beta tells you
how risky a security is relative to the risk of the market itself. If you buy a
stock with a beta of more than 1, then that stock is expected to go up in 
price by a larger percentage than the market when the market is up, and it’s
expected to go down by a larger percentage than the market when the market
is down.
74
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

High-beta stocks, and options on high-beta stocks, are riskier than low-beta
stocks, but they offer a greater potential for return.
The word beta comes from the capital assets pricing model, an academic
theory that says that the return on an investment is a function of the risk-free
rate of return (discussed in the next section), the extra risk of investing in 
the market as a whole, and then the volatility — beta — of the security rela-
tive to the market. Under the capital assets pricing model, there are no other
sources of risk and return. Any other sources would be called alpha, but in
theory, alpha doesn’t exist. Not everyone agrees with that, but the terms
alpha and beta have stuck.
Getting rewarded for the risk you take
When you take risk, you expect to get a return. That’s fair enough, right? That
return comes in a few different forms related to the risk taken. Although you
might not really care how you get your return as long as you get it, thinking
about the break-down of returns can help you think about your trading strat-
egy and how it works for you.
Opportunity cost
The opportunity cost of your money is the return you could get doing some-
thing else. Is your choice day trading or staying at your current job? Your
opportunity cost is your current salary and benefits. You’d give up that
money if you quit to day trade. Is the opportunity cost low enough that it’s
worth your while? It may be. Just because taking advantage of an opportunity
carries a cost doesn’t mean that the opportunity isn’t worth it.
When you trade, you want to cover your opportunity cost. Your cost will be
different than someone else’s, but if you know what it is up front, you’ll have
a better idea of whether your return is worth your risk.
There’s another way to think about opportunity cost. When you make one
trade, you give up the opportunity to use that money for another trade. That
means you only want to trade if you know that the trade is going to work out,
more likely than not. That’s why you need to plan your trades (see Chapter 2)
and backtest (run a simulation using your strategy and historic securities
prices) and evaluate your performance (see Chapter 11) so that you know
that you are trading for the right reasons, and not just out of boredom.
Risk-free rate of return and the time value of money
The value of money changes over time. In most cases, this is because of infla-
tion, which is the general increase in price levels in an economy. But it’s also
because you give up the use of money for some period of time. That’s why
any investment or trading opportunity should include compensation for the
time value of your money.
75
Chapter 4: Investing, Trading, and Gambling

In day trading, your return from time value is small, because you only hold
positions for a short period of time and close them out overnight. Still,
there’s some time component to the money you make. That smallest return 
is known as the risk-free rate of return. That’s what you demand for giving up
the use of your money, even if you know with certainty that you’ll get your
money back. In practice, investors think of the risk-free rate of return as the
rate on U.S. government treasury bills, which are bonds that mature in less
than one year. This rate is widely quoted in The Wall Street Journal and elec-
tronic price quote systems.
If you cannot generate a return that’s at least equal to the risk-free rate of
return, you shouldn’t be trading.
Risk-return tradeoff
Economists say that there is no such thing as a free lunch. Whatever return
you get, you get because you took some risk and gave up another opportu-
nity for your time and money. In that sense, there is no secret to making
money. It’s all about work and risk.
This is known as the risk-reward tradeoff. The greater the potential reward,
the greater the amount of risk you’re expected to take, and thus the greater
potential you have for loss. But if you understand the risks you are taking up
front, you may well find that they are worth taking. That’s why you have to
think about the risks and rewards up front. 
The magic of market efficiency
The reason there’s a balance between risk and reward is that markets are rea-
sonably efficient. This efficiency means that prices reflect all known informa-
tion about the companies and the economy, and it means that all participants
understand the relative tradeoffs available to them. Otherwise, you’d have
opportunities to make a riskless profit, and that’s just won’t do according to
the average economist. “You can’t pluck nickels out of thin air,” they like to
say. In an efficient market, if there’s an opportunity to make money without
risk, someone would have taken advantage of that already.
Here’s how it works: You have information that says that Company A is going
to announce good earnings tomorrow, so you buy the stock. Your increased
demand causes the price to go up, and pretty soon, the stock price is where
it should be given that the company is doing well. The information advantage
is rapidly eliminated. And in most cases, everyone gets the news — or hears
the rumor — of the good earnings at the same time, so the price adjustment
happens quickly.
76
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

Wouldn’t it be great if you could get the news of a good earnings report
before everyone else, to make a quick trading profit? Yep. At least until the
Feds show up and hauled you off to prison — talk about your opportunity
costs. It is illegal to trade on material inside information (which would be
information that is not generally known that would affect the price of the
security). And yes, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
exchanges monitor trading to see whether trading patterns suggest illegal
trading based on inside information, because they want all investors and
traders to feel confident that the investment business is fair. Be very wary of
tips that seem too good to be true.
Now, you’ll notice in the example that it was the activity of traders that
caused the price of Company A stock to go up to reflect the expected good
earnings report. The markets may be more or less efficient, but that doesn’t
mean they work by magic. Price changes happen because people act on
news, and those who act the fastest are day traders.
In economic terms, arbitrage is a riskless profit. A hard-core believer in acade-
mic theory would say that arbitrage opportunities don’t exist. In practice,
though, they do. Here’s how it works: although Company A is expected to
have a good earnings announcement tomorrow, you notice that the stock
price has gone up faster than the price of a call option on Company A, even
though premium should reflect the stock price. So, you sell Company A (bor-
rowing shares and selling it short if you have to), and then use the proceeds
to buy the option. When the option price goes up to reflect the stock price,
you can sell it and lock in a riskless profit — at least, before your trading
costs are considered. Chapter 15 discusses arbitrage in more detail. 
Investing
Investing is the process of putting money at risk in order to get a return. It’s
the raw material of capitalism. It’s the way that businesses get started, roads
get built, and explorations get financed. It’s how our economy matches
77
Chapter 4: Investing, Trading, and Gambling
The oldest economics joke ever told
So now that you’re wise to the ways of risk and
return, this joke should make sense to you:
Two economists are walking down the street.
One sees a $20 bill on the sidewalk and stops to
pick it up. “Don’t bother,” says the other. “If it
were real, someone would have taken it already.”
“Don’t be so sure,” says the first economist. He
picks it up, sees that it is real, then turns to his
friend and says, “How about if I buy you a free
lunch?”

people who have too much money, at least during part of their lives, with
people who need it in order to grow society’s capabilities. 
Investing is heady stuff. And it’s very much focused on the long term. Good
investors do a lot of research before committing their money, because they
know that it will take a long time to see a payoff. That’s okay with them.
Investors often invest in things that are out of favor, because they know 
that with time, others will recognize the value and respond in kind.
One of the best investors of all time is Warren Buffett, Chief Executive Officer of
Berkshire Hathaway. His annual letters to shareholders offer great insight. You
can read them at www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html.
What’s the difference between investing and saving? When you save, you take
no risk. Your compensation is low — it’s just enough to cover the time value
of money. Generally, the return on savings equals inflation and no more. In
fact, a lot of banks pay a lot less than the inflation rate on a federally insured
savings account, meaning that you’re paying the bank to use your money.
In contrast to investing, day trading moves fast. Day traders react only to
what’s on the screen. There’s no time to do research, and the market is
always right when you are day trading. You don’t have two months or two
years to wait for the fundamentals to work out and the rest of Wall Street to
see how smart you were. You have today. And if you can’t live with that, you
shouldn’t be day trading. 
Trading
Trading is the act of buying and selling securities. All investors trade, because
they need to buy and sell their investments. But to investors, trading is a rare
transaction, and they get more value from finding a good opportunity, buying
it cheap, and selling it at a much higher price sometime in the future. But
traders are not investors.
Traders look to take advantage of short-term price discrepancies in the
market. In general, they don’t take a lot of risk on each trade, so they don’t
get a lot of return on each trade, either. Traders act quickly. They look at
what the market is telling them and then respond. They know that many of
their trades will not work out, but as long as more than half work, they’ll be
okay. They don’t do a lot of in-depth research on the securities they trade,
but they know the normal price and volume patterns well enough that they
can recognize potential profit opportunities.
78
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

Trading keeps markets efficient, because it creates the short-term supply and
demand that eliminates small price discrepancies. It also creates a lot of
stress for traders, who must react in the here and now. Traders give up the
luxury of time in exchange for a quick profit.
Speculation is related to trading, in that it often involves short-term transac-
tions. Speculators take risks assuming a much greater return than might be
expected, and a lot of what-ifs may have to be satisfied for the transaction to
pay off. Many speculators hedge their risks with other securities, such as
options or futures.
Gambling
A gambler puts up money in the hopes of a payoff if a random event occurs.
The odds are always against the gambler and in favor of the house, but
people like to gamble because they like to hope that if they hit it lucky, 
their return will be as large as their loss is likely. 
Some gamblers believe that the odds can be beaten, but they are wrong.
(Certain card games are more games of skill than gambling, assuming you can
find a casino that will play under standard rules. Yeah, you can count cards
when playing blackjack with your friends, but it’s a lot harder in a profession-
ally run casino.) They get excited about the potential for a big win and get
caught up in the glamour of the casino, and soon the odds go to work and
drain away their stakes.
There is such a thing as a fair lottery, which takes place when the expected
payoff is higher than the odds of playing. You won’t find it at most casinos,
although sometimes the odds in a sports book or horse race favor the bettor,
at least in the short term. A more common example takes place in lotteries
when the jackpots roll over to astronomical amounts. For example, in March
of 2007, the multi-state Mega Millions lottery had a jackpot of $370 million,
but the odds of winning were 1 in 175 million. This means that a $1.00 ticket
had an expected value of $2.11, making it a fair proposition. 
Trading is not gambling, but traders who are not paying attention to their
strategy and its performance can cross over into gambling. They can view the
blips on their computer screen as a game. They can start making trades with-
out any regard for the risk and return characteristics. They can start believ-
ing that how they do things affects the trade. And pretty soon, they are using
the securities market as a giant casino, using trading techniques that have
odds as bad as any slot machine. 
79
Chapter 4: Investing, Trading, and Gambling

Managing the Risks of Day Trading
Now that you know more about the risks, returns, and related activities of
day trading, you can think more about how you’re going to run your day trad-
ing business. Before you flip through the book to find out how to get started,
consider two more kinds for risk that you need to think about:
 Business risk
 Personal risk
Business risk
Business risk is the uncertainty of the timing of your cash flow. Not every
month of trading is going to be great, but your bills will come due no matter
what. You’ll have to pay for subscriptions while keeping the lights turned on
and the computer connected to the Internet. Taxes come due four times a
year, and keyboards hold a mysterious attraction for carbonated beverages,
causing them to short out at the most inopportune times. 
Regardless of what happens to your trading account, you need cash on hand
to pay your bills or you’ll be out of business. The best way to protect yourself
is to start out with a cash cushion just for covering your operating expenses.
Keep it separate from your trading funds. Replenish it during good months.
Personal risk
The personal risk of trading is that it becomes an obsession that crowds out
everything else in your life. Trading is a stressful business, and the difference
between those who succeed and those who fail is psychological. And, in fact,
the personal risk is so great that I devote an entire chapter to managing it —
Chapter 8. Go there if anything you have read in this chapter alarms you.

Chapter 5
Fun with Regulation
In This Chapter
 Looking at a history of day trading and regulations
 Wondering who are all these regulators anyway?
 Considering some basic brokerage requirements
 Handling hot tips
 Trading for other people
T
he financial markets are wild and woolly playgrounds for capitalism at its
best. Every moment of the trading day, buyers and sellers get together to
figure out what the price of a stock, commodity, or currency should be at that
moment, given the supply, the demand, and the information out there. It’s
beautiful.
One reason the markets work so well is that they are regulated. That may
seem like an oxymoron: Isn’t capitalism all about free trade, unfettered by
any rules from nannying bureaucrats? Ah, but for capitalism to work, people
on both sides of a trade need to know that the terms will be enforced. They
need to know that the money in their accounts is there and is safe from theft.
And they need to know that no one has an unfair advantage. Regulation cre-
ates the trust that makes markets function.
Day traders may not be managing money for other investors, and they may
not answer to an employer, but that doesn’t mean they don’t have rules to
follow. They have to comply with applicable securities laws and exchange
regulations, some of which specifically address those who make lots of short-
term trades. Likewise, brokers and advisors who deal with day traders have
regulations that they need to follow, and understanding them can help day
traders make better decisions about whom to deal with. In this chapter, you
find out who does the regulating, what they look at, and how they affect you.

How Regulations Created Day Trading
With the advent of the telegraph, traders could receive daily price quotes.
Many cities had bucket shops, which were storefront businesses where
traders could bet on changes in stock and commodity prices. They weren’t
buying the security itself, even for a few minutes, but were instead placing
bets against others. These schemes were highly prone to manipulation and
fraud, and they were wiped out after the stock market crash of 1929.
After the 1929 crash, small investors could trade off the ticker tape, which 
was a printout of price changes sent by telegraph, or wire. In most cases, they
would do this by going down to their brokerage firm’s office, sitting in a con-
ference room, and placing orders based on the changes they saw come across
the tape. Really serious traders could get a wire installed in their own office,
but the costs were prohibitive for most individual investors. In any event,
traders still had to place their orders through a broker rather than having
direct access to the market, so they could not count on timely execution.
Another reason there was so little day trading back then is that all brokerage
firms charged the same commissions until 1975. That year, the Securities and
Exchange Commission ruled that this amounted to price fixing, so brokers
could then compete on their commissions. Some brokerage firms, such as
Charles Schwab, began to allow customers to trade stock at discount com-
mission rates, which made active trading more profitable. (Some brokerage
firms don’t even charge commissions anymore, but don’t worry; they get
money from you in other ways.)
The system of trading off the ticker tape more or less persisted until the
stock market crash of 1987. Brokerage firms and market makers were flooded
with orders, so they took care of their biggest customers first and pushed the
smallest trades to the bottom of the pile. After the crash, the exchanges and
the Securities and Exchange Commission called for several changes that
would reduce the chances of another crash and improve execution if one
were to happen. One of those changes was the Small Order Entry System,
often known as SOES, which gave orders of 1000 shares or less priority over
larger orders. 
Then, in the 1990s, Internet access became widely available, and several 
electronic communications networks started giving small traders direct
access to price quotes and trading activities. This meant that traders could
place orders on the same footing as the brokers they once had to work
through. In fact, thanks to the SOES, the small traders had an advantage:
They could place orders and then sell the stock to the larger firms, locking 
in a nice profit. Day trading looked like a pretty good way to make a living.
82
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

Larger institutional traders and NASDAQ market makers resented the way
that traders using SOES exploited their advantage, referring to these people
as SOES bandits.
Your library and bookstore might have older books talking about how day
traders can make easy money exploiting SOES. That loophole is long gone, so
stick to newer guides. There’s a list in the appendix.
In 2000, the Small Order Execution System (SOES) was changed to eliminate
the advantage the small traders had, but few of them cared right away. More
and more discount brokerage firms offered Internet trading while Internet
stocks became wildly popular. No one needed SOES to make profits when
Amazon.com and Webvan were going up in price day after day, at least for a
while. But then reality caught up with the technology industry, and the
market for those stocks cratered in 2000.
We’re now in a new era, with new trading practices and new regulation.
Who Regulates What
In the United States, financial markets get general regulatory oversight from
two government bodies: the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Both have similar goals:
to ensure that investors and traders have adequate information to make deci-
sions and to prevent fraud and abuse.
Neither body has complete authority over the markets, though. Instead, much
of the responsibility for proper behavior has been given to self-regulatory
organizations that brokerage firms join, and to the exchanges themselves. It’s
not straightforward, but the overlap between these organizations seems to
ensure that problems are identified early on and that the interests of compa-
nies, brokers, and investment managers are fairly represented.
Stock and corporate bond market regulation
The stock and corporate bond markets are the most prominent. Regulators
are active and visible because these markets have a relatively large number
of relatively small issuers. There’s not one government issuing currency —
there are a whole bunch of companies issuing shares of stock. When it turns
out that one of these companies has fraudulent numbers, the headlines
erupt, and suddenly everyone cares about what the SEC is up to. That’s just
the first layer in regulating this market.
83
Chapter 5: Fun with Regulation

Given the rate at which exchanges are merging and organizations are re-
arranging themselves, the following list may well be obsolete by the time you
read it. But even if the organizations go away, the regulations won’t.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
www.sec.gov
The SEC is a government agency that ensures that markets work efficiently.
The Commission has five commissioners, appointed by the President and
confirmed by Congress, who serve staggered five-year terms. This structure
is designed to keep the SEC nonpartisan. One of the commissioners is desig-
nated as the chair.
The SEC has three functions:
 To ensure that any companies that have securities listed on exchanges
in the United States report their financial information accurately and on
time, so that investors can determine whether investing in the company
makes sense for them
 To provide oversight to the markets by ensuring that the exchanges and
self-regulatory organizations have sufficient regulations in place and that
those regulations are enforced
 To regulate mutual funds, investment advisors, and others who make
decisions for other people’s money
The National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD)
www.nasd.com
The NASD represents and regulates all stock and bond brokerage firms and
their employees. More than 5,000 firms are members, with 660,000 employees
registered to sell securities. The NASD administers background checks and
licensing exams, regulates securities trading and monitors how firms comply,
and provides information for investors so that they are better informed about
the investing process. 
The NASD also requires brokers to know who their customers are and
whether an investment strategy is suitable for them. I discuss suitability 
later in this chapter, but for now, know that that’s an NASD function.
A good first stop for a day trader is the NASD’s BrokerCheck service. The
Web site address is too unwieldy to reprint here, but you can go to www.
nasd.org and click on the link to BrokerCheck from that home page.
BrokerCheck allows you to look up brokerage firms and individual brokers 
to see whether they are in good standing. If there have been any complaints
filed, you can see what they are and decide for yourself how you feel about
them. It’s great information that can help you head off problems early on.
84
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

The NASD started as a self-regulatory organization, but in the late 1960s it
saw that member firms needed a better way to trade over-the-counter securi-
ties (securities that do not trade on an organized exchange like the New York
Stock Exchange). In 1971, it formed its own electronic communication net-
work, the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation
system, or NASDAQ, pronounced as one word: “NAZ-dack.” In 2000, the NASD
divested NASDAQ, which is now known only by that name, and returned to
its self-regulatory organization roots. Although the two are now separate,
brokerage firms that trade securities on NASDAQ must be members of the
National Association of Securities Dealers.
The exchanges
Each of the major stock and bond exchanges — the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE), the American Stock Exchange (ASE), and NASDAQ — has its own reg-
ulatory body that makes sure that companies with securities traded on the
exchange meet the criteria that have been set for their listing. These criteria
include timely financial reporting with the SEC and minimum numbers of
shares that are actually traded. (Chapter 3 has a description of the different
exchanges and their listing requirements.) 
The exchanges also monitor how securities are traded in order to look for
patterns that might point to market manipulation or insider trading. Each
works with brokerage firms that are allowed to trade on its exchange to make
sure they know who their customers are and that they have systems in place
to make certain these customers play by the rules.
The NYSE used to oversee and license brokers that worked for member firms.
At the time of this writing, it is in the process of merging those functions with
the NASD. As all NYSE firms are also members of the NASD, this should
reduce much duplication of effort. 
Treasury bond market regulation
Treasury bonds are a slightly different animal than corporate bonds. They
are issued by the U.S. government, so regulation is handled by the Treasury
Department’s Bureau of the Public Debt (www.treasurydirect.gov) with
additional oversight from the SEC. 
Derivatives market regulation
The derivatives markets, where options and futures are traded, don’t deal in
stocks and bonds directly. Instead, they link buyers and sellers of contracts
where the value is linked to the value of an underlying security. Derivatives
are popular with day traders, because they give them a way to get exposure
85
Chapter 5: Fun with Regulation

to interest rates and market index performance with less capital than would
be required to buy treasury bonds or large groups of stocks directly. 
Derivatives markets have their own regulatory bodies, but they match the
format and hierarchy of stock and bond market regulation. The organizations
may not be household names, but their functions will seem familiar.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)
www.cftc.gov
The CFTC is a government agency founded in 1974 to oversee market activi-
ties in agricultural and financial commodities. The government realized that
these markets needed some regulation but were sufficiently different from
traditional stock exchanges that the SEC might not be the best agency to
handle it. The CFTC is structured similarly to the SEC, with five commission-
ers holding staggered five-year terms, appointed by the President and con-
firmed by Congress. One of the commissioners is designated as the chair.
This structure is designed to keep the CFTC nonpartisan. 
For decades, futures trading was regulated by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, because it involved nothing but agricultural commodities like
grain, pork bellies, and coffee. As traders demanded such new products as
futures on interest rates and currencies, it became clear that a new regula-
tory body was needed, and that was the CFTC.
The CFTC has two main functions:
 To ensure that the markets are liquid and that both parties on an
options or futures transaction are able to clear (that is, to meet their
contractual obligations)
 To provide oversight to the markets by ensuring that the exchanges and
self-regulatory organizations have sufficient regulations in place, and
that those regulations are enforced
National Futures Association (NFA)
www.nfa.futures.org
The NFA regulates 4,200 firms and has 55,000 employees who work on the 
different futures exchanges. It administers background checks and licensing
exams, regulates futures trading and monitors how firms comply, and pro-
vides information for investors so that they are better informed about futures
trading and how it differs from more traditional investments. 
86
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

Firms that handle futures are known as futures commission merchants, or FCMs,
rather than brokers. You can find information on FCMs and their employees
through the NFA’s Background Affiliation Status Information Center, which has
the clever acronym BASIC. You can access it at www.nfa.futures.org/
basicnet/ or through the NFA’s home page. BASIC allows you to look up
futures firms and employees to see whether they are registered and whether
any complaints have been filed against them. If there have been any complaints
filed, you can see how the problem was resolved. It’s like that legendary perma-
nent record that your elementary school teachers said would follow you for
the rest of your life.
Trading in options on stocks is regulated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers, but trading
on options on futures is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission and the National Futures Association. As the lines between
derivative products get blurrier, you may find a lot of overlap, and many in
the industry predict that the SEC and CFTC will merge at some point. Because
it’s possible to research firms and people through several self-regulatory
organizations, you may as well take the time to do it. Don’t be alarmed if
someone is listed one place and not the other, but do be alarmed if a firm or
person isn’t listed anywhere.
The exchanges
The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), Chicago Board of Trade
(CBOT), Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME, also called the Merc), New York
Board of Trade (NYBOT), New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), and other
derivatives exchanges have their own regulatory groups that ensure that
their traders comply with exchange rules and rules of other organizations,
especially the CFTC. They also develop new types of trading contracts that
satisfy market demands while complying with applicable laws. (Chapter 3 
has a description of the different exchanges and what they do.) 
The exchanges also monitor how derivatives are traded in order to look for 
patterns that might point to market manipulation or insider trading. Each 
works with the futures commission merchants that are allowed to trade on its
exchange to make sure that they know who their customers are and that they
have systems in place to make sure these customers trade well, if not profitably.
Foreign exchange (forex) regulation
Because it is the largest, most liquid market in the world, many day traders
are taking up trading in foreign exchange, also known as forex. But here’s the
tricky thing: These markets are not well regulated. There’s nothing to stop
someone from exchanging U.S. dollars for Canadian dollars; tourists do it
every day, often at a hotel desk or retail shop. There’s no paperwork, no
hassle — and no oversight.
87
Chapter 5: Fun with Regulation

Oversight isn’t necessary for someone at a convenience store buying a tube
of Smarties (no, not the horrible dry tablets wrapped in cellophane, but
rather a fine chocolate candy not available in the States, so if you cross the
border, please pick some up for me!) with bucks and getting loonies in return.
Unfortunately, this has allowed some firms to misrepresent forex trading to
day traders, and it has allowed some day traders to get badly burned.
Forewarned is forearmed, as the cliché goes.
Options and futures on currency
Most currency is traded in the spot: Traders exchange one currency for
another at the current exchange rate. The spot market is not regulated. But
many trade currency using options and futures, to bet on where exchange
rates might go and to hedge the risks of unexpected changes. Options and
futures on currency are regulated as derivatives, through the CFTC, the NFA,
and the relevant futures exchanges. In some cases, though, FCMs get cus-
tomer referrals from foreign exchange firms that are not themselves regis-
tered, which can make it unclear whether customers understand what they
are getting into.
If you are participating in an unregulated market like forex, you can protect
yourself by doing your research so that you know what the risks and rewards
are. For that matter, every market has a few unscrupulous individuals, so you
will always be better off if you find your own facts rather than rely on some-
one else. The exchanges and self-regulatory organizations all have great Web
sites with lots of information, and you can see a directory of them in this
book’s appendix.
Banks and oversight
Banks are responsible for most foreign exchange trading, and banks are 
heavily regulated. This means that the Federal Reserve Banks and the U.S.
Treasury Department are paying attention to forex markets, looking for 
evidence of manipulation and money laundering (discussed later in the 
chapter). This keeps the market from being a total free-for-all, even though
anyone is allowed to trade currency.
Bank oversight isn’t enough to protect your from the outlandish claims from
crooked forex trading firms, but it does ensure that your contracts are fulfilled.
Brokerage Basics for Firm and Customer
No matter who regulates them, brokers and futures commission merchants
have to know who their customers are and what they are up to. That leads to
some basic regulations about suitability, pattern day trading, and money
laundering — and extra paperwork for you. Don’t get too annoyed by all the
paperwork you have to fill out to open an account, because your brokerage
firm has even more.
88
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

Are you suitable for day trading?
Brokerage firms and FCMs have to make sure that customer activities are
appropriate. The firms need to know their customers and be sure that any
recommendations are suitable. When it comes to day trading, firms need to
be sure that customers are dealing with risk capital — money that they can
afford to lose. They also need to be sure that the customers understand the
risks that they are taking. Depending on the firm and what you are trying to
do, you might have to submit financial statements, sign a stack of disclo-
sures, and verify that you have received different guides to trading.
It’s no one’s business but your own, except of course that the various regula-
tors want to make sure that firm employees aren’t talking customers into
taking on risks that they should not be taking. Sure, you can lie about it. You
can tell the broker you don’t need the $25,000 you’re putting in your account,
even if that’s the money paying for your kidney dialysis. But if it’s gone, you
can’t say you didn’t know about the risks involved.
Staying out of the money Laundromat
Money laundering is the process of giving a provenance to money acquired
from illegal activities. Your average drug dealer, Mafia hit man, or corrupt
politician doesn’t accept credit cards, but he really doesn’t want to keep lots
of cash in his house. How can he collect interest on his money if it’s locked in
a safe in his closet? And besides, his friends are an unsavory sort. Can he
trust them to stay away from his cache? If this criminal fellow takes all that
cash to the bank, those pesky bankers will start asking a lot of questions,
because they know that most people pursuing legitimate business activities
get paid through checks or electronic direct deposit. 
Hence, the felon with funds will look for a way to make it appear that the
money is legitimate. There are all sorts of ways to do this, ranging from
making lots of small cash deposits to engaging in complicated series of finan-
cial trades and money transfers, especially between countries, that become
difficult for investigators to trace. Sometimes these transactions look a lot
like day trading, and that means that legitimate brokerage firms opening day
trade accounts should be paying attention to who their customers are.
Fighting money laundering took on urgency after the September 11, 2001
attacks, because it was clear that someone somewhere had given some bad
people a lot of cash to fund the preparation and execution of their deadly mis-
sion. The U.S. and several other nations increased their oversight of financial
activities during the aftermath of the strikes on the World Trade Center and

Pentagon. That’s why a key piece of paperwork from your broker will be the
anti-money laundering disclosure. The U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial
Crimes Informant Network (www.fincen.gov), which investigates money
laundering, requires financial institutions to have enforcement procedures in
place to verify that new investments were not made from ill-gotten funds. 
In order for your brokerage firm to verify that it knows who its customers are
and where their money came from, you’ll probably have to provide the fol-
lowing when you open a brokerage account:
 Your name
 Date of birth
 Street address
 Place of business
 Social Security number or Taxpayer Identification Number
 Driver’s license and passport 
 Copies of financial statements 
Special rules for pattern day traders
Here’s the problem for regulators: Many day traders lose money, and those
losses can be magnified by the use of leverage strategies (trading with bor-
rowed money, meaning that you can lose more money than you have in the
quest for large profits, discussed in great detail in Chapter 14). If the cus-
tomer who lost the money can’t pay up, then the broker is on the hook. If too
many customers lose money beyond what the broker can absorb, then the
losses ripple through the financial system, and that’s not good. 
The National Association of Securities Dealers has a long list of rules that its
member firms have to meet in order to stay in business. One, known as NASD
Rule 2520, deals specifically with day traders. It sets the minimum account
size and margin requirements for those who fit the definition of day traders,
and I’ll give you a hint: The requirements are stricter than for other types of
accounts, to reflect the greater risk.
The NASD defines day trading as the buying or selling of the same security on
the same day in a margin account (that is, using borrowed money). Execute
four or more of those day trades within five business days, and you are a pat-
tern day trader, unless those four or more trades were 6 percent or less of all
the trades you made over those five days.
90
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

The National Futures Association does not have a definition of day trading,
because futures trades by their very nature are short term. 
Here’s why it matters: If you are a pattern day trader, you can have margin of
25 percent in your account, which means you can borrow 75 percent of the
cost of the securities that you are trading. Most customers are only allowed
to borrow 50 percent. That’s because pattern day traders almost always
close out their positions overnight, so there is less risk to the firm of having
the loan outstanding. However, you have to have a margin account if you are
a pattern day trader. This means you have to sign an agreement saying that
you understand the risks of borrowing money, including that you may have to
repay more than is in your account and that your broker can sell securities
out from under you to ensure you pay what is owed. 
Under Rule 2520, you have to have at least $25,000 in your brokerage
account. If you have losses that take your account below that, you have to
come up with more money before your broker will allow you to continue day
trading. You can’t plead your case, because the broker has to comply with
the law. In fact, if you don’t make the deposits necessary to bring your
account up to at least $25,000 and at least 25 percent of the amount of money
you’ve borrowed within five business days, you have to trade on a cash basis
(no borrowing), assuming the firm will even let you trade.
The rules set by the NASD and other self-regulatory organizations are mini-
mum requirements. Brokerage firms are free to set higher limits for account
size and borrowing, and many do in order to manage their own risks better.
Tax reporting
On top of the identity paperwork, you have forms to fill out for tax reporting.
IRS Form W9 keeps your taxpayer information on record. Then, at the end of
the year, the brokerage firm sends you a 1099 form listing how much money
you made in your account. After all, the taxman always gets his cut. Tax
issues are covered in Chapter 10.
91
Chapter 5: Fun with Regulation
Money laundering: Al Capone or Watergate?
Although some believe that the term money laun-
dry dates back to Al Capone’s attempts to evade
taxes by owning laundries — businesses that
had a large amount of small cash transactions —
the Federal Reserve Board says that the term
didn’t come into use until the Watergate scandal,
when Nixon’s campaign staff had to hide the
money used to pay the people who broke into his
opponent’s psychiatrist’s office.

Hot Tips and Insider Trading
The regulations are very clear for things about suitability and money launder-
ing. You get a bunch of forms, you read them, you sign them, you present
documentation, and everyone is happy. The rules that keep the markets 
functioning are clear and easy to follow.
There’s another set of rules that keep markets functioning — namely, that 
no one has an unfair information advantage. If you knew about big merger
announcements, interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve, or a new
sugar substitute that would eliminate demand for corn syrup, you could
make a lot of money in the stock market, trading options on interest rate
futures or playing in the grain futures market.
Insider trading is not well defined. Any non-public information that a reason-
able person would consider when deciding whether to buy or sell a security
would apply, and that’s a pretty vague standard — especially because the
whole purpose of research is to combine bits of immaterial information
together to make investment decisions. 
Day traders can be susceptible to hot tips, because they are buying and sell-
ing so quickly. If these hot tips are actually inside information, though, the
trader can become liable. If you get great information from someone who is in
a position to know — an officer, a director, a lawyer, an investment banker —
you may be looking at stiff penalties. Civil penalties are usually three times
your profits, but the government might decide that your trading was part of a
criminal enterprise, making the potential penalties much greater.
Insider trading is difficult to prove, so federal regulators use other tools to
punish those it suspects of making improper profits. Martha Stewart wasn’t
sent to prison on insider trading charges; she was charged with obstructing
justice by lying to investigators about what happened. 
Whenever a big announcement is made, such as a merger, the exchanges go
back and review trading for several days before to see whether there were
any unusual activities in relevant securities and derivatives. Then they start
tracing it back to the traders involved through the brokerage firms to see if it
was coincidence or part of a pattern.
The bottom line is this: You may never come across inside information. But if
a tip seems too good to be true, it probably is, so be careful. 
92
Part I: Day Trading Fundamentals 

Taking in Partners
Once your day trading proves to be wildly successful, you might want to take
on partners to give you more trading capital and a slightly more regular
income from the management fees. You can do it, but it’s a lot of work.
If you are trading options and futures, you need to register with the National
Futures Association if you’re operating a commodity pool or working as a
commodity trading advisor. If you’re trading stocks and bonds, you have to
register with the Securities and Exchange Commission unless you meet the
exemption tests that would let you operate as a hedge fund instead. 
Registration is not a do-it-yourself project. An error or omission may have
tremendous repercussions, including fines or jail time, down the line. If you
want to take on partners for your trading business, spend the money for qual-
ified legal advice. It will protect you and show prospective customers that
you are serious about your business.
To qualify as a hedge fund, which is a private investment partnership that
does not qualify for registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
you have to deal only with accredited investors (those with at least $1 million
in net worth or an annual income of $200,000) or qualified purchasers (those
with $5 million in investable assets). The idea is that these people should
have enough money to lose and be able to understand the risks that they 
are taking. Hedge funds do not have to register with the SEC, but they may
have to register with the NFA. However, prospective investors will want to
see proof that you know what you are doing and know how to handle their
money. That step is beyond the scope of this book, but it’s something for a
successful day trader to consider.

Setting Up Your Accounts 
and Office
In This Chapter
 Finding out what to look for in a brokerage firm
 Choosing from the many brokers you have to pick from
 Getting equipped to trade
 Playing a trading arcade
D
ay trading is possible only because technology costs have come down
dramatically over the years. That makes it feasible to set up shop in the
comfort of your home. But remember: This is a home business, so you do
need to set up for it.
Sure, some days you can sit and trade from your laptop in a coffee shop, but 
to end up doing that well, you first need to commit to the space and the equip-
ment at home. If you skimp on your Internet connection, for example, you can’t
be upset if it’s unable to handle the data on a big market day. If your PC goes
down, you’d better have a way to get it back up fast if you have open positions.
And if the responsibility seems overwhelming, maybe you should look for a
trading arcade — an office space for traders — and move your operation there.
In this chapter, I list different brokers that handle day traders, go over the basics
of your office setup, and give you some advice on finding a trading arcade. 
Choosing a Brokerage
If you are going to trade, you need a brokerage account. Chapter 3 covers
some of the basics of different types of securities and where they trade.
That’s the first place to start.

If you’re going to trade stocks, you need a full-service broker that belongs to
NASDAQ, the New York Stock Exchange, and other major exchanges.
If you’d rather trade the stock market through the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange’s E-Mini index futures, then you need a futures trading account
with a broker holding a seat on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
Many day traders pursue two or three strategies, which may require holding
different brokerage accounts. That’s not unusual. If you are going to trade
grain futures and tech stocks both, you might want one account with a
futures brokerage that belongs to the Chicago Board of Trade and another
account with a stock brokerage that offers fast execution.
Direct access to pricing and trading
All brokerage firms offer price quotes: a summary of the current bid and offer
prices for selling or buying the security in question. But not all of these price
quotes are the same. Some are offered in real time — meaning that you see
the prices as soon as your modem can transmit the change to you. Others are
delayed, sometimes by seconds, sometimes by minutes. If you are buying a
bond with plans to hold it for ten years, then the difference in price between
now and fifteen minutes ago probably isn’t material. But if you are looking to
day trade in the bond market using short-term changes in treasury futures,
then a delay of even 30 seconds might be the difference between your strat-
egy succeeding or failing.
Direct access brokers allow you to see the price quotes in real time so that
you can act on them immediately, and they allow you to work through differ-
ent electronic communications networks rather than going through the firm’s
own traders. Almost all day trading strategies need direct access in order to
maximize profitability.
A traditional retail brokerage, by contrast, offers customers more research
and advice and may even improve order execution by waiting until market
conditions are more favorable. That’s fine for investors, but not so good for
day traders.
In addition to different levels of market access, brokerage firms offer different
types of price quotes with different amounts of detail. Read on for descrip-
tions and pictures to see what you need for your strategy.
Faster, detailed price quotes are valuable to traders, so brokerage firms usu-
ally charge more them. Don’t skimp on price services at the expense of your
trading profitability.
98
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

Level I quotes
Level I quotes give you the current bid and ask, or bid and offer, prices for a
given security. The bid, of course, is the price at which the broker buys the
security from you, and the ask, also called offer in some markets, is the price
at which the broker offers to sell the security to you. A Level I quote also
shows the size of the most recent buy and sell orders. 
Most brokerage firms offer real-time Level I quotes for free, but these num-
bers do not have enough detail for day trading.
Level II quotes
Level II quotes not only tell you what the current bid and offer prices are, but
they also tell you who the market makers are — the brokerage firm traders
who are buying and selling the security — and what size orders they have at
different prices (Figure 6-1). This information can help you gauge the volatil-
ity and direction of trading in the market, and that can help you make more
profitable trades. Most brokerage firms that specialize in day trading offer
Level II quotes in most markets.

TotalView quotes
TotalView quotes show all orders in the market for a given security, both
attributed to market makers and anonymous (Figure 6-2). This gives traders
the most detailed information about what’s happening in the market. It may
be overkill for some trading strategies, but vital to the success of most. You’ll
have a better idea of how much information your trading strategies need
after you test them using the advice in Chapter 11.
Type of platform
When you have an account with a brokerage firm, you have a way to get 
information about the markets and place your orders. The conduit is the
Internet, but there has to be a way to get your orders to it. Some brokerage
firms have their own software that you can use; others allow you to log in
through a Web site. 
Software-based platforms
With a software-based platform, you have to download and install the broker-
age firm’s proprietary system onto your computer. When you are ready to
start your trading day, you connect to the Internet first, launch the software
to see what’s happening, and place your trades. Software systems generally
offer more features and analytical tools, but you can only trade on a machine
that has the software loaded on it.
Web-based platforms
With a Web-based trading platform, you go to the broker’s Web site and log in
to trade. This means you can trade from any computer that has Internet
access, which is a boon if you travel or work from several different locations.
In exchange, you may give up some of the analytic and backtesting tools
offered through software-based platforms.
Note that Web-based platforms may be designed to work on specific Web
browsers. Given the importance of having a stable connection and full func-
tionality in a fast-moving market, if the firm recommends using Internet
Explorer, accept that. Don’t cling to a preferred alternative.
What about mobile platforms? Some brokerage firms allow you to get price
quotes and place trades through a mobile phone. This may be useful to some
people, but it’s a bad idea for most day traders. Day trading is a business, and
that means you need some discipline about setting regular hours and working
from a regular workspace. You will probably need more information to work a
trade than will fit on your phone’s screen. Finally, you need to take a break
from the market in order to maintain balance in your life. If you’re making
trades at your cousin’s wedding, you’re probably a little out of balance.

Chapter 6: Setting Up Your Accounts and Office

How to open an account
When you open a brokerage account, you have a lot of paperwork to fill out
in order to comply with government and exchange regulations. I explain all
the laws behind these in Chapter 5. The firm needs to ensure that you are
suitable for day trading; that you understand the risks of options, futures,
and margin strategies; and that your trading money did not come from ill-
gotten gains. 
After you fill out and sign the paperwork, you need to transfer funds. Most
brokers require a minimum investment of $25,000 to open a day trading
account (some set this lower and some higher). Write a check or set up a
wire or Internet transfer from an existing bank, brokerage, or mutual fund
account.
Brokers Offering Day Trading Services
Following is a list of brokerage firms with services for day traders. It’s
arranged by specialty (stocks and general trading, options and futures, for-
eign exchange) and then alphabetically within each category. It’s not exhaus-
tive. Keep in mind that every year, new firms are formed, and existing firms
are acquired or merged away, so be sure to do your own research. Also, this
list does not imply an endorsement of anyone’s services. 
Barron’s (www.barrons.com), the weekly financial newspaper, has a regular
column discussing electronic trading firm issues and concerns, many of
which are of interest to day traders. Each winter, Barron’s conducts a survey
of online brokerage firms with updates on the latest features and rankings
based on such criteria as technology, usability, additional features, customer
service, and trading costs. Check it out when you’re ready to research.
Brokers for stocks and a bit of the rest
Day traders almost always work through online brokerage accounts. Many
firms offering these accounts handle trading in almost all securities. The
firms usually belong to all the exchanges, so you can trade almost anything
anywhere in the world through them. They often offer a range of news and
charting services to help you plan your trading. In some cases, their offerings
may be overkill — you not only might not need all their services, you might
find them distracting. Some may not handle your security of choice well. 
102
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

Brokerage firms don’t make money just on the commission charged per
trade. Other sources of revenue include monthly service charges, fees for
real-time quotes, interest on margin loans to customers, and the spread,
which is the difference between what you pay for a security and what the
firm paid to get it. Don’t let the commission be the critical factor in deciding
among brokerage firms. Think about the services you will need and the rela-
tive cost to you of different account offerings.

Brokers for options and futures
To effectively day trade options and futures, you need an account with a

market.

Brokers for foreign exchange
The foreign exchange, or forex, market is the largest trading market in the
world. It has lots of opportunities for day traders to make (or lose) money.
Most forex trades take place between banks, corporations, and hedge funds
directly, without the use of a broker. If you want to trade this directly, you
need to use a trading firm that is tied in to these networks. Many of the 
brokers listed above offer forex, and here are a few that do little else.

Equipping Your Trading Laboratory
Twenty years ago, you would have had to pay millions of dollars for the
equipment and telecommunications networks that you can now have in your
own home for just a few thousand bucks or so. 
108
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

You may be thinking, I can do it for free! I have a PC in a corner of the family
room, I have Internet access, what else do I need? Ah, but you need plenty.
Remember, successful day traders approach trading as a professional activ-
ity. That means starting off with an adequate work space and dedicated
equipment. If you can’t give up an entire room in your house, find a corner or
hallway where you can put a desk and a computer just for day trading. It will
clear your mind so that you can focus on the work at hand. 
Where to sit, where to work
You need a table and a chair. Don’t borrow a chair from the dining room, but
instead get a good desk chair that will swivel around and adjust to you as you
work. You’ll need a shelf and a cabinet of some sort to hold your files and
documents, too.
Want to get more comfort for the dollar in a desk chair? Consider shopping
for used chairs at office equipment dealers. They may come with a few scuffs,
but they will probably have more ergonomic settings than chairs at office
supply superstores.
There’s no rule on the layout of your equipment, but the more you can see
and do without getting up from your chair, the better off you’ll be. If you find
yourself getting sore at the end of the day, investigate ergonomic products
such as special keyboards, contoured mice, wrist pads, and foot rests, all of
which are readily available at office supply stores.
Counting on your computer
You can’t day trade without one computer, and you might want two or three:
one to trade from, one for everything else (such as spreadsheets, email,
instant messaging), plus a spare in case the trading computer goes down.
(See the section “The department of redundancy department” later in this
chapter.)
Almost every personal computer on the market today has the power to
handle day trading activities, so you don’t need to sweat over the details. 
In general, faster processing speeds are better than slower ones, and more
memory and storage are preferable to less. 
What about the manufacturer? Well, you probably don’t want an Apple
Macintosh for day trading, because it’s possible that not all the software
packages you’ll need will be Mac-compatible. If you are one of those die-hard
Mac heads, though, be sure to ask brokers and software vendors about com-
patibility. Other than that, it doesn’t matter much.
109
Chapter 6: Setting Up Your Accounts and Office

See it on the big screen
Do yourself a favor and spend money on a big flat-screen monitor, at least 19
inches on the diagonal, so that you can see what’s happening in the markets.
If you need to look at more than one window at once, say to see charts and
Level II quotes at the same time, consider using two or more monitors
hooked to the same PC. That way, you’ll have a clear view of necessary data.
(Most traders work with at least two monitors, because the information they
need is too valuable.)
Connecting to the Internet
If you are day trading, you should hook up to the Internet with as much band-
width as possible — at least a 1.5/256 DSL line. This means that you can
download data at 1500 kilobits per second while uploading at 256 kilobits per
second. Your Internet service provider might charge more for faster perfor-
mance, and most day traders will find the price to be worth it. If prices are
changing quickly, a delay of half a second can be costly.
A great source of information about the performance of different broadband
Internet providers is Broadband Reports, www.broadbandreports.com.
Invest in a firewall and virus protection for your trading PC, but be careful
how you do it. Some software will protect your system at the expense of a
slow data feed, which will hurt your trading execution. If you decide to go
naked — operate without a firewall or virus scanner in order to maintain opti-
mal speed — be sure to have a second computer at the ready. When you set
your virus scanner, be sure that any automatic downloads or background
scans take place after market hours, so that they can’t slow you down.
Strangely enough, a phone is optional these days. You will rarely if ever need
to place a trading-related call.
The department of redundancy department
When you’re day trading, you are intentionally looking at volatile markets and
fast-moving securities, because that’s where you’ll have the most opportunity
to make money in a short time. You may very well be leveraged, either through
the use of borrowed money or by trading securities with built-in leverage, such
as futures. (I have a lot more to say about leverage in Chapter 14). If you’re in a
position that moves against you and you can’t get out, you’re sunk.
110
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

It’s bad enough if you can’t get out because the markets are melting down
because of some kind of global catastrophe. But suppose you can’t get out
because the batteries in your wireless mouse have died and you can’t find
new ones? What if you spill pop and short out your keyboard — or your PC?
What if the developer building a McMansion next door accidentally knocks
out your phone line and your DSL service? At a minimum, have a cellular
phone charged and ready to go so that you can execute trades by phone. All
these little workaday calamities have happened to me — and trust me, they
are downright annoying if you aren’t trading. If you are, they can be ruinous.
If you are serious about making money as a day trader, build in redundant
systems as much as possible:
 If it’s available in your area, subscribe to two Internet service providers,
one cable and one DSL. When one goes out, you can switch.
 Have two computers that are duplicates of each other, so that you can
swap them out if one goes down.
 Keep extra supplies on hand: extra batteries, extra keyboard, and extra
mouse. You want to be able to react quickly when things go wrong.
These are all cheap to keep in inventory, too, because the computer
makers give keyboards and mice away with every new PC.
 Consider investing in an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) backup for
your PC, so that if the power goes down, your computer will stay up. You
don’t need a backup generator, though — unless you think that you’d still
want to trade after your town was devastated by an earthquake or a hur-
ricane. (Of course, it’s those crises that create opportunities!)
 Finally, back up your computer regularly. You can do it online through
Mozy (www.mozy.com) or through a backup drive connected to your
PC. Most backup systems can be set up to work automatically, but don’t
do it during trading hours or it will slow you down.
Taking a Trip to a Trading Arcade
Don’t want to set up your own office? Not ready to commit to two Internet
lines, three PCs, and four monitors? Worried you’ll be bored and lonely work-
ing alone at home? Consider trying a trading arcade. These are offices where
day traders rent desk space to trade. Some provide additional services along
with the real estate, such as training, coaching, and even loans of trading cap-
ital. Some charge a flat weekly or monthly fee, some offer services on an a la
carte basis, and others take a share of your trading profits.
111
Chapter 6: Setting Up Your Accounts and Office

Although trading arcades are less popular than they were a decade ago, they
still exist in many major cities. To find them, you can do an Internet search
on trading arcade or trading room and your town’s name. You are more likely
to find one if you live near a city with major exchanges that are phasing out
floor trading — namely, New York and Chicago.
Before choosing an arcade, find out about its fees and services. Talk to other
traders to see what they like and dislike about the operation. And keep in
mind that the firm may want to check you out.

Research and Trading Services
In This Chapter
 Figuring out where to get a trading education
 Supplementing your trading with research 
 Checking out vendors before you spend your money
D
ay trading is big business with big profits, but those profits don’t always
accrue to the day trader. Instead, many a day trader has spent money
on training services, software, newsletters, and coaching, only to find that in
the real world, the trader can’t make enough money to make a living, let
alone cover all these costs.
Why does that happen? It could very well be because the trader isn’t cut 
out for day trading in the first place. Day trading isn’t for everyone. In other
cases, though, the trader failed to do good research before plunking down
the cold cash for training in a system that just wasn’t very good.
You’ve already plunked down $24.99 for Day Trading For Dummies. Consider
that an investment! In this chapter, I cover some of the different services that
day traders might want to buy and give you advice on how to determine
which ones are worthwhile and which are not.
The Trade of Trading
As much as I wish that Day Trading For Dummies told you everything you’d
need to know about trading, it’s only a starting point. And let’s hope that
Wiley’s marketing department doesn’t see that, because otherwise they’ll be
mad at me. The fact is that there are so many different assets you can trade
and ways to trade them, no one resource can give you all you need. A stock
trader following a news-based momentum strategy needs different services
than a forex trader looking at interest rate discrepancies. That’s why I don’t
teach you, but rather point you to resources that can help you get started
and show you how to get the most value from the money you spend. 

Day trading is a career. Every career takes time to master, and practitioners
have to work to keep their skills up as the field changes. You’ll find you’ll
need some training to get started, and more training to be successful,
whether you are trading futures, building bridges, or doing heart surgery.
Freebies from the exchanges
Before you spend more money, check out what several different exchanges
and self-regulatory organizations offer for free to help you get started in 
trading. They have “Webinars,” online courses, and plenty of reading mater-
ial. After all, the financial industry wants people to trade — that’s how they
make money — but they want them to be successful, because that keeps 
the market functioning. (Exchanges are businesses, like any other.) Going
through such free material first can give you a great sense of how suitable
you are for a given strategy and help you make better decisions about the
other training you will need.
In this section I list a few resources that are particularly good for new day
traders.
Chicago Board Options Exchange Learning Center
www.cboe.com/LearnCenter/default.aspx
The Options Institute of the Chicago Board Options Exchange offers a series
of online tutorials, classes, and seminars covering exchange-traded options
in great depth. It also has a two-day seminar for experienced traders who
want to come to Chicago. The site includes online toolboxes and calculators
as well as a chance for traders to ask questions of options trading experts.
Chicago Board of Trade Classes/Training
www.cbot.com/cbot/pub/page/0,3181,1130,00.html
The Chicago Board of Trade has online tutorials on trading futures, agricul-
tural commodities, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It also offers online
seminars on trading strategies and psychology, papers discussing different
trading methods, and downloadable manuals (in English, Spanish, and
Chinese) that teach different aspects of specific commodities, whether poul-
try feed or treasury interest rate futures.
Chicago Mercantile Exchange Education Center
www.cme.com/edu/
Whether you’re an individual who wants to learn about futures or an experi-
enced floor trader who needs to make the transition to electronic trading, the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange has information for you. It has online training
114
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

courses in trading in general and trading futures in particular, live online
events in specific trading techniques, and papers that describe and analyze
different trading strategies. The site even has links to trading simulators
offered by different futures commission merchants (brokerage firms that 
specialize in futures), so you can apply what you learn without risking real
money.
The exchanges have been merging and consolidating, so by the time you get
this book, some of these may be combined or operating under different
names — and that means the links won’t work. No matter what happens,
they’ll still be offering educational services so that the people participating in
their markets can be more effective. You can find up-to-date links by doing
simple Web searches using such keywords as futures exchange or options
exchange.
Institute for Financial Markets
www.theifm.org
The Institute for Financial Markets is a nonprofit organization that provides
basic training programs for people working on the options and futures
exchanges. Many of its courses are inappropriate for day traders, who aren’t
going to be licensed and who do not have mandatory continuing education
requirements to maintain those licenses. But some of them are appropriate,
and a few are low-cost or even free. Recent offerings include the basics of
derivatives and trading strategies.
NASDAQ
www.nasdaq.com/services/onlineInvesting.stm
Okay, let’s be honest here: The stock markets want to promote investing
more than trading, because they want companies to issue stock on their
exchanges. The kind of high volatility that day traders love puts off some
starchy corporate officers. Hence, much of the information on NASDAQ’s site
is about how to select stocks for the long term. Still, there’s some information
that might be useful to a prospective day trader.
National Futures Association Investor Learning Center
www.nfa.futures.org/investor/investorLearningCenter.asp
The National Futures Association is the self-regulatory organization for the
agricultural and financial futures exchanges. This site includes a lot of good
information about trading futures as well as a tutorial on trading foreign
exchange. 
115
Chapter 7: Research and Trading Services

New York Stock Exchange
www.nyse.com/audience/individualinvestors.html
The New York Stock Exchange, like NASDAQ, wants to court investors rather
than traders. Still, the exchange’s site has information on trading stocks,
bonds, and exchange-traded funds that can make you smarter on those
topics without spending a dime.
Hitting the road for conferences
Although day trading is a deskbound pursuit, you might want to get out to
learn more about trading and research different companies with products for
day traders. Many of the exchanges and larger day trading brokerage firms
have their own seminars and conferences, but a few are open to the public.
Brokerage firms offering many seminars and training programs may have
higher commissions than firms offering less service, but it may be worth it,
especially as you get started. You can learn more about some brokerage firms
that work with day traders in Chapter 6.
The Money Show
www.moneyshow.com
The Money Show is a series of investment conferences held in different major
cities around the country. Registration is free, which means that once you
show up, people will be trying to sell you stuff. This could be distracting to
an established trader but helpful for a new trader looking to find out more
about all the different software and services out there. The conferences also
have high-profile speakers, so you can learn from Wall Street celebrities. The
Money Show Web site includes articles, podcasts, and free online courses to
help you learn more about trading.
Trading Forum
www.traderslibrary.com/tlforum/registration.asp
The Trading Forum is sponsored by Traders’ Library, which sells research
materials and investing books. The conference isn’t cheap, but it covers spe-
cific trading strategies and information. It offers a good introduction to trad-
ing, especially if the conference happens to be close to where you live.

Taking training classes
Although it’s not necessary, many day traders learn the game by enrolling in a
training program, ranging from a graduate-level certificate in options offered
jointly by Northwestern University and the Chicago Board Options Exchange
to DVDs hawked on late-night infomercials. No program can guarantee suc-
cess, nor is any one program right for every trader. I list a few bigger and
better-known programs here, but check them out to make sure they are right
for you — just as you should check out programs that aren’t listed here.
The larger brokerage and research firms offer their own training courses, often
at little or no cost. Consider those as a first option, but keep in mind that their
introductory sessions might be sales pitches for more products and services.
Marketwise
www.marketwise.com
Marketwise has a series of online courses in stocks, options, and futures 
trading. Clients log on at a specific time, and the instructor uses real market
data to show them what they need to know. It also has live seminars and one-
on-one mentorship programs.
Pristine
www.pristine.com
Pristine has a range of books and DVDs, online and in person classes, and
coaching services in English and Spanish covering trading skills that work 
in most markets. Its courses operate at different levels, with some requiring
extensive trading experience using specific software packages.
Schneider Tradercourse
www.tradercourse.com
Schneider Tradercourse offers training in futures and foreign exchange to
both professional and individual investors from its offices in London. Some of
its programs are weekend seminars, and the company also offers telephone
coaching to help traders solve problems.
Secrets of Traders
www.secretsoftraders.com
One thing I like about this company’s Web site is that you are expected 
to read a disclaimer about the risks of trading before you get to the good
stuff. Many of the company’s programs are designed for floor traders at the
exchanges who need to learn to trade futures electronically in order to stay
competitive. The course includes books and DVDs.
117
Chapter 7: Research and Trading Services

TradingSchool.com
www.tradingschool.com
TradingSchool.com, based in Los Angeles, has a series of online and in-person
classes covering trading psychology as well as trading in stocks, options,
financial futures, and currencies. The firm works with day traders as well as
money managers and other long-term investors. 
The University of Trading
www.universityoftrading.com
The University of Trading offers courses in options, equities, foreign
exchange, and financial and agricultural commodities online and at its offices
in Chicago. Students have the opportunity to trade alongside experienced
instructors as well as hear lectures on different aspects of the markets. The
company trains professional traders, some of whom trade for themselves and
some of whom take jobs with others.
There are plenty of great and legitimate training firms out there — as well as
a lot of scammers. Run from anyone who guarantees your success. I include
some information about due diligence at the end of this chapter.
Learning to play at a trading arcade
Many larger cities have day trading arcades, which are offices where traders
can rent desk space and get all the quotes and analytics they need to trade.
Traders pay monthly rent and may also share some of their profits with the
arcade, especially if it provides any training and coaching services.
Trading arcades were the only way to day trade before the widespread avail-
ability of high-speed Internet access. They are seeing resurgence as trading
moves off the floor of exchanges and into electronic communications net-
works. Most new trading arcades are clustered near the exchanges and cater
to floor traders who are learning how to trade electronically. However, some
will work with people who are completely new to trading.
You can find trading arcades through Internet searches, by contacting the
options and futures exchanges to see if they know of any that are members (I
have in my possession a 2006 directory of trading arcades in Chicago, put out
by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange), or by checking online directories such
as www.trade2win.com/traderpedia/Trading_Arcade_Index.

Day traders need a trading system, and they often rely on subscription
research services. That’s fine, as long as those systems are adding value over
and above their cost. Unfortunately, advising day traders is big business, and
there may be more money in that than in day trading. Before you call the 800
number given in the infomercial, here’s some advice to help you evaluate the
service.
There are three main types of outside services:
 Price data are detailed, real-time price quotes from different markets.
 Chart services help traders identify profitable trends.
 Strategic research helps people develop a system for trading or follow a
system designed by someone else.
You may need all three, or none, depending on your knowledge of the finan-
cial markets and your trading style.
Many day traders find themselves subscribing to price quote and analytical
services. The following section is a listing of a handful of popular ones. It’s
not a definitive list, and this is not an endorsement. Rather, it’s a guide to get
you thinking about what you might need and where you might go to get it.
If you know you’ll need outside pricing and data services, consider that when
you are selecting a brokerage firm. Different firms have different software
platforms, and some can handle outside data feeds better than others.
(Price) quote me on that
In Chapter 6, I list some of the many brokerage firms that offer day trading
services. They all have services that tell you what the prices are for any secu-
rity at any time, but this doesn’t mean that they have all of the prices that
you need for your strategy. For example, if you are day trading common
stocks, you may need a system that can signal certain price patterns in any 
of the thousands of stocks trading at any given day. If you are trading options
based on the value of underlying stock, you may need that data as well. If you
are day trading international securities, you may need real-time data, and
your broker might only offer data with a ten-minute delay in some markets.
Besides needing all the prices and related volume and market-maker data,
some strategies involve fast trading. Scalping, for example, involves making 
a large number of quick transactions in search of small price movements.
Every second counts, and not all brokers can deliver prices fast enough to
119
Chapter 7: Research and Trading Services

make scalping profitable. One solution is to get prices from a separate source
offering faster delivery. Other trading strategies don’t require real-time prices
on huge numbers of securities, but they may involve a detailed analysis of
end-of-day prices. To do that, you may need more information than your
broker can give you.
The quote service can provide the data in real time only if you have enough
bandwidth to receive it. Make sure you have the fastest Internet service and
modem available in your area, and consider having a second way to connect
to the Internet if your primary service goes down.
CQG
www.cqg.com
CQG pulls data from more than 90 different exchanges, making it popular
with people who are trading international securities. Traders can buy histori-
cal data for backtesting (see Chapter 11 for more), and they can add charting
and order routing capabilities to their CQG package. Data can be linked to
Microsoft Excel spreadsheets for people who want to do even more number
crunching on their own.
DTN 
www.dtn.com
Trading fuel or agricultural products? Then you might need more research
than most brokers can give you. DTN provides pricing and research for com-
modities traders, including meteorological research and hurricane-related
energy supply forecasts. Day traders active in stocks or financial futures are
more likely to use the company’s IQ data feeds, which allow users to track
1,300 prices at once, and ProphetX, software that combines price data with
analytics that can track small market movements and can handle displays on
several different monitors at once.
eSignal
www.esignal.com
eSignal offers detailed prices, news, and trading alerts in most financial 
markets. Its charting features are more advanced than those offered by most
brokerage firms. Especially useful for traders who are looking at several 
different stocks, eSignal can help identify trading opportunities using a pre-
ferred strategy and scan the market for other stocks that meet specified
investment criteria. The company also offers backtesting and real-time strat-
egy testing, end-of-day analysis for traders who don’t need real-time data, as
well as add-on signals that support different proprietary trading strategies.

InstaQuote
www.dafsoft.com
InstaQuote’s data is designed for equity options traders. It gives traders price
quotes on options and equities alike so that they can identify price discrep-
ancies and monitor valuation. It then connects to the exchange’s electronic
communications networks, allowing for direct access trading. InstaQuote’s
platform can work with several different brokerage firms. 
Charting your strategy
Almost all day trading strategies rely on technical analysis, which is the
process of identifying buy and sell opportunities based on the supply and
demand for a security. Technical analysts look at charts of price and volume
changes to look for changes in the trend. (It’s discussed in more detail in
Chapter 12.) Some technical analysis strategies are complicated and require
sophisticated charting. That’s why many day traders use software that can
turn price data into the information they need to make decisions.
Many users of these services get tripped up by the symbols and data dis-
plays. Take the time to learn as much as you can about how they work before
you’re trading in real time with real money; most of these providers offer
seminars or online tutorials that will help. Yeah, many of the features are
obvious, but you want to avoid costly mistakes. 
MarketDelta
www.marketdelta.com
MarketDelta’s software provides detailed charting services that match differ-
ent strategies over several time periods, in colors that make the data stand
out. The company mostly deals with professionals, but it has some products
suitable for some day traders.
Metastock
www.equis.com
Metastock has several different charting and analytical packages, including one
for foreign exchange trading, another for people who day trade in stocks, and a
third for stock investors who are holding for longer than a single day. Traders
following specific strategies recommended by different market analysts can
purchase add-ons that give them the tools needed to trade effectively.

NinjaTrader
www.ninjatrader.com
NinjaTrader is a trading platform for active traders. It can be used instead of
a brokerage firm’s trading software, or it can be used on its own. The service
is best known for its charting capabilities in the foreign exchange and futures
markets, but it can also handle market scanning, automated trade execution,
and backtesting, and simulation trading.
OmniTrader
www.omnitrader.com
OmniTrader is designed to automate technical analysis (read all about that 
in Chapter 12), especially for stock traders. The system also includes money
management tools (money management is discussed in Chapter 9) as well as
simulated trading and backtesting to help you find new strategies.
RealTick
www.realtick.com
RealTick combines data with charting services and market signals for stocks,
options, futures, and foreign exchange, making it useful for traders who are
working in several markets. The service includes direct access trading
through several different brokerage firms.
Trade-Ideas
http://trade-ideas.com
Trade-Ideas is designed for stock traders. The software scans the incoming
price data feed to find trading opportunities based on prespecified indica-
tors, and it can also show how much the market is deviating from a trader’s
style. For traders watching hundreds or thousands of stocks, this can be a
useful addendum to a brokerage firm’s offerings.
Newsletters, gurus, and strategic advice
Trading relies on information so that everyone in the market can evaluate
what the right price for a security should be. Most of this information can 
be found from an analysis of the news and the price data, both of which are
readily available from brokerage firms and quote services. But many traders
follow explicit philosophies or rely on the insight of certain analysts. Here’s a
list of some of the bigger ones that you will come across, in case you want to
find out more. Many of the specific theories will be discussed in more detail
in Chapter 12.
122
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

Many of these market gurus have good ideas, but don’t follow any of them
blindly. Their techniques don’t work in all markets at all times. Besides,
anyone with a truly foolproof plan isn’t going to give it away. These news-
letters are just part of the ongoing conversation in the markets that help
traders make decisions. 
Elliott Wave
www.elliottwave.com
The Elliott Wave is a theory that markets move in grand cycles over a century
or more. Within that, there are subcycles lasting years, months, weeks, days,
minutes, and seconds. Given all the layers and analysis required, those who
follow the theory usually subscribe to research services to help them. This
site is maintained by Robert Prechter, who is one of the leading scholars of
the theory.
The Marlin Newsletter
www.marlinletter.com
This newsletter is published by two long-time traders at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade. They give their 
analysis of the financial futures markets, especially those on the Dow Jones
Industrial Average and the treasury markets. The company also offers train-
ing and a chat room where instructors and analysts discuss real-time trading
opportunities.
School of Gann
www.schoolofgann.com
The Gann method of technical analysis looks at the slopes of the charts to
predict changes. It’s a complicated system, so traders who follow it usually
rely on newsletters and research services to help them. School of Gann is one
that specializes in this system.
Trending 123
www.trending123.com
Trending 123 publishes newsletters on technical analysis in the U.S.,
Canadian, and English stock markets and in foreign exchange. It also offers
software and email alerts that point out opportunities in the markets based
on their analytical system. The company regularly covers psychological
aspects of trading to support its customers.
123
Chapter 7: Research and Trading Services

The power of the printed word
Several books cover specific aspects of trading psychology, trading strategy,
and research systems in much more detail than I can in the space that the
good folks at Wiley have given me. If you turn to the appendix, you’ll see a list
of other resources that can help you in your research. 
Day trading was a hot topic in the late 1990s, and you may find that a lot of
the books and articles on the subject date from that era. Some are lurking in
your public library; others are still available for sale or can be found on the
Internet. Markets change. Don’t rely on a system popularized a decade ago
unless you’ve tested it and ensured that it still works. 
Doing Your Due Diligence
Trading software, training, and research can get expensive, and some of it is
an outright scam. Most of it is legitimate, but that doesn’t mean it’s right for
you. Before you spend your money, do your research. Start with the free pro-
grams offered by the exchanges (listed in the first section of this chapter) so
that you have enough knowledge to understand what a trading services pur-
veyor is trying to do. Then, do some research and ask some questions. To
find out where to go and what to ask, read on.
Where to start your research
You have a ton of tools available to you to do your due diligence. A good first
place is the Internet. Go to your favorite search engine and enter the name of
the program you’re looking at plus the word scam or rip-off and then see what
turns up. If nothing of much interest turns up, proceed to the regulatory
agencies listed here. 
It’s possible that you’ll learn very little about any given research firm from an
Internet search or checks with the different regulatory organizations. That
doesn’t mean the firm in question isn’t for real, just that it hasn’t caused any
concerns so far.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission
www.cftc.gov/cftc/cftccustomer.htm
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulates futures markets,
which are popular with day traders. At this part of the site, you can check out
investor advisories, known scams, and recent enforcement efforts to see
whether the vendor you’re thinking of working with is legitimate or too good
to be true.

National Futures Association BASIC
www.nfa.futures.org/BasicNet/
Futures are popular with day traders, and they are regulated by the National
Futures Association. Its Background Affiliation Status Information Center
(BASIC) gives you information on people and firms registered with the
National Futures Association. 
NASD BrokerCheck
www.nasd.com/InvestorInformation/InvestorProtection/
The National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) provides this handy
service that lets you check on the current enforcement status of different
brokerage firms and their employees, especially in the stock, bond, and
options markets. (Click the “Check the Background of Your Investment
Professional” link.) Some of these firms and people may be offering research
services or newsletters, so check to see whether they’ve had problems.
Securities and Exchange Commission
www.sec.gov/investor.shtml
The Securities and Exchange Commission has a ton of great information
about every aspect of stock and bond investing, with a special emphasis on
problems and scams to avoid. Don’t let it scare you away from the market;
use it to evaluate any services that you’re thinking of paying for.
Questions to ask
Once you do your basic background checks, it’s time to ask some questions
about the service providers you’re considering. This section contains a list of
questions to get you started.
Do not trust any promises of performance. Day trading is a difficult business.
Many people wash out because it doesn’t suit their personality. Others fail
because they don’t have enough startup capital, they don’t take the time to
figure out how to do it, or they simply have a run of bad luck. No one can
promise that you will succeed. 
 Can I get a free trial to check the service out?
 What training and support do you offer?
 How long will it take me to learn the system? Will I need to pay for addi-
tional training and coaching, or is your built-in support adequate?
125
Chapter 7: Research and Trading Services

 Who will be teaching me or advising me, and what is this person’s 
background?
 How long have you been in business? Why was the company formed?
 What additional features are available at additional costs? How many
customers subscribe to only the basic system?
 Will this support my trading style and work with the assets I prefer to
trade? 
 Do you screen traders for your program? Do you ask traders to leave?
What are the characteristics of those who do well? Of those who don’t
do well?
 Can I talk to other customers? 
 Is your software compatible with my broker? With other services 
I’m using? With my computer’s operating system? With my Internet
bandwidth?
 Are your performance numbers actual, or are they hypothetical and
based on backtesting? How were the numbers calculated? (Chapter 11
has more information on performance calculation.)
Hypothetical performance is based on an analysis of what would have hap-
pened had the system been in place in the past or of what might happen if
market conditions cooperate. It can be subject to data mining, which means
that the system was developed to generate good performance in backtesting,
not because it has any logical or theoretical basis.

Managing the Stress 
of the Markets
In This Chapter
 Reading cautionary tales of traders gone wrong
 Finding out how to control your emotions
 Checking out the paramount trading plan
 Avoiding the dangers that lurk on the Internet
D
ay trading can be a ruthless business. Some days, you don’t find any
trades worth making. Other days, you find trades, but they don’t work
out the way you want them to. And some days, there are too many good
trades, more than you can possibly make, and so you watch profitable oppor-
tunities slip away. When you’re working with real money, it can be too much
to take.
In a money management or brokerage firm, traders have tremendous cama-
raderie. They are working for the same employer and need to stick together
to blow off the stress. What do you do at home, though? How do you keep
from panicking, getting depressed, or otherwise letting this business hurt
your profits and hurt you?
If you’re going to day trade, you need to understand the very real physical
and psychological stresses that the market pushes on its participants. In this
chapter, I offer some information and advice that can help you avoid a crisis.
First, the Cautionary Tales
Trader lore is loaded with stories of people who flamed out in spectacular
and destructive ways. People who work on trading desks or on trading floors
tell tales of colleagues who went down, walked off the desk, broke down in
the pit, or died at the trading post. They can tick off colleagues who are 

alcoholics, who suffered bitter divorces, who committed suicide. Even though
day traders usually work by themselves, stories of their self-destructive behav-
ior abound. 
Sure, many day traders lead pleasant lives and suffer no more problems than
any other person. That’s because they have perspective, balance, and the
right personality for the business. Know what can go wrong, because it can
help you keep in the right.
Jesse Livermore
Jesse Livermore is sometimes considered to be the father of day trading. 
He’s the subject of the book Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin
LeFevre, a classic book about trading (see the Appendix for more informa-
tion). Livermore was born in 1877 and started trading stocks when he was in
his teens. He claimed to have made $1,000 when he was 15, which may not
seem like much, except that he was very young and price levels were a little
different in 1892. (That $1,000 would be worth over $20,000 in today’s dol-
lars.) He made huge fortunes betting against the market in 1907 and again in
1929, and he managed to lose it all both times. By 1934 he was broke and
depressed. He attempted suicide in 1935 and succeeded in 1940. 
Mark Barton
Mark Barton lost $105,000 day trading and he snapped. On July 27, 1999, he
bludgeoned his wife and two children to death. Then he went to the down-
town Atlanta offices of Momentum Securities, a brokerage firm that special-
ized in working with day traders. He had an appointment to deliver $50,000
so that he could cover his losses and start trading again. Instead, he took out
a gun, opened fire, and killed four people. He then went to the offices of All-
Tech Investment Group, another day trading firm where he had an account,
and killed another five people. Barton killed himself before he was arrested.
This case is one of the worst workplace massacres in the United States, and it
did as much as the 2000 meltdown in NASDAQ technology stocks to reduce
the enthusiasm for day trading.
Anecdotal suicides, divorces, alcoholism
Because not that many people day trade consistently, not a lot of good demo-
graphic studies have been conducted on just how many day traders end up
128
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

abusing drugs and alcohol, getting divorced or becoming estranged from
friends, and turning to suicide. The anecdotal evidence is pretty strong,
though. People in the securities business face high pressure and real dollar
losses every day they go to work. Their performance is constantly judged by
the market, and it doesn’t grade on a curve. If you spend even a few minutes
talking to people in the business, you hear horror stories. I personally know a
trader who set fire to his house, killing his 90-year-old mother in the process,
to get the insurance proceeds to cover his financial shortfalls. (He’s currently
doing a 190-year sentence.)
Don’t be the person who finally gives researchers enough critical mass to
report on day trader self-destruction. Stress is a real part of day trading, and
not all day traders handle it well. If you know what you’re up against and pre-
pare for it, you’ll be better off than many.
Controlling Your Emotions
The key to successful day trading is controlling your emotions. After all, the
stock doesn’t know that you own it, as equity traders like to say, so it isn’t
going to perform well just because you want it to. This can be infuriating,
especially when you are going through a draw-down of your capital. Those
losses look mighty personal. 
Traditional financial theory is based on the idea that traders are rational. In
practice, however, most of them are not. In fact, traders and investors are
often irrational in completely predictable ways, which has given birth to a
new area of study called behavioral finance. It’s a hot area generating Nobel
Prize winners, and it may eventually help people incorporate measures of
investor behavior into buy and sell decisions.
You have to figure out a way to manage your reactions to the market, or you
shouldn’t be a day trader. Almost to a one, day traders talk about their ene-
mies being fear and greed. If you panic, you’ll no longer be trading to win, but
trading not to lose. There’s an important distinction: If your goal is not to
lose, you won’t take appropriate risk, and you won’t be able to respond
quickly to what the market is telling you. 
This is all much easier said than done. Human beings are emotional crea-
tures, constantly reacting (and sometimes overreacting) to everything that 
is happening in their lives. Knowing the emotions that affect trading and
having some ways to manage them can greatly improve your overall 
performance. 
129
Chapter 8: Managing the Stress of the Markets

The big five emotions
When it comes to trading, five big emotions can take over and mess up your
strategy and your returns. At this point in your life, you may already know
whether you have tendencies toward some of them. If so, trading can exacer-
bate them. If you’ve never experienced them, you might for the first time.
Here’s a list and some descriptions so that you know what you’re up against
and can plan accordingly. I include some tips that can help, but if you are
really in the throes of an emotional crisis that affects your trading, you
should seek out professional help.
Anxiety
Anxiety is the anticipation of things going wrong, and it often includes a phys-
ical response: perspiration, clenched jaws, tense muscles, heart palpitations.
Anxious people worry, agonize, overanalyze, and generally stress out. And
then they avoid whatever it is that makes them upset. That means that a
trader might not make an obvious trade, but instead hesitate and miss a
market move. He might hold on to a losing position too long because he’s
worried about the effect that selling it will have on his portfolio. He becomes
too nervous to trade according to his plan, and his performance suffers.
One way to fight trading anxiety is to concentrate on following the trading
plan, not on making a set amount of money. That way, following the plan
becomes more automatic, and you spend less time worrying about what can
go wrong.
Boredom
Here’s the ugly truth about day trading: It can be really dull. In an eight-hour
trading session, you might spend seven and a half hours waiting for the right
opening. A flurry of trades, and it’s all over. To keep yourself entertained, you
might start making bad trades, spending too much time in chat rooms, or let-
ting your mind wander away from the task at hand. None of those things is
conducive to profitable trading. 
If you are really bored and tempted to do something stupid, close out your
positions and take a break. Going for a walk or quitting early can clear your
head and help you focus when you get back. Remember, day traders work for
themselves, and one of the benefits of that is that there is no boss to find out
that you knocked off early. Take advantage of that!
Depression
Depression is a severe downturn in your mood, especially one that causes
you to feel inadequate and lose interest in things you used to like. Although
everyone is susceptible to depression, the ups and downs of the market can
make traders particularly vulnerable. At best, depression can make it hard
for a trader to face a day with the market. At worst, it can lead to alcoholism,
alienation, and even suicide. 
130

If you think you might be depressed, check out the handy quiz at www.med.
nyu.edu/psych/screens/depres.html. Or better yet, go to your doctor. 
Fear
Fear is one of the worst emotional enemies of the day trader. Instead of trying
to make money, the fearful trader is trying hard not to lose it. She is so afraid
of failing that she limits herself, doesn’t take appropriate risk, and questions
her trading system so much that she no longer follows it, no matter how well
it worked for her in the past.
By the way, it isn’t just failure that traders fear. Many fear success, sometimes
for deep-seated psychological reasons that I am in no position to address. A
trader who fears success may think that if she succeeds, her friends will treat
her differently, her relatives will try to take her money, and that she will
become someone she doesn’t want to be. 
One way to limit fear is to have a plan for the trading business. Before you
start trading, take some time — maybe half a day — to sit down and think
about what you want, what will happen to you if you get it, and what will
happen to you if you don’t. For example, if you lose your trading capital, then
you’ll have to live on your walk-away fund (see later in this chapter) until you
find another job. If you make a lot of money, then you can pay off your mort-
gage and your friends will be none the wiser.
Greed
Greed seems like a silly thing to have on this list. After all, isn’t the whole pur-
pose of day trading to make money? This isn’t charity, this is capitalism at its
purest. Ah, but there’s a popular saying down at the Chicago Board of Trade:
“Pigs get fat, but hogs get slaughtered.”
Traders who get greedy start to do stupid things. They don’t think through
what they are doing and stop following their trading plans. They hold posi-
tions too long in the hope of eking out a return and sometimes they make
rash trades that look an awful lot like gambling. The greedy trader loses all
discipline and eventually loses quite a bit of money.
If your goal is simply to make more and more money, you might have a prob-
lem with greed. Sure, everyone wants to make more, but there are also a
basic need-to-make number (enough to cover your costs and your basic living
expenses) and a want-to-make number (enough to cover costs, basic expenses,
and extras that are important to you). If you know what those numbers are,
you’re well on your way to preventing the problem.
Limit orders, which automatically close out positions when they hit set
prices, are one way to force discipline in the face of greed. You can learn
more about limit orders in Chapter 2. 
131
Chapter 8: Managing the Stress of the Markets

Having an outlet
Successful day traders have a life outside of the markets. They close out their
positions, shut off their monitors, and go do something else with the rest of
the day. That’s the whole idea behind day trading.
The problem is that there is always a market open somewhere. Traders work
overnight and after hours through electronic communications networks and
sometimes move the action to exchanges in other parts of the world. Without
something to mark a beginning and an end to your trading day, and without
other things happening in your life, the market can consume you in a way
that’s simply not healthy.
So as you plan your life as a day trader, think about what else you’re going to
do with your days. Exercise, meditation, socializing, and having outside inter-
ests are key to maintaining balance and staying focused on the market when
you have to be.
Exercise
Exercise keeps your body in fighting shape so that you can stand up to
market stress and react to trends when you need to. Many times when you’re
trading, you have huge rushes of adrenalin that you can’t do much about.
You have to stay in front of your screen until the trade is over, no matter how
much you want to run away screaming. But after the trading day, you can hit
the track or pool or treadmill and burn off some of that adrenalin. Figuring
out a regular exercise routine can pay off for your trading.
If you aren’t an exerciser now, call your local YMCA. They have introductory
programs that can teach you how to use the equipment and help you design
a workout that suits your current fitness levels and goals.
Meditation
You may have closed out your positions and shut down your monitors, but
the day’s trading may keep playing itself out over and over in your head.
When you are trading, you may get upset and start thinking about everything
else that has ever gone wrong in your life, instead of staying focused on the
task at hand. Trading, therefore, requires mental discipline. Good traders can
keep their minds clear of everything but their trading system, at least when
the markets are at their hairiest. 
One way to develop that discipline is to take up meditation. Yeah, it may
seem goofy, being a big tough trader type doing something woo-woo like
meditation, but if you have trouble keeping your focus, you really might want
to take it up. There are an almost infinite number of meditation styles, many
of which are associated with different religious traditions, so you can surely
find something that works.
132

Check out the instructions for the Buddhist mindfulness meditation practice
at www.shambhala.org/meditationinstruction.html as a way to get
started.
Friends and family
Day trading is a lonely activity. You’re working by yourself all day. It’s just
you, your room, and your screen. It’s really isolating, and if you don’t get
other human contact, you’ll personalize the market so that you don’t feel so
lonely. That’s bad, because the market isn’t a person; it’s an agglomeration of
all the financial activity taking place, and it has no interest in you whatsoever. 
No matter what you do in life, you want to have the support of the people
you know and love. And you need to make time for them, too. Start and end
your trading day at regular times, and be sure to make plans to see people
who are important to you. Going to your kid’s ball game, having dinner with
your spouse, and seeing your buddies for a few beers on a regular basis can
go a long way to keeping your life in balance — and that will keep your trad-
ing in balance.
If you like pets, consider getting one to keep you company during the day.
There’s nothing like a dog that needs a walk to force you to close up shop for
the night.
Hobbies and other interests
A lot of people get into day trading because they have long had a fascination
with the market. Trading goes from being a hobby to being a living. In many
ways, that’s perfect. It’s so much easier to go to work if you have a job that
you love.
But if the market is your only interest, then you’re going to be too susceptible
to its gyrations and you’re going to have trouble sticking to your trading dis-
cipline. Plus, whatever upsets you during the trading day is more likely to
carry over. So find a new hobby if you don’t have one. Maybe it’s a TV show, a
sport, or knitting, but whatever it is, you need to have something going on
outside of your trading.
Trading is just one part of your life.
Support systems
Exercise and friends and family and hobbies and the like are all well and
good, but they don’t directly address the mindset of trading. Ah, but there’s a
veritable industry of support for traders, and it’s easy to tap into. Many day
traders find that reading books, hiring a coach, or finding other day traders
helps them get through the day.
133
Chapter 8: Managing the Stress of the Markets

Books
A library-full of books have been written on the psychology of trading itself.
In addition, many traders rely on other self-help and history books for inspi-
ration and ideas. (I think every trader I’ve ever known owns a copy of Sun
Tzu’s The Art of War, which is about military strategies and tactics. They find
that it helps them prepare their minds to face the market, or at least gives
them something interesting to talk about.) I list several books in the
Appendix that might help you organize your mind and keep your enthusiasm
for the market.
Counseling and coaching
Because it takes a lot of mental toughness to handle big losses — and big
gains — many traders find professional support. They use counselors, psy-
chologists, or life coaches to help them deal with the challenges of the market
and understand their reactions to it. You can ask other traders or your doctor
for a referral, or check the online directory at Psychology Today’s Web site, www.
psychologytoday.com, or the International Coach Federation, www.coach
federation.org. When interviewing coaches or counselors, ask whether
they have experience with traders or others who work in finance.
Many day trading training and brokerage firms also offer coaching services
that specialize in helping people learn and follow day trading strategies.
Some day traders find these people to be invaluable, whereas others find
they are just glorified salespeople. 
Some day trading coaches may be more interested in selling you specific
trading strategies rather than helping you manage your own system. Check
references and find out what other forms of compensation the coach receives
before signing up.
Finding other traders
To offset the loneliness of trading alone, many day traders choose to work
out of trading rooms operated by brokerage firms (see Chapter 6 for more on
this) or join organizations where they will meet other traders. These may be
formal or informal groups (I list a few in the Appendix) where traders can
socialize, learn new things, or just commiserate.
Many day traders get together through Internet message boards and chat
rooms, which I discuss in more detail later in this chapter. These groups 
are less formal, more anonymous, and sometimes more destructive than 
supportive. 
Most day traders lose money and give up their first year. You may find that
spending too much time with other traders is more depressing than supportive.

Watching your walk-away money
A lot of traders have a secret that lets them get through the worst of the mar-
kets. It’s something called walk-away money, although traders sometimes use
more colorful language to describe it. It’s enough money that they can walk
away from trading and do something else. 
And just exactly how much is it? Well, it varies from person to person, but
having enough money to pay three months’ worth of expenses on hand and
in cash is a good place to start. If you know that you can pay the mortgage
and buy the groceries even if you don’t make money trading today, you’ll be
better able to avoid desperate trading. You won’t have to be greedy, and you
won’t have to live in fear.
The more money in your walk-away fund, the better. Then you have more
time to investigate alternative careers should day trading prove not to be
your thing, and you can relax more when you face the market every day.
Most day traders quit after a year or so. There’s nothing wrong with deciding
to move on and try something else. If you have some money saved, then you’re
in a better position to control when you stop trading and what you do next.
If all your trading capital is gone, you might be tempted to tap your walk-
away fund to stay in the game. Don’t. That’s the exactly the time that you
should use your walk-away money to walk away, if only for a short time to
clear your head and rethink your strategies. Otherwise, your trading losses
may become financial ruin.
Importance of a Trading Plan
You may have noticed that trading plans pop up several times in this book, such
as in Chapters 2, 8, 12, and 13. That’s because they are so important to maintain-
ing the discipline that leads to trading success. You have to know what you’re
doing and how to recognize entry and exit points and then go and do it.
In this section, I cover how you can use a trading plan to manage stress and
give you a few tips for sticking to your trading plan even as the markets
sometimes move against you.
Problems following direction
Was that written on all your report cards? I hope not. A good, tested trading
plan sets out market patterns that work often enough that you can make
135
Chapter 8: Managing the Stress of the Markets

good trading profits. But some people have trouble following their plan, and
that leads to stressful mistakes. 
Prevent choking!
In sports lingo, an athlete who chokes starts playing so carefully that he or
she looks like a beginner. This is often caused by over-thinking — by being so
afraid of failure that the mind slows down and breaks the play down step by
step. It’s not pretty to watch a contender break down in a championship
game. The fans want to see a good match.
Anyone in a high-performance situation can choke. When a trader chokes, he
seems to be following the plan, but it’s no longer automatic. Trading becomes
so slow and deliberative that obvious trades get missed. 
The more you trust your plan, the less likely you are to choke. Has it been
tested? Are there parts that you can automate? Chapter 11 has some ideas on
how to measure a trading plan’s performance before you start to trade with
the plan. 
Reducing panic
Panic occurs when you just stop thinking. Your most basic survival instincts
take over, even when they are totally uncalled for. You’re losing money? You
start to trade more and more, off-plan, in a desperate gamble to win it back.
You’re making money? You close out all your trades right now so that you
can’t possibly lose, even if your plan tells you to hold your positions. When
you panic, you can’t think straight, and you can’t follow your plan.
One problem is that when your positions are down, and you seem to be
losing money, you really should be buying and sticking it out so that you can
make money later. That’s tough to do and requires a lot of discipline. Traders
learn to avoid panic with experience.
You’re probably going to have more than a few losing trades when you get
started. In your trading diary (see Chapter 11), keep notes about how it
makes you feel to lose money. Can you handle it emotionally? If losing upsets
you too much, you might not be cut out for day trading. You can’t trade with
a clear head if you’re bogged down with negative thoughts.
Confidence versus ego 
Day trading requires a lot of confidence, because you are going to lose money
and you are going to get beaten up some days. But you not only have to remain
confident in the face of adversity, you also have to be careful that you do not
cross from confidence into an inflated ego. The more your trading success
and failure become part of your personal identity, the more trouble you are
going to have. 
136
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

What’s the difference between confidence and ego? It’s “I’m smart enough to
figure out what the market is telling me” vs. “I’m smarter than the market.”
The difference is crucial to your success.
Revising and troubleshooting 
your trading plan
Strong discipline is key to success in trading, but only if you’re disciplined in
following the right system. If your trading method is flawed, then sticking to it
is going to hurt you. If something isn’t working, don’t get mad at the system;
take some responsibility and make some changes.
How do you figure out whether your trading system is right and what
changes to make? Go through your trading diary (see Chapter 11 for how to
set one up) and ask yourself some questions:
 Why did you choose this system? What is the market telling you about
it? Is it telling you that the system works if you follow it, or is it telling
you that there’s something wrong with the underlying assumptions.
What works for someone else might not work for you. There’s no flaw in
admitting that you made a mistake and that you need to make a change.
 Were your mistakes because you followed the plan, or because you didn’t?
 What part of the system is causing the trouble? Are you having trouble
identifying entry points or exit points? Or are you stuck when it comes
time to enter the trade, causing you to miss a point? Or is it that the
trades your system identifies never seem to work out?
Once you know where the problem is, you can change it.
 Can you improve your trade efficiency? Is there a way to reduce the
number of mistakes? Would automating some or all of your trading help?
One way to get your confidence back while still staying in the market is to trade
in very small amounts so that your profits and losses don’t really matter. Trade
100 shares, not 1,000 shares. You give up the upside for a time, but you can also
get out of the cycle of greed and fear that has destroyed many a trader.
The Follies of Chat Rooms
Spend any time on the Internet researching day trading and you’ll come
across the chat rooms and message boards that some traders use to exchange
137
Chapter 8: Managing the Stress of the Markets

information. Or at least you’ll come across the chat rooms and message
boards that purport to be used by traders to exchange information. 
Chat rooms were quite the thing in the first big wave of day trading, in the
late 1990s. They don’t have quite the influence that they once did, but some
day traders still rely on them. Some are excellent, help people learn to trade,
and offer good perspectives on market action. Others are a distraction at
best. In this part, I cover some of the benefits and risks so that you know
what you are getting into before you make that first post.
Support group or group think?
Many day traders turn to chat rooms for the camaraderie and support they
offer. It seems so great to find other people who are going through the same
things that you are! They understand what’s happening!
Or do they? I could make a very strong argument that traders who really know
what they are doing don’t want anyone else to know who they are or what
their plan is. Several successful day traders that I talked to while researching
this book refused to have their names in it, because they are happier staying
off the radar. Meanwhile, even those day traders who make money have trou-
ble making enough money to stick to the business for a long time. 
To compound the problem, the people in a chat room might get so agreeable
that they start reinforcing bad advice. Instead of getting support to help you
through a rough time, you get dragged down.
In general, a message board that charges a subscription fee is likely to be of
better quality than one that’s free, just because the fee wards off the people
who aren’t serious. I’ve listed a few in the appendix. But no matter what you
pay, spend some time lurking — watching the comments without making any
yourself. Proprietors of good message boards usually offer temporary access
to prospective subscribers to help them evaluate the service. Check to see
how people treat each other, what experiences they have, and how their trad-
ing systems match yours. And limit your time and watch your reactions to
people’s postings. 
Getting angry at nothing
From the very early days of newsgroups and Internet Relay Chat, people
exchanging ideas on the Internet have managed to misunderstand each other
and blow small things out of proportion. That’s all well and good if you’re
138
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

talking about the latest season of American Idol, but it’s not so good if you’re
day trading. The market is a tough-enough evaluator of your performance.
You don’t need to waste time, energy, and confidence on someone who, inten-
tionally or not, makes a nasty comment on a message board.
At a minimum, try to limit your message board activities to market hours.
And if you’re one of those people who are quick to anger (hey, I won’t tell), it
may be best to avoid online discussions with other day traders all together.
Sabotage
Now, here’s one other nasty truth about day trader chat rooms: Sometimes
the people posting are trying to manipulate the market and sabotage other
traders. They plant false and misleading information, seek to undermine
others’ confidence, and otherwise try to seek an edge by bringing others
down. In other words, there may not be much information value at all, and
the value of camaraderie may be quite low, too.
The Internet is a wonderful thing, and it makes it possible for people to trade
sophisticated financial instruments in real time from the comfort of home.
But it has its limitations, and online interaction with other traders can actu-
ally add to the stress of day trading. Tread carefully.

uch of this book is designed to give you ideas about whether to day
trade at all, what you want to trade, and how you want to trade it. That
leaves one remaining issue: how much of your money to put on the line each
time you trade. Risk too much, and you can be put out of business when you
lose your capital. Risk too little, and you can be put of out business because
you can’t make enough money to cover your costs and time. 
Over time, many academic theorists and experienced traders have developed
different systems of money management designed to help traders, investors,
and even gamblers manage their money in order to maximize return while
protecting capital. In this chapter, I explain how some of the better-known
systems work so that you can figure out how to best apply them to your own
trading.
Some of the material in this chapter is related to leverage, which is borrowing
money to trade. Leverage can dramatically increase the money that you have
available to trade as well as the risk and return profile of the trades that you
make, so it affects how you manage your money. Flip to Chapter 14 for more
information on leverage and why you might want to use it.

What’s Your Expected Return?
Before you can figure out how to manage your money, you need to figure out
how much money you can expect to make. This is your expected return,
although some traders prefer the word expectancy. You start by laying out
your trading system and testing it (described in Chapter 11). You are looking
for four numbers:
 How many of your trades are losers?
 What’s the typical percentage loss on a losing trade?
 How many of your trades are winners?
 What’s the typical percentage gain on a winning trade?
Let’s say you determine that 40 percent of the time a trade loses, and it loses
1 percent. Sixty percent of the time, the trade wins, and winning trades are up
1.5 percent. With these numbers, you can calculate your per-trade expected
return, like this:
% of losing trades × loss on losing trades + % of winning
trades × gain on winning trades = expected
return
Which in this example, works out to be:
.40 × –.01 + .60 × .015 = –.004 + .009 = .005
On average, then, you would expect to earn a half a percent on every trade
you make. Make enough trades with enough money, and it adds up.
You are more likely to make more money if you have a high expectation of
winning trades and if those winners are expected to perform well. As long as
there is some probability of loss, you stand to lose money. 
The Probability of Ruin
Expected return is the happy number. It’s how much money you can expect
to make if you stay in the trading game. But it has a counterpart that is not so
happy but is at least as important: the probability of ruin.
As long as there is some probability of loss, no matter how small, there is
some probability that you can lose everything when you are trading. How
142
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

much you can lose depends on how large each trade is relative to your
account, the likelihood of each trade having a loss, and the size of the losses
as they occur. 
Figure 9-1 shows the math for finding R, the probability of ruin.
A is the advantage on each trade in Figure 9-1. That’s the difference between
the percentage of winning trades and the percentage of losing trades. In the
expected return example discussed earlier, trades win 60 percent of the time
and lose 40 percent of the time. In that case, the trader’s advantage would be:
60% – 40% = 20%
C is the number of trades in an account. Let’s assume that we’re dividing the
account into ten equal parts, with the plan of making ten trades today. The
probability of ruin today is 1.7 percent (Figure 9-2).
Now, 1.7 percent isn’t a high likelihood of ruin, but it’s not zero, either. It
could happen. If your advantage is smaller, if the expected loss is larger, or if
the number of trades is fewer, then the likelihood becomes even higher.
Figure 9-3 shows you the relationship between the trader’s advantage, number
of trades, and the corresponding probability of ruin, rounded to the nearest
percentage.

Chapter 9: Managing Your Money and Positions

The bigger the edge and the more trades you can make, the lower your prob-
ability of ruin. Now, this model is a simplification in that it assumes that a
losing trade goes to zero, and that’s not always the case. In fact, if you use
stops (automatic buy and sell orders, described in Chapter 2), you should
never have a trade go to zero. But you can see steady erosion in your account
that will make it harder for you to make money. Hence, probability of ruin is a
useful calculation that shows whether you will lose money in the long run. 
The more trades you can make with your account, the lower your probability
of ruin. That’s why money management is a key part of risk management.
Why Size Matters
As long as there is some chance of losing all your money, you want to avoid
betting all of it on any one trade. But as long as there is a chance of making
money, you want to have enough exposure to a winning trade so that you can
post good profits. How do you figure it out?
Later in this chapter, I describe some of the different money management sys-
tems that traders use to figure out how much money to risk per trade. But
first, I want to explain the logic behind a money management system, so that
you understand why you need one. That way, you can better manage your
funds and improve the dollar returns to your trading.
Valuing volatility
Expected return gives you an idea of how much you can get from a trade on
average, but it doesn’t tell you how much that return might vary from trade
to trade. The average of 9, 10, and 11 is 10; the average of –100, 10, and 100 is
also 10. The first number series is a lot narrower than the second. The wider
the range of returns that a strategy has, the more volatile it is.

Part II: Day Trading Tools 

There are several ways to measure volatility. One common one is standard
deviation, which tells you how much your actual return is likely to differ from
what you expect to get. There’s a detailed explanation of the standard devia-
tion calculation in Chapter 11. The higher the standard deviation, the more
volatile, and riskier, the strategy. 
In the derivatives markets, volatility is measured by a group of numbers known
as the Greeks: delta, gamma, vega, and theta. They’re based on calculus.
 Delta is a ratio that tells you how much the option or future changes in
price when the underlying security or market index changes in price.
Delta changes over time.
 Gamma is the rate of change on delta. That’s because a derivative’s
delta will be higher when it is close to the expiration date, for example,
then when the expiration date is further away.
 Vega is the amount that the derivative would change in price if the
underlying security became 1 percent more volatile.
 Theta is the amount that a derivative’s price declines as it gets closer to
the day of expiration.
Day traders seek out more volatile securities, because they offer more oppor-
tunities to make money during any given day. That means they have to have
ways to minimize the damage that might occur while being able to capitalize
on the upward swings. Money management can help with that.
Staying in the market
You only have a limited amount of money to trade. Whether it’s $1,000 or
$1,000,000, once it’s gone, you’re out. The problem is that you can have a
long string of losing trades before the markets go in a direction that favors
you and your system.
Let’s say you trade 100 percent of your account. If you have one trade that
goes down 100 percent, then you have nothing. If you divide your account
into ten parts, then you can have ten total losers before you are out. If you
start with ten equal parts and double each time you lose, you can be out after
four losing trades.
The riskier your trading strategy, the more thought you need to put into money
management. Otherwise, you can find yourself out of the market in no time. 
On the other hand, if you divide your account into 100 portions, then you can
endure 100 losing trades. If you trade fractions of your account, then you can
keep going infinitely, or at least until you get down to a level that’s too low to
place a minimum order. (That’s the philosophy behind the Kelly Criterion,
145
Chapter 9: Managing Your Money and Positions

described later in this chapter.) Money management can keep you in the game
longer, and that will give you more opportunities to place winning trades.
Considering opportunity costs
Opportunity cost is the value you give up because you choose to do some-
thing else. In trading, each dollar you commit to one trade is a dollar that you
cannot commit to another trade. Thus, each dollar you trade carries some
opportunity cost, and good traders seek to minimize this cost. During the
course of the trading day, you may see several great trades, and some oppor-
tunities will show up before you are ready to close out a different trade.
If you have committed all your capital to one trade, you will miss out on the
second. That alone is a good reason to keep some money on the table each
time you trade.
Money Management Styles
Over the years, traders have developed many different ways to manage their
money. Some of these are rooted in superstition, but most are based on dif-
ferent statistical probability theories. The underlying idea is that you should
never place all of your money in a single trade, but rather put in an amount
that is appropriate given the level of volatility. Otherwise, you risk losing
everything too soon.
Calculating position size under many of these formulas is tricky stuff. That’s
why brokerage firms and trading software packages often include money
management calculators. Check Chapter 6 for more information on the bro-
kers and Chapter 7 for more on different software and research services.
This is only a sample of some methods. There are other methods out there,
and none is suitable to all markets all the time. Folks trading both options and
stocks may want to use one system for option trades and another for stock
trades. If that’s your situation, you have one big money management decision
to make before you begin: how much money to allocate to each market. 
Fixed fractional 
Fixed fractional trading assumes that you want to limit each trade to a set
portion of your total account, often between 2 and 10 percent. Within that
range, you’d trade a larger percentage of money in less risky trades and at
the smaller end of the scale for more risky trades. (In other words, it’s not all
that “fixed,” but no one asked me to pick a name for the system.)
146
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

The fixed fractional equation is shown in Figure 9-4.
N is the number of contracts or shares of stock you should trade, f is the
fixed fraction of your account that you have decided to trade, equity is the
value of your total account, and trade risk is the amount of money you could
lose on the transaction. Because trade risk is a negative number, you need to
convert it to a positive number to make the equation work. Those vertical
bars in the equation (||) are the sign for absolute value, and that means that
you convert the number between them to a positive number.
This means that if you have decided to limit each trade to 10 percent of your
account, if you have a $20,000 account, and if the risk of loss is –$3,500, your
trade should be what is shown in Figure 9-5.
Of course, you probably can’t trade .57 of a contract, so in this case, you
would have to round up to one.
Fixed ratio
The fixed ratio money management system is used in trading options and
futures. It was developed by a trader named Ryan Jones, who wrote a book
about it. (Check the Appendix for more information.) In order to find the opti-
mal number of options or futures contracts to trade, N, you use the equation
shown in Figure 9-6.

Chapter 9: Managing Your Money and Positions

N is the number of contracts or shares of stock that you should trade, P is
your accumulated profit to date, and the triangle, delta, is the dollar amount
that you would need before you could trade a second contract or another lot
of stock. (This is not the same delta measure discussed previously, which is a
measure of volatility.)
For example, the minimum margin for Chicago Mercantile Exchange E-Mini
S&P 500 futures contract, which gives you exposure to the Standard & Poor’s
500 stock index, is $3,500. Until you have another $3,500 in your account, you
can’t trade a second contract. If you are using fixed ratio money management
to trade this future, your delta will be $3,500.
If your delta is $3,500, and you have $10,000 in account profits, you should
trade 1.2 contracts (see Figure 9-7). In reality, that means you can only trade
one contract or two contracts, nothing in between. That’s one of the imper-
fections of most money management systems.
The idea behind fixed ratio trading is to help you increase your exposure to
the market while protecting your accumulated profits. 
Gann
William Gann developed a complicated system for identifying securities
trades. Part of that was a list of rules for managing money, and many traders
follow that if nothing else.

The primary rule is: Divide your money into ten equal parts, and never place
more than one 10-percent portion on a single trade. That helps control your
risk, whether or not you use Gann. (Gann is discussed a little in Chapter 7.)
Kelly Criterion
The Kelly Criterion emerged from statistical work done at Bell Laboratories in
the 1950s. The goal was to figure out the best ways to manage signal-noise
issues in long-distance telephone communications. Very quickly, the mathe-
maticians who worked on it saw that there were applications to gambling,
and in no time, the formula took off.
To calculate the ideal percentage of your portfolio to put at risk, you need 
to know what percentage of your trades are expected to win as well as the
return from a winning trade and the ratio performance of winning trades to
losing trades. The shorthand that many traders use for the Kelly Criterion is
edge divided by odds, and in practice, the formula looks like this:
Kelly % = W – [(1 – W) / R]
W is the percentage of winning trades, and R is the ratio of the average gain
of the winning trades relative to the average loss of the losing trades.
In the beginning of the chapter, I had an example of a system that loses 40
percent of the time with a loss of 1 percent and that wins 60 percent of the
time with a gain of 1.5 percent. Plugging that into the Kelly formula, the right
percentage to trade is .60 – [(1-.60)/(.015/.01)], or 33.3 percent. 
As long as you limit your trades to no more than 33% of your capital, you should
never run out of money. The problem, of course, is that if you have a long
string of losses, you could find yourself with too little money to execute a
trade. Many traders use a “half-Kelly” strategy, limiting each trade to half the
amount indicated by the Kelly Criterion, as a way to keep the trading account
from shrinking too quickly. They are especially likely to do this if the Kelly
Criterion generates a number greater than about 20 percent, as in this example.
Martingale
The martingale style of money management is common with serious casino
gamblers, and many traders apply it as well. It’s designed to improve the
amount of money you can earn in a game that has even odds. Most casino
odds favor the house (roulette wheels used to be evenly black and red, but
casinos found that they could make more money if they inserted a green slice
for zero, thus throwing off the odds). Day trading, on the other hand, is a zero-
sum game, especially in the options and futures markets. This means that for
every winner, there is a loser, so the odds of any one trade being successful
149
Chapter 9: Managing Your Money and Positions

are even. The martingale system is designed to work in any market where the
odds are even or in your favor.
Under the martingale strategy, you start with a set amount per trade, say
$2,000. If your trade succeeds, you trade another $2,000. If your trade loses,
you double your next order (after you close or limit the first trade) so that
you can win back your loss. (You may have heard gamblers talk about dou-
bling down? Well, this is what they are doing.) 
Under the martingale system, you will always come out ahead as long as you
have an infinite amount of money to trade. The problem is that you can run
out of money before you have a trade that works. The market, on the other
hand, has almost infinite resources because of the huge volume of partici-
pants coming and going all over the world. That means that you have an
enormous disadvantage. As long as you have a disadvantage, thoughtful
money management is critical.
Monte Carlo simulation
If you have the programming expertise or buy the right software, you can run
what’s called a Monte Carlo simulation. In this, you enter in your risk and
return parameters and your account value, let the program run, and it
returns the optimal trade size. The system is not perfect — it is only a model
that can’t incorporate every market situation that you’ll face and it has the
fractional trade problem that the other systems do. But it has one big advan-
tage: It can incorporate random changes in the markets in ways that simpler
money management models cannot.
Monte Carlo simulation is not a do-it-yourself project, unless you have exten-
sive experience creating these programs. If you are interested, you need to find
a suitable program. Two options are offered by AnalyCorp, at www.analy
corp.com and Decisioneering, www.decisioneering.com. Others are out
there as well.
Optimal F
The Optimal F system of money management was devised by Ralph Vince, and
he’s written several books about this and other money management issues
(see the Appendix for more information). The idea is that you determine the
ideal fraction of your money to allocate per trade based on past performance.
If your Optimal F is 18 percent, then each trade should be 18 percent of your
account — no more, no less. The system is similar to the fixed fraction and
fixed ratio methods discussed earlier, but with a few differences.
Figure 9-8 shows the equation for finding the number of shares of stock, N, 
to trade.
150
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

F is a factor based on the basis of historical data, and the risk is the biggest
percentage loss that you experienced in the past. Using these numbers and
the current price, you can find the contracts or shares you need to buy. If
your account has $25,000, your biggest loss was 40 percent, your F is deter-
mined to be 30 percent, and you’re looking at a stock trading at $25 per
share, then you should buy 750 shares (Figure 9-9). 
The Optimal F number itself is a mean based on historical trade results. The
risk number is also based on past returns, and that’s one problem with this
method: it only kicks in after you have some trade data. A second problem is
that you need to set up a spreadsheet to calculate it (so read Ralph Vince’s
book if you want to try it out; you can find more information in the Appendix.)
Some traders only use Optimal F in certain market conditions, in part
because the history changes each time a trade is made, and that history
doesn’t always lead to usable numbers.
How Money Management 
Affects Your Return
It’s one thing to describe why you need money management, but it’s more fun
to show you how it works. And because I love making spreadsheets (we all
need a hobby, right?), I pulled one together to show you how different ways
of managing your money might affect your return.

Chapter 9: Managing Your Money and Positions

In Figure 9-2, I started with the expected return assumptions that I used in the
earlier example: 40 percent of the time a trade loses, and it loses 1 percent.
60 percent of the time, the trade wins, and winning trades are up 1.5 percent.
In Figure 9-10, I pick a hypothetical account of $20,000 and set up mock trades
using these expected return numbers. Figure 9-10 compares the performance
of martingale and Kelly money management to betting the whole account
each time.
You may notice in Figure 9-10 that you end up with the most money from trad-
ing the entire account. That doesn’t mean you always get the most money
this way, just that that’s how the numbers worked out in this case, given the
60/40 win ratio and a 3/2 winning size/losing size ratio. (Keep in mind that if
you were using a Kelly or martingale system, you’d probably be doing some-
thing with the rest of the account rather than just letting it sit there.)

How money
management
affects your
return.
152
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

This is just an example, applying some different strategies to different hypo-
thetical returns. I’m not recommending any one system over another. The
best system for you depends on what assets you are trading, your personal
trading style, and how much money you have to trade.
Planning for Your Profits
In addition to determining how much to trade each time you place an order,
you need a plan for what to do with the profits that accumulate in your
account. That’s as much a part of money management as calculating your
probability of ruin and determining trade size. 
Are you going to add the money to your account and trade it as before?
Leverage your profits by trading them more aggressively than your core
account? Pull money out and put it into long-term investments? Or a combi-
nation of the three?
Compounding interest
Compound interest is a simple concept: Every time you get a return, that
return goes into your account. You keep earning a return on it, which increases
your account size some more. You keep earning a return on your return, and
pretty soon, the numbers get to be pretty big.
In order to benefit from that compounding, many traders add their profits
back into their accounts and keep trading them, in order to build account
size. Although day traders earn little to no interest (which is compensation
for loaning out money — say, by buying bonds), the basic principle holds: By
returning profits to the trading account to generate even more profits, the
account should grow over time.
This practice of keeping profits in the account to trade makes a lot of sense
for smaller traders who want to build their accounts and take more signifi-
cant positions over time.
Pyramiding power
Pyramiding involves taking trading profits and borrowing heavily against
them to generate even more profits. Traders usually do this during the day,
using unrealized profits in trades that are not yet closed as collateral for
loans used to establish new positions. If the new positions are profitable, the
trader can keep borrowing until it’s time to close everything at the end of 
the day.
153
Chapter 9: Managing Your Money and Positions

This works great as long as the markets are moving in the right direction. If
all the positions in the pyramid remain profitable, you can make a lot of money
during the course of the day. But if one of those positions turns against you,
the structure collapses and you end up with a call on your margin. Figure 9-11
starts with an initial trade of $2,000 and assumes a return of 10 percent on each
transaction — not realistic, necessarily, but it makes for a nice chart. If the
profits from each trade are used as collateral for borrowing, and if that 10 per-
cent return holds all day, then the trader can make 17 percent by pyramiding
those gains. If a reversal hits before the end of the trading session and the posi-
tions lose 10 percent, then pyramiding magnifies the losses — assuming your
broker would let you keep borrowing. After all, the borrowed money has to be
repaid regardless of what happens in the market.

Part II: Day Trading Tools 

Pyramiding is not related to a pyramid scheme. In trading terms, pyramiding
is a way to borrow against your profits to generate even bigger profits. A
pyramid scheme is a fraud that requires participants to recruit new mem-
bers, and fees paid by the new members go to the older ones. Eventually, the
pyramid collapses because it gets too difficult to recruit new members, and
those at the bottom get nothing.
Some investment frauds have been structured as pyramid schemes, so be
wary of deals that sound fabulous and also require you to recruit others.
Pyramiding increases your trading risk, but also your expected return. It’s a
useful way to grow a portion of your trading account, especially when the
market is favoring your trading system. It’s a good technique for a medium-
sized account that would have enough money left over to stay in the market
if a pyramid were to collapse on you.
Regular withdrawals
Because day trading can be so risky, many traders look to diversify their total
financial risk. One way to do this is to pull money out of the trading account
to put into a less volatile long-term investment. Many traders routinely pull
out a percentage of their profits and put that money into government bonds,
a low-risk mutual fund, or real estate. None of these investments is as glam-
orous or exciting as day trading, but that’s the point: Trading is hard work,
and anyone can lose money any day, no matter how big their account is or
how much money they have made so far. By moving some money out, a
trader can build a cushion for a bad trading stretch, prepare for retirement,
and have some money to walk away for a short period or even forever. That
can greatly reduce the stress and the fear that go with trading.
The larger the account, the easier it is to pull money out, but even smaller
traders should consider taking 5 or 10 percent of each quarter’s profits and
moving them into another type of investment. Many brokerage firms can set
up automatic withdrawal plans that zap money from your trading account to
a stock or bond mutual fund, if you don’t trust yourself to do it.

Taxes for Traders

 Reporting to the IRS and paying estimated taxes
 Day trading and retirement accounts
T
hink day trade returns come without a catch? Think again, because the
IRS has plenty of ways to catch you come April 15. Day trading involves
strategies that generate both high returns and high tax liabilities, which can
eat away at your total return if you are not careful. Not all of your expenses
are deductible, and you might think that you’re day trading, but the IRS will
have a different definition of your activities.
Taxes themselves aren’t necessarily bad, because somehow we have to pay
for things like roads and schools and national defense. But taxes can be dev-
astating to your personal finances if you haven’t planned for them. You need
to consider the tax implications of your trading strategy right from the start
and keep careful records so that you’re ready. 
Tax issues for day traders are complex and change frequently. Check the most
recent federal regulations at www.irs.gov and work with an accountant or
tax expert who has experience in these matters. This chapter is just a guide.
I’m a reasonably social gal and all, but I’m not going on an audit with you. 
Are You a Trader or an Investor?
Back in Chapter 4, I cover the differences between investing, trading, and
gambling. Day traders aren’t investing — they are looking to take advantage
of short-term price movements, not to take a stake in a business for the long

term. Unless, of course, you’re asking the IRS about it. The IRS defines trading
much differently than people in financial circles do. To the taxmen, you are a
trader only if all of the following apply to you:
 You must seek to profit from daily market movements in the prices of
securities, not from dividends, interest, or capital appreciation. 
 Your activity must be substantial; the IRS code does not spell out what
substantial means, but it probably means you’re making at least 3,000
trades per year.
 You must carry on the activity with continuity and regularity. Day trading
is more or less your full-time job, you’ve stuck with it for at least six
months already, and you plan to keep trading into the next year.
If you trade part-time, have other employment, or are new to the day trading
game, the IRS probably won’t let you define yourself as a trader. Don’t care
what an IRS agent calls you, as long she doesn’t call you for an audit? Well,
understanding the difference between trader and investor in IRS lingo is
important to avoid that audit.
Those who qualify as traders enjoy deductions that regular investors don’t. 
You might quality as a trader for some of your activities and as an investor
for others. If this looks to be the case, you need to keep detailed records to
separate your trades, and you should use different brokerage accounts to
make the difference clear from the day you open the position. 
In political economics, taxation serves two purposes. The first is to raise
money for the government. The second is to encourage people to do things
that the elected officials who amend the tax code want them to do. Much of
the investing tax code is intended to promote the formation and growth of
businesses. Short-term day trading doesn’t do that, so the tax law doesn’t
offer short-term investors the same benefits that it gives to long-term
investors and business owners.
Hiring a Tax Adviser
You don’t have to hire someone to do your taxes, but you probably should.
Day trading generates a lot of separate transactions to track, and the tax laws
are tricky. Mistakes can end up costing you your entire trading profit.
Do yourself a favor and find yourself a tax expert. You can talk to other
traders, get references from the attorneys and accountants you work with
now, or even do Internet searches to find people who understand both IRS
regulations and the unique needs of people who frequently buy and sell secu-
rities, whether or not the IRS calls them traders.
158
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

The many flavors of tax experts
Okay, you’re waiting for me to say there’s only one flavor, and it’s vanilla,
right? Wrong. Tax experts fall into several different categories, and knowing
which is which can help you determine who is best for you.
Certified public accountants
A certified public accountant has studied accounting in college and passed
exams that tested her knowledge of a wide range of accounting subjects.
Because much of accounting involves income tax preparation, many CPAs
specialize in this. CPAs generally have the best combined knowledge of tax
laws and tax preparation techniques — but not all of them specialize in or
even understand day trading.
Enrolled agents
Enrolled agents specialize in tax preparation. They receive registration from
the IRS after passing a two-day, eight-hour exam covering only tax topics.
That’s what they know best. They may not be so good at helping you with
other accounting needs, such as preparing payroll for your office assistants.
Tax attorneys
Tax attorneys usually work with CPAs; they are called in to study the legality
of proposed strategies or represent a client in tax litigation. They aren’t
appropriate for most traders, but there may be situations that call for one. 
Storefronts and volunteers: probably not a good idea
Every winter, vacant buildings are turned into tax preparation centers, and
the IRS promotes its cadre of volunteers who help people with their taxes.
These services can be a boon to the average person who lacks the time or
patience to deal with the tax forms. But if you are trader, you’re going to run
into complex problems that most of these services are not prepared to handle. 
Only CPAs, enrolled agents, and tax attorneys are allowed to represent clients
before the IRS in audits, collections, or appeals. Other paid preparers can
represent clients in an audit, but they can’t handle more complex matters. 
Questions to ask a prospective adviser
After you identify a few prospective candidates to prepare your taxes, talk to
them and ask them questions about their experience. You want someone who
understands things such as the wash-sale rule (which can limit the deductibil-
ity of your losses and is covered in more detail below) and the mark-to-market
election (which can allow you to deduct more losses and is also covered in
159
Chapter 10: Taxes for Traders

more detail in this chapter) and who can help you determine what you owe in
taxes and not one penny more. 
You’ll feel more comfortable with your tax preparer if you have an under-
standing of the issues at stake. Even if you are hiring someone — and you
should — keep reading this chapter and check the Appendix for more in-
depth references on taxes and trading.
Here some things you should ask a potential tax preparer:
 What investors and traders have you worked with? For how long?
 Have you worked with traders or investors in my state? Can you prepare
my state return?
 Have you helped traders make the mark-to-market election?
 What is your experience with the wash-sale rule? How will my trading
style be affected by it?
 Who will be preparing my return? How involved will you be?
 Do you offer tax analysis of trading strategies?
 What’s your audit record? Why have your clients been audited? What
happened on the audit?
 What are your fees? 
It is illegal for tax preparers to base their fees on the size of your tax refund,
and it is illegal for them to guarantee you a refund.
You still want to do it yourself?
It’s possible for traders to do their own taxes. If you are comfortable with tax
forms, if you are only day trading a little bit, and if I haven’t deterred you yet,
you might be able to do this yourself. You need a few things: the proper IRS
forms and tax preparation software that can handle investment income.
Everything you want to know about taxes is at www.irs.gov
The IRS Web site, www.irs.gov, is a treasure trove of tax information. All the
regulations, publications, forms, and explanations are there, and some of it is
even in plain English. It’s so vast and detailed that you will probably be over-
whelmed; I’m not sure there is any page in any IRS publication that does not
mention dividends received under the State of Alaska Permanent Fund. 
Curious to know about this State of Alaska Permanent Fund? It’s an annual
payment made to all residents of Alaska every year, based on the profits of 
oil pumped in that state. To put this into context, Alaska had 663,661 resi-
dents in 2005, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. I think there are two
160
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

pages of IRS publications mentioning the fund for every person who gets a
check from it.
The primary publication that covers the tax implications of trading and other
investing activities is Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses. It’s
available at www.irs.gov/publications/p550/.
Tax preparation software
Those who do their own taxes know that tax prep software is a godsend, and
it’s even more valuable for those do-it-yourselfers who trade a lot. The soft-
ware fills out the forms, automatically adds and subtracts, and even catches
typographical errors. In many cases, it can download data straight from your
brokerage account, making data entry really simple.
Most of the big brands, such as TaxCut and TurboTax, publish several editions
each year — not all of which are set up to import and manage lots of trading
data. Among those that have services for investors are TurboTax Premier
Investments (www.turbotax.com), TaxCut Premium (www.taxcut.com),
and CompleteTax (www.completetax.com).
What Is Income, Anyway?
Income seems like a straightforward concept, but not much about taxation is
straightforward. To the IRS, income falls into different categories, with differ-
ent tax rates, different allowed deductions, and different forms to fill out. In
this section I cover income definitions you’ll run into as a day trader.
Earned income
Earned income includes wages, salaries, bonuses, and tips. It’s money that
you make on the job. But even if day trading is your only occupation, your
earnings are not considered to be earned income. This means that day
traders, whether classified for tax purposes as investors or traders, don’t
have to pay the self-employment tax on their trading income. Isn’t that great?
Well, maybe, maybe not. The self-employment tax, the bane of many an inde-
pendent business person, is a contribution to the Social Security fund.
(Employees pay half of the contribution, and the employer pays the other
half. The self-employed have to pay the whole thing.)
The problem is that if you don’t have earned income, you are not paying into
Social Security. If you are not paying into Social Security, you might not be 
eligible to retirement benefits. To collect benefits, you have to have paid in 
40 credits, and you can earn a maximum of four credits per year. Most
161

employees do this easily, but if you have taken time off work or have a long
history of work as an independent investor, you may not have paid enough in.
Any benefits you do collect are based on the 35 years of highest earned
income over your work history. Your years of independent trading show up
as years with zero earned income, and that might hurt your ultimate benefit. 
The Social Security Administration has a handy online calculator, www.social
security.gov/planners/calculators.htm, which can help you deter-
mine whether day trading makes sense for you right now, given the possible
effect on your Social Security benefits. 
Investment income
Investment income is your total income from property held for investment
before any deductions. This includes interest, dividends, annuities, and royal-
ties. It does not include net capital gains, unless you choose to include them.
Do you want to include them? Well, read the next section. 
Other than net capital gains, which you might or might not decided to include,
most day traders have very little investment income for tax purposes. 
Capital gains and losses
A capital gain is the profit you make when you buy low and sell high, and
that’s the aim of day trading. The opposite of a capital gain is a capital loss,
which happens when you sell an asset for less than you paid for it. Investors
can offset some of their capital gains with some of their capital losses to
reduce their tax burden.
Those who trade frequently will have many capital gains and losses, though,
and they may very well run afoul of complicated IRS rules about capital gains
taxation. Day traders get tripped up by capital gain and loss problems all the
time. When designing your trading strategy, think long and hard about how
much pain taxes might cause.
The financial world is filled with horror stories of people who thought they
found a clever angle on making big profits, only to discover at tax time that
their tax liability was greater than their profit. In the real world, taxes matter. 
Capital gains come in two flavors: short term and long term. You’re charged 
a low rate on long-term capital gains, which right now is defined as the gain
on assets held for more than one year. How low? It’s 15 percent right now.
162
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

Short-term capital gains, which are those made on any asset held for one year
or less, are taxed at the ordinary income rate, probably 28 percent or more.
Covering all your basis
Capital gains and losses are calculated using a security’s basis, which may 
or may not be the same as the price that you paid for it or sold it at. Some
expenses, such as commissions or disallowed wash-sale losses (both of
which are discussed later in this chapter), are added to the cost of the secu-
rity, and that can reduce the amount of your taxable gain or increase the
amount of your deductible loss.
For example, if you bought 100 shares of stock at $50 per share and a $0.03
per share commission, your basis would be $5,003 — the $5,000 you paid for
the stock and the $3.00 you paid in commission. 
The wash-sale problem
Let’s say you love LMNO Company, but the price of the shares is down from
what it was when you purchased them. You’d like to get that loss on your
taxes, so you sell the stock, and then you buy it back at the lower price. You
get your tax deduction and still keep the stock. How excellent is that?
It’s too excellent to be true. The IRS does not count the loss. This trick is
called a wash sale. The wash-sale rule was designed to keep long-term
investors from playing cute with their taxes, but it has the effect of creating a
ruinous tax situation for naïve day traders.
Under the wash-sale rule, you cannot deduct a loss if you have both a gain
and a loss in the same security within a 61-day period. (That’s calendar days,
not trading days, so weekends and holidays count.) However, you can add
the disallowed loss to the basis of your security.
Here’s an example to show you what I mean. On Tuesday, you bought 100
shares of LMNO at $34.60. LMNO announced terrible earnings, and the stock
promptly dropped to $29.32, and you sold all 100 shares for a loss of $528.
Later in the afternoon, you noticed that the stock had bottomed and looked
like it might trend up, so you bought another 100 shares at $28.75 and resold
them an hour later at $29.25, closing out your position for the day. The second
trade had a profit of $50. You had a net loss of $478 (the $528 loss plus the $50
profit), but the IRS will disallow the $528 loss and let you show only a profit of
$50. However, the IRS will let you add the $528 loss to the basis of your replace-
ment shares, meaning that instead of spending $2,875 (100 shares times $28.75),
for tax purposes, you spent $3,403 ($2,875 plus $528), which means that the
second trade caused you to lose the $478 that you added back. On a net basis,
you get to record your loss. The basis addition lets you work off your wash-sale
163
Chapter 10: Taxes for Traders

losses, eventually, assuming that you keep careful records and have more win-
ning trades than losing ones in any one security.
To make the calculations easier, several different tax software packages can
download trade data from your brokerage account to keep track of your tax
situation. One to check out is TradeLog, www.armencomp.com/tradelog/.
Even if you hire someone to do your taxes, tracking your potential liabilities
as you trade can help you avoid costly mistakes.
The wash-sale rule applies to substantially similar securities. LMNO stock
and LMNO options are considered to be substantially similar, so you can’t get
around the rule by varying securities on the same underlying asset. LMNO
shares and shares of its closest competitor, PQRS, would probably not be
considered to be substantially similar, so you can trade within a given indus-
try to help avoid wash-sale problems.
At an extreme, the wash-sale rule can mean that traders who are in and out of
the same securities over and over may be taxed on all their winning trades,
without being able to subtract their losing trades for tax purposes. If your
winning trades gained $300,000, and your losing trades cost you $200,000,
you cleared $100,000 — but the IRS might tax you on the $300,000. Ouch!
There are ways around the wash-sale rule. The obvious solution is to qualify
as a trader for IRS purposes and then take the mark-to-market accounting
election (I cover the benefits of that later in this chapter). Other methods for
avoiding the wash-sale rule include trading a given security only once every
60 calendar days and doing all your trading within a qualified retirement
account such as an IRA (also discussed later in this chapter). Some securities
are handled differently. Futures contracts are considered to generate invest-
ment income and losses, not capital gains. Profits on options contracts are 60
percent long-term capital gains and 40 percent short-term capital gains,
which reduces the wash-sale rule effect. Some traders prefer to work with
options and futures simply because it makes tax time easier. 
If you have any more clever ideas, be sure to run them through an experi-
enced tax pro first.
Tracking Your Investment Expenses
Day traders have expenses. They buy computer equipment, subscribe to
research services, pay trading commissions, and hire accountants to prepare
their taxes. It adds up, and the tax code recognizes that. That’s why day
traders can deduct many of their costs from their income taxes. In this sec-
tion, I go through some of what you can deduct.
164
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

You’ll make your life much easier if you keep track of your expenses as you
incur them. You can do this in a notebook, in a spreadsheet, or through per-
sonal finance software such as Quicken or Microsoft Money.
Qualified and deductible expenses
You can deduct investment expenses as miscellaneous itemized deductions
on Schedule A of Form 1040 as long as they are considered to be ordinary,
necessary, and used to produce or collect income, manage property held for
producing income, and directly related to the taxable income produced. 
Clerical, legal, and accounting fees 
You might use the services of a lawyer to help you get set up, and you will
almost definitely want to use an accountant who understands investment
expenses to help you evaluate your trading strategy and prepare your state
and federal income tax returns each year. There’s good news here: You can
deduct attorney and accounting fees related to your investment income. If
your trading operation gets big enough that you hire clerical help to keep
track of all those trade confirmations, you can deduct that cost, too.
Office expenses
If you do your day trading from an outside office, you can deduct the rent and
related expenses. You can deduct the expenses of a home office, too, as long
as you use it regularly and exclusively for business. If your trading room is
also the guest room, it doesn’t count.
Whether or not you deduct your office, you can deduct certain office
expenses for equipment and supplies used in your business. You can usually
write off roughly $100,000 in computers, desks, chairs, and the like if you use
them for trading more than half of the time. (The limits change every year.) 
To get the deduction, you have to spend the money first, and your expenses
don’t reduce your taxes dollar-for-dollar. If you are in the 28-percent tax
bracket, then each dollar you spend on qualified expenses reduces your
taxes by $0.28. In other words, don’t go crazy at the office supply store just
because you get a tax deduction. It may be helpful to think of deductible
expenses as discounts, because in the end that’s more or less what they are.
Investment counsel and advice 
The IRS allows you to deduct fees paid for counsel and advice about invest-
ments that produce taxable income. This includes books, magazines, news-
papers, and research services that help you refine your trading strategy. It
165
Chapter 10: Taxes for Traders

also includes anything you might pay for investment advisory services, such
as trade coaching or analysis. 
Safe deposit box rent
Have a safety box down at the bank? You can deduct the rent on it if you
store any investment-related documents. If you also keep jewelry that you
inherited and never wear or other personal items in the same box, you can
only deduct part of the rent. 
Investment interest
If you borrow money as part of your strategy, and most day traders do, you
can deduct the interest paid on those loans as long as it is not from a home
mortgage (because that interest is already deductible) and as long as you are
not subject to other limitations. There’s always a catch, isn’t there? In most
cases, this is margin interest (see Chapter 8 for more information on margin),
and for most day traders, it is relatively small because few day traders
borrow money for more than a few hours at a time.
If you borrow money against your account for anything other than investing
or trading, you can’t deduct the interest. And yes, most brokerage firms let
you take out margin for your own general spending, as a way to let you stay
in the market and still get cash. 
State income taxes
If you itemize your deductions, you can deduct, as taxes, state income taxes
on interest income that is exempt from federal income tax. But you cannot
deduct, as either taxes or investment expenses, state income taxes on other
exempt income. In most cases, exempt income is related to government bond
transactions, and few day traders will work in those markets.
The 50 states all have different rules about taxation of investment income.
Some states with little or no income tax handle investments differently. Because
there are so many different issues, state taxation is beyond the scope of this
book. Check with your state revenue department and a state-savvy tax expert
to see what you need to know where you live.
What you can’t deduct
While day trading, you will probably incur expenses that can’t be deducted
from your taxes. It’s disappointing, but at least if you know what they are
upfront, you can plan accordingly.
166
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

What? I can’t deduct commissions?
Every time you make a trade, you have to pay a commission to your broker. It
may be small, just a few cents per share or a few dollars per trade, but you
have to pay it. And you can’t deduct that cost.
Before you splutter in outrage, read this: You can’t deduct it, but you can add
it to cost and subtract it from the proceeds of your trade. 
Here’s an example: You buy 100 shares of Microsoft at $29.40 per share,
paying a $6.00 commission on the trade. Your total cost for IRS purposes is
($29.40 × 100) + $6.00, which equals $2,946. Later in the day, you sell all 100
shares for $29.50 per share at a $6.00 commission, so your total proceeds for
the deal are ($29.50 × 100) – $6.00, or $2,950. Your total profit for tax pur-
poses is $2,950 – $2946, or $4.00.
Including the commission in the basis of your trade works like a deduction in
terms of the amount of tax you pay, but it’s better for you that it’s not a
deduction because it’s not subject to the limitations that affect the
deductibility of other expenses. 
If your state charges transfer taxes on securities, they are handled the same
way as commissions.
Attending stockholders’ meetings
Companies hold annual meetings for their shareholders each year, usually at or
near the company headquarters. Sometimes they are deathly dull — the board
of directors sits around a conference room in a law office and goes through a
boilerplate agenda with nothing to discuss. Others are extravaganzas where
the company shows off new products, showcases major accomplishments, and
takes questions from anyone in attendance. And a few involve contentious
issues that can lead to protests and fighting, which is entertaining to watch if
you aren’t directly affected. (You can see a fun example in Michael Moore’s
1989 documentary Roger and Me, in which Moore tries to talk to Roger Smith,
then the Chairman of General Motors, at the company’s annual meeting.)
For long-term investors, these meetings can offer valuable insights on a com-
pany’s prospects. Day traders probably wouldn’t find them very useful, and
it’s just as well, because the IRS won’t let anyone deduct the costs of trans-
portation, hotel stays, meals, and other expenses that might be involved in
attending a stockholders’ meeting. 
Attending investment seminars
The financial services industry offers all kinds of conventions, cruises, and sem-
inars for day traders. You could spend your days attending training seminars
167
Chapter 10: Taxes for Traders

instead of actually trading, if you were so inclined. You’re welcome to go to
these, and in many cases, you should. You might learn things that would help
you trade more effectively. However, you can’t deduct the costs. Bummer. 
There’s some gray area here. You can’t deduct the costs of attending semi-
nars, but you can deduct the costs of investment counsel and advisory ser-
vices. Some seminars might qualify as investment advice. This is why you
need an experienced tax adviser to help you out.
Did you notice that two of the nondeductible expense categories have the
potential to involve travel? The IRS does not want people buying ten shares
of Hawaiian Electric Industries stock and then trying to write off a trip to the
company’s annual meeting in Honolulu, nor do they consider cruises that
happen to include a talk by the author of a book on investing to be bona fide
investment counsel. They see these activities as vacations, and vacations are
not tax deductible.
(Of course, if an author of an investment book happened to be on such a
cruise, that might be a deductible cost for book promotion. Most likely. Um,
not like I know any authors of investment books who might have looked into
this or anything.)
Naturally, there are limitations!
You didn’t think the IRS would let you take all your deductions automatically,
did you? Of course not. Your deductions might be limited, especially if you do
not meet the IRS definition of trader.
At-risk rules
The IRS says that your loss is limited by the amount of property you con-
tribute to your investing activities, including money you borrow. In most
cases, day trading losses meet the risk definitions, but if you pursue a naked
trading strategy that causes you to lose more than your initial investment,
you might fall into this category. 
Passive activity losses and credits
The IRS defines a passive activity as an investment where the investor does
not play an active role but does make money. You can deduct passive activity
losses only up to the amount of your passive activity income, and you can
use credits from passive activity losses only against tax on the income from
passive activities. Day trading is generally considered to be active, because
168
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

you are materially participating, but if you are generating passive losses from
other investment activities, you probably won’t be able to use them to offset
your day trading gains.
Interest expense limitations
The IRS allows you to deduct investment interest up to the amount of your
net investment income, which is your investment income less all your allow-
able deductible expenses except for interest. If you lost money trading, you
can’t use the interest deduction to reduce your taxes. What you can do,
though, is carry the undeducted investment interest into next year, and use it
to reduce your taxes on those profits. 
You also can’t deduct interest expenses on straddles. A straddle is an options
strategy that involves buying both a put option and a call option on the same
stock with the same strike price and expiration date. In most cases, the non-
deductible interest and related carrying charges are added to the basis of the
straddle (just as commissions are — see earlier in this chapter). 
Two-percent limit
If you do not qualify as a trader to the IRS, then you can only deduct invest-
ment expenses and other miscellaneous itemized deductions if they add up
to more than 2 percent of your adjusted gross income. 
Top Secret Tax Information for 
IRS-Qualified Traders Only
If you meet the IRS qualifications for being a trader, covered earlier, then 
you can avoid some of the tax headaches faced by people who trade but are
not considered by the taxman to be traders. If you trade as your job, make
thousands of trades a year, and rarely hold any position for more than a day,
then you can fill out something called Form 3115, Application for Change in
Accounting Method, and tell the IRS that you want to use the mark-to-market
election in calculating your capital gains and losses. This is not an easy form
to fill out, so you should have a professional do it for you.
The form has to be submitted with your prior year’s tax return. If you want to
use mark-to-market accounting in 2008, for example, you need to submit
Form 3115 when you send in your 2007 tax return in April of 2008.
169
Chapter 10: Taxes for Traders

Notice that you can’t use the election in your first year of trading. You first
have to prove that you are a trader before you are allowed to get the tax ben-
efits that go with the title. Consider it an apprenticeship.
If you qualify for trader status, you receive two benefits:
 Mark-to-market accounting
 Increased expense deductions
Mark-to-market accounting
Under mark-to-market accounting, you no longer have to track capital gains.
Instead, you pretend to sell your portfolio at the end of the year and then pre-
tend to repurchase everything at the beginning of the new year so that all
capital gains fall into income.
Because day traders usually close all their positions at the end of the day
anyway, mark-to-market accounting may not seem like a big deal, but it is: In
effect, converting all capital gains to income means that your trades are no
longer subject to the wash-sale rule. For most day traders, this means lower
taxes and fewer paperwork hassles. 
If you use mark-to-market accounting, you can no longer get the 15-percent
rate on any long-term capital gains from your trading activities. Unless a day
trader is working with listed options, which are considered to show profits
that are 60-percent long-term capital gains and 40-percent short-term capital
gains, there may not be any long-term capital gains from trading activities.
Greater deductibility of business expenses
In general, the IRS only allows investors to deduct business expenses if they
exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income. However, anyone who gets to join
the charmed circle of IRS-qualified traders gets to deduct 100 percent of
expenses, regardless of their adjusted gross income. They get to deduct all
their investment interest, too.
One caveat, though — the IRS assumes that people are in the business of
trading because they are making money at it. If you lose money for three out
of five years, even if it’s because your expenses exceeded your investment
profits, the IRS will probably kick you out of the club.
170
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

Reporting Your Investment Expenses
Many of the differences in income and expenses discussed already in this
chapter make more sense when you think about how they are reported on
your income tax return. In this section, I give you the highlights of some of
the most exciting forms for the modern day trader. Note that they are differ-
ent for those who qualify as traders than for everyone else who day trades.
Forms for qualified traders
If you make the mark-to-market election on Form 3115, you’re considered to
be in the business of trading. Business expenses for individual tax filers are
put on Schedule C of Form 1040, Profit or Loss from Business. Then your trad-
ing gains and losses are recorded on Part II of Form 4797. If you have any
securities at the end of the year in your trading account, pretend that they
were sold on the last business day of the year at current fair market value
and then immediately reacquired. 
Forms for everyone else
Day traders who are not considered traders by the IRS should itemize busi-
ness deductions and investment interest expenses on Schedule A of Form
1040. You should attach Form 4952 if you used that to figure your investment
interest expense. Capital gains and losses from your trading are reported on
Schedule D of Form 1040, subject to all the limits on losses. 
Paying Taxes All Year
If you have been an employee for years and years, all of your tax liabilities
may have been covered by your payroll tax deductions. The IRS likes it best
that way, because then it gets money all year ‘round. Let’s face it — the easier
it is to pay, the more likely you are to do it.
People who are self-employed or who have significant earnings from invest-
ments and day trading may generate more income than can be covered from
payroll withholding. What you need to do is estimate your tax liability four
times a year and then write a check for those amounts. (Otherwise, you
171
Chapter 10: Taxes for Traders

could face a penalty at tax time.) Estimated taxes are paid on Form 1040 ES
and are due on April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15. 
Estimated taxes are not due on a nice, even, quarterly schedule. No, it’s a
payment schedule that only a bureaucrat could love. 
Using Self-Directed Individual
Retirement Accounts
Much of the tax hassle associated with day trading is eliminated if you trade
through a self-directed Individual Retirement Arrangement, or IRA. Most bro-
kerage firms can set them up for you and handle the necessary paperwork.
Although individuals can contribute only $4,000 per year ($5,000 for people
older than 50), the money can be substantial for those who have been con-
tributing for a long time. Also, you can roll over money from an employer’s
retirement plan, such as a 401(k), into an IRA after you leave.
You don’t have to pay taxes in an IRA until you retire, and then withdrawals
are generally treated as ordinary income. This makes them a great vehicle for
day traders: You can post big gains, count all your losses, and avoid wash-
sale rules for trading within your IRA. It’s a sweet way to let your profits accu-
mulate and compound for years. Of course, there’s a catch: You can’t sell
short, you can’t use all options strategies, and your brokerage firm may not
want to clear funds through the IRA.
Keep in mind, though, that you can’t withdraw money from an IRA account
until you turn 591⁄2. If you take money out earlier, you’ll pay a 10-percent tax
penalty, and that offsets a lot of the advantages. If you’ll need income from
your trading activities to cover your living expenses before then, an IRA is
probably not the best way to set up your day trading account.

Chapter 11
But Did You Make Money?
Evaluating Performance
In This Chapter 
 Testing before you trade
 Tracking while you trade
 Evaluating performance after the trade
A
ny one trade involves a lot of variables: price bought, price sold, com-
missions charged, volume traded, and amount of leverage used. And
each of these affects your overall performance. In the heat of a trading day, it
can be hard to juggle all these factors and determine just how well you did or
did not do. 
Performance calculation starts before you trade. You want to test your strate-
gies and see if they work for you, which requires backtesting and paper trad-
ing. You want to keep track of your trades in real time with the help of a
trading diary. And then, on a periodic basis (at least monthly), you should
review your progress to see how much money you are making and whether
you need to change your strategy.
Before You Trade: Testing Your System
Performance measurement starts before the trading does. That’s because
you want to figure out how you will trade before you start betting real money.
Chapter 3 describes some of the different securities that can be traded on a
daily basis, whereas Chapters 12–15 cover some of the strategies that day
traders use. After you figure out the combinations of securities and strategies
you want to use, you’ll want to see whether they would have made you money
in the past. Then you should try them out to see if they still work now. 

The happy news? All this is possible without risking a dime, except of course
for the money you might spend on backtesting and simulation software. You
knew there had to be a catch, right? Consider it an investment in the success
of your business.
Backtesting
In backtesting, a trader specifies the strategy that he or she would use and
then runs it through a database of historic securities prices to see whether
the strategy would have made money. The test includes assumptions about
commissions, leverage, and position size. The results give information on
returns, volatility, and win-loss ratios that can be used to refine a trading
strategy and implement it well.
Starting with a hypothesis
What trades do you want to do? After you figure out what and how to trade,
you can start setting forth what your strategy will be. Will you look for high-
momentum, small-cap stocks? Seek out price changes related to news events
in agricultural commodities? Ride large-cap stocks within their ranges?
Arbitrage stock index futures and their options?
Once you have done your research, you can lay out your strategy as a hypoth-
esis. It might be something like this: “High-momentum, small-cap stocks tend
to close up for the day, so you can buy them in the morning and make money
selling them in the afternoon.” Or: “News events take at least half an hour to
affect pork belly prices, so you can buy or sell on the news and make a profit.”
With this statement, you can move on to the test to see if it holds. 
One of the most valuable parts about backtesting is that you have to be very
specific about what your trading rule is. Computers cannot understand vague
instructions, and if you find that your trading strategy is too complicated to
write out and set into a backtesting program, it’s probably too complicated
for you to follow.
Running the test
Let’s say you start with something simple: Maybe you have reason to think
that pharmaceutical companies that are moving down in price on decreasing
volume will turn and close up for the day. The first thing you do is enter that
into the software: the industry group and the buy pattern that you’re looking
for. The results will show whether your hunch is correct, and how often and
for what time periods.
If you like what you see, you can add more variables. What happens if you
add leverage (use borrowed money) in your trades? That increases your risk
of loss, but it also increases your potential return. How does that affect your
174
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

trade? Suppose you increase the size of your trades. Would that help you
make more money or less? By playing around with the system, you can get a
good sense of the best way to make money with your trade ideas. You can
also get a sense of when your rule won’t work, to help you avoid problems.
Most backtesting software allows for optimization, which means that it can
come up with the leverage, position, holding period, and other parameters
that will generate the best risk-adjusted return. You can then compare this to
your trading style and your capital position to see if it works.
Backtesting is subject to something that traders call over-optimization, math-
ematicians call curve-fitting, and analysts call data mining. This means that the
person performing the test looks at a past time where the market performed
well, then identifies all the variables and specifications that generated that
performance. Although it sounds great, what often happens is that the test
generates a model that includes unnecessary variables and that makes no
logical sense in practice. If you find a strategy that works when the stock
closes up one day, down two days, then up a third day, followed by four down
days when it hits an intra-day high, you probably haven’t made an amazing
discovery — you’ve just fit the curve.
People with iPods and MP3 players have elaborate ideas of how the
machines’ “random shuffle” feature works. Ask, and they’ll give you their own
elaborate theory for how certain types of songs show up more often than
others, how songs with similar titles seem to be played together, and other
patterns that they are sure must be there. Why? Because human beings have
evolved to see patterns, even when none is there. It’s the same with the
market. It’s entirely possible that although the results of your test look great,
but they only show a random event that happened to work out once. That’s
why you need to keep testing, even after you start trading. 
Comparing the results with market cycles
The markets change every day in response to new regulations, interest rate
fluctuations, economic conditions, nasty world events, and run-of-the-mill
news events. (It’s like the joke about weather: If you don’t like it now, wait a
minute, and it will change.) Different securities and strategies do better in
some market climates than in others. 
When you are backtesting, it’s important to do it over enough time so that
you can see how your strategy would work over different market conditions.
Here are some things to check:
 How did the strategy do in periods of inflation? Economic growth? High
interest rates? Low interest rates?
 What was happening in the markets during the time that the strategy
worked best? What was happening when it worked worst? How likely is
either of those to happen again?
175
Chapter 11: But Did You Make Money? Evaluating Performance

 How does market volatility affect the strategy? Is the security more
volatile than the market, less volatile, or does it seem to be removed
from the market?
 Have there been major changes in the industry over the period of the
test? Does this mean that past performance still applies?
 Have there been changes in the way that the security trades? For exam-
ple, the bulk of trading in most commodities used to take place in open-
outcry trading pits. Now, it’s mostly electronic. Does that change affect
your test results?
In the Capital Assets Pricing Model, which is a key part of academic finance
theory, the market risk is known as beta. The value that a portfolio manager
adds to investment performance is known as alpha. In the long run, conven-
tional finance theory says that the return on a diversified portfolio comes
from beta; alpha does not exist. In the short run, where day traders play, this
relationship might not be so strong.
Past performance is not indicative of future results. A strategy may test per-
fectly, but that doesn’t mean it will continue to work. Backtesting is an impor-
tant step to successful day trading, but it is only one step.
Simulation trading
With a backtested strategy in hand, you might be tempted to start putting
real money on the line. Don’t, just yet. Start with what is known variously as
ghost trading, paper trading, and simulation trading. Sit down in front of your
computer screen and start watching the price quotes. When you see your
ideal entry point, write it down. When you see your exit point, write it down.
Do exactly what you plan to do with real money, just don’t use the money.
Then, figure out what your performance would have been.
If your strategy does not generate a lot of trades, you can probably keep track
with a pen and paper and then enter the data into a spreadsheet to calculate
the effects of commissions and leverage and to analyze the performance on
both a percentage and a win-loss basis. For more complex strategies that
involve a large number of trades on a large number of securities, you might
want to use simulation software. These are trading simulation software pack-
ages that mimic trading software (and are usually added features to trading
software packages; see Chapters 6 and 7 for more information). They let you
enter the size of your order, let you use leverage, and tell you whether your
trade can be executed given current market conditions. 
Markets are affected by supply and demand, and your trade can affect that.
And that’s the biggest drawback of simulation trading: It’s difficult to take the
market effects of your trade into account in any reliable way.
176
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

The results of your trading simulation can help you refine your trading strat-
egy further. Does it work in current market conditions? Are you able to iden-
tify entry and exit points? Can you make enough trades to make money to
make your day trading efforts worth while? Do you want to refine your strat-
egy some more, or are you ready to go with it?
It may take a long time to find a suitable strategy. Some traders report spend-
ing months finding a strategy they felt comfortable using. Day trading is a
business like any other. Consider this part of the market research and educa-
tion process that you need to go through, just as you would have to spend
time doing research before opening a store or training for a new career. Stay
patient. It’s better to do good simulation for months than to lose thousands
of real dollars in hours.
Backtesting and simulation software 
Several vendors have risen to meet the challenge of backtesting. The list in
this section is by no means exhaustive, nor is it an endorsement of their ser-
vices. It’s just a good place for you to start your research.
If you are just getting started with trading, you may want to work with a
cheaper package just to see how it works. If you already have an account
with a brokerage firm, check to see if backtesting and simulation are among
the services offered. You can always move up as your needs change or if you
start pursing exotic strategies with unusual securities.
AmiBroker
AmiBroker (www.amibroker.com) offers a robust backtesting service at a
relatively low price. This makes it a popular choice with people who are get-
ting started in day trading and who don’t have more expensive services. It
also allows users to make sophisticated technical charts that they can use to
monitor the markets. One drawback is that you might have to pay extra for
the market price quote data, depending on what securities and time periods
you want to test. 
Cybertrader
Cybertrader (www.cybertrader.com) is Charles Schwab’s product for active
traders. Its Strategy Tester feature lets you test your trading idea. Then you
can set it into a Strategy Ticker that follows your strategy while the market is
open, so that you can see how it performs in real time. This isn’t quite the
same as paper trading, as it isn’t testing how well you would pull the trigger,
although presumably you would buy or sell whenever your system told you
to — right?
177
Chapter 11: But Did You Make Money? Evaluating Performance

Tradecision
Tradecision’s (www.tradecision.com) trade analysis software package is a
little pricier than most retail trading alternatives, but it offers more advanced
capabilities, including an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of differ-
ent trading rules. It can incorporate advanced money management techniques
and artificial intelligence to develop more predictions about performance in
different market conditions. The system may be overkill for most new day
traders, but it could come in handy for some. 
TradeStation
TradeStation (www.tradestation.com) is an online broker that specializes
in services for day traders. Its strategy testing service lets you specify differ-
ent trading parameters and then it shows you where these trades would have
taken place in the past using price charts. That way, you can see what would
have happened, which is helpful if you are good at technical analysis. It also
generates a report of the strategy, showing dollar, percentage, and win-loss
performance over different time periods. It does not have a trade simulation
feature.
If you have the programming expertise, or if your strategy is not well repre-
sented in current backtesting programs, you might want to create your own
system. Many software-savvy day traders write programs using Excel’s Visual
Basic functions, allowing them to create custom tests that they then run
against price databases.
During the Day: Tracking Your Trades
Once you put your strategy to work during the trading day, it’s easy to let the
energy and emotion overtake you. You get sloppy and you stop keeping track
of what’s happening. And that’s not good. Day trading is not a video game, it’s
a job. Keeping careful records helps you identify how well you follow your
strategy and helps you identify ways to refine it. It can also show you how
successful your trading is, and it makes your life a lot easier when it’s time to
do your taxes. (You can see Chapter 10 for more information on what the
friendly folks at the IRS expect from traders, besides a cut of their profits.)
Setting up your spreadsheet
The easiest way to get started is with a spreadsheet software program such as
Microsoft Excel. Set up columns for the asset being purchased, the time of the
trade, the price, the quantity purchased, and the commission. Then set up sim-
ilar columns to show what happens when the position is closed out. Finally,
178
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

calculate your performance based on the change in the security’s price and the
dollars and percentage return on your trade. Figure 11-1 gives you an example.
Some brokerage firms and trading platforms automatically store your trade
data for analysis. You can then download the data into your own spreadsheet
or work with it in your trading software. If you make too many trades to keep
track of manually, then this feature will be especially important to you.
Profit and loss statement
If you look at the bottom of Figure 11-1, you’ll see some quick summary statis-
tics on how the day’s trading went: trading profits net of commissions, trad-
ing profits as a percentage of trading capital, and the ratio of winning to losing
transactions. This information should be transferred into another spreadsheet
so that you can track your ongoing success.
Figure 11-2 shows an example of a profit and loss spreadsheet.
Calculate your hourly wage for each day that you trade. Simply take each day’s
profit and divide it by the number of hours that you worked. That number,
more than any other, will help you see whether it makes sense for you to
keep trading or if you’d be better off pursuing a different line of work.If you
find that calculating the number daily is too stressful, try doing it monthly.
The trading diary
As part of your trading spreadsheet, or in addition to it, you should track the
reasons for making every trade. Was it because of a signal from your system?

Chapter 11: But Did You Make Money? Evaluating Performance

Because of a hunch? Because you saw an opportunity that was too good to
pass up? Then you can keep track of how the trade worked out. Is your trad-
ing system giving off good signals? Are you following them? Are your hunches
so good that maybe your system needs to be refined? Are you missing good
trades because you are following your gut and not the data in front of you?
A trading diary gives you information to systematically assess your trading.
Start by writing down why you are making a particular trade and do it when
you make the trade. Trust me, if you wait until later, you’ll forget and you’ll
change your logic to suit your needs. You can enter the information in a
spreadsheet, jot something quick on a piece of scratch paper, or keep a note-
book dedicated to your trading. It doesn’t have to be fancy, as long as you
take the time to make the notes so that you can refer back to it. 
Some traders create a form, make copies of it, and keep a stack of them on
hand so that they can fill them out easily during the day. They even create
predetermined indicators that match their strategies and that they can check
off or circle. At the end of the day, they collect their diary sheets into a three-
ring binder in order to refer back to the data when it’s time to evaluate their
trading strategy and their performance against it.

own trading strategy, including those indicators that matter most to you.
The trading diary form in Figure 11-3 is just an example. If your trading style
is so fast that you don’t have time to fill it out, don’t fret — come up with
some kind of shorthand so that you can keep a running tally of trades made
based on a signal from your system, trades based on your own hunches, and
trades based on other interpretations of market conditions. Then match your
notes against the trader confirmations from your broker to see how you did.

Chapter 11: But Did You Make Money? Evaluating Performance

After You Trade: Calculating 
Overall Performance
Calculating performance seems easy: Simply use the balance at the end of the
year and the balance at the start of the year to find the percentage change.
But what if you added to your investment in the middle of the year? What if
you took cash out in the middle of the year to buy a new computer? Quickly
you’re left with algebra unlike any you’ve seen since high school, but you
need to solve it to see how you are doing.
In addition to the increase in your assets, you want to track your volatility,
which is how much your gains and losses can fluctuate. It’s an important
measure of risk, especially if your trading strategy relies on leverage (see
Chapter 14 for more information on that).
Types of return
The investment performance calculation starts by dividing returns into differ-
ent categories: income, short-term capital gains, and long-term capital gains.
Although almost all a day trader’s gains will come from short-term capital
gains, I go over the definitions of each so that you know the differences. 
Income
When investors talk about income returns, they mean regular payments from
their investments, usually in the form of dividends from stock or interest pay-
ments on bonds. As a day trader, you may earn income on the cash balance
in your brokerage account, but probably not from your trading activities.
Capital gains
A capital gain is the price appreciation in an asset — a stock, a bond, a house,
whatever it is that you’re investing in. You buy it at one price, sell it at another,
and the difference is a capital gain. (Unless, of course, you sell the asset for
less than you paid, and then you have a capital loss.)
For tax purposes, capital gains are classified as either long-term or short-term.
Under the current tax law, any capital gain on an asset held for less than one
year is considered to be a short-term gain, and if the asset is owned for one
year or more before it’s sold, then it’s considered to be a long-term capital
gain. The difference isn’t semantic — long-term capital gains are taxed at lower
rates than short-term capital gains. You can read all about it Chapter 10.
182
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

Income in tax terms is different from income in financial terms. Much of what
an investor would consider to be a capital gain, such as the short-term capi-
tal gains that day traders generate, the IRS considers to be income.
Calculating returns
Give someone with a numerical bent a list of numbers and a calculator, and
she can some up with several different relationships between the numbers.
Once the asset values for each time period have been determined, rates of
return can be calculated. But how? And over how long a time period? The
process gets a little more complicated.
Percentage change
The most common way to calculate investment returns is to use a time-
weighted average. It’s perfect for traders who start with one pool of money
and do not add to it or take money out. This is also called the Compound
Average Rate of Return (CAGR). If you are looking at only one month or one
year, it’s a simple percentage, as shown in Figure 11-4.
EOY stands for end of year asset value and BOY is beginning of year value. The
result is the percentage return for one year, and it’s simple arithmetic.
Now, if you want to look at your return over a period of several years, you
need to look at the compound return rather than the simple return for each
year. The compound return shows you how your investment is growing. You
are getting returns on top of returns, and that is a good thing. But the math
gets a little complicated, because now you have to use the root function on
your calculator. The equation looks like Figure 11-5.
EOP stands for end of the total time period, BOP stands for beginning of the
total time period, and that N is the number of years that we’re looking at.

Chapter 11: But Did You Make Money? Evaluating Performance

The basic percentage rate of return is great; it’s an accurate, intuitive mea-
sure of how much gain you’re generating from your trading activities. As long
as you don’t take any money out of your trading account or put any money
into it, you’re set. 
However, you may be putting money into your account. Maybe you have a
salaried job and are day trading on the side, or maybe your spouse gives you
a percentage of his income to add to your trading account. You might also be
taking money out of your day trading account to cover your living expenses
or to put into other investment opportunities. All that money flowing into
and out of your account can really screw up your performance calculation.
You need a way to calculate the performance of your trading system without
considering the deposits and withdrawals to your trading account. 
Here’s an example: You start day trading on January 1 with $100,000 in your
account. On May 1, your income tax refund from last year arrives, and you
add $1,000 of the money to your account and start trading with it. On
December 1, you take out $5,000 to buy holiday presents. At the end of the
year, your account is worth $115,000. How did you do? 
As a day trader, you have a few methods at your disposal for calculating your
performance when you make withdrawals and deposits:
 The Modified Dietz method loses a little accuracy but makes up for it
with simplicity.
 The time-weighted rate of return isolates investment and trading per-
formance from the rest of the account.
 The dollar-weighted rate of return has many flaws but gives a sense of
what the account holder has.
Read on to see the return that would be calculated using each of these methods.
Modified Dietz method
The Modified Dietz method is related to the simple percent change formula,
but it adjusts the beginning and ending period amounts for the cash inflows
and cash outflows. The equation is shown in Figure 11-6.
BOP
EOP

Figure 11-5:
Here’s the
equation for
compound
annual
growth rate.
184
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

So with the numbers in our example, it would look like Figure 11-7.
And that equals 19.8 percent. 
The advantage of the Modified Dietz method is that it so easy to do. You can
calculate it to give you a rough idea of how you are doing with your trading
when you don’t have the time to run a more detailed analysis. The key disad-
vantage is that it doesn’t consider the timing of the deposits and withdrawals.
It would generate the same answer if you took out $5,000 in May and put in
$1,000 in December, even though the amount of money you would have to
trade between May 1 and December 1 would be very different.
Time-weighted rate of return
The time-weighted rate of return shows the investment performance as a per-
centage of the assets at hand to trade. It’s the standard of trader evaluation,
but the math is much more complicated than with the basic percentage change
or the Modified Dietz method. You need to calculate the CAGR for each time
period and then do a second calculation to incorporate each of those over a
longer period. Using our example, you’d calculate one return for the first four
months of the year, another for the next seven months, and then a third return
for the month of December. These three returns would be then be multiplied
to generate a return for the year.
The general equation looks like Figure 11-8.

Chapter 11: But Did You Make Money? Evaluating Performance

N is the total number of time periods that you are looking at, and rpn is the
return for that particular time period. To make it easy, you can do the calcula-
tion in a spreadsheet. Figure 11-9 shows the time-weighted return for this
example.
The result is 18.78 percent, a little below the Modified Dietz return.
If you plan on adding to or taking money out of your account, you can make
your return calculations much easier by setting a regular schedule and stick-
ing to it. Otherwise, you’ll have to do calculations for fractional time periods.
It’s not impossible, but it’s kind of a hassle.
The time-weighted rate of return gives you the best sense of your trading per-
formance, and its precision for this use more than offsets the complexity of
the calculation. You want to look at this number when you are deciding
whether to change or refine your strategy.
Dollar-weighted returns
The dollar-weighted return, also called the money-weighted return, is the rate
that makes the net present value of a stream of numbers equal to zero. That
calculation is also called the internal rate of return or IRR, and it is used for

other things than just return calculations. It’s a way of determining what the
return is for a stream of numbers over time, and it’s useful for calculating
returns when you’re putting money into or taking money out of your trading
account. And if you have a financial calculator such as the Hewlett-Packard
HP12C or the Texas Instruments BA2+, it’s pretty easy to calculate.
Ah, but there’s a catch! Although it’s useful, the dollar-weighted method can
misstate returns and can occasionally show nonsensical results if there are
too many negative returns in a series. And yes, day traders often have nega-
tive returns. Figure 11-10 shows the dollar-weighted rate of return using the
same data used in the two examples.
The result is 12.1 percent, lower than the other two examples because the
dollar-weighted return overstates the withdrawal and the loss in the last month
of the year. The withdrawals affect the account’s spending power, offsetting
the investment performance. But the overall account balance is up more than
12.1 percent, even considering the deposit at the beginning of May — the
weight of the cash flows threw off this calculation.
Because of the problems with dollar-weighted returns, professional investors
who analyze investment returns usually prefer the time-weighted, compound
average approach. Still, the dollar-weighted return has some value, especially
for an investor who wants to know how the asset value has changed over
time. Because a day trader is usually both an investor and an account owner,
the dollar-weighted rate of return can show whether the investment perfor-
mance is affecting spending power. This measure is particularly useful if you
are trying to decide whether to continue day trading
Just as you have alternatives in calculating your performance, so too does
anyone trying to sell you a trading system or training course. Ask questions
about the performance calculation method and how cash flows and expenses
are handled. The numbers might not look so great once you grade the math
behind them.

Chapter 11: But Did You Make Money? Evaluating Performance

The risk to your return 
Now that you have return numbers from your profit and loss statements and
your return calculations, it’s time to perform black-belt performance jujitsu and
determine your risk levels. I’m not going to go into all of the many risk and
volatility measures out there, because believe me, the good editors of the ...For
Dummies books don’t want to proofread all the math.
Batting average
Baseball players are judged by how often they hit the ball. After all, they can’t
score until they get on base, and they can’t get on base without a hit or a
walk. The number of hits relative to the number of times at bat is the batting
average. It’s a simple, beautiful number.
Day traders often calculate their batting average, too, although they might
call it their win-loss percentage or win ratio. It’s the same: the number of suc-
cessful trades to the total number of trades. Not all trades have to work out
for you to make money, but the more often the trades work for you, the better
your overall performance is likely to be. If you have both good performance
and a high batting average, then your strategy may have less risk than one
that relies on just a handful of home run trades amidst a bunch of strikeouts.
Standard deviation
Want something harder than your batting average? Turn to standard
deviation, which is tricky to calculate without a spreadsheet but forms the
core of many risk measures out there.
The standard deviation calculation starts with the average return over a given
time period. This is the expected return, the return that, on average, you get if
you stick with your trading strategy. But any given week, month, or year, the
return might be very different from what you expect. The more likely you are to
get what you expect, the less risk you take. Insured bank savings accounts pay
a low interest rate, but the rate is guaranteed. Day trading offers the potential
for much higher returns, but also the possibility that you could lose everything
any one month — especially if you can’t stick to your trading discipline.
The explanation is a lot easier to understand once you take a gander at 
Figure 11-11.
In Step One, you take every return over the time period and then find the
average. A simple mean will do. Here, there are 12 months, so I added all 12
returns and then divided by 12.
188
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

In Step Two, you take each of the 12 returns and then subtract the average
from it. This shows how much any one return differs from the average, to
give you a sense of how much the returns can go back and forth. 
In Step Three, you take each of those differences and then square them 
(multiply them by themselves). This gets rid of the negative numbers. When
you add those up, you get a number known in statistics as the sum of the
squares.
Now you have enough for Step Four: taking the average of the sum of the
squares.
And for Step Five: the square root of the average of the sum of the squares.
That square root from Step Five is the standard deviation, the magic number
we’re looking for. 
Of course, you don’t have to do all of this math. Almost all trading software
calculates standard deviation automatically, but at least you now know where
the calculation comes from.

The higher the standard deviation, the riskier the strategy. This number can
help you determine how comfortable you are with different trading tech-
niques you might be backtesting, as well as whether you want to stick with
your current strategy.
In academic terms, risk is the likelihood of getting any return other than the
return you expect. To most normal human beings, there’s no risk in getting
more than you expect — the problem is in getting less of a return than you
were counting on. This is a key limitation of risk evaluation.
Past performance is no indicator of future results. That truism applies to risk
as well as to return.
Using benchmarks to evaluate 
your performance
To understand your performance numbers, you need one more step: what
your performance is relative to what else you could be doing with your money.
Performance relative to an index
The most common way to think about investment performance is relative to
a market index. These are the measures of the overall market that are quoted
all the time in the news, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 and the Dow Jones
Industrial Average. Not only are these widely watched, but many mutual funds
and futures contracts are designed to mimic their performance. That means
investors can always do at least as well as the index itself, if their investment
objectives call for exposure to that part of the broad investment market. 
Indexes aren’t perfect. One big problem is that day traders often look at the
wrong index for the type of investment that they have. They’ll compare the
performance of trading in agricultural commodities to the Standard & Poor’s
500 when a commodities index would be a better measure. 
If you aren’t sure what to use, pick up a copy of Barron’s, a weekly financial
publication put out by Dow Jones & Company, the same people who publish
The Wall Street Journal and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In the Market
Lab section there is a long list of different stock, bond, and commodity indexes
for the United States and the world. You can find the one that best matches
your strategy and use it to compare your performance.
In some cases, your trading practices may overlap more than one index. If so,
pick the indexes that are appropriate and compare them only to those trades
190
Part II: Day Trading Tools 

that match. If you trade 40 percent currencies and 60 percent metals, then
you should create your own hybrid index that’s 40 percent currencies and 
60 percent metals.
Performance relative to your time
A few pages back when I talk about tracking your trades and doing a profit
and loss statement, I say that you should calculate your hourly wage. There’s
a reason for that. Instead of day trading, you could put your money in a nice,
simple, index mutual fund and take a regular job. If your hourly wage is less
than what you can earn elsewhere, you might want to consider doing just that.
Of course, there are benefits to working on your own that don’t often show
up in your bank account. I say this as someone who left finance to be a finan-
cial writer. If you enjoy day trading and if you make enough money to suit
your lifestyle, by all means, don’t let the relative numbers stop you.

I
n some ways, day trading is easy. Open up an account with a brokerage
firm and off you go, buying and selling securities! But how are you going to
know when to buy and when to sell? That’s not a simple matter. Most day
traders fail, because it’s easy to place the order, but hard to know if the order
is the right one.
Traders use different research systems to evaluate the market. They have
access to tools that can help them figure out when a security is likely to go
up in price and when it is likely to go down. 
Research systems fall into two categories: fundamental and technical.
Fundamental research looks at the specific factors that affect a security’s
value. What’s the relationship between the trade deficit and futures on two-
year treasury notes? What’s the prediction for summer rainfall in Iowa, and
how will that affect December corn futures? How dependent is a company on
new products to generate earnings growth?
Technical research, on the other hand, looks at the supply and demand for
the security itself. Are people buying more and more shares? Is the price
going up as they buy more, or does the price go up just a little bit? Does it
seem like everyone who is likely to buy has already bought, and what does
that mean for the future price? 

Anyone with a surefire system has already made a fortune and retired to a
private island in a tropical climate. He or she is too busy enjoying drinks with
umbrellas in them to share that surefire trading system with you. 
Research Techniques 
Used in Day Trading
Day traders need to make decisions fast, and they need to have a framework
for doing so. That’s why they rely on research. But what kind? Most day traders
rely heavily on technical research, which is an analysis of charts formed by
price patterns to measure the relative supply and demand for the security.
But some use fundamental analysis to help inform their decisions, too.
What direction is your research?
Securities are affected by matters specific to each type and by huge global
macroeconomic factors that affect every security in different ways. Some
traders prefer to think of the big picture first, whereas others start small. And
some use a combination of the two approaches. Neither is better; each is
simply a different perspective on what’s happening in the markets.
Top-down research
With a top-down approach, the trader looks at the big economic factors: inter-
est rates, exchange rates, government policies, and the like. How will these
things affect a particular sector or security? Is this a good time to buy stocks
or short interest rate futures? The top-down approach can help evaluate the
prices in big market sectors, and it can also help determine what factors are
affecting trading in a subsector. You don’t have to trade stock market index
futures to know that the outlook for the overall stock market will have an
effect on the trading of any specific company’s stock.
Bottom-up research
Bottom-up analysis looks at the specific performance of the asset. It looks at
the company’s prospects and then works backward to figure out how it will
get there. What has to happen for a company’s stock price to go up 20 per-
cent? What earnings does it have to report, what types of buyers have to
materialize, and what else has to happen in the economy? 
196
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

Fundamental research
Day traders do very little fundamental research. Sure, they know that demand
for ethanol affects corn prices, but they really want to know what the price
will do right now relative to where the price was a few minutes ago. How a
proposed farm bill might affect ethanol prices in six years doesn’t figure into
day trade, though. Knowing a little bit about the fundamentals — those basic
facts that affect the supply and demand for a security in all markets — can
help the day trader respond better to news events. It can also give you a
better feel for when swing trading (holding a position for several days) will
generate a better profit than closing out every night. But knowing a lot can
drag a day trader down.
Fundamental analysis can actually hurt you in day trading, because you may
start making decisions for the wrong reasons. If you know too much about
the fundamentals, you might start considering long-term outlooks instead of
short-term activity. For example, many people buy Standard & Poor’s (S&P)
500 Index mutual funds for their retirement accounts because they believe
that in the long run, the market will go up. That does not mean that people
should trade eMini S&P futures or an S&P exchange-traded fund today,
because there can be a lot of zigzagging between right now and the arrival of
the long-run price appreciation.
Fundamental research falls into two main categories: top-down and bottom-
up. As I mentioned earlier, top-down starts with broad economic considera-
tions and then looks at how those will affect a specific security. Bottom-up
looks at specific securities and then determines whether those are good buys
or sells right now.
If you love the very idea of fundamental research, then day trading is proba-
bly not for you. Day trading requires quick responses to price changes, not a
careful understanding of accounting methods and business trends. A little fun-
damental analysis can be helpful in day trading, but a lot can slow you down.
Technical analysis 
Information about the price, time, and volume of a security’s trading can be
plotted on a chart. The plots form patterns that can be analyzed to show
what happened. How did the supply and demand for a security change, and
why? And what does that mean for future supply and demand? Technical
analysis is based on the premise that securities prices move in trends, and
that those trends repeat themselves over time. Therefore, a trader who can
197
Chapter 12: Using Fundamental and Technical Analysis

recognize a trend on the charts can determine where prices are most likely to
go until some unforeseen event comes along that creates a new trend.
The basic element of technical analysis is a bar, which shows you the high, low,
open, and closing price of a security for a given day. It looks like Figure 12-1.
In most markets, every day generates a new bar (many traders talk about
bars instead of days, and they aren’t talking about where they go after work).
A collection of bars, with all their different high, low, open, and close points,
is put together into a larger chart. Often, a plot of the volume for each bar
runs underneath, with the result looking like Figure 12-2.
Many patterns formed in the charts are associated with future price moves.
Technical analysts thus spend a lot of time looking at the charts to see if they
can predict what will happen. Many software packages (some of which are
discussed in Chapter 7) send traders signals when certain technical patterns
occur, so that the traders can place orders accordingly.

Technical analysis is a way to measure the supply and demand in the market.
It’s a tool for analyzing the markets, not predicting them. If it were that easy,
everyone would be able to make money in the markets. 
Price changes
Market observers debate market efficiency all the time. In an efficient market,
all information about a security is already included in the security’s price, so
there’s no point to doing any research at all. Few market participants are will-
ing to go that far, but they concede the point that the price is the single most
important summary of information about a company. That means that techni-
cal analysis, looking at how the price changes over time, is a way of learning
about whether a security’s prospects are improving or getting worse.
Volume changes
The basic bar shows how price changed during the day, but adding volume
information tells the other part of the story: how much of a security was
demanded at that price. If demand is going up, then more people want the
security, so they are willing to pay more for it. The price tells traders what
the market knows; the volume tells them how many people in the market
know it.
How to Use Technical Analysis
Technical analysis helps day traders identify changes in the supply and
demand for a security that may lead to profitable price changes ahead. It
gives traders a way to talk about and think about the market so that they can
be more effective.
Charts are generated by most brokerage firm quote systems, sometimes 
with the help of additional software that automatically marks the chart with
199
Chapter 12: Using Fundamental and Technical Analysis
Bulls and bears and pork bellies, oh my!
Traders work cattle and hogs at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, but bulls and bears are in
every market. What do those mythical animals
symbolize?
Bulls believe that the market is going up, and
bullish news and bullish patterns are good.
Bears believe that the market is going down, so
bearish news and bearish patterns are bad.
No one is exactly sure why the words came into
use, but the best guess for the symbolism is that
when attacked, bulls charge and bears retreat.

trendlines. That’s because a technical trader is looking for those trendlines. Is
the security going up in price, and is that trend going to continue? That’s the
information that a trader needs before placing an order to buy or sell.
One interesting aspect of technical analysis is that the basics hold no matter
what market you are looking at. Technical analysis can help you monitor
trends in the stock market, the bond market, the commodity market, and the
currency market. Anywhere people try to match their supply and their
demand to make a market, technical analysis can be used to show how well
they’re doing it.
Finding trends
A technical analyst usually starts off by looking at a chart and drawing lines
that show the overall direction of the price bars for the period in question.
Rather than plot the graph on paper or print out the screen, she probably
uses software to draw the lines. Figure 12-3 shows what this basic analysis
looks like.
With the basic trendlines in place, the trader can start thinking about how
the trends have played out so far and what might happen next. 
Here’s the thing about trends: Sometimes it’s good to follow, and sometimes
it’s good to deviate. Remember when you were a kid, and you wanted to do

something that all your friends were doing? And your mother would invariably
say, “If all your friends jumped off of a bridge, would you have to jump off, too?”
Well, Mom, guess what? If the bridge was on fire, if the escape routes were
blocked by angry mobs, if the water were just a few feet down, yes, I just
might jump off the bridge like everyone else. Likewise, if someone was paying
us good money to jump, and I knew I wasn’t likely to get hurt on the way
down, I’d be over the railing in a flash. Sometimes it’s good to be a follower.
But if my friends were idiots, if there were no fire and no angry mob, and if I
couldn’t swim, I might not be so hasty.
Trend following is like those mythical childhood friends on that mythical
hometown bridge. Sometimes, you should join the crowd. Other times, it’s
best to deviate. 
Draw those trendlines!
The most basic trendline is a line that shows the general direction of the trend.
And that’s a good start, but it doesn’t tell you all you need to know. The next
step is to take out your ruler, or set your software, to find the trendlines that
connect the highs and the lows. That will create a channel that tells you the
support level — the trendline for the lows — and the resistance level — the
trendline for the highs. Unless something happens to change the trend, secu-
rities tend to move within the channel, so extending the line into the future
can give you a sense of where the security is likely to trade. Figure 12-4 shows
you an example.
When a security hits its support level, it is usually seen as relatively cheap —
so that’s a good time to buy. When a security hits its resistance level, it is
usually seen as relatively expensive, so that’s a good time to sell. Some day
traders find that simply moving between buying at the support and selling at
the resistance can be a profitable strategy, at least until something happens
that changes those two levels.

Chapter 12: Using Fundamental and Technical Analysis

Calculating indicators
In addition to drawing lines, technical analysts use their calculators — or
have their software make calculations — to come up with different indicators.
These are numbers that are used to gauge performance. The following is a list
of some common indicators, with definitions.
Pivot points
A pivot point is the average of the high, low, and close price for the day. If the
next day’s price closes above the pivot point, that sets a new support level,
and if the next day’s price is below the pivot point, that sets a new resistance
level. Hence, calculating pivot points and how they change might indicate
new upper and lower stops for your trading. (You can learn more about using
stops in Chapter 2.)
For markets that are open more or less continuously, such as foreign
exchange, the close price is set arbitrarily. The usual custom in the United
States is to use the price at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, which is the closing time
for the New York Stock Exchange.
Moving averages
Looking at all those little high-low-open-close lines on a chart will give your
bifocals a workout. To make the trend easier to spot, traders calculate a
moving average. It’s calculated by averaging the closing prices for a given
time period. Some traders prefer to look at the last 5 days, some at the last 
60 days. Every day, the latest price is added, and the oldest price is dropped
to make that day’s calculation. Given the wonders of modern computing tech-
nology, it’s easy to pull up moving averages for almost any time period you
want. The average for each day is then plotted against the price chart to
show how the trend is changing over time. Figure 12-5 shows an example of a
10-day moving average chart.
Figure 12-5:
This price
chart shows
a 10-day
moving
average.
202
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

Traders use the moving average line to look for crossovers, convergences,
and divergences. A crossover occurs whenever the price crosses the moving
average line. Usually, it’s a good idea to buy when the price crosses above the
moving average line and to sell when the price crosses below it. 
To use convergence and divergence in analysis, the trader looks at moving
averages from different time periods, such as 5 days, 10 days, and 20 days.
Figure 12-6 shows what it looks like.
When two or three of the moving average lines converge (come together),
that means that the trend may be ending. That often makes it a good time to
buy if the trend has been down — and a good time to sell if the trend has
been up. If two or three of the moving average lines split up and diverge, that
means that the trend is likely to continue. That means that it’s probably a
good time to buy if the trend is up and sell if the trend is down.
A moving average is a lagging indicator. It sums up trading activity in the last
5, 10, 30, or 60 days. That means that the line will smooth out changes in the
trend that may affect future prices.
Trends move in phases

observed in market behavior. Knowing the phases of a trend can help you

better evaluate what’s happening. Here is a summary of some phases of a
trend:
 Accumulation: This is the first part of the trend, where traders get
excited about a security and its prospects. They start new positions or
add to existing ones.
 Main phase (also called continuation): Here, the trend moves along
nicely, with no unusual price action. The highs get higher on an uptrend,
and the lows get lower on a downtrend. A trader might make money, but
not big money, following the trend here.
 Consolidation (also called congestion): This is a sideways market. The
security stays within the trend, but without hitting higher highs or lower
lows. It just stays within the trading range. A consolidation phase is
good for scalpers, who make a large volume of trades in search of very
small profits. It can be boring for everyone else.
 Retracement (also called correction or pullback): This is a secondary
trend, a short-term pullback away from the main trend to the support
level. Retracements create buying opportunities, but they can also kill
day traders who are following the trend.
 Distribution: In the distribution phase, traders don’t think that the 
security can go up in price any more. Hence, they tend to sell in large
volume.
 Reversal: This is the point where the trend changes. It’s time to sell if
you had been following an uptrend and buy if you had been following a
downtrend. Many reversals follow classic patterns, which are discussed
later in this chapter.
Those ever-changing trends
Although technical traders look to follow trends, they also look for situations
where the trend changes so that they can find new profit opportunities. In
general, day traders are going to follow trends, and swing traders — those
who hold securities for a few days or even weeks — are going to be more
interested in identifying changes that may play out over time. 
Momentum
Following the trend is great, but if the trend is moving quickly, you want to
know so that you can get ahead of it. If the rate of change on the trend is
going up, then rising prices are likely to occur.
To calculate momentum, take today’s closing price for a security, divide that
by the closing price ten days ago, and then multiply by 100. This gives you a
204
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

momentum indicator. If the price didn’t go anywhere, the momentum indica-
tor will be 100. If the price went up, the indicator will be greater than 100.
And if it went down, it will be less than 100. In technical analysis, trends are
usually expected to continue, so a security with a momentum indicator above
100 is expected to keep going up, all else being equal.
But it’s that “all else being equal” that’s the sticky part. Technical analysts
usually track momentum indicators over time to see if the positive momen-
tum is, itself, a trend. In fact, momentum indicators are a good confirmation
of the underlying trend.
Momentum is a leading technical indicator. It tells you what is likely to
happen in the future, not what has happened in the past.
Momentum trading is usually done with some attention to the fundamentals.
When key business fundamentals such as sales or profits are accelerating at
the same time that the security is going up in price, the momentum is likely
to continue for some time. You can learn more about momentum trading and
investing in Chapter 16.
Finding breakouts
A breakout occurs when a security price passes through and stays above —
or below — the resistance or support line, which creates a new trend with
new support and resistance levels. A one-time breakout may just be an anom-
aly, what technicians sometimes call a false breakout, but pay attention to
two or more breakouts. Figure 12-7 shows what breakouts look like.
Figure 12-7:
A breakout
indicates a
new trend.
205
Chapter 12: Using Fundamental and Technical Analysis

When a true breakout occurs, a new trend starts. That means an upward
breakout will be accompanied by rising prices, and a downward breakout will
be accompanied by falling prices.
With a false breakout, some traders buy or sell thinking that the trend will
continue, see that it doesn’t, and then turn around and reverse their posi-
tions at a loss.
A false breakout can cause those misled traders to wreak havoc for a day or
two of trading. This is where the ability to size up the intelligence of the other
traders in the market can come in handy.
Good technical analysts look at several different indicators in order to see
whether a change in trend is real or just one of those things that goes away
quickly as the old trend resumes.
Reading the Charts
How long does it take to find the trend? How long does it take for the trend to
play out? When do you act on it? Do you have minutes, hours, or days to act?
Because markets tend to move in cycles, technical analysts look for patterns
in the price charts that give them an indication of how long any particular
trend may last. In this section, I show you some of the common patterns that
day traders look for when they do technical analysis. Alas, some are only
obvious in hindsight, but knowing what the patterns mean can help you make
better forecasts of where a security price should go. 
This is just an introduction to some of the better-known (and cleverly
named) patterns. Technical analysts look for many others, and you really
need a book on the subject to understand them all. Check out the appendix
for more information on technical analysis so that you can get a feel for how
you can apply it to your trading style.
Waving your pennants and flags
Pennants and flags are chart patterns that show retracements, which are
short-term deviations from the main trend. With a retracement, there’s no
breakout from the support or resistance level, but the security isn’t following
the trend, either. 
Figure 12-8 shows a pennant. Notice how the support and resistance lines of
the pennant (which occur within the support and resistance lines of a much
larger trend) converge almost to a point.
206
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

Figure 12-9, by contrast, is a flag. The main difference between a flag and a
pennant is that the flag’s support and resistance lines are parallel.
Pennants and flags are usually found in the middle of the main phase of a
trend, and they seem to last for two weeks before going back to the trendline.
They are almost always accompanied by falling volume. In fact, if the trading
volume isn’t falling, you are probably looking at a reversal — a change in
trend — rather than a retracement.
Not just for the shower: 
head and shoulders
The head and shoulders formation is a series of three peaks within a price
chart. The peaks on the left and right (the shoulders) should be relatively
smaller than the peak in the center (the head). The shoulders connect at a
price known as the neckline, and once the right shoulder formation is
reached, the price plunges down.

207
Chapter 12: Using Fundamental and Technical Analysis

The head and shoulders is one of the most bearish technical patterns, and it
looks like Figure 12-10.
The head and shoulders formation seems to result from traders holding out
for a last high after a security has had a long price run. At some point,
though, the trend changes, because nothing grows forever. And when the
trend changes, the prices fall.
An upside-down head and shoulders sometimes appears at the end of a
downtrend, and it signals that the security is about to increase in price.
Drinking from a cup and handle
When a security hits a peak in price and falls, sometimes because of bad
news, it can stay low for a while. But eventually, the bad news works itself
out, the underlying fundamentals improve, and it becomes time to buy again.
The technical analyst sees this play out in a cup and handle formation, and
Figure 12-11 shows you what it looks like.
The handle forms as those who bought at the old high and who felt burned
by the decline take their money and get out. But other traders, who do not
have the same history with the security, recognize that the price will proba-
bly resume going up now that those old sellers are out of the market.
A cup and handle formation generally shows up over a long period of trading —
sometimes as long as a year — so, many subtrends will occur during that time.
A day trader will likely care more about those day-to-day changes than the
underlying trend taking place. Still, if you see that cup formation and the hint
of a handle, it’s a sign that the security will probably start to rise in price.

Mind the gap
Gaps are breaks in prices that show up all the time, usually when some news
event takes place between trading sessions that causes an adjustment in
prices and volume. Whether it’s an acquisition, a product line disappoint-
ment, or a war that broke out overnight, the news is significant enough to
change the trend, and that’s why traders pay attention when they see gaps.
A gap is a break between two bars, and Figure 12-12 shows what one looks like:
Gaps are usually great signals. If a security gaps up at the open, that usually
means that a strong uptrend is beginning, so it’s time to buy. Likewise, if it
gaps down, that’s often the start of a downtrend, so it’s better to sell.
Day traders can get sucked into a gap, a situation known as a gap and crap
(or gap and trap, if you prefer more genteel language). When the security
goes up in price, many traders view that as a great time to sell, so the day
trader who buys on the gap up immediately gets slammed by all the selling
pressure. Some day traders prefer to wait at least 30 minutes before trading
on an opening gap, while others rely on their knowledge of the buyers and
sellers in a given market to decide what to do.

Chapter 12: Using Fundamental and Technical Analysis

Grab your pitchforks!
A pitchfork is sometimes called an Andrews pitchfork after Alan Andrews, the
technical analyst who popularized it. It identifies long-run support and resis-
tance levels for subtrends by creating a channel around the main trendline.
Figure 12-13 shows what it looks like.
The upper fork shows the resistance level for upward subtrends, and the
lower fork shows the support level for lower subtrends. The middle line
forms a support and a resistance line, depending on which side of it trading
takes place. If the price crosses above the mid-line, it can be expected to go
no higher than the highest line. Likewise, if it crosses below the mid-line, it
can be expected to go no lower than the lowest line. 
Different Approaches to 
Technical Analysis 
Technical analysts tend to group themselves under different schools of thought.
Each approaches the charts differently and uses them to glean different infor-
mation about how securities prices are likely to perform. In this section, I
offer an introduction to a few of these approaches. If one strikes your fancy,
you can look in the Appendix for resources to help you learn more.
Dow Theory
The Dow Theory was developed by Charles Dow, the founder of The Wall
Street Journal. The theory and the market indexes that are part of it helped

sell newspapers; they also helped people make money in the markets. It’s the
basis for the traditional technical analysis described in this chapter. Dow
believed that securities move in trends; that the trends form patterns that
traders can identify; and that those trends remain in place until some major
event takes place that changes them. Further, trends in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average and the Dow Jones Transportation Average can predict
overall market performance.
Not all technicians believe that the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Dow
Jones Transportation Average are primary indicators in the modern econ-
omy, but they rely on the Dow Theory for their analysis, and they still read
the Journal.
Fibonacci numbers and the Elliott Wave
Remember back when you had to take standardized tests, you’d often have to
figure the next number in a series? Well, here’s such a test. What’s the next
number in this series? (Hint: this is not a phone number in Chad.)
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
If you answered 34, you’re right! The series is known as the Fibonacci num-
bers, sometimes called the Fibonacci series or just the Fibs. It’s found by
adding together the preceding two numbers in the series, starting with the
first two digits on the number line. 0 + 1 = 1; 1 + 1 = 2; 1 + 2 = 3; and so on into
infinity. Furthermore, once the series gets well into the double digits, the
ratio of one number to the one next to it settles at .618, a number known as
the Golden Proportion; this means that the ratio of the smaller and the larger
of two numbers is the same as the ratio of the larger number to the sum of
the two numbers. In nature, this is the proportion of a perfect spiral, like that
found on a pinecone and a pineapple.
Ralph Elliott was a trader who believed that over the long run, the market
moved in waves described by the Fibonacci series. For example, Elliott believed
that a bull market would be characterized by three down waves and five up
waves. Furthermore, he believed that support and resistance levels would be
found 61.8 percent above lows and below highs. If a security falls 61.8 percent
from a high, that would be good time to buy, under the Elliott Wave system.
Elliott believed that these waves ranged from centuries to minutes, so traders
and investors both use the system to identify the market trends that suit
their timeframes. Others — including me — think it’s highly unlikely that the
human activity in the stock market would follow the same natural order as
the ratio of the spiral on a mollusk shell.

Chapter 12: Using Fundamental and Technical Analysis

Japanese Candlestick charting
Candlestick charts were developed by traders in the Japanese rice futures
markets in the 18th century, and they’ve carried through into the present.
The basic charts are similar to the high-low-close-open bars that I talk about
earlier in this chapter, but they are shaped a little differently to carry more
information. Figure 12-14 shows an example:
The length of the rectangle (the so-called candle, also known as the body)
between the open and the close price gives a sense of how much volatility
the security has, especially relative to the high and low prices above and
below the rectangle (the so-called wick, also known as the shadow). The
shapes and colors create different patterns that traders can use to discern
the direction of future prices. (Most technical analysis packages will color the
candlesticks green on up days and red on down days, to make finding trends
even easier.)
The Gann system
William Gann supposedly made 50 million dollars in the stock and commodi-
ties markets in the first half of the 20th century using a system that he may or
may not have taught to others before his death. There’s a lot of mystery and
mythology about the Gann system; some traders rely on what they perceive
to be his method, whereas others dismiss it, in part because Gann relied on
astrology to build his forecasts.
The Gann system, as it is defined nowadays, looks at the relationship between
price and time. If a security moves one point in one day, that’s a 1 × 1 Gann
High
Low
Open or close
Open or close

cated bars.
212
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

angle, and that’s normal trading. If a security moves two points in one day, it
would be said to create a 2 × 1 Gann angle, which is bullish. An angle of less
than 1 × 1 would be bearish. 
Furthermore, Gann recognized that the market would move back and forth
while in a general upward or downward cycle, but some of those fluctuations
were more positive than others. Just as the system looks for price move-
ments over time with even proportions (1 × 1, 2 × 1, and so on), it also looks
for orderly retracements. When a security moves back 50 percent, say from a
low of $20 to a high of $40 and then back to $30, it would be a good time to
buy under the Gann system. 
Many traders swear by the 50 percent retracement guide — even those who
think that Gann is otherwise a crazy system. This may be the origin of one
hoary trading chestnut: buy whenever a price dips, because it’s likely to be
heading on its way back up.
Pitfalls of Technical Analysis
As discussed in Chapter 7, a lot of people make a lot of money selling ser-
vices to day traders. They produce videos, organize seminars, and (ahem)
write books to tell you how to be a success. But in the financial world, suc-
cess is a combination of luck, skill, and smarts. 
Before you commit wholeheartedly to any particular school of research, and
before you plunk down a lot of money for some “proven” system demon-
strated on an infomercial, think about who are you are and what you are
trying to do. Despite all the books and all the seminars and all the business-
school debates, every form of research has its drawbacks. Keep them in mind
as you develop your day-trading business plan.
If it’s obvious, there’s no opportunity
Many day trading systems work much of the time. For example, a security
gaps up, meaning that due to positive news or high demand, the price jumps
from one trade to the next (refer to Figure 12.12 for a gap formation). This is
good, and the security is likely to keep going up. So you buy the security, you
make money. Bingo! But here’s the thing: Everyone is looking at that gap,
everyone is assuming that the stock will go up, so everyone will buy and that
will bid up the security. Double Bingo! The profit opportunity is gone. So
maybe you’re better off going short? Or avoiding the situation entirely? Who
213
Chapter 12: Using Fundamental and Technical Analysis

knows! And that’s the problem. Looking for obvious patterns like gaps tells
you a lot about what is happening in the market, but only your own judgment
and experience can tell you what the next move should be.
Reverse-reverse psychology
Sitcoms always revert to tired formulas. The smart kid brags about how he or
she will dominate a talent or quiz show and then panics on the big day. The
two people who can’t stand each other will get a horrible sickness that
requires them to be quarantined — in the same hospital ward. The teenage
son can’t believe what fabulous soup his mother made, and it turns out she
was brewing a homemade cleaning solution.
Or there’s this one: The kids want to do something that the parents don’t
approve of. The parents try reverse psychology. “Go to the party, kids, have
fun!” they say, thinking that the kids will not want to do anything that parents
approve of. The kids, knowing that the parents are trying to pull the reverse
psychology, decide to play along with reverse-reverse psychology. “Don’t
worry, we’ll stay home!” they say — and then sneak out. Hilarity ensues.
Technical analysis is a useful way to gauge market psychology. But when
trying to determine the mood of the market, it’s really easy to start over-
analyzing and working yourself into a knot. Should you follow the trend or
trade against it? But if everyone trades against it, would you be better off 
following it?
Instead of puzzling over what’s really going on, develop a system that you
trust. Do that through backtesting, simulation, and performance analysis.
Chapter 11 has plenty of advice on how to do this. The more confident you
feel in how you should react given a market situation, the better your trading
will be.
The random walk with an upward bias
Under the efficient markets theory, all information is already included in a
security’s price. Until new information comes into the market, the prices
move in a random pattern, so any security is as likely to do as well as any
other. In some markets, like the stock market, this random path has an
upward bias, meaning that as long as the economy is growing, companies
should perform well, too; therefore, the movement is more likely to be
upward than downward, but the magnitude of the movement is random.
214
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

If price movements are random, some people are going to win and some are
going to lose, no matter what systems they use to pick securities. If price
movements are random with an upward bias, then more people are going to
win than lose, no matter what systems they use to pick securities. Some of
those who win are going to tout their system, even though it was really
random chance that led to their success.
Technical analysis is a useful way to measure the relative supply and demand
in the market, and that in turn is a way to gauge the psychology of those who
are trading. But it’s not perfect. Before you plunk down a lot of money to
learn a complex trading system or to subscribe to a newsletter offering a
can’t-miss method of trading, ask yourself if the person selling it is smart or
just lucky. A good system gives you discipline and a way to think about the
market relative to your trading style. A bad system costs a lot of money and
may have worked for a brief moment in the past, with no relevance to current
conditions.

D
ay traders put their research to work through a range of different strate-
gies. All strategies have two things in common: They are designed to
make money, and they are designed to work in a single day. And the best ones
help traders cut through the psychology of the market.
Although some trading is handled through automatic algorithms and other
programs that place orders whenever certain conditions take place, the vast
majority of trading takes place between human beings, who want to make
money, in markets where short-term profit potentials can be very small. As
much as they want to be dispassionate, traders are going to get sucked into
hope, fear, and greed: the three emotions that ruin people every day. To com-
plicate matters, many markets, such as options and futures, are zero-sum
markets, meaning that there is a loser for every winner. Some markets, such
as the stock market, have a positive bias, meaning that there are more win-
ners than losers in the long run — but that doesn’t mean that will be the 
case today.
With thin profit potential and so much emotional upheaval, it can be tough 
to make money in the long run. This chapter might help. In it, I cover some
common day trading strategies, and I discuss some of the cold analysis that
goes into figuring out the psychology of the markets. 

The Psychology of the Markets
For every buyer, there is a seller. There has to be, or no transaction will take
place. The price changes to reach the point where the buyer is willing to buy
the security and the seller is willing to part with it. This is basic supply and
demand. The financial markets are more efficient at matching supply and
demand than almost any other market there is. There are no racks of unsold
sweaters at the end of the season, no hot model cars that can’t be purchased
at any price, no long lines to get a table. The prices change to match the
demand, and those who want to pay the price — or receive the price — are
going to make a trade.
Despite this ruthless capitalistic efficiency underlying trading, the markets
are also dominated by human emotion and psychology. All the buyers and all
the sellers are looking at the same information, but they are reaching differ-
ent conclusions. There’s a seller out there for every buyer, so the trader look-
ing to buy needs to know why the seller is willing to make a deal.
And why would someone be on the other side of your trade?
 The other person may have a different time horizon.
For example, long-term investors might sell on bad news that changes a
security’s outlook. A short-term trader might not care about the long-
term outlet, if the selling in the morning is overdone, creating an oppor-
tunity to buy now and sell at a higher price in the afternoon.
 The other person may have a different risk profile.
A conservative investor might not want to own shares in a company
that’s being acquired by a high-flying technology company. That investor
will sell, and someone with more interest in growth will be buying.
 The other person may be engaging in wishful thinking, or acting out
of fear, or trading from sheer greed.
 You may be engaging in wishful thinking, acting out of fear, or trading
from sheer greed.
It’s highly unlikely that you are smarter than everyone else trading, but you
might be more rational and disciplined. In the long run, controlling your emo-
tions and sticking to your limits will make you more money than if you are
smart but can’t control your trading. And if you happen to be both disci-
plined and smart, you might do very well.
218
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

Betting on the buy side
Every market participant has his or her own set of reasons and rationales for
placing an order today. In general, though, it’s safe to say that although there
are many reasons to sell — to pay taxes, generate cash for college tuition, or
meet a pension obligation, among many others — there’s only one reason to
buy: You think the security is going up in price. 
For that reason alone, traders often pay more attention to what is happening
to buy orders than to sell orders. They look at the number of buy orders
coming in, how large they are, and at what price to get a sense of who out
there is projecting a profit. I cover volume and price indicators in more detail
later in the chapter.
Because there are so many good reasons to sell but only one good reason to
buy, it can take a long time for the market to recognize bearish (pessimistic)
sentiment indicators. Even if you see that prices should start to go down in
the near future, you have to consider that the market today can be very dif-
ferent from what you see coming up. And day traders only have today.
The projection trap
If you took a peek at some of the technical analysis charts in Chapter 12, you
may have noticed that it’s possible to see what you want to see in some price
charts. And if you thought a little about fundamental analysis, you might
have seen that it’s just as easy to interpret information the way you want to,
too. Instead of looking objectively at what the market is telling them, some
traders see what they want to see. That’s one reason it’s so important to
know your system and use your limits. Information in Chapters 2 and 11 can
help you with both.
The best traders are able to figure out the psychology of the market almost
by instinct. They can’t necessarily explain what they do — which makes it
hard for someone trying to learn from them. But they can tell you this much:
If you can rationally determine why the person on the other side of the trade
is trading, you can be in a better position to make money and avoid the big
mistakes brought on by hope, fear, and greed.
Measuring the Mood of the Market
For decades, most traders were rooted on the floors of the exchanges. They
had a good sense of the mood of the market because they could pick up the
mood of the people in the pits with them. They often knew their fellow
traders well enough to know how good they were or the needs of the people
219
Chapter 13: Market Indicators and Day Trading Strategies

they were working for. It made for a clubby atmosphere, despite all the shout-
ing and arm waving. It wasn’t the most efficient way to trade big volume, but
it allowed traders to read the minds of those around them.
And now, almost all trading is electronic, and not all those old floor traders
have been able to make the transition. Some find that unless they can watch
the behavior of other traders and hear the emotions in their voices, they
can’t gauge what’s happening in the markets.
Other professional traders, who work for brokerage firms or fund companies,
trade electronically, but along long tables (known as trading desks) where
they sit next to colleagues trading similar securities. Even though everyone is
trading off a screen, they share a mood and thus a sense of what’s happening
out there. Some day traders can replicate this by setting up shop at a trading
arcade, a business that operates trading desks for day traders (and you can
learn more about them in Chapter 6), but most traders are working alone at
home, with nothing but the information on their screens to tell them what’s
happening in the market.
There are ways to figure out what’s happening, even just looking at the screen,
and some of these may work for you. These include price, volume, and volatil-
ity indicators, and you’re in the right place to learn more about them.
Some traders rely on Internet chat rooms to help them measure market senti-
ment. This can be risky. Some chat rooms have smart people who are willing
to share their perspectives on the market, but many are dominated by novice
traders who have no good information to share, or by people who are trying
to manipulate the market in their favor. Check them out carefully before lurk-
ing or participating.
Pinpointing with price indicators
In an efficient market, all information about a security is included in its price.
If the price is high and going up, then the fundamentals are doing well. If the
price is low and going lower, then something’s not good. And everything in
between means something else.
The change in a security’s price gives you a first cut of information. Price
changes can be analyzed in other ways to help you know when to buy or
when to sell.
Momentum
Momentum, which is also discussed in Chapter 12, is the rate at which a
security’s price is increasing (or decreasing). If momentum is strong and pos-
itive, then the security will show both higher highs and higher lows. People
220
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

want to buy it for whatever reason, and the price reflects that. Likewise,
momentum can be strong and negative, and negative momentum is marked
with lower highs and lower lows. No one seems interested in buying, and that
keeps dragging the price down. 
The exact amount of momentum that a security has can be measured with
indicators known as momentum oscillators. A classic momentum oscillator
starts with the moving average, which is the average of the closing prices 
for a past time period, say the last ten trading days. Then the change in each
day’s moving average is plotted below the price line. When the oscillator is
positive, traders say that the security is overbought; when it is negative, they
say that the security is oversold. Figure 13-1 shows a momentum oscillator
plotted below a price line.
If a momentum oscillator shows that a security is overbought (when it’s
above the center line), that means that too many people own it relative to 
the remaining demand in the market, and some of them will start selling.
Remember, some of these people have perfectly good reasons for selling that
may have nothing to do with the underlying fundamentals of the security, but
they are going to sell anyway, and that will bring the price down. Traders who
see that a security is overbought will want to sell in advance of those people.

tum

Chapter 13: Market Indicators and Day Trading Strategies

If a momentum oscillator shows that a security is oversold (when the line is
below the center line), that means that the security is probably too cheap.
Everyone who wanted to get out has gotten out, and now it may be a bargain.
When the buyers who see the profit opportunity jump in, the price will go up.
The trend is your friend . . . until the end. Although there are great reasons 
to follow price trends, remember that they all end, so you still need to pay
attention to your money management and your stops, no matter how strong
a trend seems to be.
Given that most trends end, or at least zig and zag along the way, some
traders look for securities that fit what they call the 1-2-3-4 criterion. If a 
security goes up in price for three consecutive days, then it’s likely to go
down on the fourth day. Likewise, if a security has fallen in price for three
days in a row, it’s likely to be up on day four. Be sure to run some simulations
(see Chapter 11) to see if this works for a market that interests you.
Trading on the tick
A tick is an upward or downward price change. For some securities, such as
futures contracts, the tick size is defined as part of the contract. For others,
such as stocks, a tick can be anywhere from a penny to infinity (at least in
theory). 
You can also calculate the tick indicator for the market as a whole. (In fact,
most quotation systems calculate the market tick for you.) This is the total
number of securities in that market that traded up on the last trade, minus the
number that traded down on the last trade. If the tick is a positive number,
that’s good — that means that the market as a whole has a lot of buying inter-
est. Although any given security might not do as well, a positive tick shows
that most people in the market have a positive perspective right now.
By contrast, a negative tick shows that most people in the market are watch-
ing prices fall. Sure, some prices are going up, but there are more unhappy
people than happy ones (assuming that most people are trading on the long
side, meaning that they make money when prices go up, not down). This
shows that there’s negative sentiment in the market right now.
Tracking the trin
Trin is short for trading indicator, and it’s another measure of market senti-
ment based on how many prices have gone up relative to how many have
gone down. Most quotation systems will pull up the trin for a given market,
but you can also calculate it on your own. The math looks like Figure 13-2.
222
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

The numerator is based on the tick: the number of securities that went up
divided by (not less) the number that went down. The denominator includes
the volume: the number of shares or contracts that traded for those securi-
ties that went up, divided by the number of securities traded for those that
went down in price. This tells you just how strongly buyers supported the
securities that were going up and just how much selling pressure faced those
securities that went down.
If the trin is less than 1.00, that usually means that there are a lot of buyers
taking securities up in price, and that’s positive. If the trin is above 1.00, then
the sellers are acting more strongly, and that indicates that there’s a lot of
negative sentiment in the market.
Volume
The trin indicator looks at price in conjunction with volume. That makes this
a good time to introduce volume indicators. 
Volume tells you how much trading is taking place in the market. How excited
are people about the current price? Do they see this as great opportunity to
buy or to sell? Are they selling fast, to get out now, or are they taking a more
leisurely approach to the market these days? This information is carried in
the volume of the trading, and it’s an important adjunct to the information
you see in the prices. Volume tells you whether there’s enough support to
maintain price trends, or if price trends are likely to change soon.
Force index
The force index gives you a sense of the strength of a trend. It starts with
information from prices, namely that if the closing price today is higher than
the closing price yesterday, that’s positive for the security. And that means
decline volume
advance volume

advances
Figure 13-2:

223
Chapter 13: Market Indicators and Day Trading Strategies

that if today’s closing price is lower than yesterday’s, then the force is gener-
ally negative. Then that price information is combined with volume informa-
tion. The more volume that goes with that price change, the stronger that
positive or negative force.
Although many quotation systems will calculate force for you, you can do it
yourself, too. For each trading day,
Force index = volume × (today’s moving average –
yesterday’s moving average)
In other words, the force index simply scales the moving average momentum
oscillator (discussed above) for the amount of volume that accompanies that
price change. That way, the trader has a sense of just how overbought or
oversold the security is any particular day. 
On-balance volume
The on-balance volume is a running total of the amount of trading in a secu-
rity. To calculate it, first look at today’s closing price relative to yesterday’s. 
If today’s close is higher than yesterday’s, then add today’s volume to yester-
day’s on-balance volume. If today’s closing price is less than yesterday’s, then
subtract today’s volume from yesterday’s total. And if today’s close is the
same as yesterday’s, don’t do anything: Today’s balance is the same as 
yesterday’s. 
Many traders track on-balance volume over time, and here’s why: A change 
in volume signals a change in demand. That might not show up in price right
away if there are enough buyers to absorb volume from sellers. But if there
are still more buyers out there, then the price is going to go up. Hence, the
volume from even small day-to-day increases in price need to be added up
over time. If the volume keeps going up, then at some point, prices are going
to have to go up to meet the demand.
On the downside, the volume from small price declines will add up over time,
too. Over time, it may show that there is very little pent-up interest, indicat-
ing that prices could languish for some time.
Many traders look to on-balance volume to gauge the behavior of so-called
smart money, such as pension funds, hedge funds, and mutual fund compa-
nies. Unlike individual investors, these big institutional accounts tend to
trade on fundamentals rather than emotion. They tend to start buying a secu-
rity at the point where the dumb money is tired of owning it, so their early
buying may show big volume with little price change. But as the institutions
keep buying, the price will have to go up to get the smarter individuals and
the early institutions to part with their shares.
224
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

Open interest
Open interest has a different meaning in the stock market than in the options
and futures markets, but in both cases, it gives traders useful information
about demand.
In the stock market, open interest is the number of buy orders submitted
before the market opens. If the open interest is high, that means that people
are ready to add shares to their positions or initiate new positions, and that
in turn means that the stock is likely to go up in price on the demand.
In the options and futures markets, open interest is the number of contracts
at the end of every day that have not been exercised, closed out, or allowed
to expire. Day traders won’t have open interest, because by definition, day
traders close out at the end of every day. But some traders will keep open
interest, either because they think that their position has the ability to
increase in profitability or because they are hedging another transaction and
need to keep that options or futures position in place. If open interest in a
contract is increasing, then new money is coming into the market and prices
are likely to continue to go up. This is especially true if volume is increasing
at about the same rate as open interest. On the other hand, if open interest is
falling, then people are closing out their positions because they no longer see
a profit potential, and prices are likely to fall. 
Volatility
The volatility of a security is a measure of how much it tends to go up or down
in a given time period. The more volatile the security, the more the price will
fluctuate. Most day traders prefer volatile securities, because that creates
more opportunities to make a profit in a short amount of time. But volatility
can make it tougher to gauge market sentiment. If a security is volatile, the
mood can change quickly. What looked like a profit opportunity at the market
open might be gone by lunchtime — and back again before the close. 
Average true range
The average true range is a measure of volatility that’s commonly used in
commodity markets, but some stock traders use it, too. Many quotation sys-
tems calculate it automatically, but if you want to do it yourself, start with
finding each day’s true range. This is the greatest of
 The current high less the current low.
 The absolute value of the current high less the previous close.
 The absolute value of the current low less the previous close.
225
Chapter 13: Market Indicators and Day Trading Strategies

Calculate those three numbers, then take the highest of them and average it
with the true range for the past 14 days. 
Each day’s true range number shows you just how much the security swung
between the high and the low, or how much the high or the low that day
varied from the previous day’s close. It’s a measure of how much volatility
occurred each day. When averaged over time, it shows how much volatility
takes place over time. The higher the average true range, the more volatile a
security is.
Beta
Beta is the covariance (that is, the statistical measure of how much two 
variables move together) of a stock relative to the rest of the market. The
number comes from the Capital Assets Pricing Model, which is an equation
used in academic circles to model the performance of securities. Traders
don’t use the Capital Assets Pricing Model, but they often talk about beta to
evaluate the volatility of stocks and options. 
What does beta mean? 
 A beta of one means that the security moves at a faster rate than the
market. You would buy high betas if you think the market is going up,
but not if the market is going down.
 A beta of less than one means that the security moves more slowly than
the market. This is good if you want less risk than the market.
 A beta of exactly one means that the security moves at the same rate as
the market.
 A negative beta means that the security moves in the opposite direction
of the market. The easiest way to get a negative beta security is to short
(borrow and then sell) a positive beta security.
VIX
VIX is short for the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index. The 
calculation of it is complex enough to border on being proprietary, but it is
available on many quotation systems and on the exchange’s Web site, www.
cboe.com/micro/vix/introduction.aspx.
The VIX is based on the implied volatility of options on stocks included in 
the S&P 500 Index. The greater the volatility, the more uncertainty investors
have, and the more options that show great volatility, the more widespread
the concern is within the market. Hence, some consider the VIX to be a gauge
of market fear. The greater the VIX, the more bearish the outlook for the
market in general.
226
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

Traders can use the VIX to help them value options and futures on the
market indexes. (For that matter, traders who want to take a position on
market volatility can use option contracts on the VIX offered by the Chicago
Board Options Exchange.) The VIX can also be used to help confirm bullish
or bearish sentiment that shows up in other market signals, such as the tick
or the on-balance volume measures described earlier. 
In addition to the VIX, the exchange also tracks the VXN (volatility on the
NASDAQ 100 Index) and the VXD (volatility on the Dow Jones Industrial
Average.)
Volatility ratio
The volatility ratio tells traders what the implied volatility of a security is rela-
tive to the recent historical volatility. It shows if the security is expected to
be more or less volatile right now than it has been in the past, and it’s widely
used in option markets. The first calculation required is the implied volatility,
which is backed out using the Black-Scholes model, an academic model for
valuing options. When you plug in time until expiration, interest rates, divi-
dends, stock price, and strike price to the model, the implied volatility is the
volatility number that then generates the current option price. (You don’t
have to do this yourself, as most quotation systems generate implied volatil-
ity for you.)
Once you have the implied volatility, you can compare it to the historical
volatility of the option, which tells you just how much the price changed over
the last 20 or 90 days. If the implied volatility is greater than the statistical
volatility, the market may be overestimating the uncertainty in the prices,
and the options may be overvalued. And, if the implied volatility is much less
than the statistical volatility, the market may be underestimating uncertainty,
so the options may be undervalued.
Measuring Money Flows
Money flows tell you how much money is going into or out of a market. They
are another set of indicators that tell you where the market sentiment is right
now and where it might be going soon. They combine features of price and
volume indicators to help traders gauge the market. Although amounts spent
to buy and sell have to match — otherwise, there would be no market — the
enthusiasm of the buyers and the anxiousness of the sellers shows up in the
volume traded and the direction of the price change. Just how hard was it for
the buyers to get the sellers to part with their positions? And, how hard will
it be to get them to part with their positions tomorrow? That’s the informa-
tion contained in money flow indicators.
227
Chapter 13: Market Indicators and Day Trading Strategies

The most basic money flow indicator is closing price multiplied by the
number of shares traded. If the closing price was higher than the closing
price yesterday, then the number is positive; if the closing price today was
lower than the price yesterday, then the number is negative.
Accumulation/distribution index
In trading terms, accumulation is controlled buying, and distribution is con-
trolled selling. This is the kind of buying and selling that doesn’t lead to big
changes in securities prices, and it’s usually because the action was planned.
No one accumulates or distributes a security in a state of panic.
But even if the buying and selling activity isn’t driven by madcap rushes in
and out of positions, it’s still important to know whether, on balance, the
buyers or the sellers have the slight predominance in the market, because
that may affect the direction of in the near future. For example, if a security
has been in an upward trend, but there are more and more down days with
increasing volume, that means that the sellers are starting to dominate the
trading and that the price trend is likely to go down. 
Here’s the equation:
Accumulation/distribution = ((Close – Low) – (High –
Close)) / (High – Low) × Period’s volume
Some traders look at accumulation/distribution from day to day, whereas
others prefer to look at it for a week or even a month’s worth of trading. 
Money flow ratio and money flow index
Money flow is closing price multiplied by the number of shares traded. That
basic statistic can be manipulated in strange and wonderful ways to generate
new statistics carrying even more information about whether the markets are
likely to have more buying pressure or more selling pressure in the future.
The first is the money flow ratio. This is simply the total money flow for those
days where prices were up from the prior day (days with positive money
flow), divided by the total money flow for those days where prices were
down from the prior day (which are the days with negative money flow). Day
traders tend to calculate money flow ratios for short time periods, such as a
week or ten days, while swing traders and investors tend to care about longer
time periods, like a month or even four months of trading.
228
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

The money flow ratio is sometimes converted into the money flow index,
which can be used as a single indicator or tracked relative to prices for a
given period of time. This equation looks like Figure 13-3.
If the money flow index is more than 80, the security is usually considered to
be overbought — meaning that the buyers are done buying, and the sellers
will put downward pressure on prices. If the money flow index is less than 20,
then the security is usually considered to be oversold, and the buyers will
soon take over and drive prices up. In between, the money flow index can
help clarify information from other market indicators. 
Short interest ratios
Short selling is a way to make money if a security falls in price. In the options
and futures markets, one simply agrees to sell a contract to someone else. In
the stock and bond markets, it’s a little more complicated. The short seller
borrows stock or bonds through the brokerage firm, and then sells them.
Ideally, the price will fall, and then the trader can buy back the stock or bonds
at the lower price to repay the loan. The trader keeps the difference between
the price where the security was sold and the price where the security was
repurchased. (The process is described in more detail in Chapter 14.)
People take the short side of a position for only one reason: They think that
prices are going to go down. They may want to hedge against this, or they
may want to make a big profit if it happens. In the stock market in particular,
monitoring the rate of short selling can give clues to investor expectations
and future market direction.
The New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ report the short interest in
stocks listed with them. The data are updated monthly, as it can take a while
for brokerage firms to sort out exactly how many shares have been shorted
and then report that data to the exchanges. The resulting number, the short
interest ratio, tells the number of shares that have been shorted, the percentage

Chapter 13: Market Indicators and Day Trading Strategies

change from the month before, the average daily trading volume in the same
month, and the number of days of trading at the average volume that it would
take to cover the short positions.
The loans that enable short selling have to be repaid. If the lender asks for
them back, or if prices go up so that the position starts to lose money, the
trader is going to have to buy shares in order to make repayment. The harder
it is to get the right number of shares in the market, the more desperate the
trader will become, and the higher prices will go.
An increase in short interest shows that investors are becoming nervous
about a stock. However, given that short interest is not calculated frequently,
the number would probably not give a trader a lot of information about the
prospects for the company itself. This doesn’t mean short interest doesn’t
carry a lot of useful information for traders. It does. If the short interest is
high, then the security price is likely to go up when all the people who are
short need to buy back stock. Likewise, if short interest is low, there will be
little buying pressure in the near future.
High short interest, along with other bullish indicators, is a sign that prices
are more likely to go up than down in the near future.
Information Cropping up 
During the Trading Day
Technical analysis (described in Chapter 12) and all the indicators discussed
in this chapter offer useful information about what’s happening in the mar-
kets, but there’s one problem: Because so many of those indicators are based
on closing prices and closing volume, they aren’t much use during the trad-
ing day. And in fact, many traders read through the information in the morn-
ing before the open to sort out what is likely to happen and what the mood of
the market is likely to be, but then they have to recalibrate their gauge of the
market as information comes to them during the trading day. That informa-
tion doesn’t show up on charts or in neat numerical indicators until the day
ends. But there are several sources of information that are updated while the
market is open to give a trader a sense of what’s happening at any given time.
Price, time, and sales
The most important information for a trader is the current price of the security,
how often and in what volume it has been trading, and how much the price has
moved from the last trade. This is the most basic real-time information out
there, and it’s readily available through a brokerage firm’s quotation screens.
230
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

In Chapter 6 there is a discussion of the different quotation services that
traders can obtain from their brokerage firms. Although your broker may
charge you more to get more detailed quotes, it’s worth it for most trading
strategies. Knowing how the price is moving can give you a sense of whether
the general mood of the market is being confirmed or contradicted. That can
help you place more profitable trades.
Order book
High-level price quote data, such as that available through NASDAQ Level II
or NASDAQ TotalView, include information on who is placing orders and just
how large those orders are. (Refer to Chapter 6 to see what this looks like.)
The book gives you key data, because it gives you a sense of how smart the
other buyers and sellers are. Are they day traders just trying not to be killed?
Or are they institutions that have done a lot of research and are under a lot of
performance pressure? Sure, day traders are often very right and institutions
are often very wrong, but the information you see in the order book can help
you sense whether people are trading on information or on emotion.
An additional piece of information from the order book can help you figure
out what’s happening in the market now — namely, the presence of an order
imbalance. An order imbalance means that the number of buyers and sellers
don’t match. This often happens during the open, because some traders
prefer to place orders before the market opens, whereas others prefer to wait
until after the open. These imbalances tend to be small and clear up quickly.
However, if a major news event takes place, or there’s a great deal of fear in
the market, large imbalances can occur during the trading day. These can be
disruptive, and in some cases the exchange stops trading until news is dis-
seminated and enough new orders are placed to balance out the orders.
News flows
Although much of the discussion in this chapter has been about the informa-
tion contained in price, volume, and other trade data, the actual information
that comes from news releases is at least as important. 
Much of the news is regularly scheduled and much predicted: corporate earn-
ings, Federal Reserve discount rates, unemployment rates, housing starts,
and the like. When this information comes in, traders want to know how the
actual results compare with what was expected, and how this fits with the
overall bullish or bearish sentiment of the market. 
231
Chapter 13: Market Indicators and Day Trading Strategies

The second type of news is the unscheduled breaking event, such as corpo-
rate takeovers, horrible storms, political assassinations, or other happenings
that were not expected and that take more time for the market to digest.
That’s in part because these events have the ability to change trends rather
than play out against them. In some cases, the markets will halt trading to
allow this information to disseminate; in others, traders have to react quickly
based on what they know now and what they suspect will happen in the near
future.
What’s the difference between risk and uncertainty? Risk is something that
happens often enough that people can quantify the damage. Uncertainty is
something that might happen, but no one can figure out the likelihood. A fire
that knocks out power to Midtown Manhattan sometime in the next ten years
is a risk; the invasion of the planet by aliens from outer space is uncertainty.
News can happen at any time. It can change a trend and throw all your care-
ful analysis into disarray. That’s why careful analysis is no substitute for risk
management. Watch your position sizes and have stops in place so that you
exit when you need to. Chapter 2 has a lot of information on these topics.
Anomalies and Traps
Traders can be superstitious, and that shows up in different anomalies and
traps that affect the mood of the market even if there is no logical reason for
their existence. You want to be aware of them, because they can affect trad-
ing, even if there doesn’t seem to be a justification for them. 
An anomaly is a market condition that occurs regularly, but for no good
reason. It can be related to the month of the year, the day of the week, or the
size of the company involved.
A trap is a situation where the market doesn’t perform the way you expect it
to given the indicators that you are looking at. You have a choice: Go with
what the market is telling you, or go with what your indicators are telling you.
To a long-term investor, perception is perception. When it’s different from
reality, there’s an opportunity to make money. To a short-term trader, percep-
tion is reality, because that affects what happens before everyone figures out
what’s real.
232
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

Bear traps and bull traps
Traders talk about getting caught in traps, which neatly fits the language 
of bulls and bears. When this happens, they are stuck moving against the
market, and that causes them big trouble. After all, day trading is about iden-
tifying trends and moving with them, because you only have a few hours to
work before it’s time to close out. In this section, I list a few common traps to
help you identify them and, I hope, avoid them.
The best antidote for a trap is to take your loss and move on to the next trade. 
Chart traps
If you go back to Chapter 12 and look at some of the sample charts, and if you
look at actual price charts created in the market every day, you might notice
that sometimes, it’s really hard to tell whether a breakout is false or real,
whether a trend is changing or just playing out with a smaller subtrend. A 
ton of subjectivity goes into reading charts, and some days you’ll read them
wrong. You’ll be thinking that you are ahead of the market when you’ve actu-
ally just traded against it. Ouch!
Some traders try to work around this by automating their trading. Several dif-
ferent software packages will scan the market and identify potential trading
opportunities (see Chapter 7 for more information.) But even the best soft-
ware will misread the market on some occasions. That’s why you need to
monitor your positions and make sure you stick to your loss limits.
Contrarian traps
Way back in Chapter 1, I noted that about 80 percent of day traders lose
money. So maybe you’re thinking that the way to make money is to just do
the opposite of what everyone else is doing. But the reason that they lose
money isn’t so much that they are wrong about the trend, it’s that they are
sloppy in their trading and don’t limit their losses. (That’s why so much of
this book is about the business of trading, rather than the actual mechanics
of placing buy and sell orders.) 
In a contrarian trap, the trader has made the decision to trade against the
market, and that’s exactly what happens: He or she loses money because 
the market is moving in the opposite direction. Taking a contrary position
doesn’t work too well in day trading. In most cases, you have to go with the
flow, not against it, to make money in a single day’s session. The market is
always right in the short term.
233
Chapter 13: Market Indicators and Day Trading Strategies

Calendar effects
Many trading anomalies follow time periods. That’s not completely unexpected,
as many economic and business trends follow the calendar. Companies report
their results quarterly. Most close their books for tax purposes at the end of the
year. Investors are also evaluated quarterly. Retail sales follow holiday seasons,
demand for commodities follows the growing season, and fuel demand varies
with the weather. Whatever you decided to trade, you need to do enough funda-
mental research (the study of the business and economic factors that affect the
security, described in Chapter 12) so that you know how your chosen securities
move over time.
But some of the calendar effects make little logical sense, yet they influence
trading. Hence, this explanation of the January effect, the Monday effect, and
the October effect.
The January effect
Many years, the stock market goes up in the early part of January. Why? No
one is entirely sure, but the guess is that people tend to sell at the end of
December for tax reasons, and then buy back those securities in January. It
may also be that in the new year, everyone is flush with excitement and ready
to see the market go up, so they put money to work and start buying.
If stocks go up in January, then you can get a jump on the market by buying
in December, right? And that would make prices go up in December. To get a
jump on the December rally, you could buy in November. And that’s exactly
what people started to do, and the once-pronounced January effect is now
weak to non-existent. (People still talk about it, though.) In an efficient
market, people will eventually figure out these unexplained phenomena, then
trade on them until they disappear. Use these anomalies as a way to gauge
psychology, not as hard and fast trading rules.
The Monday effect
The market seems to do more poorly on Monday than on the other days 
of the week. And no matter what the evidence shows (and the research is
ambiguous and the findings vary greatly based on the time period and the
markets examined), many traders believe this, so it has an effect. Why? There
are two thoughts. The first is that everyone is in a bad mood on Monday
because they have to go back to work after the weekend. The second is that
people spend all weekend analyzing any bad news from the end of the prior
week, then sell as soon as they get back to the office.
234
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

The October effect
The stock market has had two grand crashes and one smaller but profound
one, all in October. On October 29, 1929, a day known as Black Tuesday, the
Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 12 percent in one day as market spec-
ulators caught up with the less rosy reality of the economy. This crash kicked
off a general decline that contributed to the Great Depression of the 1930s.
On October 19, 1987, known as Black Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average declined 23 percent. No one is really sure why it happened, but it
did. Then, on October 13, 1989, the Dow Jones declined 7 percent in the last
hour of trading when a leveraged buyout for United Airlines fell through. 
Because of these crashes, many traders believe that bad things happen in
October, and they act accordingly. Of course, bad things happen in other
months. The crash in the NASDAQ market that marked the end of the 1990s
tech bubble took place in March of 2000, but no one talks about a March effect.

n a certain sense, day trading isn’t risky at all. Day traders close out their
positions overnight to minimize the possibility of something going wrong
while the trader isn’t paying attention. Each trade is based on finding a small
price change in the market over a short period of time, so it’s unlikely that
anything is going to change dramatically. But here’s the thing: Trading this
way leads to small returns. It’s hard to justify trading full time if you aren’t
making a lot of money when you do it, no matter how low your risk is.
And, of course, some days, there aren’t many good trades to make. You can
be looking for securities to go up, and they aren’t. Zero trades lead to zero
risk, and zero return.
That’s why savvy traders think about other ways to make money on their
trades, even if it involves taking on more risk. It’s that risk that generates the
return that many traders crave. In this chapter, I cover two techniques for
finding trades and increasing returns: short selling and leverage. Both involve
borrowing, also known as leverage, and both increase risk.
Taking Other People’s Money 
to Make Money
The dollars you make from trading depend on two things: your percentage
return on your trades and the dollars you have to start out with. If you
double your money but only have a $1,000 account, then you are left with
$2,000. If you get a 10 percent return but have a $1,000,000 account, then you

make $100,000. Which would you rather have? (Yes, I know, you’d rather
double your money with the $1,000,000 account. But I didn’t give you that
choice, alas.) 
The point is that the more money you have to trade, the more dollars you
can generate, even if the return on the trade itself is small. If you have
$500,000 and borrow $500,000 more, then your 10 percent return will give you
$100,000 to take home, not $50,000. You have doubled the dollars returned to
you by doubling the money you used to place the trades, not by doubling the
performance of the trade itself. Clever, huh?
Leverage gives you more money to trade. That helps you generate more dol-
lars for your account — or lose more dollars, if you aren’t careful or have a
string of reversals. 
When you borrow money or shares of stock, you have to pay it back, no
matter what happens. That’s why borrowing can be risky.
Why leverage is important 
in short-term trading
Day traders and other short-term traders aren’t looking to make big money
on any single trade. Instead, the goal is to make small money on a whole
bunch of trades. Unfortunately, it can be hard for all those little trades to 
add up to something big. That’s why many day traders turn to leverage. 
They either borrow money or stock from their brokerage firm, or they trade
securities that have built-in leverage, such as futures and foreign exchange. 
The fine print on margin agreements
Leverage not only adds risk to your own account, it adds risk to the entire
financial system. If everyone borrowed money and then some big market 
catastrophe happened, then no one would be able to repay their loans, and
those who lent the money would go bust, too. 
As a result, there’s an incredible amount of oversight that goes with leverage
strategies. The Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, the different exchanges, and even the U.S. Treasury
Department regulate how much money a trader can borrow. Many brokerage
firms have even stricter rules in place as part of their risk management, and
they are expected to demonstrate to the National Association of Securities
Dealers and the National Futures Association that they follow their practices.

Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

This means you have about as much flexibility when you borrow from your
broker in order to buy and sell securities as you would have if you borrowed
from your friendly neighborhood loan shark to play a high-stakes poker
game. Meaning: not much. Margin loans are highly regulated, and you must
meet the broker’s terms. If you fail to repay the loan, your positions will be
sold from underneath you. If you try to borrow too much, you will be cut off.
No amount of begging and pleading will help you.
Your brokerage firm makes you sign a margin agreement, which says that you
understand the risks and limits of your activities. You probably can’t have a
margin account unless you meet a minimum account size, maybe $10,000 or
more, and the amount you can borrow depends on the size of your account.
Generally, a stock or bond account must hold 50 percent of the purchase
price of securities when you borrow the money. The price of those securities
can go down, but if they go down so much that the account now holds only
25 percent of the value of the loan, you’ll get a margin call. (Some brokers will
call in loans faster than others; their policies are disclosed in their margin
agreements.) 
Brokerage firms handle margin trades all the time. You do the paperwork
once, when you sign a margin agreement. Each time you place an order,
you’re asked if you are making the trade with cash or on margin. Click the
“Margin” box, and you’ve just borrowed money. It’s that easy.
Managing margin calls
If the value of your account starts falling, and it looks like it is falling below
the 25 percent maintenance margin limit, you’ll get a margin call. Your broker
will call you and ask you to deposit more money in your account. If you can’t
do that, the broker will start selling your securities to close out the loan. And
if you don’t have enough to pay off the loan, the broker will close your
account and put a lien, which is a claim on your assets, against you.
Most brokerage firms have risk-management limits in place, so you’ll proba-
bly get plenty of warning before you get a margin call or see your account
closed out. After all, neither you nor your brokerage firm wants to lose
money. Just keep in mind that it’s a possibility.
At least one brokerage firm advertises that, as a service to you, it will close
out your account as soon as you lose the amount in it, to keep you from
losing more money. It’s as much a service to the brokerage as it is to you, but
it’s an example of the built-in risk management that firms have to limit risks
to everyone. 
239
Chapter 14: Short Selling and Leverage

Margin bargains for day traders only
Day traders are often able to avoid margin calls because they borrow money
for such short periods of time. Good day traders look for small market moves
and cut their losses early on, which minimizes the risk of using other
people’s money. And, by definition, day traders close out their positions
every night. 
If you qualify as a pattern day trader, you get two benefits. First, your broker-
age firm probably won’t charge you any interest as long as you do not hold a
margin loan balance overnight. Second, you may be allowed to borrow more
than 50 percent of the purchase price of securities. Some firms allow pattern
day traders to borrow 75 percent or more of their trade value.
The New York Stock Exchange and National Association of Securities Dealers
define a pattern day trader as one with a margin account holding at least
$25,000. This trader must also buy then sell, or sell short then buy, the same
security on the same day four or more times in five business days. The number
of day trades should be more than six percent of the customer’s total trading
activity for that same five-day period.

Part III: Day Trading Strategies 
The dangers of risk: Long-Term Capital Management
Leverage adds risk to low-risk strategies, which
increases returns as long as nothing goes
wrong. But sometimes things go horribly wrong,
even for the big guys. In 1998, Long-Term Capital
Management, a hedge fund formed by several
leading traders and academics (including a few
Nobel Prize winners), failed.
The fund’s basic trading style had very little risk.
Its traders looked for small price differences
between bonds that were expected to go away.
(This is known as arbitrage and is discussed in
Chapter 15.) To generate big money, the fund
borrowed tons of money, which turned that low-
risk strategy into a risky one. In the summer of
1998, the Russian government defaulted on its
bonds. Investors panicked and traded their
European and Japanese bonds for U.S. govern-
ment bonds.
Long-Term Capital Management had bet that
small differences in price between the U.S.
bonds and the overseas ones would disappear;
instead, the concern over Russia’s problems
caused the small price differences to get bigger.
Much bigger. This made it difficult for Long-
Term Capital Management’s managers to repay
the money that the fund had borrowed, which
put pressure on the banks and brokerage firms
that had given the loans. The Federal Reserve
Bank organized a restructuring plan with the
banks that were owed money by Long-Term
Capital Management in order to prevent a mas-
sive financial catastrophe. In total, Long-Term
Capital Management lost $4.6 billion dollars.

Short Selling 
Traditionally, investors and traders want to buy low and sell high. They buy a
position in a security and then wait for the price to go up. It’s not a bad way
to make money, especially because if the country’s economy continues to
grow even a little bit, then businesses are going to grow and so are their
stocks. 
But even in a good economy, some securities go down. The company may 
be mismanaged, it may sell a product that’s out of favor, or maybe it’s just
having a string of bad days. For that matter, maybe it went up a little too
much in price, and now investors are coming to their senses. In these situa-
tions, you can’t make money buying low and selling high. If only there were a
way to reverse the situation.
Well, there is a way — selling short. And in short — hah! — selling short
means that you borrow a security and then sell it in hopes of repaying the
loan of the shares by buying back cheaper shares later on.
In trading lingo, when you own something, you are considered to be long.
When you sell it, you are considered to be short. You don’t have to be long
before you go short. 
How to sell short
Most brokerage firms make it easy to sell short. You simply place an order to
sell the stock, and the broker asks whether you are selling shares that you
own or selling short. Once you place the order, the brokerage firm goes about
borrowing shares for you to sell. It loans the shares to your account and exe-
cutes the sell order.
You can’t sell short unless the brokerage firm is able to borrow the shares.
Sometimes, so many people have sold a stock short that there are no shares
to borrow. If that’s the case, you’ll have to find another stock or another
strategy this time.
Once the shares are sold, you wait until the security goes down in price, then
you buy the shares in the market at a bargain. These purchased shares are
then returned to the broker to pay the loan, and you keep the difference
between where you sold and where you bought — less interest, of course.
241
Chapter 14: Short Selling and Leverage

The stock exchanges are in the business of helping companies raise money,
so they have rules in place to help maintain an upward bias in the stock
market. That can work against the short seller. The key regulation is what’s
called the uptick rule, which means you can only sell a stock short when the
last trade was a move up. You can’t short a stock that’s moving down.
Figure 14-1 shows how short selling works. The trader borrows 400 shares
selling at $25 each and then sells them. If the stock goes down, she can buy
back the shares at the lower price, making a tidy profit. If the stock stays flat,
she loses money because the broker will charge her interest based on the
value of the shares she borrowed. And if the stock price goes up, she not only
loses money on the interest expense, but she is also out on her investment.
The interest and fees that the broker charges those who borrow stock accrue
to the broker, not to the person who actually owns the stock. In fact, the
stock’s owner will probably never know that his shares were loaned out.
Choosing shorts
Investors — those people who do careful research and expect to be in their
positions for months or even years — look for companies that have inflated
expectations and are possibly fraudulent. Investors who work the short side
of the market spend hours, usually doing careful accounting research, look-
ing for companies that are likely to go down in price some day.
Day traders don’t care about accounting. They don’t have the time to wait for
a short to work out. Instead, they are looking for stocks that go down in price
for more mundane reasons, like more sellers than buyers in the next ten min-
utes. Most day traders who sell short simply reverse their long strategy. For
example, some day traders like to buy stocks that have gone down for three
days in a row, figuring that they’ll go up on the fourth day. They’ll also short
stocks that have gone up three days in a row, figuring that they’ll go down on
the fourth day. You don’t need a CPA to do that!
Trading strategies are covered in more detail in Chapters 12 and 13, if you are
looking for some ideas.

Short squeezes and other risks
Shorting stocks carries certain risks, because a short sale is a bet on things
going wrong. In theory, there’s no limit on how much a stock can go up, so
there is no limit on how much money a short seller can lose. Two traps in
particular can get a short seller. The first is a short squeeze due to good
news, the second is a concerted effort to hurt those who are short.
Squeeze my shorts
With a short squeeze, a company that has been popular with a lot of short
sellers has some good news that drives the stock price up. When the price
goes up, short sellers lose money, and some may even have margin problems.
And the original reason for going short may be proven to be wrong. Those
who are short start buying the stock back in order to reduce their losses, 
but their increased demand drives the stock price even higher, causing even
bigger losses for those who are still short. Ouch!
Calling back the stock
All is not sweetness and light in the world of short selling. Many market par-
ticipants distrust those folks who are doing all the careful research, in part
because they are often right. Company executives are often optimists who
don’t like to hear bad news, and they’ll blame short sellers for all that is
wrong with their stock price.
Meanwhile, some short sellers have been known to get impatient if their sale
isn’t making money and start spreading ugly rumors. Many companies, bro-
kers, and investors hate short sellers and try tactics to bust them. Sometimes
they issue good news or spread rumors of good news to create a squeeze.
Other times, they collectively ask holders of the stock to request that their
brokerage firm not loan out their shares. This means that those who shorted
it have to buy back and return the shares even if it makes no sense to do so.
Lots to Discover About Leverage
Leverage is the use of borrowed money to increase returns. Day traders use it
a lot to get bigger returns from relatively small price changes in the underly-
ing securities. And as long as they consistently close their positions out at
the end of the day, day traders can borrow more money and pay less interest
than people who hold securities for a longer term. 
243
Chapter 14: Short Selling and Leverage

The process of borrowing works differently in different markets. In the stock
and bond markets, it’s straightforward. You just tell your broker you’re bor-
rowing when you place the order. In the options and futures markets, you’re
buying and selling contracts that have leverage built into them. You don’t
borrow money outright, but you can control a lot of value in your account for
relatively little money down. 
In stock and bond markets
Leverage is straightforward for buyers of stocks and bonds: You simply click
the box marked “Margin” when you place your order, and the brokerage firm
loans you money. (The margin process is defined in more detail earlier in the
chapter.) Then, when the security goes up in price, you get a greater percent-
age return because you’ve been able to buy more for your money. Of course,
that also increases your potential losses.
Figure 14-2 shows how it works. The trader borrows money to buy 400 shares
of SuperCorp. If the stock goes up 4 percent, she makes 8 percent. Whoo-
hooo! But if the stock goes down 4 percent, she still has to repay the loan at
full dollar value, so she ends up losing 8 percent. That’s not so good.
If you hold your margin position overnight or longer, you’ll have to start
paying interest. That will cut into your returns or increase your losses.
In options markets
An option gives you the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock or
other item at a set price when the contract expires. A call option gives you
the right to buy, so you would buy a call if you think the underlying asset is
going up. A put option gives you the right to sell, so you would buy a put if

you think the underlying asset is going down. (You can read more about
options in Chapter 3, if you are so inspired.) By trading an option, you get
exposure to changes in the price of the underlying security without actually
buying the security itself. That’s the source of the leverage in the market.
A day trader might use options to get an exposure to price changes in a stock
for a lot less money than it would cost to buy the stock itself. Suppose a call
option is deeply in-the-money. That means that its strike price, the price that
you would be able to buy the stock at if you exercised the option, is far below
the current stock price. If this happens, the obvious thing is for the option
price to be set at the difference between the current stock price and the strike
price, and that’s more or less what happens: more in theory, less in practice.
When the stock price changes, the option price changes at almost exactly the
same amount. This means that you can buy the price performance of the
stock at a discount, the discount being the strike price of the stock.
Figure 14-3 shows the performance-boosting leverage from this strategy. The
trader buys call options with an exercise price of $10 on a stock trading at
$25. The option price changes the same amount that the stock price does,
but the call holder gets a greater percentage return than the stock holder.
There are many other options strategies that day traders can use, but a dis-
cussion of them goes beyond the scope of this book. The Appendix has some
resources to help you in your research.
In futures trading
A futures contract gives you the obligation to buy or sell an underlying finan-
cial or agricultural commodity, assuming you still hold the contract at the
expiration date. That underlying product ranges from the value of treasury

bonds to barrels of oil and heads of cattle, and you’re only putting money
down now when you purchase the contract. You don’t have to come up with
the full amount until the contract comes due — and almost all options and
futures traders close out their trades long before the contract expiration
date. Futures are discussed in Chapter 3, but here I talk about how leverage
works in the futures market. 
Although most options and futures contracts settle with cash long before the
due date, contract holders have the right to hold them until the due date and,
in the case of options on common stock and agricultural derivatives, demand
physical delivery. It’s rare, but the commodity exchanges have systems in
place for determining the transport, specifications, and delivery of grain,
cattle, or ethanol. One advantage of day trading is that you close out the same
day, without ever even thinking about the fine print of physical delivery.
Because derivatives have built-in leverage that allows a trader to have big
market exposure for relatively few dollars up front, they’ve become popular
with day traders. Figure 14-4 shows how it works. Here, a trader is buying the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s E-Mini S&P 500 futures contract, which gives
traders exposure to the performance of the Standard and Poor’s 500 Index, a
standard measure of the stock performance of a diversified list of 500 large
American companies. The futures contract trades at 50 times the value of the
index, rounded to the nearest $0.25. The minimum margin that a trader must
put down on the contract is $3,500. Each $0.25 change in the index leads to a
$12.50 ($0.25 × 50) change in the value of the contract, and that $12.50 is
added to or subtracted from the $3,500 margin.
Some exchanges use the term margin, and others prefer to use performance
bond. Either way, it’s the same thing: money you put in up front to ensure that
you can meet the contract terms when it comes due. If you hold the contract
overnight, your account is adjusted up or down to reflect the day’s profits. If
it gets too low, you’re asked to add more money.
A day trader buys a Chicago Mercantile Exchange E-Mini S&P 500 futures contract.
The contract price is $50 x the index level. To buy it, the trader must post margin of $3,500

Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

In foreign exchange
The foreign exchange, or forex, market is driven by leverage. Exchange rates
tend to move slowly, by as little as a tenth or even a hundredth of a penny 
a day. And the markets are so huge that it’s easier to hedge risk. You might
have trouble borrowing shares of stock to short them, but you should have
no trouble ever borrowing yen. In order to get a big return, forex traders
almost always borrow huge amounts of money.
In the stock market, day traders can borrow up to three times the amount 
of cash and securities held in their accounts (although not all firms will let
you borrow the statutory maximum), and that amount is set by outside regu-
latory organizations. In the forex market, there is no regulation on lending,
and some forex firms will allow traders to borrow as much as 400 times the
amount in their accounts. 
Forex firms allow such huge borrowing because they can hedge their risks, so
that if you lose money, they make money. If you sell dollars to buy euros, the
firm can easily go in and sell euros to buy dollars. That makes its position net
neutral. If the euro goes down relative to the dollar, you’ve lost money, but
the firm can offset its risk because its counter-trade went up. 
The reason that a forex firm wants to hedge its risks against its day trading
customers is that most day traders lose money. The firms know that if they
bet against the aggregate trades held by their customers, they’ll probably
come out ahead. Don’t trade in forex or any other market until you’ve worked
out a strategy and practiced it, so that you can avoid becoming a statistic.
Chapter 11 has information on testing and evaluating trading strategies.
Figure 14-5 shows how leverage in foreign exchange makes good returns pos-
sible. Here, the trader starts with a $1,000 account and borrows the maxi-
mum amount the forex firms allow, $400 for each dollar in the account. All
$401,000 are put to work buying euros. Note that the euro value stays con-
stant, but the dollar value of those euros changes by hundredths of a penny.
Thanks to leverage, the return is 11 percent — not bad for a day’s trading! Of
course, you could lose 11 percent, which wouldn’t be so good.

Borrowing in Your Trading Business
Leverage is only part of the borrowing involved in your day trading business.
Like any business owner, sometimes you need more cash than your business
generates. Other times, you see expansion opportunities that require more
money than you have on hand. In this section, I discuss why and how day
traders can borrow money over and above leveraged trading. 
Margin loans for cash flow
If day trading is your job, then you face a constant pressure: How do you
cover the costs of living while keeping enough money in the market to trade?
One way to do this is to have another source of income — from savings, a
spouse, or a job that doesn’t overlap with market hours. Other day traders
take money out of their trading account.
If the market hasn’t been cooperative, then there might not be enough to take
out of the account while still having enough capital to trade. One option is to
arrange a margin loan through a brokerage firm. The firm will let you take out
a loan against the securities that you hold. You can spend the money any way
you like, but you will be charged interest — and you will have to repay it.
Still, it’s a good option to have, because day trade earnings tend to be erratic.
Borrowing for trading capital
Some day traders use a double layer of leverage: They borrow the money 
to set up their trading accounts and then they borrow money for their trad-
ing strategies. If the market cooperates, this can be a great way to make
money, but if not, you could end up owing a lot of people money that you
don’t have. 
If you want to take the risk, though, you have a few resources to turn to other
than your relatives: You can borrow against your house, use your credit
cards, or find a trading firm that will give you some money to work with.
Borrowing against your house
Yes, you can use a mortgage or a home equity line of credit to get the money
for your day trading activities. In general, this carries low interest rates
248
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

because your house is your collateral. In most cases, though, the interest 
will not be tax deductible (ask your accountant, but generally, you can only
deduct interest used to purchase or improve your house). Still, it can be a 
relatively low-cost way to pull value stored in your house for use in trading.
The risk? If you can’t pay back the loan, you can lose your residence. Just
don’t borrow against your car, too, as you’ll need a place to live when the
bank evicts you.
Putting it on the card
The business world is filled with people who started businesses using credit
cards. And you can do that. If you have even halfway decent credit, credit
card companies are happy to lend you all the money you want.
Naturally, they charge you a mighty high rate of interest, one that even the
sharpest traders will have trouble covering from their returns. If the only way
you can raise the capital for day trading is through your credit card, consider
waiting a few years and saving your money before taking the plunge. Because
day trading income can be erratic, you may end up using your credit cards to
cover your living expenses some months. You may want to save your credit
for that rather than dedicate it directly for your day trading. 
Risk capital from an arcade
In Chapters 6 and 7, I discuss trading arcades, office spaces where traders can
rent space. These are usually located in major cities near established stock,
bond, options, and futures exchanges. Some trading arcades offer more than
just desk space. Some have training programs, whereas others give promising
traders some capital to trade in exchange for a cut of the profits. This may be
an option for you to consider if you are new to day trading and want to put
more money to work than you currently have available.
Assessing Risks and Returns from 
Short Selling and Leverage
Leverage introduces risk to your day trading, and that can give you greatly
increased returns. Most day traders use leverage, at least part of the time, in
order to make their trading activities pay off in cold, hard cash. The challenge
is to use leverage responsibly. Chapter 9 goes into money management in
great detail, but here I cover the two issues most related to leverage: losing
your money, and losing your nerve. Understanding those risks can help you
determine how much leverage you should take, and how often you can take it.
249
Chapter 14: Short Selling and Leverage

Losing your money
Losing money is obvious. Leverage magnifies your returns, but it also magni-
fies your risks. Any borrowings have to be repaid regardless. If you buy or
sell a futures or options contract, you are legally obligated to perform, even 
if you have lost money. That can be really hard. Day trading is risky in large
part because of the amount of leverage used. If you don’t feel comfortable
with that, you may want to use little or no leverage, especially when you are
new to day trading or when you are starting to work a new trading strategy. 
Losing your nerve
The basic risk and return of your underlying strategy isn’t affected by lever-
age. If you expect that your system will work about 60 percent of the time,
then that should hold no matter how much money is at stake or where that
money came from. However, it’s likely that it does make a difference to you
on some subconscious level if you have borrowed the money.
Trading is very much a game of nerves. If you hesitate to make a trade, cut 
a loss, or otherwise follow your strategy, you’re going to run into trouble.
(Chapter 8 discusses the mental aspects of day trading.)
Let’s say you are trading futures and decide to accept three downticks before
selling, and that you will look for five upticks before selling. This means you
are willing to accept some loss, cut it if it gets out of hand, and then be disci-
plined about taking gains when you get them. This strategy keeps a lid on
your losses while forcing some discipline on your gains.
Now, suppose you are dealing with lots and lots of leverage. Suddenly, those
downticks become too real to you — it’s money you don’t have. Next thing
you know, you only accept two downticks before closing out. But this keeps
you from getting winners. Then you decide to ride with your winners, and
suddenly you aren’t taking profits fast enough, and your positions move
against you. Your fear of loss is making you sloppy. That’s why many traders
find it better to borrow less money and stick to their system, rather than
borrow the maximum allowed and let that knowledge cloud their judgment.
Lenders can lose their nerve, too. Your brokerage firm might close your
account because of losses, even though waiting just a little longer might turn
a losing position into a profit. (See the earlier sidebar “The dangers of risk:
Long-Term Capital Management.”) That fund was shut by lenders worried
about not being repaid. There’s some evidence that if the fund had been
allowed to borrow more money, it would have turned a big profit in 1998.

D
ay traders work fast, looking to make lots of little profits during a single
day. Arbitrage is a trading strategy that looks to make profits from small
discrepancies in securities prices. The word arbitrage itself comes from the
French word for judgment; a person who does arbitrage is an arbitrageur, or
arb for short. The idea is that the arbitrageur arbitrates among the prices in
the market to reach one final level.
In theory, arbitrage is riskless. It’s illogical for the same asset to trade at dif-
ferent prices, so eventually the two prices must converge. The person who
buys at the lower price and sells at the higher one will make money with no
risk. The challenge is that everyone is looking for these easy profits, so there
may not be many of them out there. Good arbitrageurs have a paradoxical
mix of patience, to wait for the right opportunity, and impatience, to place
the trade the instant the opportunity appears. If you have the fortitude to
watch the market, or if you are willing to have software do it for you (see
information on research services in Chapter 7), you’ll probably find enough
good arbitrage opportunities to keep you busy.
True arbitrage involves buying and selling the same security, and many day
traders use arbitrage as their primary investment strategy. They may use
high levels of leverage (borrowing — see Chapter 14) to boost returns. Other
traders follow trading strategies involving similar, but not identical, securi-
ties. These fall under the category of risk arbitrage. In this chapter, I cover the
terms and strategies used by day traders who engage in arbitrage. I discuss

the basics of arbitrage and how it can be put to good use by a patient trader. 
I outline the tools you can use to profit from price differences among similar
securities. Finally, I list the many types of arbitrage you might want to include
in your arsenal of trading strategies. 
Obeying the Law of One Price
The key to success in any investment is buying low and selling high. But
what’s low? And what’s high? Who knows?
In the financial markets, the general assumption is that, at least in the short
run, the market price is the right price. Only investors, those patient, long-
suffering accounting nerds willing to hold investments for years, will see 
deviations between the market price and the true worth of an investment. 
For everyone else, especially day traders, what you see is what you get.
Under the law of one price, the same asset has the same value everywhere. If
markets allow for easy trading — and the financial markets certainly do —
then any price discrepancies will be short-lived because traders will immedi-
ately step in to buy at the low price and sell at the high price. 
Punishing violators of the law
But what happens if what you see in New York is not what you see in London?
What happens if you notice that futures prices are not tracking movements in
the underlying asset? How about if you see that the stock of every company
in an industry has reacted to a news event except one? 
Well, then, you have an opportunity to make money, but you’d better act fast —
other people will probably see it, too. What you do is simple: You sell as much
of the high-priced asset in the high-priced market as you can, borrowing shares
if you need to, and then you immediately turn around and buy the low-priced
asset in the low-priced market.
Think of the markets as a scale, and you, the arbitrageur, must bring fairness
to them. When the markets are out of balance, you take from the high-priced
market (the heavier side of the scale) and return it to the low-priced market
(the lighter side) until both even out at a price in between.
If you start with a high price of $8 and a low price of $6, and then buy at $6
and sell at $8, your maximum profit is $2 — with no risk. Until the point
where the two assets balance at $7, you can make a profit on the difference
between them.
252
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

Of course, most price differences are on the order of pennies, not dollars, but
if you can find enough of these little pricing errors and trade them in size,
you can make good money.
Understanding arbitrage 
and market efficiency
The law of one price holds as long as markets are efficient. Market efficiency
is a controversial topic in finance. In academic theory, markets are perfectly
efficient, and arbitrage simply isn’t possible. That makes a lot of sense if you
are testing different assumptions about how the markets would work in a per-
fect world. A long-term investor would say that markets are inefficient in the
short run but perfectly efficient in the long run, so they believe that if they do
their research now, the rest of the world will eventually come around, allow-
ing them to make good money.
Traders are in between. The market price and volume are pretty much all the
information they have to go on. It may be irrational, but that doesn’t matter
today. The only thing a trader wants to know is if there is an opportunity to
make money given what’s going on right now. 
In the academic world, market efficiency comes in three flavors, with no form
allowing for arbitrage:
 Strong form: Everything, even inside information known only to com-
pany executives, is reflected in the security’s price.
 Semi-strong form: Prices include all public information, so it may be
possible to profit from insider trading.
 Weak-form: Prices reflect all historical information, so research that
uncovers new trends may be beneficial. 
Those efficient-market true believers are convinced that arbitrage is imagi-
nary because someone would’ve noticed a price difference between markets
already and immediately acted to close it off. But who are those mysterious
someones? They are day traders! Even the most devout efficient markets
adherent would, if pressed, admit that day traders perform a valuable service
in the name of market efficiency. 
Those with a less-rigid view of market activity admit that arbitrage opportuni-
ties exist, but that they are few and far between. A trader who expects to
make money from arbitrage had better pay close attention to the markets to
act quickly when a moment happens. And, I’d say this is the case for most
arbitrage strategies open to day traders.
253
Chapter 15: The World of Arbitrage

Finally, those who don’t believe in market efficiency believe that market
prices are usually out of sync with asset values. They do research in hopes of
learning things that other people don’t know. This mindset favors investors
more than traders, because it can take time for these price discrepancies to
work themselves out.
Because arbitrage requires traders to work fast, it tends to work best for
those traders who are willing and able to automate their trading. If you are
comfortable with programming and relying on software to do your work, 
arbitrage might be a great strategy for you.
Scalping for Profits
The law of one price is all well and good, but prices change constantly during
the day. They go up a little bit, they go down a little bit, they move every time
an order is placed. There’s a way that traders can profit from those move-
ments. It’s not exactly arbitrage, it’s scalping. Especially active in commodi-
ties markets, scalpers look to take advantage of changes in a security’s
bid-ask spread. That’s the difference between the price that a broker will buy
a security for from those who want to sell it (the bid) and the price that the
broker will charge those who want to buy it (the ask — also called the offer in
some markets). 
In normal trading, the bid-ask spread tends to be more or less steady over
time because the usual flow of supply and demand stays in balance. After all,
under market efficiency, everyone has the same information, so their trading
is consistent and allows the broker-dealers to generate a steady profit.
Sometimes, however, the spread is a little wider or narrower than normal, not
because of a change in the information in the market, but because of short-
term imbalances in supply and demand. 
A basic scalping strategy looks like this:
 If the spread between the bid and the ask is wider than usual, then the
ask is higher and the bid is lower than it should be. That’s because
slightly more people want to buy than sell, so the brokers charge the
buyers higher prices. The scalper uses this as a sign to sell.
 If the spread between the bid and the ask is narrower than usual, then
the ask is lower and the bid is higher than it would normally be. That
happens if there are slightly more sellers than buyers, and the broker
wants to find buyers to pick up the slack. The scalper would be in there
buying — and hoping that the selling pressure is short lived.
254
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

The scalper has to work quickly to make many small trades. He might buy at
$20.25, sell at $20.50, and buy again at $20.30. He has to have a low trade cost
structure in place (discussed later in this chapter) or else he’ll pay out all his
profits and more to the broker. He also has to be sure that the price changes
aren’t driven by real information, because that will make market prices too
volatile to make scalping profitable. Scalping is “picking up nickels in front of
a steamroller,” some traders say, because of the risk of focusing on small
price changes when bigger changes are underway.
Many day traders rely heavily on scalping, especially on slow market days.
Because each trade carries a transaction cost (discussed later in this chap-
ter), it can contribute to more costs than profits. Done right, though, it’s a
nice way to make some steady profits. 
Scalping, as defined here, is perfectly legal. However, the word is also used 
to describe some illegal activities, such as promoting a security in public 
and then selling it in private. If a big-name trader goes on his cable television
show and talks about how great a stock is so that the price goes up and then
sells it the next day when everyone else is buying, he has committed the
crime of scalping. 
Those Pesky Transaction Costs
Pure arbitrage works best in a world where trading is free. In reality, it costs
good money to trade. Sometimes you might notice a price discrepancy that
seems to last forever. You can’t work it because the profit wouldn’t cover your
costs. And you know what? That may be true for everyone else out there. 
In the real world, trading costs money. Consider all the costs of getting
started: buying equipment, paying for Internet access, learning how to trade.
Then there are the costs of doing business that vary with each transaction:
commissions, fees, interest, the bid-ask spread, and taxes. You don’t make a
profit on a trade unless it covers those costs. 
Even if you work with a broker that charges little or no commission, and even
if your broker charges no interest on day trading margin (loans against your
securities account), you can bet that your broker is making money off you.
That broker’s profit is showing up in the spread and the speed of execution,
so there is a still a cost to arbitrage that must be covered, even on a seem-
ingly free account. Trust me, brokerage firms are in business to make money,
whether or not their customers do. 
255
Chapter 15: The World of Arbitrage

Add up those trading costs, and you can find yourself in a frustrating situa-
tion: You can see the opportunity right there staring you in the face, but you
can’t take it. It either sits there, taunting you, or gets picked off by a trader
who has lower costs than you do. 
On the other hand, if you know what your costs are, you can avoid unprof-
itable opportunities. Don’t consider your fixed costs, like your office and
your equipment. Those expenses don’t change with any given trade. (Yes,
you have to cover them in the long run to stay in business, but you can
ignore them in the short run.) Instead, figure out how much money you give
to your broker on any given trade, on an order, per share, or per contract
basis. Write that number down on a sticky note, and put it on your monitor
so that you remember what you have to clear before you risk a trade. Just
don’t get so fixated on covering your costs that you avoid exiting trades at
the right time.
Risk Arbitrage and Its Tools
In its purest form, arbitrage is riskless because the purchase of an asset in
one market and the sale of the asset in another happen simultaneously —
you just let those profits flow right into your account. It is possible to do this,
but not often. No day trader who pursues only riskless arbitrage stays in
business long.
Return is a function of risk. The more risk you take, the greater the return you
expect to make. 
Because there are so few opportunities for true arbitrage, most day traders
looking at arbitrage strategies actually practice risk arbitrage. Like true arbi-
trage, risk arbitrage attempts to generate profits from price discrepancies;
but like the name says, risk arbitrage involves taking some risk. Yes, you buy
one security and sell another in risk arbitrage, but it’s not always the same
security and not always at the same time. For example, a day trader might
buy the stock of an acquisition target and sell the stock of an acquirer in the
hopes of making a profit as the deal nears the closing date. 
Risk arbitrage usually involves strategies that unfold over time — possibly
hours, but usually days or weeks. Pursuing these strategies puts you into the
world of swing trading (described in Chapter 2), which carries a little more
risk than day trading. 
256
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

In risk arbitrage, a trader is buying and selling similar securities. Much of 
the risk draws from the fact that the securities are not identical, so the law 
of one price isn’t absolute. Nevertheless, it forms the guiding principle, which
is this: If you have two different ways to buy the same thing, then the prices
of each purchase should be proportional. If they are not, then there’s an
opportunity to make money. And what day trader doesn’t want to make
money?
Arbitrageurs use a mix of different assets and techniques to create these dif-
ferent ways of buying the same thing. This section described some of their
favorites.
Derivatives
Derivatives are options, futures, and related financial contracts that draw or
derive their value from the value of something else, such as the price of a stock
index or the current cost of corn. They offer a lower-cost, lower-obligation
method of getting exposure to certain price changes. In the case of agricultural
and energy commodities, derivatives are the only practical way for a day trader
to own them. Because they are so closely tied to the value of the underlying
security, derivatives form a useful “almost, but not quite” asset for traders
looking for arbitrage situations. A trader may see a price discrepancy between
the derivative and the underlying asset, thus noticing a profitable trading
opportunity. 
Using a derivative in tandem with its underlying security, traders can con-
struct a range of risk arbitrage trades (and you can read more about them
later in this section). For example, a trader looking to set up arbitrage on a
merger could trade options on the stocks of the buying and selling compa-
nies rather than trading the stocks themselves. The more arbitrage opportu-
nities there are, the greater the likelihood of making a low-risk profit.
Levering with leverage
Chapter 14 covers leverage in detail, but I’m bringing it up again here. It’s the
process of borrowing money to trade in order to increase potential returns.
The more money the trader borrows, the greater the return on capital that
she can earn. Leverage is commonly used by day traders, because most
trades with a one-day time horizon carry low returns unless they are magni-
fied through borrowing. 
257
Chapter 15: The World of Arbitrage

That magic of magnification becomes especially important in arbitrage,
because the price discrepancies between securities tend to be really small.
The primary way to get a bigger return is to borrow money to do it. 
However, leverage has a downside: Along with improving returns, it increases
risk. Because even risk arbitrage strategies tend to have low risk, this may be
acceptable. Just remember that you have to repay all borrowed money, no
matter what happens to prices. Chapter 14 has more information on that. 
Short selling
Short selling is another topic from Chapter 14, and it creates another set of
alternatives for setting up an arbitrage trade. Short selling allows a day trader
to profit when a security’s price goes down. Instead of buying low and then
selling, high, the trader sells high first and then buys back low. The short
seller goes to her broker, borrows the security that she thinks will decline 
in price, sells it, and then buys it back in the market later so that she has 
the shares to repay the loan. (It all happens electronically, no office visits
required!) Assuming she’s right and the price does indeed fall, she pockets
the difference between the price where she sold the security and the price
where she bought it back. Of course, that difference is her loss if the price
goes up instead of down. 
By adding short selling to the bag of tricks, an arbitrageur can find a lot more
ways to profit from a price discrepancy in the market. New combinations of
cheap and expensive assets — and more ways to trade them — give a day
trader more opportunities to make trades during the day. 
The opposite of short is long. When a trader holds a security, he’s said to 
be long.
Synthetic securities
Feeling creative? Well, then, consider creating synthetic securities when looking
for arbitrage opportunities. A synthetic security is a combination of assets that
have the same profit-and loss-profile as another asset or group of assets. For
example, a stock is a combination of a put option, which has value if the stock
goes down in price, and a call option, which has value if the stock goes up in
price. By thinking up ways to mimic the behavior of an asset through a syn-
thetic security, a day trader can find more ways for an asset to be cheaper in
one market than in another, leading to more potential arbitrage opportunities.
258
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

A typical arbitrage transaction involving a synthetic security involves short-
ing the real security and then buying a package of derivatives that match its
risk and return.
Many of the risk arbitrage techniques covered later in this chapter involve
the creation of synthetic securities.
Complex arbitrage trading strategies require more testing and simulation
trading (covered in Chapter 11) and may possibly involve losses while you
fine-tune your methods. Be sure you feel comfortable with your trading
method before you commit big time and big dollars to it.
An Array of Arbitrages
The tools of arbitrage — derivatives, leverage, short selling, synthetic 
securities — can be used in all sorts of ways to generate potentially prof-
itable trades, and that’s what this section of the chapter covers. Most day
traders who decide to do arbitrage will pick a few strategies to follow. After
all, it’s hard enough to spot these opportunities; the trader who tries to do
too much is the trader who will soon be looking for a new job. Armed with
the information here, you can decide whether there’s an arbitrage strategy
that matches your approach to the market so that you can make it your own. 
The varieties of arbitrage transactions are listed here in alphabetical order.
It’s not exhaustive; there are plenty of other ways to exploit price differences
in the market, but some involve more time than a day trader is willing to
commit. I’ve put them in alphabetical order. Some are more complex than
others, some generate more opportunities than others, and some work best 
if you are willing to swing trade (hold for a few days) rather than day trade
(close out all positions at the end of the day). 
Many arbitrage strategies work best in combination with other strategies,
such as news-driven trading (discussed in Chapter 13). For example, it might
take a news announcement to cause people to pay attention to a company’s
stock so that there’s enough trading activity that day to close a price gap. If
you know about the pricing problem ahead of time, you can swoop in and
make the arbitrage that day.
There are certainly other types of arbitrage out there. Wherever people pay
close attention to the markets and price changes, they find small price differ-
ences to turn into large, low-risk profits. If you think you’ve found an arbi-
trage strategy not listed here, by all means, go and test it and see if it will
work for you.
259
Chapter 15: The World of Arbitrage

Capital structure arbitrage
Companies issue securities in order to finance their business, and investment
bankers are in the business of helping them do just that. Some companies are
nice and simple. Microsoft, for example, uses only stock for financing and has
only one class of stock. Others are far more complicated, using mixtures of
different classes of stock and different issues of debt to finance the growth.
General Electric, for example, has one class of common stock and seven dif-
ferent debt securities for its parent company and its finance subsidiary.
Think that’s a lot? General Motors has ten different securities. 
The way that a company is financed is its capital structure, and capital struc-
ture arbitrage looks for inappropriate price differences among all the differ-
ent classes of stock and debt outstanding. Although all securities tied to the
same business should trade in a similar fashion, they don’t always, and that
creates opportunities.
Say, for example, that SuperTech Company has two classes of stock, one on its
core business and one that tracks the performance of its nanotechnology sub-
sidiary. (A tracking stock is a corporate finance gimmick that goes in and out of
style; it’s stock on a subsidiary that is controlled by the parent company.) The
parent company still has exposure to the nanotechnology subsidiary, but that
is not reflected in its stock price. One day, the nanotechnology subsidiary
announces great earnings, and the stock goes way up, but SuperTech stock
doesn’t move even though it benefits. The capital structure arbitrageur imme-
diately shorts the nanotech subsidiary tracking stock and buys the parent
company stock (matching the size of the long and short positions so that they
move up and down in tandem), waiting for people to realize that the discrep-
ancy is there. 
Convertible arbitrage
As part of designing their capital structure, some companies issue convertible
bonds (sometimes called a convertible debenture) or convertible preferred
stock. These securities are a cross between stocks and bonds. Like an ordi-
nary bond, convertibles pay regular income to those who hold them (interest
for convertible bonds and dividends for convertible preferred stock), but
they also act a little like stock because the holders have the right to exchange
the convertible security for ordinary common stock.
Here’s an example: a $1,000 convertible bond pays 7.5 percent interest and is
convertible into 25 shares of stock. If the stock is less than $40 per share, the
convertible holder will prefer to cash the interest or dividend checks. If the
260
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

company’s stock trades above $40, the convertible holder would make more
money giving up the income in order to get the stock cheap. Because of the
benefit of conversion, the interest rate on a convertible security is usually
below that on a regular corporate bond.
Because a convertible security carries a built-in option to buy the underlying
stock, it generally trades in line with the stock. If the convertible’s price gets
too high or too low, then an arbitrage opportunity presents itself.
Consider this case: A day trader notices that a convertible bond is selling at 
a lower price than it should be, given the current level of interest rates and
the price of the company’s common stock. So, he buys the convertibles and
sells the common stock short (see Chapter 14 for more on short selling).
When the stock’s price moves back into line, he collects a profit from both
sides of the trade.
Fixed income and interest rate arbitrage
Fixed income securities are bonds, notes, and related securities that give 
their owners a regular interest payment. They are popular with conservative
investors, especially retirees, who want to generate a regular income from
the quarterly interest payments. They are considered to be safe, predictable,
long-run investments, but they can fluctuate wildly in the short term, which
makes them attractive to arbitrageurs. 
Interest rates are the price of money, and so they affect the value of many
kinds of securities. Fixed income securities have a great deal of interest-rate
exposure, because they pay out interest. Some stocks have interest-rate
exposure, too. Trading in foreign exchange is an attempt to profit from the
changing price of one currency relative to another, and that’s usually a func-
tion of the difference in interest rates between the two countries. Derivatives
have a regular expiration schedule, so they have some time value, and that’s
measured through interest rates. 
With so many different assets affected by changes in interest rates, arbi-
trageurs pay attention. With fixed-income arbitrage, the trader breaks out the
following:
 The time value of money
 The level of risk in the economy
 The likelihood of repayment
 The inflation-rate effects on different securities
261
Chapter 15: The World of Arbitrage

If one of the numbers is out of whack, the trader constructs and executes an
arbitrage trade to profit from it.
It’s rarely practical for a day trader to buy bonds outright. Instead, day
traders looking at fixed income arbitrage and other interest-rate sensitive
strategies usually rely on interest rate futures, offered by the Chicago Board
of Trade. You can read more about this in Chapter 3.
How would this work? Think of a day trader monitoring interest rates on U.S.
government securities. He notices that two-year treasury notes are trading at
a higher yield than expected — especially relative to five-year treasury notes.
He sells futures on the two-year treasury notes and then buys futures on the
five-year treasury notes. When the difference between the two rates falls
back where it should be, the futures trade will turn a profit. 
Index arbitrage
Market observers talk a lot about the performance of the S&P 500 Index and
the Dow Jones Industrial Average. These are market indexes, designed to 
represent the activity of the market, and are widely published for market
observers to follow. The performance of the index is based on the perfor-
mance of a group of securities, ranging from the 3,000 largest companies in
the market (the Russell 3,000) to a mere 30 large companies (the Dow Jones
Industrial Average).
Sure, an arbitrageur could buy all the stocks, and there are hedge funds that
do just that. But very few people can do that. Instead, they get exposure to
index performance through the many different securities based on the
indexes. Buy-and-hold mutual fund investors can buy funds that hold all the
same stocks in the same proportion as the index. Those with shorter-term
profits in mind can buy exchange-traded funds, which are baskets of stocks
listed on organized exchanges (see Chapter 3), or they can trade futures and
options on the indexes.
Arbitrageurs love the idea of an asset — like an index — that has lots of dif-
ferent securities based on its value. That creates lots of opportunities for mis-
pricing. Unless the index, the futures, the options, and the exchange-traded
funds are all in line, some canny day trader can step in and make some
money. 
For example, suppose the S&P 500 futures contract is looking mighty cheap
relative to the price of the S&P 500 Index. A trader can short an exchange-
traded fund on the index and then buy futures contracts to profit from the
difference.
262
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

Merger arbitrage
Every day, companies get bought and sold, and that creates arbitrage oppor-
tunities. In fact, one of the better-known arbitrage strategies out there is
merger arbitrage, in which traders try to profit from the change in stock
prices after a merger has been announced. It starts by looking at the follow-
ing details in the merger announcement:
 The name of the acquiring company
 The name of the company being taken over (and no matter what PR
people say, there are no mergers of equals)
 The price of the transaction
 The currency (cash, stock, debt)
 The date the merger is expected to close
Until the date that the merger actually closes, which may be different from
the date in the merger announcement, any and every one of the announced
details can change. The acquiring company may learn new information about
the target company and change its mind. A third company might jump in and
make an offer for more money. The shareholders may agree to support the
deal only if they get cash instead of stock. All that drama creates opportunity,
both for traders looking for one-day opportunities and for those willing to
hold a position until the merger closing date.
Here’s an example. Let’s say that Major Bancorp offers to buy Downtown
Bank for $50 per share in cash. Major Bancorp’s shares will probably fall in
price, because its shareholders will be concerned that the merger will be a
lot of trouble. Downtown Bank’s shares will go up in price, but not all the way
to $50, because its shareholders know that there is some risk that the deal
263
Chapter 15: The World of Arbitrage
Garbitrage
Traders get sloppy when an exciting merger is
announced. If one company in an industry gets
taken over, the stock in all the companies in the
industry will go up, often for no good reason.
Some get so carried away that they buy the
wrong stock entirely, usually because of confu-
sion over ticker symbols. If GAP Stores, ticker
symbol GPS, were to be taken over, chances are
good that the stock in Great Atlantic and Pacific
Tea Company — operator of the A&P grocery
stores, ticker symbol GAP — would also go up.
Such bad trading is known as garbitrage.

won’t go through. An arbitrageur would short Major Bancorp and buy
Downtown Bank to profit from the concerns. If Overseas Banque decides to
step in, then it might be a profitable idea to buy Major Bancorp and short
Overseas Banque. (If another bidder steps in and places a higher offer for
Downtown Bank, then the whole arbitrage unravels — hence, the risk.)
Option arbitrage
Options form the basis of many arbitrage strategies, especially for those day
traders who work the stock market. They are discussed on Chapter 3, but here’s
a little refresher. First, many different types of options are available, even on the
same security. The two main categories are puts, which bet on the underlying
security price falling, and calls, which bet on the underlying security price
rising. Puts and calls on the same security come in many different strike prices,
depending on where you want to bet the price goes. Some options, known as
American options, can be cashed in at any time between the date of issue and
the expiration date, and you can exercise others, known as European options,
only at the expiration date. (To complicate matters, American and European
options can be issued anywhere.) With all those choices, there are bound to be
a few price discrepancies for the alert arbitrageur. 
Maybe a day trader notices that on a day when a company has a big
announcement, the options exchanges seem to be assuming a slightly higher
price for the stock than where the stock is actually trading. He decides to buy
the underlying stock as well as a put; he also sells a call with the same strike
price and expiration date as the put. This creates a synthetic security that
has the same payoff as shorting the security, meaning that the trader has
pulled off a riskless arbitrage transaction. He effectively bought the security
cheap in the stock market and sold it at a higher price in the options market.
Pairs trading
Pairs trading, which involves buying a cheap stock and shorting an expensive
stock in the same industry group, is popular with many people who day trade
stocks. (It’s also the core of traditional hedge-fund investing, although there
are very few hedge funds that rely on it nowadays.)
A pairs trader watches an industry group and looks for situations where one
company seems to be doing especially well or one is doing especially poorly.
That would most likely indicate a problem in the way people are pricing the
industry, because in general, what’s good for one company is good for all of
them. A pairs trader would pay particular attention to news events that seem
264
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

to affect all but one or two companies in the same industry. If one of them
appears to be overvalued relative to the others, the pairs trader shorts the
pricey stock and buys the cheapest one. 
The pairs trader isn’t dealing with identical assets, of course, so the simulta-
neous purchase and sale is a lot riskier than it would be in true arbitrage.
Sometimes, there’s a very good reason why one stock is more expensive and
one is much cheaper than the rest of the industry. Good pairs traders are
willing to do a little fundamental research (see Chapter 12) so that they can
avoid being short the winner and being long the loser in an industry undergo-
ing big changes.
For Propeller-Heads Only: 
Statistical Arbitrage
Do you love crunching numbers? Are you comfortable with programming?
Are you an actuary looking for a career change? If the answers to these ques-
tions are yes, then statistical arbitrage might be right for you. It involves the
use of complex mathematical models to determine where a security should
be priced. It’s based on the notion that securities prices move randomly
along a normal curve. If all results are distributed normally, then reversion to
the mean holds. That means that a security’s price will equal the average —
the mean — price in the long run. If there are huge swings up, they have to be
matched by huge swings down eventually, so that the mean does not change. 
Here’s an example. A standard die has six sides. When you roll it, you are
equally likely to get any one of those six results. The mean of the six sides is
3.5, or (1 + 2 + 3+ 4 + 5 + 6) / 6. If you roll the die 100 times, the average of all
of those results should be close to the 3.5 mean. If your mean is actually 2.1,
then chances are good that your next several rolls will have an average
higher than 3.5 so that the total results will begin to close in on that 3.5 mean.
If not, you haven’t figured out a fabulous new secret to rolling a die; it’s more
likely that your die is loaded.
In statistical arbitrage, the trader works with huge databases of securities
prices to determine where the average should be, especially relative to
market conditions such as interest rate levels. If the current price is too 
high, it’s time to short it; if the price is too low, it’s time to buy. 
Here’s an example of how it works: A day trader has data showing that for the
past 20 years, food-processing companies have moved in a fixed percentage rel-
ative to unemployment rates. She notices that in the past month, the relation-
ship has diverged, with the stock prices having decreased more than expected
265
Chapter 15: The World of Arbitrage

relative to the current economy. So, she buys the stocks expecting them to go
up in price under the assumption that the normal relationship holds. 
You might be a great statistician, but chances are good that big hedge funds
and fancy brand-name brokerage firms have hired statisticians who are even
better than you. (And even then, there is no guarantee of success — hedge
fund Long-Term Capital Management failed in 1998 and nearly took the
world’s financial markets down with it despite having two Nobel Prize win-
ners on staff.) Just remember that statistical arbitrage brings you smack
against the biggest of the Big Kahunas on Wall Street.

I
t takes a special person to be a day trader — one who has quick reflexes, a
strong stomach, and a short-term perspective on the markets. Not every-
one’s meant to parcel out their workdays a minute at a time. Most people do
better with a long-term perspective on their finances, looking to match their
investments with their goals and thinking about their investment perfor-
mance over months or years rather than right now.
But those patient long-term investors can learn a thing or two from the fre-
netic day trader, and that’s what this chapter is all about. Many day-trading
techniques can help swing traders, position traders, and investors — people
who hold positions for days, months, or even decades — improve their
returns and make smarter decisions when it comes time to buy or sell.
Let’s face it: In theory, investors might be willing to wait forever to see great
stock picks play out, but in reality, they only have so much time and money.
A company’s stock may be ridiculously cheap, but the stock can languish 
a long time before everyone else catches on and bids the price up. The
investor who buys and sells well can add a few extra dollars to his invest-
ment return, and who doesn’t want that?
Not all day-traders close out every night, and some long-term investors 
will take a day-trading flyer on a hot idea. In this chapter, I cover some 
trading and analysis techniques used by day traders to help longer-term
investors improve their returns. Then I discuss some ways that long-term
investors might want to add day trading to their list of tricks to achieve
better total return. 

And heck, maybe a few investors want to give day trading a try, especially for
those securities that they have followed long enough to know how the market
reacts to news and whether those reactions are appropriate. For a long-term
investor, given the time to test strategies and set limits, day trading in known
markets might result in some nice incremental short-term returns.
The Trader’s Discipline
Successful day traders have an innate sense of discipline. They know when 
to commit more money to a trade and when to cut their losses and close up
shop for the day.
Unfortunately, a lot of long-term investors can get sloppy. They have done so
much research and committed so much time waiting for a position to work
out that they often forget the cardinal rule of the trader: The market doesn’t
know that you’re in it. The stock doesn’t know you own it, so it’s not going to
reward your loyalty. Securities go up and down every day for no good reason,
and sometimes you are going to make a mistake and you will have to cut your
losses. There’s no shame in that, as long as you learn from it. 
Now, how can you get that discipline? Start by developing an investment and
trading plan, covered in Chapter 2. Although investing is probably not your
primary occupation, you do want to have in writing what your objectives are
and how you plan to meet them given other constraints: time, tax considera-
tions, and risk tolerance. Then carefully evaluate your performance (covered
in Chapter 11) and keep a trade diary so that you know what you are trading
and why. Are there ways to improve? Are you making mistakes that could be
avoided?
Traders have to go through these exercises in order to survive. Investors
often skip these steps, but they shouldn’t.
A quick way for an investor to improve her trading discipline is to set up a
sell rule, a rule that tells her when to cut her losses and move on. For exam-
ple, if a stock is down 20 percent from where it was purchased or where it
traded at the beginning of the year, it might be time to sell, regardless of what
you hope it will do. 
Applying Momentum
Momentum investors look for securities that are going up in price, especially
if accompanied by acceleration in underlying growth. In a sense, they are
268
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

looking for the same thing day traders are — a security that is going to move
big — but they have the expectation of making money over a longer period of
time. The thought is that if a security is starting to go up in price, it will keep
going up unless something dramatic happens to change it. In the meantime,
there is plenty of money to be made.
The knock on momentum investing is that instead of buying low and selling
high, the goal is to buy high and sell even higher. 
Like most investors, a momentum investor starts with careful fundamental
analysis (described in Chapter 12), analyzing a security to determine what
will make it go up. Then the momentum investor looks for certain technical
and market indicators, similar to those described in Chapters 12 and 13 and
used by day traders. In addition, some momentum investors rely on chart
services, especially the Value Line and William O’Neil charts, to help them
identify securities that are likely to have momentum.
Earnings momentum
Earnings momentum is the province of the investor, not the trader. The
investor is looking at the earnings that a company reports every quarter to
see if they are going up at a faster rate, say from a steady rate of 10 percent a
year to 12, 13, or more. This often happens because of a new technology or
product that turns a decent company into a hot property in the stock and
options markets. If the earning growth rate is accelerating, then the underly-
ing price should go up at an accelerating rate, too.
Day traders don’t look for earnings momentum, but they do look for price
momentum. The two are usually related.
Price momentum
When a security goes up in price, especially at a fast clip with strong demand
underneath it, it is said to have price momentum. Most day traders are look-
ing for price momentum in order to make a swift profit. Many long-term
investors should look for momentum in order to avoid being stuck with a
position for months before it starts to move. 
It pays to be patient, but it pays even better if your money is working for you
while you wait. 
269
Chapter 16: Day Trading for Investors

Many momentum traders don’t care why something is going up in price; 
they only know that it is going up and that they can profit if they’re there 
for even part of the ride. Some of the different indicators that they look at 
are the following:
 Relative strength: There are different ways to calculate this, discussed
in Chapter 12, but the basic idea is that if the security is going up faster
than the market as a whole, it is showing momentum and might be a buy.
 Moving average convergence/divergence (MacD): This indicator looks
at how the average price of the security is changing over time. Is it stay-
ing relatively level, meaning that the price is moving slowly back and
forth, or is the indicator gradually going up, meaning that the price is
gradually going up, too? If you plot the moving average against the
actual price levels, a wide gap means that the security is moving up or
down faster than the average, and if it’s moving up, you’d probably want
to buy it. (Otherwise, consider shorting the security, and you can learn
about that in Chapter 14.)
 Stochastics index: This is the difference between the high and the low
price for a security over a given time period. Some analysts look at days,
some at weeks. The idea is that if the difference is getting bigger, that
may be because the security is moving up or down in price at a faster
than normal rate, creating an opportunity for a momentum buyer. 
At an extreme, momentum investing leads to bubbles, like the infamous dot
com bubble in the late 1990s. People were buying the stocks because they
were going up, not because they necessarily thought that the businesses
were worth much. It was fun while it lasted, but a lot of people lost a lot of
money when reality set in during March and April of 2000.
For investors only: momentum 
research systems
Many day traders rely on different research systems to help them identify
buy and sell opportunities in the course of a trading day. These systems usu-
ally don’t work for an investor, simply because investors are less concerned
about short-term movements. They wouldn’t see the value in systems that
scan the market and identify short-term price discrepancies, for example.
However, many investors use their own research services to help identify
good buy and sell opportunities. Two of the more popular ones are Value 
Line and the William O’Neil charts.
270
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

Value Line
www.valueline.com
Value Line is one of the oldest investment research services. The company’s
analysts combine price and trading volume information on stocks with finan-
cial data. The numbers are crunched through a proprietary model to gener-
ate two rankings: a stock’s timeliness and its safety. The higher the stock is
on the timeliness ranking, the better it is to buy or hold it now. Historically,
Value Line’s most timely stocks have outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial
Average and the S&P 500, so people are willing to pay for access to the com-
pany’s data. In addition, many libraries subscribe to Value Line’s print service
or online database, so you may be able to get access that way. (Hey, one of
the advantages of being an investor is that you have the time to go to the
library to look something up, a marvel to a day trader who’s afraid to go and
get a cup of coffee.)
William O’Neil
www.williamoneil.com
William O’Neil started a company to distribute his technical analysis system 
on stocks and the stock market, started a newspaper called Investor’s Business
Daily, and wrote a book called How to Make Money in Stocks (see the Appendix
for more information about it). The company’s data services are available only
to large institutional investors, such as mutual fund and insurance companies,
but between the book and the newspaper, individual investors can learn a lot
about identifying momentum in order to pick good times to buy or sell a stock.
Many traders — in all securities, not just stocks — find Investor’s Business
Daily to be at least as useful as The Wall Street Journal, because it looks at the
markets from a short-term trading perspective more than from a long-term,
business management angle.
The company’s ranking system is based on what it calls CAN SLIM, which is a
mnemonic for a list of criteria that a good stock should meet. Note that it
combines both fundamental and technical indicators:
 Current quarterly earnings should be up 25 percent from a year ago.
 Annual earnings should be up 25 percent from a year ago.
 New products or services should be driving earnings growth, not acqui-
sitions or changes in accounting.
 Supply and demand, meaning that the number of shares being pur-
chased each day, is going up.
271
Chapter 16: Day Trading for Investors

 Leading company in leading industry is the stock in the best position
to do well.
 Institutional sponsorship means that the stock is becoming more popu-
lar with mutual funds, pension funds, and other large shareowners.
 Market indexes, such as the Dow, the NASDAQ, and the S&P 500, should
all be up. 
Of course, there aren’t too many stocks out there that meet all the CAN SLIM
criteria, but the indicators can give an investor a way of thinking about better
times to buy (when more criteria are met) or sell (when fewer are being met).
The most serious momentum investors tend to be swing traders, who hold
positions for a few weeks or months. Longer-term investors often rely on
some momentum signals, though, to help them identify when it’s a good time
to buy a stock that has been languishing. 
Breaking News and Breaking Markets
One reason that the markets are so volatile is that they are responding to
news events. Prices reflect information. That’s why prices change when any
little bit of information comes into the market — even if it is just that some-
one wants to buy and someone wants to sell right now. The problem is that
sometimes the market participants don’t react in proportion to the news they
receive. Good traders have an almost innate ability to discern news that cre-
ates a buy from news that creates a sell. (You can learn more about that in
Chapter 13.) Sometimes traders want to go with the market and sometimes
they want to go against it.
When it’s your investment idea that’s been affected by a news announce-
ment, you need to consider how your position — and you — will react. After
all, no matter how long your time horizon and how careful your research,
things happen to companies: CEOs have heart attacks, major products are
found to be defective, financial statements turn out to be fraudulent. How 
are you going to respond?
The first point is that you have to respond. The market doesn’t know your
position, and the market doesn’t care. (Have I mentioned that already?) You
need to assess the situation and decide what to do. Given the information, is
it time to buy, sell, or stay put? It’s often okay to hold your long-term position
in the face of long-term news, but that should be an active decision, not a fall-
back. The trick is to be objective, and that’s not easy when real dollars are 
at stake.
272
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

Successful day traders are able to keep their emotions under control and
keep the market separate from the rest of their lives. Good investors should
be able to do the same. Chapter 8 has some ideas that might help.
When evaluating news, day traders look at how the news is different from
expectations. Investors can also consider how the news is different relative
to the known facts about the company to date. 
For example, let’s suppose that The Timely Timer Company is expected to
report earnings of $0.10 per share. Instead, the news hits the tape saying that
earnings will be only $0.05 because of accounting charges. The trader might
see that the earnings are below expectations news and sell all his shares to
minimize his losses for the day, moving on to another position. The investor
might know that the accounting charges were expected and go in and buy
more shares while the price is depressed.
The fact that there is a way for a buyer and a seller to match their differing
needs is the whole reason that the financial markets exist!
To a day trader, perception is reality. To a keen-eyed investor, the difference
between perception and reality might be an opportunity to make money.
Day traders have to think about the psychology of the market, because
everything moves so quickly. Investors sometimes forget about psychology
because they can wait for logic to prevail. When it comes time to place a buy
or sell order, however, understanding the psychological climate that day can
give the investor a price advantage, and every bit of profit improvement goes
straight to the bottom line.
Day traders keep their sanity by closing out positions at the end of the day,
so that they get on with their lives until the next market open. Investors, on
the other hand, might want to know what’s happening to their positions at
other times. Many brokerage firms offer mobile phone alert services, which I
think are a terrible idea for a day trader but might not be a bad idea for an
investor. 
Setting Targets and Limits
Good day traders set limits. They often place stop and limit orders to auto-
matically close out their positions when they reach a certain price level.
They have profit targets in mind and know how much they are willing to risk
in the pursuit of those gains.
273
Chapter 16: Day Trading for Investors

Good investors should set similar limits. It can be harder for them, because
they have often done so much research that they feel almost clairvoyant.
Why worry about the downside when the research shows that the stock has
to go up?
Well, the research might overlook certain realities. And even if the analysis
was thorough, things change. That’s why even the most ardent fundamental-
ist needs to have a downside risk limit. In most cases, stop and limit orders
are bad ideas for a long-term investor because they’ll force the sale of a secu-
rity during a short-term market fluctuation and they’ll force the sale when it’s
really a good time to buy more. Investors have a different risk profile than
day traders, so they need to manage risk differently. They still need to
manage risk, though.
With a stop order, the broker buys or sells the security as soon as a pre-
determined price is met, even if the price quickly moves back to where it 
was before the order took effect. A limit order is only executed if the security
hits the predetermined level, and it stays in effect only if the price is at that
level or lower (for a buy limit order) or at that level or higher (for a sell limit
order).
Martha Stewart’s defense in her insider trading case was that she sold her
ImClone stock because she had a pre-arranged sell order in place with her
broker, but it was not actually a stop order. The phone call with possible
inside information had nothing to do with it, she said, and in fact, the prose-
cutors could not disprove her. She was found guilty of obstruction of justice,
not insider trading.
Day traders close out their positions at the end of each day, so they rarely
review their limits. A swing trader or an investor, holding for a longer period
of time, needs to review those limits frequently. How much should a position
move each month, quarter, or year before it’s time to cover losses or cash
out with a profit? How has the security changed over time, and do the limits
need to change with it?
When the position is working out, an investor will think of letting it ride for-
ever. But, alas, few investments work that long into the future, so the investor
also needs to think in term of relative performance. Is it time to sell and put
the money into something else with greater potential? 
When managing money, day traders usually think about maximizing return
while minimizing the risk of ruin. For an investor, the goal is maximizing
return relative to a list of long-term objectives, including a target for risk. 
But because long-term objectives change, the portfolio will have to as well.
That means that a position that has been working out fine might have to be
changed in order to meet the new portfolio goals. The discussion is starting
to get beyond the scope of this book, but the point remains: Like successful
day traders, successful investors have a plan for how they will allocate their
money among different investments, and they adjust it as necessary.
274
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

Although investing is a long-term proposition and lacks the frenzy of trading,
it is still an active endeavor. Instead of putting energy into buying and selling,
the investor puts it into monitoring.
When an Investor Should Go Short Term
Many day traders are also long-term investors. Sure, they trade for the short
term, but they regularly take some of their profits and put them toward
investments that have a longer time frame. It’s smart risk management for a
business that has a high wash-out rate. After all, even a short-term trader has
long-term goals.
But does it ever make sense for a long-term investor to take up short-term
trading? It might. There are three reasons: the idea proves itself to be short-
term, the research shows short-term trading patterns that might be prof-
itable, and fundamental analysis supports short selling.
Don’t try riskier trading strategies unless your portfolio can handle the risk.
As with full-time day trading, part-time and occasional trading strategies
should only be done with risk capital, which is money that the trader can
afford to lose. Money needed to pay the mortgage this month or pay for
retirement in 30 years is not risk capital.
The idea proves to have a short shelf life
It happens to every long-term investor once or twice: He buys a security
intending to hold it forever, and within a few days or weeks, some really bad
news comes out. Or he buys only to see two days later that the company is
being sold. That great long-term buy-and-hold idea no long fits the original
parameters, so it’s time to sell. Despite the goal of holding forever, it’s time 
to get out and move on, even if it’s only a day later.
Your research shows you some 
trading opportunities
Good investors monitor their holdings, and some become intimate with the
nuances of a security’s short-term price movements even though the objec-
tive is to hold the position for the long term. An investor who gets a feel for
the trading patterns of a specific holding might want to turn that into swing
trading and day trading opportunities. Yes, it adds risk to the portfolio (and
the risks of day trading are covered extensively throughout this book), but it
can also increase return.

Chapter 16: Day Trading for Investors

For example, suppose that an investor who is fascinated with technology
stocks notices that the stocks always rise in price right before big industry
conferences and then fall when the conference is over. She might not want to
change any of her portfolio holdings based on this, but she might also want a
way to profit. So, she buys call options on big technology companies before
the conference and then sells them on the meeting’s first day. That short-
term trade allows her to capture benefits of the price run-up without affecting
her portfolio position. 
You see some great short opportunities
Short selling allows a trader to profit from a decline in the price of a security.
The trader borrows a security from the broker, sells it in the market, and then
waits in hopes that the price goes down. When it does, the trader buys the
security back at the lower price and repays the loan, keeping the difference
between the purchase price and the sale price.
Because the broker charges interest on the loaned securities, short selling
can get expensive. Traders who sell short are usually looking for a relatively
short-term profit, not necessarily over a single day, but over months rather
than years. 
In addition to the interest, short selling faces another risk, which is that the
security can go up in price while the trader is waiting for it to go down. In
order to reduce that risk, most short sellers do careful research to make sure
that they’re right about the security being all wrong. And who else does care-
ful research? Many long-term investors.
For the investor who loves to do research and who has some appetite for
risk, short selling is a way to make money from those securities that would
make terrible long-term holdings because it seems obvious that they aren’t
going to do well. When these investors come across securities that are
headed for trouble, they can short them in the hope of making a nice short-
term profit.
Judging Execution Quality
Day traders rely on outstanding trade execution from their brokers. They
need to keep costs as low as possible in order to clear a profit from their
trading, especially because their profits are relatively small. 
276
Part III: Day Trading Strategies 

Investors may have a greater likelihood of making a profit, given that they are
waiting for a position to work out rather than closing it out every night. Even
then, better execution will lead to better profits. The magnitude of the few
extra cents might be smaller relative to the entire profit, but it still counts.
Your broker makes money three ways. The first is on the commission charged
to make the trade. The second is on the bid-ask spread (also called the bid-offer),
which is the difference between the price that the broker buys the security from
customers and the price that the broker sells it to customers. The third is any
price appreciation on the security between when the broker acquired it and
when the firm sold it to the customer. Because three sources of profit are avail-
able, some brokers don’t even charge commission. But note that the broker can
still make money — lots of money — even without a commission.
When choosing a broker, consider total execution costs, not just commission.
Some brokers offering deep commission discounts make money from high
levels of trading volume, but others make their money from execution.
The broker has a few tricks for improving execution. The first trick is to
invest heavily in information systems that can route and match orders, as
even one second can make a difference if the markets are moving. The
second is to have a large enough customer base to be able to match cus-
tomer orders quickly. Finally, and most importantly, the firm has to decide
that execution is a strategic advantage it can use to keep customers happy.
Many brokerage firms would rather concentrate on research, financial plan-
ning, customer service, or other offerings to keep customers happy instead
of offering excellent execution.
In general, a firm that offers low commissions and emphasizes its services to
active traders will have better execution than a firm that emphasizes its full-
service research and advisory expertise. But there are exceptions, and in
some cases, the exceptions vary with account size.
Brokerage firms use several numbers to evaluate their execution, including
the following:
 Average execution speed: This is the amount of time it takes the firm 
to fill the first share of an order. Firms also track — and sometimes 
disclose — how long it takes to fill an entire order, on average.
 Price relative to National Best Bid or Offer: At any time, there is a list
of bid and ask prices in the market, and your broker might not have 
the best spread. The National Best Bid or Offer is the best price in the
market. You might not be able to get this price for all sorts of reasons,
usually because of the number of shares you want to buy or sell. For
example, if the best bid is for 100 shares, and you want to sell 500, you
won’t be able to get it. Brokerage firms track and report how close the
price you received was to the best bid or offer at the time.
277
Chapter 16: Day Trading for Investors

 Price improvement: Most brokerage firms buy and sell securities for
their own account. In fact, working as a trader at a brokerage firm might
be a great alternative to day trading (you can read about this and other
alternatives in Chapter 20). Because the firm might own the security or
want it for its own account, it might give you a slightly better price than
what is in the market.
 Average Effective Spread: This measures how much the spread
between the bid and the offer differed from the National Best Bid or
Offer, on average. The lower the Average Effective Spread, the better.
Certainly, your results will vary based on what types of securities you are
trading, what market conditions are like when you are trading, and how big 
of an account you have with the firm. But investigating the averages for a 
brokerage firm can help long-term investors decide whether it makes sense
to change firms in order to improve profits. 
So what can you do to improve your execution? Here are three suggestions:
 Ask the brokerage firm for its policies. The firm should be willing to 
provide this, as well as to give you some of its recent data, so that you
can decide whether the total value of the firm’s services matches the
total cost.
 Check the weekly “Electronic Trader” column in Barron’s as well as the
magazine’s annual review of online brokerage firms. Execution cost is a
key component of Barron’s evaluation. 
 Update your own hardware and Internet connection so that it’s as fast as
possible. If you are a day trader, it’s imperative to have good data (see
Chapter 6 for more information). If you are not a day trader but actively
manage your investment account, you might want to consider an
upgrade as well. A few seconds can make a difference.

Chapter 17
Ten Good Reasons to Day Trade
In This Chapter
 Getting ready to be your own boss
 Loving the investing business
 Figuring out what to expect from the markets
 Understanding the importance of financial and personal support systems
D
ay trading is a great career option for the right person in the right cir-
cumstances. It requires a strong, decisive personality who wants to be
running the show every step of the way, from backing up the PCs to collect-
ing all the profits. And good day traders have some financial cushion and
good personal support systems to get them through the tough times. 
In this chapter, I list ten really good reasons to take up day trading. (For bal-
ance, I cover ten bad reasons in Chapter 18.) Think you have what it takes?
Are you ready to go into business for yourself as a day trader? See how many
of these characteristics fit your life right now.
You Love Being Independent
Day trading is like owning any small business. You’re the boss and you call
the shots. Each day’s successes — and failures — are due to you and you
alone. Most likely, you’re working by yourself all day, so you’re responsible
for everything from the temperature in the office, to the functioning of the
computers, to the accounting for trades. 
Good day traders are independent. They don’t want someone to tell them
what to do; they want to figure it out for themselves. They love that chal-
lenge, whether it’s finding a good bargain on office supplies or developing a
profitable way to arbitrage currency prices.
If you would like to work for yourself and control your own destiny, keep
reading. Day trading might be for you. And if not, go to Chapter 20 to see
some alternative careers that involve the markets but do not put all of the
onus on you for success.

You Want to Work Anywhere You Like
All you need to day trade is a computer, an account with an online brokerage
firm, and high-speed Internet access. Nowadays you can find these tools
almost anywhere: at home, at the library, in a bar; in a big city, in a small
town, in the mountains, or in another country. Day trading offers a lot of geo-
graphic flexibility, which few other businesses do. You can trade while travel-
ing as easily as you would trade at home. You have the luxury of setting up
shop wherever you please, and if you decide to move, you can pack up your
laptop and move your trading activities to your new destination. 
You Are Comfortable with Technology
NASDAQ is the precursor to the Internet. Long before everyone and her
grandmother were online, securities traders were using complex electronic
communications networks to buy and sell securities. The financial services
industry was one of the first to embrace computer technology in a big way in
the 1960s, and it is still a technology-intensive industry. For all the images of
people in colored cotton jackets running around the exchange floor, waving
their hands and yelling at each other, most trading takes place over computer
networks via machines.
Day traders use software to develop and refine their trading strategies. They
trade online, using software to monitor and automate their trades. They track
their trades in spreadsheets and other software. They spend their days in
front of a screen, communicating online with other traders all over the world.
They don’t interact much with human beings during the trading day. It’s all
about the hardware boxes and the software interface between the trader and
the market data. 
Day traders are also self-employed, and many work from home. That means
that if their software crashes, they have to fix it. They have to handle the
upgrades, install the firewalls, back up the data. Sure, it may be possible to
pay someone to do it, but that cost is probably prohibitive — and the tech
consultant probably won’t be able to drop everything to get you up and trad-
ing again immediately. 
If you spill Diet Coke on your keyboard, don’t even bother trying to fix it. It’s
ruined. Get in the car and go to the office supply store and get a new one.
Better yet, keep a spare keyboard on hand. Don’t ask me how I know this.
Just trust me.
282
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Good day traders are comfortable with technology. If you like to mess around
with programs, don’t mind maintaining your computer, and understand how
to set up your hardware for maximum efficiency, you’re in good shape for day
trading. (Chapter 6 has some more on this, too.)
Day trading is like any other entrepreneurial business. You, the entrepreneur,
are responsible for everything! Some days, it’s wonderful, but some days, it’s
a real drag. 
You Want to Eat What You Kill
You don’t have to be a self-employed day trader to trade securities.
Brokerage firms, hedge funds, and exchange traders employ people to trade
for them, and in fact most securities trading takes place through such larger
organizations. But maybe you don’t want to share your profits with someone
else. Maybe you don’t want someone dictating your strategy, placing limits
on your trades, or determining your bonus based as much on factors such as
teamwork and firm profitability as on what you brought in. You want to eat
what you kill, as they say, and day trading is one way you can do that.
When you day trade, you’re responsible for your profits and your losses.
That means that you reap the rewards and you don’t have to share them 
with anyone else. That’s a powerful incentive for independent people.
You Love the Markets
Good day traders have always been fascinated with the markets and how
they move. If you watch CNBC for fun and have been following the securities
business for years, no matter what your day jobs have been, then you might
be a good candidate for day trading. Of course, I hope you’ve picked up more
than “some people make a lot of money doing this!” A lengthy immersion in
the cycles and systems that drive securities prices will give you a good foun-
dation for developing your own trading strategies and knowing what you are
up against.
And the markets are amazing, aren’t they? All these buyers and sellers, with
all their different needs, come together and find the price that gets the deal
done. The prices assimilate all kinds of information about the state of the
world, the desires of the people trading, and the future expectations for the
economy. It’s capitalism in its purest form, and it’s almost magical to watch
how it works. If you love how the markets work and want to learn first-hand
what they tell you about making money, then by all means keep reading.
283
Chapter 17: Ten Good Reasons to Day Trade

The market isn’t your opponent, because the market doesn’t know that you
are out there. The market is simply a playing field for your trading strategies
and execution style. 
You Have Investing Experience
If you have never opened an account with a brokerage firm, purchased a
stock, or invested in a mutual fund, you might not be suited for day trading.
It’s not that those activities are adequate preparation for day trading — they
aren’t — but they can help you understand what all can happen that can
cause you to make or lose money. If you’ve made some trades in the past,
you know some of the language and some of the limitations of the markets.
And that will give you a base to work from.
If you have not made any trades before, don’t quit your day job to day trade.
Instead, flip back to Chapter 16 for some ideas on how you can use short-
term trading in an investment portfolio. That way, you can learn more and
build up your savings before taking the plunge.
You Have Studied Trading Systems 
and Know What Works for You
Much of the work of day trading takes place long before entering the buy or
sell order. You have to define your trading system, see how it would have
worked in the past, and tested it to see how it works now. It’s not as exciting
as actually doing the day trading, because you won’t be making real money —
but you won’t be losing money, either.
Short-term trading has a huge potential for loss, and many traders are chas-
ing the exact same ideas. The more you know about how your strategy works
in different market conditions, the better prepared you will be to act appro-
priately and profitably.
Backtesting a strategy, which means checking it against historic securities
prices to see what would have happened if you had used the strategy in the
past, can give you a sense of how realistic and effective your strategy is.
Maybe you find that it’s profitable, but the conditions to make it work don’t
happen enough for you to make good money. Maybe you find that it’s too
complex to remember. Maybe you find that it worked when most of the secu-
rity’s trading took place in open-outcry pits on the exchange floor, but now
that more of the trading is electronic, it no longer works well. Such informa-
tion is power, because it can help you be a better trader.
284
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

It can take a long time to find a strategy that works enough of the time to
make it worth your while. Many day traders spend months developing, test-
ing, and refining their day trading strategy. You can read more about the
process of strategy testing in Chapter 11.
If you’ve taken the time to create and test a good strategy, then you’re ready
to go.
Because backtesting uses historic prices, you can do much of the work on
the side, at night and on weekends, before you start day trading full time. It’s
a good way to get prepared for your trading business while you save your
money and make other preparations for your new day trading venture.
You Are Decisive and Persistent
Can you make a decision and act on it? Can you assimilate information
quickly into a good strategy? If you screw up, do you figure out what you 
did wrong so that it doesn’t happen again and then move on? If so, you have
the basic personality of a good day trader. Traders see a lot of information
come at them quickly, and they have to be able to discern what the market is
saying so that they can find their entry points and then exit at a good time.
Short-term traders don’t have the luxury of thinking too much about what
they are doing. Trading has to become intuitive. They have to be able to act
on what they see when they see it. There’s no room for second guessing, for
hesitation, for choking or panic attacks. 
Good day traders are also persistent. Once they find a strategy that they
trust, they stick with it no matter how things are going. That’s how they’re
able to buy low and sell high.
Even great traders go through bad periods, but if they trust their system and
continue to stick with it, they usually pull out of it, often with money ahead. If
you’ve been able to stick things out other times in your life when things went
wrong, you know what to expect when day trading.
You Can Afford to Lose Money
Obviously, you want to be a day trader to make money. That’s the whole idea.
But day trading is difficult. Most traders quit in the first year. Some can’t take
the stress, some lose all their money, and some simply don’t make enough
money to make it worth their time.
285
Chapter 17: Ten Good Reasons to Day Trade

Like any small business, you’re taking a risk when you set up shop as a day
trader. That risk is easier if you can afford to lose money. I’m not saying you
need to have so much money that you won’t miss it when it’s gone, but you
shouldn’t be day trading with money you need to live on, any more than you
would open a store or start a law practice with money you need to buy gro-
ceries and pay the mortgage.
If your household does not have a second source of income, be sure to set
aside enough money to cover your living expenses while you get started. And
you should keep a second pot of money, your walk-away fund (see Chapter
8), so that you are free to quit day trading and move on to your next adven-
ture if you decide it’s not for you.
It’s especially important to have a financial cushion when you are day trading
so that you can ride your winners, stay in the market when things get bad,
and better handle the stress.
You can afford to commit to your trading
Having your living expenses covered, at least at first, isn’t just about dealing
with losses. It’s also about being able to stick with your trading. If you have a
constant need for cash to pay your bills, you may be tempted to take money
out of the market whenever you are doing well. This may keep you from re-
investing your profits. You won’t be sticking to your strategy, and your trading
capital will not grow as fast. Think of this as building a long-term asset, not as
generating a steady stream of current income.
You can stay in the market 
through the rough times
You know the old saw that the best way to make money is to buy low and sell
high, right? Well, this means that the best time to buy is usually when securi-
ties prices have been beaten up and you’ve lost a lot of money. If you can
afford to lose some money, it will be easier for you to stay in the game and
stick to your strategy so that you can profit big when the market finally turns. 
You can better handle the stress of losses
Not all your trades are going to work out. You are going to lose money. That’s
a given. If you have enough money that you do not fear loss, you’ll be able to
make better decisions. You’re less likely to panic if you know that you’ll still
286
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

be able to eat, that your lights are still going to turn on when you flip the
switch, and that you’ll have a roof to sleep under at night. You’ll be better
able to view the markets clearly and follow a winning strategy. Trading is
very much a game of psychology. Give yourself an edge by waiting until you
can afford to do it.
You Have a Support System
Trading is stressful. The markets gyrate with news events that no one can
foresee. Things just happen, and no one else who’s trading that day cares
how these events affect you. It’s enough to make you crazy some days — and
unfortunately, some traders do get crazy. Alcoholism, depression, divorce,
and suicide seem to be occupational hazards, often because day traders have
trouble separating what’s happening to them in the market with who they are
as people.
The securities markets are wonderful mechanisms for bringing together
diverse buyers and sellers. They are not wonderful for propping up your ego,
helping you through a rough time in your life, or slipping you a little extra
money when you most need it. The markets are not human. They are ruthless
machines designed to generate the best price for the aggregate of the buyers
and sellers participating that day, and some days, you’re going to suffer.
Good day traders are psychologically strong. They understand how their
weaknesses come out when they are stressed. They have people and activi-
ties in their lives who help give their brains a break from trading, ranging
from regular exercise routines to good friends to hobbies. 
If you are going to be a day trader, you need to have some support in your life
for when things go wrong. Because some days, they will go wrong, and real
money will be lost, and it will feel terrible.
Chapter 8 talks about managing the stress of day trading, and in many ways, I
think it’s the most important chapter in this book.

Ten Good Reasons to 
Avoid Day Trading
In This Chapter
 Considering other ways to invest that suit you better
 Finding out day trading is your own small business 
 Deciding whether your personality is right for day trading 
 Putting a damper on unrealistic expectations
D
ay trading isn’t right for everyone. In fact, it’s a bad idea for most
people. It requires a strong personality, someone who can face the gyra-
tions of the markets day in and day out. And it also requires someone with
enough attention to detail to run a business. It’s a great career option for the
right person in the right circumstances. But for people who have trouble
keeping cool, who don’t have the patience to learn how to trade, and for
anyone who has a gambling problem, day trading can be a quick road to ruin. 
In this chapter, I list ten signs that maybe day trading isn’t right for you right
now. Take them seriously. Most day traders lose money, in part because a 
lot of people who aren’t cut out for day trading try it anyway. Don’t fret if it
turns out that you aren’t day trader material. Most people aren’t. That’s why
Chapter 16 and Chapter 20 offer alternatives that might be better for your
money and your career.
You Want to Learn Investing 
by Day Trading
Many people want to manage their own investments, and it’s certainly possi-
ble. It requires taking the time to learn about the basics of finance, such as
the relationship between risk and return, proper diversification, and figuring
out your time horizon. In fact, there’s a great book called Investing For
Dummies, 4th Edition, by Eric Tyson (Wiley) that can help.

Some people confuse investing with day trading, though, and they are not the
same. I list tons of information on the differences in Chapter 4, but here’s the
condensed version: Day trading involves rapid buying and selling of securi-
ties to take advantage of small movements in prices. This can be a successful
strategy for part of your investment account, but it is not a good idea to day
trade with all your money. 
It is entirely possible to buy and sell securities on your own without being a
day trader. And if you don’t know another good term for “self-employed
person managing her own money,” just tell people you run your own hedge
fund. You’ll get better tables at restaurants that way.
In modern usage, a hedge fund is a private investment partnership that does not
have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You wouldn’t be
stretching the truth much to say that you’re running a hedge fund!
You Love Fundamental Research
Fundamental research, discussed in Chapter 12, is the process of analyzing a
company to see how good its business is and what the company’s securities
are worth. Fundamental analysts crunch numbers, build forecasts, check out
products, and look for stocks that are going to do well over the long term.
They dream of uncovering the next Microsoft or the next Wal-Mart and hold-
ing the stock all the way up.
Fundamental research is antithetical to day trading. Day traders look for
profit opportunities in short-term price movements. They often do not know
what industry a company is in, nor do they care. If you love the fundamen-
tals, you’re probably too analytical to be a good day trader.
You’re Short on Time and Capital
Getting started in day trading is a lot like buying a small business. It takes
commitment of both time and of money. If you don’t have enough time, it is
difficult to learn technical patterns. If you don’t have the money, you won’t be
able to work through rough cycles.
And there will be rough cycles. That’s day trading’s only sure thing.
Some day traders are able to trade part time. If you are disciplined, you can
be successful at it. The key is to close out your positions at the end of your
designated trading period as though the market day were ending. If your plan
is to trade for two hours a day, then trade for two hours a day and no more.
Use an alarm clock as your personal trading bell.
290
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

You Like Working as Part of a Group
A decade ago, most large cities had day trading offices, called trading arcades,
where traders could go each day to buy and sell securities. The big advan-
tage these firms offered was high-speed Internet access. Now almost every-
one can get high-speed Internet access at home, so there’s little need for day
traders to go elsewhere, and most of these offices are closed.
Working at home is great for some people. If you prefer camaraderie during
the day, like the support of a team, and want friendly faces around you,
you’re likely to be miserable day trading. It’s just you and the market, and 
the market doesn’t have a great sense of humor.
You Can’t Be Bothered with the 
Details of Running a Business
Day traders are small-businesspeople, and their entrepreneurial flair goes
beyond making their own buy and sell decisions. They also buy equipment,
shop for supplies, and maintain careful income tax records. To some, this is
exhilarating: no more mean office manager who decides how many and what
kind of pens must be used. No more going through hoops and bringing in let-
ters from a doctor to get a fancy ergonomic chair. You’re the boss, and if you
want it, you can have it.
But to others, all this responsibility is overwhelming. Picking out pens?
Creating backup procedures? Worrying about accounting software? It’s too
much. If the mere thought of standing at the office supply store gives you the
heebie-jeebies, you might want to consider trading as an employee rather
than trading for your own account.
You Crave Excitement
Trading seems so exciting. You’ve seen the stereotypical picture of the people
on the floor at the Chicago Board of Trade, wearing bright-colored jackets
and loud ties, screaming and waving their arms. It gets my blood running to
just think about it. Of course, they may be shouting out coffee orders and
waving their arms in a debate over the Cubs versus the Sox. With so many
people together, they can make their own excitement on days when the
market isn’t doing anything interesting.
291
Chapter 18: Ten Good Reasons to Avoid Day Trading

For that matter, the number of people trading on exchange floors is small and
getting smaller. The Chicago Board of Trade is merging with the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, partly because of changes in how people trade.
Nowadays, most traders sit in offices in front of computer screens. They have
to stay focused on the little blips in front of them, and it can be deathly dull.
Some days few, if any, opportunities come up to trade using your system. 
If you crave excitement and have trouble staying focused, you might find that
day trading is too boring for you. It can involve intense stress with few oppor-
tunities to work it off during the day.
You’re Impulsive
With the frenzy of trades and the rapid-fire decisions involved, day trading
might seem like a perfect career for an impulsive person. It’s all about
instinct, about acting on your hunches, about pulling the trigger and seeing
what happens. Right? Uh, no. To be a good day trader, you have to trust your
trading system more than your hunches. Sometimes you’ll make trades when
it doesn’t seem right and you’ll sit out periods even though you are itching to
get in. Good day traders are quick thinkers, but they do think. If you like to
act now and deal with the consequences later, day trading isn’t a good idea
for you.
You Love Going to the Casino
Do get a big rush out of gambling? Do you love trying to beat the odds? Does
day trading seem like it would like a visit to Vegas without the airfare? Then
you know what? You shouldn’t be day trading. Unlike at a casino, no one is
even going to give you free drinks in exchange for your massive losses.
A lot of traders like to gamble. Every trader has some crazy story about play-
ing Liar’s Poker, played with the serial numbers on dollar bills instead of with
cards, or about a friend of a friend who bet on whether the person walking in
front of him would turn right or left. And that’s fine if they keep their gam-
bling in perspective and bet no more than they can afford to lose.
Trading isn’t necessarily gambling, but it can be, especially if you get carried
away with the market and don’t stick to your trading and money management
systems. But remember this: in gambling, the odds always favor the house.
When you cross the line, you hand your profit potential over to someone else.
292
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

The line between day trading and gambling is thin. Check the questions at
www.gamblersanonymous.org/20questions.html to see whether you
might have a gambling problem. Substitute day trading for gambling and see
what you come up with. And by all means, get help if you have a problem.
Don’t take up day trading.
You Have Trouble Setting Boundaries 
Successful day traders are disciplined. They have set trading hours, which
they stick to, and set systems for planning trades and managing their money.
They took the time to carefully test their trading strategy (see Chapter 11 for
more on how you can do that). They understand that if they don’t have a
system and manage their risk, they are more likely to become one of those
numerous day traders who lose everything early on.
The whole idea behind day trading is that you limit risk by closing out your
positions at the end of the day. The financial markets are global, though, so 
in theory, the trading day never ends. If you have a hard time turning off the
lights at the end of the day, you might not be the best day trader. If you
resent rules, you might rebel against the rules that you’ve set for yourself. 
Good day traders know that they are cut out for day trading before they even
begin. They’ve taken the time to assess how their personality and psychologi-
cal makeup mix with the demands of the job. And one key trait is discipline.
You Want to Get Rich Quick
Day traders look for short-term profit opportunities, so it follows that day
trading leads to big, fast profits, right? Wrong. Day traders make money by
collecting a large number of small profits. Those who make money usually do
it through patience and persistence. Yeah, there may be one or two out there
who managed to make a killing in a week, but they are the exception.
Research shows that 80 percent of day traders lose their capital and are gone
from the business within one year. Instead of getting rich, you are more likely
to go broke quick from day trading. If you don’t like those odds, try some-
thing else with your money.

Chapter 18: Ten Good Reasons to Avoid Day Trading

The Guy on the Infomercial 
Said It Would Work
A lot of money can be made in day trading, but sometimes it seems like more
money is made selling day trading training systems. Some of these are heav-
ily marketed, even through television infomercials. The sales pitch makes 
day trading seem like an easy, safe, fun way to make money using your own
smarts. It leaves out pesky details about researching and testing systems,
high levels of risk, and the pressure trading can place on a person. And the
wash-sale rule is never mentioned.
Day trading is great for some people. But like anything, if it sounds too good
to be true, it probably is. Don’t let a strong-arm sales pitch cost you your
hard-earned money.

Ten Common Day Trading
Mistakes
In This Chapter
 Planning your business and your strategy
 Evaluating and controlling risks
 Trading not too much, not too little, but just right
 Developing confidence in your trading system
 Keeping emotions in check
D
ay trading is tough. Many popular markets are zero-sum games, meaning
that for every winner, there’s a loser. Other markets, such as the stock
market, have a positive bias, meaning they have a tendency to increase in
value over time, but you may rarely see big moves in any one day. And the
whole point of day trading is to close your positions each night. Most day
traders lose money, in part because they make obvious, avoidable mistakes.
This list of ten mistakes will help you avoid the most serious ones so that you
can be more successful from the get-go. Following them is no guarantee that
you will make money trading, but it will certainly reduce your risk and
improve your odds. And that’s half the battle.
Starting with Unrealistic Expectations
Most day traders lose money. Some research shows that 80 percent of day
traders wash out in the first year. Brokerage firms that deal with day traders
are constantly figuring out ways to attract new customers, because it is so
hard to retain the ones they have for the long term.

Yes, some traders make money. A few make a lot of money. But they are the
exception. It is tough to make money day trading, and even tougher to make
enough money to cover the value of your time. If you go into trading knowing
that it’s hard, that you should only risk money that you can afford to lose, and
that you need to think about it as a business, you’ll have a leg up on those
who think that they’ve found an easy way to make millions from the comfort
of their own home — and who are then stunned to discover they are broke.
Starting Without a Business Plan
Trading is a business. When you decide to day trade, you are committing 
capital to an entrepreneurial business with a high risk of failure. You are no
different from your brother-in-law, who decides to open a sandwich shop
franchise; your neighbor, who joined a startup company for little salary and
lots of equity; or your college buddy, who has been trying to make a go of it
as a full-commission life insurance salesman. You are all out on your own,
risking your capital in the hope of great success but knowing that many
others doing the same thing fail.
Successful businesses have business plans, and your trading business is no
different. You need to specify what you are going to trade, and when, and
how, and with how much money, before you get started. You need to deter-
mine what equipment you need, what services and training you want, and
how you will measure your success. Chapter 2 can help you with a business
plan, and the rest of the book can help you fill in the appropriate sections of
it. Having the plan will keep your expectations in line and create a profes-
sional starting point for your new trading venture.
Failing to plan is planning to fail, as the cliché goes. You are risking too much
of your hard-earned money to skip careful upfront planning. Take responsibil-
ity for your trading.
Starting Without a Trading Plan
A business plan sets the framework for your trading business, but you need
to fill in the details. How are you going to trade? What signals will you watch
for? Why will you enter a position, and why will you close it? That’s your trad-
ing plan. Good traders have trading plans, so that they know exactly what
they will do as they see opportunities in the market. This reduces the fear
and doubt that can unsettle most traders and it heads off the panic that
destroys more than a few. Read Part III for ideas on how to trade.
296
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Good trading plans have to be tested and evaluated. Chapter 11 has good
information on testing and evaluation so that you have enough confidence in
your system to follow it, even when the market gets squirrelly on you.
Failing to Manage Risk
Day trading is risky business, and most day traders quit because of losses.
(Have I told you that already?) Even traders who stick with it have many losing
trades. That’s why they have risk management systems in place. Their trading
plans include stops, which automatically execute buy or sell orders when secu-
rities reach predetermined levels. (Stops are discussed in Chapter 2.) They also
have a money management system (discussed in Chapter 9) so that they risk
their capital appropriately.
The day trader looking for trouble places orders without thinking about how
much of a security to buy or sell at any one time, and she thinks that she’ll
just know when to sell. And then she second-guesses herself and finds herself
with bigger losses than she intended.
If you’re going to day trade, be safe. You know what the risks are (that’s why
you picked up this book), so use the protection offered by stops and sound
money management.
Most day traders lose money. Don’t risk money you can’t afford to lose, and
plan for the risks that you take.
Not Committing the Time and 
Money to Do It Right
Day trading is a job. It’s a small business endeavor that requires research 
and training well in advance of the first trade. It’s not something you can
squeeze into an hour a day as a hobby. To do well, you need to set regular
hours and have enough money to generate reasonable returns without 
unreasonable risks.
Many people think day trading is something that’s easy to enter, and that
they can generate profits while their kids are napping. That’s a mistake. If 
you can’t dedicate the time to studying the markets and understanding how
you react to them, you will have trouble staying in the trading business.
297
Chapter 19: Ten Common Day Trading Mistakes

Successful traders start out with enough money to last through periods of
drawdown and are still able to generate meaningful dollar returns. Day trad-
ing is a business of frequent trades with small percentage gains and a high
potential for loss. If you have days of losses, a small account will quickly 
end up with too little money to meet minimum order sizes. On the upside, a 
1 percent return on $1,000 is equal to $10, and a 1 percent return on $100,000
is $1,000. If you have more money to begin with, the dollars you make from
day trading will seem more real to you. The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers define day
traders in part as customers with $25,000 in their accounts. If you have
$25,000 you can afford to lose, you are more likely to be a successful day
trader than if you have only $2,500.
You are going to lose money. All day traders have bad days, and they are
more likely to lose money early in their trading career before they get a feel
for the markets and their own reactions to it. If you have enough money when
you begin, you can consider these losses to be part of your apprenticeship. 
Chasing the Herd
Everyone in the market is looking at the same data and the same technical
indicators (like those discussed in Chapter 12). Good day traders follow
market trends, but with the goal of being early or on time. Those who get in
late get crushed — they buy too high, they sell too low. It’s an easy tempta-
tion, because it’s so hard to watch the market moving away from you.
Day trading requires quick reactions. It’s video games and psychology, some
people joke, because the trader who can figure out what others in the market
are doing and then click on the mouse button fastest has a huge advantage.
The trader who hesitates or goes along for the ride is likely to be ruined.
There’s no easy solution for this. It helps if you know that you are psychologi-
cally cut out for day trading (covered in Chapter 8) and have confidence in
the long-term performance of your trading system (covered in Chapter 11).
But to a big extent, you just have to have some experience in the markets to
know how your trading system matches what’s in your head.
Switching Between Research Systems
Day traders lose money, at least part of the time. That can cause a day trader
to lose trust in his trading system. And many day traders do what seems logi-
cal, which is move to a trading system that seems to be working. The prob-
lem is that no system works all the time — if one did, everyone would use it.
298
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

And sometimes things look worst before they turn. By switching systems
whenever things look bad, the trader never learns the nuances of how a given
system works for him. And he’s likely to get stuck on another down trend,
picking up the new system right when the old one starts to work again.
Markets go in cycles. No system will work for you all the time, but if you
panic and start trying new things without doing a lot of upfront work, you’re
likely to make things worse. Chapter 11 covers performance evaluation and
system testing in great detail. The more you understand your system and
how it works, the less likely you are to be brought down by floundering
around for new systems all the time.
Anyone who has a magic trading system that works in all markets is retired
and living on a beach in Maui. Everyone else has to live through a few rough
stretches.
Overtrading
Because day traders don’t hold positions for long periods of time, they rarely
enjoy big and profitable price moves. Instead, they make money from lots of
transactions with small profits. They are crazy people, moving in and out for
short periods. But believe it or not, the day trader who trades too much will
lose out. She won’t be in the market for large intra-day moves, and she’ll get
killed on commissions and other transactions costs.
As paradoxical as it seems, many day traders do better by making fewer
trades each day. That way, commissions and fees take a smaller bite of the
profit. One way to profit from fewer trades is with better money management,
discussed in Chapter 9. A trader who puts money to work appropriately can
often make more money than one who trades frenetically.
Sticking Too Long with Losing Trades
This a corollary to the overtrading mistake. Day traders are often overcome
with fear, doubt, greed, and hope. They are afraid to recognize a loss. They
wonder if they are good traders. They don’t want to pay the commission to
get out of the loser. And if the security was a good buy at the higher price, it’s
surely a better buy now that it’s gone down in price. These traders think that
if they just keep a positive mental attitude, everything will work out all right
in the end.
299
Chapter 19: Ten Common Day Trading Mistakes

Good traders have systems in place to limit their losses. They use stop
orders (Chapter 2) to force themselves out of bad trades. They would rather
put the money to work on a good trade than stick out a bad one.
The market doesn’t know your position. Therefore, no amount of wishing and
hoping will cause it to reward you for your patience. If a trade isn’t working,
get out. Tomorrow is another day.
Getting Too Emotionally Involved
Trading is a stressful business. You’re up against an impersonal market that
moves seemingly at random (and many academics would say that it moves
truly at random.) It involves money, which to some people is a way to keep
score in life and to others is their primary source of security. Losing trades
mean a loss of status and a loss of safety. It’s easy to think that the entire
market is conspiring against you — you specifically — and it’s no wonder so
many traders are head cases.
The best traders are almost Zen-like in their lack of attachment to the market.
They are able to remove themselves from the frenzy of the trading day so
that they are not susceptible to fear, doubt, greed, and hope. Chapter 8 has
some advice that can help you approach the trading day in a calmer manner.
Only you know whether you are capable of that.

Ten Alternatives to Day Trading
In This Chapter
 Considering careers options for traders
 Finding other ways to manage your money 
 Getting the excitement without the risk of ruin
M
aybe you like the idea of trading, but after reading this book, you’ve
decided that working for yourself making large numbers of short-term
trades isn’t exactly what you want to do. But then what options are there? In
this chapter, I put forward several ideas for alternative activities that might
better match your interests than day trading. These include other career
options, different ways to invest your money, and entertainment that gives
you the excitement of trading without the same amount of risk.
Proprietary Trading for an Investment
Company or Hedge Fund
Day trading is a solitary pursuit, and not everyone who wants to trade also
wants to run his own business and work by himself all day. Good thing many
companies need people to trade for them. Investment companies, brokerage
firms, and hedge funds hire traders. These people are often known as prop
traders, short for proprietary, and their job is to trade money for the firm’s
account. These traders may have to follow a set style, or they may be free to
trade as they see fit. Prop traders don’t keep all their profits, but they get a
small salary, benefits, and a bonus that represents a generous cut of the
money they make.
Proprietary trading lets you combine the safety net and camaraderie of a job
with the excitement and potential huge returns of trading. It’s a good option
for those who want to spend their days with other people. 

Many firms have training programs that pay entry-level employees low
salaries, no matter how much money they may have made at other jobs.
These junior staffers often do a lot of clerical work and run errands for the
senior traders. If they show an aptitude for the business, they’ll be promoted
quickly. The market is a meritocracy.
Trading for an Agricultural, Energy, 
or Commodities Company
The options and futures markets (discussed in Chapter 3) were developed to
help commodity companies manage their income and expenses better. That’s
why the traditional products on those exchanges almost seem funny in the
era of modern finance: pork bellies, soybeans, and orange juice. 
But you know what? Those traditional customers for those traditional prod-
ucts are still active, and they need people to help them. Energy companies,
growers, food processors, and metals companies need someone to trade 
barrels of oil, bushels of corn, live cattle, and silver futures. They are often
more interested in hedging — using trading to reduce risk rather than
increase return — than in trading to maximize return, but depending on
market conditions and firm philosophies, they may be open to traders who
want to take on risk. 
Joining an Exchange
In the olden days, day trading was impossible because individuals could not
afford to get a data feed, let alone execute orders. People who wanted to
trade for themselves had to move to a city with an exchange, submit their
membership application, pay their fees, and go to work on the floor.
Although floor trading is going away, the exchanges are not. They still have
members — who can trade on the floor or electronically — and they have a
lot of services for their members. If you really want to be close to the action,
you can join. It’s not cheap; for example, membership (also known as a seat)
at the Chicago Board of Trade is running around $700,000 and requires back-
ground checks, financial statements, and licensing. (The membership itself
has value, and people have been known to buy it as an investment.) Many
exchanges will allow you to lease membership in order to have access to the
floor and the electronic exchange at a lower cost, and that runs $3,000 to
$4,000 a month at the Chicago Board of Trade.
302
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Many of the exchanges are now public companies. Instead of buying a 
membership or a seat, those who want trading privileges buy a special class
of stock that can only be sold to someone who is qualified to trade on the
exchange. You can buy regular shares of the exchanges through your broker-
age firm — you can even day trade those exchange shares, if you like, but
owning them won’t give you membership privileges.
In Chapter 3, you can find out more about the different exchanges. If you are
interested in membership, go to each exchange’s Web site, as the policies and
prices vary greatly.
Traditional Investing for 
Your Own Account
I’m thinking that some people who buy this book don’t really want to day
trade. Instead, they want to manage their own investment accounts during
the day instead of having a regular job. You can manage your money yourself
without making a high volume of short-term trades, and given the huge num-
bers of day traders who wash out (80 percent, according to some studies),
you might be better off. True, you won’t have the drama of day trading, and
you won’t need to focus your attention for hours on end. Instead, you’ll be
researching stocks and mutual funds, allocating your portfolio among several
different assets, and tracking your tax liabilities. If you aren’t sure where to
start, consider picking up a copy of Investing For Dummies, 4th Edition, by
Eric Tyson (Wiley).
In addition, Chapter 16 has some ideas for ways that you can use day trading
techniques for long-term accounts.
Joining an Investment Club
One reason why day trading is so risky is that traders are by themselves,
learning as they go along. Unlike working for a company that might have paid
apprentices or junior employees who get paid to stay up to speed, a day
trader often pays others for training, coaching, and research (discussed in
Chapter 7) that are of varying degrees of helpfulness. It can be scary, and
expensive, and disheartening.
303
Chapter 20: Ten Alternatives to Day Trading

There is a good option, though. Before you take up day trading, consider
forming or joining an investment club. These are groups of people who want
to learn more about investing. They may be neighbors, members of the same
church, or participants in the same community organization. Club members
pool small amounts of money, such as $50 a month, meet regularly, and learn
about different types of securities, methods of research, and styles of trading.
One place to get more information on how to join, start, and operate an invest-
ment club is that National Association of Investors Corporation (www.better-
investing.org), a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting investment
clubs and individual investing. If you are relatively new to investing, you may
want to check out an investment club before taking up day trading.
Taking a Swing at Swing Trading
Swing trading is a cross between day trading and longer-term investing.
Instead of closing out their positions at the end of each day, swing traders
may hold their positions for a few days or even weeks. It’s a way to change
the risk and return profile. Price changes can happen overnight when you are
away from your computer monitors, but the luxury of time means that there
are more opportunities for your position to work out.
Swing trading favors traders with a little bit of patience, who can handle 
the risk of holding open positions overnight, and who have some interest 
in industry news and fundamental information. It’s discussed a little bit in
Chapter 2.
Gambling for the Fun of It
Sloppy day traders are often gamblers: they aren’t following a strategy; they
just like the rush and the expectation of the positive return. This means that
they aren’t always paying attention to the market, nor are they ready to
commit to the discipline of spending days in front of a screen and evenings
reviewing market activities. If you are more of a gambler than a trader, why
not just admit it?
Assuming that you are not a problem gambler (see www.gamblersanonymous.
org/20questions.html), keep your day job, contribute to your retirement
plan, and set aside a portion of your spending money to take to the casino. And
don’t gamble more money than you bring.
304
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

When you gamble, the odds always favor the house, so you’ll probably lose
money. When you day trade, the odds on each particular trade are even or
slightly in your favor, at least before considering commissions, but not so
much that you are guaranteed an easy return. So if it’s the rush and not the
return you want, admit it and book a flight to Las Vegas.
In a casino, you get some of your losses returned to you in the form of drinks,
show tickets, and other comps. Of course, it’s cheaper to hold on to your
money and pay cash for your drinks. That’s my strategy. I hate to lose, so I
don’t gamble in the first place.
Play Day Trading Video Games
Want the excitement of day trading without the risk of losing your money,
either to the markets or to the casino owner? Think you can figure out the
markets, but don’t want to put real money or your job on the line to find out?
Then why not play a day trading video game?
Well, okay, it’s not exactly a game; it’s a simulator designed to teach you to
day trade. The RapidSP Day Trading Simulator, available at www.trading
simulatorsoftware.com, gives you all the excitement of day trading with-
out risk to your capital and without the sales pitch. It’s a low-cost, low-risk
way to enjoy the day trading experience.
A simulation doesn’t involve real money. Many traders find that when their
own money is on the line, they don’t trade as well as when they trade for fake
money or for someone else. That’s part of the psychology of facing the mar-
kets, and you can get some tips for managing that in Chapter 8.
Trade in Demo Accounts
Simulators are a good way to learn day trading, but they cost money. If you’re
looking for a free way to try day trading in general, or if you are a day trader
thinking of adding new securities to your repertoire, you can trade in demo
accounts. Many brokerage firms (see Chapter 6 for a list of some that deal
with day traders) allow prospective customers to start with a demonstration
account, both to check out the broker’s capabilities and to see if day trading
is right for you. Some brokers even run contests, where prospective traders
trade paper accounts (that is, not real money), and the winners receive
money for a real trading account.
305
Chapter 20: Ten Alternatives to Day Trading

If you are thinking of day trading, you owe it to yourself to do some simula-
tion to work through your trading system. And if you just like the idea of play-
ing around with trading, paper trading in a demonstration account can help
you have fun without risking your hard-earned money.
Brokerage firms offer demo accounts to entice you to buy, and you can
expect that someone will call or email you to see how things went. You can
cut down on clutter in your email in-box by opening a free Web mail account
just for your demo trading. Google Mail (www.gmail.com), Hotmail (www.
hotmail.com), and Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) are among the companies
offering free email accounts.
Sign Up for a Trading Contest
Each year, some prominent financial media companies offer trading contests.
People can sign up for them, manage a paper portfolio (investing or day 
trading, as they please), and the participant with the greatest return wins a
cash prize.
Three popular ones are
 Forbes Stock Game: www.forbesstockgame.com.
 TheStreet.com’s Beat the Street Contest: www.thestreet.com.
 CNBC’s Million Dollar Portfolio Challenge: www.cnbc.com.
These offer all the fun of trading with none of the risk — although cheating
scandals in 2007 mean that the future of these contests is up in the air.
Consider also that they offer all the fun of trading with none of the oversight
of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.

Appendix
Resources for Day Traders
A
s much as I hate to admit it, Day Trading for Dummies doesn’t tell you 
all you need to know to get started in day trading. This appendix lists
books, Web sites, periodicals, and other resources offering trading strategies
and techniques and ideas on managing risk, taxes, and stress.
Great Books for Great Trading
Have a shelf that looks a little bare? Fill it up with a few of these beauties.
Basic trading guides
The following books offer nuts-and-bolts information on day trading.
Barron’s Dictionary of Finance and Investment Terms, by John Downes
and Jordan Elliott Goodman (Barron’s Educational Series)
This is not the same Barron’s as the weekly newspaper, but it’s about as indis-
pensable to investors. This dictionary is a handy guide to the technical terms
and jargon you’ll come across when trading. It’s especially good when you
are almost, but not quite, sure of what a word means.
Capital Gains, Minimal Taxes, by Kaye A. Thomas (Fairmark Press)
Every profitable trade triggers a taxable event, and a trader who is not paying
attention can end up giving up all her returns to the Internal Revenue Service.
That’s not good. When writing your business plan and developing your trad-
ing strategy, you need to consider the tax implications. This book helps.
Day Trading the Currency Market: Technical and Fundamental
Strategies to Profit from Market Swings, by Kathy Lien (Wiley)
The foreign exchange (forex) market is becoming popular with day traders,
but it’s a little different from the stock and futures markets. It relies heavily
on leverage, and market participants have more motivations than simply

hedging or speculating. If you are interested in trading currencies, this book
can help you get started.
The Electronic Day Trader: Successful Strategies for On-line Trading,
by Marc Friedfertig and George West (McGraw-Hill)
This book is mostly about day trading in the stock market. It covers technical
analysis, trading strategies, and some of the market psychology that affects
buy and sell decisions.
Mastering the Trade, by John F. Carter (McGraw-Hill)
The author, an experienced trader, walks day traders and swing traders
through the ins and outs of the markets, including specific advice on different
trading opportunities. He includes charts and data that explain when to place
a trade and when to close it out. It’s practical, useful, and detailed.
The New Money Management: A Framework for 
Asset Allocation, by Ralph Vince (Wiley)
Money management can keep traders in the game longer while maximizing
potential returns. It’s a key discipline that can mean the difference between
long-run success and failure. Unfortunately, many day traders completely
overlook money management. (I cover this topic in Chapter 2.)
The Tax Guide for Traders, by Robert A. Green (McGraw-Hill)
This detailed book will help you plan your trading strategy with tax efficiency
in mind, and it will save you time and money when working with your tax
accountant. Green writes specifically for the professional trader, so he knows
what tricks and traps await you when it comes to the IRS.
Trading Rules that Work: The 28 Lessons Every Trader 
Must Master, by Jason Jankovsky (Wiley)
If it were possible to get rich knowing a handful of specific trading indicators,
every trader would retire and run huge charitable foundations. But it’s not
that easy. Instead, a disciplined, professional approach to the market makes a
difference over the long run. This book is a useful overview of different trad-
ing rules, why they work, and how traders should apply them.
Technical analysis guides
Technical analysis is a system of looking at price and volume trends to deter-
mine supply and demand levels in the market. Supply and demand, of course,
drive price changes, so it’s pretty darn useful. Here are a few books that
cover technical analysis in depth.
308
Day Trading For Dummies 

Candlestick Charting Explained, by Gregory Morris (McGraw-Hill)
Candlestick charts were developed in Japan and are the basis of a system of
technical analysis that’s popular with short-term traders, including day
traders. This book explains how to identify and use candlestick patterns.
Mind Over Markets: Power Trading with Market Generated
Information, by James Dalton, Eric Jones, and Robert 
Bevan Dalton (Traders Press)
Don’t let the title fool you. This book is not about trading psychology.
Instead, it covers a price charting and technical analysis system in great
depth, especially the relationships between price changes and volume
changes. The system, called market profile, is especially useful for day
traders working in futures markets. 
Tape Reading and Market Tactics, by B. Neill Humphrey 
(Marketplace Books)
In the early part of the 20th century, traders looked at price and volume infor-
mation that came across ticker tapes. Traders still rely on an analysis of price
and volume information, just with different tools. This book was originally
written in 1931, but many day traders find Humphrey’s advice on what to
look for and what to avoid when looking at price data still holds true.
Technical Analysis for Dummies, by Barbara Rockefeller (Wiley)
Day traders use technical analysis to help gauge market activity, and this
book is a detailed guide on reading charts and applying the information to
trading in an intelligent way. What else would a For Dummies book offer?
Schools of price theory
Most day traders take an eclectic approach to the markets. They find a few
indicators that help them and apply them to the situation in the market. Over
time, they refine their system, but some traders rely on specific theories for
how prices should move. Here are some basic texts on them.
Dow Theory Today, by Richard Russell (Fraser Publishing)
The Dow Theory, developed by Charles Dow, publisher of The Wall Street
Journal, predicts overall market performance based on the performance 
of different industry sectors. These essays from the 1950s and 1960s explain
the theory and how market analysts can use it to figure out where prices 
are going.
309
Appendix: Resources for Day Traders

Elliott Wave Principle: Key to Market Behavior, by 
A.J. Frost and Robert R. Prechter, Jr. (Wiley)
The Elliott Wave theory is a strange animal. It looks for really long-term pat-
terns in the markets — over decades and even centuries — based on the
Fibonacci series, a number series found in nature. It’s not widely used, but
some traders swear by it.
How to Make Profits in Commodities, by W.D. Gann (Lambert Gann)
It’s not exactly an easy read, but many analysts believe that Gann’s system
can help them figure out how prices change over time. Reissued in 1976, the
text dates from the 1940s. Some find it dated, others think it’s timeless.
How to Make Money in Stocks: A Winning System in Good 
Times or Bad, by William J. O’Neill (McGraw-Hill)
William O’Neill’s system will be of most interest to people who are swing trad-
ing or investing in common stock, but it might help day traders understand
what other participants in the market are looking at when they place orders.
The book explains momentum investing, which looks for stocks of companies
with improving business trends and performance.
Trading psychology
Good traders are mentally tough. They need the confidence to face the
market, the decisiveness to place orders, and the fortitude to take losses —
and do it against a faceless mix of everyone else trading that day. Several
books address trading psychology specifically; others on mental strength are
also popular with traders because their lessons can be applied to the markets.
The Art of War, by Sun Tzu
It seems like every trader I’ve ever met has a copy of The Art of War. It’s a
Chinese text describing military strategy, including the importance of mental
toughness and strict discipline. First translated into a European language in
1782, several different versions and translations are in print. 
Awaken the Giant Within, by Anthony Robbins (Pocket Books)
This is a basic self-help book that’s popular with all sorts of folks. Many
traders find that Robbins’ methods give them confidence and help them 
control their minds when they are trading.

The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind, 
by Gustave LeBon (Dover Books)
In the 19th century, Gustave LeBon wrote this treatise on crowd psychology.
He didn’t think much of his fellow human being, but many traders have found
that his insights explain some short-term irrational behavior in the markets.
Understanding why traders make mistakes can help you make profits.
The Disciplined Trader: Developing Winning Attitudes, 
by Mark Douglas (Prentice Hall)
Mark Douglas is a trader who lost a lot of money and tried to figure out why.
As he did that, he developed a great deal of insight into the psychological
aspects of trading. Namely, the market doesn’t care about who is trading in it,
so every trader is responsible for his or her own results. Many experienced
day traders swear by the information in this book.
The Inner Game of Trading, by Robert Koppel (McGraw-Hill)
Day trading requires a lot of mental discipline. A trader has a short time to
make a profit, and some panic at the idea. Others succumb to doubt, fear,
greed, and hope, using emotion to avoid making good trading decisions. This
is a classic guide to managing the emotional aspects of trading. The author
has written other books on different aspects of trading psychology as well.
History and memoir
I’m not willing to accept the Elliott Wave and say that all market movements
are part of overarching trends, but market history — like all history — tends
to repeat. Why? Because people are people, and no matter how commerce
and the economy changes, people do the same things over and over again. 
Double Down: Reflections on Gambling and Loss, by 
Frederick and Stephen Barthelme (Harvest Books)
Want to see what a gambling addiction looks like? The Barthelme brothers
are writers and English professors who inherited $250,000 from their 
father’s estate and then lost it all playing casino blackjack. It’s a story of 
how complicated relationships with money cause people to make bad deci-
sions. For a day trader, this book tells what happens when people cannot
place limits for emotional reasons, a route to ruin in the casino or during 
the trading day.

Fortune’s Formula: The Untold Story of the Scientific Betting System
that Beat the Casinos and Wall Street, by William Poundstone 
(Hill and Wang)
Claude Shannon and John Kelly were Bell Labs scientists working on queuing
theories for long-distance calls when they stumbled on what is known as 
the Kelly Criterion: the ideal proportion of money to bet can be found by 
the ratio of your edge in the market divided by the odds of winning. The
“edge/odds” formula can be used by day traders to figure out how much
money to allocate to a trade. This book explains how the system works,
though it never quite proves that it works when applied to legitimate casinos
or to trading.
Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, by Edwin LeFevre (Wiley)
This classic, written before the 1929 market crash, tells of the adventures 
of Jesse Livermore, one of the most successful traders of his time. It’s a 
disguised memoir of speculation, with a character named Larry Livingston
standing in for Livermore. Some traders like it for the lessons they can learn
from Livermore, others are just amused by how unchanged the art of day
trading is despite dramatic changes in technology.
Organizations for Day Traders
Okay, let’s face it: Day traders are an independent lot, and there aren’t many
organizations for them, nor many trade associations or lobbying groups. Still,
if you are trying to find other day traders out there, here are a few ideas.
Security Traders Association 
The STA (www.securitytraders.org) represents traders at brokerage
firms and investment companies. Much of its focus is regulatory, but on occa-
sion, local chapters sponsor meetings and events that might be of interest to
a day trader. 
Market Technicians Association
Day traders rely on technical analysis to help them make trading decisions. 
If you really want to study the subject in depth, the MTA (www.mta.org) 
will help you. The organization is mostly aimed at people who do technical
312
Day Trading For Dummies 

analysis for large trading firms, but anyone interested in the topic may join.
Local chapters bring in successful traders to talk about their techniques.
Meetups
Meetup.com is a Web site that lets people with similar interests find each
other and get together wherever they live. Many Meetup groups are designed
for day traders. Go to http://daytraders.meetup.com to find day
traders, and to www.meetup.com/topics/fin/inv/ to find groups that
cover foreign exchange (forex), commodities, or other aspects of trading 
and investing. 
The Trader’s Internet
Day trading was made possible by the Internet. When high-speed connec-
tivity to market data became affordable, almost anyone could trade with 
the same speed as folks working on the exchange floor or a brokerage 
trading desk. And yet, the Internet can be a terrible distraction to a day
trader or to anyone else working alone. Here are some good Web sites for 
day traders, but you might want to limit your use of them to before and after
trading hours.
Bill Cara
Bill Cara isn’t a day trader, but he is a full-time investor who pays careful
attention to the markets. Each day, he records his observations about what’s
happening on his blog, www.billcara.com. It’s good reading.
IndexArb.com
Interested in trading futures on the market indexes? This site, http://
indexarb.com, has useful information. It lists the premiums on different
contracts, offers strategies for different market conditions, and gives you
some good background information to help you make your own decisions.

Appendix: Resources for Day Traders

MyPivots.com
This site, www.mypivots.com, runs through key price and economic data
every morning, with trading calculators and a forum. It’s of most interest to
people working with eMini index futures.
TraderInterviews.com
Looking for something educational and inspirational for your MP3 player?
TraderInterviews.com (www.traderinterviews.com) features discussions
with different traders.
Trader Mike
Every day, Michael Seneadza, a day trader, updates his blog at www.
tradermike.net. It includes his trading journal, thoughts on the markets,
and his own advice on day trading, which he admits is not definitive. This
blog is often thought-provoking.
Traders Laboratory
If you are interested in meeting other day traders online, finding Web-based
seminars, reading traders’ blogs, or checking out economic release calen-
dars, then Traders Laboratory, www.traderslaboratory.com, is the site
for you.
Other Mainstream Media
Even though traders are hooked to real-time market data through the
Internet, they still look to some old-style sources for information.
Barron’s
Barron’s (www.barrons.com) is a weekly financial newspaper published by
Dow Jones & Company. The primary emphasis is on long-term investing, but it
carries in-depth market analysis and often interviews outstanding traders. In
314
Day Trading For Dummies 

addition, the regular “Electronic Trader” column carries news and ratings of
online brokerage firms, many of which specialize in services for day traders.
CNBC
CNBC (www.cnbc.com) is a cable channel that carries news and information
about the markets. Some traders keep it running in the background while
they trade. Others watch the shows before and after market hours. 
Investor’s Business Daily
This newspaper, www.investors.com, is published by the William O’Neill
Company, which also publishes charts and technical analysis systems used
by stock investors. (See Chapter 16.) Every morning, IBD has new trade ideas
and market analysis for active traders, especially those in the stock market.
