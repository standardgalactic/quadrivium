Richard J. Haier
Professor Emeritus
University of California, Irvine
P
rofessor Richard J. Haier is Professor 
Emeritus in the School of Medicine at the 
University of California, Irvine, where he has 
been teaching and conducting research since 1986. 
In 1971, he received his B.A. in Psychology from 
the University at Buffalo, The State University of 
New York, and in 1975, he received his Ph.D. in Psychology from Johns 
Hopkins University. Professor Haier was a Staff Fellow at the National 
Institute of Mental Health from 1976 to 1980, and he was on the faculty of 
Brown University’s Alpert Medical School from 1980 to 1985.
Professor Haier has published more than 135 research articles and 
book chapters. His main research interest is investigating the structural 
and functional neuroanatomy of higher cognitive processes, especially 
intelligence. In 1988, he and his colleagues conducted the first modern 
functional brain imaging study of intelligence with positron emission 
tomography (PET) and proposed a hypothesis linking good performance on 
an intelligence test to efficient brain function. Professor Haier’s more recent 
research with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has identified specific 
brain areas where gray and white matter features correlate to the g factor 
of intelligence and other intelligence factors. In 2007, he and Dr. Rex Jung 
published an extensive review of all neuroimaging studies of intelligence 
and proposed a model called the parieto-frontal integration theory (P-FIT) of 
human intelligence. 
Since 1990, Professor Haier has served on the editorial board of Intelligence, 
and in 2009, he was a guest editor for a special issue on neuroimaging 
studies. He also has reviewed grant proposals related to intelligence for 
the National Science Foundation. Professor Haier works with cognitive 
psychologists and other investigators new to intelligence research to ensure 
awareness of psychometric and conceptual issues necessary for designing 
i

informative neuroimaging studies. This work was the main focus of his 
service on the editorial board of NeuroImage and as a reviewer for Nature 
Reviews Neuroscience, Psychological Review, Psychological Bulletin, 
Journal of Experimental Psychology, and granting agencies in the United 
Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Canada. 
Major themes of Professor Haier’s work for the last 25 years are the 
application of the powerful techniques of neuroimaging to the study of 
individual differences in intelligence and the expansion and promotion 
of interest in the field beyond psychometrics. These ideas were the basis 
for invited lectures and presentations sponsored by the National Science 
Foundation, the National Academy of Sciences, the European Molecular 
Biology Organization, Cold Spring Harbor, the New York Academy of 
Sciences, the American Enterprise Institute, and La Caixa Foundation 
in Spain. He also has spoken at numerous academic departments and 
conferences in the United States and abroad. Professor Haier’s research 
has been funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Office of Naval 
Research, the MacArthur Foundation, and other private foundations. His 
work has been featured on NOVA scienceNOW, NPR, CNN, and CBS Sunday 
Morning and in numerous newspaper and magazine reports, including those 
in Newsweek and Time. In 2009, Professor Haier summarized his intelligence 
research for the public in an article in Scientific American Mind. In 2012, he 
received the Distinguished Contributor Award from the International Society 
for Intelligence Research. ■

Scope:
T
he concept of human intelligence is sometimes controversial, but 
two things are surely true. First, no matter how “intelligence” 
is defined, you know someone who is not as intelligent as you 
are. Second, intelligence has something to do with the brain. New 
neuroscience tools, especially brain imaging, are revealing what a 
smart brain looks like and helping researchers understand the neural 
mechanisms of what makes one person learn faster, remember more, 
and reason better than another. 
This course begins with the challenge of defining intelligence for scientific 
study. Savants show one aspect of specific mental abilities, but there is 
also strong evidence that all mental abilities have a common general factor 
of intelligence—called g. Measuring g and other factors of intelligence 
depends mostly on IQ-type tests, which the course will explain, including 
what these tests do and do not measure. Evidence from long-term studies of 
genius and IQ over the life span will give some insights about the power and 
value of intelligence tests, especially as we all navigate the complexities of  
everyday life.
Some popular alternative concepts of intelligence that do not focus on the 
g-factor include practical intelligence and multiple intelligences, but as you 
will see, the research evidence for their validity is more limited. The role of 
early childhood experiences on intelligence is also surprisingly controversial, 
especially because the role of genetics is increasingly well supported by 
research, as the course will review. The concept of epigenetics is important 
because it potentially reverses the idea that a genetic basis for intelligence 
means that intelligence is fixed. 
Whether intelligence is mostly influenced by genes or by environmental/
cultural factors, any effects must work on the brain’s biology. Brain 
imaging has made major advances to help understand the neural basis 
of intelligence in adults and in children. This course will review some

of these studies and present several surprising results. These studies 
also show that measures of intelligence are not meaningless artifacts 
of statistical methods because test scores are related to specific brain 
features. This allows a more objective review of older controversies 
about sex and race differences in mental abilities. The course will 
update research findings about these persistent controversies. One of 
the newest mysteries to consider is that average intelligence test scores 
are slowly increasing around the world for reasons unknown. One hope 
is that older controversies and newer mysteries can be addressed with 
novel ways to assess intelligence based on measuring brain processing 
speed. Another issue of renewed interest from brain imaging studies is 
how creativity may be related to intelligence. 
Overall, the new neuroscience of intelligence research leads inexorably 
to speculation about whether brain mechanisms can be tweaked 
to enhance intelligence with brain training or by manipulating 
neurochemistry or even by genetic engineering. It may be possible not 
only to raise low intelligence, but also to increase high intelligence 
to new levels. There are already attempts to do so. These possibilities 
raise a number of issues for child rearing, education, and social policy. 
One central issue is whether we have a moral obligation to increase 
intelligence if we could. Assuming that more intelligence is always 
better than less, would you take an IQ pill, or prevent your child from 
taking one? Research on intelligence is progressing so that such choices 
could be real in the not-so-distant future. ■

What Is Intelligence?
Lecture 1
T
his course is about the science of intelligence. The course will 
explore some of the things we know about intelligence and some 
of the things we are learning; we’ve already learned a lot, but many 
mysteries remain, and most of them are surrounded by controversies. In this 
lecture, you will examine some basic concepts necessary for defining and 
measuring intelligence, and you will be supplied with a tentative answer to 
the following question: Where in the brain is intelligence? In addition, you 
will consider what the new science of intelligence means for you.
Intelligence and IQ Tests
• 
The American Psychological Association Task Force on 
Intelligence defines intelligence in the following way: “Individuals 
differ from one another in their ability to understand complex ideas, 
to adapt effectively to the environment, to learn from experience, 
to engage in various forms of reasoning, to overcome obstacles by  
taking thought.”
• 
The main element in common to all definitions of intelligence is 
that it is a general ability. IQ, mental ability, and intelligence are all 
used in the same way to describe this general ability.
• 
In every branch of science, definitions of basic concepts evolve 
over time and get more and more precise as measurements get 
better and allow finer-grained questions. All of the definitions of 
intelligence have the same inherent challenge for researchers: How 
do you measure intelligence to do empirical research? We expect 
that as measurements improve, the definition of intelligence will 
become more precise.
• 
IQ scores are derived from a battery of tests, so the single IQ score 
actually represents a range of mental abilities. That’s why it’s 
a good measure of general intelligence. IQ scores for very large, 

4
Lecture 1: What Is Intelligence?
random samples of people are normally distributed. Many variables 
are normally distributed in a large population. These properties are 
the same regardless of whether we are talking about height, income, 
or intelligence.
• 
A normal distribution is also called a bell curve. IQ scores typically 
have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15; 50 percent 
of people score above 100, and 50 percent score below 100. The 
average IQ is 85 to 114, and 68 percent of people fall into this range. 
Only 16 percent of people have scores of 85 or lower, and 14 percent 
of people have scores of 115 to 129. The top two percent of people 
have IQ scores of 130 to 145; these scores are higher than 98 percent 
of the population. IQ scores over 145 indicate the top 0.1 percent.
• 
IQ scores predict general learning ability. People with IQs below 80 
to 85 generally learn slower and require more concrete, step-by-step 
instruction. People with IQs over 115 generally learn more abstractly 
and seek out information on their own. In the middle IQ range, many 
individuals certainly can learn complex material, but it may take 
longer with more individual instruction. Keep in mind that these are 
not perfect relationships, and there are certainly exceptions.
• 
IQ predicts many real-world things. IQ scores predict not only 
things like education level, income, and job performance, but 
0.1%      2%          14%       34%       34%       14%           2%      0.1%

they also predict health and even mortality. However, IQ does not 
predict many other important things, like happiness, mental illness, 
honesty, or being a nice or likeable person.
Mental Abilities
• 
Researchers have learned that there are many mental abilities. Some 
are very specific, such as tests of spelling or the ability to mentally 
rotate 3-D objects; other tests assess more general abilities, such as 
memory or problem solving. 
• 
Over 100 years of research, we have learned about how such tests 
relate to each other. We have learned that different mental abilities 
are not independent: They are all related to each other, and the 
correlations among mental tests are always positive—which means 
that if you do well on one kind of mental ability test, you tend to do 
well on other tests. This is the core finding about intelligence, and 
it’s the basis for most modern research.
• 
The relationship among mental tests is called the structure of mental 
abilities. To picture the structure, imagine a three-level pyramid. At 
the bottom, there is a row of many different tests of specific abilities 
(16, for example). At the next level up, tests of similar abilities 
are grouped into more specific factors, such as reasoning, spatial 
ability, memory, speed of information processing, and vocabulary. 
Tests one, two, and three, for example, are all reasoning tests; tests 
seven, eight, and nine are all memory tests. However, all of the 
more specific factors also are related to each other.
• 
This is a key finding demonstrated over and over again. It strongly 
implies that all of the tests and factors derived from individual tests 
have something in common, and this common factor is called the 
general factor of intelligence, or g, which sits at the highest point 
on the pyramid. 
• 
Charles Spearman first described g over 100 years ago, and it is the 
basis of most definitions of intelligence used in research. It is not the 

6
same as IQ, but IQ scores are good estimates of g because most IQ 
tests are based on a battery of tests that sample many mental factors. 
• 
We have many mental abilities—from multiplying in your head to 
picking stocks to naming state capitals. “Intelligence” is a catchall 
word that means the mental abilities most related to responding to 
everyday problems and navigating the environment.
• 
IQ is a test score based on a subset of the mental abilities that relate to 
everyday intelligence. IQ is a good predictor of everyday intelligence. 
The g-factor is what is common to all mental abilities, and it is a 
fairly large part of IQ. Whereas everyday intelligence and IQ tests 
can be influenced by many factors, including social and cultural ones, 
the g-factor is thought to be more biological and genetic.
• 
Kim Peek was the model for the autistic savant character in Rain 
Man, a 1988 movie with Dustin Hoffman. Kim could answer many 
kinds of questions for just about any historical figure or event, and

he could answer many other questions based on his ability to recall 
7,600 books, which he read by paging through them and scanning 
each page quickly. Kim had a low IQ and could not work or care for 
himself, but he had an amazing memory and recall ability. How he 
did this is not understood, but clearly extraordinary memory is not 
the same as high intelligence. 
• 
Savants are quite rare. They usually excel at a narrow mental skill 
to a level that often appears to be in the genius range, but they also 
typically have low IQs. In many cases, savants have very specific 
abilities with little if any g. 
• 
Examples of savants show that powerful independent abilities can 
exist, but they also demonstrate the problems that can arise when 
g is lacking. Most people have g and independent factors, and two 
people with the same level of g can have different patterns of mental 
strengths and weaknesses. Savants demonstrate the differences 
between specific and general mental abilities.
• 
The IBM computer Watson, which beat two all-time Jeopardy! 
champions, demonstrates a specific ability to analyze verbal 
information and solve problems based on the meaning of words. 
This is an amazing accomplishment, but it does not show  
the g-factor.
Intelligent Brains
• 
Why are some people smarter than others? Does everyone have 
equal potential for learning all subjects? The answers must 
have something to do with the brain, but where in the brain is 
intelligence? We can ask this about g and about specific factors. Is 
one brain organized to be better at math and science, and another 
brain better at writing or creativity? If so, how did these brains get 
that way? What is the interplay between genetics and experience as 
they influence intelligence? 
• 
In 1988, the first brain imaging study of intelligence was conducted 
using an imaging technology called positron emission tomography 

8
(PET), which is a way to measure glucose use in the brain. This was 
done while people worked on a test of intelligence to see what brain 
areas “light up” during problem solving. Imaging technology has 
dramatically changed intelligence research. 
• 
The parieto-frontal integration theory, or P-FIT, is a model that is 
based on a review of 37 imaging studies of intelligence. The P-FIT 
identifies a network of brain areas. The key areas are mostly in the 
parietal lobes—the sides toward the back of the brain—and in the 
frontal lobes. Intelligence may depend on how information flows 
around this network. If we could measure this information flow and 
how it may differ among people, we might devise a completely new 
way to measure intelligence from brain imaging. 
• 
Many imaging studies show that intelligence test scores are related 
to measurements of brain structure and function. This virtually 
eliminates older concerns that intelligence test scores don’t assess 
anything real or important. 
• 
Can we increase intelligence? Today, the short answer is no—we 
can’t increase intelligence. Some recent studies suggest that you 
can train your brain to increase your IQ, but the research on this 
subject is not at all settled. The longer answer is yes—we might be 
able to enhance intelligence in the near future.
• 
For example, research is already showing that drugs can focus 
attention during test taking, that electrical stimulation to the brain 
improves learning, and that manipulating genes improves learning. 
All neuroscience studies of intelligence will ultimately lead to 
attempts to increase both g and even specific factors.

Assessing Intelligence
Lecture 2
I
n this lecture, you will learn about measuring intelligence, focusing on IQ 
testing. Measurement is required to do scientific research on intelligence. 
No single test may be a perfect measure of a single definition, but as 
research findings accumulate, both definition and measurement evolve, and 
our understanding of the complexities increases. This lecture will focus 
on two topics: the history of IQ tests and how they work—including the 
kinds of items found on the most widely used tests—and some of the issues 
surrounding what intelligence tests actually measure.
The History of IQ Tests
• 
Psychometrics is the measurement of psychological phenomena 
like intelligence—often with paper-and-pencil tests. Most 
intelligence testing is based on psychometric approaches that 
rely heavily on statistical methods, including the properties of the 
normal distribution curve. Many psychologists believe that IQ tests 
are one of the great achievements in psychology, although there is 
considerable controversy about them. 
• 
In the early part of the 20th century, Alfred Binet and his collaborator 
Theodore Simon devised the first IQ test to identify children who 
mentally could not benefit from ordinary school instruction. The 
IQ test was born as an objective means for identifying low mental 
ability in children so that they could get special attention.
• 
The test constructed by Binet and Simon consisted of several 
subtests that sampled different mental abilities with an emphasis on 
tests of judgment because Binet felt that judgment was a key aspect 
of intelligence. He gave each test to many children and developed 
average scores for each age and sex. He then was able to say at 
what age level any individual child scored. This was called the 
child’s mental age. 

11
• 
A German psychologist named William Stern took the concept 
of mental age another step further. He divided mental age by 
chronological age. This resulted in an IQ score that was the ratio 
of a child’s mental age (averaged across all of the subtests) divided 
by the child’s chronological age. Multiplying this ratio by 100  
avoided fractions.
• 
The point of these early tests was to find children who were not 
doing very well in school—relative to their peers—and get them 
special attention. The Binet-Simon test actually worked reasonably 
well for this purpose. However, one problem with the concept of 
mental age is that it is hard to assess after about age 16. As a result, 
the Binet-Simon test was not really useful or intended for adults.
• 
The IQ score is a measure of a child relative to his or her peers. 
Even today, newer IQ tests based on a different calculation show 
how an individual scores relative to his or her peers. IQ scores are 
not absolute measures of a quantity; an IQ point is not always the 
same in terms of a quantity of intelligence.
• 
Nevertheless, the Binet-Simon test was an important advance for 
assessing the abilities of children in an objective way. The Binet-
Simon test was translated to English and redone at Stanford 
University in the 1920s by Louis Terman, and the test is now known 
as the Stanford-Binet test. Today, the Stanford-Binet test has been 
revised and updated many times. One key change is in the way IQ 
is calculated. Mental age is no longer used; IQ is now based on 
deviation scores.
• 
The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) was designed for 
adults, and it is the most widely used intelligence test today. The 
current version consists of a battery of 10 core subtests and another 
five supplemental subtests. Together, they sample a broad range of 
mental abilities. The WAIS uses deviation scores to calculate an 
overall IQ score.

12
• 
IQ scores are normally distributed in large populations, and so 
are subtest scores. The tests were developed so that this would be 
true—that is, items that proved not to be normally distributed were 
eliminated from the test.
• 
Each subtest has been taken by a large number of males and females 
of different ages. These are the norm groups. Each norm has an 
average score called the mean, and the spread of scores around the 
mean is measured by a statistic called the standard deviation.
• 
The average deviation across all of the subtests is used to calculate 
the deviation IQ for the full battery. One standard deviation above 
the mean ranks the person higher than 84 percent of the norm 
group; one standard deviation IQ below the mean ranks the person 
at about the 16th percentile.
• 
The WAIS can be divided into specific factors other than the full-
scale IQ score. The structure of the WAIS looks just like the pyramid 
structure of mental abilities from the last lecture. At the bottom are 
the individual subtests. They are grouped at the next highest level 
into factors of verbal comprehension, working memory, perceptual 
organization, and processing speed. These four specific factors are 
grouped into more general factors of verbal IQ and performance IQ, 
and these two broad factors have a common general factor defined 
by the total IQ score, called full-scale IQ, which is a good estimate 
of the g-factor.
Sample IQ Test Items
• 
Intelligence tests fall into two categories. The first is based on 
individual testing, in which one tester administers the test to one 
person at a time. This usually takes at least two hours and can take 
all day depending on how tests are given. Additionally, it can be 
quite expensive.
• 
The other category is based on group testing. One tester can 
give the test directions to a group and then let each person work 
simultaneously without interaction with the test administrator. 
Lecture 2: Assessing Intelligence

13
Depending on the group tests used, this can take less than an hour 
or all day. Group testing is more efficient and typically costs less.
• 
The WAIS is an individually administered test. One of its subtests 
is called General Information. Example questions include  
the following.
○

What is the capital of Italy?

What is the approximate population of India? (+/– 200 million)

• 
Another WAIS subtest is called Digit Span. The test administrator 
reads a series of digits, and when finished, you repeat the digits 
back in order. This test has two parts: In the first part, you repeat 
the digits in order; in the second part, you repeat the digits 
backward—in reverse order. The more digits you repeat, the 
higher your score. This test does not seem as vulnerable to bias as  
general information.
• 
Answering or not answering any one item, or doing poorly on any 
one subtest, does not mean that you are not smart; it’s the total of 
all items that matter for general intelligence, and not all subtests 
are equally good indicators of g. The term g-loading refers to the 
amount of g represented in a test.
• 
The WAIS is really a battery of separate tests, and the combined 
scores (into one IQ number) estimate g. There are many other 
tests that also estimate g, including Raven’s progressive matrices, 
analogies, and SATs. 
• 
The Raven’s test can be given in a group format and takes less than 
an hour. It’s one of the best tests to estimate g. It’s a nonverbal test 
of abstract reasoning. The underlying pattern or rule can be quite 
difficult to infer, but because of its simple administration, this test 
has been used in many research studies. Scores on this test can be 
converted to approximate WAIS IQ scores. Performance on a test 
like this seems fairly independent of education or even culture.
• 
Analogy tests also are very good estimators of g.

Originally, the SAT was called the Scholastic Aptitude Test, 
then it was renamed the Scholastic Achievement Test, and now 
it’s called the Scholastic Assessment Test. Achievement tests 
Lecture 2: Assessing Intelligence

15
measure what you have learned. Aptitude tests measure what you 
might learn, especially in a specific area. The SATs, especially 
the overall total score, are also a good estimator of g because the 
problems require reasoning. Like IQ scores, the meaning of SAT 
scores is based on percentiles. Both IQ scores and SAT scores are  
normally distributed.
• 
Part of the confusion is that achievement scores, aptitude scores, 
and intelligence scores are all related to each other. They are not 
independent. The g-factor is common to all tests of mental ability, 
and the g-factor is related to learning ability. Your performance 
on achievement tests is related to the general factor—just like IQ 
scores and aptitude test scores are related to g.
Issues with IQ Tests
• 
The main problem with the IQ score is that it is not a real ratio 
scale, which means that there is no true zero. IQ scores rank a 
person relative to other people, so a person with an IQ score of 140 
is not really twice as smart as a person with a score of 70. For IQ, 
it’s the percentile that counts.
• 
Intelligence test scores only estimate intelligence because we don’t 
yet know how to measure intelligence as a quantity, like measuring 
liquid in liters or temperature in degrees. Whatever you think 
about intelligence tests and IQ scores, they do predict success in 
many aspects of everyday life, and IQ scores are related to brain 
characteristics. These relationships help establish the validity of 
intelligence tests. 
• 
Possibly the most controversial topic in all of psychology is 
whether intelligence tests are biased against any groups. Test bias 
has been studied extensively for decades, and although test abuse 
certainly happens, most researchers find that intelligence tests are 
not inherently biased against any one group. This is not to say that 
factors like education and culture don’t matter.

General Intelligence in Everyday Life
Lecture 3
T
his lecture is based largely on the research of Linda Gottfredson, a 
sociologist at the University of Delaware who studies intelligence. 
In this lecture, you will be exposed to data that shows that general 
intelligence is related to many aspects of life—not just academics. In fact, 
some of the data may surprise you. First, this lecture will examine 10 areas 
of everyday life and briefly illustrate the importance of intelligence in each 
one. Then, it will introduce you to actual data about what g predicts and 
address whether any of the data have implications for public policy.
Intelligence in Everyday Life
• 
It is important to realize that g does not predict everything, but it 
predicts best wherever demands for general thinking skills are 
highest—that is, most g-loaded. The following are 10 life areas 
where g matters.
1.	
School success: It’s an old question as to whether some kids 
should get into the honors or advanced classes based only on 
intelligence test scores, but intelligence does matter when it 
comes to speed of learning, especially for advanced material.
2.	
Income and managing money: A very cynical statement—“If 
you divided all of the money in the world equally among 
everyone, in six months, the same people would have it 
back”—could be a statement, even an extreme one, about 
the importance of intelligence for understanding money-
management concepts. 
3.	
Prescriptions and medical instructions: Many medical 
directions are quite complex. Should doctors assume that 
all patients understand equally well? Drug information from 
the pharmacy tends to be written at a fairly high level, so  
lower-IQ people may have more misunderstandings and less 
effective compliance.

18
4.	
Accidents and health: Low IQ is associated with more accidents 
and shorter longevity. Misunderstanding of health and safety 
issues is more common.
5.	
Using computers and other digital devices: This requires some 
basic problem-solving skills.
6.	
Reading bus or train schedules: The iconic map of the London 
Underground rail system shows complex information in a 
relatively simple visual way, but this is the exception—not  
the rule. 
7.	
Filling out employment or government forms: If you think 
you’re smart, try filling out your own tax forms.
8.	
Vocational choice: Can you really be anything you want to be, 
irrespective of your IQ? This is a key issue about the extent to 
which intelligence is a limiting factor.
9.	
Job success: Which is more important: IQ or emotional 
intelligence? As jobs become more complex, IQ may be 
necessary, but not sufficient without the ability to get along 
with other people.
10.	 Basic life decisions: Watch a few episodes of the television 
show Judge Judy. Certainly not all of the cases involve people 
with lower intelligence, but you will see real examples of how 
poor reasoning and poor decision making create all kinds of life 
complexities and problems. 
What Does g Predict?
• 
In the normal distribution of IQs, lower IQs, around 70, usually 
mean that learning is slow, simple, and requires concrete, step-by-
step teaching with individual instruction. Learning complex material 
is often not possible. IQs around 80 to 90 still require very explicit, 
structured, individual instruction. When it comes to learning by 
written materials, IQs of at least 100 are usually required, and 
Lecture 3: General Intelligence in Everyday Life

19
college-level learning usually works best at 115 and over. Higher 
IQs, over 130, usually mean more abstract, independent learning.
• 
According to scientific research, low IQs are associated with jobs 
that require a minimum of complex, independent reasoning. The 
jobs tend to follow specific routines, including assembling a simple 
product or being a nurse’s aide. As IQ increases to around 100, we 
see more complex jobs, such as bank tellers and police officers, and 
as IQ increases to around 115, more complex jobs are possible, such 
as managers, teachers, and accountants. Professions like attorneys, 
chemists, and business executives usually require higher IQs to 
finish the advanced schooling that is required and to perform at a 
high level of complexity.
• 
These are general trends. There are always exceptions, which 
is why an IQ score by itself is not usually used to make an 
important decision. IQ is usually considered in the context of  
other information.

• 
Even having a discussion about the role of intelligence in job success 
becomes uncomfortable because it implies serious limitations on 
personal achievement, and we want to believe the ideal that, in this 
country, people can succeed at anything they choose to do if they 
work hard enough. A reasonable caveat is that this is true providing 
that they have the appropriate level of mental ability.
• 
According to research, IQ matters more for success in complex jobs 
than for success in less complex jobs. Complex job performance 
is largely dependent on g, but of course, there are other factors, 
including how well one deals with other people. This is the concept 
of emotional intelligence. In other words, intelligence alone is not 
the whole story for predicting success.
• 
Studies suggest that expertise in any area requires at least 10,000 
hours of practice—that’s 1,250 eight-hour days, or about 3.4 years. 
Studies of chess grandmasters suggest that the group average IQ is 
about 100. This suggests that becoming a grandmaster may depend

more on practice of a specific ability like spatial memory than on 
general intelligence. Grandmasters may actually have a savant-like 
spatial memory, but the idea of a chess grandmaster being a giant 
intellect is not necessarily correct.
• 
Another way to look at the role of thinking skills and everyday life 
is based on functional literacy data. Functional literacy is assessed 
by the complexity of everyday tasks that a person can complete. 
Intelligence helps us navigate the problems of everyday life. 
Functional literacy is a good indicator of intelligence, and from data 
on functional literacy, we know that many people have trouble with 
daily tasks that some people may take for granted. 
IQ and Public Policy
• 
Should data inform or influence public policies? In a free and 
capitalist society, can lower-IQ individuals—in the bottom 15 
percent, for example—expect government help (federal, state, or 
local) that is not needed by higher-IQ individuals? Is the half of the 
population with IQs under 100 a permanent drag on society? Some 
people may think so. 
• 
The Bell Curve, written in 1994 by Richard Herrnstein and Charles 
Murray, is a controversial book that explores the role of intelligence 
in social policy. The main theme is that modern society increasingly 
requires and rewards people with the best reasoning skills—that is, 
high intelligence. Therefore, people in the bottom part of the normal 
distribution of IQ will be at a serious disadvantage for succeeding.
• 
This theme was detailed with over 900 pages of data and statistical 
analyses, but the part that aroused the most controversy was over 
one chapter that discussed racial IQ differences. This issue haunts 
all intelligence research.
• 
The issue surrounding The Bell Curve is whether public policy 
needs to recognize that people with low IQs need help navigating 
life—irrespective of race, background, or even why they might 
have low IQs. This is a fundamental issue today in politics, 

22
although the role of IQ is hardly mentioned as explicitly as it was in 
The Bell Curve. Most researchers would agree that research data on 
intelligence can only inform policy decisions, but the goals of the 
policy need to be determined through democratic means.
• 
The most practical general lesson for public policy that comes 
from intelligence research is to reduce complexity. Some examples 
for reduced complexity in everyday life include directions for 
medication and prescriptions, forms of every kind (think taxes), bus 
and train schedules, instruction manuals, and assembly manuals.
• 
The data that show that g is a key factor in life success imply that 
intelligence is a limiting factor and that you can only be anything 
you want to be if you have the required level of intelligence. This 
goes against the implication that work ethic can always trump 
mental ability.
• 
Malcolm Gladwell’s book Outliers emphasizes the role of luck. The 
following are four points about this view.
○
○
Whereas The Bell Curve documented the basic role 
intelligence plays in everyday life success, Malcolm Gladwell 
expresses a point of view that luck plays an even bigger role  
than intelligence. 
○
○
His examples are mostly anecdotal. It’s hard to prove whether 
luck or intelligence is more important for life success. Research 
on luck is hard to conceptualize. This is an argument that 
cannot be resolved by research.
○
○
Perhaps, Gladwell would agree that a person can be anything 
they wish to be given that they work hard and are lucky.
○
○
People who focus on intelligence typically do not downplay the 
role of luck; people who focus on luck should not downplay 
the role of intelligence. 
Lecture 3: General Intelligence in Everyday Life

• 
Intelligence predicts navigation of complexity in everyday 
life. Research so far suggests that IQ represents the single 
most useful tool in the tool kit of human mental abilities. 
Recognizing that people with lower IQs have the most difficulty 
in navigating modern life is something to consider in all aspects of  
designing society.

Lecture 4
T
his lecture will explore some alternative concepts that many people 
find more appealing than the g concept, but this lecture will also 
explain why they might not be. You will learn more details about the 
pyramid structure of mental abilities, including a statistical method called 
factor analysis, which allows us to find the groups of subtests that are most 
related to each other. This lecture will also discuss Sternberg’s theory of 
practical intelligence and Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences. Finally, 
you will learn about the influence of culture and social context on concepts 
of intelligence.
Factor Analysis
• 
Most theories about factors of intelligence start with the empirical 
observation that all tests of mental abilities are positively correlated 
with each other. This is called the positive manifold, and it was 
first described by Charles Spearman, who worked out statistical 
procedures for identifying the relationships among tests based on 
their correlations with one another. The basic method is called 
factor analysis.
• 
Let’s say that we measure height and weight in many people. We 
can graph each person by locating the height and weight as a single 
point, with height ranges on the x-axis and weight ranges on the 
y-axis. When we add points on the graph for each person, we begin 
to see an association: Taller people tend to weigh more. Height 
actually predicts weight, although not perfectly, so if we know that 
a person is 6.5 feet tall, we can predict that they will weigh around 
280 pounds.
• 
If height and weight were perfectly related, the points would all 
fall on a straight line, and we could predict one from the other 
without error. A perfect correlation has a value of 1 if a high value 
on one variable goes with a high value on the other variable.  
Lecture 4: To g or Not to g—Is That the Question?

25
A perfect negative correlation is where a low value on one variable 
predicts a high value on the other. A perfect negative correlation has 
a value of –1.
• 
Correlations between two variables are calculated based on how 
much each point deviates from the perfect line, and they always 
fall between +1 and –1. The higher the correlation—positive or 
negative—the stronger the relationship, and the better one variable 
predicts the other.

• 
Factor analysis is based on the pattern of correlations among several 
variables; in this case, we are interested in the correlations among 
different tests of mental abilities. The point of factor analysis is to 
identify what tests go with other tests—based not on content, but 
rather, on correlations of scores irrespective of content. The set 
of tests that go with each other define a factor because they have 
something in common that causes the correlation. Studies in this 
field typically apply factor analysis to data sets where hundreds or 
thousands of people have completed dozens of tests.
Models Based on Factor Analysis
• 
Louis Thurstone proposed a model of seven primary abilities that 
he claimed were independent of each other—that is, they were 
not correlated to each other, and there was no common g-factor. 
Thurstone’s seven abilities are as follows.
○
○
Spatial ability: measured by tests that require mental rotation 
of pictures and objects.
○
○
Perceptual speed: measured by tests of finding small differences 
in pictures as quickly as possible.
○
○
Number facility: measured by tests of computation.
○
○
Verbal comprehension: measured by tests of vocabulary.
○
○
Word fluency: measured by tests that require generating 
as many words as possible for a given category within a  
time limit.
○
○
Memory: tested by recall for digits and objects.
○
○
Inductive reasoning: measured by tests of analogies and logic.
• 
Thurstone’s model was not supported by subsequent research. The 
original research by Thurstone was flawed because the samples he 
used did not include individuals across the full range of possible 
scores—a statistical problem called restricted range that influences 
Lecture 4: To g or Not to g—Is That the Question?

27
the calculation of correlations. When researchers corrected this 
problem, they found that tests of the Thurstone primary abilities, in 
fact, are correlated to each other and that there is a g-factor. 
• 
Since Spearman and Thurstone and other pioneers of factor analysis, 
we now have hundreds of factor-analysis studies of intelligence on 
hundreds of mental tests completed by tens of thousands of people. 
There always is a g-factor, and g-factors derived from different test 
batteries correlate nearly perfectly with each other—as long as each 
battery has a sufficient number of tests that sample a broad range of 
mental abilities and the tests are given to people sampled from the 
broad range of ability. This fact is strong evidence for g.
• 
Raymond Cattell and his student John Horn proposed a model with 
two principal factors: fluid intelligence and crystallized intelligence. 
This distinction is widely recognized as an important evolution in 
the definition of intelligence. Both are related, so they are not in 
conflict with the g-factor. They represent factors just below g in the 
pyramid structure of mental abilities.
• 
Fluid intelligence refers to reasoning ability—both inductive 
and deductive—to solve novel problems, often using facts and 
information you already know. In many studies, fluid intelligence 
and the g-factor are correlated almost perfectly. Crystallized 
intelligence refers to what you know and the ability to learn facts 
and absorb information. 
• 
Crystallized intelligence is fairly stable over a life span, but fluid 
intelligence decreases with age. The likely explanation for these 
differences may lie in how age affects some parts of the brain more 
than others. Fluid intelligence peaks around age 15 and slowly 
declines. Crystallized intelligence steadily increases with age.
• 
Differences among factor models of intelligence and many other 
models have given some critics the idea that g is merely a statistical 
artifact of the factor analysis method. This criticism depends on 

28
very technical aspects of how factors are computed. The artifact 
view has been examined extensively, and it has never really held up. 
Sternberg’s Theory of Practical Intelligence
• 
Robert Sternberg is one of the most prolific intelligence researchers. 
Sternberg proposed a theory of practical intelligence—called the 
triarchic model—based on three kinds of intelligence: analytic 
(reasoning skills; most intelligence tests measure this kind of 
intelligence), creative (non-g-related ability to originate new 
ideas; it’s difficult to have psychometric tests to measure this), and 
practical (the emphasis in Sternberg’s model; it’s common sense, 
and it may include emotional intelligence). High g individuals can 
lack practical intelligence, and as a result, do unintelligent things.
• 
These three components were not derived by traditional factor 
analysis; they were based on theoretical distinctions, but Sternberg 
has developed tests for all three. Sternberg recognizes that g 
exists. His main argument is that these three components are more 
important than g, and that, unlike g, they can be taught. This, of 
course, is a less limiting view than that of a fixed g and, therefore, 
quite appealing to educators. 
• 
Sternberg has actually instituted educational innovations in some 
school settings based on his model. He and his colleagues have 
published a series of research papers testing his central ideas in a 
broad range of studies—some with generally positive results. It’s 
an extremely ambitious and impressive program of innovation 
and testing. 
• 
The problem is that some independent analyses find that any 
predictive value the Sternberg tests have, can, in fact, can be 
explained more simply by g. Like many issues in psychology, 
the bottom line is not yet clear as to whether the Sternberg model 
improves on or expands the basic g concept. It’s also important to 
keep in mind that Sternberg’s model is relatively new compared to 
over 100 years of research on g, so we’ll await more data. 
Lecture 4: To g or Not to g—Is That the Question?

29
Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences
• 
For Howard Gardner, the g-factor is unnecessary. Gardner proposed 
a model of independent multiple intelligences. The following are the 
basic intelligences, although the list has changed from time to time.
○
○
Linguistic intelligence: reading, writing, and all language skills.
○
○
Logico-mathematical intelligence: solving math problems and 
logical reasoning.
○
○
Spatial intelligence: getting places; packing a suitcase.
○
○
Musical intelligence: includes singing, composing, and playing 
an instrument.
○
○
Bodily/kinesthetic intelligence: dancing and athletics.
○
○
Interpersonal intelligence: understanding other people.
○
○
Intrapersonal intelligence: understanding oneself.
○
○
Naturalist intelligence: understanding patterns in the natural world.

• 
Even though the idea of multiple intelligences is similar to 
Thurstone’s model of primary mental abilities, the basis of 
Gardner’s model is not empirical—there are no factor analyses or 
any other quantitative approach. 
• 
Gardner has not developed any tests of these intelligences. Other 
researchers have developed tests of the multiple intelligences 
defined by Gardner, and the tests are correlated with each other—
that is, there is a g-factor. 
• 
Despite the fact that there is little empirical research evidence to 
support the concept of independent multiple intelligences, it is 
possibly the most popular model of intelligence outside the research 
world, especially among parents and educators, for three key reasons: 
It appeals to the ideal that everyone has some special ability, it doesn’t 
recognize the limitations implied by g, and it’s based on observations 
and anecdotes easy to understand rather than on complicated statistics. 
Intelligence and Social Context
• 
Richard Nisbett is a prominent advocate for the importance of 
social and cultural approaches to intelligence, and he has written 
on it extensively and clearly. The following is a short summary of 
three key points of Nisbett’s view about intelligence.
○
○
Genes don’t count for much.
○
○
Social context determines IQ—not the other way around.
○
○
Schools and education make a big difference in IQ—not the 
other way around.
• 
Research on social and cultural factors often show influences on 
test scores. The controversy is really about what such influences 
tell us regarding how intelligence develops, and the key question 
is how malleable intelligence may be if social and cultural factors 
are manipulated. Another consideration is whether intelligence 
is malleable if the underlying neurobiology of the brain  
is manipulated.

Lecture 5: Intelligence and Genius over the Life Span
Intelligence and Genius over the Life Span
Lecture 5
I
n this lecture, you will learn about a very select group of individuals 
with test scores in the upper end of the normal distribution and follow 
them from childhood into old age. This lecture will address three classic 
research studies. Each one starts with children and tests their mental abilities 
and life successes at various intervals over decades. These three classic 
studies provide compelling data that a single psychometric test score at an 
early age predicts many aspects of later life, including professional success, 
healthy aging, and even mortality.
The Terman Study
• 
In the 1920s, Lewis Terman at Stanford University initiated a 
straightforward study that began by testing many school children 
with the Standford-Binet test. Children with very high IQs were 
selected and then studied extensively for decades. 
• 
Terman’s study had two goals: to find the traits that characterized 
high-IQ children and to see what kind of adults they would become. 
According to Terman, the common stereotype of intelligent children 
was simply “early ripe, early rot.” This similarly applied to child 
prodigies who were thought to be abnormal, poorly adjusted, prone 
to burnout, and even psychotic. These beliefs can be viewed as a 
kind of social justice theory—meaning that if you’re really great in 
your mental ability, then you should be bad in all other abilities to 
balance things out.
• 
In 1920 to 1921, 1,470 children with IQs between 135 and 196 (top 
one percent) were selected from over 250,000 in California public 
schools; they were retested and interviewed every seven years. 
Their average IQ was about 150, and 80 children had IQs over 
170. These were in the top 0.1 percent. This group became known 
unofficially as the termites.

33
• 
They completed extensive medical tests, physical measurements, 
achievement tests, character and interest tests, and trait ratings, 
and both parents and teachers supplied additional information. A 
control group with average IQ scores was also tested. The results of 
Terman’s study were published over time in five volumes. The data 
was quite extensive, but the following is a summary of key findings 
about the lives of the termites.
○
○
Overall, they completely refute the stereotypes both for 
children and adults. The negative, nerdy attributes were 
basically unfounded; they actually were physically quite 
robust and more physically and emotionally mature than their  
age-mates.
○
○
On average, the termites were happier and better adjusted than 
the controls over the course of the study. 
○
○
Although they had their share of life problems, follow-up 
studies showed considerable achievement with respect to 
publishing books, scientific papers, short stories and poems, 
The study of children’s IQ levels can be controversial if the researcher intervenes 
in the lives of the children.

musical compositions, television and movie scripts, and 
patents—just what you’d expect from a very high-IQ group.
○
○
However, further follow-up indicated that high IQ alone did not 
necessarily predict life success. Motivation was also important, 
and Terman believed that while genes played an important role 
in high IQ, he also believed that exceptional ability required 
exceptional education to maximize a student’s potential. This 
may not sound so radical, but even today there is a debate about 
whether any education resources at all should be allocated to 
the most gifted students to develop their high ability. 
○
○
Terman’s project also demonstrated the predictive validity of 
the IQ score—that is, one IQ score in childhood can identify 
individuals who will excel in later life. 
• 
Like all studies, however, there were some major flaws. Terman 
intervened in the lives of these “subjects” and helped them with 
letters of reference for college and for employment. Strong sex bias 
in education and employment resulted in female termites mostly 
becoming housewives, so good male-female comparisons were not 
possible. Similarly, there is no data about minorities. However, it is 
not likely that these problems invalidate the main findings; overall, 
the level of success and the achievement of these very high-IQ 
individuals stand on their own.
The Scottish Mental Survey
• 
All children born in Scotland in 1921 and in 1936 completed 
intelligence testing at age 11 and were retested in old age. This study 
included virtually all children in the country on a test of general 
intelligence rather than identifying samples of very high scorers. 
The total number of children in the study was about 160,000.
• 
In the 1930s, one of the reasons that the Scottish government 
sponsored this study was a concern that the national IQ level was 
decreasing because less intelligent people were having larger 
Lecture 5: Intelligence and Genius over the Life Span

35
families. Actually, from the original testing, there was a clear trend 
that children from larger families had lower IQ scores.
• 
There are many possible explanations, including that higher-IQ 
parents have fewer children or that very large families were even 
poorer than smaller families, so opportunities for education were 
even less available. The trend itself does not identify the causes.
• 
At the time this study began, there was considerable debate around 
the world about national intelligence and eugenics. This clearly had 
very dark and evil consequences in Germany. It’s one of the reasons 
intelligence testing became a negative topic in academia following 
World War II.
• 
Another reason for using intelligence tests in some countries was 
the desire to open opportunities for better schooling to all social 
classes by using test scores as an objective evaluation. This actually 
happened in the United Kingdom after the war, and this motivation 
was important in the development and use of the SAT in the  
United States.
• 
The Scottish survey was over after the second round of testing in 
1936. It only became a longitudinal follow-up study largely by 
accident. Today, a team of researchers directed by Ian Deary at 
the University of Edinburgh is using this database and follow-up 
evaluations to study the impact of intelligence on aging.
• 
Dr. Deary discovered that IQ scores were fairly stable over time by 
showing that scores at age 11 strongly correlated to scores at age 
80. In addition, individuals with higher intelligence scores at age 11 
lived longer than their classmates with lower scores. 
• 
Why should IQ be related to longevity? There are many possible 
explanations. Before age 11, several factors—both genetic and 
environmental—may influence IQ, and then higher IQ leads to 
healthier environments and behaviors and to a possibly better 
understanding of physician instructions. These, in turn, influence 

36
age at death. Because the United Kingdom has universal healthcare, 
differential rates of insurance coverage do not influence these data.
The Johns Hopkins Study
• 
The Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth at Johns Hopkins 
was another ambitious longitudinal project initiated by Julian 
Stanley in 1971. Dr. Stanley repeated Terman’s approach, but 
instead of IQ scores, he used extremely high SAT math scores 
obtained by junior high school students aged 11 to 13 in special 
testing sessions called talent searches. 
• 
Instead of general intelligence, Stanley focused on a very specific 
mental ability. This project also had two major goals: identify 
precocious students early and foster their special talent. The first 
talent search was in 1972. For that search, junior high school 
students in the Baltimore, Maryland, area had to be nominated by 
their math teachers to participate. In that first search, 396 seventh- 
and eighth-grade students took the SAT-M. 
• 
Among other results of that first talent search, 22 of 396 students 
scored at least 660—higher than the average Hopkins freshman at 
the time. In addition, all of these 22 students were boys; none of the 
173 girls scored over 600. These ratios have improved considerably 
over the years, but at the time, this huge disparity was shocking. 
• 
The early data analyses confirmed Terman’s results with respect 
to stereotype about the 22 boys who scored higher than Hopkins 
freshmen. These mathematically precocious students were more 
physically and emotionally mature than their age-mates. On 
average, they scored more like college students than their age-
mates on personality tests. 
• 
Stanley believed that enriched classes were not as productive as 
actual college classes, so he helped many of these very talented 
students go to college early. Like the termites, many went on to 
have successful and very productive careers. 
Lecture 5: Intelligence and Genius over the Life Span

• 
The original talent searches have evolved dramatically and now 
include many programs for enrichment in addition to early college 
admission, including summer camps that emphasize math and 
science experiences.
• 
There are now detailed follow-up studies of thousands of the 
students who participated in several of the original searches. 
Follow-up results show that many of these mathematically 
precocious children, as determined by a single test score when 
they were in their early teens, became very successful in terms of 
occupational and life success.
• 
The longitudinal study of the original talent-search participants 
is continuing with a 50-year follow-up planned by researchers 
Camilla Benbow and David Lubinski at Vanderbilt University. 
• 
Today, talent searches and enrichment programs are still going on in 
many states modeled after Dr. Stanley’s program and the ones later 
sponsored by the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth. Over 
three million students have been tested, and hundreds of thousands 
have participated in special academic programs. In fact, this kind of 
search is now global, with the widespread recognition that finding 
and nurturing this kind of precocious mental ability is good for the 
students—and good for society.

Early Childhood Experience and Intelligence
Lecture 6
I
n this lecture, you will learn how genes and environment influence each 
other by examining research on early childhood education and on other 
environmental factors, including prenatal effects, family factors, diet, 
and poison. There is still no strong evidence that tells us that intelligence can 
be increased by manipulating the early education environment—although 
things like lead poisoning might decrease intelligence. However, any 
environmental effect on intelligence, even ones due to education, must work 
through biological mechanisms to affect the brain. The same is true for all 
genetic effects because genes express themselves through biology. 
Compensatory Education in the 1960s
• 
In the 1960s, when the war on poverty was declared during the 
Johnson administration, early childhood education was seen as 
key to overcoming the educational disadvantages of poverty. 
Children from poor communities often did not have preschool 
home situations that encouraged reading, counting, and other 
basics of learning to prepare for kindergarten. Moreover, the school 
systems in poor neighborhoods typically lacked basic educational 
resources, including outdated textbooks, limited libraries, and  
overburdened teachers.
• 
Partly a response to the civil rights movement and part of the war 
on poverty, compensatory education programs were initiated by 
the federal government. A key goal was to minimize or eliminate 
any effects of poverty on cognitive development as assessed by 
performance on achievement and intelligence tests. The main 
assumption, especially by educators and psychologists, was 
that poverty factors were responsible for most, if not all, of any 
cognitive disadvantages or gaps among racial or economic groups.
• 
In 1969, an educational psychologist from the University of 
California, Berkeley, named Arthur Jensen wrote a detailed article 

40
that evaluated this assumption. The article was published in the 
Harvard Educational Review and was titled “How much can we 
boost IQ and scholastic achievement?”
• 
The article began with a now-famous sentence: “Compensatory 
education has been tried, and it apparently has failed.” This article 
is possibly the most infamous and controversial article in the 
history of psychology, and it has had a profound effect on virtually 
all intelligence research to this day. 
• 
In his article, Jensen came to the controversial conclusion that IQ 
and achievement were not increased by early childhood education. 
With regard to compensatory education, the following three key 
points can be garnered from the article. 
○
○
Achievement and intelligence are not the same thing (even 
though tests of both are highly correlated to each other).
○
○
Compensatory 
education 
can 
influence 
factors 
of 
achievement—including motivation, self-confidence, and study 
habits—but there was scant evidence that it boosts intelligence. 
Any early gains disappeared after a few months or years.
○
○
Genes affected intelligence more than achievement, and this 
was why compensatory education had such little effect.
• 
Whereas today there is powerful scientific evidence and wide 
public acceptance of the idea that genes affect behavior, mental 
illness, and things like personality and intelligence, this was not 
the case in the late 1960s. In those days, anything genetic was 
regarded as deterministic and unchangeable. Today, we know that 
gene expression is dependent on many factors, and that’s where 
epigenetics comes in—your genes are not your destiny. 
• 
When Jensen expressed the view that intelligence was not amenable 
to change because improved education did not seem to have a 
measureable effect, he struck at the heart of conventional wisdom 
Lecture 6: Early Childhood Experience and Intelligence

41
and at the political goal of leveling the educational playing field. 
The following are four main criticisms of Jensen’s views.
○
○
He overemphasized the role of genes given the evidence at  
that time.
○
○
He underestimated the potential of compensatory education: 
Even if the early studies failed—and even Jensen’s critics 
acknowledge that the early results were not impressive—
more intense compensatory efforts would be necessary, so it 
was too early to conclude that compensatory education could  
never work.
○
○
He overstated the evidence that intelligence was stable over the 
life span.
○
○
He undermined hope for eliminating the “achievement gap” 
between white students and minority students.
• 
Was Jensen wrong in concluding that compensatory education did 
not increase intelligence, as was hoped? Although there is good 
evidence that intelligence is fairly stable over a person’s lifetime, 
new data challenges this view, and genes clearly play a powerful 
role in intelligence. Jensen was correct about these points.
• 
More recent efforts to increase achievement with compensatory 
education have been somewhat more successful than the early 
studies Jensen reviewed, but there is still no strong evidence of 
large, lasting gains for intelligence due to educational interventions. 
Surprisingly, the education achievement gap between white 
students and other students also remains about the same over the 
last 40 years, as Jensen predicted.
Early Childhood Education in the 21st Century
• 
Literature reviews in 1988 and 2010 looked at recent studies that 
attempted to raise intelligence with early education programs for 
at-risk children. The three basic findings are as follows. (In sum, 

42
40 years of new data haven’t really changed the results about 
improving IQ.)
○
○
The programs varied in their intensity.
○
○
Any IQ gains tended to fade over time.
○
○
More intense and expensive programs had better results that 
lasted longer, but intelligence gains were still quite small.
• 
The most intensive early education program completed to date is 
called the Abecedarian project, and its lead investigator is Craig 
Ramey. This was quite an ambitious and expensive project. It 
started as educational intervention in the first months of life and 
continued evaluation until young adulthood. There were important 
results for intelligence and for future achievement. 
• 
IQ scores decreased over time for both the early education group 
and the control group, but the early education group maintained a 
five-point advantage over time. The intervention started before age 
five, so it’s not clear whether the five-point advantage at age five 
resulted from the intervention or whether the two groups did not 
start out with equivalent mean scores.
• 
It’s also odd that decreases occurred over time, but there are two 
main considerations: IQ tests for five year olds are not as reliable 
as those for older children and young adults, and brain maturation 
related to intelligence may not begin until later in childhood.
• 
Regardless, the data do not make a compelling argument that this 
early, intense educational intervention in disadvantaged children did 
much for improving IQ. However, results for future achievement 
were better. The early education group showed some lasting 
improvements for a number of behaviors, including better study 
skills and better social interactions, fewer behavioral problems, and 
increased entry to college.
Lecture 6: Early Childhood Experience and Intelligence

43
• 
The general conclusion after more than 40 years of research is that 
there still is no strong evidence of large, lasting improvements in 
intelligence, as measured by tests, due to early education for at-
risk children, but there are other benefits related to achievement. 
Jensen’s conclusions were consistent with these results.
Intelligence and the Physical Environment
• 
Physical environmental factors that may affect intelligence include 
prenatal and infant health, diet, toxins, the home environment, 
socioeconomic status, culture, family size, and birth order. There 
are three general problems that you should keep in mind when 
discussing research on whether these factors influence IQ.
• 
How do researchers design studies comparing effects of two 
environments when we have no comprehensive measure of 
environmental similarity? Environments are really quite complex 
and have many possible factors that change over time. 
• 
People are not randomly assigned to environments. To some degree, 
people select their environments. Even children decide to play with 
other children they like, or they may even prefer to play alone. This 
self-selection may be partly genetic. Personality traits like shyness 
or extroversion may have a genetic component; this complicates 
identifying “environmental” factors. 
• 
Few environmental factors are independent of other factors. 
Socioeconomic status, for example, is related to lower income, 
poorer nutrition, and fewer educational opportunities, and it is also 
related to genetics because people tend to marry within their own 
social class. These related interactions are quite difficult to control 
in experiments.
• 
Toxin exposure in early life can affect brain development; fetal 
alcohol syndrome, pesticides, and lead poisoning all show definite 
relationships with lower IQ scores to varying degrees.

44
• 
Some studies show about a three-point IQ difference in favor of 
children who were breast-fed, and a study published in 2012 
claimed to show that children who ate the most junk food at three 
years of age had lower IQs at age 8.5. Chronic malnutrition may 
affect attention/memory but can be reversed when diet normalizes. 
Overall, it’s actually difficult to prove that general nutrition affects 
IQ very much. 
• 
In general, the better the home environment, the better children 
do on tests, but the effects are small and do not last beyond early 
childhood. These studies tend to be confounded with parents’ IQs 
(for example, number of books in the home). Interestingly, the 
number of words spoken at home is related to language and may be 
related to verbal IQ.
• 
In terms of birth order, in two-child families, there is no apparent 
IQ difference between the first- and second-born child. There is 
also no birth order difference in IQ in three-child families. The data 
Children who are raised in environments that do not support their learning 
might prove to be intellectually disadvantaged.

Lecture 6: Early Childhood Experience and Intelligence

45
for four-child families seems to be more variable, but none of the 
differences are statistically significant. Although birth order has no 
appreciable effect, the average child’s IQ for one-child families is 
higher than for larger families.
• 
In terms of family size, mothers with more children have lower IQs 
than mothers with fewer children. On average, mothers with more 
children are in the 24th percentile whereas mothers with only one 
child are in the 44th percentile.
• 
What we conclude from data like these on family size or from birth 
order isn’t clear. These examples actually show how difficult it is 
to identify the interplay between intelligence and environmental 
factors, even when we have clearly defined variables like family 
size and birth order.

Genes and Intelligence
Lecture 7
C
onsistent evidence for major genetic influences on intelligence 
differences comes from around the world and is based largely on 
powerful twin and adoption research designs. In this lecture, you will 
learn about twin data, adoption data, the search for specific genes, and gene-
environment interactions in the context of the emerging field of epigenetics. 
In addition to being introduced to some historical data, you will be exposed 
to some of the newest data about brain genes and intelligence.
Twin and Adoption Studies
• 
Even before we had the first concept of genes—thanks to Gregor 
Mendel and his peas—it was easily observed that many traits, 
including intelligence, seemed to run in families. Early researchers 
used two simple strategies to determine whether any trait had a 
genetic component or not. They looked at twins and at adoptees.
• 
Because monozygotic twins—that is, identical twins—have 100 
percent of their genes in common, any trait that was found in both 
twins was thought to have a genetic component. The more similar 
the twin pair, the stronger the effect of genes.
• 
Of course, identical twins also share both the prenatal and the 
postnatal environment, so the fact that identical twins may have 
quite similar intelligence test scores did not rule out the notion that 
the similarity was due to having similar environments.
• 
This problem was easily addressed by comparing the similarity of a 
trait between pairs of identical twins, who have 100 percent of their 
genes in common, to pairs of fraternal twins—that is, dizygotic 
twins—who share only 50 percent of their genes. Any similarities 
should not be as strong in the fraternal twins as they are in the 
identical twins, and many twin studies show this.

48
• 
Adoption studies can separate genetic and environmental 
influence, but often biological and adoptive environments are 
similar. Nonetheless, adoption research designs can be powerful in 
establishing whether genes are involved in a trait or not.
• 
There are a number of adoption studies of intelligence. They 
vary considerably regarding the ages at which tests are given and 
the exact tests and sample sizes used, but they typically show 
much higher correlations between the adopted child’s IQ and the 
biological parent’s IQ than between the IQ of the adopted child 
and the IQ of the adoptive parents. This is consistent with a genetic 
component to intelligence.
• 
An even more powerful design combines adoption and twins. It 
involves studying identical twins who were adopted from their 
biological parents in early life and raised separately in different 
families—often, one twin does not even know of the existence of 
the other.
• 
The first major studies of intelligence in identical twins reared apart 
were done in the early 20th century in Britain by Sir Cyril Burt, 
who gave intelligence tests to pairs of identical twins who had been 
reared apart. He correlated the scores for each pair and found a 
correlation in the identical twins reared apart of 0.771, suggesting 
a strong genetic component to intelligence. This correlation was 
nearly as high as the correlation for identical twins reared together 
in the same household.
• 
Subsequent twin studies done by different investigators around 
the world with large samples arrive at an average value for the 
correlation of intelligence scores among identical twins raised 
apart of 0.75. The average value for identical twins raised together 
is about 0.86. These values compare to the fraternal twin data that 
show average correlations for intelligence of about 0.60. 
• 
Compelling data from independent researchers are completely 
consistent with Burt’s analyses and his basic conclusion that genes 
Lecture 7: Genes and Intelligence

49
play an important role in intelligence. Today, there are very few 
critics left who completely dispute that genes play any role at all in 
intelligence, but there are some.
• 
The most famous modern study of intelligence in twins comes 
from the Minnesota study of monozygotic twins that were reared 
apart. Researchers at the University of Minnesota, led by Thomas 
Bouchard, found 139 identical twin pairs that were reared apart. 
This took 21 years (from 1979 to 2000) and included twins from 
around the world.
• 
All of the twins completed an elaborate battery of tests at the 
University of Minnesota for about 50 hours over a week. This 
included tests of intelligence, personality, attitudes, values, and 
many physical characteristics. 
• 
Genetic components were found for several personality traits, like 
extroversion, and even for some attitudes and values. Some twins 
who had had no contact with each other until they were reunited 
in Minnesota had married women with the same names, drank the 
same beer, and even used the same brand of toothpaste. Identical 
twins reared apart in this study were quite similar on many things, 
especially on intelligence scores.
• 
In the Minnesota study, heritability for g was estimated at 0.70, or 
70 percent—similar to the worldwide average of 0.75. Often, you 
may hear that research like this shows a 50-50 spilt between genes 
and environment. There is variability among studies, and there’s an 
interesting factor that accounts for much of this variability: the age 
when twins are tested. In fact, the genetic influence on intelligence 
increases with age. 
• 
There is data that indicates that the heritability of intelligence is 
stronger in families with high socioeconomic status and weaker 
in families with low socioeconomic status. This is an important 
observation that underscores the difficulties in assessing gene-
environment interactions.

50
Shared and Nonshared Factos
• 
A shared environment is what it sounds like: Twins or siblings grow 
up in the same family, live in the same neighborhood, and go to 
the same schools; there are many shared general experiences that 
may influence intelligence. However, of course, there are also many 
experiences unique to each person, including different friends, 
different classes, and different teachers. These unique influences 
are the nonshared environment. 
• 
Shared 
and 
nonshared 
environmental 
influences 
can 
be 
distinguished and estimated statistically by comparing similarities 
among intelligence scores for identical twins, fraternal twins, and 
siblings—reared together and reared apart.
• 
Research shows that the influence of both shared and nonshared 
environments are fairly stable with a trend to decease with age, 
but the influence of shared environment decreases to about zero 
in adulthood. These findings are difficult to explain if you are 
convinced that genes are unimportant influences on intelligence. 
They also give pause to the idea that enriching childhood family 
experiences have a lasting effect on adult intelligence.
• 
Statistically, genetic, shared, and nonshared effects on intelligence 
can be estimated and added together to account for 100 percent of 
individual differences in intelligence.
Intelligence Genes and the Brain
• 
Overall, the case for genetic influences on intelligence is 
overwhelming. Because genes always work through biology, one 
implication is that there is a biological basis to intelligence, and this 
brings the study of intelligence into the realm of neuroscience. If 
genes are so important, then where are the intelligence genes? The 
simple answer is that we don’t know—at least not yet. However, 
epigenetics complicates the story. 
• 
Genes turn on and genes turn off throughout the life cycle. What 
controls genes turning on and off? Is this where environmental 
Lecture 7: Genes and Intelligence

51
factors, especially in early childhood, get their influence? The 
search for specific intelligence genes has been underway for some 
time, but without much success. Intelligence genes have been 
missing—that is, until recently.
• 
The newest studies show that intelligence and brain structure 
have genes in common. A very large study—an international 
collaborative effort—combined genetic and brain imaging 
techniques and was reported in 2009. It imaged white matter fibers 
in the brains of twins and determined genetic and environmental 
influences on white matter networks in the brain (communication 
among brain areas is based on white matter fibers). 
• 
This study showed that in each major lobe of the brain—both for 
the right and left hemispheres—genetic influence on white matter 
is quite strong and nonshared environment has some influence, 
especially in the frontal lobe, but shared environment has virtually 
no influence on white matter.
• 
These researchers also correlated the similarity of IQ scores in the 
twins with the white matter. Then, they determined overlap between

where white matter was most influenced by genes and where IQ 
was most correlated to white matter. 
• 
This example of combining DNA analysis, brain imaging, and IQ 
scores shows how far we are advancing beyond the old arguments 
about whether genes are important for intelligence and even 
whether intelligence can be studied scientifically. Genes not only 
play a role in intelligence, but the new data also show common 
genes for intelligence and specific brain features like white matter.
• 
A number of research groups around the world are using advanced 
genetic techniques to identify specific genes for intelligence. This 
includes using DNA sequencing machines to compare high and 
average IQ people to identify genes that are more frequent in the 
high group. Although this is a daunting challenge, it’s not impossible.
• 
DNA sequencers cost about one to two million dollars each. 
Reportedly, a single research institute in China has 128 of them, 
along with supercomputers, and finding intelligence genes is a high 
priority. Reportedly, they have over 4,000 scientists and technicians 
working there.
• 
Intelligence genes may not be missing for long. The more genetics 
is responsible for intelligence, the more likely we will understand 
the underlying neurobiology and the more likely we can find ways 
to improve intelligence.

rain imaging studies helped shift intelligence research away from 
predominately psychometric approaches, and the controversies 
about them, to a more neuroscientific perspective because imaging 
provided a way to determine how psychometric test scores were related to 
measurable brain characteristics. In this lecture, you will learn about positron 
emission tomography (PET) and how it was used to study intelligence over 
nearly two decades. In modern intelligence research, there are other even 
more amazing imaging technologies, and they show the brain in even greater 
detail than PET. 
PET Scans of the Brain
• 
In the early 1970s, brain researchers who studied humans were 
limited to investigating brain function indirectly by looking at 
blood and urine for by-products of neurotransmitter activity. The 
only useful technology was based on measuring the electrical 
activity of the brain using EEG recordings from scalp electrodes. 
Some progress was being made with EEG studies of intelligence, 
but getting beyond the scalp, through the skull, and inside the living 
brain for research was not really practical.
• 
Positron emission tomography (PET) scans show brain function. 
Radioactive glucose accumulates in brain areas working the 
hardest, which show up on the scan. By contrast, a computerized 
axial tomography (CAT) scan shows only brain structure as X-rays 
pass through the head. You can see a beautiful, detailed CAT scan 
of a person’s brain, but you cannot tell from the scan if the person is 
awake or asleep—or even if they are alive or dead. CAT scans show 
structure, but not function. 
• 
A PET scan looks different depending on what the brain is doing. 
If you inject the radioactive glucose while a person is solving 
reasoning problems, for example, you can see the brain areas that 

55
are at work for reasoning, and you can measure just how hard 
those areas are working.
• 
The first PET scanners became available in about 1980, but only 
a few were put into service. The whole operation was extremely 
complex, and the first scan done at a PET facility cost a few million 
dollars. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), now so familiar, was 
not yet available. The first MRI scanners came to research centers 
in about 1995.
• 
In the early 1980s, most of the PET research was on schizophrenia 
and psychiatric disorders. Most research scans were charged at 
about $2,500 each. PET scans for psychological studies were rare.
PET Studies of Intelligence
• 
In 1988, the first PET study of intelligence was published. It found 
brain areas that were more active while problem solving, but—
very surprisingly—more brain activity was associated with worse 
performance. This counterintuitive result suggested that it’s not how 
PET scanners have been used by researchers to study intelligence for decades.

56
hard your brain works that makes you smart; it’s how efficiently 
it works. Based on this result, the researchers proposed the brain 
efficiency hypothesis of intelligence: that higher intelligence 
requires less brainwork.
• 
Since this surprising finding in 1988, many researchers have been 
trying to understand how exactly brain efficiency might relate to 
intelligence. How can learning make the brain more efficient? 
When you learn something—like driving a car, for example—
doesn’t your brain get more efficient so that you now can drive 
and have a conversation at the same time, something that was not 
possible that very first day you were driving back and forth in an 
empty parking lot? 
• 
One of the first PET studies of learning, which took place in the 
early 1990s, involved Tetris, a computer game that is now one of 
the most popular games of all time. In this study, a small number 
of college-aged male volunteers were scanned before and after 50 
days of practice on the original Tetris version.
• 
In Tetris, different shapes appear at the top of the screen and slowly 
fall to the bottom. You can move them right or left, rotate them, 
or drop them immediately by pressing buttons. The object is to 
place each shape so that the shapes together form perfect rows with 
no gaps at the bottom of the screen. When you complete a row, it 
disappears, and all of the shapes above drop down. The better you 
do, the faster the shapes drop, so with practice, the game is faster 
and harder. The game is over when the shapes not in rows stack up 
to the top.
• 
On day zero, the first time any of the students ever played Tetris, 
they completed 10 rows per game on average while the radioactive 
sugar was labeling their brains during the first PET scan. This 
increased to nearly 100 rows per game during their second scan 
after the practice period. At the end of the 50 days of practice, some 
of the games were moving so fast that you could scarcely believe a 
human being could make and execute decisions so quickly.
Lecture 8: Can We See Intelligence in the Brain?

57
• 
After 50 days of practice, the scans showed less brain activity after 
practice even though the game was faster and harder. Therefore, 
the brain learned what areas not to use and became more efficient 
with practice. In addition, the smartest people became the most 
brain efficient after practice. Other subsequent studies have shown 
inconsistent results, so the jury is still out on this point. Many other 
studies, however, have replicated decreased brain activity after 
learning, which is consistent with the brain efficiency hypothesis. 
• 
Efficiency could result from activity within neurons, glial cells, 
synapses, or white matter fibers that transmit signals around the 
brain—or some combination. Neural pruning, which refers to the 
normal course of brain development, might also be a factor. From 
birth to about age five, there is a dramatic increase in the number

of synapses; then, there is a dramatic decrease, which is called  
neural pruning. 
• 
The pruning mechanisms are still not clear. For example, the rate 
of neural pruning may be largely under genetic control, but could 
stimulating brain areas by learning increase pruning and influence 
intelligence? We don’t know.
Male-Female Brain Differences
• 
In 1995, researchers used PET to see if men and women both 
showed equal brain efficiency in the same brain areas while they 
solved mathematical reasoning problems. Male and female college 
students were recruited based on their SAT-M scores at admission, 
and four groups were selected: men with high SAT-M scores, over 
700; women with equally high scores, over 700; men with average 
SAT-M scores, in the 500 range; and women with average scores, in 
the same 500 range. There were 11 students in each group.
• 
Each person completed a PET scan while they solved actual SAT-M 
reasoning problems. Researchers expected to see lower brain 
activity in both the high SAT-M men and the high SAT-M women 
compared to the average groups—consistent with brain efficiency. 
They also expected that the men and women in the high group 
might show efficiency in different brain areas because there are sex 
differences in brain size and structure.
• 
The averaged PET scans in each group don’t look all that different. 
In the men, statistical analysis showed that high math ability 
correlated with greater activity in the temporal lobes, or the side 
parts of the brain, during the problem solving—just the opposite 
of efficiency. In the women, researchers found no statistical 
relationship at all between math ability and activity anywhere in 
the brain. 
• 
How the brains in the high SAT-M women were working during 
solving the same problems as the men is a mystery. In addition, the 
men showed the opposite of what was expected. This finding was 
Lecture 8: Can We See Intelligence in the Brain?

59
one of the first clear indications from imaging data that men and 
women may process information and problem solve with different 
brain networks. 
• 
In this study, the men and women were equally matched on SAT-M 
scores, and they solved the problems during the scan equally well. 
Their brains, however, showed really different patterns of activity. 
• 
The results of this study imply that not all brains work the same 
way. This may seem obvious and even trite, but at the time of the 
study, most cognitive researchers were interested in discovering 
how brains work in general, assuming that all brains basically work 
the same way. A focus on individual differences and the idea that 
not all brains work the same way was not so popular.
• 
Remember that math ability is a specific factor; it’s not g. Brain 
efficiency may be related to g, but for specific abilities like math, 
better performance may require more brain activity. In general, it

is important to realize that no story about the brain is simple, and it 
takes many studies and many years to sort things out.
• 
Around the year 2000, a PET study was conducted on college 
students while they passively watched videos with no problem 
solving required. Researchers correlated brain activity during this 
non-problem-solving condition to IQ scores. The correlations are 
in several areas—none in frontal lobes and most in the back of  
the brain. 
• 
The results of this study indicate that people with higher IQ scores 
seemed to be viewing videos with different brain activity than 
lower-IQ people, especially in the back of the brain, where basic 
information is perceived. This implies that smarter people may 
be more engaged and actively processing the video information 
differently. In other words, the smarter brains were not so passive. 
This is more evidence that not all brains work the same way.

rain imaging involves the measurement of how specific brain 
areas communicate with each other during complex thinking and 
reasoning. Researchers are making comparisons among people 
with different cognitive abilities and, most importantly, testing hypotheses 
about how an intelligent brain works. In this lecture, you will learn about the 
emerging models of brain function and brain structure that may be the keys 
to answering the question of where intelligence is in the brain.
MRI Scans
• 
Protons naturally spin around an axis, and the spinning creates a 
weak magnetic field. Each proton axis has a different random 
orientation. If protons enter a strong magnetic field, they snap into 
the same north-south alignment. 
• 
If a radio wave is pulsed on and off rapidly into the magnetic field, 
the protons snap out of alignment and then back in; this pulsing can 
be done many times per second. As the protons snap in and out of 
alignment, the shifts give off weak energy, and this energy can be 
detected and mapped, showing where the protons are if the magnetic 
field is applied along a gradient of different intensities. This sequence 
of events is called magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI.
• 
Hydrogen protons are abundant in water, and most of the body—
especially the brain—is made of water, so MRI gives beautiful 
images of the body and the brain. MRI scanners look like large 
donut-like devices containing a very powerful magnet. When a 
person lies on the bed and the head or whole body goes into the 
center tube-like area, radio waves are rapidly pulsed into the 
magnetic field, and the protons in the body snap in and out of 
alignment (the person has no sensation of this snapping). The 
shifting energy patterns formed by all of this snapping are detected 
and mathematically turned into a picture.

63
• 
The basic MRI technique is quite versatile: By changing various 
parameters of the scanning sequence—for example, the frequency 
of the radio wave pulses—different kinds of pictures can be made 
that emphasize different brain characteristics.
• 
These images are more detailed than the older CAT scans, and 
whereas CAT scans were made with X-rays, there is no radiation 
exposure at all during MRI. This is why every hospital has MRI 
machines and why many more researchers have access to MRI than 
they had to PET. 
• 
The three kinds of MRI that have been used to study intelligence 
are structural, functional, and diffusion tensor imaging. Structural 
images show gray matter, where neurons work, and the white matter 
fibers that link brain areas and carry information around the brain. 
Gray matter and white matter tissue have different water content, 
so they can be distinguished in these images. Note that structural 
MRI scanners use a three-dimensional imaging technique to scan the brain.

64
images do not contain any functional information, so you cannot 
look at a structural MRI and tell if the person is awake or asleep, 
solving math problems, or even alive or dead.
• 
Like PET scans, functional MRI (fMRI) shows brain activity, but 
it’s based on blood flow. Functional MRI uses scanning parameters 
that image aspects of hemoglobin in red blood cells. A sequence 
of very rapid images is made—thousands per second—that are 
interpreted as showing blood flow in the brain; those areas that are 
most active have greater blood flow. Whereas PET scans show the 
accumulation of brain activity over 32 minutes, fMRI scans show 
activity changes that last a second or two. 
• 
With diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), the MRI sequences are 
optimized to image white matter fibers, and combined with special 
mathematical algorithms, the resulting images show white matter 
tracts in great detail, and the DTI measures assess the integrity of 
the tracts—that is, how well they transmit signals. 
• 
The main method for analyzing MRIs, which can be used on 
structural, functional, or DTI images, is called voxel-based 
morphometry (VBM). There are three basic steps: First, we start

65
with an MRI image. Then, mathematical algorithms determine 
the boundaries of gray and white matter tissue. Finally, values are 
calculated that reflect the amount of gray or white matter tissue in 
each voxel in the whole brain. Because there are millions of voxels 
in the whole brain image, you get a very large data set. You can then 
correlate a test score, for example, to every one of these voxels and 
identify where the correlations are statistically significant.
MRIs and Intelligence
• 
Researchers used VBM to correlate gray and white matter tissue 
to IQ scores in a sample of volunteers. Based on WAIS IQ scores, 
the results for a group of 47 people showed that the largest areas 
of the brain related to IQ are in the frontal lobes, but there are also 
several smaller areas toward the back of the brain that are related to 
IQ. This is further evidence that intelligence does not depend on the 
frontal lobes alone.
• 
Surprisingly, when researchers analyzed the data separately for 
men and women, they found that in men, the largest brain areas 
where more gray matter correlated with higher IQ were in the back, 
especially in a part of the parietal lobe related to visual-spatial 
processing. However, in women, almost all of the areas where gray 
matter correlated to IQ were in the frontal lobe, especially around a 
part of the brain related to language called Broca’s area. 
• 
These results are consistent with the idea that men and women 
may have different brain areas related to g. In other words, not all 
brains work the same. In addition, the gray matter areas related to 
IQ appear to be under genetic control. 
• 
In addition to conducting research based on WAIS IQ scores, 
researchers have also looked at the correlations between gray 
matter volume and scores on the individual subtests of the WAIS. 
The subtests have different g-loadings—that is, some tests 
are more related to the g-factor than other tests. The higher the 
g-loading of a subtest, the more brain areas showed correlations 
with gray matter.

66
The P-FIT Theory of Intelligence
• 
By 2006, there were 37 imaging studies of intelligence from 
different research groups around the world. Despite using 
different imaging methods and different intelligence tests, there 
were consistent findings. The result of a review of these various 
intelligence studies is a model of brain-intelligence relationships 
called the parieto-frontal integration theory (P-FIT) of intelligence.
• 
As a result of this model, areas of the brain were discovered that define 
a general brain network and subnetworks that underlie intelligence. 
Most of the areas are in the frontal and parietal lobes, but there are 
also some in the left hemisphere, some in the right, and some in both 
hemispheres. At least one frontal area is deeper in the brain. 
• 
A major white matter tract of fibers deep in the brain connects the 
frontal and parietal lobes like a superhighway. It’s called the arcuate 
fasciculus, and it seems to be an important tract for intelligence 
because it integrates information flow between frontal and  
parietal areas.
• 
The way information flows around these areas seems to be the 
basis for individual differences in intelligence. Some people 
will have more efficient information flow and score higher on 
intelligence tests, and others will be less efficient and less good at  
problem solving.
• 
The basic idea of this model is that the intelligent brain integrates 
sensory information in back areas, and then the information is 
further integrated to higher-level processing as it flows to frontal 
areas. Some P-FIT areas in the front and back of the brain are 
areas related to memory, attention, and language—suggesting that 
intelligence is built on these fundamental cognitive processes.
• 
The P-FIT also suggests that any one person need not have all of 
these areas engaged to be intelligent; several combinations may 
produce the same level of general intelligence, but with different 
strengths and weaknesses for other cognitive factors.
Lecture 9: What Brain Imaging Reveals about Intelligence

67
• 
Since the review of 37 studies was published in 2007, there are now 
more than 100 imaging studies of intelligence from research groups 
all over the world. Overall, the emerging evidence supports the 
basic P-FIT model. 
MEG Imaging
• 
One of the newest brain imaging technologies that may have even 
greater potential than DTI is called the magnetoencephalogram 
(MEG). MEG data shows brain activity millisecond by millisecond 
as neuron magnetic fields fluctuate. In fact, there are many brain 
areas involved during one second of activity. MEG technology not 
only shows which areas of the brain are activated, but it also shows 
the sequence of areas that become involved as the brain works on 
even a simple decision.
• 
Researchers are analyzing MEG data and relating activation 
patterns to intelligence scores to see if high- and low-IQ individuals 
show the same sequence of activation across brain areas. If they 
do, is the sequence any faster in the high-IQ people? Alternatively, 
high-IQ people may show patterns with shortcuts, engaging fewer 
brain areas than lower-IQ people. 
• 
Researchers are working with MEG imaging in several ways, and this 
seems to be a cutting edge of brain imaging research on intelligence.

Intelligence and the Brains of Children
Lecture 10
I
n this lecture, you will be introduced to some key research about 
intelligence and the brains of children and adolescents. There are three 
basic questions that will be considered in regard to brain development: 
What aspects of brain development are related to intelligence? Are these 
developmental factors essentially the same for everyone? Is there a critical 
period when these factors can be influenced? This lecture will review several 
imaging studies that address these questions.
High versus Normal IQ in Adolescents
• 
In PET scans of male and female college students doing math 
reasoning during imaging, data for the men showed that activation 
in the temporal lobes was correlated to math score. In another 
study, adolescent males selected for high math ability completed 
functional MRI while they solved problems that required three-
dimensional, visual-spatial problem solving. 
• 
The key to these kinds of problems is the ability to mentally rotate 
objects in 3-D space in one’s head. This kind of visual-spatial rotation 
ability is an important intelligence factor that emerges in studies 
based on factor analysis, and it is related to mathematical ability.
• 
When mathematically gifted adolescents were solving these 
problems during functional MRI, their brain activations were 
greater and more extensive than controls with average math 
ability. Like the PET study using the SAT-Math, more activation is 
apparent for the high-ability group, and the increases are somewhat 
consistent with a frontal-parietal network—but not perfectly.
• 
In a study of Korean high school students, all of the students 
completed the Raven’s test of abstract reasoning. All of the students 
also completed functional MRI while they did simple problems 
and again while they did complex problems. The researchers 

70
Lecture 10: Intelligence and the Brains of Children
subtracted the brain activations during the simple problems from 
the activations during the complex problems. The difference in 
activation between the complex and simple problem solving was 
determined for the left and right hemispheres. The areas of the 
brain that were activated are in frontal and parietal areas and are 
consistent with the P-FIT model. 
• 
In this study, half of the students were selected for high scores on the 
Raven’s test, and the other half were selected for average scores. The 
results showed activation in the parietal area for the high-scoring 
students; activation increases are strongly correlated to Raven’s 
score. Individual differences in brain activity in this specific parietal 
area predict individual differences in Raven’s scores. 
• 
This relationship was not found for the frontal lobes, which 
suggests that the frontal parietal network communication related to 
intelligence may be driven by activity more in the parietal areas. 
However, more research is needed in this area.
Brain Development in Children
• 
There is no question that brain development is rapid and complex in 
the first few months and years of a child’s life. Whatever effects the 
early environment or early education may have on intelligence, those 
effects happen in the brain, and brain imaging in children is beginning 
to identify how brain development and intelligence are related.
• 
In a large collaborative study from the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH), researchers scanned a representative sample of over 300 
children and young adults with structural MRI. Each participant 
completed a battery of cognitive tests, including IQ tests. Many 
of the participants have been rescanned and retested on different 
occasions as they age. 
• 
One of the first papers from this study reported a surprising 
relationship between cortical thickness and IQ. In young children, 
there is a negative correlation; in other words, the thinner the 
cortex, the higher the IQ. However, this negative correlation turns 

71
positive in late childhood, where a thicker cortex is associated with 
higher IQ. In fact, the correlations between cortical thickness and 
IQ are even stronger in late childhood than in early adolescence or 
early adulthood. 
• 
The authors of this study suggest that intelligence is related to rate 
of cortical thickening rather than to just amount of gray matter 
tissue, and there may be a period of brain maturation during which 
critical circuits for intelligence develop. This is an intriguing 
finding, but like everything else, it needs replication. 
• 
Another study from 2009 was based on a different NIH sample 
of 216 children between the ages of six and 18. Researchers from 
several medical centers recruited these children from across the 
country to be a representative sample of the U.S. population. The 
children were not patients. They all completed IQ testing and 
structural MRI. Researchers used these data to test whether brain 
areas in the P-FIT model showed correlations between IQ and 
cortical thickness.
• 
There were significant correlations for the whole sample of 216 
children, and all of the correlations were positive—greater thickness 
correlated with higher IQ. Overall, several P-FIT areas showed 
cortical thickness–IQ correlations, especially in the adolescents, 
and to a lesser extent in the younger children. However, correlations 
were also found in brain areas not part of the P-FIT model.
• 
These analyses did not report a relationship between thinner cortex 
and IQ in the youngest children. This kind of inconsistency is not 
uncommon among studies, and that’s why no single study ever 
settles any issue about the brain. Even in children, brain areas 
related to IQ are distributed throughout the brain, and there seems 
to be a developmental sequence for which brain areas are related to 
intelligence as the brain matures. 
• 
In a newer study of 115 children between the ages of six and eight 
from the Netherlands, children completed functional MRI during 

72
a resting state as well as a nonverbal intelligence test. Researchers 
selected a target brain area and then correlated brain activity in that 
area to activity in other brain areas. 
• 
They found that greater connectivity between frontal and parietal 
areas in the right hemisphere correlated to IQ in these young 
children. However, this was not true for the network in the left 
hemisphere. Therefore, the researchers concluded that the P-FIT 
model appears to characterize young children, at least in the right 
hemisphere. There was also some indication that the findings were 
stronger in girls.
• 
A series of important brain imaging studies in children have been 
done by Vincent Schmithorst and his colleagues at the Cincinnati 
Children’s Hospital Medical Center. These studies include 
hundreds of children who are not patients, and several of the studies 
specifically set out to compare boys and girls. 
The brain scans of young children are used to study developmental aspects  
of intelligence.

Lecture 10: Intelligence and the Brains of Children

73
• 
Through these studies, for boys, a greater association was shown 
between intelligence and the functional connectivity linking a 
frontal lobe area important for language—called Broca’s area—to 
auditory processing areas in the back part of the brain, including the 
parietal lobe. 
• 
For girls, a greater association was shown between intelligence and 
the functional connectivity linking parts of the temporal lobe to the 
same areas in the back of the brain. Frontal lobe connectivity was 
not as important for intelligence in the girls. Therefore, the linkage 
between frontal and parietal networks was apparent in the boys, but 
a different network was apparent in the girls.
• 
In a different analysis of more than 100 of the children who 
completed diffusion tensor imaging, the Cincinnati group found 
IQ relationships to white matter tracts that connect frontal and 
parietal areas, including the arcuate fasciculus. Girls had positive 
correlations between IQ and a measure of white matter reliability 
(or integrity), and boys had a negative correlation. 
• 
For now, the meaning of the opposite direction of these relationships 
is a mystery. The Cincinnati studies also indicate that, even in young 
children, male and female brains have different developmental 
sequences for structure and function related to intelligence.
Critical Periods for Brain Development
• 
If critical periods exist for intelligence, then we need to know 
specific factors that are important for optimal brain development. 
One of the most interesting examples of a critical period in human 
development involves language. Research done at the University 
of Washington in Seattle by Patricia Kuhl illustrates what may be 
happening, in part, for intelligence. 
• 
Kuhl has conducted a large series of experiments with infants 
learning language. The following are four of the key findings.
○
○
Hearing a language results in neuron development, especially 
how neurons connect with each other to form networks, and 

74
this development optimizes the brain for perceiving the sounds 
of the language. This happens specifically in the brain’s 
auditory areas.
○
○
These brain changes happen by six months of age.
○
○
If the infant is not exposed to the sounds of a language during 
this time, learning a new language almost always results in a 
distinctive accent.
○
○
Hearing the language from a human produces more brain 
changes than hearing the language from a television.
• 
Hearing a language fosters network connections in the auditory 
cortex in parts of the parietal lobe where some of the Cincinnati 
studies found relationships to intelligence. In addition, several 
P-FIT areas are related to language, and language ability certainly 
is related to the verbal factor of intelligence. Therefore, hearing a 
language in the first months of life may influence later intelligence. 
• 
There is no direct evidence of this, but there is research that suggests 
that just the number of words spoken in the household before age 
two predicts IQ at age three—and the number of words spoken in 
a household varies tremendously. In addition, the number of words 
spoken is confounded with the IQ of the parents, so causality is  
not clear.

Lecture 11: Sex and Intelligence
Sex and Intelligence
Lecture 11
T
his lecture confronts some controversial data regarding intelligence 
differences between men and women. In this lecture, you will be 
introduced to three issues in this area. First, you will learn that there 
are some sex differences in mental abilities, and you will discover what they 
are. Then, this lecture will address whether the sex differences have any 
important implications. Finally, this lecture will cause you to ask whether 
the sex differences in some mental abilities are related to sex differences in 
the brain. 
Gender Differences and Mental Abilities
• 
Until fairly recently, women were actively discouraged from 
pursuing advanced degrees in the STEM fields, which include 
science, technology, engineering, and math. This discrimination 
was partly based on stereotypes about the proper role of women in 
society and partly based on the perception that women didn’t have 
the mental abilities required for these fields. 
• 
The former point is powerful, but at least it’s open to correction 
if a society chooses to challenge stereotypes—but what about the 
second point? If the second point is actually true, and women and 
men differ on mental abilities, what then? It’s really this latter point 
that is the most contentious.
• 
When we look at measures of general intelligence, the data is 
clear: There are no average intelligence differences between men 
and women. Partly, this is due to the fact that in the development 
of the major IQ tests, individual items that differentiated males 
and females were dropped from the test, but there is considerable 
research using other measures of g that did not follow this practice, 
and the results are the same: No difference in average IQ scores 
between males and females. 

77
• 
However, even with the same means, the actual intelligence 
distributions for males and for females are a bit different. In male-
female comparisons, although the overall group mean is the same 
for boys and girls, there are slightly more girls in the middle parts 
of the distribution, and there are slightly more boys at each extreme 
end. In other words, boys are slightly overrepresented in the low-IQ 
end of the curve and also slightly overrepresented at the high end.
• 
What about the more specific intelligence factors other than g? 
There are some specific mental abilities that do show consistent 
average differences. The following is a partial list from research 
complied by Diane Halpern; the list is from the latest 2012 edition 
of her book Sex Differences in Cognitive Abilities.
○
○
Women are better than men on verbal fluency, fine motor tasks, 
and writing. 
○
○
Men are better than women on tasks that require 
transformations in visuospatial working memory, tasks that 
involve moving objects, motor tasks that require aiming, and 
tests of mathematical and scientific reasoning.
Do the Differences Matter?
• 
Mental rotation is a specific mental ability that shows the largest 
average sex differences. Mental rotation is an important intelligence 
factor, especially for mathematical reasoning. The key to mental 
rotation is the ability to mentally rotate objects in 3-D space in 
one’s head.
• 
On average, men outperform women on tests of mental rotation in 53 
countries. It doesn’t seem like there are major cultural differences, 
but there are many factors in studies like these, and the causes of 
these differences are not really clear. However, women outperform 
men, on average, in some specific spatial tests that do not require 
3-D rotation. Overall, most of the average sex differences are small.
• 
The reasons for sex differences are not clear, but do such 
differences have any importance for understanding why women are 

78
underrepresented in STEM careers? If you look at SAT-Math scores 
over a 25-year period, from 1986 to 2010, there is an increase in 
average scores for both groups, but there is also a 40-point gap that 
favors males that has remained fairly constant.
• 
The Hopkins study in 1972 found 13 precocious boys for every 
precocious girl. More recent talent searches based on the SAT now 
find ratios more like three to one. It is likely that the 1972 ratio of 
13 to one was some kind of sampling error. The three-to-one ratio is 
still large, but certainly less shocking.
• 
Even small mean differences in distributions can result in larger 
disparities at the high end. We observe such a disparity now in 
STEM fields, but nothing about the data tells us anything about the 
causes of the differences. 
• 
The controversy is about the right tail of the distribution and 
whether there is an underrepresentation of women at the highest 
end of the distribution for math and science test scores. A right shift 
may be the case for mathematical reasoning and one reason there 
are fewer women in STEM professions, but there is controversy 
about whether the right shift really exists—or whether it is a  
main factor.
• 
There are other factors that may be more important. For example, 
surveys of women who excel at mathematics suggest that there 
is a tendency among these women to prefer careers that are more 
people-oriented than thing-oriented. People-oriented careers 
include medicine, law, and psychology; thing-oriented careers 
include physics, engineering, and STEM in general. 
• 
A right shift may also be an artifact of the tests. Joshua Aronson is 
an expert on cultural influences on testing. He has special expertise 
in a phenomenon called stereotype threat, which basically means 
that if a person believes that he or she is not expected to do well on 
a type of test because of the group he or she belongs to, that person 
Lecture 11: Sex and Intelligence

79
won’t do well on the test. Instead, he or she will perform like the 
stereotype suggests. 
• 
There is considerable research on stereotype threat, but a key 
question is whether it can explain all of any test differences

between groups. Most research shows that it may explain some but 
not nearly all of a difference. 
Gender Differences and the Brain
• 
There is some imaging evidence of brain differences between men 
and women—and between boys and girls—related to intelligence. 
We don’t know the causes of these differences, but new research 
that combines imaging and genetic analyses offers some hope for 
answers. We just don’t have them yet.
• 
There is some new data on the effects of testosterone on brain 
development that may provide clues about why there are some 
cognitive differences between men and women. This data shows 
that men and women do not differ on g, but they do differ on a small 
number of specific mental abilities—especially mental rotation. 
Brain differences may account for this, but we don’t yet have a full 
picture of how any brain differences may develop.
• 
In the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, any discussion or 
research on sex differences, especially for mental abilities, was 
quite controversial. It has become less controversial, and the 
existence of small average differences is widely acknowledged 
by the public. Funding for more research in this area, however,  
is difficult.
• 
There’s a lot of pop psychology about how men and women 
think differently. For example, think about how men and woman 
generally approach shopping. It’s a clear, everyday observation 
that men and woman have completely different thinking  
about shopping. 
• 
We’ve seen some evidence that male and female brains may be 
organized differently from an early age. No matter how these 
differences may occur, think about implications of having different 
brain organizations for each of the following.

Understanding how any sex differences in the brain may influence 
these areas brings the study of sex differences out of the pop 
psychology realm and into neuroscience. The same is true when we 
try to understand whether there are any cognitive ability differences 
between men and women that are related, at least in part, to  
brain differences.
• 
Achievement gaps between men and women have largely 
disappeared in most careers, and the gap is closing in almost all 
areas. In various fields, including engineering, education, and life 
sciences, there has been a dramatic increase in the percentage of 
women. The role of spatial rotation ability is still not completely 
understood, but achievement gaps are clearly closing.
• 
Males and females differ on average for some mental abilities, and 
we are learning more about how male and female brains may work 
differently even when mental test performance is equal. Knowledge 
about such differences may prove useful for understanding 
how brain damage or brain disease may affect men and women 
differently. The good news is that male-female disparities in most 
vocations are decreasing or even eliminated.

Race and Intelligence
Lecture 12
T
he topic of race differences in intelligence is probably the most 
difficult topic in psychology—even compared to issues regarding 
sex differences. In this lecture, you will be introduced to data about 
differences among groups for average SAT scores. Then, you will be 
introduced to similar data for IQ scores. This lecture will also examine the 
issues surrounding how achievement gaps and IQ gaps may be related and 
what may cause them.
 The SAT Gap
• 
The data showing the gap between blacks and whites for both 
math and reading scores is troubling because of the large size 
of the gap and because the gap appears to be constant with no 
appreciable improvement over time. There are occasional reports 
that the gap is closing, but the overall data doesn’t really show 
much if any narrowing of the black-white gap. There is virtually no 
disagreement about the existence of this gap; it is recognized as one 
of the most important problems in education. 
• 
It’s easy to assume that the gaps that exist for the SATs result 
from test bias. This is a primary basis for arguing that SAT scores 
should not be used as a principle factor in college admission, and 
in fact, most colleges and universities limit the role of SAT scores 
in the admissions process. The test bias argument, however, is not 
compelling. SAT scores were designed to predict academic success, 
and they do so equally well for students of all races. 
• 
There are many other possible reasons for the gap that are more 
likely to be causes. These include poor education, poor home 
environment, poor test preparation, and poor motivation. Most 
people believe that factors like these are the main causes of the gap, 
and there have been earnest attempts to rectify these disadvantages 
to varying degrees. 

84
Lecture 12: Race and Intelligence
• 
So far, however, the overall SAT gap remains fairly constant. It may 
be that good, solid programs to overcome many educational or other 
disadvantages so far have been implemented only for a tiny fraction 
of children that need them. There are many very good reasons to 
support such efforts—regardless of whether IQ scores are raised. 
Good schooling is obviously better than bad schooling and does not 
need justification based on whether intelligence test scores change.
• 
Even when there are improvements in elementary or high school, 
students who enter college with lower average SAT scores than 
their classmates have a much lower chance of academic success, 
especially in STEM majors. This is the so-called mismatch issue, 
and it is the subject of much debate.
The IQ Gap
• 
Psychometric tests of intelligence consistently show average 
differences among racial and ethnic groups. On average, Asians 
score higher than whites, whites score higher than Hispanics, 
and Hispanics score higher than blacks. The average black-white 
difference is about 15 points—about one standard deviation on the 
normal curve, essentially the same difference as the SAT gap.
• 
One standard deviation is a large average difference. It means that 
there are more blacks than whites at the low end of the distribution 
and fewer at the high end. However, it is important to remember 
that this is an average difference. It does not mean that all whites 
are smarter than all blacks.
• 
In fact, there is considerable overlap between the distributions. You 
cannot infer from an IQ score whether a person is a member of one 
race or another. This is a key point because the overlap demands 
that each person be treated as an individual and not stereotyped by 
group membership. 
• 
There are some obvious factors that may cause these average 
differences in IQ scores, and they are essentially the same as the 
factors thought to cause the SAT gaps: test bias, poor education, 

85
poor home environment, poor motivation, and poor test-taking 
skills. A common belief is that the differences must be due mostly 
to IQ test bias. The racial gap was used as evidence of test bias, and 
this resulted in a ban on using IQ tests in school.
• 
Test bias has been studied extensively for four decades. The bias 
argument might predict that the general information subtest would 
show the greatest group difference because poor education would 
result in having less information; in fact, however, the general 
information subtest shows hardly any difference.
• 
One of the subtests with the largest group difference is digit span, 
which involves how many digits a person can repeat from memory. 
However, this is even more interesting because the group difference 
is not in the part of the test that involves repeating digits in order; 
the largest difference is in repeating digits backward.
• 
Data collected from public school children by Arthur Jensen in the 
early 1970s show that digit span forward scores for black and white 
children, who were broken down into groups based on a social 
class index, were not much different between blacks and whites. 
However, scores increase for both groups as social economic  
status increases.
• 
Digit span backward is a test that involves repeating a string of 
digits in reverse order after hearing them. For this test, there are 
clear differences that are consistent for each social class category. 
Again, scores increase as the social class index increases. Social 
class is a complex variable, and it is typically confounded with 
parents’ IQ. More intelligent parents receive more education, earn 
more, and provide more resources for their children.
• 
Digit span backward has a high g-loading; digit span forward 
and general information subtests have lower g-loadings. Overall, 
the largest black-white differences tend to be on tests with higher 
g-loadings. Data like these suggest, but don’t prove, that test bias is 

86
not the major factor in group differences. Not all researchers accept 
this interpretation.
• 
Another kind of test bias, however, is supported somewhat by 
studies of stereotype threat. Stereotype threat studies of many 
varieties basically show that blacks score lower when they are told 
that a test measures intelligence. 
• 
Stereotype threat indicates possible anxiety-related bias, but it 
accounts for only a small portion of the one-standard-deviation 
difference, and it’s not clear how to prevent someone from thinking 
that an intelligence test is not really an intelligence test. While these 
studies support a certain kind of possible test bias, most researchers 
doubt that they account for the whole gap.
• 
There are disagreements about the interpretation of much of the 
data regarding the gaps. In 1995, the American Psychological 
Association (APA) had a committee review all of the relevant data, 
55                 70                  85               100               115               130                145

87
and they concluded that the average IQ differences among racial 
groups were not easily explained away by test bias. Environmental 
disadvantages also were obvious possible explanations, but they too 
failed to account fully for the gaps.
• 
Reasoning tests like the SAT are types of intelligence tests, and the 
total SAT score from all sections is an estimate of g, so it’s possible 
that the SAT gap and the IQ test gap may be two sides of the  
same coin. 
• 
If there is a genetic component to intelligence, then there may be a 
genetic component to the intelligence gaps among races. Logically, 
this is not an unreasonable train of thought, but it implies that 
some groups may have a genetic advantage over other groups for 
intelligence. This idea is about as inflammatory as it gets.
The School Achievement Gap
• 
In addition to his controversial conclusion about the apparent failure 
of compensatory education, Arthur Jensen was the person who 
explicitly tied education achievement gaps directly to intelligence 
gaps in his 1969 article. He directly raised the possibility that 
a part of the school achievement gap might be due to the genetic 
component of general intelligence.
• 
Jensen’s view is actually a simple one: Whatever factors cause 
the difference between low and high intelligence in individuals—
whether genetic or environmental or epigenetic interactions—
they are the same factors for all groups. He calls this the default 
hypothesis. Jensen, and virtually all other intelligence researchers, 
support maximizing educational opportunities for all children 
irrespective of race.
• 
In 1969, when Jensen proposed the idea that part of the 
achievement gap may be due to genetic components of intelligence, 
almost everyone was appalled at this suggestion. If we consider 
that whatever the genetic component of intelligence may be, it 
also may be a factor for group differences, then this is especially 

88
controversial if you believe that anything genetic is determined  
and unchangeable. 
• 
However, genetics may not be so deterministic, especially if we can 
identify specific gene-environment interactions. Nevertheless, the 
idea that genes play any role in the average group IQ differences is 
difficult to accept for most people. Many critics have argued against 
this view. In fact, some researchers have argued that the study of 
group differences is inherently racist.
• 
The main reason for more research on these issues is that there is 
a large, serious school achievement gap among groups that most 
people would like to eliminate. To solve the problem, we need to 
understand all aspects of it—even if the data leads in uncomfortable 
directions. Absence of data is also a prejudice.
• 
There are fair criticisms to be made about the hypothesis that the 
IQ gaps may be due in part to genetics. Given all of the various 
viewpoints, the majority of researchers in the field believe that the 
most likely explanations for the race gaps involve several factors, 
including environmental, genetic, and epigenetic. Of course, this is 
so general that it seems a cop-out, but the short, simple truth is that 
we don’t really know with any certainty why these gaps exist. 
• 
This was the conclusion of the APA committee in 1995, and it is 
still true today. The lack of progress is due to the lack of funding for 
research related to these sensitive issues and to the unwillingness of 
most researchers to get involved in these controversies.

Lecture 13

n terms of the g-factor, are people today any more intelligent then 
they were 200 years ago? What about 2,000 years ago? We have data 
for the last 100 years, and it seems like people are getting smarter. In 
fact, intelligence test scores have been rising from generation to generation 
since they were first introduced. This trend is known as the Flynn effect. 
In this lecture, you will learn that while there is broad agreement among 
researchers that this is a real phenomenon, many issues about the effect are 
still unresolved.
The Flynn Effect
• 
Researchers have determined what the average IQ score would 
be for each year when the norms from 1918 are used to calculate 
the scores for all subsequent years. In 1918, the mean was 100, 
but the mean was 125 in 1995 using the old 1918 norms. In other 
words, it looks like people are getting smarter from generation  
to generation.
• 
If 1995 norms are used, the 1995 mean was 100, but the 1918 mean 
IQ for the population would have been 75 if 1995 norms were 
used. In other words, the average IQ in 1918 would have been in 
the mentally retarded range by the 1995 standard. Obviously, most 
people were not mentally retarded in 1918. This illustrates a serious 
problem with IQ scores if norms are not updated periodically. 
However, when the same norms are used, it looks like IQ is 
increasing from decade to decade.
• 
A large number of data sets from around the world going back 
decades show that there is a clear trend of increasing intelligence 
scores. This phenomenon is called the Flynn effect, and it presents a 
challenge to the standard g model. 

91
• 
If intelligence scores are fairly stable over a person’s lifetime, and 
if genetics is so important for intelligence, then how can scores be 
increasing so much over just 100 years? James Flynn, a professor 
of political philosophy in New Zealand, is the person who has 
written most about this—especially in his 2007 book called What 
Is Intelligence?.
• 
Flynn’s story starts in 1984, when he became interested in the 
stability of IQ scores. Over time, Flynn has reviewed IQ data 
from many studies going back to the turn of the 20th century, when 
intelligence testing records began. He found a very clear trend of 
increasing scores. He also discovered that the tests with the highest 
g-loadings were not always the ones that showed the greatest gains. 
The picture is mixed. 
• 
Various data from numerous studies show a Flynn effect even for top 
students, and the effect is apparent for boys and for girls. However, 
the effect is limited mostly to math scores. Clearly, data about the 
Flynn effect raise many questions. There are many, many data sets, 
and now there are many researchers looking at them. Therefore, 
there are disagreements about how to interpret the same data.
• 
The key issue is whether the Flynn effect is mostly for g or non-g 
tests. Many critics of IQ testing and the g concept immediately and 
enthusiastically embraced the idea that IQ scores are increasing 
from generation to generation. 
• 
The Flynn effect is popular among critics of g because critics 
reasoned that such a large increase could not occur so quickly if 
IQ was mostly genetic. Genes are subject to evolution over very 
long periods of time, so three or four generations are far too short 
to see genetic changes. Therefore, for many critics, the Flynn effect 
was proof that environment factors must have considerably more 
influence on intelligence than the genetic data indicated.
• 
However, if the gains are mostly for low g-loaded tests, there can be 
explanations that do not challenge the concept of g or the importance 

92
of genetics. Various research studies show mixed and inconsistent 
findings about whether the Flynn effect is mostly a g effect or not. 
A key issue is whether increased test scores reflect better test-taking 
skills or an actual increase in the g-factor. Disentangling these 
two possibilities in research studies is quite difficult. So far, the 
evidence is not clear one way or the other. The following are some 
other important unresolved issues about the Flynn effect.
○
○
Is the effect greater for people with lower scores?
○
○
Is the effect the same size in different countries?
○
○
Is the effect still operating now as strongly as it did 100  
years ago?
○
○
Will the effect continue in the future? 
• 
All of these issues depend in some way on what may be causing the 
basic Flynn effect. 
Changes in Society and the Flynn Effect
• 
There are many changes in society over the last 100 years that may 
be causing the increase in intelligence test scores, including that

the world has become more industrialized, mass communication 
has spread, nutrition has generally improved, and education has 
increased for more people. Of course, more than one factor can  
be involved.
• 
The common thread among these possibilities is that largely 
because of science and technology, and mass media, people are 
much more experienced with abstract—rather than concrete—
approaches to problem solving. This experience could affect brain 
development in ways that increase intelligence. This general idea is 
certainly reasonable, and it gives rise to many testable hypotheses. 
• 
There is a large body of data, but so far, the data do not present 
a uniformly consistent picture. The bottom line is that we still do 
not know specifically what causes the Flynn effect. If we did, we 
should be able to design ways to use those causal factors to increase 
intelligence even faster or more broadly. 
• 
Nevertheless, Flynn has a number of ideas about these issues. First, 
it’s important to understand that Flynn is not anti-g; he acknowledges 
that the g model explains much data accumulated from thousands 
of studies, and the g model has provided an important framework 
for testing many hypotheses over the years. However, he sees the 
Flynn effect as data that is not easily explained by the g model. 
• 
Flynn regards the g-factor as a snapshot at any given time extracted 
from a battery of mental ability tests, but he argues that the 
individual mental abilities can change independently of g, and they 
depend on social context and trends. Therefore, while a person’s g 
may be stable, the elements that contribute to g may change. In fact, 
some tests show a much larger Flynn effect than other tests.
• 
Flynn offers an alternative model to the g model, which he calls 
BIS: The “B” stands for “brain,” the “I” stands for “individual 
differences,” and the “S” stands for “social trends.” All three work 
together to influence intelligence. 

94
• 
Flynn takes the view that social and cultural factors are the most 
important influences on brain development and on individual 
differences in intelligence. He is less convinced that genes are 
involved in the racial gaps, and he is optimistic that the gaps will 
close as social and cultural disadvantages are minimized. He is 
particularly concerned with poor language skills in early life.
• 
There are many critics of Flynn’s model and his interpretation 
of results, but regardless, Flynn has helped us rethink our ideas 
about intelligence. It is an overreach to argue that the Flynn effect 
disproves a major role for genetics, as some critics do. It’s fair to 
say that many, if not most, researchers take either an explicit or an 
implicit view of intelligence based on epigenetic concepts. 
• 
Whatever the environmental and sociocultural factors of the Flynn 
effect may be, they must act through the neurobiology of the 
brain with whatever the genetic factors may be. In other words, 
genes provide basic brain parameters for intelligence and IQ, and 
the g-factor, but other factors influence how the genetic potential 
unfolds. The Flynn effect indicates that those factors include social 
and cultural factors, but whether these factors influence g is not clear. 
• 
The Flynn effect has caused a constructive reexamination of some 
basic views about intelligence. For the most part, the parameters of 
the Flynn effect are still a puzzle, and the causes are still a mystery. 
Whether the factors that underlie the Flynn effect can be used to 
influence an individual’s intelligence within a single life span 
remains to be seen.
• 
It may also be the case that we will never understand the Flynn 
effect because of the limitations of intelligence tests to measure the 
g-factor in a true quantitative way, like we measure temperature 
or liquids. There are some potential new approaches to measuring 
intelligence that may avoid the problems with current tests.
• 
A new brain imaging study that was conducted in London and 
published in 2011 measured changing IQ scores in the teenage years 
Lecture 13: Are We Really Getting Smarter?

95
and found that while intelligence is fairly stable over a lifetime, 
there are some important caveats—especially in the teenage years. 
Like the Flynn effect, however, the factors that cause fluctuations 
in intelligence are not clear. They could be related to schooling 
or many other concurrent social factors. Of course, there are also 
many biological changes during these years.
• 
If intelligence is less stable than has been believed, we need to 
identify the things that influence change—perhaps better nutrition 
and increasing exposure to television, computer games, and other 
complexities of the modern world. Then, we can investigate the 
biological mechanisms for how they influence the brain.

Lecture 14: The Mind in Milliseconds
The Mind in Milliseconds
Lecture 14
I
n this lecture, you will learn about some alternative ways to think about 
measuring intelligence based on how fast the brain processes information. 
These methods avoid the critical problem of IQ points not being able to 
be measured like temperature degrees or liters of liquid. It turns out that we 
can measure the mind in real units with perceptual tasks. As we learn more 
and more about the brain and how it processes information, we get closer to 
seeing intelligence in neurophysiological terms, and once we understand the 
neurophysiology, we may be able to modify it to enhance intelligence.
Perceptual Tasks
• 
Perceptual tasks will surely appeal to you if you think you’re not a 
good test taker. In a simple perceptual task, you will see a simple 
figure flash on a computer screen very quickly. This figure will flash 
on a computer screen many times; each flash is called a trial. For 
example, the figure might be composed of two lines, one of which 
is shorter than the other. Sometimes, the long side of the figure will 
be on the left, and sometimes the long side will be on the right. 
• 
All you do is press one button if the long side is on the right or 
another button if the long side is on the left. You simply press the 
button of your choice as fast as you can each time the figure flashes.
• 
For each trial, as soon as the figure flashes off, another figure 
appears immediately—with heavy lines of equal length on both 
sides, for example. This figure is called a mask. It always is the 
same, and its purpose is to mask any lingering image of the other 
figure on your retina so that your decision is not influenced by any 
trace of the image after it flashes off. 
• 
Here’s what makes this simple perceptual task a test: The first flash 
lasts a fairly long time—about a full second. It’s very difficult to 
make a mistake about which side is longer when the figure stays 

97
on for a second. But as the trials continue, each flash stays on for 
shorter and shorter amounts of time. 
• 
When the flashes reach about a half of a second, or 500 milliseconds, 
people start making mistakes. The flashes continue to be briefer and 
briefer, until the shortest period the flash stays on is determined 
where the person maintains a criterion like 75 percent accuracy. 
This shortest period of getting the side correct is called inspection 
time, or the briefest time you can perceive which line is longer. 
• 
It turns out that people differ on inspection time: Some people can 
perceive the lengths of the lines with very brief flashes, and other 
people need longer flashes to see the lines. It also is the case that 
inspection time is reliable in that the same person tested on two 
occasions shows the same value. Identical twins also have similar 
inspection times.
• 
Inspection time correlates to IQ scores. People with higher IQ scores 
have faster inspection times. The correlation is about 0.5, which is 
a moderate correlation, 
but it’s not really strong 
enough to be an actual  
intelligence test. 
• 
The point is that a 
simple perceptual task 
is correlated with the 
much more complex IQ 
score. This raises the 
possibility 
that 
other 
tests 
of 
information 
processing may estimate 
intelligence even better. 
Such tests might be 
quick, easy, and cheaper to administer than psychometric tests, 
and inspection time may be less uninfluenced by culture and  
social factors.
Inspection Time

98
• 
Intelligence 
test 
scores 
rank 
people relative to each other; they 
are ordinal measures, so there 
is no actual zero point, and the 
intervals between IQ points are 
not necessarily equal. IQ scores 
are not like pints or liters of liquid. 
However, time in milliseconds is 
a true metric. Each millisecond 
measures the same time interval. 
For example, 100 milliseconds is 
exactly twice 50 milliseconds. In 
addition, zero means zero. Time 
is a ratio scale, and a ratio scale is 
like pints or liters of liquid.
• 
Measures of the time it takes the brain to perceive and process 
information have the potential to be actual measures of intelligence. 
The question is whether such measures are related to intelligence, 
and we see from research on inspection time that they are.
• 
In fact, long before studies of inspection time, there is an extensive 
history of measuring brain processing speed with reaction time. 
There is now a considerable interest in using reaction time as a 
possible alternative to psychometric tests of intelligence.
• 
Reaction time is simply the time it takes between a stimulus and a 
response. For example, a light flashes on, and you press a button as 
quickly as you can. The time between the light coming on and your 
button press is your reaction time.
• 
The scientific study of psychology in the late 19th century actually 
began with studies of reaction time, and to this day, response time 
experiments are mainstays of cognitive psychology. However, it 
was a problem of individual differences in perception and speed of 
processing that really brought attention to response time.
Lecture 14: The Mind in Milliseconds
Inspection Time: Mask

99
• 
There are now about 150 years of reaction-time experiments 
addressing issues about learning, memory, and attention, but most 
of them do not investigate individual differences. Interest in using 
reaction time to measure individual differences as they may relate 
to intelligence has more recent origins. 
• 
Many thousands of children and adults have done many variations 
of tasks used to study response time. Overall, it turns out that the 
correlation between response time for a simple choice is correlated 
to intelligence test scores, but response time to more complex 
choices is more strongly correlated to intelligence test scores. In 
fact, if you add a battery of different response time tests to a battery 
of psychometric tests and do a factor analysis, the response time 
tests load on the g-factor. Movement time does not.
Mental Chronometry
• 
Arthur Jensen, who wrote a paper on compensatory education and 
group differences in IQ, also believed that psychometric intelligence 
tests could never resolve any of the core issues because these tests 
were limited to ranking individuals rather than measuring how 
brains function. 
• 
Jensen was very much aware of brain imaging and its importance 
for intelligence research because it could measure brain structure 
and function in actual units, but he also was interested in developing 
response time measures as a more sophisticated measurement tool. 
He spent much of his later career developing what he called mental 
chronometry. The four basic ideas of mental chronometry are 
as follows.
○
○
Response time is correlated to measures of intelligence.
○
○
Response time is regarded as a measure of information 
processing speed.
○
○
Response time to different basic cognitive tasks can be 
used to assess individual differences in cognitive strengths  
and weaknesses.

100
○
○
Standardized response time measures can substitute for 
intelligence tests.
• 
Jensen not only argued that it is time to focus research away from 
the traditional psychometric intelligence tests, but he also wanted to 
redefine intelligence in terms of information processing and assess 
it with response time tests. He went even further and suggested that 
it was time to replace the word “intelligence” with something more 
like “mental processing.”
• 
One issue with mental chronometry is whether faster response time 
is a cause or a consequence of more intelligence. The bottom-up 
view is that faster brain processing results in higher intelligence. 
The top-down view is that higher intelligence results in faster 
processing. The data does not yet resolve which view is correct, but 
brain researchers generally tend to prefer bottom-up explanations. 
• 
Another basic issue is why something as simple as response time in 
a fairly simple task—even a task that requires choices—is related 
to the far more complex problem solving tapped by psychometric 
tests. Critics of mental chronometry have proposed several 
possible reasons that explain away the basic correlation, but so far, 
none of the proposed alternative explanations have a compelling  
empirical basis.
• 
As of now, there is not yet a standardized response time assessment 
or battery of tests that could be the basis of a new science of mental 
chronometry, but there are researchers working on it.
Executive Function
• 
Although cognitive psychologists have focused their research 
primarily on general principles of learning; memory and attention; 
and basic, elemental cognitive processes like memory and 
attention, there is an important cognitive concept that addresses 
issues relevant to understanding intelligence. It is the concept of  
executive function.
Lecture 14: The Mind in Milliseconds

101
• 
Executive function has an enormous research literature. The 
following is a basic summary.
○
○
Executive function refers to how the brain organizes all of the 
incoming sensory information.
○
○
Memory is a key component.
○
○
Attention is a key component.
○
○
Prioritizing is another component.
○
○
Decision making and taking action are the results of  
executive function.
• 
All of the elemental cognitive processes in executive function 
taken together may be thought of as intelligence—or, at least, as 
a framework for intelligence. This is partly the basis for Jensen’s 
view that it is time to consider standardizing response times to basic 
cognitive processes as a way to understand intelligence.
• 
Interestingly, as more cognitive psychologists become interested 
in intelligence, there are some attempts to train people to perform 
basic cognitive tasks better, thereby increasing IQ.
• 
Another reason to think about tests of brain processing as possible 
measures of intelligence is because we know that perception and 
processing speed depend on some of the same brain areas that are 
related to intelligence. Brain data may someday be used to assess 
intelligence based on sequence and timing differences among 
people. It has some of the same advantages of mental chronometry, 
although it is more expensive and less practical. 
• 
A new science of measuring intelligence is emerging, and these 
measures will not be bound by the limitations of interval scales 
like IQ tests. As in all scientific fields, new and better measures 
advance understanding and allow more sophisticated questions and  
theories to test.

Creativity and Intelligence
Lecture 15
I
n this lecture, you will learn what the research shows about creativity 
and the brain. You will learn about some very rare cases in which brain 
damage or the onset of dementia has apparently unleashed creative 
genius that the person never had before—called acquired savant syndrome. 
This lecture will also address issues about defining and measuring creativity 
for scientific study, which are similar to those regarding intelligence. You 
will also learn about the relationship between creativity and intelligence, 
and you will examine brain imaging studies of creativity and what  
they show.
Acquired Savant Syndrome
• 
Cases of acquired savant syndrome, in which a person acquires a 
profound or prodigious ability after an accident, are exceedingly 
rare. Most of them are anecdotal, and researchers have investigated 
few in any systematic way. They are so rare that it is difficult to 
formulate any conclusions about them. 
• 
There is reasonable skepticism about cases of acquired savant 
abilities, but there are two kinds of cases where artistic creativity 
emerged after specific, well-documented brain damage. Both kinds 
are extremely rare—even rarer than savants. One kind of acquired 
savant case involves strokes or brain aneurisms; the other kind 
involves a type of dementia called frontal temporal dementia.
• 
In 1988, a man named Jon Sarkin had a stroke when he was 35 years 
old. The left hemisphere of his brain was severely damaged, and to 
make matters worse, he developed life-threatening complications 
that caused surgeons to remove part of his left cerebellum. When 
he recovered, Jon began to create art and demonstrated a talent he 
apparently never had before.

104
Lecture 15: Creativity and Intelligence
• 
To complicate the story even more, Jon’s artistic drive is obsessive 
and compulsive. Furthermore, Jon also developed bipolar disorder; 
his moods swing from mania to depression. Jon’s intelligence, 
however, appears unaffected.
• 
Jon has undergone sophisticated brain imaging at Harvard, 
including diffusion tensor imaging. The conclusion was that Jon’s 
brain had developed new connections from the remaining parts of 
the cerebellum to parts of the brain that were not usually connected 
to the cerebellum. How this happened is unknown, but it is an 
important hint about artistic creativity and brain connectivity.
• 
The second kind of brain damage that is associated with artistic 
creativity is a type of dementia called frontal temporal dementia. 
This is not Alzheimer’s disease, but it is equally devastating—
although not as common. In a few rare cases of frontal temporal 
dementia, the patient develops a completely new desire and ability 
to create art or music.
• 
There are some scientific papers published about creativity 
emerging in patients with frontal temporal dementia that include 
brain imaging. The general conclusion is that the subgroup of 
patients who have more deterioration in the left temporal lobe as 
the dementia progresses are the ones who are more likely to show 
new artistic or musical talent. 
• 
The general idea is that temporal lobe deterioration disconnects 
pathways to the frontal lobes, and the frontal lobes become 
disinhibited. When your neurons are excited, they fire a pulse of 
information to other neurons. Inhibition stops excitation. The brain 
is constantly ebbing and flowing between excitation and inhibition. 
Disinhibition weakens inhibition and results in more excitation.
• 
Disinhibition of the frontal lobes also occurs with alcohol 
consumption and some drug use. It may be why LSD makes some 
people feel creative. Drugs that are used to induce anesthesia often 
create a stage of disinhibition just before loss of consciousness, 

105
when patients say all kinds of things. Dreaming may also be 
associated with disinhibition of frontal lobes.
Defining and Measuring Creativity for Scientific Study
• 
Even though savants are very rare, artistic ability is not unusual 
among savants. Creativity and artistic ability are not necessarily the 
same thing. Is the scientific study of creativity possible?
• 
On one hand, most research strongly supports the concept of a 
general factor of intelligence that is common to all mental abilities; 
on the other hand, savants demonstrate that individual mental 
abilities can exist independently of the general factor. Is creativity 
more like an independent general factor, common to various fields, 
or is it more like a specific mental ability? Are there different 
creativities, such as music, art, and science? 
After a major event, such as a stroke or accident, some people develop artistic 
or other abilities that they didn’t have before the event.

• 
We generally recognize intelligence when we see it, and we 
certainly easily recognize the lack of it, but is the same true for 
creativity? How is creativity different from intelligence?
• 
One widely accepted concept is that creativity typically involves 
the production of something novel and useful or valuable. However, 
usefulness is difficult to apply to art, for example, although art can 
be valuable both in terms of emotional enjoyment and in terms 
of money. Usefulness and value, of course, depend on the social 
context, which is always changing.
• 
The threshold theory basically says that an IQ above 120 is 
necessary for creativity. Over 120, some theorize that additional 
IQ doesn’t increase creativity whereas others think the that most 
creativity is likely in the very highest IQ range. Data from follow-
up studies of the Hopkins Study of Mathematically Precocious 
Youth support the idea that highest scores predict more creativity 
defined in terms of objective accomplishments, even at the very 
highest end of the distribution.
• 
The remote associates test is one of the tests that researchers 
use to measure creativity. This test assesses the ability to see 
unusual associations and connections between common things. 
Because the associations required are unusual, they are called  
remote associations.
• 
The following is a sample test item: What new word is associated 
with the words “cottage,” “Swiss,” and “cake”? The answer is 
cheese: cottage cheese, Swiss cheese, and cheesecake. There are 
wide individual differences among people on this test. 
• 
This test requires basic knowledge that may or may not be current, 
but in addition to good vocabulary—which is correlated with IQ—
you also need to be able to associate things that may not be obvious. 
Researchers think of this as at least one component of creativity. 
Lecture 15: Creativity and Intelligence

107
• 
Another test is called the uses of objects test. Researchers use this 
test as a measure of divergent thinking—that is, what is often meant 
when you “think out of the box.” This test also taps the fluency of 
unusual ideas, which is another aspect of the creative process. 
• 
The uses of objects test gives a person 60 seconds to list novel and 
creative uses of a common object—such as a brick, for example. 
The following are some ideas for using a brick: doorstop, water 
saver in a toilet tank, paperweight, bug smasher, and exercise 
weight. The actual test includes other items in addition to a brick, 
and a person’s responses are rated for creativity using standardized 
criteria. This test has also been used with brain imaging.
• 
A third test asks a person to think of creative captions for ambiguous 
pictures, which is actually quite difficult. These tests require ratings 
and some consensus about what is creative. This is really not as 
objective as most scores on intelligence tests—and certainly not 
like measuring temperature or liquids.
Creativity and the Brain
• 
There are many popular books about creativity and how to increase 
it or unleash it, but there does not seem to be compelling research 
that supports any measurable increase in creativity due to brain 
exercises. There is also a popular idea about creativity that focuses 
on a distinction between the right brain and the left brain. The 
general idea is that creativity comes from the right hemisphere and 
that rationality is a function of the left hemisphere. This idea is very 
general, and it is based mostly on patients with brain damage.
• 
As we know from functional brain imaging studies of intelligence, 
information flows throughout the entire brain. One hemisphere may 
be more involved than the other for any particular problem solving, 
but whether creativity depends more on the right hemisphere is still 
an open question that can be tested with brain imaging. 
• 
Brain imaging studies of creativity are just getting started, probably 
because the tests and measures of creativity are not as well 

108
developed as intelligence tests and measures. Whereas the g-factor 
has proved to be a useful framework for intelligence studies, there is 
not yet a comparable empirical finding for creativity. Even defining 
creativity is more difficult than defining intelligence.
• 
One of the first brain imaging studies of creativity measured the 
thickness of the cortex at many points throughout the brain and 
then correlated thickness to scores on a creativity index. This 
study found that gray matter in the cortex is related to a creativity 
index, suggesting that neuroscience investigations of creativity are 
possible. This is only one early study, and the results should not be 
overinterpreted, but there is additional evidence that brain structure 
is related to creativity.
• 
There are a number of functional imaging studies that have used 
various measures related to one or another aspect of creativity. The 
field is somewhat like the imaging studies of intelligence several 
years ago, when researchers extracted some common findings 
across disparate studies to formulate the P-FIT model.

Can Intelligence Be Enhanced?
Lecture 16
W
hether intelligence can be enhanced for anyone is really one of 
the greatest questions that exists in the field of neuroscience. 
It’s at the heart of all intelligence research—either directly or 
indirectly. This lecture will introduce you to some promising approaches 
to this question. Specifically, you will learn about genetic and nongenetic 
approaches that are being researched with the aim of increasing intelligence 
or learning ability, mostly in adults. 
Genetics and Brain Imaging
• 
Many countries are doing genetic research, and some research 
groups are combining genetics and brain imaging. One example 
is a large consortium of research groups from around the world 
working together to find gene-brain relationships that underlie 
mental illnesses and brain diseases. They are also looking  
at intelligence.
• 
This consortium is called ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging 
Genetics through Meta-Analysis). They have pooled their databases 
and standardized their protocols. They now have over 21,000 
individuals who have completed brain imaging with at least 
structural MRI and who also have contributed DNA samples. A 
subgroup has completed intelligence testing. Paul Thompson at 
UCLA is one of the principal investigators.
• 
One of the findings reported in 2012 was the identification of a gene 
that was related to brain size and to intelligence. The gene is called 
HMGA2, one of the first genes found in humans to be associated 
with higher intelligence test scores.
• 
They also reported another gene related to the size of the 
hippocampus, an important part of the brain related to memory. 
It, too, showed a relationship to intelligence scores—and the 

111
relationship for both genes appeared to be stronger for nonverbal 
intelligence. These genes were found in samples from around  
the world.
• 
The ENIGMA findings are dramatic because of the size and 
scope of the database and because they were able to replicate 
these intelligence findings in independent samples. The actual 
associations between the genes and intelligence, however, were 
not all that strong. Most researchers now believe that there will be 
many genes like these identified, and each will contribute a small 
amount to intelligence. Whether these particular genes are sensitive 
to epigenetic influences is not yet known.
• 
We are at the beginning of tying specific genes to intelligence and 
learning how those genes function. This is the basis for eventual 
capabilities to influence the genetic mechanisms of intelligence, and 
it is why it seems like it will be possible to enhance intelligence, 
possibly dramatically, at some point in the future when we have an 
understanding of how the mechanisms work.
• 
This is the same sequence of scientific discovery that is the basis for 
finding genes related to specific diseases, learning how those genes 
work through biological mechanisms, and then finding ways to 
influence the biological mechanisms to prevent or treat the disease. 
Those ways could be by drugs or by lifestyle changes.
Nongenetic Approaches to Enhancing Intelligence: Memory Training
• 
There are approaches that are not based on genetic mechanisms that 
are being tested to enhance intelligence. One of these nongenetic 
approaches is based on memory training, and another is based on 
shocking the brain with electricity.
• 
In 2008, a group of cognitive psychologists at the University of 
Michigan were studying aspects of memory. They became interested 
in whether memory training improved general cognition—and 
possibly intelligence. There had been some suggestion in earlier 
studies that this might be the case.

112
• 
These psychologists studied 70 university students (males and 
females). Half were assigned to a memory-training group, and half 
were controls with no training. Training lasted eight to 19 days.
• 
All of the students completed intelligence testing with test items like 
the ones on the Raven’s matrices test—which symbol completes the 
pattern in the matrix—with a 10-minute time limit. Each student 
took the tests before and after the training period or, for the controls, 
before and after the same number of days had passed. 
• 
The question was whether the group who received the memory 
training had higher test scores after the training compared to 
the controls, who received no training. Higher scores would be 
calculated by subtracting the pre-training score from the post-
training score, and then comparing the change to any change in the 
control group.

113
• 
The key question in this study is whether the intelligence test scores 
increased following this short-term-memory training. In other 
words, did improvement in short-term memory generalize to an 
increase in general intelligence?
• 
Intelligence test scores for pre- and post-training showed an average 
increase for the training group. There was a smaller increase for 
the control group after the same period of time. The more days of 
training, the greater the increase in intelligence score.
• 
The authors of this study concluded that short-term-memory 
training could enhance the kind of intelligence associated with 
reasoning and problem solving—key aspects of the g-factor.
• 
Critics of IQ and intelligence research jumped on these results as 
evidence that IQ was not fixed and could be enhanced with cognitive 
training. Many critics took the view that this demonstration of 
malleable intelligence undermined the genetic arguments, just like 
the Flynn effect did. The reasoning went that if simple cognitive 
training could increase IQ so dramatically, then underperforming 
school children could be trained to have higher IQs, and this would 
eliminate the achievement gap.
• 
However, there were some possible flaws in this study. For 
example, males and females were combined, so any sex effects 
were not investigated. More importantly, the Raven’s matrices 
items require some short-term memory during the problem solving. 
The better your short-term memory, the more items you can finish 
in the allotted time. Therefore, training short-term memory is not 
completely independent of the test used to measure the outcome. 
Moreover, if intelligence is increased, the g-factor should be 
increased. To really assess g, however, a battery of tests needs to be 
given rather than a single test.
• 
The most critical problem with the interpretation that intelligence 
increased after training is that intelligence test scores are only 
interval scales. IQ points are not measurements like degrees of 

114
temperature or liters of liquid, so the meaning of an increase in test 
scores alone is not clearly an increase in intelligence.
• 
Two of the principal authors of the 2008 University of Michigan 
study are cognitive psychologists Susann Jaeggi and Martin 
Bushkuel. They have subsequently published several studies 
replicating the findings and extending the same training effects 
even when a simpler memory test is used, and they have shown 
similar effects in children using child-friendly versions of the 
memory test.
• 
Overall, these studies argue that the training improves performance 
on tests that were not part of the training. In other words, the 
training improvements of short-term memory generalize to other 
test scores. However, the issue of whether intelligence increases 
is still open. It may not be possible to do a compelling study 
with current intelligence tests because they are not measures like 
temperature degrees or liters of liquid.
Nongenetic Approaches to Enhancing Intelligence: Shocking the Brain
• 
The idea that shocking the brain can enhance intelligence is an 
extension of a field called accelerated learning, and it’s exactly 
what the name implies. If it takes at least 10,000 hours to develop 
expertise at any skill—from chess to tennis to flying a helicopter—
wouldn’t it be nice to find a way to cut that time dramatically? 
Accelerated learning is more of a desire than a reality, but there is 
some recent progress.
• 
DARPA, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, has funded 
some research on using a small, one-to-two-milliamp current to 
mildly shock the brain indirectly through electrodes on the scalp. 
The shocks can be delivered, for example, when there is a correct 
response during computer simulation training sessions. 
• 
The mild shocks are thought to stimulate connections among 
brain areas, and there is some indication that the shocks result in 
better performance and faster learning. The technique is called 
Lecture 16: Can Intelligence Be Enhanced?

115
transcranial direct current stimulation. This is really in very early 
development, so do not try this at home; shocking the brain is not 
something to fool around with.
• 
However, if it actually works in research settings to increase 
learning, it may be possible to deliver more targeted stimulation 
directly to key brain areas related to intelligence—even using 
electrodes implanted into the brain, just like pacemakers for 
the heart or like implanted stimulators deep in the movement 
control areas of the brain now used for some people with  
Parkinson’s disease. 
• 
The brain areas identified in the P-FIT model could be targets 
for stimulation. There is some early research on this concept, 
using various methods to stimulate brain areas during learning 
and problem solving, but we don’t know yet if this approach  
actually works. 
• 
As with all brain research, the brain stimulation story is bound 
to be complicated, and negative effects could offset any positive 
effects. However, we might find ways to fix broken brain circuits 
for some cases of mental retardation or for some cases of  
learning disabilities.

Intelligence, Child Rearing, and Education
Lecture 17
I
n this lecture, you will learn about music and computer games. The 
theme that ties these popular topics together is that, when it comes to 
increasing IQ in children or influencing education, there is less than 
meets the eye. You will also learn about the potential for using brain imaging 
in education to help optimize how children learn. The ability to increase 
intelligence—whether g or specific factors—raises controversial questions 
and many ethical and policy issues concerning education, child rearing, and 
society in general.
Music and IQ
• 
Decades of research have not provided any clear roadmap for 
parents or educators when it comes to specific ways for increasing 
or maximizing IQ, let alone the g-factor. The following are four 
points we can make based on where the research is so far.
○
○
There is a difference between intelligence and achievement.
○
○
Of the two, intelligence is less influenced by motivation and 
external factors like poor education and poor parenting, 
although there may be some effects on intelligence and 
possibly the g-factor, especially on brain development.
○
○
Preventing brain damage from environmental sources like 
poison exposure, poor nutrition, or head injuries can limit 
lower IQs.
○
○
Despite evidence that IQ scores have been rising and that 
teenage IQs fluctuate, so far, there is no proven way to increase 
intelligence with training or stimulation, although there is some 
evidence that some early education programs can improve 
study skills and academic motivation. 

118
Lecture 17: Intelligence, Child Rearing, and Education
• 
There are two general assumptions that are guiding new research 
efforts. First, brain development in the first months of life, before 
preschool begins, is critical for language acquisition and likely for 
other key cognitive processes that underlie general intelligence 
and specific intelligence factors, but only within ranges set by 
genetic and epigenetic influences. Second, this means that each 
child already arrives at school with different patterns of cognitive 
strengths and weaknesses, so efforts to improve cognition need to 
be targeted in the early months and years of life.
• 
This is why there are now new, large research efforts to train or 
improve cognition aimed at children long before they get to 
preschool, especially disadvantaged children. These efforts often 
include computer games designed to target memory, attention, and 
problem solving, and some research studies now are including brain 
imaging to relate any test score improvements to brain changes.
• 
Based on existing research, there are a few general things that 
parents can do for optimal intelligence development in the first 
months and years of a child’s life. 
○
○
Breast-feeding may have small positive effects on IQ.
○
○
Good nutrition supports brain development in general, but 
specific foods to add or avoid are not clearly related to IQ, 
although there is some evidence that eating large amounts of 
junk food might decrease IQ scores slightly. 
○
○
In the home environment, more exposure to language may 
foster cognitive development—even in infants. This includes 
talking and reading to children. However, for example, it is not 
clear that teaching your child to read very early has any effects 
on IQ scores.
• 
Teachers at preschools and elementary schools should encourage all 
kinds of mental activities but should understand that some children 
will respond better than others–no matter how they try to motivate 
them–because children come with different patterns of cognitive 

119
strengths and weaknesses. These patterns are real and may limit 
a student’s academic progress in certain areas. Even if you could 
determine these patterns of cognitive strengths and weaknesses for 
each child, it is not yet clear how to change them or how to use this 
information to maximize learning in a traditional classroom.
Neuroeducation
• 
A new term—“neuroeducation”—has appeared that implies that 
we may know more than we do about education and the brain. 
Neuroeducation programs are now marketed to school systems with 
the promise to increase learning ability, memory, attention, and 
even IQ. Most of these programs are based on various computer 
games designed to train and improve children’s mental abilities.
• 
Research is underway to determine how effective such programs 
might be, but we don’t yet have enough research to really know. 
However, we can comment on how neuroeducation programs 
should be evaluated before tax dollars are spent. The following are 
four general points about evaluation.
○
○
Educator-researcher cooperation is necessary on a higher 
level than just educators agreeing to give researchers access 
to students. Educators should know fundamental neuroscience 
and basic research methods—very few know either. This is a 
shortcoming of many teacher education programs that can 
be corrected.
○
○
Researchers must be able to communicate with educators; 
this is not really that easy because researchers tend to 
talk in technical jargon and often do not see educators as  
equal collaborators.
○
○
There is an important role for educational psychologists if they 
have been trained in research methods and have knowledge of 
modern developmental psychology and basic neuroscience. 
Educational psychologists are a logical group to bring 
educators and researchers together.

120
○
○
Parents need to be informed about what works and what 
doesn’t based on research presented in understandable ways. 
This is a challenge for any school system, but success at this 
level is essential to bringing about any changes.
• 
A key concept to keep in mind while considering neuroeducation 
claims is that not all brains work the same. Each person has 
a different pattern of mental strengths and weaknesses, and 
students vary considerably on the g-factor. Therefore, any 
neuroeducational program may work for some students but not for 
others. Effectiveness might vary based on age, sex, current IQ, and 
socioeconomic status. Researching all of these possibilities and 
interactions is daunting but necessary.
• 
So far, research on outcomes of such programs tends to be limited 
to research done by the developers of the programs. Often, this 
research is not published in scientific journals subject to peer 
review. Independent replication of results is required. 
Computer Games and Learning
• 
In the study in 1992 that involved the computer game Tetris, 
researchers used PET scans to see brain changes before and after 
college students practiced for 50 days. There was less brain activity 
after practice, which suggested that the brain became more efficient 
even though the game was moving faster and becoming more 
difficult with practice.
• 
Subsequent research by others indicated that practicing a task might 
result in an increase in gray matter in those parts of the brain that 
work on the task. An increase in gray matter in an area could result 
in decreased brain activity in that area because there would be more 
neurons to do the work, and that brain area would be more efficient.
• 
If computer game training improves cognition, we should be able 
to identify where and how the brain changes and whether the brain 
changes last over time or disappear when training stops. 
Lecture 17: Intelligence, Child Rearing, and Education

121
• 
In 2009, the Tetris Company funded a replication of the 1992 
findings. This time, researchers used both structural and functional 
MRI to study 13-year-old girls who had little experience or interest 
in computer games. In addition, a newer version of Tetris was used. 
The girls that were tested practiced this version for three months, 
and they became quite good.
• 
After practice, there were decreases in activity for both the left and 
right hemispheres. These findings replicated the previous finding 
of efficiency. There also were gray matter increases after practice. 
These findings were new and demonstrated a structural brain 
change after learning this task.
• 
The surprise was that there is no overlap between these brain 
changes, so efficiency does not appear to be related to increased 
gray matter. Why these two kinds of brain changes are unrelated is 
a mystery, but this level of understanding is required to validate any 
claims of cognitive improvement.
Neurometric and Chronometric Brain Profiles
• 
There seems to be potential for brain imaging to evaluate a student’s 
profile of cognitive strengths and weaknesses and possibly suggest 
educational strategies to maximize that student’s learning based on 
the student’s brain image.
• 
Imagine that we have a very large, diverse group of individuals who 
get structural MRI scans. We could get the group average amount 
of gray matter in each P-FIT area, which is related to intelligence 
test scores. Assuming that the amount of gray matter in each area 
was normally distributed, some people would have more or less 
gray matter than the mean for each area. Some researchers refer to 
such brain quantification as neurometrics.
• 
Examples of neurometric brain profiles generally seem to have some 
validity in that the higher-IQ individuals have more gray matter in 
more brain areas that are thought to be related to intelligence. 

122
• 
We don’t yet have enough data to know whether such brain profiles 
predict g or other intelligence factors—or special mental abilities—
but this is research that is worth pursuing, especially if it potentially 
can help teachers design education strategies to maximize 
learning for every person based on how his or her particular brain  
is organized.
• 
How to change or improve a person’s brain structure or organization 
are different issues. Once we have more brain imaging studies of 
creativity, a P-FIT-type model could be possible, and creativity 
profiles may be useful.
• 
Brain profiles could also be based on chronometrics—reaction 
times to different cognitive tasks measured in a standardized way. 
This may be cheaper and more practical than brain imaging, but 
research will need to compare effectiveness of each approach.
Studies of students playing computer games have led to surprising results 
regarding brain activity.

Lecture 18
T
his course has covered a lot of ground—from savants to factor 
analysis, from IQ tests to geniuses, from genetics to brain imaging, 
and from shocking the brain to some provocative implications 
of neuroscience approaches to intelligence research. Perhaps the most 
important and controversial question of all is the following: If we could 
raise intelligence, should we? For any individual, we might find ways to 
increase intelligence—especially in terms of the g-factor—if we understand 
the brain mechanisms involved. This leads to the implications of enhancing 
intelligence, which is the subject of this final lecture. 
Cognitive Enhancement
• 
The term “cognitive enhancement” refers mostly to the use of drugs 
or food supplements to increase memory, attention, and learning. 
There is already considerable controversy about the use of drugs by 
students of all ages to get better test scores and higher grades. 
• 
In the future, we will hopefully be able to go a step further and 
improve intelligence, especially the g-factor, and maybe even 
specific factors like spatial or mathematical ability. If we can do 
this someday, then the issues and controversies will be even 
more complicated than those regarding drug use related to  
academic testing.
• 
There is not much disagreement with the goal of maximizing 
every person’s potential for learning, especially by improving 
environments—including diet. So many people use caffeine to get 
a mental boost that we hardly notice that this is drug use to increase 
mental performance. However, the use of stronger drugs to increase 
learning more dramatically is controversial.
• 
Similarly, the goal of changing a person’s intellectual potential 
by tinkering with environments is fairly well accepted. That’s 

125
why early education programs are so popular, but tinkering with 
neurobiology is far more controversial. 
• 
In many ways, the issue is the same as the issue of using drugs to 
enhance athletic ability. This is regarded as cheating because it is 
against the rules, but what if rules are changed to allow some kind 
of regulated drug enhancement?
• 
Although there are not yet really good memory-enhancing drugs, the 
following are some hypothetical questions for consideration if such 
drugs were to become available and had no negative side effects.
○
○
Is it cheating for a student to use drugs to enhance memory—
especially if the enhancement was for long-term memory so 
that the learned material was not forgotten right after the exam?
○
○
Is it cheating for a stockbroker to use memory-enhancing drugs 
to keep track of many variables?
○
○
Is it cheating for an older manager to use memory-enhancing 
drugs to compete with younger employees?
○
○
If you think some of these circumstances are okay, how would 
you feel about the President of the United States using such 
drugs to help remember details of many complex issues?
○
○
Instead of memory, what about using drugs to improve attention 
or learning?
• 
The science journal Nature took a survey in 2008 of 1,427 scientists 
about drugs and cognitive enhancement. They found that 20 percent 
of the scientists already used drugs to improve concentration, 70 
percent would risk mild side effects to boost brainpower, 80 percent 
defended the right to take such boosters, and more than 33 percent 
would feel pressure to give their children brain boosters if other 
kids used them.

126
• 
Cognitive enhancement with drugs for attention and learning is 
controversial. The following are some basic issues for debate.
○
○
Is it cheating?
○
○
Is it unnatural?
○
○
Is it drug abuse?
○
○
Is it safe?
○
○
Is it a matter of personal freedom? 
○
○
Is access to it fair? 
• 
The same issues are relevant if we could expand cognitive-enhancing 
drugs to include intelligence, g, or specific intelligence factors.
The Future of Using Drugs to Enhance Intelligence
• 
The concept of an IQ pill is metaphorical. It may be a drug that 
affects synaptic growth, neuron efficiency, gray matter thickness, or 
white matter integrity, or it may be a way to stimulate brain function 
with electricity or magnetic fields.
• 
Many drug companies are already working on new drugs to improve 
memory and learning for patients with Alzheimer’s disease, but if 
these new drugs work in patients, could they also work in people 
without brain disease to enhance memory and learning—two of the 
key components of general intelligence? 
• 
Few people would be against using such drugs if they improved 
cognition for people with Alzheimer’s disease, stroke patients, 
inpatients with brain damage, or people with mental retardation—
but what about people with no brain problems using such drugs?
• 
There are already drugs that improve attention in children with 
attention deficit disorder (ADD) like Adderall and Ritalin. Many 
parents want these drugs for non-ADD teenagers before they take 
Lecture 18: The IQ Pill

127
the SATs and other exams. These drugs are also in demand by 
many college students; estimates range from seven to 25 percent 
of college students use these drugs before exams. Despite their 
popularity, there doesn’t seem to be any research that supports these 
uses. Nonetheless, the idea of cognitive enhancement seems to be 
not only acceptable, but there also seems to be a strong demand 
from parents as well as from students. The following are some 
questions about this topic.
○
○
Assuming no side effects, and knowing what you have learned 
about the importance of g in everyday life, would you take an 
IQ pill if it put you in the top one percent of people?
○
○
Assuming no side effects, would you give an IQ pill to your 
children if it put them in the top one percent of students?
○
○
If an IQ pill existed, and you could get it, and knowing that IQ 
is measured relative to other people, would you want everyone 
else to have equal access to it?
○
○
If an IQ pill existed, and it was not cheaply available to 
everyone, what would you be willing to pay for it?
○
○
If you had the pill, what would you want to do that you can’t 
do now?
○
○
If you had a choice between an IQ pill and a pill that would 
dramatically increase your personal charisma, and you could 
only have one or the other, which would you choose?
○
○
If an IQ pill were possible, should the government ban it for 
any use?
• 
What if everyone were smarter by a half standard deviation—about 
seven or eight points? The normal distribution would shift to the 
right, so there would be more very bright people and fewer people 
at the low end, but there would still be a normal distribution. In 

128
some ways, this would be like accelerating the Flynn effect. Would 
there be anything bad about this? 
• 
Higher IQ could go either way for any individual; some might 
use more intelligence for nefarious purposes, but we’d also have 
smarter police, so for society as a whole, it would probably be 
positive. However, if only some people had access to intelligence 
enhancement, what would be the consequences—especially if they 
could increase their IQs to over 150? 
• 
We already have sociological evidence that our increasingly 
complex society is more divided than ever between the upper 
and lower groups, and intelligence differences clearly contribute 
to the disparities. It’s possible that someday, and perhaps not that 
far off, the ability to enhance intelligence will be real, and there 
will be many problems to discuss and work out—just like many 
If there were an IQ pill, many people would struggle with the ethics surrounding 
taking a drug to increase mental capacity.

other social problems introduced by other advances in science  
and medicine.
• 
More scientific information is almost always better than less, even 
when the findings go against our common beliefs or our personal 
interests. The key to scientific progress is to go where the data takes 
you. Ignorance and prejudice flourish in the absence of information. 
• 
Nature is the way it is, no matter how we think it should be, but 
once empirical facts become known through scientific inquiry, there 
is always the possibility of changing nature. In the long run, this is 
how civilization progresses and how we help improve the quality of 
life for everyone. 
• 
Research is always a work in progress; no single study can answer 
complex questions, and there are always more questions than 
answers. The following are some research questions about brain-
intelligence relationships for the near future, each of which would 
require an extensive research program.
○
○
Regarding the brain, how does gray and white matter develop 
and change in ways related to intelligence?
○
○
How is information processed throughout the brain differently 
in high- and low-IQ individuals?
○
○
Are 
there 
properties 
of 
individual 
neurons 
that  
influence intelligence? 
○
○
Can we increase g by stimulating the brain by any means—
from increased language exposure to drugs to electrical shocks?
