1-1 INTRODUCTION 
f
Cryogenic fluids may loosely be defined as those fluids whose normal boiling tem­
peratures at atmospheric pressure are below 273 K. This definition includes the more 
common cryogens such as helium, hydrogen, neon, nitrogen, oxygen, argon, krypton, 
xenon, methane, ethane, and propane. Carbon dioxide should be included even though 
a pressure of over 5 atmospheres is required to maintain it in liquid form. Other fluids 
that fit the definition but are rarely used at temperatures below 273 K include carbon 
monoxide, nitrogen trifluoride, hydrogen sulfide, and some higher hydrocarbons.
The chemical reactivity of cryogenic fluids varies from nil for the noble gases to
potentially explosive for hydrogen and the hydrocarbons and very dangerously reactive 
for liquid oxygen.
A general description of thermophysical fluid properties is given in Section 1-2 of 
this chapter. Tables of properties for particular fluids (He, Ar, H2, N2,02) are presented 
in section 1-3.
1-2 THERMOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS
Thermophysical fluid properties may be subdivided into state properties and transport 
properties. State properties relate to a static fluid element essentially unperturbed by 
any temperature gradient or fluid motion; they include pressure, volume, and tempera­
ture relationships, specific heats, compressibilities, and energies. These are reviewed in 
section 1-2-1.
Transport properties relate to the transport of energy or momentum through the 
fluid. They are more difficult to calculate from first principles, but adequate empirical 

2 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
descriptions exist. The thermal conductivity and viscosity of fluids are reviewed in 
section 1-2-2.
Computer programs are widely used to calculate fluid properties. Some available 
programs are discussed in section 1-2-3.
1-2-1 Fluid State Properties
The Fluid Phase Diagram. The fluid phase diagram for oxygen, Figure 1-1, is typical 
of that for all fluids except helium. The pressure, density, and temperature at the critical 
point are denoted Pc, pc, and Tc, respectively. These critical parameters provide the 
scaling by which state properties of various fluids may be compared one with another. 
The melting and saturation lines intersect at the triple point, which is identified with Pt, pt, 
and Tt. Il is important to note that the saturation line exhibits an apparent extension above
Tc shown as a dashed line in Fig. l-l. The dashed line is known as the transposed critical 
line or the critical isochore and is the locus of peaks in some fluid properties, as is 
discussed later (e.g., specific heat). The peaks diminish in size as the temperature is 
raised, becoming ill-defined at several times Tc.
The phase diagram for helium, Fig. 1-2, is unique in that the melting line and the
saturation line do not intersect even at the limit of absolute zero temperature but are

PROPERTIES OF CRYOGENIC FLUIDS 3
separated by the superfluid range (often denoted He II) and the lambda line. Above the 
critical temperature, helium exhibits a transposed critical line and properties that are 
consonant with those of other fluids.
One other special feature of helium should be mentioned. The ordinary helium atom 
is of mass 4, 4He. In any container of helium, about IO"4 % of the helium atoms will be 
the rare 3He isotope. When 3He is prepared in pure liquid form (generally by radioactive 
decay of 3Li), its properties are much different from those presented in Fig. 1-2. For 
example, 3He does not become superfluid until cooled to a few millikelvin, where it then 
can exist in two alternative superfluid states. Although 3He is fascinating to study, it is 
so rare that we do not consider it further in this chapter.
Hydrogen also deserves special attention. It can be in either of two molecular states:
para-hydrogen, with the two nuclear spins opposing each other, and ortho-hydrogen, with 
the two nuclear spins parallel to each other. It happens that para-hydrogen has the lower 
ground-state energy and is the preferred state at low temperature. At room temperature, 
the thermal energy is enough to keep both quantum states fully occupied, which means 
that 3/4 of the hydrogen molecules will be in the ortho state, and the remainder will 
be in the para state. This 3/4-1/4 mixture is termed normal hydrogen. At liquid tem­
perature, all the hydrogen molecules will eventually revert to the para state. However, 

4 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
the transition rate from ortho to para at low temperature is very slow (hours or days) 
unless catalyzed, and it is possible to obtain normal liquid hydrogen in the laboratory. At 
intermediate temperatures it is possible in principle to achieve an equilibrium hydrogen 
with intermediate ortho-para ratios; however, this equilibrium state is rarely achieved 
in ordinary laboratory practice. The problem with this ortho-para conversion is that 
it releases heat, causing boil-off of surrounding liquid. This is usually solved using 
catalysts in the hydrogen liquefier to create nominally pure para-hydrogen liquid.
It turns out that some normal hydrogen properties differ measurably from those 
of para-hydrogen. The most prominent differences are in specific heats, illustrated in 
Fig. 1-3, and thermal conductivity, illustrated in Fig. 1-4, The specific heat differences 
are pronounced roughly in the range of 50 to 400 K and disappear in the liquid range, 
even at high density. The conductivity differences appear below about 300 K and are 
most prominent in the compressed liquid. (It is possible that the greater critical point 
enhancement seen for the normal hydrogen in Fig. I -4 is an artifact of the fitting process.) 
It is interesting to note that, by contrast, the differences between the viscosity of para 
and normal hydrogen are essentially negligible, as seen in Fig. 1-5. Other properties

line = para-hydrogen).

that share this approximate equality are the density, expansivity, compressibility, sound 
velocity, and triple and critical point parameters.
In the following presentation, many thermodynamic quantities have been normalized 
to the critical pressure, temperature, or density. Table 1-1 lists triple point and critical 
point values for many cryogens. Also listed is the normal boiling point, NBP, at standard 
atmospheric pressure.
Scaling laws. Figure 1-6 shows the pressure as a function of temperature along the 
saturation line for several fluids, By normalizing the pressure and temperature to their 
respective critical values for each fluid, one finds that the saturation pressures differ by no

more than a few percent from each other, except for hydrogen and helium The location 
of the triple point along the quasiuniversal saturation line shows no obvious correlation 
with any other fluid property
The slope of the saturation lines on the log-log graph of Fig 1-6 is about 7 for 
most fluids and about 4 for helium An easy way to remember the Clausius-Clapeyron 
equation is to recognize that this (dimensionless) slope is equal to the ratio of latent heat 
to PdV work in a liquid to-vapor transition at constant pressure
Hydrogen and helium properties are influenced by quantum effects at low tem­
peratures and thus do not scale as well to properties of other fluids For hydrogen, 
the scaling is further confused by two different forms of hydrogen, para-hydrogen and

“Triple point values for helium arc those of the lambda poim
ortho-hydrogen, discussed in the preceding paragraphs The quantum effects m hehurh 
properties are evidenced by the superfluid phase seen in Fig 1-2
For other cryogens, it is generally true that properties can be scaled from one fluid 
to another with an accuracy that is adequate for understanding and review of properties, 
as in this chapter Evidence for this is seen in Fig 1-6 and can be developed for other 
parameters if necessary This scaleability of fluid properties is known generally as the 
“law of corresponding states ”
As an example, if you wished to use these figures to find the density of xenon at 
200 K and 580 kPa, you would divide these values respectively by the critical temperature 
and pressure for xenon listed in Table 1-1 and find the intersection of these reduced 
values on Fig 1-7 The corresponding y coordinate would then be multiplied by the 
critical density (also found in Table 1-1) to yield the desired density (in this case it 
is ~44 kg/m3) More accurate data may be found using the tables in section 1-3 or the 
computer codes described in section 1-2-3
Most properties in Figs 1 7 to 1-13 have been calculated from an accurate state 
equation for oxygen The figures would be little changed had they been calculated from 
an accurate state equation for any of the other cryogens
Nomenclature and definitions. The use of dimensionless parameters makes it easier to 
scale properties from one fluid to another The following scahn
factors and definitions
are useful
Gas constant = energy per mole — R = 8.31441 ± 0 00026 J mol~! K-1 For a 
fluid of known molecular weight, M, it is common practice to define an effective 
gas constant by the quotient R/M with units of energy/mass This permits easy 
translation into other units systems

Density. The normalized densities (p/pc) (for oxygen) are shown in Fig. 1-7 as a func­
tion of normalized temperature (T/Tc), along lines of constant normalized pressure 
(P/Pc). The circles connected by dotted lines are saturated liquid and vapor states on 
the saturation line.
Specific heats. In Figs. 1-8 and 1-9 the oxygen specific heats Cp/R and Cy/R are 
plotted as a function of T/Tc along selected isobars from P/Pc = 0.03 to P/Pc = 7. On 
both figures, the circles connected by dashed lines are, respectively, saturated liquid and 
vapor states on the saturation line. It should be noted that the specific heat curves for 
the monatomic gases would be reduced in magnitude by an amount 1.0 (in C/R units).
Note the dramatic difference between these two figures. The peaks in CP for P/ Pc > 
1 lie on the transposed critical line; CP rises to infinity at the critical temperature and to 
very high values over an appreciable temperature range. On the other hand, Cv exhibits 
much less temperature variation over the whole range and has a visible rise of only a 
few percent very close to the critical temperature. In fact, theory says that Cy does 
go to infinity at the critical point, but the peak is so narrow that our accurate fluid 
properties equation gives no more than a hint of it. The same dramatic difference is 
seen in Fig. 1-10, where the specific heats along the saturation line and the transposed 
critical line are plotted. It should be further noted that isobars for the specific heat ratio 
y = CP/Cy also rise to high peaks along the transposed critical line in a way that is 
qualitatively similar to the CP data.
Thermal expansivity. The normalized thermal expansivity (for oxygen) is plotted
Fig. 1-11 as a function of normalized temperature (T/Tc) along isobars P jPc. As with 
the CP plots, the circles lie on the saturation line, and the peaks lie on the transposed 
critical line.
Compressibility and sound velocity. Isothermal and isentropic compressibilities, Kt 
and Ks, are plotted in Figs. 1-12 and 1-13 as functions of reduced temperature (T/Tc) 
along isobars (P/Pc). It is important to note the qualitative difference between these 
two figures. The isothermal compressibility is sharply peaked along the transposed 
critical line, whereas the isentropic compressibility shows no hint of any enhancement 
in the transposed critical range. Sound velocities, m Fig. 1-14, are calculated from the 
isothermal compressibility and are plotted as a function of temperature along isobars. 
For an ideal gas, the sound velocity is

where y = 5/3 for an monatomic gas, 7/5 for diatomic gas. The sound velocities in 
Fig. 1-14 have been normalized by dividing by the ideal gas value of the sound velocity at 
that temperature (i.e., using the ideal gas value of y rather than the y that would be calcu­
lated at that state point). For pressures less than the critical pressure, the ideal gas predic­
tion yields a reasonable estimate for sound velocity at temperatures above about 1.1 Tc.
The J-T coefficient. The Joule-Thomson (i/0 coefficient is a measure of cooling (or 
wanning) that can be obtained from an infinitesimal isenthalpic expansion. The dimen­
sionless coefficient is plotted in Fig. 1-15 as a function of reduced temperature (T/Tc) 
along isobars (P/Pe). At supercritical pressures, the peaks of the curves lie approxi­
mately along the transposed critical line. The value of at the critical point is equal to 
the value of PV/RT at the critical point, which is 0.288 for oxygen and is typically 0.25 
to 0.3 for most fluids. Away from the critical point, values of will always be less.
Theoretical framework. The state equation is a single therm iynamic function from
which all static properties of the fluid can be derived. In principle, the state equation

of a pure fluid can be developed from a mathematical description of the interaction of a 
single molecule with all of its neighbors. The natural coordinates used in such theoretical 
development arc the interatomic spacing (i.c., the density) and the temperature. It is very 
difficult to derive an accurate state equation by just this process; nevertheless, most 
commonly used (empirical) fluid state equations do utilize density and temperature as 
the two independent thermodynamic parameters. The ideal gas equation provides the 
simplest example. It may be written in terms of the Helmholtz potential A(p, T) as
A(p, T) - RT(]ogp - a
T + Sq)
(1-15)
where the constant a = 3/2 for a monatomic gas, 5/2 for a diatomic gas, and so forth. 
The So is an adjustable constant that sets the zero of entropy. All state properties can be 
obtained from A(p, T) using classical thermodynamics relationships.
Virial state equations add an extra term or two to describe dense single- phase fluids 
with reasonable accuracy, such as
P(p, T) - pRT\\ + B(T)p + C(T)p2]

with the caution that there is some theoretical uncertainty whether the second term should 
be written as shown above or as C(T)p2 log (p). Virial equations can be useful for cal­
culations in a restricted fluid range, but the coefficients B and C are not conveniently 
tabulated in the literature for most fluids. To calculate specific heats and compressibil­
ities, it is necessary to evaluate the first and second temperature derivatives of B and C.
Virial equations are sometimes generalized by replacing the term [1 + B(T}p + 
C(T)p2] with a single parameter Z, usually called the “compressibility factor.” Graphs 
of Z as a function of P and T are available for many cryogenic fluids, and a few 
equations for Z(P, T) have been published. However, equations of this form have not 
been successful in predicting compressed liquid properties.
The van der Waals equation is representative of several fairly simple equations that 
predict fluid critical points and liquid-vapor separation with semiquantitative accuracy. 
These equations are used for quantitative calculations only in the absence of more accu­
rate equations, as discussed in the next paragraph,

State equations, which are the accepted standard in commerce, typically have 20 to
50adjustable parameters in the expression for A(py T) carefully fitted by least-squares 
analysis to a variety of experimental data for any particular fluid. A common equation of
this type is the Benedict-Webb-Rubin (BWR) [1] equation with 32 adjustable parame­
ters. Many of the newer state equations (e.
for halogenated hydrocarbon refrigerants,
ammonia, and water) are based on a more generalized potential function sometimes 
referred to as the Wagner equation [2], These multiparameter equations are practical for 
use only in computerized form.
Influence of the critical point. Figures 1-8 to 1-12 show that many derivative prop­
erties (specific heats, expansivity, isothermal compressibilities, etc.) diverge to infinity 
as the critical point is approached. Extensive theoretical and experimental studies of 
critical-point phenomena have yielded specialized equations that do describe individual J

fluid properties asymptotic to the critical point. However, such equations are always 
nonanalytic at the critical point, and it has proven mathematically impossible to in­
clude these asymptotically correct equations within a thermodynamic potential function 
(e.g., in a BWR or Wagner-type equation). The important conclusion for this work is 
that the fluid properties illustrated here are increasingly inaccurate as the critical point 
is approached. The inaccuracy may be quite significant when the density is within 
about 20% of the critical density and the temperature is within about 2% of the Critical 
temperature.
Strongly and weakly divergent parameters, the critical point, and liquid-vapor 
mixtures. Strongly divergent parameters are those that become large at appreciable dis­
tances from the critical point and along the transposed critical line. From Figs. 1-8 to 
1-12, it can be seen that these parameters include a, Cp, K-^ and y. These strongly 
divergent parameters are undefined, or may be said to equal infinity, in a liquid-vapor

mixture. Weakly divergent parameters are those that appear essentially unperturbed by 
proximity to the critical point until they arc extremely close to the critical point, where 
they do diverge to infinity. Available state equations or graphs usually do not display the 
divergence. Weakly divergent parameters include C’v, K's, Kh, (1/0), and(l/c). All of 
these weakly divergent state parameters can be defined for a constant-volume container 
of a liquid-vapor mixture in terms of the saturated liquid properties, the saturated vapor 
properties, and the vapor mass fraction, if one assumes complete thermodynamic equi­
librium between liquid and vapor. This is in interesting contrast to the strongly divergent 
parameters that cannot be defined for such a container. However, such definitions of 
mixture properties are rarely published or used. In practice, the condition of complete 
thermodynamic equilibrium for a liquid-vapor mixture may be hard to establish. For 
example, the predicted sound velocity in a liquid-vapor mixture is extremely low, much

1-2-2 Thermal Conductivity and Viscosity
Thermal conductivity and viscosity are properties related to the transfer of energy and 
momentum through the fluid. These properties are not predictable from the state equa­
tion, nor are they easily predictable from models of molecular interactions. However, 
their qualitative behavior is fairly easy to describe.
Superfluid helium is a special case, because energy and mass transfer mechanisms
are closely related to extended state properties (i.e., to second and fourth sound veloci­
ties, the superfluid density fraction, and the mutual friction parameter). A discussion of
superfluid transfer processes is
iven in chapter 10 of this handbook.

Isotherms of the viscosity, p, of oxygen as a function of density are shown in 
Fig. 1-16. The equivalent curves for other fluids are qualitatively very similar. The first 
point to note is that the ideal gas state Mo(D (i.e„ the y-intercepts in Fig. 1-16) can be 
approximated by the equation
Mo = const. Tn, with n % 0.7
(1-17)
The constant will be unique for each fluid.
For nonzero fluid density, the viscosity data are fitted to reasonable accuracy by an 
equation
M = Mo(T’) + 
+ M2(P, T)
(M8)

20 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
The Mi term is known as the first density correction. The M2 term represents the steeply 
rising viscosity in the high-density range (e.g., in the compressed liquid); a simple power 
senes expansion may provide an adequate fit. Both of these terms are always positive. A 
very important feature of Fig. 1-16 is that the viscosity data are essentially unperturbed 
by proximity to the critical point or saturation line. It is probable that highly precise 
viscosity data extremely close to the critical point would show some anomalies, but for 
practical purposes they can be ignored. In other terms, fluid viscosity functions are (at 
most) weakly divergent at the critical point.
Figure 1-17 shows analogous data for the thermal conductivity, X, of oxygen. The 
same general trends as in the viscosity data of Fig. 1-16 can be discerned but with

added superposition of a significant perturbation when the density and temperature are 
not too far from their critical values or the saturation line. In other terms, the thermal 
conductivity function is strongly divergent at the critical point.
It is found that the ideal gas thermal conductivity is fitted approximately by the 
analog to Eq. (1-17), that is
Ao = const. T'*,  with n ~ 0.7 
(1-19)
However, Eq. (1.18) is replaced by
X = X0(T) 4- Xj(T)p + X2(p, T) + Mp/Pc, T/Tq}
(1-20)
where the Xc term represents the critical anomaly. Fairly complex equations for Xc have 
been considered. For accurate work, it is best to use existing computer programs to 
calculate the thermal conductivity outside of the ideal gas limit.
The Prandtl number, Pr, is a dimensionless parameter that occurs prominently in heat 
and mass transfer studies. Conceptually it is a ratio of energy transferred by convection 
to energy transferred by conduction. It is defined as
Pr = mCp/X 
(1-21)
For most common fluids, the Prandtl number is about 0.7, except close to the critical 
point where the divergence in all three parameters p,, Cp, and X is important. Values of 
Pr close to the critical point have not been widely studied to our knowledge. Predicted 
values of the Prandtl number for oxygen near its critical point are shown in Fig. 1-18. 
The Prandtl number is strongly divergent near the critical point.
1-2-3 Computer Programs for Fluid Properties
Fluid properties are available in computer form from several sources. The U.S. De­
partment of Commerce offers the NIST-12 “standard reference” program, formerly dis­
tributed under the name MIPROPS [3]. This program contains properties of 17 fluids, 
including transport properties, where they are available. The Center for Advanced Ther­
modynamics at the University of Idaho offers ALLPROPS, which contains state proper­
ties of 42 fluids but no transport properties [4]. Cryodata, Inc., offers GASPAK, which 
contains properties of 32 fluids [5], including transport properties, where they are avail­
able. The NIST-12 program uses only BWR equations, whereas ALLPROPS and GAS­
PAK include BWR equations as a subset of Wagner-type equations. All three of these 
computer programs arc directly referenced to high-quality professional publications of 
fluid properties data. Special programs for helium properties, including superfluid prop­
erties down to 0.8 K and near-lambda-line properties, are available (a) as a subset of
NIST-12 and (b) from Cryodata, Inc.
Information on where to order these programs is listed in section 1-4.

gen, argon, oxygen, and para-hydrogen. The tabular data listed here have been generated

accuracy of the programs and thus of these tables is given in Table 1-2. An exception to 
the listed accuracy occurs in the critical region. This region is defined as being within 
20% of the critical density at temperatures within 2% of the critical temperature. The 
errors in this region are very high, and calculations in this region should be avoided if
possible.

PROPERTIES OF CRYOGENIC FLUIDS 71
Notice that for the fluids other than helium, there are cases where the listed entropy 
and enthalpy values are negative. Although this may seem counterintuitive, recall that 
entropy and enthalpy are not absolute and must be compared with a reference value.
The third law of thermodynamics defines a fluid’s entropy as zero at zero temperature 
and defined pressure. From this definition, a standard reference value (usually at 1 
atmosphere and 298 K) may be calculated. In general, the reference values for entropy 
and enthalpy used in GASPAK and HEPAK agree with those recommended by the
CODATA and organization. In some cases, the absolute values of entropy and enthalpy 
in these tables may differ from those in other sources, but the differences between any 
two states (which are the only physically meaningful values) will be the same.

2-1 FRICTION COEFFICIENTS AND RELATED PHENOMENA
T. H. K. Frederking
UCLA, BH5531 SEAS/Chem E, Los Angeles. CA 90095
2-1-1 Introduction
This section addresses tribology at low temperatures (T). Tribology, the study of fric­
tion, considers, among other phenomena, friction forces that act at the external boundary 
common to two materials. The real interface usually has a nonplanar (i.e., imperfect) 
domain structure with departures from a mathematical plane. Therefore, considerable 
complexity involving numerous material combinations is encountered. Data at low T 
are scarce; consequently, various tribology subdisciplines outside the cryotemperature 
range are mentioned. Often, room temperature data are the only results that provide order 
of magnitude (OOM) hints.

74 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
Examples of tribology phenomena are Earth tectonics [ 1 ], traction on tires for road 
vehicles, dissipation of energy reduction m oil-lubricated bearings, drag reduction in 
dilute polymer-water solutions [2], and polymer-coated windings m magnets and elec­
trical systems
Static friction is required at the tires of road vehicles for force transmission The 
order of the friction coefficient is unity on dry roads but 0 1 or less on wet or icy roads 
Similarly, gear trains with polymer belts require sufficient friction
Dynamic conditions are encounteied in bearings A lowering of friction by oil films 
aims at reducing losses associated with energy dissipation Huge economic benefits 
derive from an improved bearing tribology
Polymers

 play an important role as construction materials (e g , Kevlar [3]) and 
as insulators (e g , Kapton) in magnets and other electrical systems Sliding motion 
is characterized by a friction coefficient on the order of magnitude of 0 4 up to 10 N/mm2
Solid lubricants may replace liquids Examples are molybdenum disulfide (MoS?), 
graphite, and carbides An early literature compilation of NASA is Ref [4] (compare 
also Clauss 1972 [20])
Nanotribology [5,6] is a recent subdiscipline aiming at optimization of lubrication 
in advanced small-scale systems Examples of related physics investigations are found 
m Refs [7] and [8]
At low temperatures (T), naturally the question of T-effects on friction arises Early 
data indicate that in some cases the friction coefficient decreases as T is lowered [9] 
Other results show a constant coefficient [10] Recent work indicates the additional 
possibility of a friction coefficient increase as T is decreased
In the foliowin
subsections, static [11] and dynamic friction coefficients are ad­
dressed Next, experimental methods simulating complex tribology scenarios are out­
lined Subsequently, applied superconductivity magnet phenomena are outlined They 
constitute a significant part (partially unexplored) of the cryotechnology spectrum The 
magnets pose challenges of quantification of friction Related magnet tribology in static 
and dynamic scenarios will be discussed
Because of considerable tribology complexity, it is emphasized that data may be 
interpreted from more than only one point of view
2-1-2 Phenomena of Static and Dynamic Friction
Static phenomena are characterized by the ability to avoid slippage in a restricted range 
of parameters An example is the ladder placed at standard gravity at a vertical wall At 
a particular angle, a static limit is reached Dynamic phenomena are initiated This 
point of view has been extended to some magnet winding systems At a certain limiting 
parameter set, static phenomena are replaced by dynamic events They include stick- 
shp known from other areas of tribology Thus, static tribology is replaced by dynamic 
tribology at a particular set of parameters At present, magnet experience indicates a 
predominance of sliding motion in large-scale systems This implies a great significance 
of dynamic tribology in experiments

Figure 2-1 Schematic of a static fnction model 
system Two model asperities (cones C) indicate 
symbolically real conditions of a rough surface 
(rtxi denotes externally applied force rn is the 
normal reaction force component 'and F? sig­
nifies the tangential reaction force component 
which is equal to the fnction force)
Dynamic phenomena are characterized by relative motion of the two materials once 
forces have been switched on An example is the start-up of magnet operation The 
individual winding "sees” a magnet-fieid-related resulting force The hoop-stress-related 
normal force component and the tangential component are superposed vectonally As 
the electrical current and the associated magnetic field are increased, the forces increase 
During this energization process, there exists a finite chance that static conditions will
be changed to dynamic phenomena
Relative motion of a winding takes place with
respect to an adjacent winding or substrate material Upon initiation of relative mo­
tion, dynamic friction is established We turn next to a quantification of simplified 
tribology
Static friction (zero relative motion). Figure 2-1 presents an ideal static system schema­
tically and symbolically The force F is applied externally to the body located above 
a plane symbolizing a substrate material Two cone shaped asperities are protruding 
from the upper body The cones constitute “macroroughness” replacing symbolically 
numerous microasperities of the real surface For an applied normal force Fn there is a 
relatively large tangential component in the contact plane
As a result of external force application, first elastic deformation takes place in the 
low force range Included in Fig 2 1 are reactive force components The normal force
component Fn counteracts the applied force in the vertical direction The tangential
component F? represents the static friction and is in the range 0 < a < F? = Fntana
For the tnbostatics up to the limiting angle there exists a limiting envelope of the static 
range The limiting topology is an ao-cone for an ideal sphere geometry There is a 
limiting wedge for the ideal cylinder Thus, static friction conditions are realized ideally 
when the following inequality is satisfied
Ff < Fn tan ag
(2-1)
The ideal toj
logy limit is characterized by the following static friction coefficient
Mo = FiJFn = tan
(2-2)

76 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
This friction coefficient /to depends on material and surface parameters. Because real 
surfaces are not ideal, there are departures from the ideal limiting topology.
In this context, wc note elastic deformation by normal force alone for a sphere 
pair or sphere-plane, sphere-cylinder geometry, and others. For the simple systems, the 
Hertz theory is available for the quantification of elastic deformations (e.g., Ref. [12]). 
A pair of identical materials, for instance, is characterized by the following results: the 
ratio of the deformed domain radius to the sphere radius is proportional to the third root 
of the applied (normal) force and proportional to the reciprocal third root of Young’s 
modulus.
The general dependence of deformation on the specific normal force "pressure” is 
more complicated than the Hertz theory. Further complexity arises from coatings. There 
is the additional tangential component. Thus, the static friction coefficient depends on a 
multitude of parameters. Among them are the surface domain compositions, structure, 
and concentration of chemical and physical “impurities." Further, the presence of fluid 
films and solid coatings is important as well as the related temperature and pressure- 
dependent thermophysical properties. As the external force is increased, shear causes 
plastic deformation or fracture of the cone-like asperities indicated in Fig. 2-1.
Dynamic friction—Coulomb’s law. Dynamic friction involves sliding at a relative 
velocity v > 0. As the applied force is increased beyond the static limit, there is a 
transition into the dynamic range characterized by relative motion of the two materi­
als. In experiments simulating the friction of complex systems, usually one material 
is kept stationary, and the second one is moving with the speed v. For the dynamic 
range, Coulomb’s law describes the phenomena using a dynamic friction coefficient (/z^) 
(Fig- 2-2).
g = Fp/Fp = tan ft
(2-3)
In Fig. 2-2, Fcm is the externally applied force. Further, the components of the reactive 
force are shown with friction Ff and normal force Fn. Friction acts in the tangential plane.

versus strain and (b) force versus velocity (v). (DL denotes the dry lubircation regime, and WL signifies the 
wet lubricant such as the organic lubricant film m the hydrodynamic region.)
Comparing Figs. 2-1 and 2-2 for the same normal force, we have a decreased dynamic 
tangential force compared with the static range. For polymer-coated metals, the dynamic 
friction coefficient (p) is below unity. Thus, the angle p is less than 45°. The dynamic 
/z-values depend on the parameters for static friction discussed above. In addition, the 
lubrication technique applied to the bodies is important (e.g., “dry friction,” special 
coatings, presence of fluid lubricant). Thus, there is no constant friction coefficient in
Coulomb’s law in general (see Fig. 2-3).
Complicated conditions are created in superconducting magnets. In some winding 
geometries using the composite NbTi-Cu, the domain structure involves the material 
sequence copper-Form var-cryoliquid residue/solid co nde nsate-Fo rm var—copper. Each 
subdomain in general has individual Young modulus values and shear modulus values.
They do not necessarily match each other. In cryoliquid-free magnets, there is no fluid 
matter within the contact domains.
It has been remarked that very small dynamic friction coefficients (Md = 0-05) 
have been observed with ice-ice systems. The sliding velocity has been on the order of 
magnitude of 1 cm/s [13].
Stick-slip phenomena. In a friction simulation test with two material pairs (one sta­
tionary, one moving), well-defined conditions are aimed at. First, small, finite velocities 
(v > 0) are imposed. The external load is increased and with it the tangential reactive 
force component Fp. Eventually, the static limit is exceeded. A possible consequence is 
local yielding of surface asperity material and local slippage. The force is reduced to a 
low level. Upon continued application of shear, pressure builds up again, and a second 
slip event takes place. Aside from steady sliding, oscillations are possible as well. For 
magnets, these scenarios have been studied at low temperatures (e.g., Refs. [14] and 
[15]).
Stick-slip phenomena are not restricted to magnet scenarios. They have been ob­
served in several tribology areas. Common features are observed for both metals and 
nonmetals.

2-1-3 Experimental Methods
Examples of experimental systems are shown schematically in Figs. 2-4 to 2-8 (e.g., 
Refs. [ 15-17] and others. Figure 2-4 displays the pin-on-plate system. The pin is moved 
across the surface of the disk, permitting plowing action in some materials. The results 
are relatively high friction coefficients on the order of magnitude of unity for metal-metal 
systems, (e.g., Refs. [9] and [10]).
Figure 2-5 schematically depicts the arrangement of Artoos et al. [17]. A flat slab 
of one material is placed into a clamping system whose fingers consist of the second 
material. The normal force is applied to the clamps in a horizontal direction. Recipro­
cating motion permits repetitive load cycles.
Figure 2-6 schematically displays the disk-disk geometry of Kensley and Iwasa [15, 
16]. The upper rotating disk is in contact with a lower stationary disk. Several variations 
of this geometry have been developed [15].
Figure 2-7 shows a schematic drawing of the tribology simulation system for su­
perconducting composite samples of Ref. [18]. There is a helical Cu~wire clamping 
scheme around the central, vertical conductor. The lacquer-coated Cu-helix, in turn, 
is located inside a clamping system applying a normal force. The assembly is sur­
rounded by a magnet coil providing a longitudinal field with respect to the vertical con­
ductor (transverse to the Cu-helix). Upon external force (Fexl) application, significant

friction arises during relative motion of the sample with respect to stationary surround­
ings. The sample is pulled with a speed of 0.02 to 0.2 mm/min. Aside from fric­
tion force information, quench zone formation-related flux motion is detected by a
pickup coil (not shown in Fig. 2-7). Thus, the quench kinetics are monitored in the
system.

The normal force Fn is applied from the top via a cardanic suspension.
Concerning other diagnostic tools, the technique of acoustic emission (AE) is men­
tioned (e.g., Ref. [21]). The AE is capable of registering internal friction events (e.g., 
prequench and quench activities inside a superconducting material). Results suggest that 
tribology surface-domain events are potentially accessible to AE methods.
2-1-4 Friction Data
Figure 2-9 is a plot of high friction coefficients of investigators (Refs. [9,10]), as compiled 
by Kim in 1978 [22]. The data show a weak temperature dependence of the friction factor 
for Cu-Cu and a noticeable 7-dependence for Ni-Ni. Plowing action of the pin-slab 
system (Fig. 2-4) causes relatively high friction coefficients.
Figure 2-10 shows recent pin-on-slab data reported by Yokoi and Okada [23] for an
applied force of 3 kgf (approximately 30 N). A hard pin of 18-8 stainless steel has been 
used on soft plates of PTFE and Al-4% Cu at 300 and 16 K. The friction force versus 
load function observed is slightly nonlinear. There are oscillations at relatively low load.
Figure 2-11 shows selected friction data of the Francis Bitter National Magnet 
Laboratory (FBNML) (Ref. [15]). Included are “peak” friction coefficient (jz = /zd) 
results deduced from the maximum values of a series of dynamic friction experiments

of Kensley and Iwasa (15}. In the dynamic runs, the velocity v is increased. Associated 
with the u-rise is an increase of the friction up to a particular point, the “peak.” At this 
high-load condition, a sudden drop in the friction coefficient occurs. The peak value is
designated as /zp. The stick-slip sequence is interpreted as local surface stress release. 
The inset of Fig. 2-11 displays the stick-slip event schematically. There are several types
of post-peak phenomena, including oscillations (e.
M Ref. [15]).

for (O) Cu-teflon-coated GIO [15] and (0) Cu-GFRP plate [24] The inset schematically shows m versus time 
stick—slip record on the basis of Ref, [15],
The friction data of Fig. 2-11 are representative examples for specific conditions 
[15]. For instance, the dynamic coefficient (/z) for the pair Cu-GlO shows a monotonic 
increase with temperature. In contrast, the pair A1-G10 displays a decrease of /z as T 
is increased. The peak data (T) show a weak decrease as T is raised. An additional 
set of data of Ref. [24] is included in Fig. 2-11 for copper in contact with GFRR These 
latter results are quite consistent with the Cu-GlO results [15] as far as d^/dT and the 
magnitude are concerned.
Figure 2-12 shows dynamic friction coefficients for various pairs investigated at 
CERN [17]. The data are in part very close to the FBNML results [15]. The low value 
of an M0S2 varnish layer near 0.05 has been achieved at room temperature. At low T, 
this attractive feature got lost: relatively high g-values have been found instead with the 
coatings used in Ref. [17].
The comparison of various results suggests that a large set of variables affects low- 
temperature tribology. Improvements are possible in various directions. For instance,

friction sliding across relatively small distances. Particular magnet aspects are outlined 
in section 2-1-5.
2-1-5 Magnet TY-ibology and Related Parameters
*
After introduction of a classification scheme, magnet tribology is considered. Friction 
modeling approaches and related quench parameters are addressed. Consequences for 
magnet construction are outlined.
Classification scheme. In a simplified classification scheme of magnet-related friction 
scenarios, three different categories are distinguished: (1) magnetic flux motion at small 
externally applied mechanical stresses (e.g., fast flux jumps); (2) zero magnetic field 
tribology, including non-elastic and stick-slip events; and (3) magnet tribology with 
combinations of magnet-induced flux motion, mechanical-stress-induced plastic flow, 
and related jumps and stick-slip phenomena in finite fields.
1. Magnetic flux motion phenomena have been studied at small mechanical forces. At
very small fields in the Meissner state, a superconductor with partially adiabatic 
walls undergoes magneto-caloric coohng. At enhanced fields, flux jump patterns are 
established with associated magneto-thermal heating. During increasing field ramping
and decreasing ramping, nonlinear oscillations are possible.
2. In a zero externally applied magnetic field, the effect of the Earth’s field is negligible for
large structures. Deformations at large forces are encountered in (local) plastic regimes
at large strains. The deformation characteristics in general are nonlinear. Suitable stress

conditions may trigger nonlinear oscillations. Further, stick-slip events are reminiscent 
of serrated yielding observed with Type II superconducting filaments-normal metal 
composite conductors. Plastic flow is favored in “soft” stabilizer material of low yield 
point (e.g., copper). In most composite conductors, there are stabilizer materials (Cu, 
Al) aside from type II filaments (e.g., NbTi), AC barriers, (e.g., Cu-Ni), and electrical 
insulation (e.g., Kapton). As a result of the plastic flow of copper, one portion of the 
system is highly mobile, whereas the Type II material is locally stressed. This leads 
to serrated yielding (e.g., Refs. [18],[25],[44].)
3. In magnet tribology, the general stress situation involves superpositions of field effects 
and friction forces. There is a finite probability of magnetic hoop stress effects, plastic 
deformation, and field-related property changes. Reference [18] provides an example 
of quench domain phenomena. Cyclic loading-unloading sequences (“training”) may 
raise the quench limits of a magnet.
Small-scale versus large-scale magnets. In small laboratory magnets and in low-field, 
moderate size windings (e.g., MRI type systems), epoxy-potted coils and similar tech­
niques have been employed for mechanical stability of windings. Epoxy cracking may 
be encountered upon excessive stress accumulation. Suitable filler-epoxy combinations 
have been developed to avoid quenches. Examples of epoxy phenomena are given in 
Refs. [30-32].
In large magnets with large forces, winding displacement is accompanied by dy­
namic friction events. Therefore, simple tribology models have aimed at parameters 
delineating characteristic “critical” quantities associated with a quench. Examples of 
parameters related to quenches and magnet tribology are the minimum quench energy 
(MQE) and energy density, respectively, the minimum propagating zone (MPZ), and the 
maximum adiabatic zone (MAZ).
The models considered are based on investigators of the UCLA Cryolab (e.g., Refs. 
[19],[22],[26], and [27]). The characteristic parameter MPZ and quench consequences 
have been discussed in detail by Wilson [29]; compare also [40],[41]. The minimum 
propagating zone is written as
MPZ = [A/l}[2k(Tc - T^/p^ 
(2-4)
where k is thermal conductivity, pe| is normal state electrical resistivity, 1 is electrical 
current, A is cross section for the current, and 1 /A is current density. As the thermal 
conductivity (k) is a function of temperature, the MPZ is temperature dependent. For a 
composite low-Tc superconductor, MPZ may reach the order of magnitude of 1 cm.
Maximum adiabatic zone [MAZ], The MAZ represents the dynamic friction-related 
distance at which the tribology-caused dissipation leads to a temperature rise to the su­
perconducting phase boundary. The MAZ may be significantly shorter than the MPZ 
of a composite conductor. This indicates the sensitivity of low-Tc superconductors 
to tribology disturbances. The characteristic length MAZ is large when the T-span 
from the magnet operation temperature to the superconducting transition temperature 
is large. The associated enthalpy change of the adiabatic composite conductor has been 
considered for low-Tc superconductors (i.e., a composite of NbTi-Cu [19], [27]). The 

PROPERTIES OF CRYOGENIC MATERIALS 85
enthalpy differential increment per unit volume is (pcp)dT (specific heat per unit 
volume = product of the density p and the specific heat cp at constant pressure). For 
the composite conductor, various contributions to the thermal energy are summed up, 
noting dominant Debye TMaw contributions for low-T^ systems.
The friction model [26,27] in a winding system has presumed an external force with 
a norma! and tangential field-induced force component. This is expressed parametrically 
by a load factor based on the magnetic pressure APni = £2/(2/zo); B induction; /zq ~ 
1.256 x 10-6 HAn. For M AZ evaluation, the enthalpy difference A//, up to the transition 
temperature Tc, is equal to the frictional energy dissipation. For a conductor of square 
cross section (a-), the MAZ condition has been expressed per volume (V). The simplified 
form of this equation is written parametrically in terms of a load factor (LF) [19] as 
follows:
AZ//V = (LF) AVMAZ/a 
(2-5)
In a related model, a body sliding on an inclined plate has been considered an analog 
case of the single magnet section “seeing” the external field [27].
In general, the friction coefficient varies with temperature. In fast events, the sliding 
details of dynamic friction during adiabatic dissipation depend on the temperature vari­
ation of the friction coefficient. In this area, detailed tribology calculations have been 
presented by Maksimov [28]. There are two classes of slide responses, depending on a 
positive (dp./dT) or a negative value (d^/dT). In addition, a relaxation of the adia­
batic condition alters the results of the tribology modeling. Heat removal increases the 
tolerated displacements beyond the MAZ values of the adiabatic case.
For illustration, Fig. 2-13 displays some MAZ functions based on the tribology 
model versions of Refs. [19] and [22]. It is seen that the “conventional” friction 
coefficients of the preceding figures lead to rather small MAZ values tolerated prior 
to a quench. They are on the order of magnitude of 0.1 mm. A substantial reduction to 
/z = 0.05 improves the displacement (MAZ) margin, provided T is not too close to Tc.
Minimum quench energy [MQE], Once a minimum quench domain of minimum 
length (MPZ) has been created, there is a minimum quench energy associated with the 
MPZ. The order of magnitude of the MQE is assessed: the zone is in the normal state 
acting as “critical nucleus domain.” The related excess temperature of this normal zone 
extends beyond Tc. A simple zone model is based on a Gaussian bell function:
AT = ATmasexp(-42) 
(2-6)
The dimensionless distance is £ = x/MPZ, where x is the axial position coordinate of 
a composite conductor with adiabatic outer boundary and with fluid contact at T = 7^ 
at large a far from the MPZ. The maximum excess temperature ATmax is on the order of 
magnitude (OOM) of Tc, noting the superconductor operating rule of thumb of (Tc/2). 
Thus, we have ATmax = OOMTC. The definite integral of Eq. (2-4) (i.e., of f(x)dx. 
from very large negative to very large positive values) has the value orI/2(MPZ) = 
OOM(MPZ). Using this result, the order of magnitude of the minimum quench energy 
is determined by
MQE = OOM[(MPZ)A](pcp)Tc
(2-7)

86 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING

(load factor-0.1, B = 5 T; from Refs [19] and (22]).
The related energy density is MQE/V\ where the volume is V — A (MPZ). For low-Tc 
materials without significant magnetic moment contributions, we note the low-T molar 
specific heat (Debye function)
cm = 233.iR{T/e^ 
(2-8)
(233.8/? = 1944 kJ/(kmol • K) and kl/(kg-atom • K), respectively; R is the universal gas 
constant. For example, if Debye temperature ©d = 350 K and T = 7 K, cm = 0.015 
SI units. For a molar-atomic volume of OOM 10, the volumetric specific heat has the
OOM of 1.5 mJ/(cc K).
At room temperature, the results are as follows: Dulong-Petit value of the lattice 
specific heat of 3/? equals approximately 25 J/mol - K, and for the same molar volume, 
(pcp) — OOM 2.5 J/(cc K). This is three orders above the low-rc MQE density value.
For high-Tc superconductors, operated at relatively low T, the rare-earth magnetic 
moment contribution raises the volumetric specific heat in comparison with low Tc. As 
T is raised, the enhanced lattice specific heat increases the volumetric specific heat to the 
order of magnitude of 0.01 J/(cc K). Thus, there is a possibility of magnetic contributions 

PROPERTIES OF CRYOGENIC MATERIALS 87
to the specific heat when T is not too high. For elevated temperatures (e.g., 1/10 of 
the Debye temperature) the lattice contributions rise rapidly. This removes the low-Tc 
sensitivity of the example above (Fig. 2-13).
For Tc = OOM 10 K, the MQE per volume is in the OOM range of 0.015 J/cc. At 
Tc = 100 K, the volumetric MQE rises to the OOM of 0.1 to 1 J/cc. The MQE values 
are compared with the tribology-related energy density.
The tribology-induced volumetric energy dissipation is assessed on the basis of (lo­
cal) deformation beyond the 0.2% limit. As cyclic loading and unloading are conducted, 
a hysteresis loop is covered (see Ref. [ 18]). The order of magnitude of the plastic defor­
mation is 0.005 or 0,5% strain. The related stress level is presumed to be on the order of 
magnitude of 500 N/mm2. The resulting energy per volume has the order of magnitude 
of 2.5 J/cc. This value of the dissipated energy density is quite high in comparison with 
MPZ-related magnet tolerances. Thus, absolute dissipation levels have to be kept small 
by appropriate magnet construction.
Further, the order of magnitude comparison suggests that there is an advantage to 
using means available of moving away from the liquid helium boiling point. The two 
alternate routes are low-T^ with relatively high Tc (Nb.iSn) or high-Tc, or hybrid low- 
Tc/high-Tc. Technological improvements in this direction increase the robustness with 
respect to friction events.
Consequences for magnet construction. The small magnet and low-field magnet with 
epoxy potting have been replaced in laboratory experiments by other media. For instance, 
small pancake windings have been clamped by wax [33]. Upon warm-up, a modification 
is possible just by remelting the wax.
Large magnets require detailed attention to tribology of sliding conditions because
static friction cannot be maintained in general. In view of the large forces, nearly all 
friction investigators have addressed dynamic friction coefficient measurements.
Thus, a dual approach of constraining windings and using low-friction materials 
is an option. In this regard, Fig. 2-14 presents clamping approaches schematically.

displacements; (b) clamping against tangential displacements.

Figure 2-14(a) depicts prevention of winding motion in axial direction via geometry 
constraints. Figure 2-14(b) is another possibility using pin-like constraints imposed 
on the windings. Approaches to problems of this nature are noted in several areas. Ex­
amples arc high-pressure vessels wrapped as metal or polymer-fiber-reinforced vessels 
in chemical processing industries and in aerospace. Further, we have closely related 
winding-system applied technology in the large-scale generator and motor systems of 
the electrical power industry.
Summarizing remarks, including polymer aspects. It has been found that undesired 
sudden conductor movement in a winding system is detrimental to stability. In fact, 
there is an enormously high probability of quench occurrence (e.g., Refs. [34,35]). Aside 
from the special geometry-enforced stabilization, the option of preload room temper­
ature treatment has been proposed [36]. Despite careful, very tight clamping in sup­
port structures, coils have suffered premature quenches [37]. These and other phe­
nomena underline the importance of tribology as one contributing factor out of a set 
of several others. Jelly-roll windings have been popular, but they turned out to be 
disturbance-sensitive initially in research and development work. This point has been
retested [38], after work approximately 20 years ago, using modern SSC-composite
conductors. The test data are interpreted as evidence for conductor motion leadin
to
premature quenches.
Thus, in comparison with early low-Tc “hard” superconductor magneto-mechanics
[44], the tribology progress and high-Tc developments encourage continued improve­
ments in the direction of robust magnets. For additional information, Refs. [40] and 
[41] present numerous details of superconducting magnet issues.
Various polymer results from low temperature to room temperature are summarized 
in Tables 2-1 and 2-2. Table 2-1 presents a brief overview of low-T results. Table 2-2

2-2-1 Introduction
Composite advantages. Engineered composite structures have an important role to 
play in the rapidly expanding cryogenics world For some low-temperature applications, 
composite materials can meet stringent requirements that metallic materials cannot For 
other cryogenic applications composite technology offers improved performance and 
lower life-cycle costs
Advantages of composites include low thermal conductivity, high strength and stiff­
ness, light weight, temperature capability to 1 8 K, tailored structural efficiency, dimen­
sional stability, close tolerances improved insulation, corrosion resistance, minimum 
flaw propagation, and low vibration Perceived disadvantages are lack of a standard 
composite material database, cost of some materials, complex design parameters, and
manufacturin
processes that must be carefully controlled

cations are discussed Background information is available elsewhere Kasen [1] most

5310 MPa (54%) for E-Glass and 827^ MPa (80%) for S-Glass [8]
E-Glass is the lowest-cost fiber followed by S-Glass and then medium strength-low 
modulus carbon and Kevlar-49 The medium strength and extremely high modulus car­
bon and alumina fibers are the most expensive The other caibon fibers aie intermediate 
in price
Resins. The resin matrix binds the fibers in their proper position, distributes the load 
between the fibers, protects them from abrasion and environment, provides the interlam­
inar shear strength, and controls the chemical resistance properties Even though the 
elongation to failure of most cured epoxies is relatively low they provide an unbeatable 
combination of cryogenic performance, structural excellence, piocessabihty, and cost 
[11] In addition, epoxies arc generally superior to polyesters in resisting moisture and 
other environmental influences [8] Typical properties of thermoset resins are presented 
in Table 2-4 Tensile strength and most other mechanical properties increase at low 
temperatures [15]
Laminates. Cryogenic composites are typically fabricated by wet winding continuous 
fibers embedded in resin winding prepreg tape or low, laying up or forming woven fabric 
or other prepregs or injection molding thermoplastic resins containing discontinuous 
fibers The fiber placement is followed by some type of tcmpciature or pressure cure 
process, or both Resulting mechanical properties for representative materials are listed 
m Tables 2 5 and 2 6
Cooling generally improves mechanical performance, but detailed data are lim­
ited The strength of G 10CR increases ^100% and the modulus increases ^30% from 
76 to 4 K [ 1 ] From 295 to 20 K compressive strength is reported to increase 55% for S- 
Glass composite 27% for Kevlar-49 composite, and 33% lor carbon composite whereas 
modulus increases 16% for S-Glass composite and 32% for Kevlar-49 composite [20] 
In general filament-wound composite material stiength incicases al least 30%, and 
modulus increases at least 10% from 295 to 76 K [ 19]

Composites reinforced with discontinuous fibers, like Ultem 2100, have lower me­
chanical properties than those with continuous fibers but also lower thermal conductivity, 
as shown in Fig. 2-15. Of the continuous fiber-epoxy materials, glass and alumina offer 
the lowest thermal conductivity above 76 K and so are often the materials of choice for

applications involving ambient to cryogenic temperatures. However, below 76 K, carbon 
and alumina offer low thermal conductance.
There are four basic fatigue failure mechanisms of composites: layer cracking, de­
lamination, fiber breakage, and fiber-matrix debonding. Fatigue strength involves many 
variables, including the basic materials, fiber orientation, composite quality, testing 
parameters, and test specimen configuration. Thus, Fig. 2-16 shows relative fatigue per­
formance of unidirectional reinforced composites assuming all other variables are the 
same. In general, higher modulus fibers provide the best fatigue strength. The fatigue 
endurance limits of Kevlar-49 and carbon composites approach 60% of their ultimate ten­
sile strengths [8], Fatigue performance improves at cryogenic temperatures as indicated 
by the S-Glass-epoxy data in Fig. 2-16.
Composite structures have low vibration susceptibility because of their high struc­
tural dampening properties. They generally do not exhibit creeping tendencies [14], and 
they have good radiation resistance at ambient and cryogenic temperatures [2].
Comparison with metals. Considerations in selecting a cryogenic material include 
tension, compression, flexural, shear, and torsion loads; fatigue, deflection, and vibration 
requirements; creep; temperature gradient; weight allowance; installation geometry; and, 
of course, cost trade-offs. Composites can often be the material of choice.
One approach to comparing composites and metals is to ratio critical values. For 
example, a low ratio of thermal conductivity to modulus or strength can improve sys­
tem performance and reduce costs when structural components are subjected to 
temperature gradients. Composite materials have the advantage. For another example,

high ratios of modulus or strength to density reduce weight and thus loads on equipment. 
Lowest-cost unidirectional E-Glass composites have an equivalent modulus/density 
ratio to steel or aluminum, but for strength/density the ratio is twice that of steel 
and five times that of aluminum Unidirectional carbon composites provide specific
tensile strengths that are three to eight times greater and specific moduli that are four to 
eight times
reater than for steel or aluminum
Even quasnsotropic continuous carbon
fiber composites have specific strengths and moduli higher than steel or aluminum
2-2-3 Structural Design
Design approach. The design of composite structures is essentially the same as for 
metals except that the material must be designed along with the structure The material 
consists of hundreds of thousands of continuous fibers that are precisely oriented in 
patterns to provide strength, stiffness, and other properties in exactly the amount and

direction needed Material design parameters include fiber and matrix selection, fiber 
direction, fiber content, and fabrication process Structure design consists of determining 
thickness, detailing exact configuration, and meeting performance requirements
One of the composite designer’s most difficult tasks is getting someone to accurately
define the directions and magnitudes of all system structural and thermal loadin re­
quirements on the composite structure Composites are anisotropic, exhibiting different
properties alon
different axes Strength, stiffness, thermal expansion, and other proper­
ties can vary by more than ten times in different directions This allows highly efficient 
structures but also possibly failed structures if requirements are not adequately defined
Minimum possible cost is almost always a very important design consideration
In addition to material and process costs, this involves designing for least complex

structure, minimum part count, integral fittings, loosest possible tolerances, greatest 
reproducibility, and lowest life-cycle costs.
Design configuration. The configuration of a composite structure should be designed to 
maximize the advantages of composite materials, not simply to replace the configuration 
of a metal structure. Typical composite shapes arc panels, cylinders, ducts, tubes, struts, 
cones, straps, rings, and shells. Possible configurations are limited only by the mandrel 
or mold used for fabrication. A filament winding mandrel can be any shape that does 
not have a reentrant curve. Injection molding cavities cannot have undercuts that keep 
the finished structure from being removed.
2-2-4 Composite Structure Uses
Fuel tanks. For a 33% weight savings, McDonnell Douglas is using medium strength­
medium modulus carbon-epoxy instead of aluminum for the liquid hydrogen tanks on 
reusable launch vehicles [25]. The cylindrical tanks are 0.5-cm thick, 2.4 m in diameter, 
and 4.9 m high with elliptical end domes. They each hold 2700 kg of fuel. The tanks 
have no liners and no integral reinforcing elements.
Back on Earth, GR-10-type composites are used to support and insulate liquefied 
natural gas (LNG) tanks, both on ships and in storage facilities [I]. Other composite 
materials arc being utilized for support of vacuum-jacketed LNG fuel tanks on trucks, 
buses, and trains.
Support straps. Filament-wound straps are utilized to provide structural support and 
thermal isolation for cryostats and superconducting magnets [26]. They are fabricated 
with glass, alumina, and carbon fibers in epoxy resin to reduce the parasitic heat flow into 
the cryogen Composite straps are found in magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic 
energy storage systems as well as in space on the Space Shuttle, Hubble Spacecraft, 
Infrared Astronomical Satellite, and Cosmic Background Explorer. The straps currently 
range in size from 25 to 965 mm long, 1 to 25 mm wide, 0.31 to 4.39 mm thick, and 3.6 
to 38 mm in pin diameter. The small glass-epoxy straps pictured in Fig. 2-17 support 
the cryogenic bus for the Navy’s high-temperature superconductor experiments.
Nested tubes. Nested tubes allow the use of glass composite between ambient and 76 K
and carbon composite below 76 K to optimize thermal performance. The first reentrant 
posts developed by the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory for superconducting 
dipole magnets had G-10CR nested support tubes. Switching to carbon-epoxy for the 
inner tube, as depicted in Fig. 2-18, reduced the overall thermal conductivity [27]. To 
simplify manufacture, Fermilab then devised two composite tubes connected in series 
along the thermal path of the assembly: glass-cpoxy for 20 to 295 K and carbon-epoxy 
for 4.5 to 30 K. The overlapped composite tubes are captured and held together through 
a shrmk-fit joint configuration [28J.
For the lower load requirements of superconducting quadrupole magnets, Babcock 
& Wilcox developed thermal isolation supports consisting of three Ultem 2300 molded 
post segments connected in series [29].

Anchor tie bars. Fermilab also developed composite anchor tie bars for superconduct­
ing magnets Because metals decrease in length at low temperatures, carbon fiber was 
selected and designed for dimensional stability When cooled from 295 to 4 5 K, the 
305 cm-long-carbon-epo\y structure grows 0.09 cm, whereas its two 15 cm-long-
stainless steel ends shrink 0.045 cm for no net dimensional change [27].

Dewar necktubes and struts. Lockheed Martin has built a large spacecraft dewar that 
is 2 2m in diameter, 3 0-m high, and weighs 842 kg dry The main aluminum tank 
contains 2328 L of He II weighing 338 kg at 1 8 K The aluminum guard tank contains a 
maximum of 99 L of He I at 4 2 K, which is reduced to 30 L prior to launch using heaters 
[30] The main tank is supported by twelve alumina fiber-epoxy struts off the vacuum 
shell The guard tank is supported by the 0 51-mm-thick, 328-mm-diameter, 762-mm- 
long alumina fiber-epoxy necktubc shown in Fig 2-19 It has a 0 03-mm-thick titanium 
foil liner to provide a low-heat-leak, vacuum-tight cylinder connncctmg the main tank 
to the vacuum shell The necktube is reinforced on the outside with 33 alumina-epoxy 
stiffening ribs The alumina fiber is as stiff as low modulus carbon fiber yet has half the 
thermal conductivity of glass below 35 K.
Commercial dewars, which are used mainly for medical and biological specimens, 
utilize low-cost GR-10CR necktubes
Other applications. Other uses for composite structures include components for air­
borne magnetohydrodynamic power generators and magnetic fusion energy systems 
[1] There are new imaging and spectroscopy applications for magnetic resonance 
that require composite materials Compact, rugged, low-cost magnets with optimized 
suspension systems are needed to make broader applications in medicine possible, as well 
as industrial applications in process monitoring and nondestructive evaluation [ 14]. Low- 
thermal-conductivity, high-mechamcal-performancc, lightweight structures are also re­
quired for numerous applications in the energy, electronics, and transportation areas.

R. Flukiger

2-3-1 Intr
uction
The development of superconducting tapes for industrial applications started immedi­
ately after the discovery of the high Tc compounds Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3OiQ (or Bi-2223), with 
Tc = 110 K, and Bi2Sr2CaiCu2O8 (or Bi-2212), with Tc — 92 K, by Maeda et al. [1 ]. 
In the meantime, much progress has been achieved, and the immediate goal of indus­
trial fabrication is the manufacture of long lengths of superconducting tapes for energy 
cables, current limiters, and transformers. Both compounds mentioned above have been 
studied, but the main effort has been concentrated on the compound Bi-2223, which 
shows less sensitivity to magnetic fields at the temperature of liquid nitrogen (77 K).
Substantial progress has been made in the last few years in the understanding of both 
thermal processes and microstructure as well as in the fabrication of long multifilamen- 
tary tapes by means of appropriate deformation steps. The aim of this section is to review 
briefly the recent developments of short and long multifilamentary Bi-2223 tapes with 
high critical current densities because this material is promising for future applications.
2-3-2 Fabrication of Bi-2223 Tapes
Multifilamentary silver (Ag)-sheathed tapes based on lead (Pb)-stabilized Bi-2223 can 
be used in a wide temperature range, which extends from 77 to 4.2 K. The most applied

technique for producin
Ag-sheathed Bi-2223 tapes is the so-called powder-in-tube
(PIT) method [2], The highest reported values of jc (77 K, OT), the critical-current 
densities at 77 K, and zero field for Bi-2223 tapes with lengths >10m are listed in
Table 2-7. (The values of jc are defined for the superconducting cross section.) Strong 
efforts are being undertaken to fabricate tapes in kilometer lengths with critical current
densities comparable to those of short tapes. The goal of these developments is not only 
to enhance the value of critical current density in the superconductin core (jc) but also
the engineering critical-current density (jc) taken over the whole cross section. Actually, 
the content of superconductor is ^25%, but values of 30-35% are envisaged.
At the end of 1996, the highest published value of jc at 77 K, the temperature of 
liquid nitrogen, and at zero magnetic field (0 T) was around 40,000 A/cm2 for long Bi- 
2223 tapes with 85 filaments [6]. For tapes with 37 filaments, a value of 28,500 A/cm2 
over 14.5 m has been reported [8]. Values as high as 55,000 A/cm2 were reported for 
short lengths (<5 cm) of Bi-2223 tapes produced by industrial rolling procedures [2]. It 
can be expected that the highest value reported so far for short pressed Bi-2223 tapes, jc 
(77 K, 0 T) = 69,000 A/cm2 (see Table 2-7) will one day be reached for long industrial 
tapes.
The particular requirements for a sheath material for Bi-2223 or Bi-2212 tapes 
have so far only been satisfied by Ag, which is inert to oxygen as well as to the su­
perconducting oxide and is permeable to oxygen. It is now commonly admitted that 
Ag has no “poisoning” effect on the formation of the bismuth-based superconductors.

Ref [8]).
Nevertheless, the interaction between the Ag from the sheath and the precursor powders 
forming the core of the tape influences the formation of Bi-2223; Ag does not dissolve 
in the Bi-2223 phase but rather in the transient liquid and has thus to be regarded as an 
additional constituent of the complex Bi—Pb—Si^-Ca—Cu—O system [3].
Various powder types can be used for the fabrication of Bi-2223 tapes, but they 
all have a common point: the phase Bi-2223 must be formed by a reaction at the end 
of the tape deformation process [3]. Precursor mixtures of coprecipitated powders of

the order of 5-10 /tm are filled into 6x4 mm (o.d. x i.d.) pure Ag tubes and compacted 
with a piston using a pressure of about 2 kbar. The tubes are properly sealed and then 
deformed by drawing them to an overall diameter of several millimeters after which 
they are drawn to a hexagonal shape. The hexagonal rods are bundled together and 
stacked into a Ag tube, which is deformed to final tape thicknesses of 200-250 [.im, the 
width varying between 2.5 and 4 mm. A cross section of a multifilamentary tape after 
the deformation process is shown in Fig. 2-20. Particular attention has to be given to 
the deformation procedure to prevent cracks perpendicular to the longitudinal direction, 
which cause irreversible damage to the critical-current density.
Recently, a new deformation technique for multifilamentary tapes was introduced 
based on a motor-driven four-roll machine that permits the simultaneous reduction of 
thickness and width of the samples [10]. It was found that the rolling force on the tape 
is also more homogeneous than when using a conventional two-roll machine. Square 
monofilamentary wires of about 1- to 1.5-mm width were prepared by using the four- 
roll machine, the final dimensions being the same as for the usual tapes (i.e., 250-/zm 
thickness and 3-mm width). The reaction conditions were the same in both types of 
Bi-2223 tapes. The advantages of the square symmetry are evident when comparing the 
cross sections of the multifilamentary tapes. In Fig. 2-21, two different cross sections are

shown at an intermediate size of 500 gm x 2.0 mm. The upper cross section represents 
a standard multifilamentary tape with 37 filaments and a superconducting fraction of 
20%. The lower cross section represents a four-rolled tape with 45 filaments and a 
superconducting fraction of about 35%. As shown in Fig. 2-20, the filaments near the 
center in standard tapes are more compressed than those at the sides, whereas the four- 
rolled ones show a homogeneous compression [10]. In addition, the distances between 
the single filaments show much higher fluctuations for the standard tape than for the 
four-rolled tape [10].
Once the final thickness is reached, the tapes have to be submitted to a reaction heat 
treatment, during which the original Bi-2212 phase first transforms to Bi,Pb-2212 and 
then to the final Bi-2223 phase. The empirically determined ideal reaction temperatures 
in air are 830 to 840 °C, the total reaction time being of the order of 200 h. A reduction of 
the oxygen partial pressure leads to a lowering of the reaction temperature to 820-825 °C 
and to shorter reaction times, thus allowing a more economical fabrication. In order to 
reach high critical-current densities, the reaction heat treatment has to be combined with 
one or more intermediate rolling steps. This thermomechanical treatment enhances the 
density inside the oxide core, thus creating the appropriate conditions for a large number 
of current-carrying grain boundaries.
The choice of the appropriate heat treatment and deformation parameters has a 
strong effect on the value of jc. In air, a strong correlation between the value of jc 
and the reaction temperature has been found [9]. In Fig. 2-22, the variation of jc

(77 K, 0 T) as a function of the reaction temperature for 200-h long heat treatments on 
rolled monofilamentary Bi,Pb(2223) tapes exhibits a sharp maximum. The value of jc is 
lowered by 50% for reaction temperature differences as small as 1-2 °C. This effect can 
cause serious problems when reacting long tapes, a very high temperature homogeneity 
(AT < 1 °C) being required over the whole furnace volume to achieve high jc values 
reproducibly. It was found that the maximum shown in Fig. 2-22 is less marked when 
reacting in an atmosphere with reduced oxygen partial pressure, This explains why 
many manufacturers carry out their reactions in an atmosphere containing 7% oxygen, 
which has the additional advantage of a shorter reaction time.
At the end of the deformation process by cold rolling, the Bi-2212 grains in the 
unreacted tapes are already clearly oriented in the tape plane. A correlation was found 
between the texture in the Bi-2212 grains after rolling and the texture of the current­
carrying Bi-2223 grains after reaction in monofilamentary as well as in monofilamentary 
tapes. The high degree of texturing of the Bi-2212 platelets after deformation is thus a 
necessary condition for high values.
The rolling process between subsequent deformation heat treatments is strongly de­
pendent on the forces acting during deformation. It has been shown [9] that on short tape 
lengths, the uniaxial pressure can be enhanced without damage up to 2 GPa, whereas for 
industrial tape lengths the deformation by rolling shows a sharp maximum at 0.6 GPa 
(see Fig. 2-23). This difference is easily explained by the fact that the rolling process 
induces a gliding of the grains, thus favoring the formation of cracks perpendicular to 
the tape length.

2-3-3 Variation of jc (B) for Multifilamentary Bi-2223 Tapes
Critical-current densities at T = 77 K. The variation of jc as a function of applied field 
for a multifilamentary Bi-2223 tape with jc (77 K, 0 T) = 28,000 A/cm2 is represented 
in Fig. 2-24. The critical current density was measured over a total length of 14.5 m [8], 
the thickness was 200 /tm, the width 3.5 mm, the superconducting cross section 20%, 
and the critical current Ic = 37 A. It is seen in Fig. 2-24 that the critical-current density 
decreases much more slowly when the magnetic fields are applied parallel to the surface 
(B/jY At IT, the value of jc is 10,000 A/cm
*',
 which corresponds to an engineering 
value of JQ = 6200 A/cm2, The value at 77 K and a field of 1 T can be considered as 
a reference for the quality of the tape: the values lc (0)//c (0.5 T) = 3.8 and /c (0 T)/ 
/c (1 T) as 3 in Fig. 2-24 are the lowest reported so far [6,8]. Figure 2-24 illustrates the 
anisotropy of the critical-current density in Bi-2223 tapes, the decrease of jc versus B 
being very rapid when the field is applied perpendicularly to the tape surface for 
the current falls to negligibly small values above B ~ 0.5 T.
As a consequence of the marked anisotropy of jc, it follows that at 77 Kall field com­
ponents Bj_ perpendicular to the tape surface have to be avoided. These perpendicular 
field components will limit the achievable magnetic field in a solenoid to 0.6-O.8 T at 
77 K. If one takes into account that the field requirement for energy storage rings is of 
the order of 4-5 T, it is clear that it cannot be satisfied by the actual Bi-2223 material. 
On the other hand, this material is still envisaged for energy cables, transformers, and 
current limiters at 77 K, provided that the AC losses can be kept at a sufficiently low 
level. It follows that the reduction of the critical current anisotropy is one of the main 
goals of future developments of Bi-2223 tapes.
Critical current densities at intermediate temperatures (20-40 K). The critical cur­
rent anisotropy can be strongly reduced when lowering the operating temperature to 
values of the order of 20-40 K. A further advantage is the simultaneously observed 
gradual enhancement of jc with decreasing temperatures: The maximum value is ob­
tained at 4.2 K, where the values of jc are a factor ^6 higher than the values of jc at 
77K. Temperatures below 77 K can be produced by Gifford-McMahon cryocoolers, 
and the construction of prototype magnets producing fields of the order of 10 T in this

temperature range is actually under study in various companies. Nevertheless, economic 
arguments are still in favor of 77 K as an operating temperature.
Critical current densities at 4.2 K. The slow variation of jc versus B for rolled 
Bi-2223 tapes at 4.2 K is of particular interest in view of their application for very high 
field magnets at temperatures ranging between 4.2 and 27 K, the boiling temperatures 
of helium and neon, respectively. Compounds Bi-2212 and Bi-2223 can be used at 
4.2 K as an operating temperature, but Bi-2223 is mainly chosen. The variation of 
jc versus B^, the magnetic field applied parallel to the tape surface, for the same 
rolled tape as above with jc (77 K, 0T) = 28,000 A/cm2 is shown in Fig. 2-25 up to 
B = 15 T [3], The critical-current density values at 4.2 K in Fig. 2-25 are of the order 
of 220,000 A/cm2 and 75-80,000 A/cm2 at 0 and 14 T, respectively, the ratio /c (0 T)/ 
/c (14 T) being %2.5-2.7. The low anisotropy of Jc at 4.2 K can be illustrated by the low 
ratio jc {BH}/jc (B±) 
1.4-1.5 at B = 14 T.
It is interesting to compare these values with those of classical superconductors. 
From the behavior in Fig. 2-25, critical current density values of >75,000 A/cm2 can 
be extrapolated for B 20 T. Taking into account a superconducting cross section of 
20-25%, this corresponds to an “overall” value of 15,000-18,000 A/cm2. The classical 
systems NbjSn, Nb^Al, and PbMofiSg are known to exhibit values of 20,000 A/cm2 at 
20 T but at a lower temperature, 2 K. At higher fields, however, the value for Bi-2223 
remains quite constant, whereas the value for the classical systems decreases rapidly. 
Since the actual critical-current densities for long, rolled Bi-2223 tapes are a factor 2 
below the highest reported ones on pressed tapes, it follows that without any doubt, 
Bi-2223 is an adequate material for the fabrication of very high field magnets at the 
operating temperature of 4.2 K.
Recently, a hybrid magnet of 40-mm diameter producing 1.5 T in a background field 
of 22.5 T was successfully tested in Japan, thus establishing the record value of 24T at 
4.2 K. From a comparison with the data plotted in Fig. 2-25, it follows that even higher 
fields can be produced using Bi-2223 tapes. It is noteworthy that the main problem 
arising when producing very high field magnets based on Bi,Pb(2223) tapes is not the 
critical current density but the mechanical strength necessary to withstand the important 
Lorentz forces at high fields. By alloying magnesium to the silver sheath, the mechanical 
properties of the tapes have been enhanced in the last years [11,18]. It is expected that the 

110 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
construction of high-field magnets will be one of the first industrial application on a large 
scale for HTC superconductors. From the available data, however, it cannot yet be said 
whether HTC magnets can be operated in the "persistent mode." Alternative solutions 
for high-field NMR have been proposed (e.g., a background field of 20 or 21 T produced 
by a classical NbsSn magnet operated in the “persistent mode,") and an HTC insert coil 
controlled by a high-stability power supply. Such devices are actually planned, but it is 
too early to predict their impact on the market.
Reinforcement of Bi,Pb(2223) tapes by dispersion hardening. It is obvious that the 
problem of mechanical stability of Bi,Pb(2223) tapes has to be solved when envisaging 
magnets producing magnetic fields well above 20 T in a reproducible manner. It is known 
that the irreversible strain in Bi,Pb(2223) tapes is enhanced from 0.2 to 0.6% when going 
from the mono- to the multifilamentary configuration [11,18]. Several mechanismshave 
been proposed, all being based on dispersion hardening of Ag by alloying small quantities 
of other elements (e.g., Mg, Mn, or Sb). The tensile stress of reinforced multifilamentary 
Bi,Pb(2223) tapes increased from 80-100 MPa for pure Ag to 200-250 MPa for the 
dispersion-hardened Ag. The latter value is close to the value for multifilamentary NfySn 
wires, which is encouraging. However, a compromise must always be found between 
hardening of the Ag sheath and low reaction with the Bi,Pb(2223) phase, thus limiting 
the amount of additive to total contents of the order of 1 wt % [11,18].
Enhancement of the matrix resistivity. A second reason for the use of dispersion- 
hardened Ag is the very low electrical resistivity of the latter, which leads to high AC 
losses—a serious obstacle on the way to industrial applications (e.g., cables, transform­
ers, current limiters, or motors). The problem is due to the fact that all alloyed elements 
mentioned above oxidize during the reaction heat treatment, either in air or in a 7% 
oxygen atmosphere. This leads in all cases to a “cleanin
effect," the content of the
additives in Ag being lowered, thus causing a lower electrical resistivity of Ag, which 
in turn causes higher AC losses. At present, the enhancement of the electrical resistivity 
of Ag at 77 K between neighboring filaments as a consequence of dispersion hardening 
has not exceeded a factor 2-3, which is insufficient. The only exception, Gold, has to 
be excluded for economic reasons. Another possibility to reduce AC losses is to twist
the filaments, the twist pitch being of the order of 10 mm or less. Unfortunately, this 
technique is still unsatisfactory due to “bridging" between neighboring filaments. In 
our laboratory, a promising new technique has been introduced very recently [19] con-
of surrounding each filament in a multifilamentary tape by an “oxide barrier.”
This thin barrier consists of BaZrO3, which leads to considerably enhanced electrical 
resistivities between the filaments and does not react with the superconducting core. 
Actually, this new “oxide barrier” technique has already been proven to lower the AC 
losses in multifilamentary Bi-2223 tapes [19], and major efforts are being placed on 
further development.
2-3-4 Conclusion
The highest possible critical current densities in industrial multifilamentary Bi-2223 
tapes have not yet been reached, and a dynamic development is expected in the next 
years. The highest reported critical current values known to the author at the end 1996 

PROPERTIES OF CRYOGENIC MATERIALS 111
have been listed in Table 2-7. However, even after having reached the highest short 
tape values [3-7,9] in long tapes, the “overall” or engineering critical-current density 
will not be sufficient for producing magnetic fields higher than 0.6-0.8 T at 77 K. As an 
example, energy storage devices should be operated at 4-5 T, which constitutes a goal 
that will be hard to reach with Bi,Pb(2223) tapes at the present level of development. 
For prototypes, it is actually envisaged to lower the operating temperature to 20-40 K 
by means of cryocoolers.
In view of the high level of technology of Bi-2223 tapes, it is worthwhile to continue 
the search for further enhancement of the current-carrying properties.
The most important reasons for a limitation of the engineering critical-current den­
sity yc are the following;
1. Inhomogeneity of the precursors (composition, size, impurities).
2. Phase diagram and phase formation conditions (reaction heat treatment).
3. Homogeneity of the deformation process (“sausaging”).
4. Microstructure and quality of grain boundaries.
5. Anisotropy of the critical-current density. 
*
It is not the purpose of this section to discuss these points in detail, but it appears that 
all of them need further understanding and more experimental work. The most important 
improvements, however, could be obtained if it would be possible to introduce defects . 
at an atomic level in order to enhance the pinning behavior of the grains and to get jc 
values closer to the values reported in thin films, which are 20 to 50 times higher at , 
77 K (see Table 2-7). A second important requirement is the reduction of the observed 
anisotropy of the critical-current density at 77 K. Proton irradiation experiments have ■ 
already shown that the decrease of jc for Bj_ tape surface can be reduced substantially 
[16]. The question is whether other processes can be found that introduce a partial - 
disorder in the Bi,Pb(2223) structure.
The recent development of the competing Y(123) or R.E.(123) systems by deposi­
tion methods may be another alternative when envisaging industrial applications at the 
operating temperature of the liquid nitrogen [17]. The fabrication of such tapes requires ' 
the use of very sophisticated deposition techniques and yields not only good critical cur­
rent densities at 77 K but also a reduced anisotropy compared with the one of Bi-2223. 
It appears, however, that it will be far more difficult to fabricate long multi filamentary 
tapes using these techniques than by using the powder-in-tube method, which is certainly 
the most economical one for tapes of kilometer lengths.

2-4-1 Introduction
There arc two ways in which magnetic materials are used in devices that refrigerate 
at cryogenic temperatures: (1) as an active substance that produces cooling due to the 
magnetocaloric effect and (2) as a high-heat capacity, passive regenerator material below

15 K. An example of the former is gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) used in a 4-K Carnot 
cycle magnetic refrigerator [ 1 j; an example of the latter is Er^Ni used in the second-stage 
regenerator of a 4-K Gifford-McMahon cryocooler [2].
This section will focus on active refrigerant materials and briefly mention recent 
activity in passive magnetic regenerator materials [3]. Data for typical materials are pre­
sented in tabular and graphical form with references where additional information can 
be found. Note that the references and examples included in this article are not intended 
to be an exhaustive list. The reader is encouraged to check the latest literature because 
important new materials are being added frequently in this rapidly evolving field. This 
section also includes a short glossary of terms commonly used in magnetic refrigera­
tion. More general discussions of terminology, magnetism, and magnetic properties of 
materials can be found in numerous books, including Refs. [4—7}.
Magnetic refrigeration is based on the physics of the magnetocaloric effect. First 
discovered by Weiss and Piccard in 1918 [8], it is the physical process by which some 
magnetic materials experience a temperature change when subjected to a magnetic field 
under adiabatic conditions. Several thermodynamic cycles can be implemented using 
this effect typically involving magnetization and demagnetization processes coupled with 
heat transfer to and from the magnetic material. Magnetic analoges to the standard gas 
compression cycles exist (e.g., Carnot, Brayton, Ericcson) in addition to a unique cycle 
called active magnetic regenerative refrigeration (AMRR). Numerous references are 
available for both the basic physics of the magnetocaloric effect and its implementation 
in various types of magnetic refrigeration cycles [9-14]. We shall restrict ourselves here 
to a brief summary of the important material properties for the engineering designer.
The magnetocaloric effect of a particular magnetic material is a function of applied
field and temperature. The effect increases monotonically with increasing field for most 
materials and has a maximum value at the magnetic phase transition temperature of the 
material. For simple ferromagnetic materials like gadolinium, Che adiabatic temperature 
change (AT
*)
 as a function of temperature is caret-shaped and centered on the Curie tem­
perature of 293 K, as illustrated in Fig. 2-26. The limited width of the temperature profile 
means that the designer must select a material that has a magnetic phase transition near 
the desired refrigeration temperature. For large temperature spans between source and 
sink, this often requires the layering of several materials to obtain adequate refrigeration 
over the span [12,13], Of equal importance is the fact that the magnetocaloric effect is 
only of the order of 1 K per tesla of applied magnetic induction field for the best available 
materials based on rare-earth elements. This motivates the use of high-field supercon­
ducting magnets to provide sufficient heat pumping in most practical applications. The 
desire to provide refrigeration at all temperatures below 25 °C with as small a magnet 
(magnetic field) as possible has driven research into new materials that have a variety of 
transition temperatures and large magnetocaloric effects [15-27],
Additional design considerations arise when these magnetic solids are fabricated 
into porous regenerator geometries and coupled with a circulating fluid to facilitate heat 
transfer with the thermal load and environment. Ductile refrigerants are preferred to 
brittle materials that are difficult to fabricate into the desired form, whether they be 
particles, wire screens, or thin plates. Mechanical strength is a concern because of the 
necessity to withstand the large magnetic forces that can exist between regenerator and

magnet. Finally, eddy current generation in material exposed to time-varying magnetic
fields can be a concern in higher-frequency refrigerators, leading to the use of low-
electrical-conductivity material in highly discrete forms [28].
2-4-2 Classification of Magnetic Refrigerant Materials
The magnetic refrigerants can be grouped into five categories:
1. Rare-earth elements and their solid solution alloys.
2. Intermetallic compounds.
3. Nonmetallic (dielectric) compounds.
4. Amorphous materials and nanocomposites.
5. Exotic materials.
The rare-earth elements form the basis of virtually all practical magnetic refrigerants. 
This is due to their electronic structure in which unpaired electrons in the 4/ orbitals 
generate high intrinsic magnetic moments for the atoms. The rare-earth elements and
intra-rare-earth solid solution alloys tend to be ductile, have a relatively low electrical 
conductivity, and have large values of A7ad- The physical and chemical properties of the 
rare-earths are documented extensively in the multivolume series by Gschneidner and 
Eyring [29].
Rare-earth elements can be combined with other metals to form intermetallic com­
pounds like GdNij and GdPd [15]. These tend to be brittle materials that often have a 
reduced magnetocaloric effect due to the diluting effects of the non-rare-earth element.

PROPERTIES OF CRYOGENIC MATERIALS 1 IS
There are a very large number of such materials, however, some of which offer superior 
performance in certain temperatures ranges [3,15,30].
A variety of nonmetallic elements can be combined with rare-earth elements to 
produce dielectric compounds. Gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG or GdgGasOis) is the 
most common example along with various dysprosium-oxygen-metal compounds [16]. 
These refrigerants have typically been used in their paramagnetic state for refrigeration 
below 20 K. This is in contrast to the rare-earth metals, alloys, and compounds in Cate­
gories 1 and 2 that are usually used at the transition point between paramagnetism and 
an ordered state (e.g., ferromagnetism).
Amorphous and nanocomposite materials based on rare-earth elements are a promis­
ing class of materials in the early stages of development at the time of this writing. 
Amorphous refrigerant materials are typically produced by extremely rapid cooling of 
molten alloy that is composed of a rare-earth metal with one or more alloying elements 
to facilitate glassification [31]. Potential advantages of amorphous materials over their 
crystalline counterparts include easily variable magnetic phase transition temperatures, 
reduced brittleness, and lower electrical conductivity [32]. Nanocomposites are materials 
with nanosized crystalline species dispersed in the matrix. The magnetic properties of 
these materials are currently under investigation [33],
Exotic materials are those magnetic refrigerants that do not fit into the other cate­
gories. A prime example is the iron-rhodium alloy Fe49Rhs j [34]. This material exhibits 
a very large adiabatic temperature change of —8 K at a field of only 2 T.
2-4-3 Representative Magnetic Refrigerant Data
Table 2-8 presents a list of some important magnetic refrigerants sorted by magnetic 
ordering temperature. It includes the peak ATa(j at high field and references for both the 
magnetocaloric effect data and any usage of the material in an experimental refrigeration 
device. Table 2-9 presents some selected property data for the key rare-earth elements, 
including density, room temperature, heat capacity, and yield strength.
Figure 2-26 presents the magnetocaloric effect data as a function of field for gadolin­
ium. Figure 2-27 is a graph of ATad versus temperature at high field for five of the 
materials that have been used experimentally in a prototype refrigerator: Gd, Tb, Dy, 
Gdo.2Hoo8, and GdNia. Figure 2-28 presents A7id versus temperature for GGG at mod­
erate fields. Note that the relatively high value of A 7^ for GGG is partly the result of 
the very low heat capacity of the material below 20 K. This must be taken into account
I

when designing GGG regenerators because of the potential problems associated with its 
low thermal mass compared with other components.
2-4-4 Passive Magnetic Regenerator Materials
Passive magnetic regenerator materials have been developed for use in gas-cycle cryo­
cooler regenerators below 15 K [2,3]. The usefulness comes from magnetic materials 
that have a large zero-field heat capacity near their magnetic phase transition tempera­
tures. Standard low-temperature regenerator materials like lead have a heat capacity that

absorb thermal energy from helium gas in a low-temperature cryocooler Conversely, ma­
terials with magnetic phase transition temperatures below 15 K can retain adequate heat 
capacity for regeneration The key achievement with these materials is the production 
of roughly 1 W of cooling power at 4 K in a Gifford-McMahon cryocooler [35] This

2-5-1 Introduction
Low-temperature applications of polymers are increasing,and data at cryogenic tempera­
tures are required for most designs Mechanical, thermal,dielectric, and gas permeability 
data will be presented and discussed. The physical background of each property will 
be discussed briefly, and a compilation of the data will be given in the Appendix. It 

122 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
will be shown that a study of cryogenic properties helps in the understanding of room 
temperature properties.
For many applications, the resistance of a polymer to environmental effects (e.g., 
moisture or ionizing radiation) is an important design parameter. The limited data avail­
able will be presented.
An important question is the accuracy of the data. The errors from measurements 
usually are small compared with the deviations caused by processing, treatments, or 
insufficiently known polymer configurations or conformations. Therefore, those param­
eters will be considered first before going into details.
2-5-2 Accuracy of Data
Materials data are anything but exact values of universal character. They can be used as a 
guideline for characterizing materials with the same nominal chemical composition and 
structure. For most polymers, the exact composition, production methods, and additives 
are not well known or are a trade secret. Even the crystalline content is not well defined 
or is a matter of thermal treatment and processing. For example, extruded PEEK is rather 
low in crystallization and sensitive to moisture. This is not true for compression-molded 
PEEK, where the cooling rate during processing is small enough to allow a crystallization 
of up to 40 vol %.
Material properties of several polymers are influenced by the environment. Water 
absorbed at high temperatures might influence properties even at cryogenic temperatures 
(see Fig. 2-30), The cooling media might influence the fracture mechanical properties. For 
PE and PC, the critical stress concentration factor (^ic) and the energy release rate (Gic) 
are much higher with nitrogen cooling than in a helium environment at the same temper­
ature. Nitrogen (liquid and gaseous) enhances the formation of crazes at the crack tip.
Most deviations of data originate in a different and not well-defined sample his­
tory. The measuring methods themselves usually allow an accuracy of a few percent to
Figure 2-30 Mechanical loss factor tan 6 and shear modulus G for dry and annealed PEI.

PROPERTIES OF CRYOGENIC MATERIALS 123
be achieved. The errors in measurement in most cases are negligible compared with the 
deviations resulting from production method, sample treatment, or environment. As a 
rule of thumb, the uncertainties of the data presented are about 10 to 15%.
2-5-3 Sample Treatments and Their Influence on Cryogenic Properties
Thermal cycling between 300 and 77 K does not influence the properties of polymers 
more then to 5%. Most of the effects occur during the first ten cycles. Brittle 
polymers, such as PS, show the largest effect since microcracks are induced. Semicrys­
talline and cross-linked polymers are less sensitive. If polymers are bonded to materials 
having different thermal expansions (e.g., fiber composites), properties are much more 
influenced by thermal cycling.
Annealing influences several parameters that may slightly change the properties.
These effects are
• Increase of crystalline content (for semicrystalline polymers)
• Desorbtion of water content
• Relaxation of orientation effects or internal stresses from manufacturing (e.g., extru­
sion) or sample preparation (machinin
Annealing just below the glass transition temperature leads to water desorbtion and 
relaxation. Many polymers such as PC, PS, PMMA, PE, PI, polycyanates, and epoxies 
are less sensitive to moisture, and the effect of annealing is less than 5% for most 
properties. There are, however, polymers such as PEI and PESU whose mechanical 
damping and modulus are influenced by dissolved water molecules. It is astonishing 
that water dissolved at room temperature changes low-temperature properties. At about 
160 to 180 K, a damping peak is induced and certain molecular mobilities are hindered 
by dissolved water molecules. Figure 2-30 compares the damping spectrum and shear 
modulus for dry and annealed PEI. The dry specimen exhibits a “water peak,” and a 
low-temperature peak at 40 K is suppressed. The shear modulus of annealed PEI is 
reduced by 8% below 150 K.
For most of the polymers, thermal expansion is reduced by less than 5% after 
annealing. Fracture properties (e.g., fracture stress and strain) are slightly improved 
by annealing because internal stresses are relaxed. Usually, the data presented apply to

Cryogenic applications of polymers concentrate on superconductivity, fusion technology, 
and hydrogen technology. Electrical and thermal insulation arc major topics. When 
polymers are used for liquid hydrogen storage, their gas permeability is another important 
property At low temperatures, polymers become brittle and sensitive to the formation 
of microcracks, which may increase permeability even at low temperatures.
When superconducting magnets are used in accelerators or fusion reactors, irradi­
ation will be a problem for polymeric components. Most polymers are not resistant to 
radiation. Their mechanical properties degrade at a dose of 10ft to 10R Gy.
Many polymers arc used as matrices in fiber composites [ 1 ]. Their applications in 
cryogenics are of great importance in structural supports, nonmetal lie cryostats, and

 Some cryogenic properties of composites can 
be predicted from the properties of their components. Polymers in composites, however, 
may exhibit a behavior different from that of the bulk material. In Table 2-10, the 
applicability of bulk properties of polymers to composites is compiled.
Inorganic particulate fillers are used to reinforce polymers or reduce their ther­
mal expansion. Polymers filled with very small-sized particles can be used as excellent 
thermal insulating materials. The additional thermal resistance (inverse thermal conduc­
tivity) arises from phonon scattering at the bounderies of particles (Kapitza resistance). 
It increases drastically with decreasing temperature and decreasing particle size. The 
thermal conductivity (e.g, of PI at 2 K) can be lowered by a factor of 50 when filled by 50 
vol % with particles of about 1 /zm in diameter. In addition, this particulate composite 
exhibits a rather high compressive strength (about 600 MPa at 2 K) and thus can be used 
for strong thermal insulating support elements.
For transmission of electromagnetic waves, a material with very low dielectric
damping is required. Lowest loss factors arc achieved with polymers at low temperatures

2-5-5 Scientific Aspects of Low-Temperature Polymer Investigations
There are several scientific aspects to studying cryogenic properties of polymers. At low 
temperatures, the following properties or features can be investigated:
• Basic properties
• Universal low-temperature properties
• Weak van der Waals potential
• Molecular motions of singular segments
• Features of long-wavelength phonons
♦ Tunneling processes
’ Additional details on composite materials may be found in section 2-2 of this chapter.

PROPERTIES OF CRYOGENIC MATERIALS 125
Basic properties. At low temperatures most molecular mobilities are frozen, and poly­
mer properties obey the principles of solid-state physics. These properties are called 
“basic properties” At higher temperatures (>120 K) properties are changed by sec­
ondary and primary glass transitions. Secondary or tertiary transitions refer to those 
occurring in*the
 backbone or the sidegroups, respectively, of a polymer. The properties 
of polymers above about 120 K are determined mainly by glass transitions. The great 
differences in polymer properties are caused by glass transition that occur at different 
temperatures.
Universal low-temperature properties. A striking feature of polymers at low temper­
atures (< 10 K) is that most of their thermal, elastic, and mechanical damping properties 
are rather similar, irrespective of their chemical compositions. Differences, however, ex­
ist between amorphous and semicrystalline polymers and between different crystalline 
contents. Below 10 K several properties approach a narrow band of values:
• tan^c « 10’  for amorphous polymers
3
• Shear modulus G & 2-3 GPa (amorphous)
G « 2.5-4.5 GPa (semicrystalline; 60 vol %)
• Young’s modulus E « 5-8 GPa (amorphous)
E « 7-9 GPa (semicrystalline or cross-linked)
• Specfic heat is rather independent of chemical composition below 80 K.
Amorphous polymers exhibit higher values than semicrystalline ones. There are, 
however, parameters that influence cryogenic properties:
• Thermal conductivity of semicrystalline polymers depends on the size of the crystallites 
(boundary resistance at very low temperatures).
• Dielectric properties depend on the polarity of the monomers and therefore on the 
chemical composition.
Binding potential. It is a feature specific to polymers that different binding forces act 
within a polymer chain (intrachain binding) and between chains (interchain binding).
Intrachain binding is caused by the stron
covalent potential.
Interchain binding is caused by the weak van der Waals potential (for several polymers
the hydrogen bond also contributes).
At low temperatures most properties are determined mainly by the weak interchain
binding (van der Waals). The chains are frozen; deformations are controlled by the inter­
chain potential. Weak van der Waals forces can therefore be studied at low temperatures.
Molecular motions of singular segments. Van der Waals forces indirectly control
molecular mobilities at low temperatues. Most mobilities are due to small rotations
of chain segments or side groups. An example will be
iven for the end monomer
of a polyethylene chain. The CH3 group would be able to rotate freely if there were

monomer. Van der Walls interactions between

dashed lines
no barrier. A barrier arises from van der Waals interactions of neighboring hydrogen 
substitutes, as shown in Fig. 2-31 (dashed lines). These barriers are small and can be 
activated at rather low temperatures.
Rotations within a chain are possible for a collective motion of a segment of 4
to 5 monomers having a common axis. A sketch of the so-called crankshaft motion is 
given in Fig. 2-32. A small barrier against free rotation again arises from van der Waals 
interactions of side substitutes. These interactions increase with the size and polarity 
of side substituents (see section 2-5-7). The crankshaft rotations can be activated at 
140 K. This leads to increased flexibility of chains. These low-temperature processes 
influence properties at higher temperatures. At low temperatures, the mobility of singular 
segments or side groups can be studied separately. At high temperatures many molecular 
mobilities are overlapped.
Features of long-wavelength phonons. At low temperatures (<50 K) only long wave­
length phonons are activated, which propagate in all directions of a polymer. The force 
constant of these vibrations arises.mainly from van der Waals forces. Above 50 K, how­
ever, phonon wavelengths are too small for propagating between polymer chains (mean 
chain distance ~0.4-0.5 nm). Most thermal properties at higher temperatures are there­
fore determined by intrachain phonons. The behavior of long-wavelength phonons can 
only be studied at low temperatures.
Tunneling processes. At very low temperatures (<1 K) most thermal and damping 
properties of amorphous polymers are dominated by tunneling processes (3). The tem­
perature dependencies of specific heat and thermal conductivity are very different from 
those of crystals.

PROPERTIES OF CRYOGENIC MATERIALS 127
2-5-6 Glass Transitions and Properties
Glass transitions influence most of the properties of polymers. However, at low tem­
peratures they are frozen, and the so-called basic properties dominate. Glass transitions 
are characterized by the unfreezing of mobilities of specific molecular segments or side - 
groups. An important mobility is the crankshaft motion shown in Fig. 2-32. Unfreez­
ing (around 140 K) makes the chains more flexible. Side-group motions, such as the 
wagging of neighboring phenylrings of PS, induce small glass transitions at ^40 K. 
Side-group motions, however, do not greatly influence the mechanical properties.
Equilibrium is usually determined by the minimum of the binding potential. Be­
cause of the loose polymer structure, a second neighboring potential minimum exists 
in some cases that is separated by a ba<rier. At a sufficiently high temperature and un­
der load, specific molecular segments are able to surpass this barrier. These statistical 
and thermally activated jumping processes are dissipative and can be characterized by a 
damping maximum that occurs at a temperature Tgs, the glass transition temperature. The 
position of Tgs depends on the frequency or deformation rate of loading. For cryogenic 
properties, only secondary glass transitions are of interest.
Tunneling processes become dominant at very low temperatures at which jumping 
processes are no longer possible [3]. This results from a quantum mechanical process 
that allows the barrier to be penetrated by violation of energy or momentum conservation 
laws over a short distance or period of time (uncertainty principle).
The influences of tunneling and jumping processes on properties are shown in 
Fig 2-33. The broken line symbolizes the basic properties without glass transitions. 
Below 10 K the mechanical and electrical damping behaviors aredominated by tunneling 
processes; the specific heat and thermal conductivity, below 1 K.
For jumping processes, a drop of moduli and an increase in the dielectric permittivity 
are correlated to the glass transition at Tgs and the corresponding damping peak. For 
the mechanical cases, chains become more flexible and moduli drop. For the dielectric 
case, more polar groups become more mobile and better oriented by the electrical field.
Thermal expansion is strongly increased by glass transitions because more free 
volume is created above the transition temperature by mobile segments.
2-5-7 Damping Behavior
Jumping processes of singular molecular segments over the barrier take some time (the 
so-called relaxation time) t(T), which is a function of temperature. Relaxation time 
can be determined from the damping peak specific to this mobility and occurring at the 
transition temperature (Tgs). For the case of sinusoidal loading with an angular frequency 
co, relaxation time holds at the peak:
r (T)a> = 1 
(2-9)
The barrier A<I> controlling the statistical jumping process can be calculated by the 
Arrhenius equation:

tions of PE, for example, A<t> ~ 40kJ/moi. The damping behavior is usually expressed 
as a loss factor (tan 5), which can be detected by several methods as follows:
Mechanical damping. The mechanical loss factor can be determined from hysteresis 
effects (forced oscillations) or the logarithmic decrement A of damped free vibrations 
(torsion pendulum): tan <5 = A/tt. Several examples of damping spectra are shown in 
Fig, 2-34. The damping peaks are shifted to higher temperatures for side substitutes 
with higher polarities and larger sizes. The largest barrier for place changes occurs 
for chloride side substituents in this presentation (e.g for PVC). It already has been 
mentioned that at about 4 K. The mechanical loss factor of most amorphous polymers 
(tan % 10"3) is independent of the chemical composition. Semicrystalline polymers 
(e.g., HDPE) exhibit lower values because damping occurs only for the amorphous 
phase.
Dielectric damping. Damping can also be activated by an oscillating electrical field. 
The dielectric loss factor tan <SC of amorphous polymers depends strongly on the polarity 
of mobile monomers or segments. There exists an interesting correlation between the

2-5-8 Deformation Behavior
External forces cause both fast deformations of electron orbitals and slow deforma­
tions (change of places) of molecular segments. For polymers, mainly three types of 
deformations are fundamental:
• Elastic deformations at very low temperatures or extremely high deformation rates. 
They are reversible, nondissipative, and independent of temperature and time (de­
formation rate). The forces are controlled by fast deformations of electron orbitals. 
Mainly weak van der Waals binding forces are involved, which are responsible for the 
low moduli of elasticity.
• Viscoelastic deformations in the region of a glass transition. They are reversible, 
dissipative, and dependent on temperature and time. Their response results from time­
consuming changes of place of molecular segments or side groups, This deformation 
is linear for small loads only.
• Viscous deformations at higher temperatures or high loads. They are irreversible, dis­
sipative, and time-and temperature-dependent. Their response results from molecular
slipping while surpassin
several potential barriers.
The deformation behavior of polymers is usually described by a combination of 
elastic springs F and damping elements rf. An example is given in Fig. 2-36. At very 
low temperatures, the damping elements are frozen, and the elastic spring Fq remains; 
the polymers become linear elastic.
Tensile moduli. Depending on the type of loading, different moduli are defined to
describe deformation behavior as follows:

The creep modulus E(T, z) (defined by a strain step) is nearly the inverse relaxation 
compliance at low temperature. The latter is easier to measure.
The relaxation compliance E(T, r) can be determined by applying a load step ct0 
and waiting for the strain to reach a constant (relaxed) state. The time-dependence of F 
is given by [5]:

where Eu is the start compliance, which is assumed to be unrelaxed and r is the time 
constant defined by (Fu - FR) being reduced by the factor 1 /e. If several relaxation 
processes are involved, a summation has to be performed. In Fig. 2-37 the creep compli­
ance F is plotted versus time for several polymers at 77 K. When plotting the curves of 
Fig. 2-37 in a log-log scale, straight lines result. The slope m chracterizes the relaxation 
or creep behavior. It holds for the complience F or the modulus E as follows:

The initial modulus E (Young’s modulus) is determined from stress-strain dia­
grams. A schematic presentation is given in Fig. 2-38 for diagrams at different 
temperatures and deformation rates (e.g., strain rate e). At very low temperatures, a 
linear elastic relation exists without any dependence on e. The largest dependence on s 
as well as hysteresis effects exist in the region of a glass transition. At higher tempera­
tures, irreversible deformations are overlapped.
The complex modulus E*  is usually applied under sine-wave loading, where hys­
teresis effects and phase shifts (6) occur. In Fig. 2-39 the real and imaginary components 
arc defined in a vector diagram. The absolute value Eq is determined by the maximum 
values of stress ctq and strain eq of a sine-wave loading: £D(cu, T) ~ oq/cq- At low 
temperatures, damping and hysteresis effects are small and E" is negligible. Then the 
complex modulus Eq and the storage modulus E' are approximately equal to the Young’s
modulus. At the same time scale of loading,

Figure 2-41 Poisson's ratio versus temperature.
Permittivity has a time- and temperature-independent component that arises from elec­
tron polarization. This component dominates at very low temperatures or very high 
frequencies. The magnitude of the cryogenic permittivity is ec % 2, There is a slow 
component overlap arising from polar groups that are somewhat oriented by a low- 
frequency electrical field. This component is called orientation polarization and depends 
on the time (frequency) and temperature, At low frequencies or high temperatures, per­
mittivity of polymers can reach ~ 5 (e.g., for PVC).
There exists a great similarity between the permittivity and the mechanical compli­
ance F' (inverse modulus). Like the permittivity, there is a fast electronic component 
for the compliance that is time- and temperature-independent. It is the elastic component 
arising from electron deformations. At a glass transition, chain segments become flex­
ible, and F' increases. This is the slow viscoelastic component. Figure 2-42 illustrates 
the analogous behavior of Fl and s'.

2-5-10 Fracture Behavior
From a microscopic point of view, it is astonishing that isotropic polymers exhibit a 
poor fracture behavior. Despite the fact that polymer chains are extremely strong (up to 
15 GPa), entangled isotropic polymers exhibit a tensile strength in the range of 30- 
200 MPa only. The upper value applies to low temperatures (4K). The observed low 
strength is due to inhomogeneities, internal stress, stress concentrations at microcracks, 
and surface cracks.
Isotropic polymers have high compressive strength, low shear strength, and interme­
diate tensile strength. By contrast, in aligned pol>%iers, the high strength of the chains 
is concentrated in the alignment direction, and the tensile strength becomes rather high. 
Kevlar fibers, which are aligned aramid molecules, have a tensile strength of ^2 GPa.
At very low temperatures, isotropic polymers are brittle but have a higher fracture 
strength than at warmer temperatures. The reason is a higher binding strength due to the 
more compact packing that results from thermal contraction. At higher temperatures 
several processes are induced by loading, which counteracts brittleformation—especially 
for thermoplastic polymers. The main processes are yielding, necking, and the formation 
of crazes. These processes, however, increase mainly the fracture strain. Cross-linked 
polymers, such as epoxy resins do not exhibit these processes, and they have a low frac­
ture strain even at higher temperatures. Several thermoplastics (PC, PMMA, PESU, PS) 
tend to form crazes at a crack tip that resist crack propagation. Perpendicular to the crack 
direction, fibrils are pulled out of the bulk material [6J. The fibrils are mechanically 
strong. A schematic of this situation is shown in Fig. 2-43.
Stress intensity factor. Stress concentrations in the vicinity of crack tips can be de­
scribed by stress intensity factors (K) which depend on the mode of loading. The ex­
pression K[ represents tensile loads, Aji and Kni represent shear loads, and is the 
' critical value that characterizes the onset of crack propagation. Figure 2-44 shows a 
specimen for the measuring of K|C, which is a function of the critical stress required to 
fracture ac,the crack length u, the temperature T, the deformation rate 5, and a factor Y 
that describes the sample geometry (for a rectangular compact tension specimen Y = 
(2tt)^2). Linear elastic fracture mechanics yields [7]
K\e(T, S') = ac(T,S)ao sY

crack propagation. (P is the force and £ the crack

At low temperatures Aqc ranges from 2 to 10 MPa m1/2. It is not very sensitive to 
deformation rate.
Energy release rate. Although the stress intensity factor describes the crack initation, 
the energy release rate Gj describes the crack propagation. When a load is applied, elastic 
energy is stored in the specimen. During crack propagation, this energy is consumed by 
chain scissions, plasticization of the crack tip, and acceleration of the crack propagation. 
The critical value is defined by
(2-18)
Gk(7',<S) = ——^[J/m2] 
AA
where A £cj is the released energy and A A is the area created by the crack. The expression 
Gjc is also a function of temperature and deformation rate. It can be determined by a 
force-crack opening diagram (COD) like that shown in Fig. 2-45. At low temperatures, 
unstable crack propagation with crack arrests takes place. In Fig. 2-45 the dashed area 
is the released elastic energy, and the newly created area can be detected by the “arrest 
lines” between crack stops. The cause of intrinsic crack arrest is adiabatic heating and 
plasticization of the crack tip. The size of the plasticization zones can be estimated by 
Figure 2-45 Force-COD diagram for unstable crack propagation.

PROPERTIES OF CRYOGENIC MATERIALS 137
the Irwin or Dugdale models [7]. The local temperature rise from adiabatic heating is
on the order of 50 to 80K for tests carried out at 77 K. The value of G]C ranges from 
0.16 to 9.8 kJ/m2 at low temperatures (see Table A-4 in the appendix).
There is an additional complication for several polymers (e.g., PC, PE). In De­
coded systems, Gjc is much larger than in helium environments at the same temperature. 
Nitrogen enhances craze formation, which consumes Energy during crack propagation.
Adiabatic heating at the crack tip occurs not only during unstable crack propagation
but also at very fast deformation rates [8]. Microcracks exist in every polymer and 
any one may form the nucleus of a macroscopic crack during loading. At very fast 
deformation rates, adiabatic heating and plasticization occur at the crack tips and increase 
fracture strength and strain significantly. These processes are especially enhanced at low 
temperatures, where specific heat is small and fracture energy by internal friction or 
chain scissioning causes large temperature rises.
2-5-11 Fatigue Behavior
At cyclic loading, damage accumulates until fracture occurs. The fatigue behavior de­
pends on the load amplitude (stress or strain), the mean load am, and the frequency. The 
loading is generally characterized by the ratio
/? — minimum load/maximum load.
Two important types of uniaxial loading are
• Tensile threshold (7? ~ 0)
• Alternative tension-compression (7? « -1). The load-time profiles are shown in 
Fig. 2-46. An aspect of fatigue loading is the internal heating of the specimen, which 
is affected by the frequency, the sample size, and the cooling conditions. The heat 
produced in a specimen is given by
W ~~ nr (tan 5) E ’/or?
(2-19)
where tan A is the loss factor (small at these temperatures), aa is the stress amplitude,
f is the frequency, and E is the Young’s modulus.

In the case of surface cooling, much of the heat is removed, but the center of the 
specimen is heated [6]. For LN2-cooling of an 8-mm-diameterrod, a frequency upto 100 
Hz can be applied for R % 0, but for R % — 1, only a quarter of this frequency (25 Hz) 
is possible without significant heating. The reason is that at the same cru for R % — 1, ora 
is twice that of R ~ 0 (see Fig. 2-46), and the internal heat depends quadratically on ara. 
Fatigue curves at 4.2 and 77 K are shown in Figs. 2-47(a,b). As can be seen, there is no 
large difference in fatigue behavior at these two temperatures [9].
For R % —1, the fatigue curves are very similar to R & 0 curves if a sufficiently 
low frequency is applied. In Fig. 2-48 shear fatigue curves are shown. The static shear 
strength is higher in PEEK, but degradation is similar for both polymers [10].
2-5-12 Thermal Vibrations of Polymers
The thermal properties of polymers are determined by thermal vibrations more gener­
ally known as phonons. The term phonon comprises energy, momentum, velocity, and 
polarization. The loose structure of polymers gives rise to several vibrational modes 
[H]:
1. Longitudinal vibrations alon
the chain (intrachain vibrations)
• Driven by covalent binding forces
• Significant above 50 K
2. Transverse vibrations alon
the chains
• Result from the intrinsic bending stiffness
• Significant above 80 K
3. Stretching vibration between chains (interchain vibrations)
• Driven by van der Waals forces
• Dominate below 50 K

77 K.
4. Tunneling vibrations (nonpropagating vibration or localized mode)
• Dominant below 1 K
A more general phonon theory defines the vibrational modes according to the force 
constants. The most important modes are stretching vibrations (change of distance) and 
bending vibrations (change of valence angle).
Stretching phonons that are driven mainly by van der Waals forces are long-wave­
length vibrations that propagate in three dimensions. Thus, they propagate in a continuum.
Stretching phonons that are driven by covalent binding are short-wavelength vibra­
tions and are bound to the polymer chain; they are longitudinal vibrations in linear chains.
Bending phonons result from the intrinsic bending stiffness of the chains. Below 
10 K, wavelengths are large and the valence angles are not stressed. Bending phonons 
become significant above 10K and propagate in all three dimensions up to T ~80K. 
Above 80 K the wavelength is small, and the propagation is bound to the chain (transverse 
vibrations of stiff chains).
The different vibration modes lead to different features of phonon density and prop­
agation. The density D and probability of their activation P obey certain temperature 
dependencies, which for D are specific to the mode. The probability of activation of the 
phonon modes are given by Bose-Einstein statistics.The thermal properties of polymers 
are determined by the specific mixtures of the phonon modes.
2-5-13 Specific Heat
The specific heat C relates the heat input Q with the temperature rise AT in a mass m.
Q = C(D m AT 
(2-20)

140 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
The specific heat can also be related to the volume or molecular weight. At low tem­
peratures, the constant volume and constant-pressure specific heat are nearly equal. The 
specific heat can be determined from the derivitive of the internal energy U, which has 
contributions from all the different phonon modes i:

The maximum frequency, o)max, is determined by each mode’s specific Debye tem­
perature, 0n which is on the order of 0 K for van der Waals-dominated vibrations; for
vibrations driven by strong covalent binding forces, 0t is less than 400 K. For each mode 
there exists a specific Debeye temperature. The temperature dependence of the specific 
heat can be determined by the exponent n of the frequency dependence of D.

2-5-14 Thermal Expansion
The different phonon modes contribute to the thermal expansion in different ways. Stretch­
ing vibrations contribute to the thermal expansion if the driving potential is asymmet­
ric. This is true for the case of covalent and van der Waals potentials, as shown in
Fig. 2-51. The mean distance of the vibrations increases with temperature. Below 50 K, 
the highest contributions to the thermal expansion arise from stretching vibrations driven 
by van der Waals potentials. Above 50 K, the stretching vibrations are driven by the

tentials as a function of the relative distance r of

more symmetric covalent potential, In this case the coefficient of thermal expansion 
(a) rises weakly with temperature. Contributions to a from stretching vibrations are 
always positive.
Transverse bending vibrations reduce the amount of thermal expansion. As shown 
in Fig. 2-52, the mean length of an aligned polymer chain decreases when the ampli­
tude A increases with temperature. Thus, transverse vibrations cause a negative thermal 
expansion in the chain direction. Perpendicular to the chains bending vibrations, how­
ever, cause a large positive thermal expansion.
If a fully aligned polymer is assumed, the coefficient of thermal expansion in the 
chain direction &n and the coefficient perpendicular to the chain direction aj. may be 
written as
OQ/ — H" OQ/b
(2-24)
= alw + afjLb
(2-25)
In the chain direction, the transverse bending vibration a//b usually dominates the Ion &
tudinal covalent component oc//c, and a negative expansion coefficient results. The com­
ponents perpendicular to the orientation of molecular chains yield very large positive 
values, both from the van der Waals vibration ot±w and from the transverse compo­
nent a_Lb.

An example of the expansion behavior fora fully aligned polymer (LCP) is given in 
Fig. 2-53. The direction of orientation an is small but negative, whereas aj. is positive

Isotropic polymers are entangled, and the main contributions arise from a±. This 
represents interchain vibrations in the van der Waals potential aj_w below about 50 K 
and transverse bending vibrations a_Lb- Above about 70 K, the wavelengths are small 
and restricted to propagation in the chain direction; only small components of a//b and 
otnc contribute. This is shown for real data in Fig. 2-54 and schematically in Fig. 2-55.

The Gruneisen parameter y is constant for most solids but not for polymers. This results 
from the fact that each vibration mode contributes to Eq. (2-26). The modes have partial
Gruneisen parameters yt of different magnitudes that dominate at different tempera­
tures. Thus, for polymers, y is strongly temperature-dependent. Examples of this are
shown in Fig. 2-56 for several amophorous and semicrystalline polymers.

PROPERTIES OF CRYOGENIC MATERIALS 145
The Gnineisen parameter for a polymer is a measure of the asymmetry of the bind­
ing potential. At very low temperatures, the very asymmetric van der Waals potential 
dominates and causes much higher y values than the covalent potential at higher tem­
peratures. The drop of y for amorphous polymers below 10 K comes from a tunneling 
contribution to the specific heat (the value of a is not influenced).
At first, itissurprisin & that y is not affected by glass transitions. The reason is that at 
the same the product of the thermal expansion and bulk modulus (aK) is fairly constant 
at glass transitions. The expansion coefficient increases at glass transition, and the bulk 
modulus decreases.
The Grtineisen parameter can also be used to calculate the pressure dependence of 
several properties. For example, the change in thermal conductivity k with pressure P 
can be obtained by
„ die 1 
y = K----------
r dP 3
(2-27)
where K is the bulk modulus.
2-5-15 Thermal Conductivity
Heat is transferred within a polymer by lattice vibrations (phonons) that are thermalized 
by various scattering processes. This leads to the establishment of “local” thermal equi­
librium at each point of the heat flux. Scattering occurs at tunneling systems at very low 
temperatures, at boundaries of crystallites below 20 K or cross-link points of thermoset 
polymers. At higher temperatures mainly defect or structural scattering takes place.
The thermal conductivity k is a measure of the efficiency of this heat transfer and 
is given by the relation
(2-28)
9
where Q is the power transferred through the cross-sectional area A and length Z.
An approximation for calculating thermal conductivity from the specific heat C, the 
density p, the mean phonon velocity v, and the mean free phonon path Z is:
X(T)« £c(TMT)v(T) |W/gK|
(2-29)
The temperature dependences of / and the dominant phonon scattering processes are 
summarized in Table 2-12. The thermal conductivity of amorphous polymers is constant
between about 4 to 15 K and has a T2 dependence below 1 K (due to tunnelin effects)
3
[3]. Semicrystalline polymers have a higher thermal conductivity than amorphous ones 
at higher temperatures. Below 15 K rhe situation is reversed where boundary scattering 
of crystallites drastically reduces thermal conductivity. Figure 2-57 is aschematic presen­
tation of the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity in amorphous, crystalline 
and semicrystalline polymers.
The impact of boundary scattering on the thermal conductivity increases strongly 
with decreasing temperature and depends on the size of the crystallites. For the same 
crystalline volume, more scattering surfaces exist for smaller-sized crystallites. (This is

for amorphous and semicrystalline polymers. The smaller the crystallite size, the higher 
the boundary scattering and the lower the thermal conductivity.

2-5-16 Gas Permeability
The loose structures of polymers give rise to a relatively high gas permeability. The 
highest values have been observed for amorphous polymers. Semicrystalline polymers 
are less permeable. The permeability also depends on the type of gas. Helium and 
hydrogen exhibit a similar behavior, whereas methane, which is a larger molecule, has 
a lower permeation capability.
The gas leakage rate Q through a material of thickness a, with an area A, driven by 
a pressure difference AP, is given by [12,13]
Q = P(T)4 AP lbar m3/s] 
a
where P(T) is the temperature-dependent permeatation coefficient given by
P(T) = Po exp(Ev/RT) [m2/s] 
(2-33)
Here R is the gas constant and Po is a constant specific to each material. If the permeation 
barrier (or activation energy) Ep is known, an extrapolation to any temperature is possible 
using Eq. (2-33). Typical Arrhenius plots are shown in Figs. 2-60 and 2-61. The slopes 
are proportional to £p, It can be seen that the permeability of helium and hydrogen is 
similar, with helium having a slightly higher Ep for a given material.

The amorphous polymers (PVC and PC) exhibit higher permeabilities than the 
semicrystalline ones (HDPE, PA12) or cross-linked ones. Epoxy resins (EP) and HDPE 
exhibit nearly the same behavior. The polymers PA 12 and PI (Vespel) have almost the 
same permeability at room temperature, but the slopes are different [14,15], It should be 
mentioned that PA 12 has a rather low permeability and can be used as a barrier material 
for vessels [14,16]. It is obvious from Fig. 2-61 that permeabilities with methane are 
much lower than with helium or hydrogen.
In Table 2-13 the permeabilities P al 293 K and the permeation barriers Ep are 
compiled.

Solubility and diffusivity. Gas permeation is thought to occur in three steps:
1. Solution of the gas at the pressure-side surface.
2. Diffusion through the material,
3. Desorption at the low-pressure side.
For an isotropic and homogeneous material, the permeability P is given by the
solubility S and the diffusivity D (13]:
P =
(2-34)
Typical values of S are shown in Fig. 2-62. It can be seen that the solubility is nearly 
independent of temperature [14,15,17]. The solubility of hydrogen is much greater than 
that of helium. For the diffusivity D the reverse is true, as shown in Figure 2-63.
The diffusivity is temperature-dependent and obeys an Arrhenius equation. In Fig. 
2-63, Arrhenius plots are presented. It is seen that D is highest for helium and lowest 
for methane. The permeativity is mainly dominated by the diffusivity.
A compilation of data on D and S at room temperature is given in Table 2-14.

2-5-17 Radiation Damage
In some applications, polymers are exposed to ionizing radiation. The mechanisms are 
different for y, e~, or neutron irradiation. In all cases, the irradiation leads to direct or 
indirect ionization of the electronic orbitals and gives rise to free radicals, chain scission, 
or changes in the covalent binding structure. Changes in the molecular composition occur 
when hydrogen ions are removed from the polymer skeleton f 18,191.
Neutron irradiation initiates additional nuclear processes involving high-energy de­
positions: 
• Hydrogen (H) knock off 
• High cross section of relatively heavy atoms in polymers containing halogens, such
as, PVC, and PTFE (Teflon). Thus, polymers having high densities of hydrogen or 
halogens are less favorable for use in fusion technology and particle accelerators.
The radiation damage depends somewhat on the temperature of irradiation and on 
warm-up before measurement. Degradation processes that occur during warm-up after 
irradiation include the following:
Free radicals, which are immobile at cryogenic temperatures, may regenerate or pro­
duce cross-linking or less favorable compositions.
Formation of H2
as (or other low-molecular gases) by neutron knock-off processes
and ionization by
anima rays. The dilatation of gas causes a foam-like structure and
is an important process of degradation.
The admissible dose is defined as that at which a property is degraded to half
of its previous value. For most polymers, degradation of mechanical properties oc­
curs first followed by dielectric and thermal properties. The dose of different radiation 
sources (gamma, electron, neutron) is intercalibrated and expressed in grays (1 Gy & 
100 rad) [19,20].
General conclusions. Polymers are resistant to radiation if their structure has
• A low hydrogen density (otherwise formation of H2 gas results) 
• Strong molecular units such as aromatic rings (not always true)
• Few ether bonds
• Few tertiary or quarternary C atoms
• Many double bonds or cycloaliphatic units

• Few possibilities for radiation-induced cross-linking (e.g., PE is very susceptible to 
this effect)
• No heavy elements with large neutron cross-sections, such as polymers with halogen 
(PVC, PTFE, etc.)
• For epoxy resins, the following resistances hold:
best: aromatic amines
medium: cycloaliphatic components 
worst: aliphatic or acid anhydride components
The highest resistance has been found for PI, especially the cross-linked PI (Ker- 
imide). The lowest admissible dose is found for PTFE (Teflon) [21-23].

Degradation of Properties
Mechanical properties. Some results of irradiation on flexural strength and deformation 
(strain) properties are shown in Figs. 2-64 to 2-66 and Table 2-16 [20]. The impact of 
irradiation on tensile strength and elongation is shown in Figs. 2-67 and 2-68 [20]. The 
figures show that the radiation resistance is higher at 77 K than at room temperature. 
The impact is greater on the deformation properties than the strength properties.
Dielectric properties. The dielectric loss factor tan 6 is not seriously influenced by irra­
diation. A dose of 106 Gy causes a degradation of 30% for epoxies [24],

3-1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter is not meant as a eneral review of heat transfer but as a discussion of those
aspects of heat transfer that are particularly important in cryogenics. Some general heat 
transfer texts are Refs. [ 1-3], whereas Refs. [4] and (5) are books devoted to cryogenic 
heat transfer. The study of heat transfer is generally divided up into the topics of heat trans­
fer by conduct! on, convection, and radiation. This chapter follows a similar approach. The 
conduction section discusses thermal conductivity integrals and thermal contact conduc­
tance. The convection section covers convective heal transfer correlations for cryogenic 
fluids and boiling limits. The radiation section discusses the use of multilayer insulation 
(MLI) to reduce radiation heat transfer. The unique aspects of heat transfer in helium II 
(including Kapitza conductance) are covered in chapter 10 of this handbook.

when the temperature reaches or exceeds their band gap and superconducting compo­
nents must operate below their transition temperatures. Thus, designers of cryogenic 
instruments often are required to predict the operating temperature of each instrument 
they design. This requires accurate thermal models of cryogenic components that in­
clude the properties of the materials and assembly techniques used. When components 
are bolted or otherwise pressed together, a knowledge of the thermal performance of such 
joints is also needed. In some cases, the temperature drop across these joints represents 
a significant fraction of the total temperature difference between the instrument and its 
cooler. Although extensive databases exist on the thermal properties of bulk materials, 
similar databases for pressed contacts do not. This has often led to instrument designs 
that avoid pressed contacts or to the overdesign of such joints at unnecessary expense.
These are not always viable options. Although many people have made measurements 
of contact conductances at cryogenic temperatures, these data are often very narrow in 
scope and even more often have not been published in an easily retrievable fashion, if 
published at all. This section presents a summary of the limited pressed contact data 
available in the literature.
Theory of thermal contact conductance and review of work. Thermal contact resis­
tance is attributable to several factors, the most notable being that contact between two 
surfaces is made only at a few discrete locations rather than over the entire surface area. 
A close examination of even the smoothest surfaces reveals an asperity that limits the 
actual area of contact to as few as three discrete locations irrespective of the dimensions 
of the sample. This is supported empirically by findings that the thermal conductance 
of pressed contacts is dependent on the applied force and not on the area of contact or 
on the apparent contact pressure ["/].
As the applied force is increased, surface deformation of the material occurs. The 
initial area of contact increases and, as the material deforms further, contact occurs at new 
locations. The heat flow is constricted in the vicinity of the contact locations because 
of the narrowness of the effective areas of contact, as represented in Fig. 3-3. This 
constriction is, in large part, responsible for contact resistance.
Additionally, the presence of surface films or oxides contributes to the phenomenon. 
The thickness of these layers adds an additional variable to the conductance. In the 
case of oxides, because the oxide layer generally has high thermal resistance, it must 
be penetrated to obtain a consistent measure of the thermal resistance of the actual 
contacts. At low temperatures, each oxide layer acts as an additional boundary resistance, 
and the problem is compounded because of the acoustic mismatch between the layers 
(Kapitza resistance). Further, the thickness of the oxide layer is often a function of 
time.
Estimates of the constriction resistance have been made for specific assumed contact
geometries by modeling the contacts as individual elements. By arranging the elements 
in groups of varying heights, the asperity can be accounted for as well. Although contact 
pressure and material hardness can be used to determine the ratio of the sample surface 
area to the actual contact area, the equivalent radius of the contact spot must be well 
known, and a probability distribution of the spots must be calculated. Because each sam­
ple represents a new problem, estimation of the contact resistance from theoretical models

is not a trivial task [8,9], and most data in the field are empirical. Table 3-1 presents a 
summary of low-temperature thermal contact data available in the literature. [7,10-25]
Experimental data have shown [11,17-19] that the thermal conductance of metallic
pressed contacts increases accordin & to a simple power law function of temperature and
can be described by the relation
k(T)=aTn
(3-5)
where n typically ranges from 0.75 to 2.5.
Thermal conductance also increases asymptotically with increasing applied force. 
As the applied force increases, the actual area of contact approaches the apparent area. 
For uncoated samples of aluminum, brass, copper, and stainless steel at liquid helium 
temperature, it has also been found that thermal conductance is related to the surface finish 
of the samples. Except in the case of aluminum, for lapped sample pairs with finishes 
of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1,6 /im, the maximum observed contact conductance at 4.2 K 
was exhibited by the 0.4-/zm surface finish: For aluminum samples, the conductance 
was lowest for the 0.4-^tm surface finish and peaked at 0.2 /zm. Although several 
mechanisms have been postulated to account for this effect, no causal relationship has 
been established, and the possibility of a systematic anomaly in sample pair preparation 
cannot be excluded.
Because constriction resistance plays a major role in limitin
thermal transfer, in­
creasing the effective contact area by applying a conforming coating can significantly 
enhance contact conductance, even if the coating material is of relatively low ther­
mal conductivity. The reason for this is that, ideally, a conforming coating allows the 
entire contact surface to transfer heat, rather than a few narrow areas. In reality, al­
though the ideal condition is unattainable, considerable improvement in thermal contact

conductance is possible by applying conforming coatings. Several methods have been 
reported [15,21,22] such as gold plating the contact surfaces, coating the surfaces with 
low-temperature grease, or inserting a thin sheet of indium metal between the contact 
surfaces. Of the methods reported, a thin layer of low-temperature grease appears to 
offer the best enhancement of thermal conductance.
In practice, measuring such enhanced contacts is not as straightforward as it might 
appear. Ordinarily, the contribution of the bulk material thermal conductivity to the ther­
mal contact conductance is negligible; however, the high thermal conductance of indium- 
or Apiezon-coated contacts requires that a correction be made to the experimental data to 
account for the bulk thermal conductivity of the sample material between the thermome­
ters and the contact interfaces. Figure 3-4 represents the situation schematically. The 
upper sample temperature 7\j and lower sample temperature 7b are measured 3.17 mm
from the interface, resultin
in a AT across the bulk material of the samples. These are 
denoted by A 7b and A 7b in the figure. The AT of interest across the interface ATC is

where the quantities Au and Al denote the areas of the upper and lower samples, re­

Summary of experimental data. Data are shown in Fig. 3-5 for thermal conductance 
versus temperature at 670-N applied force for uncoated contact surfaces, gold-coated 
contact surfaces, contacts with a gold-coated aluminum washer placed between the 
surfaces, contacts having a thin sheet of indium foil between the surfaces, and contact 
surfaces coated with a layer of Apiezon-N grease. Although only copper is shown for 
clarity, similar trends are observed for aluminum, brass, and stainless steel. Depending 
on the sample bulk material and the thickness of the coating, improvement of thermal 
conductance ranges from a factor of 2 for gold coating to an order of magnitude for indium 
foil. The improvement gained by insertion of the gold-coated aluminum washer between 
the contact surfaces was essentially offset by the addition of two extra contact interfaces.
In Fig. 3-6, thermal conductance of copper contact pairs at 4.2 K is plotted versus ap­

law. It appears that the room temperature Lorentz number was used. At low temperatures, 
the Lorentz number is known to decrease by an order of magnitude [26]. If their data 
are corrected for this effect, they then lie within the range of the other data plotted.
In Figs. 3-7 through 3-10, thermal conductance at an applied force of 670 N is 
plotted against temperature with surface finish as a parameter for uncoated aluminum, 
brass, and copper sample pairs. For stainless steel, only results for the 0.8-)tzm finish are 
presented. Both the aluminum and copper sample pairs exhibit a temperature-dependent 
crossover of specific finishes.
Figures 3-11 through 3-14 present thermal conductance versus applied force for 
several 0.8-/xm finish sample pairs, with surface coating as a parameter. In Fig. 3-15, 
thermal conductance of bimetallic contact pairs (5052 aluminum/3O4L stainless steel; 
5083 aluminum/304L stainless steel) is plotted against applied force at 77 K [12].
Discussion. It is apparent that conforming coatings offer significant enhancement to the 
thermal contact conductance and that indium and Apiezon exhibit the most significant 
enhancement.
In principle, the same result should be realizable with any conforming coating. Pre­
vious work with gold coating showed that, although the conductances were improved as 
the result of gold coating the surfaces, the improvement was nowhere near the magnitude 
of that realized with indium. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, gold, although soft

compared with the sample materials, is still much harder than indium, especially at low 
temperatures, where indium remains pliable. Secondly, the thickness of the gold coating 
was 2 gm per sample, a total of 4 gm. The thickness of indium was 0.13 mm, over 
thirty times that of the gold. As a side note, although the superconducting transition 
temperature of indium is 3.4 K, no measurable effects of the transition on the thermal 
conductance were noted.
Although the insertion of indium foil between the contact surfaces greatly improved
the conductance, a significant improvement over indium was realized with Apiezon in 
the cases of aluminum, brass, and copper. Early data taken where only a moderate contact 
force was applied at room temperature before cooling of the sample pair were problematic 
and, in many cases, impossible to analyze. This can be attributed to the fact that, unlike 
indium foil, which flows, the Apiezon grease becomes rigid at cryogenic temperatures. If 
good contact is not made at room temperature, the resultant thick, nondeforming layer 
of Apiezon separates from the contact surfaces at liquid helium temperatures, and the 
thermal resistance across the contact area actually increases. To be effective, a large force 
must be applied al room temperature. This also assures that the layer of grease is thin,
providin minimum contribution to the resistance.
It can be seen from Fig. 3-5 that the improvement in conductance at 670 N and 6 K 
is far greater for aluminum, brass, and copper, being over an order of magnitude, than 
for stainless steel, which improves by roughly a factor of three. This suggests that the 
thermal conductivity of the bulk material may play a role. If the improvement in thermal

178 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
conductance over uncoated surfaces by the addition of Apiezon-N grease and indium 
foil is plotted versus the bulk thermal conductivity of the sample material, it appears 
that conductance increases in a roughly logarithmic manner with increasing thermal 
conductivity of the bulk material. The asymptotic leveling of the conductance with 
increasing thermal conductivity of the material seems reasonable, for the conductivity 
of the bulk material would serve as an upper limit to the augmentation possible with 
enhancement of the contact surfaces.

3-3 CONVECTION HEAT TRANSFER
3-3-1 Correlations for Forced Convection Heat Transfer
J. G. Weisend II
MKS, DESY Laboratory, Noikeslrasse 85. 22607 Hamburg. Germany
Introduction. As with other fluids, the heat transfer from a heated surface to a moving
cryogenic fluid may be described by Newton’s law of cooling
Q = hA(Tw-Tb)
(3-9)
where Q is the heat transferred, A is the surface area, Tw is the wall temperature, Tb is the 
bulk fluid temperature, and h is the heat transfer coefficient. The heat transfer coefficient

CRYOGENIC HEAT TRANSFER 179
is determined empirically and is typically a function of fluid properties (thermal conduc­
tivity, viscosity, specific heat), flow velocity, and channel geometry. The determination
of h is the most challenging part of usin
Eq. 3-9 to predict heat transfer from a surface
into moving cryogenic fluid.
The correlations for h are generally
iven in terms of nondimensional groups. The
most important groups for this analysis are the following:
Nusselt number
Nu = hDh
Reynolds number
D PvDh
Re —-------
Prandtl number
(3-10)
(3-11)
(3-12)
Pr = —~ 
k
These nondimensional groups are not completely arbitrary but in fact can be thought 
of as ratios of physical processes in the fluid. The Nusselt (Nu) number compares 
the surface heat transfer into the fluid with the conduction heat transfer in the fluid. 
The Reynolds (Re) number compares the inertial and viscous forces in the fluid, and 
the Prandtl (Pr) number compares the momentum transport with the thermal transport 
in the fluid.
The general form of the convective heat transfer correlation is then given by
Nu = f(Re, Pr)
(3-13)
With the exception of heat transfer in He II (see chapter 10) convective heat transfer 
into cryogenic fluids is not a priori any different than that for room temperature fluids. 
Thus, one can frequently use the same correlations that were developed for noncryogenic 
fluids. However, care must be taken to ensure that the correlation is valid for the flow 
conditions being examined and that the fluid properties are evaluated at the pressure and 
temperature of the cryogenic fluid.
Another issue is the state of the fluid. In this section, we will consider three different
possibilities; single-phase liquid, single-phase gas (which includes supercritical fluids), 
and fluids near the critical point.
Liquid flows In the case of heat transfer to a turbulent, fully developed cryogenic liquid 
flow the Dittus-Boelter correlation can be used [27] as follows:
Nu = 0.023/?e4/5Pr2/5
Here the properties are evaluated at the film temperature

the foliowin
correlation has been shown to be useful [4]:
/T \ ~057“(I
Nu = O.O23/?eb/5Prb/5 ( 
)
(3-16)
Here the fluid properties are evaluated at the bulk temperature, D is the hydraulic diameter 
of the channel, and x is the axial position at which Nu is evaluated. Note that this 
correlation will give results close to that of Eq. (3-14). In the particular case of heat 
transfer to supercritical helium, studies have shown that the best predictions are given 
by [28] as follows:
-0.716
Nu = 0.0259/?eb/s Pr2/5 (-£■
(3-17)
Flows near the critical point As discussed in chapter 1, fluid properties can vary signi­
ficantly near the critical point. The behavior of forced-convection heat transfer into flows 
near the critical point is also quite complex. For the purposes of this discussion, the near 
critical region can be defined as a system in which 0.8 < P/Pc < 3 and Tsat < T < T*  
[4], where Pc is the critical pressure, Tsat is the saturation temperature, and T*  is the 
transposed critical temperature. Reference [4] has a very good discussion of the problems 
in modeling forced convection heat transfer in this region. Researchers have noted both 
maximums and minimums of the heat transfer coefficient in the near critical region. 
Readers should view skeptically any convective heat transfer predictions in the near 
critical region and avoid working in this region if at all possible. With this warning in 
mind, the following correlations may be of occasional use.
An altered version of Eq. (3-14) has been shown to work for oxygen and carbon 
dioxide [29] in the form
Nu = 0.023/?e4/5Pr^n5 
(3-18)
where Prmin is the minimum of the Prandtl numbers evaluated at the wall and at the bulk 
fluid temperatures. Equation (3-18) does not work for hydrogen and also does not allow 
for temperature spikes that have been observed in oxygen in this region.
For the special case of hydrogen in which the bulk temperature of the hydrogen is 
above the transposed critical temperature, the following correlation can be used [4]:
Nu = 0.0208/?e4/5 Pr2/5[1 + 0.0146(uw/ub)]

3-3-2 Predicting the Critical Heat Flux for a Horizontal
Cylinder in Saturated Liquid He I
M. Shiotsu
Kyoto University, Dept of Energy Science and Technology, Gokasho. Uji, Kyoto 611, Japan
Introduction. The critical heat flux (CHF) is the heat flux at which boiling changes 
from nucleate boiling to film boiling. Knowledge of the critical heat flux in liquid He I is 
important as a basis for designing liquid-helium-cooled superconducting magnets. An­
other advantage of studying CHF in liquid He I is that we can obtain detailed CHF 
data near the critical pressure, which is rather difficult to do with ordinary liquids 
such as water owing to their high saturation pressure and temperature at the critical 
point.
Experimental CHF data for a horizontal cylinder in liquid He I have been measured 
by Frederking [30] with very thin 16- and 32-/2m-diameter wires underpressures ranging 
from 5.7 to 97 kPa. Recently, Shiotsu et al. [31 ] measured the CHF for 0.3-, 0.5-, and 
1,2-mm-diameter horizontal cylinders under saturated conditions at pressures ranging 
from 24.4 kPa (P/PCT = 0.11) to 198.6 kPa (P/Pcr = 0.87).
Figure 3-16 shows the CHF data [31], qCT, plotted against system pressure together 
with Frederking’s data [30] and Schmidt’s data [32] on a 52-Mm-diameter wire. As 
shown in the figure, the CHF at a constant pressure decreases with an increase in wire 
diameter, but this decrease is almost saturated for diameters larger than 0.3 mm. The 
CHF value for each diameter reaches a maximum at around 80 kPa and decreases when 
the pressure is changed from this value. The ratio of P/PQX at this maximum point is 
about 0.4, which is similar to that for noncryogenic liquids.
CHF correlation The critical heat flux correlation for saturated pool boiling on a hori­
zontal flat plate was presented by Kutateladze [33] and. Zuber [34] for noncryogenic 
liquids as
qcr = K LPn \?g(Pi ~ Pv)/Pv2]1/4 
(3-20)
The coefficient K fora horizontal cylinder was given by Kutateladze et al. [35] as a curve 
against the nondimensional diameter D', and by Lienhard and Dhir [36] as a function of 
D'. The predicted values of K given by Kutateladze and by Lienhard and Dhir are shown 
in Fig. 3-17 as a solid line and dashed line, respectively. The values of K calculated from
Eq. (3-20) by usin
the experimental data for horizontal wires in He 1 arc shown in the 
figure for comparison. The values of K based on the experimental data are significantly 
different from the solid curve given by Kutateladze in the lower D' range. The values

of K for D' larger than around 2 for the diameters of 0.5 and 1.2 mm decrease with 
an increase of D' (owing to an increase in pressure), although they are predicted to be 
constant.
Figure 3-18 shows the values of K in the range of large D' versus cylinder diameter 
with the system pressure as a parameter. The effect of cylinder diameter al each pressure 
is slight as expected, but the value of K for each diameter significantly decreases with 
the increase in pressure, especially near the critical pressure. Thus, the effect of pressure 
cannot be expressed through the variation of D’ caused by pressure, although it appears 
as if it were expressed in the P'-dependent region of K in Fig. 3-17. Shiotsu et al. [31] 
presented the following correlation of K based on their data, referring to Frederking’s 
data for horizontal wires of 16.2- and 32-^m diameter:
K = 0.155(1 +O.O35/D)[pi/(pi + X>v)]3/2
(3-21)
The correlation for the critical heat flux in saturated pool boiling for a horizontal cylinder 
in liquid He I is then a combination of Eqs. (3-20) and (3-21) as follows:
*7cr/f
*Pv
= 0.155(1 + 0.035/D)(pi/(P1 + Pv)]3/2[a«(Pi - Pv)/P,2]'/4
(3-22)
Figure 3-19 shows the comparison of the existing data with the correlation. It can be 
seen that these data for pressures from that near the X point to that near the critical point 
and for cylinder diameters from 16.2 gm to 1.2 mm are within ±15% of the values given

Shiotsu et al. [31] showed that Eq. (3-22) with D —► oo would also be applicable 
for horizontal plates: the CHF data for He I (P/Pcr = 0,027 — 0.95) by Lyon [37], 
those for ethanol (7>/Pcr = 0.016 ~ 0.92) by Chichelli and Bonilla [38], and those 
for water (P/Pcr — 0.046 — 0.85) by Kazakova [39] on horizontal flat surfaces facing 
upwards are compared in Fig. 3-20 with the values derived from Eq. (3-22) in which 
D is taken to be infinity. These data for helium, ethanol, and water were almost in 
agreement with the values given by Kutateladze’s correlation for horizontal plates in the 
lower pressure range, but they became lower than the predicted values with increasing 
pressure and reached about 50 to 60% of the predicted values at the highest pressure for 
each liquid. However, as shown in Fig. 3-20, almost all the data are within ±25% of the 
new correlation throughout the pressure range.
Sakurai ct al. [40] studied the mechanism for nucleate boilin
in He I and suggested
that the CHF values for lower pressure that are almost in agreement with Kutateladze's 
correlation with a constant coefficient would be due to hydrodynamic instability, and the 
CHF values for high pressure becoming lower than predicted values would be those af­
fected by explosive heterogeneous spontaneous nucleation in originally flooded cavities. 
The suggestion is based on the analysis of heat transfer processes on a graph of heat 
flux versus liquid superheat close to the wire surface (A75ai.i) in comparison with the 
superheat corresponding to the homogeneous spontaneous nucleation temperature. The 
ATsatj was evaluated from the wire surface superheat, taking off the temperature drop

3-4 RADIATION HEAT TRANSFER
3-4-1 Multilayer Insulation Systems
Lockheed Marlin Missiles and Space, 3251 Hanover Street, Orgn. H12L Building 205,
Palo Allo. CA 94304
Introduction/Overview. Multilayer insulation (MLI), sometimes called superinsula­
tion, is the most thermally efficient insulation system known, achieving a heat leak ap­
proximately an order of magnitude lower than the best alternative techniques. Multilayer 
insulation systems, used widely in cryogenic applications, consist of low-emittance radi­
ation shields (commonly using pure aluminum coatings) often alternating with a spacer 
material such as silk or Dacron netting. These systems depend on vacuum conditions in 
the interstitial spaces on the order of 10"5 to 10"7 torr pressure for optimum performance.
The original work on MLI systems is attributed to Sir James Dewar [43].
In early work on MLI systems, Kropshot used aluminum foil for radiation shields 
and originated the approach of using low-conductivity spacer materials in combination 
with the radiation shields [44].
In addition to the ultralow heat leak, MLI has other unique properties. First, the heat 
transfer parallel to the layers (along the surface) is approximately 1,000 times greater 
than the normal heat transfer (through the blanket). This is a result of the relatively 
high thermal conductivity of the aluminum coating. This highly anisotropic property 
leads to great difficulty in the successful application of the system because thermal 
coupling between penetrations (supports, vent lines, etc.) and blanket edges can have an 
overwhelming effect on the applied system heat rate. Proper treatment and termination 
of the edges does not yield to intuitive approaches because of this extreme anisotropy. 
Second, the heat rate of these systems is very sensitive to layer density. A single local 
compression or poorly made edge can affect the temperature profile over the entire 
blanket, substantially increasing the heat leak (in some cases by several times), as shown 
by analysis and test data.
These considerable difficulties also create problems in the reporting of data from 
various types of apparatus—if the ends and penetrations are not perfectly treated and 
the layer density not completely controlled, the apparatus will yield data on a “system” 
performance relating to installation imperfections or to unique features of the test ap­
paratus rather than comparative data on MLI systems alone. It is believed that many 
disagreements in data on what are thought to be identical MLI blankets are largely due 
to these problems (different edge effects, etc.). Additional problems that can arise in 
testing include residual gas effects caused by faulty vacuum systems that increase gas 
conduction, insufficient test time to roach thermal equilibrium (particularly under the 
influence of a varying barometric pressure, which changes boil-off rates with time), and, 
for systems using helium, neon, or hydrogen as the cryogen, the presence of thermal 
acoustic oscillations (TAOs).

CRYOGENIC HEAT TRANSFER 187
The resulting testing is relatively costly and time consuming, which partially ex­
plains the many unresolved issues and the very large variation in the heat leak to cryogen 
tanks and equipment developed by different sources.
At the Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center, we have been investigating 
various types of MLI systems for approximately 25 years, principally for spacebome 
operation. Because of the high premium on minimizing system weight and maximizing 
lifetime, every possible means is used to reduce heat load for the system to a minimum. 
By far the most difficult obstacle has been the MLI blanket, which normally is the largest 
contributor to the heat load and the most difficult to predict and control. Because of this 
we have had an extensive research program to produce the best systems attainable.
Much of our work has been focused on optimizing the system for various sets 
of boundary conditions, with warm boundaries substantially below room temperature. 
Many of our systems have multiple cryogen stages with separate blankets for each. For 
example, we may use solid methane (T = 60 K) in combination with solid ammonia 
(T = 145 K) as coolants so that one blanket operates between 145 and 60 K and the other 
between 200 (radiation-cooled boundary in space) and 145 K. The optimum blankets for
these two conditions are different because of the relatively low radiation component at a 
hot boundary of 145 K. The use of multiple vapor-cooled shields on hydrogen or helium 
systems also results in various sets of boundary temperatures, each with an optimum MLI, 
Much of the information presented here is directed at systems in which the cost of 
the MLI systems (materials and installation) is a small fraction of the total, and therefore 
little effort is spent in cost effec’iveness. For some laboratory systems, the cost is an 
important factor, and approaches that reduce cost and give “good enough” performance 
are selected.
The present effort and cost of the maximum-performance systems are quite high
because they are applied a layer at a time, Techniques and approaches to reduce the labor 
involved but yet achieve a blanket with optimum performance are still needed.
The optimum application of MLI to a system is still rather obscure for many prac­
titioners of the art, and many of the complexities and subtleties arc not appreciated or
understood, leading to a large variation in performance of applied systems.
Description of multilayer insulation (MLI) systems Present-day MLI systems are en-
erally made up of radiation shields such as aluminized Mylar alternating with low- 
conductivity spacers such as silk or Dacron netting. There arc also numerous systems 
that have been tested or are in use that have integral spacers, such as “crinkled” alu­
minized Mylar or “Dimplar,” in which the shields are treated to provide bumps that 
prevent intimate contact and resultant thermal shorting between shields. The benefit 
of the integral shield spacer approach is quicker installation time; the disadvantage is 
reduced thermal performance.
Development of governing equations Our approach in developing the governing equa 
tions for an MLI system is based on a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical 
data. The empirical data are principally associated with the heat transfer through the 
spacer material, which is very complex because of the thermal resistance at the bound­
ary between the spacer and the radiation shield.

Of the various apparatuses used for MLI testing, we believe the most ideal (unper­
turbed) is the double-guarded flat-plate apparatus (Fig. 3-21). This apparatus consists 
essentially of a calorimeter and two guard cryogen reservoirs, a hot-boundary surface 
plate, a vacuum chamber and pumping system, and a means for remotely changing and 
measuring the specimen thickness [45]. An edge guard ring is provided to control the 
radiative environment viewed by the circumferential edge of the specimen. Suitable 
decoupling between the MLI edge and the guard ring is verified in the calibration pro­
cedure, in which the effect of variations in the guard-ring temperature profile on the 
measured heat flux is shown to be negligible over the range of variation experienced 
during the test.
This apparatus has a lower limit for the layer density because of the self-weighting 
of the layers, unlike some other approaches (for example, vertical shields or tanks) in 
which lower layer densities are possible. During the tests, the layer density is varied 
by a movable boundary to permit layer density effects to be measured. The boundary 
temperatures are also varied by using various cryogens and appropriate heaters. Testing 
was conducted on a wide variety of systems over a wide range of conditions so that 
semiempirical equations could be developed to predict the performance of the MLI. In 
developing these models, the radiation was modeled theoretically (with experimentally 
verified values of the shield emissivity), and the conduction through the spacers was 
determined empirically as a function of layer density for each material. We believe this 
testing provides the basis for the thermal performance of an ideally applied blanket. 
Whether this value could be attained or approached on real hardware is discussed in the 
following paragraphs.
Some of the data on the emissivity of the shields, obtained on an emittance calorime­
ter [45], are presented in Figs. 3-22 and 3-23 forgoldized Mylar and aluminized Mylar, 
both vacuum metallized. Note that the emittance for gold is lower than that for aluminum

at room temperature but higher at the cryogenic temperatures. The value of the total hemi­
spherical emittance for bulk material as a function of temperature as predicted by the 
anomalous skin effect theory (ASE) [46] is shown for gold (Fig. 3-22) and for an alu­
minum thickness of 400 A (Fig. 3-23). Data on various coatings at various thicknesses at 
300 K are shown in Fig. 3-24 [47]. Note that the coating thickness must be on the order 
of 800 A at 300 K in order to attain the asymptotic value. Although little data on the effect 
of thickness on the emittance at lower temperatures are available, the ASE theory can be 
used to predict this effect. Figure 3-25 [48], shows these predictions, which indicate that 
about the same thickness is required, regardless of temperature. Although we assume 
that a thin aluminum oxide surface film forms, which we believe to be transparent to the 
radiation wavelengths of interest, this matter has not been resolved to our knowledge. 
Vacuum-metallized Mylar may have a widely varying thickness as received and must be 
carefully controlled and checked to ensure acceptable values.
Some typical thermal performance data for gold and aluminized shields using dou­
ble layers of silk net are shown in Figs. 3-26 and 3-27, These results are for a warm­
boundary temperature of 278 K and cold boundaries of 20 and 77 K. The test data for 
the four systems studied for a 77-K cold boundary are summarized and compared in 
Fig. 3-28.

This equation has been shown to be very useful in predictin
the performance of various
systems. It provides a basis for predicting the minimum heat load to an MLI system, and 
when used with various factors based on tank testing (referred to as degradation factors
here), can be of substantial value in predicting and optimizin the performance of MLI
systems.
Parametric curves describing performance for ‘ * ideal99 insu lation blanket Th e fo 11 ow­
ing parametric data present plots of the MLI blanket heat rate per unit area (mW/m2) 
as a function of the major variables. These data are based on Eq. 3-23 and therefore are 
representative of a perfect installation of the best blanket materials we have found.
Real installation effects, which can have considerable effect on the heat rate, are 
described below.

at three hot boundary temperatures 300, 225, and 77 K The X/XDon} coordinate of 
I represents the reference values of the parameters (E — 0 03, 
= 37 layers/in ,
7c = 4 2 K, and Th = 300,225, or 77 K, depending on the figure)
The heat flux for various conditions can be calculated using Fig 3-29, which is for 
a 300-K hot boundary For example, if the radiation shield emissivity were 0 06, double 
the reference value, the heat flux would change from 270 to 410 mW/m2 If the layer 
density were doubled from 37 to 74 layers/in , the heat flux would increase from 270 to 
780 mW/m2, thus showing the high sensitivity to compressions

rather than in normalized form

Thermal performance associated w>th practical installations The thermal performance 
of an installed system is typically not as good as that presented in the previous family 
of curves Although this latter level of performance can be attained or approached, it 
requires painstaking attention to detail and very precise installation techniques with the
optimum materials Unfortunately, the effects of local compressions, aps, and so on are
not intuitively obvious and are normally mastered only after years of research, both m 
test apparatus and detailed analytical models These models typically incorporate several 
hundred nodes and are two-dimensional so that parallel heat transfer in the MLI blanket 
to the supports and penetrations is accounted for
At Lockheed Martin we have conducted an extensive series of testing on “tank
colorimeters ” These are tanks of various sizes that have been carefully designed and
constructed so that the heat losses from penetrations such as fill lines and su

Summary. It is hoped that this brief summary will be useful to those designing cryogenic 
equipment. The difficulty of achieving optimum values in insulating equipment should 
not be underestimated. Unfortunately there is not sufficient space available to cover the 
many other facets of this technology, such as appropriate treatment of the edges of the 
blankets, where they may come into contact with penetrations and local compressions 
that may be caused by special geometry or packaging requirements. Our experience 
indicates that these are among the most important installation features. References 50-58 
give additional details on MLI systems.

4-1 MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS
Making measurements at cryogenic temperatures requires far greater care than the mak­
ing of similar measurements near room temperature. Just finding sensors and signal 
conditioners capable of working at cryogenic temperatures can be a challenge. Cryo­
genic measurement systems commonly operate with many of their components at room 
temperature to avoid problems with operation at low temperatures. Additional prob­
lems are created as the distance increases between the measurement location and the 
instrumentation.
This review chapter can cover little material not specific to cryogenic instrumen­
tation. The reader is referred to other general sources on the subjects of measurement 
and instrumentation [1-3]. The chapter is organized with general cryogenic measure­
ment system considerations followed by separate sections on specific measurements 
(temperature, strain, pressure, flow, liquid level, magnetic, and other).
4-1-1 Balanced Design of a Measurement System
A system to measure a physical quantity is typically made up of interacting components, 
as shown in Fig. 4-1. The sensor responds to the quantity of interest and produces an 
electrical or optical output that can be measured by the instrumentation. The system is 
shown with the sensor inside and the instrumentation outside the cryogenic environment, 
but all combinations are possible.
The performance of a measurement system depends on the performance of each of
the components. The sensor often requires the greatest attention in a cryogenic measure­
ment system, but the entire system must still be considered. The process of designing a 
measurement system can be described with the following steps:
203

204 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
1. Decide what is to be measured.
2. Find sensors that will work in the environment.
3. Design measurement systems around the sensors.
4. Select the best sensor and measurement system combination.
Sometimes no sensors will work in an environment, or only one sensor will work, and 
the measurement system must be designed around that sensor. More commonly, more 
than one sensor will work and trade-offs must be made between cost, size, accuracy, 
ease of use, or other considerations to select the best sensor and overall measurement 
system.
4-1-2 Defining the Measurement
The physical property to be measuredis frequently
iven, whether it is temperature, pres­
sure, liquid level, strain, or some other quantity. In some cases the required measurement 
can be inferred from other measurements that are more convenient to make.
Also important is the choice of resolution, precision, or accuracy as the important 
statistical feature of the measurement. Good resolution is easiest to achieve, and good 
accuracy is hardest to achieve. Selecting an inappropriate statistical measure either adds 
cost to, or decreases the value of, a measurement.
Resolution. The resolution of a measurement system is the smallest change that can be 
detected in the measured property. Resolution is the most important statistical measure 
if, for example, small temperature changes must be measured, but the absolute temper­
ature either is not important or can be measured independently. Other examples are the 
measurement of pressure variations or strain changes.
Measurement resolution often is not affected by offsets such as thermoelectric volt­
ages or self-heating of the sensor. The unimportance of offsets also allows resolution to 
be improved by using filtered or bridge measurement schemes that eliminate the large, 
unchanging portion of the sensor’s output and allow the instrumentation to concentrate 
on the smaller, changing portion of the signal.

CRYOGENIC INSTRUMENTATION 205
Precision. The precision (or reproducibility or stability) is a measure of how closely 
the measured values are grouped. Good precision requires good resolution. Precision 
is important when successive measurements must return the same value, but the true 
value of the quantity is not required. An example might be a temperature control system 
that must run successive samples through identical temperature cycles, but the actual 
temperatures are less important than the repeatability of the cycles.
Accuracy. Accuracy is the closeness of the agreement between the result of a mea­
surement and the true value of the measurand. The accuracy of a single measurement 
can be no better than the resolution but is degraded by calibration and measurement 
uncertainties.
4-1-3 Selecting a Sensor
Look to the sections al the end of this chapter for information about cryogenic sensors 
for making particular measurements. The selection of a sensor for an application usually 
requires prioritizing the most important attributes necessary for the application and 
compromising on the less important attributes. The most stable and accurate sensors 
lend to be very large, slow in response, fragile, and expensive. Sensors with the highest 
sensitivity and resolution have the smallest dynamic range. Choices must be made. 
Several important sensor characteristics to consider arc listed in Tabic 4-1.
Next, develop measurement systems around the acceptable sensors and then compare 
the complete systems. For systems of comparable cost, size, reliability, or ease of use, the 
measurement uncertainty can be used to select the best system. Measurement systems 
not comparable on the basis of measurement uncertainty alone require development of 
additional selection criteria by the system designer.

4-1-4 Measurement Uncertainty
The probable resolution, precision, or accuracy of a temperature measurement can be 
evaluated using uncertainty analysis The expected uncertainty of a measurement is 
expressed m statistical terms. As stated in the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in 
Measurement [4],
The exact values of the contributions to the error of the measurement arising from the dispersion of 
the observations, the unavoidable imperfect nature of the corrections, and incomplete knowledge are 
unknown and unknowable, whereas the uncertainties associated with these random and systematic 
effects can be evaluated the uncertainty of a result of a measurement is not necessarily an 
indication of the likelihood that the measurement result is near the value of the measurand, it is 
simply an estimate of the likelihood of nearness to the best value that is consistent with presently 
available knowledge
The uncertainty is given the symbol u and has the same units as the quantity mea­
sured. The combined uncertainty uc arising from several independent uncertainty sources 
can be estimated by assuming a statistical distribution of uncertainties, in which case the 
uncertainties are summed in quadrature according to
HQ ”
(4-1)
Note that both sides of Eq. (4-1) can be divided by the measurement quantity to
express the measurement uncertainty in relative terms. Finding statistical data suitable 
for addition by quadrature can be a problem; instrument and sensor specifications fre­
quently give maximum or typical values for uncertainties. Two approaches may be taken
to dealin
<1
with maximum uncertainty specifications. The conservative approach is to
use the specification limit value in the combined uncertainty calculation. The less con­
servative approach is to assume a statistical distribution within the specification limits 
and assume the limit is roughly three standard deviations, in which case one-third of 
the specification limit is used in uncertainty calculations. The manufacturer may be able 
to supply additional information to help improve uncertainty estimates. Practical rec­
ommendations and procedures for problems related to the estimation of measurement 
uncertainties are discussed in greater detail by Rabinovich [5].
Uncertainty conversions using dimensionless sensitivities. A sensor produces some 
output signal such as a voltage, frequency, resistance, or capacitance that is measured 
by the instrumentation. Uncertainties in the measured quantity are not in units of the 
physical quantity of interest and must be converted before use in Eq. (4-1). In the case of 
a temperature sensor with an output voltage V, the temperature uncertainty u? is related 
to the voltage uncertainty Uy by the dimensionless formula
U\i/V _ ffy/V
(4-2)
The quantity in the denominator St = (T/V)(dV fdT) is defined as the dimen­
sionless temperature sensitivity of the sensor’s output voltage, where V is the sensor 
output voltage at absolute temperature T. The dimensionless sensitivity is also equal 

CRYOGENIC INSTRUMENTATION 207
to (d In V/d In T), the slope of the voltage versus temperature on a log-log plot. Note , 
that Eq. (4-2) can be made to apply to temperature sensors based on other temperature- 
dependent properties (capacitance, resistance, or pressure) by replacing V with C, 
or P as appropriate. Dimensionless sensitivities dependent on pressure, strain, or other 
physical quantities can be constructed similarly.
The dimensionless nature of Eq. (4-2) makes the comparison of sensors based on 
different property dependencies somewhat easier. A dimensionless sensitivity in the 0.1 
to 10 range is usually best for property measurements over a wide range, although other 
factors such as physical size or sensitivity to environmental conditions can be much more ” 
important. A large dimensionless sensitivity allows good relative temperature resolution, 
but the temperature range becomes limited if the value of the property measured becomes 
too large or small to be determined accurately with the measurement system.

4-1-5 Sources of Measurement Uncertainty
The following subsections discuss specific sources of temperature measurement uncer­
tainty and how to estimate their magnitudes. Sources of uncertainty include (1) sen­
sor excitation, (2) sensor self-heating, (3) sensor output measurement instrumentation, 
(4) thermoelectric voltages and zero drift, (5) thermal and shot noise, (6) electromag­
netic noise, (7) sensor calibration, and (8) interpolation and fitting to the calibration data. 
Example measurement uncertainty calculations are summarized m Table 4-2. Environ­
mental effects (e.g., magnetic fields, ionizing radiation, pressure, strain, heat leaks, etc.) 
are also important and should be included in uncertainty estimates but will be discussed 
later in the sections on specific sensor types.
Instrumentation measurement uncertainty. The accuracy of the instrumentation mea­
suring the output of the temperature sensor is normally specified by the manufacturer.
Analog meter accuracy is typically given as a percentage of full scale. An accuracy 
of ±1% on a 1-V full-scale range thus equals a voltage uncertainty «v of ±10 mV. 
The resulting temperature measurement uncertainty can be calculated using the actual 
temperature sensor output voltage V in Eq. (4-2). A major consideration with analog 
meters is that the accuracy of the temperature measurement decreases as the sensor 
output voltage drops below full scale.
The accuracy of a digital meter is usually specified as a percentage of reading plus 
a number of counts of the least significant digit. The percent accuracy is calculated 
as a function of the actual reading, not full scale. For example, a digital accuracy 
specification of ±(0.05% ±1 count) for a 4-1/2-digit meter reading 3.000 mV on a 
20-mV range equals a voltage uncertainty «v of ±(0.0015 ±0.001) mV = ±2.5/4.V. 
Equation (4-2) is again used to translate to temperature uncertainty.
Sensor self-heating. Any difference between the temperature of the sensor and the 
environment the sensor is intended to measure produces a temperature measurement error 
or uncertainty. Dissipation of power in the temperature sensor will cause its temperature 
to rise above that of the surrounding environment. Power dissipation in the sensor is

also necessary to make a temperature measurement. Minimization of the temperature 
measurement uncertainty thus requires balancing the uncertainties due to self-heating 
and output signal measurement.
Attempting to correct for self-heating errors by calculation or extrapolation is not
considered good practice. An estimate of the self-heatin error should be included in the

CRYOGENIC INSTRUMENTATION 209
total uncertainty calculation instead. Self-healing is particularly a problem for tempera­
ture sensors and is discussed in detail in that section.
Excitation uncertainty. The temperature measurement uncertainty due to an uncer­
tainty in the excitation current can be calculated using Eq. (4-2) by replacing the quan­
tity uv/ V by the relative voltage change due to the current uncertainty zq. The resulting 
expression is

where = dV/dl and /?s = V/1 arc the dynamic and static resistances of the tem­
perature sensor, respectively. Note that the dynamic and static resistances of an ohmic 
sensor are equal. Typical dynamic resistances of a Lake Shore DT-470 silicon diode are 
3000 Q at 300 K, 1000 £2 at 77 K, and 2800 Q at 4.2 K, whereas the static resistances 
are, respectively, 51.9 kQ, 102 kQ, and 163 kST2. As an example, the accuracy of a Lake 
Shore Model 120CS current source L specified as ±0.05% at 10 //A. For a DT-470 diode 
at 4.2 K, the resulting relative temperature measurement uncertainty would be

= ±9.9x 10“5 = ±99ppm
or a temperature uncertainty of 416 /zK.
Thermal (Johnson) noise. Thermal energy produces random motions of the charged 
particles within a body, giving rise to electrical noise. The minimum root-mean-square 
(rms) noise power available is given by Pn = 4fc T Awhere k is the Boltzmann constant 
and A/n is the noise bandwidth. Peak-to-peak noise is approximately five times greater 
than the rms noise. Metallic resistors approach this fundamental minimum, but other 
materials produce somewhat greater thermal noise. The noise power is related to current 
or voltage noise by the relations / = (Pn//?)°5 and V = (Pn/?)°5• The noise bandwidth 
is not necessarily the same as the signal bandwidth but is approximately equal to the 
smallest of the following [6]:
• jt/2 times the upper 3-db frequency limit of the analog DC measuring circuitry, which 
is given as approximately l/(4/?e(fCin), where /?ctr is the effective resistance across 
the measuring instrument (including the instrument’s input impedance in parallel with 
the sensor resistance and wiring) and Cin is the total capacitance shunting the input;
• O.55/7r where fr is the instrument’s 10-90% rise time;
• 1 Hz if an analog panel meter is used for readout; or
• One-half the conversion rate (readings per second) of an integrating digital voltmeter.
Thermoelectric and zero offset voltages. Voltages develop in electrical conductors 
with temperature gradients when no current is allowed to How (Seebeck effect). Thermo­
electric voltages appear when dissimilar metals are joined and joints are held at different 
temperatures. Typical thermoelectric voltages in cryogenic measurement systems are on 
the order of microvolts.

210 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
A zero offset is the signal value measured with no input to the measuring instrument. 
Thezero offset can drift with time or temperature and is usually included in the instrument 
specifications.
Thermoelectric voltages and zero offsets can be eliminated from voltage measure­
ments on ohmic resistors by reversal of the excitation current and use of the formula
V = (V+ - V_)/2
(4-4)
where V+ and VL are the voltages with respectively positive and negative excitation 
currents. Alternating current (AC) excitation can also be used with ohmic sensors to 
eliminate zero offsets.
Measurements made in rapid succession might not allow time for current switching 
and the required settling times. The uncertainty can be reduced by measuring the offset 
before and after a series of rapid measurements and subtracting the offset voltage from 
the measured voltages. The sum of the thermoelectric voltages and zero offset can be 
calculated as
V0 = (V+ +V_)/2
(4-5)
Note that the resolution of Vo is practically limited by the resolution of the measure­
ment system. The value of Vo can be expected to vary little in a static system but may 
change during a thermal transient under study. The value of Vo should be rechecked as 
often as practical.
The offset voltage Vo is best measured by reversing the current through a resistor. 
Measurement of Vo with zero excitation current is also possible, but large resistances 
can produce excessive time constants for discharge of any capacitances in the circuit, 
requiring long waiting times before Vo can be measured accurately.
Diode measurements do not allow current reversal. The value of Vo can be estimated 
by shorting the leads at the diode and measuring the offset voltage with zero excitation 
current at operating temperature.
Ground loops and electromagnetic noise. Improper grounding of instruments or 
grounding at multiple points can allow current flows that result in small voltage off­
sets. One common problem is the grounding of cable shields at both ends. The current 
flow through ground loops is not necessarily constant, resulting in a fluctuating voltage. 
Books on grounding and shielding can help to identify and eliminate both ground loops 
and electromagnetic noise.
Electromagnetic pickup is a source of additional noise. Alternating current noise is 
a serious problem in sensors with nonlinear current-voltage characteristics. Measure­
ment of the AC noise across the terminals of the reading instrument can give a quick 
indication of the magnitude of this noise source (thermal noise will be included in this 
measurement). Electromagnetic pickup can be reduced by twisting wire pairs, using 
coaxial cables, adding shielding, or shortening the wires.
Calibration uncertainty. Commercially calibrated sensors should have calibrations 
traceable to international standards. About the best accuracy attainable is represented by 
the abilities of national standards laboratories [7]. Many laboratories provide calibrations 

CRYOGENIC INSTRUMENTATION 211
for a fee [8,9]. The calibration uncertainty typically increases by a factor of 3 to 10 
between successive devices used to transfer a calibration. An algorithm for selecting the 
number and spacing of calibration points is given by Nara et al. [10].
Calibration fit interpolation uncertainty. Once a calibration has been performed, an
interpolation function is required for temperatures that lie between calibration points.
The interpolation method must be chosen with care, since some fittin functions can be
much worse than others [11]. Common interpolation methods include linear interpola­
tion, cubic splines, and Chebyshev polynomials. Formulas based on the physics of the 
sensor material may give the best fits when few fit parameters are used.
Use of an interpolation function adds to the measurement uncertainty. The additional
uncertainty due to an interpolation function can be gauged by the ability of the interpo­
lation function to reproduce the calibration points. Each calibration can be broken up
into several ranges to decrease the fittin
uncertainties. Typical uncertainties introduced
by the interpolation function are on the order of one-tenth the calibration uncertainty.
4-1-6 Other Measurement System Considerations
Wiring. Wiring for cryogenic instrumentation requires attention, especially when car­
rying low-voltage or high-frequency signals. Considerations for cabling at ambient 
temperature between the instruments and the Dewar or cryogenic enclosure include 
(1) physical robustness; (2) low resistance; (3) coaxial, triaxial, or twisted and shielded 
pairs to reduce noise; (4) use of separate conductor pairs for excitation current and 
voltage sensing; and (5) markings that will last the life of the cable. Pen on masking 
tape is not adequate! Connectors are frequently a weak link; consider (1) the ability 
of the connector to make the required number of matings, (2) strain relief for the ca­
bling, (3) potential for generating thermoelectric voltages, (4) resistances of the contacts, 
(5) noise generated by the contacts, and (6) case of repair or rewiring. Feed-throughs 
or bulkhead connectors are frequently required at interfaces to the cryogenic or vac­
uum environment. Vacuum-tight (hermetic) feed-throughs capable of operating at low 
temperatures are often expensive, available in limited variety, and prone to failure on 
thermal cycling. Locate vacuum-tight feed-throughs at ambient temperature when pos­
sible. Junction-type feed-throughs should be kept isothermal to reduce thermoelectric 
voltages. An alternative is to use continuous wire feed-throughs in regions with temper­
ature gradients.
One of the first steps is to determine the number and type of wires required. Most
resistance measurements require four leads to eliminate errors due to the resistance of the
current-carryin
leads. Two wires sometimes can be used if the sensor has high sensitivity 
and the lead resistance is small relative to the active sensor resistance. Use Eq. (4-2) to 
determine if the additional error due to the resistance of lead wires is tolerable. Three 
wire measurements are sometimes used at room temperature, but the saving of one wire 
is usually not worth the additional uncertainty or effort for cryogenic measurements. 
Another trick is to connect sensors in series or parallel, depending on the excitation 
mode, but the increased risk of losing several sensors due to some break or failure in the 
circuit must be considered carefully.

212 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
Wiring can provide a significant heat conduction path from the ambient environment
to a sensor at cryogenic temperatures. The heat conducted to the cryogenic environment 
wastes expensive cooling power and can affect the operation of the sensor. The heat
conducted to the cryogenic environment can be reduced by the following means:
I. Use wires of low thermal conductivity materials, such as manganin, constantan, phos­
phor bronze, nichrome, stainless steel, or Evan-ohm, The thermal conductivity and 
electrical resistivity of a metal are inversely related, and thus lower thermal conduc­
tivities come at the expense of increased electrical resistivity.
2. Use wires with smaller cross section,
3. Make the wires longer.
4. Reduce the number of wires,
5. Heat sink the wires at a temperature near the sensor operating temperature to intercept 
the heat leak.
6. Reduce the insulation thickness to improve contact with the heat sink. Thin enamel 
is better than thicker Teflon.
The arrangement used to analyze wire heat-sinking requirements is shown in
Fig. 4-2. The required heat-sinking length is a function of the wire material, wire cross 
section, temperature difference between the ends of the wire, and the tolerable temper­
ature rise at the sensor. Bust [12] devised a procedure for calculating the heat-sinkina
length given as follows with some modifications to allow for the now common ability
to calculate inverse hyperbolic sines with ease:
1, Compute
m = (Kc4./Kw4wf)05
where Kc is the thermal conductivity of the adhesive at temperature T = (T? + T$)/2, 
Kw is the thermal conductivity of the wire at T, Aw is the cross-sectional area of the 
wire, and d& and t are the effective width and thickness of the adhesive bond.

length of the wire before the heat-smk station, 7\ is the temperature of the heat sink, 
and f = (7? — Ts)/Ts, the fraction of temperature Ts that is allowed as a temperature 
differential after the heat-sink station. Note that Bust used a fixed-temperature differ­
ential, but temperature errors are relative (1 mK is much more significant at 1 K than 
at lOOOK), and thus a means of expressing the allowable temperature difference as a 
fraction of Ts is more appropriate. Bust also used the mean thermal conductivity of the 
wire multiplied by the temperature difference (T| — T?) rather than the difference of the 
thermal conductivity integrals.
3. Set T2 — Ts as a first approximation.
4, Calculate the required heat-sinkin; length as L2 = mS‘nh
5. Calculate Tn — Ts(l + f B/2), Repeat steps 4 and 5 until 7? converges.
Typical values calculated with this procedure are given in Table 4-3 using the poly­
nomial fits to K(T) and £(T) given in Tables 4-4 and 4-5. The heat Q conducted down 
a wire of cross-sectional area Aw and length L can be calculated as
Q = -(M) - f(r2)l
(4-6)
using the thermal conductivity integral polynomials.
Low-loss wiring for high-frequency signals can require the presence of some low- 
resistivity electrical conductor, with the amount required depending on the signal fre­
quency, wire geometry, and allowable attenuation [13].
DC measurement instrumentation. Potentiometric four-wire resistance measurement 
instrumentation is shown in Fig. 4-3. Offset voltages and noise in DC measurement 
circuits are typically on the order of microvolts. The noise floor can be lowered an 
order of magnitude or more by reversing the excitation current polarity and combining 
the two measurements. Some measurement systems place a reference resistor in series 
with the sensor and provide switching of the voltmeter to allow measurement of the 
voltage across cither the sensor or reference resistor. The additional switching and data

manipulation are often well worth the improvements in measurement accuracy. Aver­
aging many readings obtained with high-stability instruments can push the noise floor 
down towards 1 nV.
Resistance bridges are also used for cryogenic measurements, but the lead resistances
must be fully compensated to make accurate measurements if the entire bridge is not in 
the cryogenic environment. The Kelvin and Mueller bridges accomplish this [14,15,16].
AC measurement instrumentation. Offset voltages can be eliminated by using AC 
measurements without requiring switching of the excitation and extra data manipula­
tion. Phase-sensitive detectors (or lock-in amplifiers, as they are commonly known) pro­
vide further noise rejection, allowing the possibility of measurements with subnanovolt

sensitivities. The ability to detect small signals allows the use of smaller excitation pow­
ers, which are often important in cryogenic measurements where even a small heat input 
can disturb the system. Note that because a phase-sensitive detector produces no even 
harmonics in its output, an exact even submultiple frequency output synchronized to the 
line frequency (e.g., 30, 15, or 10 Hz with a 60-Hz line frequency) provides automatic 
rejection of noise at line and higher harmonic frequencies.
AC instrumentation is more complex than DC instrumentation, but can be employed
economically on a large scale [ 18].
Pulse measurement techniques. Difficulties in measuring low-voltage DC signals also 
can be overcome by using pulse techniques. In one application at Fermilab [19] 50-/z$ 
pulses of 2.5 mA were used to measure carbon composition and platinum resistance 
thermometers at a repetition rate of 1 Hz. The average power dissipation was thus reduced 
by a factor of 20,000.
Control circuits. The properties of materials can change rapidly at low temperatures. 
Temperature control circuits especially must be able to adapt lo a wide range of charac­
teristic system response times [20], Selection of PID (proportional, integral, derivative) 
control parameters is especially difficult in a system cooled by a mechanical refrigerator 
operating near its minimum temperature.
Cold electronics. Ideally, electronic readout circuits should be located as close to the 
sensor as possible. Operation of excitation sources, multiplexers, amplifiers and analog- 
to-digital converters at cryogenic temperatures could greatly reduce the noise, number of 
feed-throughs, and heat leak. Unfortunately, many common semiconductor components 
do not operate below about 100 K. Currently available operational amplifiers use bipolar 
transistors that undergo carrier freeze-out and become inoperable at low temperatures. 
There are some exceptions, mostly FETs [21 -25], but operation of the readout electronics 
at room temperature continues to predominate.
Superconducting devices and circuits can be used below about 80 K and have 
some unique advantages [26]. One of the best known is the superconducting quan­
tum interference device (SQUID) capable of detecting extremely small changes in

216 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
electromagnetic quantities such as voltage, current, magnetic susceptibility, and mag­
netic field.
Communications bus bars. Communications bus bars can cause problems with in­
struments at cryogenic temperatures, especially when the instrument is used to measure 
temperatures below 1 K. In these applications, noise picked up from the computer can be 
transmitted to the instrument and along the sensor excitation to the temperature sensor. 
The noise current produces resistive heating in the sensor, yielding erroneous tempera­
ture measurements if the power dissipation is significant. In these cases, the computer 
should be optically isolated from the instrument. Many companies now sell inexpensive 
optical isolation kits.
4-2 TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT
Cryogenic temperature sensors have been developed using a variety of temperature- 
dependent properties. Common, commercially available temperature sensors include 
resistors, capacitors, thermocouples, and semiconductor junction devices such as diodes 
or transistors. Such sensors, suitable for use as secondary or tertiary temperature stan­
dards, are of greatest concern here. Primary standards-grade sensors are very sensitive to 
thermal and mechanical shock and are therefore not suitable for ordinary laboratory or 
industrial temperature measurements. Other temperature measurement techniques such 
as gas, vapor pressure, acoustic, noise, and magnetic susceptibility thermometry, are not 
covered here, for they require much greater effort to implement or severely constrain 
system design.
Requirements most often placed on temperature sensors include the temperature 
range, reproducibility, accuracy, sensitivity, physical size, thermal response time, inter­
changeability, and ease of instrumentation. In addition, the sensors are often used in 
harsh environments (e.g., high mechanical shock, ionizing radiation, or magnetic fields) 
and must be relatively immune to calibration shifts from these environmental factors. 
Important characteristics are summarized in Table 4-6. More detailed information is pro­
vided on temperature-dependent characteristics in Table 4-7, on thermal response times 
in Table 4-8, on temperature errors in magnetic fields in Tables 4-9, and on effects of 
ionizing radiation in Tables 4-10 through 4-12. Dimensionless temperature sensitivities 
of some representative cryogenic temperature sensors are plotted in Fig. 4-4. Relative 
temperature measurement resolutions are plotted in Fig. 4-5 for given excitations and 
measurement system resolutions.
A large variety of resistance temperature sensors (RTDs) are commercially available. 
Measurement with a four-wire potentiometric circuit (see Fig. 4-3) is most common. 
Measurement with an AC bridge has advantages at lower temperatures, especially below 
1 K. Measurement systems for many similar RTDs have been built [18,19].
The variety of cry ogenic temperature sensors in use reflects the difficulty in satisfying 
all requirements with a single sensor. Many sources are available with more specific 
information than can be covered in this general overview [27-31].

4-2-1 Metallic Resistors
Positive temperature coefficient (PTC) resistors are metallic. The resistance versus tem­
perature characteristic is nearly linear at higher temperatures and bottoms out at low 
temperatures, where the electrical resistance is dominated by temperature-independent 
scattering by impurities and defects in the metal. Constant current excitation results in 
decreasing power dissipation with decreasing temperature, as required to prevent self­
heating. A single excitation current can be used for a wide temperature range, which 
simplifies the instrumentation requirements. The most common metallic temperature 
sensors are made from platinum or rhodium-iron.

Platinum RTDs. Platinum RTDs are the most accurate and reproducible thermometers 
available over a wide range of temperature. Measurements in the range from 15 to 725 K 
are made routinely with a high degree of accuracy using platinum RTDs available from
several commercial sources. Accordin
to IEC-751, the industry standard for class B
accuracy is specified as ±0.3 K at 273.16 K and ±0.75% variation in the specified 
0.00385 KE1 temperature coefficient of resistance (5p = 1.052). Class A accuracy 
is better by a factor of 2. Individual calibration is required for accurate temperature 
measurement below 100K. Magnetoresistive temperature errors of platinum RTDs 
above 65 K are shown in Fig. 4-6 [32,33]. The magnetoresistance is orientation­
dependent and continues to increase below 65 K. A new type of platinum RTD with the

Rhodium-iron RTDs. Rhodium-iron RTDs are useful down to at least 1 K owing to the 
presence of temperature-dependent spin fluctuation effects contributed by the dilute iron 
alloy, typically 0.5 at %. The wide temperature range and excellent stability have made 
this a valuable thermometer for certain demanding applications. The magnetoresistance 
is large and somewhat higher than that of platinum.
Cryogenic linear temperature sensors (CLTS). Cryogenic linear temperature sensors 
(CLTS) are made by Vishay Micro-Measurements from thin-foil sensing grids lami­
nated into fiberglass-epoxy, The two alloys are special grades of nickel and Manganin 
processed to produce a combined resistance that is very nearly linear in temperature from 
4 to 300 K, The resistance rises from 220 Q at 4 K to 290 S2 at 297 K with a temperature 
sensitivity of 0.2389 Q/K. The maximum deviation from linearity is about ±3 K. Also 
available are matching networks designed for direct readout with strain gauge instrumen­
tation [35]. The magnetoresistance at 4-6 K is sufficiently large that the CLTS has been 
used to measure magnetic fields [36,37], The CLTS is a useful temperature indicator 
where high accuracy is not necessary and requires only a 100-jzA current source and a 
voltmeter for instrumentation.
4-2-2 Semiconducting Resistors
Semiconducting resistors typically have negative temperature coefficients (NTC). The 
temperature sensitivity is often small near 300 K but increases with decreasing temper­
ature. The resistance can change by five orders of magnitude over the sensor’s useful 
temperature range. Semiconductors are typically piezoresistive, and thus bulk sensing 
elements must be mounted strain free, which reduces the thermal connection to the 
sample whose temperature is to be measured. Consequently, self-heating can be sig­
nificant unless measurement power to the device is kept extremely small. The large

resistance change coupled with thermal considerations results in a requirement for a 
variable current source for measurement in which the current must be varied from about 
0.01 /iAto 1 mA or more as well as a voltmeter capable of measuring voltages as small as 
1 /zV. The most common NTC temperature sensors are made from carbon, carbon-glass, 
germanium, Cemox™, and ruthenium oxide.

being manufactured [27]. Resistors with nominal values between 22 and 470 Q are most 
commonly used. These resistors are cheap (less than one dollar) but labor intensive to 
use. The outer casing reduces thermal contact with the environment and is frequently 
abraded away or sanded through on two sides. The large lead wires should be cut down 
to prevent straining and to localize the region in good thermal contact with the carbon 
sensor. Baking removes moisture and improves stability. In general, these are medium­
accuracy devices with only moderate stability on thermal cyclin a or aging. The frequent
need to recalibrate carbon resistors in situ has led to schemes for calibrating carbon 
resistors with a minimum number of calibration points [38]. On the plus side, they are 
physically small with low heat capacity, have fast time response, are very sensitive to

temperatures below about 20 K, and are only moderately affected by magnetic fields 
[39-41].
Carbon-glass RTDs. Carbon-glass RTDs are bulk devices manufactured from carbon- 
impregnated glass. The resistance-temperature characteristic is monotonic over the 1 to 
325 K temperature range and very reproducible below 100 K. Such RTDs have a very 
high sensitivity below 10 K and can be used for submillikelvin control in this range. 
These devices behave very well in magnetic fields in fields up to 19T, and accurate 
corrections can be made to their field-induced temperature errors [42] (see Fig. 4-7). 
Strain-free mounting m a canister is required. The contacts to the carbon-glass are a 
weak point and are prone to failure after repeated thermal cyclings.
Cernox RTDs. Cernox RTDs are ceramic oxynitride thin films sputtered onto a sapphire 
substrate. The devices have a monotonic response curve, and a single device can be used 
over the 0.3 to 330 K range with acceptable dimensionless temperature sensitivity. Other 
models are available that cover various temperature ranges with higher sensitivity in those 
ranges. Cernox sensors have lower magnetic-field-mduccd temperature errors than car­
bon glass, are highly resistant to ionizing radiation, and are repeatable to about ±3 mK 
at 4.2 K. The magnetoresistance becomes large below about 4.2 K, is complex, and is 
still not completely characterized (see Fig. 4-8). These devices are available in chip form 
(0.75 mm wide by 1 mm long by 0.05 to 0.38 mm thick) or packaged in a gold-plated

copper can or hermetically sealed flat-mount package. Their small size yields a much 
faster thermal response time than traditional bulk devices.
Germanium RTDs. Germanium RTDs have been recognized as a “Secondary Standard
Thermometer” and employed in the measurement of temperatures from 0.05 to 30 K for 
more than 30 years. They were used in the international intercomparisons, resultin
in
the development of the low-temperature scale (0.5 to 30 K) EPT-76 and leading to ITS- 
90. Germanium sensors are bulk devices available with different doping levels to meet 
the needed temperature range. A single device typically has a useful temperature range 
of about two orders of magnitude (e.g., 0.05 to 5 K or 1 to 100 K) and can normally 
be used to submillikelvin control in the lower portion of its range. These devices have 
extremely good stability (about ±0.5 mK at 4.2 K) and are probably the best choice 
for high-accuracy work under 30 K when magnetic fields are not present. As with the 
carbon glass RTD, these devices are fragile and normally packaged in a gold-plated 
copper can. The magnetoresistance of ordinary germanium RTDs is large and orientation­
dependent, although there is a report on a correction method applicable in the 1.5 to 10 K 
range up to 2.5 T [43]. Alternate doping techniques have yielded a germanium RTD with 
lower magnetoresistance [44],
Ruthenium oxide RTDs. Ruthenium oxide RTDs are typically thick-film sensors fab­
ricated from ruthenium oxide or bismuth ruthenate pastes. Thick-film resistors made 
for the electronics industry are intended to have near-zero temperature dependence at 
ambient temperatures, and the exact composition of the paste is often a proprietary se­
cret. Microcracks form in the thick film during initial thermal cycles, and thus 20 or 
more thermal cycles to 77 K are recommended before calibration. Depending on the 
model and manufacturer, ruthenium oxide RTDs can have low magnetoresistance below 
20 K [45,46]. Currently, these devices have the lowest magnetoresistance below 1 K of 
any commercially available RTD capable of holding a calibration on thermal cycling. 
Some commercial thick-film RTDs are interchangeable within the same manufacturing 
lot. Thin-film ruthenium oxide RTDs can be deposited but are not yet common. The 
primary application is in the presence of magnetic fields at temperatures below 1 K, but 
the thermal resistance is large at such temperatures, and thus low excitation power is 
required to avoid heating the temperature sensor [47].
Thermistors. Thermistors are typically made of sintered metallic oxides. Important 
characteristics include large temperature sensitivity, small size, and low sensitivity to 
magnetic fields or ionizing radiation. The large temperature sensitivity reduces the use­
ful temperature range for a given sensor. Most commercially available thermistors are 
designed for use above liquid nitrogen temperature.
4-2-3 Semiconductor Diodes
Diode temperature sensors have several advantages over resistance temperature sensors. 
Diodes tend to come in the smallest packages (both physical size and thermal mass) and as 

228 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
such have faster response times. When properly packaged, diodes are very robust and are 
suitable for temperature measurements from 1 to about 500 K. Diodes are relatively easy 
to use, and the instrumentation is fairly straightforward for these types of devices. Only 
a fixed-current source (typically at 10 /zA) and a voltmeter with a range of 0.1 to 6 V are 
required for instrumentation. Their large voltage signal allows thermoelectric voltages 
to be ignored in most cases.
An important feature of diodes is interchangeability. A single diode series from a 
given manufacturer will have some degree of interchangeability defined in terms of toler­
ance bands about a standard voltage-temperature curve for that series. Interchangeability 
can be as good as ±0.1 K at 2 K and ±0.5 K at 300 K, and cost is directly dependent on 
the degree of interchangeability desired.
Diode measurements are no more difficult to perform but are typically less accurate. 
The reduced accuracy is a consequence of the nonlinear current-voltage characteristic 
and moderate dimensionless temperature sensitivities. The voltage across the diode can 
be measured only in the forward direction, and thus the voltmeter must now make an 
absolute measurement. Without current reversal, thermoelectric voltages and voltmeter 
offsets may be present, and these directly affect the achievable accuracy. The long-term 
accuracy and stability of the current source is also a factor. Fortunately, the small dynamic 
resistance reduces the uncertainty due to small cunent uncertainties by a factor of 100 
to 1000 (see the discussion with Eq. (4-3).
Current noise through a diode produces a shift in the temperature reading caused by 
the nonlinear cunent-voltage characteristic of the diode. A model developed by Krause 
and Dodrill [48] predicts the temperature shift for temperatures above the knee in the 
voltage-temperature characteristic. Changes in the conduction mechanism typically pro­
duce a knee in the 20- to 30-K region for silicon diodes, and no model is available for 
conduction behavior below the knee. The calculated relative temperature shift is plotted 
in Fig. 4-9 using a diode ideality factor of 1.8 and the temperature sensitivities of a Lake 
Shore model DT-470 silicon diode. The temperature shifts increase with decreasing tem­
perature to a maximum at around 30 K and then decrease. The following equation can be
used to estimate the relative temperature shift for similar diodes in the range 0 < 
<
40 mV and 30 < T < 300 K:
AT/T [%] = 277.68T [K]-2J1953 V£°1803 [mV] 
(4-7)
where the units are shown in brackets. The presence of significant voltage noise can be 
determined by connecting a 10-jzF or larger capacitor across the diode. A low-leakage 
capacitor must be used to avoid shunting DC current from the diode. If the temperature 
reading decreases measurably, then significant noise is present. An AC voltmeter can 
also be used to check for the presence of AC noise.
Magnetic fields strongly affect silicon diodes. Although, GaAs or GaAlAs diodes 
can be used to higher fields, these devices are not interchangeable and must be calibrated 
individually.
4-2-4 Capacitors
Capacitors are sometimes used for temperature measurement, but the largest application 
is in temperature control in high magnetic fields. The capacitance is usually measured

with an At capacitance bridge. Instrumentation for measuring capacitance is discussed 
in more detail in section 4-4-2. Some temperature controllers are designed to use a resis­
tance temperature sensor to control temperature in zero magnetic field and then maintain 
the temperature in field with a capacitance sensor. The time response of capacitance sen­
sors is usually limited by the physical size and low thermal diffusivity of the dielectric 
material.
Although SrTiOs capacitance temperature sensors are not detectably affected by
magnetic fields, they commonly experience calibration shifts after thermal cycling and 
have been known to drift with time while at low temperatures [49,50]. Phase shifts in the 
ferroelectric materials are probably the cause of the thermal cycling shifts. Other com­
mercially available capacitors have been investigated for use as cryogenic thermometers 
[51], but their use is not well established.
4-2-5 Thermocouples
Thermocouples are most useful where low-mass or differential temperature measure­
ments are required. They must be calibrated in situ because the entire length of the 
wire contributes to the output voltage if it traverses a temperature gradient. Variations 
in wire composition, homogeneity, or even strain can affect the temperature readings.
Many types of thermocouples are available for low-temperature use. Common types are 
copper versus constantan (TypeT), nickel-10% chromium versus constantan (TypeE), 
nickel-10% chromium versus nickel-5% aluminum and silicon (Type K), chromel versus
Au-0.07% Fe, chromel versus Au-0.03% Fe, and chromel versus Cu-0.15% Fe. Polyno­
mial fits for thermoelectric voltage versus temperature for several of these thermocouples 
are given in Table 4-13 [52,53]. Type E thermocouples are recommended for use in the

temperature range from 3 to 1144 K in oxidizing or inert atmospheres. Aluminum-iron 
thermocouples are most commonly used for measurements below 10 K.
AH but types E and K have one leg of a high-thermal-conductivity material, re­
quiring small wire diameters, small temperature gradients, or heat sinking to prevent 
the measurement from being affected by heat conducted along the wire. The require­
ment for a reference junction is another disadvantage for many cryogenic temperature 
measurements.
Thermocouples are very difficult to use as low-temperature thermometers in the 
presence of magnetic fields because the thermoelectric power depends on both the tem­
perature and magnetic field. Zero magnetic field effect is possible if the portion of the 
thermocouple exposed to magnetic field is isothermal, but this is difficult to achieve in 
practice. Type E thermocouples have a reproducible and relatively small magnetic field 
dependence but only marginal temperature sensitivity below 10 K.
4-2-6 Self-Heating of Temperature Sensors
Any difference between the temperature of the sensor and the environment the sensor is 
intended to measure produces a temperature measurement error or uncertainty. Dissipa­
tion of power in the temperature sensor will cause its temperature to rise above that of the 
surrounding environment. Power dissipation in the sensor is also necessary to make a tem­
perature measurement. Minimization of the temperature measurement uncertainty thus 
requires balancing the uncertainties due to self-heating and output signal measurement.
Attempting to correct for self-healing errors by calculation or extrapolation is not 
considered good practice. An estimate of the self-heating error should be included in the 
total uncertainty calculation instead.
The following are two approaches to dealing with the problem of self-heating:
1. Choose an excitation that allows acceptable instrumentation measurement uncer­
tainty and check to make sure self-heating is negligible at one or two points where it is 
likely to be most significant.
An easy way to check for self-healing is to increase the power dissipation and check 
for an indicated temperature rise. Unfortunately, this procedure will not work with non­
linear devices such as semiconductor diodes. An indication of the self-heating error can 
be made by reading the diode temperature in both a liquid bath and in a vacuum at the 
same temperature, as measured by a second thermometer not dissipating enough power 
to self-heat significantly.
2. Measure the thermal resistance in the temperature range of interest and calculate 
the optimum operating point.
Examination of Eq. (4-2) leads to the conclusion that an increase in the sensor 
output voltage will result in a decreasing temperature uncertainty, as long as the voltage 
uncertainty remains constant. This is possible with an ohmic sensor by increasing the 
excitation current. Unfortunately, a larger excitation will dissipate more power in the 
temperature sensor, raising its temperature above the surroundings.
The self-heating depends on the excitation power according to the equation
ATsh = PsRt = l2ReRt = V2Rf/Re
(4-8)

232 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
where ATsh is the temperature rise due to self-heating, Ps is the power dissipated in the 
sensor, 1 is the excitation current, Rc is the electrical resistance, and R{ is the thermal
resistance between the sensor and its environment. The thermal resistance is extremely 
difficult to calculate for all but the simplest cases and is best determined experimentally
usin the following procedure:
1. Mount the sensor as it will be used on a temperature-controlled block or directly in
liquid.
2. Record the output voltage as a function of excitation current (I-V curve) until signif­
icant self-heating is observed (when Rc — V/l isno longer constant).
3. Replot the data as sensor temperature reading versus power dissipated (T versus P).
4. Fit the data with a linear equation of the form T = To + RtPs to find the thermal 
resistance, Rt.
Thermal resistance values determined from some commercial resistance temperature 
sensors in common mounting configurations are shown as a function of temperature 
in Fig. 4-10. The thermal resistance varies with the environment in and around the
sensor package (vacuum, gas, liquid), sensor mountin (solder, grease, clamp pressure,
epoxy, etc.), and details of sensor construction. The thermal resistances shown in the
figure should be used only as a guide with reference to the source papers [47,54] and

preferably measurement on the actual sensor in the temperature range and environment
of use.
The optimum operating point minimizes the combined temperature measurement 
uncertainty due to instrumentation and self-heating. The optimum is determined by (1) 
writing the instrument uncertainty (Eq. (4-2)) and the self-heating (Eq. (4-8)) in terms 
of sensor power, (2) including these two terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (4-1), (3) 
differentiating with respect to sensor power, (4) setting the result equal to zero, and (5) 
solving for the sensor power. The resulting expression for the optimum sensor power is
V2 T(um/V} / uvT x2/3
STRtV2^e
where the first term on the right is for instrument uncertainties expressed as a fraction 
of sensor output signal and the second term on the right is for instrument uncertainties 
expressed in volts. Note that other experimental considerations might impose more 
stringent limitations on the power that can be dissipated in the temperature sensor.
As an example, consider a Cernox model CX- 1050-SD temperature sensor attached 
to a copper block operating at 1.6 K and surrounded by vacuum. The voltmeter to be 
used to make the measurement rs a Keithley Instruments Model 2000 with a one-year 
DC voltage accuracy specification of ±(50 ppm + 3.5 /xV). The sensor electrical resis­
tance Rc — 46,240 Q and dimensionless sensitivity St = 2.21 are interpolated from 
Table4-7 assuming linear relationships between log(/?e) or log|ST| and log(T). The 
thermal resistance = 150,000 K/W from Ref. [54] is about twice that of the CX-1050- 
AA model shown in Fig.4-10. From the voltmeter accuracy specification, «vVm/^=

mounted on the same temperature-controlled block.

Most measurements of strain are performed with bonded resistance strain gauges whose
relative resistance changes accordin
to the formula
A/?//? = FS(AL/L)
where Fs is the
auge factor or strain sensitivity factor and AL/L is the strain. Typical
gauge factors are about 2 for most of the commonly used metallic alloys and up to 100 
or more for semiconductors. Unfortunately, semiconductors are too strongly tempera­
ture-dependent for use at all but the highest and most stable cryogenic temperatures. The 
most common materials for cryogenic strain measurements are pure or modified nickel­
chromium (Karma) alloys. The copper-nickel alloy most commonly used around 300 K 

CRYOGENIC INSTRUMENTATION 235
has larger temperature and magnetic field effects and is seldom used for cryogenic 
temperatures. Typical resistances are 120 or 350 and the resistance change is linear 
with up to 1.5% strain at cryogenic temperatures.
Kelvin or Mueller resistance bridges are normally used to detect the small resistance 
changes in metal strain gauges while fully compensating for the lead resistances. Tem­
perature also affects the strain gauge resistance through (1) temperature dependence of 
the gauge factor, (2) temperature dependence of the resistance, and (3) strains induced by 
differential thermal contractions between the gauge and the specimen. The gauge factor 
varies nearly linearly with temperature and is about 4-5% higher at 4K than at 297 K 
for modified Ni-Cr gauges [59]. The resistance of a strain gauge typically decreases by 
5% or less between ambient temperature and 4 K. Strains caused by differential thermal 
contractions can be lessened by heat treating the gauge alloy to more nearly match the 
substrate material properties. Look for a gauge matched to a material as similar as pos­
sible to the sample. These last two temperature effects represent a zero offset and are 
commonly combined into one apparent strain. Pavese [60] measured the apparent strain 
caused by differential thermal contraction between a variety of strain gauge and substrate 
material combinations (see Fig. 4-12). The curves are normalized at 280 K. The effect 
is seen to be significant even with the modified Ni-Cr gauges.
One way to compensate the apparent strain or thermal zero shift is to mount two 
gauges in the cryogenic environment with one active gauge at the strained location and 
the second in an unstrained location otherwise identical. The two gauges form one-half 
of a resistance bridge with the other half at ambient temperature.
Magnetic fields increase the gauge resistance, especially at very low temperatures, 
producing a strain error. For the nickel-chromium alloy, a strain error of +160/u,m/m 
was found at 4.2 K in a magnetic field of 6 T, and the error increased approximately as 
the square of the field [61]. No magnetoresistance effect was detected at 77 or at 296 K 
with this alloy.

4-4 PRESSURE MEASUREMENT
Pressure sensors for cryogenic applications are not nearly as well developed as temper­
ature sensors, The reason is that the cryogenic pressure market is small, and therefore 
very few pressure sensors are actually designed for cryogenic applications. Construction 
details can strongly affect the performance of pressure sensors at cryogenic tempera­
tures. All of the pressure sensors used at cryogenic temperatures require individual 
calibration—none are interchangeable.
The easiest method to measure pressure in a cryogenic environment can be con­
nection by capillary tube to a pressure sensor at room temperature. Disadvantages of 
capillary tubes connected to room-temperature pressure sensors include the following:
1. Added complexity of the mechanical design and increased possibility of leaks.
2. Low frequency response of the capillary tube limits measurements to static or slowly 
varying pressures.
3. The thermomolecular pressure effect causes the pressure at the warm end of tfie 
capillary to be larger than at the cold end [58,63]. The correction for this effect 
becomes very significant below about 130 Pa.
4. Temperature gradients in capillary tubes can cause thermoacoustic oscillations in 
pressure [64,65]. The magnitude of the oscillations can exceed the pressure being 
measured. This is especially a problem with helium, Design to eliminate thermoa- 
coustic oscillations further reduces the ability of the system to measure dynamically 
changing pressures. More information on thermoacoustic oscillations may be found 
in chapter 9 of this handbook.
Pressure sensors are made with absolute, differential, and gauge connection ports 
as follows:
1. An absolute port consists of one port connected to the pressure of interest. A pressure 
reference cavity is built into the sensor. A vacuum reference should be used for 
cryogenic measurements, or the reference pressure will change with temperature, 
especially if the reference atmosphere condenses and freezes.
2. A differential port consists of two ports connected to two pressure sources. Common 
applications include venturi flowmeters or measurement of pressure drops due to 
flows through piping. Differential ports are typically capable of measuring small 
pressure differences. Be careful to allow for the full range of pressure differentials to 
be encountered during cooldown and operation. These ports can be used to connect 
to a vacuum reference, if available.
3. A gauge port consists of one port connected to the pressure of interest. A hole in the 
pressure sensor body allows measurement of pressure relative to the ambient.
Discussions of specific types of pressure sensors follow.

CRYOGENIC INSTRUMENTATION 237
4-4-1 Piezoresistive or Strain Gauge Pressure Sensors
A piezoresistive pressure sensor consists of strain-sensitive resistors (piezoresistors) 
on a diaphragm separating two pressure chambers. A pressure difference between the 
chambers causes the diaphragm to deflect, straining the piezoresistors and causing their 
resistance to change. Typically, four piezoresistors arc arranged in a bridge. The output
usually has a small zero offset at zero pressure differential and then rises nearly linearly 
with pressure.
Vom = Vo + Vs(P/Pfs) =« / 07 P
(4-10)
where Vo is the zero offset voltage equal to a times the excitation current; Vs is the 
voltage span between zero pressure and Pfs, the full scale pressure; and b is the out­
put voltage sensitivity to pressure and excitation current. Constant voltage excitation is
commonly used with pressure sensors at room temperature, but large changes in sensor 
impedance and the need for high-resistance lead wires into a cryogenic environment usu­
ally make constant current excitation more reliable for cryogenic sensors. The calculated 
relative pressure measurement resolution for a representative pressure sensor is given in 
Fig. 4-13. Note that 100/zA and 1 mA excitation currents yield the same resolution above 
60 kPa. This is because the larger excitation produces an output signal large enough to
cause the voltmeter to change to a less sensitive range.

a Ke ah ley 2000 DVM with ranges of 0.1. I, 10. 100, and 1000 V and 6-digit resolution (0 1 gV minimum).

238 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
Typical diaphragm materials include metal foils, sapphire, and silicon. Metal foil 
diaphragms have the greatest hysteresis but allow all-welded construction from com­
patible materials. The piezoresistors are deposited thin-film or bonded-metal-foil strain 
gauges. Sapphire diaphragms have low hysteresis but are difficult to make thin or seal 
to the package. They are most commonly found in high-pressure sensors. Silicon is an 
increasingly popular choice because silicon processing technology is well developed and 
silicon diaphragms are nearly hysteresis free. Miniature silicon pressure sensors can be 
made in small sizes, on the order of 1 mm3, including an internal vacuum reference cav­
ity. Small silicon diaphragms also have very high frequency responses. The excitation 
power is generated in a small region on the thin diaphragm, which can lead to problems 
at low temperatures or when the sensor is used to measure rapidly changing pressures
of a gas [66].
Construction details can strongly affect the performance of pressure sensors at cryo-
enic temperatures. Commercial piezoresistive pressure sensors are often unsuitable for
cryogenic applications for the following reasons:
1. The resistors frequently are made from a lightly doped semiconductor material that 
becomes too resistive at low temperatures. An ideal resistor material would have no 
temperature dependence or slightly metallic behavior so that the resistance would 
drop slightly with temperature and then remain constant.
2. Silicone sealant frequently is used as a protective coating or to attach the sensor chip 
to the package. The silicone contracts greatly on cooling, and the resulting pressure 
on the sensor element can distort the pressure reading or even damage the sensor. 
Protective silicone coatings also harden and screen the sensor from pressure changes 
in the fluid whose pressure is to be measured.
3. Seals to the silicon chip can break on thermal cycling or can be permeable to cryogenic 
gases such as helium. Epoxy or glass seals can be especially fragile. Some silicon 
chips are electrostatically bonded to a glass backing to reference cavities for absolute 
sensors. The glass backing might be permeable to helium gas, which could change 
the pressure in the reference cavity.
4. Compensation and linearization circuitry built into the package frequently does not 
work at cryogenic temperatures.
5. The reference cavity is filled with a as, and thus the reference pressure changes with
temperature.
Properties of some pressure sensors known to work at cryogenic temperatures are 
listed in Table 4-14. Siemens Model KPY pressure sensors were not designed for 
cryogenic applications but have been popular owing to their low cost and good operating 
characteristics. On the order of 20% fail during initial cooldown, but those that survive 
can be temperature-cycled repeatedly. The package style used for the older KPY-10 and 
-12 models is best for cryogenic use. Unfortunately, these models have been discontin­
ued in favor of a new package-43 in which the silicon chip is mounted to the end of a 
long Kovar tube. Almost any plastic straining of the Kovar tube seems to shift the sensor 
calibration permanently. The characteristics of a KPY-10 sensor are shown in Fig. 4-14. 
These characteristics are very similar to those reported for the PSI sensor [67],

Figure 4-14 Characteristics of a Siemens KPY-I0 pressure sensor (200 kPa absolute) as a function of 
temperature.
The Toyoda Model PD116S was tested in magnetic fields up to 8 T in the 6 to 41 K 
temperature range [68], The pressure sensitivity changed by less than 1.5%, and the 
zero offset changed by less than 1% of full-scale output. Unfortunately, the packaging 
contains ferromagnetic Kovarmetal, which will disturb the magnetic flux density nearby.
A multichannel differential pressure measurement module has been built from bare, 
piezoresistive pressure sensor die made by Omegadyne. The pressure sensor were tested 
over the range 77 to 273 K and —101 to -4-241 KPa [15]. A boron dopant density on 
the order of IO20 cm"3 in the silicon piezoresistors is described as one requirement for 
operation below 170K.

CRYOGENIC INSTRUMENTATION 241
4-4-2 Capacitance Pressure Sensors
A capacitance pressure sensor consists of two or more electrodes, one being a thin 
diaphragm that deforms under pressure, changing the gap between the electrodes and 
thus the capacitance. Several types have been built and used at cryogenic temperatures 
[69-72], but none are commercially available. A well-constructed capacitance pressure 
sensor has less than a 5% change in sensitivity when cooled from 300 to 4 K. The capac­
itance of these sensors is typically in the range of 20 to 50 pF. The change in capacitance 
is nonlinear with pressure, rising more rapidly as the electrodes come together.
The most common method for measuring the capacitance change is with a capaci­
tance bridge. A three-lead bridge should be used to eliminate the effects of temperature­
dependent lead capacitance. Coaxial leads are required, but the bridge operates at only 
a few kilohertz, and thus high-frequency performance is not required. The second com­
mon method of measuring capacitance changes is by incorporating the capacitor in a 
resonant circuit. A tunnel diode oscillator and inductor must be located very near the 
capacitor. Only one coaxial lead enters the cryogenic environment, but the lead must 
carry signals in the 10 to 100 MHz range. Resolutions of 1 part in 108 have been achieved 
with some capacitance pressure sensors, although 1 part in 10s would be more common 
without expensive electronics.
Capacitance sensors can be sensitive to impurity 
freeze to the diaphragm and change the capacitance.
ases such as water vapor if they
4-4-3 Variable Reluctance Pressure Sensors
A variable reluctance sensor detects the position of a magnetically permeable diaphragm 
using induction coils on either side of the diaphragm. The two coils form one-half 
of a bridge circuit typically excited with an AC signal of 3 to 5 kHz. The power dissipated 
in the sensor is quite small, usually being on the order of 1 mW at temperatures of 77 K 
and below with conventional electronics and 5-V excitation.
Commercial variable reluctance pressure sensors with all-welded construction 
should be used for cryogenic use. Differential models with pressure ranges up to about 
100 kPa have been found to remain linear at cryogenic temperatures [10], The sensi­
tivities decreased by about 13% from 300 to 77 K but then remained unchanged down 
to 4 K. Their size and mass are relatively large, but they arc rugged and have been 
qualified for space applications [73]. Overpressurization had little effect on sensitivity. 
Linearity and repeatability of the sensors were within 1 % after a few temperature cycles. 
Large deviations from linearity at 4 K have been observed in high-pressure models 
(5 MPa).
4-4-4 Piezoelectric Pressure Sensors
Dynamic (changing) pressures can be measured with some commercial piezoelectric 
pressure sensors. The pressure sensor is designed to strain the piezoelectric element, 
which generates a quantity of charge A <7 proportional to the strain. No electrical power 
is required to generate the signal. The piezoelectric element has a capacitance C, and 
thus a voltage change AV=/\q/C is produced. Either the charge or the voltage can 

242 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
be amplified. The amplification circuit requires power. Location of the amplification
circuit in the cryogenic region requires only a twisted pair of wires (two conductors), 
which can have moderate resistance to reduce the heat leak down the wires. Location 
of the amplification circuit at room temperature requires a low-noise coaxial cable with 
high resistance (1014 £2) between the conductors to avoid shunting of the charge to the 
ground.
The output from piezoelectric pressure sensors is very linear with pressure. Typi­
cally, a single sensor can be used for dynamic pressure measurements from 100 kPa to
1 GPa with the pressure sensitivity over different ranges varyin by less than 0.5%. The
offset voltage and amplifier gain can be varied to optimize the output for a dynamic 
pressure range about a given static pressure.
4-5 FLOW MEASUREMENT
Many types of flowmeters have been used successfully at cryogenic temperatures. Sev­
eral are commercially available, with some havin
been designed specifically for cryo­
genic applications.
Flowmeters typically measure either mass flow or volumetric flow. Conversion be­
tween the two requires measurement or knowledge of the fluid density. Mass flowmeters 
include the following types: angular momentum, Coriolis or gyroscopic, heat transfer 
rate, thermal or calorimetric, and dual turbine. Volumetric flowmeters include the fol­
lowing types; Doppler shift, fluidic, laminar flow, positive displacement, temperature 
pulse, turbine, vortex shedding, and weir.
Differential pressure flowmeters such as orifice plates or venturi flowmeters are not
strictly mass or volumetric flowmeters because the square root of the density must be 
provided for either measurement. The advantages in reliability and lack of moving parts 
still make these among the most commonly used flowmeters.
Common considerations for cryogenic flowmeters include the following: (1) flow
range or turndown ratio; (2) compatibility with the cryogen; (3) disruption of the flow;
(4) heat load; (5) reliability, maintenance frequency, and ability to replace or repair the 
flowmeter, and (6) cost and availability.
Detailed descriptions of many types of flowmeters used in cryogenic service are 
given by Alspach et al. [74], Brennan et al. [75], Brennan and Takano [76], and Rivetti 
et al. [77]. Flowmeters specifically for use in He II have been reviewed by Van Sciver 
et al. [78] and in chapter 10 of this handbook.
4-5-1 Mass Flowmeters
Angular momentum flowmeters. Angular momentum flowmeters have a rotating mem­
ber with vanes oriented parallel to the axis. The rotating member is driven by an electric 
motor through a constant-torque clutch (hysteresis drive). The liquid enters the meter 
through a flow straightener and passes the rotating vanes. The liquid tends to retard 
the rotational speed of the rotor by an amount inversely proportional to the mass-flow 
rate. Rotor speed is sensed by a magnetic pickup, and the resulting signal is treated 
electronically to indicate mass-flow rate. A flow range of 8 to 1 is typical with these 
meters. Maximum flow rates may vary from about 2 to 15 kg/s. Pressure drops of

CRYOGENIC INSTRUMENTATION 243
20 to 50 kPa are typical at maximum flow. They have been tested with liquid hydro-
en by Alspach et al.
[25] and with liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon by Brennan
et al. [26]. Flowmeters of this type are often used as custody transfer flowmeters on 
delivery vehicles. Uncertainties of ±2% or less are typical.
Heat transfer rate flowmeters. Heat transfer rate flowmeters are also called hot wire, 
hot film, or constant-temperature anemometers. A temperature-sensitive heater element 
is driven by feedback electronics to maintain the heater at a constant resistance auto­
matically (temperature) as the flow rate varies [79]. The flow rate must be calibrated 
against the power dissipation using a standard flowmeter at ambient temperature. The 
heat transfei rate flowmeter is a true mass flowmeter for an ideal gas. Commercial hot 
wire anemometer probes have been used successfully for the measurement of helium gas
flows at temperatures down to 77 K [80,81]. The calibration was found to change in a
linear manner with, but not as a strong function of, the as temperature. The probes were
fabricated with a3.8-/4m-diameter tungsten wire about 2 mm long attached to the wire 
supports. The wire was heated to about 297 K to give high sensitivity and reproducible 
results. Because the power input with this high wire temperature was about 1 W, the hot 
wire anemometer was turned on only briefly when measurements were being made. The 
response time of the wire was measured to be less than 15 p,s in zero flow. The re­
sponse time becomes faster with increasing flow. The fast response time makes the hot 
wire anemometer useful for measuring turbulence, transient flow, or oscillating flow.
Oscillatin
mass flow rates up to 30 Hz were measured in compressed helium gas at
temperatures down to 77 K within a pulse tube refrigerator. The fine wire is somewhat 
fragile and can only be used in very clean gas flows.
Thermal or calorimetric flowmeters. Thermal or calorimetric flowmeters heat the
V
flowing fluid with a constant power Q, causing its temperature to rise by an amount AT. 
A thermocouple or thermopile measures this temperature difference between the fluid 
upstream and downstream from the heater. The mass flow rate is given by
(4-11)
where Cp is the specific heat of the fluid. This flowmeter is a true mass flowmeter. A 
commercial thermal flowmeter was used by Bugeat et al. [82] to measure mass flow rates 
around 10 mg/s of hydrogen and helium gas at temperatures between 100 and 300 K. 
They reported a nonlinearity of less than 2% and a response time of about 0.22 s at 158 K 
in hydrogen gas for a flow of 9 mg/s. Thermal flowmeters should work with flow in 
either direction.
4-5-2 Volumetric Flowmeters
Doppler shift flowmeters. Doppler shift flowmeters work by measuring the change in 
transit time of waves traveling with or against the flow. Waves of pressure, tempera­
ture (second sound in He II), and light have been used. When the speed of sound is 
temperature-dependent, measurements of the transit time both with and against the flow 
can be combined to eliminate the sound velocity. Ultrasonic flowmeters have been built 

244 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
by Lavocat [83] and by Hofmann and Vogeley [84]. Borner and coworkers [85] used the 
Doppler effect on both first and second sound in helium II to measure the circulation and 
flow velocities produced by a macroscopic vortex ring in He IL The signal processin 
required to determine a fluid velocity from a propagating sound pulse can be relatively 
complex. Laser Doppler velocimetry works by tracking neutral density particles sus­
pended in the flow [86], Laser beams can be focused to measure the velocity in a small 
region (~1 mm3). Disadvantages include the sophisticated and expensive equipment 
required and the need to introduce reflective particles.
Fluidic flowmeters. Fluidic flowmeters use hydrodynamic instabilities to generate os­
cillations in a flow stream, which are then detected. The oscillation frequency is pro­
portional to fluid velocity in the turbulent flow regime. The amplitude of the oscillating 
pressure signal is also generally proportional to flow velocity, and thus use over a fairly 
wide range is possible. The major disadvantage is the large pressure drop compared with 
other devices. Operation of a Coanda-effect fluidic flowmeter made by Moore Products 
has been verified in liquid helium [78].
Positive displacement flowmeters. Positive displacement flowmeters work on the prin­
ciple that the flowing liquid must displace or be displaced by some mechanical element.
The volume flow is proportional to the movement of the mechanical element. Types of 
mechanical elements include pistons, rotating vanes, and gears. A detailed description 
of these various types of positive displacement flowmeters and an evaluation of them 
for cryogenic service is given by Brennan et al. [87]. These flowmeters are generally 
used with moderate flow rates (1 to 10 L/s) and are capable of being operated over a 
5-to-1 flow range. A pressure drop of about 30 kPa is typical with these meters at max­
imum flow. With care, an uncertainty of ±1% is possible. Subcooling the liquid below 
the saturation curve is important to prevent the formation of vapor in the flowmeter. A 
disadvantage of positive displacement flowmeters is that they are subject to wear and 
must be recalibrated periodically.
Temperature pulse flowmeters. Temperature pulse flowmeters measure the transit time 
of a thermal disturbance within a moving fluid. The technique will not work if thermal 
diffusion or turbulence spreads the temperature pulse before it can travel to measurement 
locations. Circuitry is required to detect arrival of the thermal pulses. The transit time of 
a heat pulse can be determined more accurately using cross- or autocorrelation techniques 
[88,89], but many readings must be stored in a computer and manipulated to maximize 
the correlation function. The heat input can also disturb the fluid, especially in a fluid
like He II with high thermal conductivity where large heat inputs are required.
Thrbine flowmeters. Turbine flowmeters consist of a freely rotating bladed rotor sup­
ported by bearings inside a housing. An electrical transducer senses rotor speed, which 
is a direct function of flow velocity. Turbine flowmeters are used mostly for liquid flows 
and have a useful range of at least 10 to 1. Calibrations with liquid cryogens may dif­
fer from water calibrations by up to ±2% [90]. They are susceptible to errors caused 
by upstream swirl, and therefore some means of flow straightening is usually required 

CRYOGENIC INSTRUMENTATION 245
for accurate measurements. An evaluation of several cryogenic turbine flowmeters was
reported by Brennan et al. [91]. They ranged in size from 32 to 51 mm with maxi­
mum flow rates between 5 and f4 L/s. Maximum pressure drops ranged from 20 to 
100 kPa. Flow measurement uncertainties were generally less than ± 1 %. A commercial 
turbine flowmeter with ball bearings and a bore diameter of 9.35 mm has even been used 
for measuring flow in normal and superfluid helium with flow rates between 0.01 and 
0.3 L/s [92], The meter output was about 0.5% higher for superfluid helium compared 
with normal helium. Avoidance of cavitation is important in superfluid helium. Kashani 
[93] used a Model MF20 Sponsler turbine flowmeter in He II, although it did not register 
a reading for low flows, a common problem with turbine flowmeters. A custom-made 
turbine flowmeter with magnetic bearings has also been used for liquid helium flow by
Rivetti et al. [94]. Short-term repeatability of ±0.5% was reported for the magnetic- 
bearing flowmeter. Turbine flowmeters require low bearing friction for successful op­
eration. To ensure this, the liquid must be free of solid particles such as frozen air or 
water. An upstream filter is often used. Like other flowmeters with moving parts, turbine 
flowmeters have a limited lifetime. Jewel bearings should be qualified for cryogenic ser­
vice by dunking in liquid nitrogen—those with internal stresses or severe defects will fail 
under the thermal shock. Other models use austenitic stainless steel ball bearings. Tur­
bine flowmeter response times in the range of 1 to 10 ms have been reported by Alspach 
and Flynn [90], depending on blade angle, flowmeter size, and flow rate. These authors 
also reported the successful use of turbine meters in reverse flow, allowing them to be 
used in oscillating flows with frequencies less than about I to 10 Hz.
4-5-3 Differential Pressure Flowmeters
The differential pressure flowmeter can be used with either as or liquid flows. They
a
operate on the principle that the pressure drop across some flow element is a function of
the flow rate. These meters can be used at cryogenic temperatures if the pressure sensor 
is located at ambient temperature or if a cryogenic pressure sensor is used. They have
no moving parts and can be highly reliable.
Orifice plate flowmeters. The most common type of flow element is the sharp-edged 
orifice plate. Usually the orifice plate is designed for flow in one direction with the sharp 
edge of the orifice on the entrance side. Symmetric orifice plates have been used by 
Radebaugh and Rawlins to measure oscillating flows [81].
The relation between the mass flow rate and the pressure drop AP across the orifice 
is given by
m = CoAo[2p AP/(1 -£4)]l/2
(4-12)
where Co is the orifice or discharge coefficient (~0.6), Ao is the cross sectional area 
of the orifice, p is the fluid density and ft is the ratio of the orifice diameter to the 
tube inside diameter. Because the mass flow is proportional to the square root of AP, 
a range of 10 in A P yields a range of only 3 in mass flow. The resulting small range 
of operation is a disadvantage of the orifice meter. The orifice coefficient determined 
from a water calibration can be used for most liquid cryogens with ±2% uncertainty

differential pressure ports.
according to Brennan et al. [75]. The uncertainty for use with gas can be somewhat 
higher. Obtaining high accuracy with these meters requires a straight length of tube 
upstream of the orifice that is at least 20 times the tube diameter and a length of at least 
5 tube diameters downstream. Alternatively, flow straighteners in the form of tube bundles 
can be used if length is restricted. The simple design of orifice plate flowmeters allows 
them to be scaled up or down to accommodate a very wide range of flow rates. Pressure 
drops can be made quite small, although for AP less than about 1 % of the mean pressure, 
the signal-to-noise ratio may be too small to be easily measured. A disadvantage of the 
orifice meter is the large amount of turbulence created by the flow through the orifice.
Venturi flowmeters. Turbulence and pressure drop are reduced by using a venturi device 
as the flow element (see Fig. 4-15). The throat diameter is usually about one-half the tube 
diameter. The flow rate through the venturi meter is governed by the same relationship
as for the orifice meter, but the discharge coefficient is near unity, thus reducin the
pressure drop by about 60% for the same mass flow. Venturi meters have been used 
in many applications for measuring flow rates of normal, supercritical, and superfluid 
helium [92,95], Short-term repeatability of ±0.5% was reported. Discharge coefficients 
varied by about 3% over a flow range of 10-to-l and for temperatures between 1.7 and 
4.2 K. The design requirements of the venturi flowmeter prevent it from being used for 
reverse flow.
Laminar flow elements. Laminar flow elements are a third type of differential pres­
sure flowmeter. The laminar flow element gives rise to a linear relationship between 
mass-flow rate and pressure drop. As a result, it can be used over a wider range of flow 
rates than can the orifice meter and the venturi meter. The governing equation is
V = 
= kP/pLZf 
(4-13)
4
where V is the volumetric flow rate, /x is the viscosity, and Zf is the flow impedance of 
the laminar element. For laminar flow in a gap, the flow impedance is given by 
*
Zf=l2L/wt3 
(4-14)

CRYOGENIC INSTRUMENTATION 247
where L is the length of the gap, w is the width of the gap, and Ms the thickness of the gap. 
Eq. (4-13) shows that the laminar flow element is intrinsically a volumetric flowmeter. 
The gap thickness must be sufficiently small to prevent turbulent flow. As an example, for 
helium gas with amass flow rate of 1 g/s, P=2MPa, £=1 cm, and AP= 20 kPa, the gap 
thickness must be less than 34 ^.m at 80 K and less than 9.8 ^im at 10 K. The gap width 
must be 116 mm at 80 K and 240 mm at 10 K. Even though the overall gap width can be 
achieved with many parallel gaps, the outside dimensions of the laminar flow element 
will be relatively large. The small gap thickness at cryogenic temperatures makes the 
laminar flow element difficult to fabricate. No commercial laminar flow elements are 
available for cryogenic use. A custom-made device has been used with some success 
by Radebuagh and Rawlins [80] to measure oscillating mass-flow rate at about 10 K in 
high-pressure helium gas.
4-6 LIQUID LEVEL MEASUREMENT
The quantity of interest for liquid level measurements can be either the position of the 
liquid surface or the total quantity of liquid present (mass or volume). Often one can 
be inferred from the other. The mass can be measured by weighing the entire container 
if (1) the empty weight is known accurately, (2) the mass of the liquid is a significant 
fraction of the total, and (3) the forces from pipes, cables, and other connections to the 
container are negligible.
Floats are only rarely used in cryogenic liquids because of low densities and problems 
with moving parts in cryogenic environments, especially where icing is possible.
The hydrostatic pressure difference between the bottom and top of a liquid is pro­
portional to the liquid depth and is commonly used with large tanks or denser cryogens. 
Measurement of the hydrostatic pressure difference requires either two pressure sensors, 
one in the vapor and one at the bottom of the liquid, or a differential pressure sensor and 
some way to keep the pressure tap to the bottom filled with vapor. Bubblers work when a 
source of noncondensable gas is available, but using a source of heat to boil off some of the 
liquid is more common with cryogens. Capacitance level sensors are made with wire-in- 
tube or tube-in-tube geometries. The liquid and vapor have different dielectric properties, 
and thus the capacitance is proportional to the liquid level. One drawback is sensitivity 
to ice, which has a large dielectric constant. Commercially available capacitance level 
sensors can be used with most cryogenic liquids.
Detection of the presence or absence of liquid at a point is possible with a temperature- 
sensitive device excited to self-heat significantly. The temperature rise is higher in vapor, 
allowing detection of liquid. Diodes, transistors, or thermistors are frequently used with 
a comparator circuit. Several point sensors can be arrayed to provide a semicontinuous 
indication of level [96].
For continuous readings, a vertical wire of temperature-dependent material can be 
used with heat provided by the excitation current or by a parallel heater wire. These 
level sensors are sensitive to the temperature of the vapor and tend to be inaccurate with 
large temperature gradients found in containers with low thermal conductivity walls and 
during transients such as filling.

248 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
Superconductive level sensors consist of a wire or thin rod of material that is super­
conducting at the liquid temperature. A small heat input either at the top end or along the 
length of the sensor warms any of the wire in vapor above the superconducting to nor­
mal transition temperature, making it electrically resistive. The sensitivity to variations 
in vapor temperature is greatly reduced. Several manufacturers make superconductive 
liquid helium level sensors using NbTi filaments, typically 30 to 100/xm in diameter. 
Operation is unaffected by magnetic fields to at least 5 T. The liquid temperature can 
vary from about 4.5 down to at least 1.2 K. Superconductive level sensors with an effec­
tive resistance greater than about 4.3 Q/cm have a “blind spot1’just above the lambda 
temperature (2.17 K) where the indicated liquid level suddenly drops to zero. The peak 
nucleate boiling heat flux is depressed in this region, and the liquid level will remain zero 
until the liquid temperature cools below 2.17 K or warms enough to reestablish nucleate 
boiling along the submerged portion of the filament. Superconductive level sensors for 
liquid nitrogen, oxygen, or argon could in principle be made using high-temperature su­
perconductors, but technical problems and the availability of many workable alternatives 
have limited their usefulness.
Liquid level control systems of the following several types have been developed: 
(I) timer with no sensors, (2) on-off solenoid controlled by one or two point sensors 
(97], (3) on-off solenoid controlled by a continuous sensor, and (4) proportional control 
systems [98].
4-7 MAGNETIC MEASUREMENTS
Several magnetic field-dependent properties can be used to construct magnetic field 
sensors. Unfortunately, many of them are difficult to use in a cryogenic environment.
4-7-1 Hall Effect
Hall effect sensors are commercially available and are the most common way to measure 
magnetic fields. The sensors are based on the Hall effect in which charge carriers moving 
through a material are forced to one side or the other through their interaction with the 
magnetic field. The output voltage difference is directly proportional to the magnetic 
flux passing through the material perpendicular to the plane of the Hall plate. Care must 
be taken to orient the sensor properly, for the output voltage goes as the cosine of the 
angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the Hall plate. In practice, the Hall 
plates are fabricated as a thin sheet of semiconductor material to which four contacts 
are made. Commercial devices are available in relatively small packages for measurin 
either transverse or axial fields. Typical devices are operated at constant currents on the 
order of 1 to 100 mA with the output signal measured by a voltmeter. Sensitivity varies
reatly with model, but the range is from about 10 to 1500 mV/T. The resistance varies 
from about 1 Q to thousands of ohms, and the sensitivity is proportional to the resistance.
Hall sensors designed for cryogenic use have a finite lifetime measured in terms of 
the number of cycles to cryogenic temperatures. Hall sensors are delicate and easily 

CRYOGENIC INSTRUMENTATION 249
damaged. Careful mounting is required to minimize mechanical strains during cool­
down, A typical cryogenic Hall generator will last 50 to 100 thermal cycles. Two failure 
modes occur. The first is a catastrophic failure due to cracking in the Hall sensor itself.
This is most likely to occur during the first few thermal cycles. The second failure mode 
is the result of continued microcracking upon each thermal cycle. The microcrackin
results in an increasin
voltage offset, which eventually becomes too large to cancel out.
The offset voltage for typical Hall generators will increase on the order of 1 gV per 
thermal cycle.
Commercially available Hall sensors arc produced by F. W. Bell (BHT 921), Lake 
Shore Cryotronics (HGCA-3020 and HGCT-3020), and Siemens (RHY 17 and RHY 18). 
Temperature sensitivity is very low with slope changes on the order of ±0.5% between 
4.2 and 300 K. All of these Hall sensors are slightly nonlinear, particularly at fields above 
5 T and temperatures below 10 K, but should be accurate to within ±1 %. Requirements 
for higher accuracy necessitate calibration near the measurement temperature.
4-7-2 Induction Coils
Induction coils rely upon Faraday’s induction law as their working principle. The ma­
jor limitation with these coils is that the magnetic flux through the pickup coil must 
be changing with time to produce an output voltage. Their greatest application is in 
measuring pulsed or ramped fields. Rotating coils are required to measure DC mag­
netic fields. Thermal contraction can change the calibration at cryogenic temperatures. 
Specially shaped coils can be designed to respond preferentially to uniform fields or to 
higher-order components.
4-7-3 Magnetoresistance
Magnetoresistors made from high-purity copper wire have been widely used at low tem­
peratures and in high magnetic fields. The sensor, typically made of coiled wire, must be 
designed and constructed with great care to minimize its size, temperature sensitivity, and 
mechanical strain. The large size of magnetoresistors often limits their usefulness. Semi­
conductors or bismuth crystals can also be used. The temperature dependence of the base 
resistivity is a problem unless the magnetoresistor is calibrated and used at the same tem­
perature. The magnetoresistance increases quadratically at low magnetic fields, making 
measurement of small fields difficult, An accuracy of better than 0.1% is possible in 
magnetic fields greater than 3 T [99]. Magnetoresistance is not direction-dependent in 
most metals, and thus the sensor can not be used to determine field direction.
4-7-4 NMR
The use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) magnetometers to measure magnetic 
fields is well established at room temperature. An atomic nucleus with nonzero spin 
quantum number and magnetic moment absorbs electromagnetic energy at a natural 
resonant frequency proportional to the magnetic field strength. One nucleus used at 

250 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
cryogenic temperatures is 27Al with a gyromagnetic ratio relating resonance frequency 
and magnetic field of 11.094 MHz/T. Nuclear magnetic resonance magnetometers can be 
used for magnetic fields in about the 0.05 to 30 T range, which corresponds to resonance 
frequencies of roughly 0.1 to 100 MHz.
An NMR probe consists of a quantity of an appropriate material containing the 
desired nuclei, coils, and transmission line to the oscillator, typically at ambient tem­
perature. The size of an NMR probe is typically on the order of I cm3. Magnetic field 
uniformity on the order of 0.1% or better over the sample volume is needed. Nuclear 
magnetic resonance is the most accurate method available for measuring magnetic fields. 
Accuracies on the order of 0.001% are possible in very homogeneous fields.
Nuclear magnetic resonance’s advantages of very high accuracy and orientation 
independence can also be exploited at cryogenic temperatures. Although there are not 
as yet any commercially available cryogenic NMR probes, several examples of custom 
probes have been published. Two of the earliest provide details of the probe construction 
and the electronic circuits. Maxfield and Merrill [100] describe a marginal oscillator 
design making use of 27Al nuclei. Finely powdered aluminum is used to reduce eddy 
currents. Rupp [101] describes a crossed coil (transmitter-receiver) circuit used with 
a slurry containing i33Cs and mentions that the water sample typically used in room­
temperature NMR does not work when frozen.
4-7-5 SQUIDs
Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) have the highest sensitivity 
of any magnetic flux sensor with a resolution on the order of a single flux quantum. 
The maximum measurable field is only about 1 /iT The active region is a small ring of 
superconductor broken by one or two weak links (Josephson junctions). The necessity of 
a superconducting material limits the upper temperature range of these devices to about 
100 K. In addition, SQUIDs are extremely sensitive to noise and require sophisticated 
external electronics to operate properly.
4-8 OTHER MEASUREMENTS
Acceleration can be measured with a piezoelectric element. Commercial sources exist 
operational down to the liquid helium temperature range. Amplification is typically 
required and the instrumentation is similar to that described for piezoelectric pressure 
sensors. Extremely sensitive accelerometers can be designed using SQUIDs for 
signal readout [1].
Acoustic emission sensors are sometimes used to monitor cracking or other energy- 
releasing motions, particularly in superconducting magnets where small motions of 
the conductors can lead to quenches. Piezoelectric pressure or acceleration sensors 
are commonly used [2,3].
Chemical composition of cryogenic fluids is important in mixtures. Some examples in­
clude the relative fraction of ortho-to para-hydrogen [4] or of 3He and 4He in a 
dilution refrigerator.

CRYOGENIC INSTRUMENTATION 251
Density is frequently inferred by measurement of the pressure and temperature or mass 
and volume, but other methods are commonly used [5,6]-
Displacement or motion sensors of the resistive or strain gauge type can sometimes be 
operated at cryogenic temperatures [29], Measurement of displacement with a warm 
sensor and a stiff connecting member can be complicated if the temperature along
the length of the member varies with displacement and the thermal contraction is 
significant.
Flow visualization is sometimes used to get information about flowing liquids with min­
imal disturbance. Photography is possible in some cases [7]. Laser holography has 
been used to investigate shock waves in liquid helium [8]. Bubbles and turbulence
can also be monitored by cheaper LED and photodiode circuits [9].
Heat capacity is measured by monitorin
the temperature response to a known heat
input [10,11,12|.The response time and heat capacity of the temperature sensor and 
heater are important.
Heat Flux is commonly measured with two temperature sensors on either side of a 
thermally resistive material. One application is measurement of thermal insulation 
effectiveness.
Leak detection can require special techniques at temperatures below 10 K. Hot cathode
extractor gauges have been found to be reliable for very low pressure measurements 
at liquid helium temperatures [13].
Quench detection in superconducting magnets is commonly accomplished by measur­
ing and comparin
the voltages across various sections of the magnet winding [29].
Voltages from different sections are combined to eliminate the inductive component 
of the voltage and yield only the resistive voltage drop. The resistive voltage is zero 
when the winding is in the superconducting state but becomes finite and grows if a 
normal zone appears. Quick response is frequently required.
Void fraction in cryogenic fluids has been measured by using the difference between liq­
uid and vapor dielectric constants. A concentric capacitance sensor has been used 
to measure quality of helium flows with an accuracy of 1 % even though the liquid 
and vapor dielectric constants differ by only 4% [14].

5-1 INTRODUCTION
A cryostat is a device in which something is to be done at a controlled low temperature. 
It may be as simple as a container (Dewar) to hold a liquid cryogen that surrounds a 
superconducting magnet or very complex assemblies for high-energy physics or multi­
layer insulation (MLI) thermal conductivity measurements.
The initial design task is to determine just what function the cryostat is to perform 
and what are the driving factors (including the project budget). Typical considerations 
include the following:
1. Personnel and facility safety requirements and relevant codes.
2. Facility constraints.
3. Service conditions, including g loads and environmental exposure.
4. Required size and orientation of the cryostat.
5. Refrigeration source and temperature.
6. Requirements for periodic accessibility.
7. Lifetime (quick and dirty or for permanent service).
8. Necessary instrumentation and controls.
Special features such as bakeability, high-pressure containment, temperatures below 
2.17 K, presence of high magnetic fields, vibration isolation, and provisions for 
combustible materials, including the cryogens themselves.
10. Level of usage rangin
from continuous to infrequent.
11. Services required, including power, cryogens, air, and cooling water.

260 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
These typical guidelines may seem obvious, but some may be overlooked in the pressure 
to get a project started. To do so may be costly in time and money. The best approach 
is first to design the experiment or process and then build the cryostat around it.
5-2 MATERIALS
Present-day cryostat designers are fortunate in comparison with their predecessors in 
that there are more choices of materials to use, and better physical and thermal property 
values are available for them than previously. This improves design accuracy and equip­
ment reliability. The following are properties of greatest interest for cryogenic structural 
applications:
• Warm and cold tensile and yield strengths
Impact strength at design temperature
• Tensile and shear moduli
• Thermal conductivity
• Surface emissivity
• Vacuum characteristics
• Methods of fabrication and joining
Some of the most useful cryogenic structural materials are described in the sections that 
follow.
5-2-1 Austenitic Stainless Steels: Types 304, 304L, 304N, 
316,316L, and 321
Austenitic stainless steels are the workhorse materials for cryogenics over all temperature 
ranges. They are readily available in a variety of forms, have good impact strengths, are 
easily welded vacuum tight, and have a moderately high tensile modulus (~200 GPa), 
an ASME Code [1] design strength of 129.6 MPa al room temperature, and thermal 
conductivity [2] ranging from 14.7 W/mK at 300 K to 7.9 W/mK at 77 K to 0.28 W/mK 
at 4 K. These 300-series stainless steels are reasonably clean with respect to surface 
outgassing, are readily baked out, and have less diffused hydrogen than typical carbon 
steel. One caveat is that stainless steel bars sometime have axial inclusions that leak 
slowly or not at all at ambient temperature but may exhibit profuse vacuum leak rates 
at cryogenic temperatures. Also, very high tensile and yield strengths are obtained from 
cold-worked 300-series stainless steel machined parts and cables, but these improved 
properties are lost by the annealing effect of welding or brazing.
5-2-2 Nickel Steels: Primarily 9% Nickel Steel
Nickel steel is limited to uses at 77 K and higher temperatures. The ASME Code allowable 
stress for 9% nickel steel is 26.6% greater than for 304 stainless steel, and nickel steel 
is somewhat less expensive. Thus, it is widely used in large industrial gas containers in 

CRYOSTAT DESIGN 261
which the inner shell material is the largest cost. Nine-percent nickel steel is seldom 
used in laboratory-sized cryostats.
5-2-3 Aluminum Alloys: Alloys 1100,3003, 6061, 6063, and 5083
Aluminum alloys are used for inner vessels (particularly 6061 and 5083), in heat­
conductin
and 6061).
baffles and shields (1100 and 3003), and in extrusions and piping (6063
Aluminum is characterized by light weight (2768 kg/m3), relatively high
thermal conductivity (1100 and 6063), moderate allowable design stress (68 to 70 MPa 
for 6061 and 5083), and a low average modulus of 69 GPa. Aluminum alloys are clean in 
vacuum service and have a low rate of hydrogen diffusion. Clean aluminum has low ther­
mal radiation emissivity, typically from 1 to 4 or 5%, depending on surface temperature 
and condition. This makes it effective for radiation shields and foil reflectors in MLI.
5-2-4 Copper: Commercial Alloys CDA 101 (OFHC), 110 (ETP), 
and 120 (Phosphorous Deoxidized)
High-purity copper alloys have high thermal conductivity and low radiation emissivity. 
Copper is typically fabricated by brazing or soldering, but it can be welded using the 
tungsten inert gas (TIG) process. However, only deoxidized copper should be welded 
to avoid cracking after the first cooldown to low temperature. Copper can also be TIG- 
welded to stainless steel by using Everdur (Cu-95%, Si-4%, and Mn-1%) filler rod. 
Annealed copper must be used in heat transfer applications because even mild cold work 
adversely impacts thermal conductivity.
5-2-5 Fiber-Epoxy Composites: NEMA Grades G-10-CR, 
.G-ll-CR, and Others
Fiber-epoxy composites are strong and light and have low thermal conductivity and 
good vacuum characteristics, although they cannot be baked out at high temperatures.
Standard G-10-CR and G-l 1-CR (and other similar commercial products) have many 
uses as thermally insulating mechanical supports, and tubular forms are vacuum-tight to 
air and nitrogen vapor. (They diffuse helium gas at an unacceptable rate.) With proper 
radial clearance (0.1 to 0.2 mm), G-10 and G-l 1 make vacuum-tight epoxy joints with 
stainless steel that withstand cold cycling to 77 K and lower. However, like G-l0/11 
in layer-to-layer shear, the major problem of joining composites to metals is that the 
epoxy joints are much less strong than either material. This can be overcome by filament 
winding the composite into straps or trunnions that are mechanically locked into end 
spools or hubs. Filament winding offers other options in that a variety of fibers can be 
selected to enhance tensile and compressive strengths, improve fatigue life, and match 
the modulus or expansion coefficient of metals. The most common filament is E-glass 
followed by S-glass, which is considerably stronger. Kevlar fiber is widely used in body 
armor and has some cryogenic applications. Carbon fiber composites are very strong and 
can be formulated for tensile modulus values as high or higher than that of 304 stainless 
steel. Carbon fiber composites have lower thermal conductivity [3] than similar S-glass 

262 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
material below 60 K but substantially higher values at higher temperatures. Alumina fiber
composite straps have been used as spacecraft cryogenic supports [4] based on superior
fatigue life at high stress with strength and heat leak competitive with S-glass composite.
5-2-6 Other Structural Materials: Titanium, Invar,
Maraging Steels, Hastelloy Alloys
Although not commonly used in industry or for cryostat construction, there are several 
materials with special properties that are useful for aerospace and cryostat construc­
tion. These include titanium alloys, Invar, maraging steels, including 17-4PH, and the 
Hastelloy family of high-strength alloys. Titanium alloys, particularly Ti-6A1-4V and Ti- , 
5Al-2.5Sn, are lighter than stainless steel and very strong. Extra low interstitials grades 
are recommended for cryogenic applications, and decreasing low-temperature fracture 
toughness below 125K limits the range of use. However, machined and heat-treated 
Ti-5Al-2.5Sn rods have been in successful use as tension supports for helium Dewars 
for more than 30 years.
Invar, 64.5% Fe-35.5% Ni, is useful because it has a lower coefficient of expansion, 
a, than most metals. The integrated o' from 300 to 70 K is approximately —40 x 10-5 m/m 
and essentially zero below 70 K. In comparison, the a for 304 stainless steel from 300 
down to 20 K is —310 x 10”5 m/m Low shrinkage of Invar gives rise to two useful 
applications. First, it is frequently used in transfer lines to reduce (but not eliminate) 
the number of expansion joints or bend loops required to keep shrinkage stress at an 
acceptable level. Second, Invar washers can be incorporated into bolted flange joints so 
as to make them tighten when cooled. This arrangement is illustrated in Fig. 5-1. As 
shown, an aluminum flange, a = —430 x 10-5 m/m, is bolted to a 304 stainless steel 
flange with high strength stainless steel bolts using an Invar washer. To make the joint 
tighten when cooled from ambient temperature to 4 K, the bolt must shrink more than the 
sandwich of aluminum, stainless steel, and Invar. The basic equation for this situation is
LAaA + 
+ Xoq = (La + Ls 4- X)(aA - e)
(5-1)
where
aA = temperature expansion coefficient for aluminum
0's — temperature expansion coefficient for stainless steel
Qfi = temperature expansion coefficient for Invar
LA = thickness of aluminum flange
Ls = thickness of stainless steel flange
X = required thickness of Invar washer
e = unit strain of bolts due to cooldown (m/m)
This equation may be rearranged as follows to solve for the required Invar thickness X:
X — [Ia(^A “ t*s)  + ^(^A + 
)]/(«S — — Qfl)
(5-2)
“Additional information on composite materials may be found m chapter 2 of this handbook.

CRYOSTAT DESIGN 263
Figure 5-1 Range joint with Invar washer.
For a strain value of 3 x 10 5 m/m and a values as listed above, thickness of the Invar 
washer is 0.472 unit for unit thickness aluminum and stainless steel flanges. The 
3 x 10~5 m/m strain value is equivalent to a bolt stress increase of approximately 6 MPa 
(870 psi). For zero increase in strain, the Invar washer thickness is 0.444 unit.
Heat-treated maragina steels, particularly 17-4PH, are useful for cryogenic pins
and bolts. Aside from havin
high strength at low temperature, the surface hardness
of 17-4PH allows sliding contact with stainless steel and reduced chances of galling, 
especially if the rubbing surfaces are precoated with dry graphite film lubricant. The 
17-4PH pins have been successfully used on 30,000-gal liquid oxygen Dewar sup­
ports where one end was fixed and the other was required to slide some 45 mm during 
cooldown.
High-alloy steels made by Haynes International, notably Hastelloy B and Haynes
alloy No. 25, have excellent structural properties. Compared with 304 stainless steel, 
they are about 50% stronger and have high-impact strengths, good ductility, and 25% 
lower thermal conductivity. Mechanical properties are substantially enhanced by cold 
work. Low-loss Dewar neck tubes have been made in production quantities using 
0.2-mm (0.008-in.) Hastelloy B, and improved units were made from thicker tubes that 
were cold reduced away from the ends. Leaving the ends without cold work improves 
weldability and lowers maximum bending stress in addition to reducing conduction heat 
leak in the center section.
5-3 COLD SEALS
It is frequently necessary to design cryostats with cold seals either because the use 
pattern may require frequent disassembly or because adjacent materials cannot be joined 

264 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
by conventional techniques. Several methods have been found to yield reliable results, 
but all of them require careful design and fabrication to achieve leak tightness. In all 
cases, the sealing surfaces must fit well and have a minimum of waviness. Bolting needs 
special consideration as well. Bolts need to be strong enough to maintain necessary 
clamping forces and be closely spaced to prevent intermediate gaps, and the quotient of 
stress divided by modulus must be low enough to limit bolt stretch. A typical design goal 
for total bolt stretch is 0.013 mm (0.0005 in.). (The Invar washer technique described in 
section 5-2-6 is particularly helpful in cold seal applications.)
Five successful techniques are discussed in the following paragraphs and four of 
them are illustrated in Fig. 5-2.
A number of manufacturers offer bakeable vacuum flanges utilizing a soft copper 
gasket that yields to sharp concentric rings machined into the mating stainless steel 
flanges. This seal is illustrated in Fig. 5-2(a). The copper gaskets can be replaced with 
other soft metals in some applications, particularly if bakeout is not required. These 
seals are satisfactory for low-temperature service but they must be made up carefully. 
Repeated high-torque tightening is required to yield the sealing rings fully on the copper 
gasket and to load the bolts adequately. Because they are primarily aimed at vacuum 
service, these joints are not reliable for high pressures.
Figure 5-2(b) shows a cold seal using indium metal as the sealing agent. As shown, 
a small 60° vee groove is overfilled with an indium wire having a cross-sectional area at 
least 50% greater than that of the groove. When compressed, the groove is completely 
filled with indium, and the excess extrudes on either side. Low bolting force is required 
to make the seal because the indium is very soft. However, strong, high-modulus bolts 
are required to maintain the seal under pressure because the compressed indium has little 
elasticity. Indium seals are particularly effective with soft flanges and materials that are 
not readily joined, such as quartz windows on aluminum ports. Invar washers are helpful 
in this application if high pressures are involved but are otherwise not needed because 
quartz has an even lower coefficient of thermal expansion than Invar.
Metal O-rings with a “C" cross section are commercially produced for low- 
temperature sealing. These typically are plated with silver or copper on the bearing 
surfaces to improve conformance with the mating flanges. As shown in Fig. 5-2(c), the 
open end of the “C” faces inward on these rings so that internal pressure increases the 
flange sealing forces. Metal O-rings are reportedly reusable if the mating surfaces are 
well finished.
An inexpensive cold seal shown in Fig. 5-2(d) was developed at the National Bureau 
of Standards Cryogenic Engineering Laboratory [5] (currently the National Institute of 
Science and Technology) in 1960. This simple seal requires a flat Mylar gasket 0.254 mm 
(0.010 in.) thick that is locally compressed by about 80% to a minimum thickness of 
0.0508 mm by a raised ring machined in the mating flange. The raised ring has a generally 
circular profile with a height of 0.2032 mm and radial width of about 4 mm. (A smaller 
radial width of the raised ring decreases bolting force but increases the chance that the 
gasket will be cut when initially compressed.) This joint requires moderate bolting force 
but can tolerate bolt stretch of no more than 0.010 mm (0.0004 in.). These seals have 
been used in long-term service on 20-K, 7-bar manhole covers and to seal 20-bar quartz 
windows at 77 K.

A variety of special seals have been fabricated based on volume compression of
elastomers. This has typically been accomplished by using a tongue and
•■Jroove arrange­
ment to capture the glass-reinforced Teflon elastomer. Close-tolerance machining of the 
tongue with sharp outer edges to prevent elastomer extrusion out of the groove is the key 
to success with these joints. Unlike the high-squeeze gasket described above, only 1-to- 
5% volume compression is required to make the tongue and groove joints, but relatively 
high bolting forces are needed.

5-4 CRYOSTAT AND DEWAR SUPPORTS
Cryostat supports range from a single cryogen neck tube to an array of composite straps, 
depending on the service conditions. In almost every case, the objective is to support 
the cold inner assembly throughout the range of projected shipping and operating loads 
with an acceptable heat leak. Because of cost and handling considerations, acceptable 
heat leak is frequently a compromise and not the minimum attainable. Thus, any gener­
alization about support designs is subject to specific case exceptions. With this in mind, 
the following support guidelines are suggested:
1. Use tension supports whenever they are feasible.
2. Factor shrinkage of the supports and internal structure into the design.
3. Use Belleville springs to accommodate shrinkage when possible.
4. Minimize multilayer insulation (MLI) penetrations.
5. Use simple welded assemblies pf 304 stainless steel tubes or rods where possible.
Support materials can be ranked in order of cost and heat leak, which are generally 
parallel. Welded assemblies of stainless steel tubes or rods are usually low in cost and can 
be arranged for quite low heat leak if there is room for substantial thermal lengths. Higher 
performance with the same configurations can be achieved by using more expensive high- 
alloy steels or titanium alloy rods. Saddles, discs, and structural members made of G-10 
or G-l 1 are also inexpensive and can be arranged for moderate heat leaks, particularly 
for large industrial gas containers.
Stainless steel cables are useful for supporting Dewars and cryostats. Cable heat 
leaks are lower than stainless steel rods or tubes because wires in the cables are cold- 
worked to ultimate stress levels about twice that of annealed material. Cable installation 
is convenient because assemblies can be purchased with commercial end fittings that do 
not require welding.
High-performance supports can be made of filament-wound composites formed into 
straps or trunnions. These have the highest strength-to-heat leak ratio and are generally 
most expensive. Straps can be made as strong as desired, but care must be taken to 
use a generous spool radius at each end to avoid stress concentrations [6]. Also, special 
winding procedures must be used to avoid uneven filament loads if heat-stationing copper 
foils are incorporated into the windings. Curing filament-wound straps under modest 
tension helps to distribute tension loads evenly. Trunnions [7] are an established method 
of supporting large Dewars or cryostats insulated with MLI. They can be filament-wound 
to support any size and mass of container or cryostat for static or mobile use. Trunnion 
heat leaks are low compared with metal supports, but costs are relatively high because 
large, rigid hubs are required at each end and special techniques must be utilized to lock 
the windings to them.
Heat stationing of supports is quite beneficial in reducing heat leaks. Heat stationing 
should be done at every temperature level where refrigeration is available and partic­
ularly at 77 K and colder. Two or three intercepts should be used for systems cooled 
by flow of helium vapor. Design of heat intercepts must reflect the thermal properties 
of the support to be effective. Thin metal supports need little more than a copper wire 

268 HANDBOOK OP CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
soldered or brazed to the surface, but thick composite straps or trunnions need inter­
cepts of substantial length to be really effective. Intercept lengths may range from four 
to six times the composite thickness for cooling from one side. Finite-element heat 
transfer calculations are a good way to evaluate support heat intercepts on composite 
material.
5-5 HELIUM CRYOSTAT AND DEWAR DESIGN 
WITH VAPOR-COOLED SHIELDS
Because of helium’s very high ratio of vapor enthalpy to latent heat of vaporization, 
low-loss helium cryostats and Dewars can be designed that perform well without use 
of auxiliary refrigerants. With a computer and suitable software, the procedure is sur­
prisingly easy. That the specific heat of helium vapor at low pressure is nearly constant 
from 15 to 300 K makes these calculations possible without use of available [8] inter­
active helium data. The primary task is to assemble all of the requisite geometric data 
between each shell and shield. These data include the insulation area and thickness on 
each shield and the inner container surface and the cross-sectional area and length of the 
supports and piping for each relevant temperature increment. In the conventional itera­
tive method, temperatures are assumed for each shield, and heat balances are written for 
each of them and the inner container. Then, thermal conductivity integrals are applied 
to each mode of heat transfer to see if balances are obtained. This labor can be avoided 
if equations are written for the thermal conductivity integrals and each heat balance set 
up with shield temperature as a variable. The following equations are representative 
curve-fit relations forMLI, 304 stainless steel, and filament-wound glass-epoxy. Defi­
nite integrals of these equations between variable or fixed cold and warm temperatures 
provide interactive values for solving heat balances in terms of the unknown shield 
temperature.
MLI thermal conductivity (W/mK):
k = (1.2054 + (3.777 x 10"2)T
+ (1.4438 x 1O“5)T2 + (9.5682 x 10“6)r3) x 10-6 
(5-3)
304 stainless steel (W/mK):
k = [(1.3449 x 10"')T - (5.2208 x 10"4)T2 + (7.8902 x 1O“7)T3] x 10-6 (5-4)
Filament-wound glass epoxy (in direction of filaments, W/mK): 
*
k = [7.006 x 10~7 + (3.2815 x 10-3)T - (5.6717 x IO-6)?2
+ (3.4451 x 10“9)T3] x 10~6 
(5-5)
When set up properly, the heat balance equations will solve for the temperature of 
each shield and the rate of cooling vapor flow, which is, of course, related to the helium 
heat leak. The heat balance around the liquid helium container must be set up to allow 
for retained vapor, which reduces the mass flow of vent gas available for cooling. This 
fraction is 0.865 at 101.325 kPa and decreases as the helium reservoir pressure increases 

CRYOSTAT DESIGN 269
above atmospheric. Although there are a number of computer software packages that will 
solve the related simultaneous equations, TK Solver provides an almost instant solution 
once the equations are correctly set up.
Spacing of vapor or liquid cooling lines on shields is frequently a matter of con­
jecture. This design problem can be solved accurately using an analytically derived 
equation. Consider a shield of thickness t, temperature T, and thermal conductivity k 
at T on which the average heat transfer load is q W/nr. The cooling tubes or passages 
are separated by a distance of 2L m so that the maximum heat conduction length is L m. 
The AT between any point in the shield and the cooling tube is given by
AT = qL2/2kt 
(5-6)
For a
iven acceptable AT value, Eq. (5-6) can be solved for the corresponding
value of L, which is half of the maximum cooling passage spacing. Unsatisfactory 
combinations of L and AT can be altered by changing the shield thickness t and, in some
instances, the shield material may be changed to obtain higher thermal conductivity k. 
The most common result of this calculation is that cooling tube spacing can be greater
than generally assumed.
5-6 VACUUM-JACKETED TRANSFER LINE DESIGN
Vacuum-jacketed (V J) transfer lines are a necessary utility for all aspects of cryogenics. 
Applications range from tonnage air separation plants to circulation of superfluid helium 
in orbiting satellites. In each case, the conceptual elements are the same:
1. A suitable pipe or passage is needed for the cryogen.
2. The cold pipe must have a highly reflective surface, be wrapped with MLI to limit 
heat leak, or both.
3. Low;heat-leak supports or spacers are needed to separate the cold pipe from the warm 
vacuum jacket.
4. There must be a vacuum-tight jacket around the inner assembly.
5. Expansion joints on either the inner or outer lines are required to compensate for 
differential thermal shrinkage.
6. Vacuum-jacketed pipe ends must be provided with low-heat-leak end pieces to join 
pipe sections together and to connect with Dewars.
7. Vacuum valves must be provided to evacuate line sections, sometimes in conjunction 
with vacuum gauge tubes.
8. Warm and cold getters are required to preserve the static vacuum in the line.
Conventional pressure drop and internal pressure requirements govern the size and 
thickness of the inner pipe, and it must be compatible with the cryogen being transferred. 
Pipe and tube made of 304 stainless steel is the most common material. In most cases, 
the flow work [ 
= (mass flow rate)(AP)/(density)] resulting from pressure drop
is not significant, but, for pressure transfer, higher AP implies a higher supply Dewar 
pressure, which causes higher flash losses for initially saturated liquid. Therefore, within 

270 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
the constraints of cost, it is generally desirable to size the inner line for low-pressure 
drop transfer.
In a well-designed transfer line, most of the heat leak is by radiation or insulation 
conduction from the vacuum jacket to the inner pipe. Limiting this heat transfer is 
of primary importance. This can be accomplished with low emissivities on the facing 
surfaces or by imposing concentrically wrapped MLI on the inner pipe. Generally, using 
insulation is more economical than specially prepared surfaces unless very small radial 
clearances are necessary. The MLI must be put on one layer at a time because continuous 
wrapping results in a helical heat-flow path in the reflector material. This is especially 
damaging if aluminum foil is the reflector. Ten layers of MLI are usually sufficient for 
liquid nitrogen and other industrial gas lines. Twenty to forty layers may be cost-effective 
on hydrogen and helium lines.
Liquid helium lines that are in heavy or continuous use may employ traced construc­
tion. Traced lines have a copper or aluminum shield tube surrounding the helium line 
with a liquid nitrogen line running along its external surface or integral with it in the case 
of specially made aluminum extrusions. Typical copper trace lines are 6.35 to 9.53 mm 
(1/4 or 3/8 in.) outer diameter, which is sufficient for the small flow of liquid nitrogen 
required to maintain the shield tube at approximately 78 K. The trace tube is usually 
soft-soldered to the shield tube to assure good thermal contact. Spacers are required to 
keep the liquid helium line from touching the shield, but insulation is not normally used 
because radiation heat transfer between 4.2 and 78 K is comparable to that of typical 
MLI. The annular space between the shield and vacuum jacket is wrapped with MLI to 
limit the trace nitrogen heat load.
Transfer line spacers perform two essential tasks. On straight pipe runs they provide 
low-hcat-leak separation between the cryogen line and vacuum jacket. Except for large 
lines, little strength and heat leak are required for this function. However, if lines have 
elbows and tees, as is frequently the case, spacers must react against substantial lateral 
loads to prevent cold shorts. These spacers must have substantial mechanical strength and 
low heat leak in a limited radial dimension. A great variety of materials and configurations 
have been used to meet these goals. These include G-10 and G-l 1 in sheet and tubular 
form, fiberglass-filled Teflon sheet, laced polyester cord "bicycle wheels,” twisted strips 
of polyethylene, and simple polyester cord with closely spaced knots. Typical transfer 
line spacer configurations are shown in Fig. 5-3(a-d).
Selection criteria for transfer line vacuum jacket material are driven by cost, ease of 
fabrication, and the combination of low outgassing and low rate of hydrogen diffusion. 
The material of choice is 304 stainless steel because it ranks high in all three categories. 
Copper is a distant second choice because it has low emissivity and low outgassing. 
Carbon steel pipe is used occasionally, particularly with large, perlite-insulated lines 
that may be continuously evacuated.
On every transfer line cooldown cycle, the inner line tends to shrink to its unstrained 
length at the cryogen temperature whereas the vacuum jacket stays at substantially its 
ambient length. Aside from mechanical failure, three alternatives are presented:
1. The inner line can include bellows sections that allow shrinkage.
2. Expansion bellows can be placed on the vacuum jacket so that it can move with the 
inner line shrinkage.

CRYOSTAT DESIGN 271
3. The line can be formed with right-angle bends or combinations of bends to form
expansion loops.
No single approach is right for all cases, Each has its advantages and disadvantages,
as discussed in the following paragraphs.
Adding expansion bellows to the inner line is probably the least expensive solution. 
It minimizes end anchor and support problems because the line as a whole does not 
move. Vacuum-jacketed lines with internal bellows are durable because the expansion

joints are not exposed to external damage or to internal corrosion if they are properly 
purged when not in use. The bad.news is that highly flexible bellows sections can only 
tolerate limited internal pressure before failing by “squirm." A squirm-resistant internal 
expansion joint is shown in Fig. 5-4. As shown, the bellows section is almost completely 
guided by the inner flow pipe, and centering is maintained by support spacers on each 
end. Guide pipes inside the bellows have closely spaced bleed holes to allow solvent 
cleaning and thorough purging to prevent trapped contaminants.
Vacuum-jacketed lines with expansion bellows on the vacuum jacket are easily 
cleaned and can be designed for any appropriate working pressure. Negatives include 
possible high-end anchor loads and bellows exposed to mechanical damage and atmo­
spheric corrosion. Both of these problems can be alleviated somewhat if low shrinkage 
Invar pipe is used on the inner line. This reduces the forces to be reacted against at the 
ends and requires fewer expansion joints.
Although frequently not convenient for cryostats, low-temperature contraction prob­
lems can be accommodated by incorporating a series of 90 ° bends and locating the sup­
port spacers to permit the pipe itself to flex. The vacuum jacket must also be designed 
with clearance to allow the inner pipe to move without causing thermal shorts. This 
approach results in durable, high-reliability lines that are particularly appropriate for 
Invar inner line material. Vacuum-jacketed lines for space shuttle launch facilities fall 
into this category.
Flex lines or rigid lines with flex sections are convenient for general-purpose use 
and for connections that must be taken apart with some regularity. Inner line and vacuum 
jacket sections made of annular corrugated stainless steel hose are most commonly used 
for low-pressure flex lines. For higher pressures and to protect from mechanical damage, 
the hose sections may be fitted with external stainless steel braid, which is pulled tight 
and permanently attached at each end. Braided hose is much less flexible than the same 
material without braid. Disadvantages of flex over rigid lines are higher cost, higher heat 
leak, and higher pressure drop for equivalent sizes. Higher cost stems mostly from more 
expensive material with a smaller fraction due to greater labor content.
Line spacers and insulation differences contribute to poorer heat leak of flex lines. 
Insulation heat leak is increased over rigid lines because it is partially compressed in bend 
regions and because the supports, helically counter-wrapped knotted polyester cord, also 
bear on the insulation. Pressure drop is much higher [9] in flex than smooth pipe or tube 
because each annular corrugation acts as an individual orifice. Insulation for flex lines 
and sections must be selected for mechanical durability as well as thermal performance. 
Polyester and polyolefin scrim and double-aluminized Mylar seem to survive this service 
and provide acceptable thermal performance. (Tlie.se materials cannot be baked out at 
temperatures much above 125 °C.)
Vacuum-jacketed lines may be terminated by insertion probes, bayonets, and field 
joints. Vacuum-jacketed insertion piobes (frequently of a U tube configuration) are typ­
ically used to transfer cryogens to or from small Dewars and cryostats. They consist of 
an elongated section of small diameter stainless steel tube that fits into the neck of the 
supply or receiving container. Sealing of the probe is done in a warm area of the va­
cuumjacket with an elastomer compression fitting. The preferred configuration of the

probe-receiving vessel is to locate a ball valve below the elastomer compression fitting. 
The ball valve allows the probe to pass when it is in the open position but maintains a 
gas-tight seal when closed after the probe is removed.
Bayonets are the most widely used method of low-heat-leak connection between VJ 
line sections and with liquid cryogen supply sources or receivers. As shown in Fig. 5-5, 
a bayonet pair consists of an interrupted cryogen line, two thermal isolation tubes, warm 
seal flanges incorporated into the vacuum jacket, and, in some designs, a cold nose seal. 
In concept, liquid cryogen flows through the inner line with minor impact where the line 
is interrupted. The male and female isolator tubes establish a thermal gradient to the 
warm flange with stratified gas in the annular space, which results m heat leak small 
enough to keep the O-nng from freezing. (One might ask, What could be simpler?) 
Actually, bayonets do perform substantially as described if they are oriented no more 
than 45° from vertical with the female half down, pressure is less than 400 to 500 kPa 
(60 to 75 psia), and the pressure is not pulsing.
Special design treatment is required to handle nonideal conditions. In particular, if 
the bayonet pair is oriented horizontally (never orient the male bayonet with its warm 
end down), gas in the annular space between the bayonets will not stratify but will, in­
stead, set up a free-convection pattern. This will freeze the sealing O-nng and cause the 
bayonet joint to fail. A reasonably successful solution to this problem is to fabricate the 
bayonet pair so that the annular clearance is small enough, 0.02 to 0.05 mm, to inhibit free 
convection. Even bayonets of this design sometimes fail at higher pressure, especially 
when it is unsteady or pulsing. A backup for this problem is to design the bayonet flanges 
for high clamping forces and to use metal O-rings or other seals that can withstand low 
temperatures. In light of the preceding discussion, cold nose seals appear to have little re­
deeming value. They impede thorough purging of the transfer line system and contribute 
little to restraining free convection in the annular space between the isolator tubes.
Finally, for permanent VJ line installations, field joints are recommended. They com­
bine the advantages of factory assembly of the major portion of each line and eliminate 
the functional problems of bayonets. Negatives include the necessity for field connec­
tions and the generally lower level of vacuum in the field joint volume. As shown in 
Fig. 5-6, the typical field joint includes a socket weld on the cryogen line between two 
factory-fabricated sections, insertion of a prepumped getter bag on the cold joint after 
leak testing, fitting of prepared insulation batts, positioning and welding of the VJ sleeve, 
and evacuation, which may include activation or insertion of hydrogen getter material. 
Heat leak of well-designed field joints is less than equivalent bayonet pairs, and fluid 
flow characteristics should be the same as other welded pipes.
Aside from the fundamental problems with bayonets, poor vacuum is the largest 
source of transfer line trouble. This stems from poor manufacturing vacuum technology 
in many cases and from inconvenient transfer hnc vacuum configuration. Consider that 
the typical transfer line has a high ratio of surface area to volume and a long pumping 
path with poor conductance, is filled with MLI that cannot properly be baked out, and 
is evacuated through a low-conductance valve and pumping line. Once these problems 
are recognized, positive actions can be taken to produce lines that maintain a good static 
vacuum for a period of several years. These actions should include the following:

1. Use pumpout valves and lines with adequate vacuum conductance.
2. Throughout the pumping cycle, heat the inside and outside of the line to the highest
temperature tolerated by the MLI and spacers (perhaps 125 °C).
3. Speed evacuation by periodically and slowly breaking the vacuum back to dry nitrogen 
gas to accelerate moisture removal.
4. Do not stop pumping until the liquid nitrogen cold trap shows no sign of ice or frost 
when taken apart for inspection and cleaning.
5. Pump the line to a dynamic vacuum in the 10“5 torr range or lower and a 1-hour hot 
static vacuum of no more than 10~3 torr.
6. Make sure that the cold and warm getters are sized for a 5-year life and that they are 
properly activated if required.

REFRIGERANTS FOR NORMAL REFRIGERATION

6-1 INTRODUCTION
In the last few years, the public attention has turned to the field of normal refrigeration as 
a result of new discoveries about the environmental impact of the refrigerants currently 
in use. Normal refrigeration covers the fields of air conditioning, food preservation, 
and industrial refrigeration. For these applications, the temperature ranges from about 
10 to -100 °C and in some cases down to -180 °C (cascade systems). This conventional 
usage is often realized by vapor compression systems.
In this chapter, we talk about refrigerants as the working fluid used in vapor com­
pression refrigerating machines (VCRM). Generally, the name refrigerant is applied to 
all refrigerating systems or heat pumps. We want to distinguish clearly between refrig­
erants and cryogenic fluids. Table 6-1 compares the boiling points of refrigerants and 
cryogenic fluids.
6-2 CLASSIFICATION OF REFRIGERANTS
From the chemical point of view, the refrigerants that we treat in this chapter, can be 
divided into the following different groups:
1. Inorganic compounds
2. Halocarbon compounds
3. Hydrocarbons
6-2-1 General
Each of these substances is characterized by its molecular compound (formula, name) 
and also by a specific refrigerant number (R ...). These numbers are generally used and

For the chlorine-fl uorine derivatives of hydrocarbons, the halogenated hydrocar­
bons, and the hydrocarbons from methane to propane, these numbers come with the 
structural formula in a special pattern. In Table 6-2 these assignments are given for 34 
substances. A more detailed outline is contained in Refs. [1-3J.
In order to cover all refrigerants with this nomenclature, some additional sets are 
designated.
6-2-2 Isomers
A small-letter suffix (a, b,...) marks different isomers. For example, tetrafluoroethane:
/CHF2CHF2 R134
C2H2F4/ 
\CF3CH2F R134a
Two letters are used for propane derivatives, where the first letter characterizes the middle 
group: c-CF2, e-CHF, f-CH2. For example,
R245ca CHF2~CF2--CH2F
R245cb CF3-CF2-CH3
R245ea CHF2-CHF-CHF2
R245eb CF3-CHF-CH2F
R245fa CF3-CH2-CHF2

In Tables 6-3 and 6-4, the capital letter suffix stands for a specified proportion of the 
components. The order of the components obeys the order of the temperature of the 
normal boiling point. The ratios in the tables are mass ratios.
Refrigerant mixtures are normally designed as substitute candidates because the 
CFC and HCFC phaseout has caused a lack of suitable single-fluid refrigerants. For 
practical uses, refrigerant mixtures should behave nearly as pure substances to be handled

and thought of in the traditional manner. The characteristic differences are shown in
Fig. 6-1.
In refrigeration, the normal mixture (as opposed to azeotropes) are called zeotropic
mixtures. For easy handling, a narrow boiling blend is the
oal. The temperature
lide
in the phase transition should be less than about 10 K for a narrow boding mixture. For 
a so-called near-azeotropic mixture, the temperature glide has to be less than about 1 K. 
Tables 6-3 and 6-4 also list the boiling temperature glides of commercial refrigerant 
mixtures.
6-2-4 R5XX: Azeotropic Refrigerant Mixtures
For the benefit of refrigeration applications azeotropic refrigerant mixtures have a min­
imum temperature at the azeotropic point combined with a maximum pressure for 
T =s constant. This is shown in Fig. 6-2 Examples of these mixtures are listed in 
Table 6-5. The numbers in brackets give the mass ratio of the components.

6-3 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF REFRIGERANTS
By the 1980s, scientists noticed the destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer, the pro­
tection shield of the Earth. This destruction is mainly caused by chlorine and bromine 
halocarbons. This discovery convinced the international community to ban the pro­
duction, use, and trade of these chemicals in a special time schedule, which was first 
established in Montreal (Montreal Protocol, 1987) and concretized in following con­
ferences. From the different atmospheric lifetime of the compounds, which may be 
especially high for fully halogenated compounds, and from different high ratios of chlo­
rine, various ultimate dates for banning single components were declared. Nowadays it 
is common to split the halocarbons in groups and to give special abbreviations to these 
groups. In Table 6-6, the international agreements are presented; national regulations 
may be much stronger.
Besides the ozone depletion potential (ODP), some other environmental influences 
have to be named such as the global warming potential (GWP) and new categories like 
acidification potential (AP) and photochemical reactivity (PCR). Another new criterion 
for the valuation of refrigerants is (aquatic) ecotoxicity.

6-4 SELECTION OF REFRIGERANTS
For the purpose of refrigeration, several requirements have to be fulfilled by the refrig­
erant that may be given by the workin
scheme or by the equipment of the refrigerating
machine. Essential demands are as follows:
• Suitable vapor pressure-temperature behavior
• Zero ozone depletion potential
• Low global warming potential
• Nontoxicity
• Nonflammability
• Stability in the refrigerating circuit
• Compatibility with materials and lubricants
• High efficiency

REFRIGERANTS FOR NORMAL REFRIGERATION 285
Because there is not an ideal refrigerant that fulfills all requirements, the engineer will 
have to choose the refrigerant that fulfills the most requirements in his special applica­
tion. In Table 6-2 a summary of the main thermodynamic properties is given for some 
of the frequently used CFC (nowadays forbidden) and HCFC (soon to be forbidden) 
refrigerants, for some traditional inorganic refrigerants, and for some HFC, FC and
HC representatives relevant for refrigeration. More refrigerants and their properties are 
introduced in the literature (4—9).

7-1 INTRODUCTION
Small mechanical cryocooler development has been strongly stimulated over the past 
years by the emergence of specific applications requiring low-temperature operation 
with relatively low cooling power.
Today the main applications for cryocoolers are
• Cryopumping for high and clean vacuum (semiconductor industry, space simulation 
chambers, particle accelerators).
• Cooling of detectors (for example, infrared detectors for Earth observation, night 
vision, and missile guidance as well as gamma ray detectors and bolometers for 
astrophysics).
• Cooling of electronic components (cold amplifiers) or of devices including Supercon­
ducting materials (SQUID, Josephson junctions, high-field magnets).
• Cooling of samples for physicists.
• Cooling of radiation thermal shields and recondensation of boil-off in cryogenic liq­
uid storage tanks or large superconducting magnet cryostats for magnetic resonance 
imaging.
The typical cooling powers of the small cryocooiers devoted to these applications 
range from a few tenths of a watt at 4 K or less to about a few tens of watts at 80 K or more. 
These heat loads are small compared with the large duties required for industrial gas

liquefaction plants, which have driven the development of large refrigerators or liquefiers
based on the Linde—Hampson or Claude processes. Large cold piston or centrifugal 
expanders are commonly used in the Brayton cycles (Claude processes) to achieve a good 
thermodynamical efficiency by isentropic expansion of the cycle fluid with external work 
extraction. These expanders undergo a drastic efficiency decrease when miniaturized.
Thus, the small mechanical cryocoolers are developed on the basis of other cycles such 
as the Stirling, Ericsson (also known as Gifford-McMahon), Joule-Thomson, and, more 
recently, pulse-tube cycles that do not involve such isentropic expanders.
The thermodynamics of these cycles, their practical operation, their main applica­
tions, and present and future developments are discussed in the following sections.
7-2 THERMODYNAMIC CONSIDERATIONS OF CRYOCOOLERS
The purpose of a refrigerator is to extract an amount of heat Qc at a cold temperature Tc. 
This heat load Qc has two contributions: the intrinsic inefficiency of the refrigerator and 
either a parasitic heat input (conduction through mechanical structures, convection due 
to residual gas, thermal radiation from surrounding warm surfaces, etc.) or local heat 
dissipation (electronics, AC losses in a superconductor, etc.).
Thermodynamics tells us that for such an operation, some mechanical work VVC has 
to be transmitted to a fluid following a closed cycle during which the heat load Qc is 
removed at the cold sink temperature Tc, and an amount of heat Q*  = (QC + M4) is 
dissipated at ambient temperature Ta to the surroundings
The efficiency or the energy cost for this operation is commonly measured either by 
the coefficient of performance (COP = Qc/ Wc) or by the specific energy consumption 
(Wc/2c), which depends on the effective cycle followed by the fluid.
7-2-1 Theoretical Reversible Cycles
The maximum value of the COP is obtained in a reversible cycle such as the Carnot cycle, 
which is represented (1 
2 -*  3 -> 4) on a temperature-entropy (T-S) diagram in
Fig. 7-1. In this cycle the heat transfers between the cycle fluid and the heat sinks at Tc 
and Ta are assumed to be reversible and isothermal. The compression and expansion of 
the fluid are supposed to be reversible and adiabatic (i.e., isentropic) transformations.
In the T-S diagram, the reversible specific heat exchanges (q = f T dS) are rep­
resented by the area under the lines figuring the evolution of the fluid. For a reversible 
cyclic operation, the specific work w is represented by the area inside the closed loop of 
the cycle on the T-S diagram. Thus, the maximum COP of a refrigerator operating in a 
reversible way between heat sinks at temperatures Tc and Ta can be written as
COPmax “
(7-1)
Typical values for the maximum achievable COPare given in Table 7-1 for cold sink
temperatures correspondin 
* 
approximately to the liquid nitrogen, hydrogen, or helium
boiling temperatures under normal atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere).

For mechanical coolers designed to operate at a cryogenic temperature (Tc < 100 K), 
it is practically impossible for them to operate following a Carnot cycle. In fact, the 
required pressure ratio would widely exceed the present technological and mechanical 
limitations in compressor technology. As shown in Fig. 7-2, some modifications of the 
basic Carnot cycle allow us to overcome these limitations and yet keep the COP of the 
cycle equal to that of a Carnot cycle, as described hereafter.
To bring the high pressure (point 4on Fig. 7-1 for a Carnot cycle) back to a reasonable 
value, the isentropic compression and expansion in the Carnot cycle are substituted either 
by reversible isochoric evolution (Stirling cycle: 1 —> 2 —> 3' -> 4') or by reversible 
isobaric evolution (Ericsson cycle: I —> 2 —> 3" —> 4").
It is obvious, in Fig. 7-2, that these new cycles allow the extraction at the cold 
( 
2
sink Tc of the same amount of heat TdS = (area under the 1 —► 2 line) as the ori­
ginal Carnot cycle with also the same mechanical work requirement (the area of the 
parallelepipeds representing the various cycles remains constant). Thus, these new 
cycles may theoretically obtain the maximum COP if reversible operation is achieved.
However, a new feature characterizes these cycles. During either the isochoric 
(Stirling) or the isobaric processes (Ericsson) a heat transfer at variable temperature 
between the fluid and the surroundings is required. This heat transfer (J T dS) is repre­
sented on the T-S diagram in Fig. 7-2 by the area under the lines 2 -> 3' or 3" and 4' or 
4" 
1. The heat transfer corresponds to the variation of the energy of the fluid when it
is transferred back and forth between the heat sinks at the temperatures Ta and Tc where

are equal in magnitude and of opposite sign. Practically, when developing a cooler based 
either on the Stirling or Ericsson cycle, it will be possible to use either a counterflow heat 
exchanger (in the case of a continuous flow refrigerator) or a regenerator (in the case 
of an alternate flow refrigerator) to directly (counterflow heat exchanger) or indirectly 
(regenerator) exchange the energy between the fluid flowing from ambient temperature 
to low temperature and the fluid flowing back in the opposite direction.
The development of the small mechanical cryocoolers has been mainly based on 
the technology of the regenerative heat exchangers. These regenerators are generally 
constituted by a porous matrix (metal wire mesh or spheres) that acts like a thermal 
sponge by alternately storing or rejecting heat.

Gifford-McMahon-type cryocooler. A Gifford-McMahon (G-M) cryocooler is de­
signed to allow the gas to follow an isobaric-isothermal Ericsson cycle. The high- and
low-pressure sides of a compressor, in which the
as undergoes an isothermal compres­
sion, are alternately connected via an inlet and an outlet valve to a cylinder in which a 
displacer containing the regenerator can be moved. The valves1 operation is synchro­
nized with the position of the displacer, as shown schematically in Fig. 7-3, and the 
process theoretically operates as follows;
• Phase (1): The displacer is at its lowest position, the outlet valve is closed, and the 
inlet valve is opened. The high-piessure gas fills the regenerator and the space above 
the displacer at room temperature.

Phase (2): The inlet valve is still open, and the displacer moves to its upper position.
The high-pressure
as passes through the regenerator, is cooled down isobarically by
the matrix, and fills the space below the displacer at low temperature.
• Phase (3): The displacer is at its upper position, the inlet valve is closed, and the outlet 
valve is opened. The gas in the regenerator and in the cold space undergoes expansion; 
the cooling effect achieved can be used for refrigeration theoretically assumed to occur
at constant temperature.
• Phase (4): The outlet valve is still open, and the displacer moves back to its lowest po­
sition. The low-pressure gas passes through the regenerator, is warmed up isobarically 
by the matrix, and fills the space above the displacer at room temperature.
A heat exchanger at the exhaust of the compressor is used to reject heat at the 
ambient temperature and theoretically to achieve an isothermal compression.
Stirling-type cryocooler. A Stirlin
cryocooler is designed to allow the gas to follow
an isochoric-isothermal cycle. A typical arrangement is shown in Fig. 7-4. A cylinder 
contains two pistons. The volume between the pistons (working volume) is divided into 
two parts by the regenerator. The compression piston can be moved in the compres­
sion volume, which is kept at ambient temperature by means of a heat exchanger; the
expansion piston can be moved in the expansion volume, which remains at the cooling
temperature. The ideal Stirlin ; cycle can be described as follows:

• Phase (1)—Isothermal Compression: The expansion piston is kept close to the re­
generator. The compression piston is moved to compress the gas isothermally in the
compression volume The compression work wc is transmitted to the gas, and heat qa 
is rejected at ambient temperature.
• Phase (2)—Isochoric Precooling: Both pistons are now moved simultaneously to 
transfer the compressed gas at constant volume through the regenerator from the 
compression volume to the expansion volume , The gas is cooled from the ambient 
temperature to the cooling temperature, transferring heat to the regenerator matrix.
• Phase (3) —Isothermal Expansion: The compression piston is kept close to the regen­
erator. The expansion piston is moved to expand the gas in the expansion volume. 
The expansion work wc is extracted from the gas. The cooling effect qc theoretically 
assumed to occur at constant temperature can be used for refrigeration.
• Phase (4)—Isochoric Reheating: Both pistons are now moved simultaneously to trans­
fer the expanded gas at constant volume through the regenerator from the expansion
volume back to the compression volume. The gas is heated from the cooling temper­
ature to the ambient temperature The heat transferred from the regenerator matrix 
to the gas theoretically equals the heat previously transferred from the gas to the
regenerator.

justable valve without heat (q) or work (ui) exchange with the surroundings is an isen- 
thalpic process. This results from the first principle of thermodynamics for an open 
system:
A/i = w + q = 0
Such an isenthalpic expansion process is referred as a Joule-Thomson (J-T) 
expansion.
From a basic expression for the enthalpy variation
dh = CpdT 4-
(7-6)
where cp is the specific heat at constant pressure of the gas and v its specific volume, 
we can determine the ratio of the temperature variation (<5T) to the pressure drop P) 
during a J-T expansion. This ratio is known as the Joule-Thomson effect coefficient /z
(7-7)
Note that for an ideal gas we have a specific equation of state: Pv —rT. Thus, we can 
write (Sv/STjp = v/T, and we get /i = 0.
There is no temperature variation associated with an isenthalpic expansion for an 
ideal gas. On the contrary, for a real gas, the J-T coefficient can either be negative or 
positive. This fact is illustrated in Fig. 7-5 in which constant enthalpy lines for nonideal 
gas conditions are represented in a temperature versus pressure diagram.

Figure 7-5 Joule-Thomson expansion inversion curve
The full line, referred to as the inversion curve, corresponds to the condition g
For an isenthalpic expansion, a cooling effect (g > 0) is observed inside the inversion 
curve, and a heating effect (g < 0) is noted outside. A temperature can also be defined 
above which no cooling effect can be achieved by any isenthalpic expansion. This temper­
ature, referred as the maximum inversion temperature, is represented by a broken line in 
Fig. 7-5. Table 7-2 gives the maximum inversion temperatures for some cryogenic fluids.
The isenthalpic J-T expansion is basically an irreversible process, and therefore 
the associated theoretical COP is poor. Nevertheless this expansion is commonly used 
for cooling because of its simplicity and its capability for miniaturization owing to the 
absence of a need for any moving part at low temperature.
The representation of a typical refrigeration cycle, including a J-T. expansion pro­
cess, is shown on a T-S diagram in Fig. 7-6. The high-pressure gas is precooled (1 -*  2) 
by the low-pressure gas (4 —► 5) in a counterflow heat exchanger. If the counterflow heat 
exchanger is properly sized, the isenthalpic expansion of the precooled high-pressure 
gas leads to a two-phase mixture of liquid (3) in equilibrium with its vapor at the low

removed at constant temperature (Tc) by evaporation of the liquid fraction in the mixture

If the counterflow heat exchanger operation is adiabatic, it can easily be shown that 
* 
the specific cooling power (qc = Qc/m, where m is the fluid mass flow rate and Qc 
the cooling power) is given by the specific enthalpy difference between the high- and 
low-pressure gas at the warm end of the heat exchanger (qc = h\ — h$). For a perfect 
heat exchanger there is no temperature difference between the high- and low-pressure 
gas at the warm end (Ta). Then the maximum specific cooling power is available and is 
equal to the isothermal enthalpy variation:
Thus, the cooling temperature Tc is determined by the low-pressure value
(7-8)
For a given low pressure (which is often the atmospheric pressure), the maximal 
specific cooling power is a function of the high pressure, and there is an optimal value 
for this high pressure that maximizes the specific cooling power. Figure 7-7 shows the 
variation of the specific cooling power with the high pressure for nitrogen and argon, 
which are commonly used for cooling around 80 K.
7-3 INEFFICIENCIES AND PARASITIC LOSSES
IN REAL CRYOCOOLERS
Real cryocoolers operate practically in a markedly different way from the ideal de­
scription given in the previous section, and the resulting performances are strongly

degraded. Some of the reasons for inefficiency or parasitic losses are briefly discussed 
hereafter.
7-3-1 Piston Motion
In the ideal Stirling cycle description given in section 7-2-1 the compression and expan­
sion piston motions are discontinuous to achieve a truly isochoric gas transfer between 
the compression and the expansion volumes. In practical Stirling cryocoolers these pis­
tons move with continuous quasisinusoidal motions, the expansion piston leading the 
compression piston by a phase angle generally about 90° to approximate the theoretical 
figure. The resulting overlap in the motion of the compression and expansion pistons 
induces a deformation of the ideal work diagram and a loss in efficiency.

SMALL CRYOCOOLERS 297
7-3-2 Dead Volumes
In the ideal regenerator cycles the gas is assumed to be totally expelled from the cold 
volume and the regenerator when it undergoes compression. In practice, the existing 
dead volumes waste part of the compression work. The reduction of void volumes is thus 
important but is practically restricted because, in the heat exchangers and regenerators, 
there is a competition between the efficiency of heat transfer and a low-pressure drop 
constraint. A similar parasitic effect occurs during the expansion process.
7-3-3 Pressure Drop
The pressure drop in the regenerator matrix and heat exchangers induces a reduction of 
the amplitude of the pressure variation in the expansion space compared with the pressure 
variation in the compression space, resulting in a decrease of the specific refrigeration 
effect and in a relative increase of the compression work.
7-3-4 Non isotherm al Operation
In the ideal regenerative cycles, reversible isothermal compression and expansion pro­
cesses are assumed. In the real machines, large variations of the gas temperature are 
observed either in the compression or in the expansion volume owing to the limited sur­
face area for heat transfer, resulting in a significant efficiency loss. When it is technically 
possible, heat exchangers are introduced on both sides of the regenerator to improve the 
heat transfer between the cycle working gas and the ambient or cold heat sinks.
7-3-5 Regenerator or Counterflow Heat Exchanger Inefficiency
In a regenerative cycle, the thermal efficiency of the regenerator is of major importance. 
This efficiency can be defined in a rough estimate as £ = (Ta - 7)/(Ta — Tc), where Ta 
and Tc are, respectively, the ambient and cold heat sinks temperature and T the average 
temperature of the gas after it has passed through the regenerator for precooling before 
entering the expansion volume. Thermal efficiencies larger than 0.99 are necessary to 
achieve reasonable overall efficiency of the cryocooier. The actual process of regenera­
tor heating and cooling is very complicated because it involves periodic variation of the 
gas and matrix temperatures in space and time. A precise modeling of the regenerator 
operation is nevertheless necessary to obtain a realistic simulation of the regenerative 
cryocooler’s operation for sizing and optimization. Extensive effort has been and is al­
ways devoted to theoretical analysis and numerical simulation of regenerators. Extensive 
information on cryocooler theoretical analysis and computer simulation status are given 
in two specialized books [1£].
Similarly, for cycles based on the Joule-Thomson expansion, the efficiency of the 
counterflow heat exchanger is critical. For miniature J-T cryocoolers the heat exchanger 
is usually made of acupro-nickel capillary tube, with copper fins soldered to its outside, 
wound around a cylindrical mandrel and inserted in a stainless steel or glass sheath 
(i.e., internal well of a Dewar). The compressed gas flows inside the coiled capillary 
tube. The expanded gas flows transversely over the coiled finned tube in the annular gap 

298 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
between the mandrel and the outer sheath. Such a heat exchanger is shown in Fig. 7-9 
in section 7-4-1 The modeling and heat transfer analysis of this type of heat exchanger 
have been studied and compared with experience by Geist and Lashmet [3].
7-3-6 Thermal Losses
Thermal conduction along the walls of the regenerator sleeve, the expansion cylinder, 
or both, and through the porous matrix of the regenerator reduces the net cooling power 
of any practical cryocooler. To mmimize these losses, a high-strength and low-thermal- 
conductivity material (such as stainless steel or titanium) is used for the cylinder walls. 
Epoxy-fiberglass material or plastic materials with low thermal conductivity are often 
used for the regenerator sleeve. The regenerator matrix itself is generally made from 
stacks of metallic wire mesh or balls. The axial heat conduction from one disk or ball to 
another is negligible compared with the radial heat conduction along the wire or in the 
ball.
Parasitic convective heat transfer is generally eliminated by using cryocoolers in 
high-vacuum Dewars. The radiative heat transfer from ail surrounding surfaces at higher 
temperature than the cold heat sink temperature can be minimized by properly controlling 
the reflectivity and the emissivity (polishing, gold or silver coating) of these surfaces or 
by incorporating multilayer insulation (ML1) such as aluminized Mylar or Kapton sheets 
acting as thermal radiation screens between the cold and the warm surfaces.
For Stirling and G~M cryocoolers, specific thermal losses are linked to their dynamic 
operation. A temperature gradient exists along the cylinder and the expansion piston (or 
displacer) walls between the ambient and the cold tip temperature. When the expansion 
piston (or displacer) is moving in the cylinder, large differences in the temperature of 
the stationary surface may occur, resulting in a heat transfer from the ambient side to the 
cold tip. This process, generally called shuttle heat transfer, can be limited by reducing 
the stroke of the expansion piston.
Additional heat loss may occur from the gas mass flow circulating in the annular 
dead volume between the expansion piston and the cylinder wall.
7-3-7 Conclusion
Owing to various irreversibilities and parasitic losses occurring in real cryocoolers, their 
actual efficiency is quite far from tne theoretical figure. To illustrate this point we report 
in Fig. 7-8 the result of a comprehensive compilation made at the National Bureau of 
Standards [4] about the performances of over 100 cryocoolers. The efficiency, in terms 
of percentage of Carnot value (actual COP/Camot COP), is given as a function of the 
'ooling capacity for various types of cryocoolers at various cooling temperatures.
For small cryocoolers (cooling capacity <100 W) we note that the actual COP 
"s from 1 to 10% of the theoretical Carnot COP.
lother reference is given by the measured performances of the most efficient 
"ryocoolers that have recently been developed for space application. Typically, 
'g power of a few watts at 80 K, the specific energy consumption is about 30 W 
mput power per watt of cooling power (about 10% of the Carnot COP).

7-4 CRYOCOOLERS: APPLICATIONS AND STATE OF THE ART
7-4-1 Joule-Thomson Expansion Cryocoolers
Miniature cryocooiers employing Joule-Thomson (i.e., isenthalpic) expansion have been 
developed in the mid-1950s almost simultaneously by Hymatic Engineering Company 
in England and Air Products, Inc., in the United States.
A well-established market for these coolers is the military infrared missile guidance 
systems that require cooling capacities of a few hundreds of milliwatts at liquid nitrogen 
temperature (about 80 K). Joule-Thomson expansion cryocoolers have been preferred 
for this application because of their capability for miniaturization, ability to withstand 
large accelerations (no moving part), and rapid cool-down times (few seconds). In these 
applications they are used in an open-cycle mode. High-pressure gas is supplied from a 
storage reservoir (rechargeable, if necessary, if subsequent cool-downs are expected).
A typical miniature J-T expansion cryocooler is represented in Fig. 7-9. The finned- 
type counterflow heat exchanger wound around an insulating mandrel is introduced in 
an evacuated Dewar.
High-purity compressed gas (air, nitrogen, or argon) is required for operation to avoid 
plugging of the expansion orifice by condensation of contaminants such as water, carbon 
dioxide, or hydrocarbons. A microporous filter is incorporated at the inlet to remove 
solid particles. After precooling by the low-pressure return flow in the counterflow heat 
exchanger, the high-pressure gas is expanded isenthalpically in an expansion orifice.

The liquid-vapor mixture obtained after expansion is collected in a separation chamber 
on the bottom of which is attached the infrared detector to be cooled.
Two different types of expansion devices are commonly used. The simplest system 
is a fixed-area orifice that has the main advantage of being easy and cheap to manufacture.
However, a fixed-area expansion orifice has a major disadvantage: the mass flow rate 
through the orifice increases continuously as the temperature decreases (because gas 
density increases and viscosities decrease). If the orifice is sized for high mass flow rate 
at room temperature to ensure a quick cool-down time, the mass flow rate at operatin 
conditions will be largely excessive. On the other hand, if the orifice is sized for the 
proper mass flow rate at nominal operating conditions, the cool-down time will be 
very long owing to a very low mass flow rate at room temperature. To overcome these 
difficulties, variable area, temperature-sensitive expansion devices have been developed. 
A schematic of such a system is represented in Fig. 7-9. The area of the expansion orifice 
is adjusted by moving a needle in or out of it. The motion of the needle is controlled 
by a metallic bellow to which it is attached. The pressure inside the bellows is the J-T 
cooler’s low pressure. A gas charge in a chamber surrounding the bellows squeezes it. 
The pressure in this chamber is controlled by a vapor pressure thermometer with its bulb

SMALL CRYOCOOLERS 301
immersed in the expanded gas. I'hus, as the temperature of the expanded as decreases,
the pressure in the chamber and the force acting on the bellows decrease, allowing the 
needle to enter into the orifice and cause a mass flow rate reduction. In this way, an 
automatic control is achieved allowing for a maximum mass flow rate during cool-down 
and an adjusted mass flow rate at nominal operating condition to compensate the heat 
load strictly.
Open-cycle systems do not require any power input, and generally the low-pressure 
gas is directly vented to the atmosphere. They are well adapted to man-handleable and 
restricted space applications. Typical miniature J-T systems are shown in Fig. 7-10.
For some applications such as electronics cooling, continuous operation is required. 
In this case, a closed-cycle-type operation may be achieved by connecting a compressor 
to the J-T expansion unit. These compressors are sophisticated devices because the 
compression ratios involved arc large (200 to 400:1). To minimize the work of compres­
sion and achieve a quasi-isothermal operation, multistaged reciprocating compressors 
with intercooling arc generally used. A major problem is gas cleaning to remove any 
contaminant after compression. Such a compressor is shown in Fig, 7-11.
Microminiature J-T cryocoolers of small cooling capacity (less than 100 mW at 
80 K) using photolithographic processes to etch the counterflow heat exchanger on a flat 
glass plate and a fine capillary for gas expansion, have also been developed by Little 
[51. Capable of rapid cool-down because of their small mass, they are well adapted for 
laboratory study on superconductors or semiconductors.

7-4-2 Gifford-McMahon Cryocoolers
Cryocoolers intended to follow an Ericsson cycle (isobaric-isothermal) were invented 
and patented at the end of the nineteenth century by Solvay (with a fixed regenerator 
and expansion piston for work extraction) and Postle (displacer with integrated moving 
regenerator). Gifford and McMahon of A.D. Little, Inc., industrialized and commer­
cialized this type of cryocooler in the late 1950s, which is nowadays widely produced 
by several companies in a large range of cooling capacities. Its success comes from a 
proven high reliability, minimal maintenance due to a low operating frequency (1-2 Hz), 
and a robust technology. Gifford-McMahon cryocoolers are mainly used integrated into 
mechanical cryopumps for applications requiring a clean and high vacuum. They are 
also widely used now by physicists for sample cooling in cryostats and have replaced 
cryogenic fluids (LN2 or LH2).
The high- and low-pressure levels required in the Ericsson cycle are provided by 
helium compressing units. These units incorporate compressors developed for domes­
tic refrigerators, thus taking advantage of a large-scale production with resulting cost 

SMALL CRYOCOOLERS 303
reductions. They include piston, rolling, or scroll-type compressors. The cycle gas used 
in these cryocoolers is helium. As a monoatomic gas, its isobaric to isochoric specific 
heat ratio (y = c?/c? = 1.67) is larger than the one of polyatomic fluids (CFC or hydro­
carbons with y ranging between 1 and 1.3) commonly used in domestic refrigerators. 
Helium results in a larger temperature rise during compression. To avoid any damage 
to the compressor valves or any cracking of the lubricant, oil is injected in the helium 
at the level of the compressor suction line, then acting as a thermal moderator during 
compression. Most of this oil is later removed from the compressed helium by centrifu­
gation and coalescence. The remaining traces (a few parts per million) are trapped in 
an activated charcoal adsorber. The compression unit is connected to the cold finger by 
two (high and low) pressure lines, allowing for a separation of both subsystems without 
any noticeable efficiency loss.
A schematic of a two-stage cryocooler cold finger with two expansion volumes 
providing cooling at different temperature levels is shown in Fig. 7-12. This is a common 
feature that does not increase the mechanical complexity of the cooler too much and 
improves the efficiency by reducing the temperature difference between cold and hot 
heat sinks for each stage. Such a cryocooler provides a first level of temperature for 
cryopumping applications at about 80 K useful for the cooling of baffles for water vapor 
condensation and thermal shielding of the second stage, which is operated at about 15 K 
for the cooling of activated charcoal to allow for air, hydrogen, and helium cryotrapping. 
Such an arrangement of a mechanical cryopump is shown in Fig. 7-13.
To operate and synchronize the valves and displacer motions properly two types of 
drive mechanisms are commonly used. A first mode of operation uses a mechanical drive 
with a crankshaft or eccentric cams, or both, kept in rotation by a motor and governing 
the movement of the displacer and the opening and closing of the valves.
In an alternate mode, the inlet and exhaust of the cycle gas are controlled through 
a rotary valve driven by a motor, as shown in Fig. 7-12. Then the mechanically driven 
displacer is replaced by a free displacer moved by differential pressure forces acting on 
a small-section extension of the displacer. The high- and low-cycle pressures alternately 
act on one extremity of this small section cylinder, the other extremity remaining at the 
mean cycle pressure, resulting in a reciprocating force on the displacer.
The forces required to move the displacer are quite small because the resistant forces 
acting on it are only due to the pressure drop through the regenerator and the sliding 
piston seal friction. The sealing is not a severe problem, for the pressure is almost the 
same on both sides of the displacer and the frequency of operation is low. This is a 
reason why maintenance is only required after about 15,000 hours of operation for the 
G-M cryocoolers.
The first stage regenerators (300-50 K) arc commonly made of metallic wire mesh 
(stainless steel or bronze) with wire diameters and apertures of about 50 to 100 /zm. 
Because the heat capacity of common materials decreases at low temperature (below 
50 K), whereas the heat capacity of the cycle fluid helium increases, the efficiency of 
the regenerator is strongly affected. To minimize this effect, lead shots (diameter about 
200 jzm) are used in the second stage regenerator because lead exhibits the largest volu­
metric specific heat at low temperature among the common materials used. In practice,

The principal drawback of the G-M cryocooler is its poor efficiency, for no work is

points

Gifford-Me Mahon cryocoolers are reliable but are limited to ultimate temperatures of 
about 10 K Various applications or systems such as niobium-titamum superconducting 
magnets or bolometers and Josephson junctions for detectors still require cooling at
liquid helium temperatures The u^e of pool-boilin cryostats for such applications may
be constraining and expensive for long term operation To provide mechanical cooling 
and avoid any cryogenic fluid refilling and consumption at4K it has been suggested to 
combine a G-M cooler and a J-T expander

7-4-4 Stirling Cryocoolers
In the mid-1950s, the first Stirling cryocooler was developed and industrialized by Philips 
Laboratories for air liquefaction. This type of engine is still commercialized nowadays 
as well as derived products such as two-stage versions for hydrogen liquefaction and 
multicylinder engines for cooling power of up to a few kilowatts
However, main developments and applications of Stirling cryocoolers are related 
today to the cooling of infrared detectors and associated cold electronics for night vision 
and missile guidance and may in the near future lead to the development of applications 
including high-temperaturc superconducting materials. For these applications, com­
pactness and efficiency are often the more important criteria; thus the high-frequency- 
operated miniature Stirling coolers have emerged as the best possible compromise. The 
typical cooling power requirement for Stirling refrigerators is from about a quarter of a 
watt up to a few watts in the temperature range 50-80 K, depending on the type and size 
of the detector to be cooled. For this level of temperature, a single-staged cold finger is 
sufficient. Main development efforts are aimed to increase the lifetime and the efficiency 
of these coolers and to lower their size, their electromagnetic noise, and their exported 
vibrations. A large number of mechanical arrangements have been explored. We shall 
summarize in this section the main basic configurations.
A Stirling cryocooler is made of two specific elements:
• A pressure oscillator operating at ambient temperature in which a reciprocating piston 
transmits mechanical work to the cycle gas and generates a pressure oscillation in the 
refrigerator cold finger.
& A cold finger cylinder in which a displacer containing the regenerator matrix separates 
two volumes at ambient and cold temperature. When reciprocating in the cylinder, 
ideally without any work, the displacer forces the gas from one volume to the other. An 
appropriate phasing of the displacer motion versus the pressure oscillations generated 
by the oscillator provides the cooling effect.
The cooling capacity of a Stirling cooler operating with a real gas is given by 
Qc = TV faVcdP, where a is the expansivity [a — T/V(3 V/3T)pj, P the pressure 
in the cooler, Vc the variable expansion space, and N the frequency of operation. The 
development of this expression, taking into account the motion and phase shift of both 
the compression piston and the displacer as well as other parameters such as the cycle 
mean pressure and the cold tip temperature, has been discussed by Schmidt, and the 
main results of this analysis are reported by Walker [ I ].
In an integral cooler the pressure oscillator and the cold finger are integrated in the 
same casing and mechanically driven by the same crankshaft. The two cylinders are 
often arranged on orthogonal axes, which simplifies the achievement of the 90° phase 
angle between compression pistons and expansion displacer required for a maximum 
cooling effect. Such an arrangement is represented in Fig. 7-16.
The main advantages of the integral arrangement arc the mechanical control of 
both piston and expander stroke and phase and the minimization of the connecting dead 
volume between the pressure oscillator and the cold finger. A disadvantage is that it is

SMALL CRYOCOOLERS 309
Figure 7-16 An integral-type Stirling cooler (Courtesy PAir Liquidc.)
very difficult to cancel or at least damp the mechanical vibrations generated by the piston 
motion and directly transmitted to the tip of the cold finger.
In a split arrangement the pressure oscillator and the cold finger are completely 
independent and connected by a small internal diameter tube. A split Stirling cooler is 
shown in Fig. 7-17. What results from this arrangement is a larger flexibility in the 
integration of the cooler to the system. It should not be forgotten that the connecting 
line acts like a dead volume and may reduce the efficiency of the cooler.
Conventional split Stirling pressure oscillators are of rotary design: the rotor of 
a brushless motor is directly coupled to a crankshaft coupling mechanism connected 
to the compression piston. To avoid cycle gas contamination by oil lubrication, scaled 
ball bearings or dry-rubbing materials are used for the shaft mounting. A component of 
the force acting on the piston pushes the piston against the cylinder wall, resulting in a 
friction and wear that limits the life of the oscillator (typically a few thousand hours).
Linear drive systems are widely developed today. In this new arrangement, pis­
ton side forces are eliminated, and consequently, rubbing seals have been replaced by 
clearance seals, resulting in a significant increase of the mean time before failure. More­
over, the use of twin pistons operated in opposition leads to a very significant reduction 
of induced vibrations. The moving piston is submitted on one side to the cycle pres­
sure oscillations and on its opposite side to the mean cycle pressure, resulting in a gas

310 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
Figure 7-17 A linear split-type Stirling cooler (Courtesy Cryolechnologies SA)
spring-like force acting on it. To minimize the axial force to be delivered by the linear 
motor, the pressure oscillators are thus operated at the resonance frequency resulting 
from the inertia and gas-spring mutual compensation (this frequency is typically a few 
tens of hertz).
In the split arrangement there is no more mechanical mechanism to control the 
stroke of the cold finger displacer and its phase relationship with the oscillator piston. It 
is obvious for cost reasons (excepted for space applications) that a specific motorization 
of the displacer with phase control cannot be considered. The motion of the displacer is 
then obtained by pneumatic means, as shown by the schematic diagram of a cold finger 
in Fig. 7-18.
Owing to the pressure oscillations generated by the pressure oscillator, a periodic 
force acts on the displacer (mean pressure in the buffer volume and oscillating pressure 
in the expansion volume) and drives its reciprocating motion. The frictional damping 
(rubbing or clearance seal) generates the appropriate phase shift for effective cooling. 
The main problem associated with pneumatically driven displacers is the variation in 
time of the damping force, resulting in long-term performance degradation.
For space applications (Earth observation) speci fic technologies for long-life Stirling 
coolers have been developed To avoid any wear, frictionless operation is achieved by
clearance sealing and contactless bearings. Prototypes using active magnetic bearings,
hydrodynamic gas bearings (8), or flexure bearings have been designed and developed.

industrialized and space-qualified by Matra Marconi Space (previously BAe) is given 
in Fig 7-19. Both the pressure oscillator and the expansion displacer are driven by a 
loudspeaker-type linear motor. The phase between both piston and displacer motions is 
measured by position transducers and electronically controlled. In its latest version, this 
cooler is capable of about 2 W of cooling power at 80 K with about 60 W of electrical 
input power to the pressure oscillator. Double-staged versions of this cooler as well as a 
compound two-stage Stirling and J-T expansion loop system are under development [10].
A summary of different cryocooler types and their relative merits is given in
Table 7.3.
7-5 FUTURE TRENDS IN CRYOCOOLER DEVELOPMENT
Cryocoolers are nowadays used in appreciable numbers for various applications. To 
promote a larger diffusion, strong development efforts arc being undertaken mainly 
to improve their reliability, efficiency, and capability for significant cooling power at 
low temperature (i.e., liquid helium temperature). The recent results obtained in these 
developments, which probably prefigure the future trends in cryocooler technology, are 
reported hereafter.

7-5-1 Magnetic Materials for Regenerators
The ultimate temperature achievable by G-M or Stirlin cryocoolers is limited to about
10K by the large inefficiency of the regeneration process when temperature decreases. 
The main reasons for this efficiency drop are the increasing mass of gas kept and cycli­
cally pressurized and expanded in the void volume of the regenerator porous matrix and 
the volumetric specific heat diminution of most of the commonly used metallic materials 
for regeneration while the volumetric specific heat of the helium cycle gas increases. The 
volumetric specific heat of some usual materials for regenerators is reported in Fig. 7-20.
New geometries of regenerators based on perforated thermally conductive plates 
stacking with thermally insulating spacers arc under validation. They will allow for 
low void volume fractions, moderate pressure drops, and large heat transfers at low
temperature.
A way to cope with the helium gas specific heat enhancement is to use materials
exhibiting a comparable specific heat anomaly. This is the case in the temperature range
of interest (4 to 15K) of several rare-earth-based materials that undergo a magnetic 
ordering. Several compounds have been suggested, and their volumetric specific heats 
have been experimentally determined. Among them, ErgNi appears as a good compro­
mise with well-adapted specific heat (see Fig. 7-20), chemical stability, insensitivity to 
oxidation, and the capability to be prepared in the form of spheres.

cooling. On the other hand, the efficiency of closed-cycle J-T systems in the 80-K 
temperature range is poor owing to their low specific cooling power and the high pres­
sure required for optimal operation (several hundreds of atmospheres) with a single gas 
(nitrogen, air, or argon). However, large improvements in specific cooling power and 
efficiency can be achieved by the use of mixtures of gases as proposed by Alfeev [12]. 
More recently, at MMR Technologies, Inc., and at CEA/SBT, these results have been 
confirmed, and analysis of the thermodynamic properties of these mixtures has been 
performed for performance optimization. Suitable mixtures containing nitrogen and hy­
drocarbons provide at 80 K, with pressures of the order of 30 bars, the same specific 
cooling power as pure nitrogen under 150 bars. This reduction in operating pressure 
allows for large improvements in efficiency and for the use of less sophisticated com­
pressors. Recently, a prototype of a J-T cooler, operated with a Gifford-McMahon-like 
helium compressor using a gas mixture and capable of 10 W of cooling at 95 K, has 
been developed by Air Products. Future developments will probably give rise to a 
new generation of closed-cycle J-T coolers using gas mixtures in the 80-K temperature 
range.
7-5-3 Pulse-Tube Refrigerators
Miniature Stirling coolers are widely used for fractional watt cooling when miniature 
size, weight, and high efficiency are required. Nevertheless, the technological complexity 
of the cold finger, including a moving displacer-regenerator with clearance seal and 
pneumatic drive, is a limitation to the reliability and ease of integration of these coolers. 
A new concept of cooler is emerging that allows for the design of a cold finger with no 
moving part: the pulse tube cooler.
In 1963 Gifford and Longsworth [13] published results concerning a pulse-tube 
cooler (generally referred to as the basic pulse tube) with no moving part in which 
a cooling effect was achieved by surface heat pumping. This heat transfer mode is

restricted to low-frequency operation by the gas thermal diffusivity and results in a poor 
efficiency, only allowing attainment of ultimate temperatures of about 150K. Owing to 
this performance limitation, the basic pulse tube has not been further developed. Later 
on, Mikulin et al. [14} and Zhu ct al. [15] proposed new concepts respectively known 
as orifice and double inlet pulse tubes.
Ultimate temperatures of about 80 and 40K, respectively, have been achieved by 
these authors. A schematic of the various arrangements for pulse tubes (basic, orifice, 
double inlet) is presented in Fig. 7-21. The pulse tube refrigerator consists of two 
components:
• A subsystem for pressure wave generation. It can be either a pressure oscillator (as in 
a Stirling cooler) or a compressor associated with a rotating valve distributor (as in a 
G-M cooler).
• A set of two tubes. The first one is a traditional regenerator connected at its cold end 
to a second tube: a simple hollow tube. At its ambient temperature end this tube is 
connected through a flow impedance (needle valve, calibrated orifice, or capillary) to 
a buffer volume.
The analysis of the heal transfer (enthalpy flow) in the orifice pulse tube arrangement 
has been proposed by Radebaugh and Storch [16].
The pulse tube refrigerator can be compared with a Stirling cooler. The pressure 
oscillator generates adiabatic oscillations of the gas in the tube.
If no disturbance (i .e., turbulence) occurs in the hollow tube, a piston-like motion of 
thegas is achieved. The enthalpy flow in the tube is described in the following paragraphs.
From the energy conservation equation in the adiabatic tube we get

If the proper phasing (<p = 0) is achieved between the pressure wave generated 
by the oscillator and the gas velocity in the tube, a maximal cooling effect is obtained. 
In the basic pulse tube configuration the pressure and the velocity are In quadrature 
and consequently no enthalpy flow (i.c., cooling power) is obtained. By means of the 
impedance Vi and of the buffer volume, as represented in Fig. 7-21, the phase <p can be 
properly adjusted, and a cooling effect is obtained.
Extensive work is performed on the pulse lube concept in several laboratories in the 
world. At CEA/SBTJ or example 117), an ultimate temperature of 28 K has been obtained 
in a single-stage cooler. Developments for low'-frequency (using a helium compressor 
and a rotary valve as in G-M coolers) and high-frequency (using a pressure oscillator as 
In Stirling coolers) systems are in progress. Performances and efficiencies comparable 
to Stirling (1 -10 W at 80K) or G-M (100 W at 80 K) coolers have been demonstrated. 
Multistage systems with magnetic material regenerators are under development for low- 
temperature cooling (Z < 4K).
I he technological simplicity of the pulse tube cold finger results in a large reliability 
and ease of integration. Moreover, the absence of any moving piston and motorization 
strongly reduces the vibrations and electromagnetic noise exported to the cold tip. Some 
pulse-tube cold finger laboratory' prototypes are shown in Fig. 7-22.
It is obvious that in the near future pulse coolers will strongly compete with tra­
ditional G-M, Stirling and J-T coolers in a large range of temperatures and cooling 
powers.

7-5-4 Adsorption Coolers
Adsorption coolers are at the edge of the present subject, and we briefly describe hereafter 
the basic principle along with an example of application These systems rely on the 
capability of porous materials, when cyclically cooled or heated to adsorb or release a 
gas With a few exceptions their range of interest remains below 10 K This is due in 
part to the fact that to alternately heat up or cool down the element containing the porous 
material requires an amount of power or energy that becomes prohibitively large as the 
temperature increases (owing to the increase of the associated heat capacities)
One can either design a sorpt-on compressor to drive, for example, a J-T loop or a 
sorption pump to pump on a liquid bath to decrease its temperature Various prototypes 
have been developed for both uses Bard et al and Wade and Levy [18,19], who have 
done extensive work on the sorption compressor, have, for instance, developed a 10-K 
sorption cooler This concept is based on sequentially heating beds containing metal 
hydride powders to circulate hydrogen as the refrigerant fluid in a closed cycle J-T 
refrigeration system
Duband et a! [20] have developed various self-contained helium sorption coolers 
for laboratory uses and space applications In these sealed systems, initially described by 
Torre and Chanin [21], a sorption pump holding activated charcoal is heated to release 
the adsorbed gas until the pressure is sufficient to condense liquid, then the sorption 
pump is cooled down to readsorb gas and pump on the liquid helium bath to decrease its 
temperature For example, Fig 7-23 shows the3He adsorption cooler designed to cool

8-1 INTRODUCTION
The applications of superconductivity can be divided into four categories:
1. High DC or slow ramping magnets for fundamental and medical research.
2. Industrial applications with possible use in large electrical networks such as alterna­
tors, transformers, and current limiters.
3. Radio-frequency (RF) cavities (at high frequency, a superconducting material ex­
hibits a surface resistance that is much lower than the resistance of a normal metal.
Thus, using superconductin
materials for RF cavities, even in continuous operation,
consumes much less power than copper cavities in the pulsed mode),
4. Low-current applications for electronics, mainly Josephson junctions used for mea-
surin very low magnetic fields (SQUIDS) and passive circuits (antennas, resonators,
filters, delay lines, etc.).
Although all these applications use the general phenomenon of superconductivity, 
they are based on different properties of the material. Only the DC magnet technology 
will be covered in the following sections.
For the construction of magnets, superconducting materials have been used mainly 
for fundamental research (particle accelerators, fusion devices, etc.). A remarkable ex­
ception is their large development in the medical field for use in magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) scanners.
Up to now, all superconducting magnets for applications have been refrigerated 
with helium in liquid, gaseous, or mixed phase at very low temperature. This is because

the only materials available for these applications are the so-called low-critical-tem­
perature superconductors in opposition to the more recent high-critical-temperature 
superconductors.
*
After a review of the general properties of superconductors, the main elements
that affect the design and construction of superconducting magnets will be considered: 
conceptual design, conductor and losses, cooling and thermal stability, and insulating 
materials and protection in case of quench (return to the resistive state). For illustration, 
some applications will be described at the end of the chapter.
8-2 GENERAL PROPERTIES OF SUPERCONDUCTORS
8-2-1 Critical Parameters
Critical temperature. The first property of a superconducting material, that its electrical 
resistance falls abruptly to zero under a temperature Tc called the critical temperature, was 
discovered by Kammerlingh Onnes in 1911. This phenomenon is completely different 
from the behavior of a normal conductor, even a very pure one, for which the decrease 
of resistance with temperature is smooth and never reaches a zero value (Fig. 8-1).
Critical magnetic field1 and critical current density. After the discovery of this prop­
erty, it was found that a superconductin
material also has a critical magnetic field Bc
and a critical current density Jc. All these properties are related to each other. In a 
three-dimensional space (7, B, J), each superconducting material can be characterized 
by its critical surface (Fig. 8-2). The material is superconducting everywhere below this 
surface, and resistive above.
Meissner effect. The notion of critical-flux density is related to the Meissner effect, 
discovered in 1933, which is the absence inside a superconducting material of flux

• For 0 < H < Hc[, there is no flux density in the superconductor; the behavior is the 
same as for type I superconductors.
• For HC| < H < /7c21 there is a partial penetration of the flux density in the supercon­
ductor. This is called the "mixed slate.”
• For H > HC2, the superconductivity disappears.

Bj = 
+ Af) = 0
(8-1)
where Ha is the strength of the applied field and M is the magnetization of the material.
This exclusion is produced by superconducting currents flowing at the surface of 
the superconductor within a very thin depth called the penetration depth. For a super­
conducting material at some temperature below Tc, the critical flux density is the upper 
limit of the flux that can be excluded by the material.
8-2-2 Different Types of Superconductors
Type I superconductors. The full exclusion of magnetic flux is typical of so-called 
type 1 superconductors (Fig. 8-3(a)). Most of the pure metals belong to this category 
(Table 8-1). These have almost no practical applications for magnets owing to the very 
low value of their critical flux density.
Type II superconductors. A more complicated phenomenon happens in so-called 
type II superconductors. Two critical magnetic fields Hc\ and HC2 can be defined 
(Fig. 8-3(b)) with the following characteristics:

324 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
Figure 8-3 Magnetization and flux penetration for (a) type I and (b) type I! superconductors.
In the “mixed state ” magnetic flux penetrates the superconductor and creates normal 
cores in the form of tubes surrounded by supercurrent vortices.
All the superconducting materials for magnet applications are of type H because it 
is the only type that enables the transport of large currents in high magnetic fields.
Pinning centers. The possibility of having large transport currents in type II supercon­
ductors is due to the presence of pinning centers created by defects in the crystalline 
structure that are
enerated by sophisticated metallurgic processes. They prevent the
normal tubes from moving under Lorentz forces and creating a resistance due to flux 
flow, which would generate power dissipation. The transport current in the supercon­
ductor can be increased up to its critical value, which is the one for which the Lorentz 
force equals the pinning force.
Practical superconducting materials. Among all the superconducting materials, two 
categories will be considered: alloys and A15 compounds.
The main critical characteristics of the most common materials are given in Ta­
ble 8-2:
• Niobium titanium alloy (NbTi) and niobium tin (NbaSn) have been used nearly ex­
clusively for all existing applications, and their properties have been continuously 
improved over the years.
• Tantaium-doped niobium titanium (NbTiTa)and niobium aluminum (Nfc^Al) are more 
recent materials with enhanced properties, making them promising, but they are still 
under industrial development.

8-3 PRACTICAL SUPERCONDUCTING MATERIALS
8-3-1 Niobium Titanium
Metallurgy and superconducting properties. Niobium titanium (NbTi) is by far the 
most widely used superconducting material in present magnet technology. Its supercon­
ducting properties, up to 8- to 10-T magnetic field, cover most of the existing applications 
with high-current performances and convenient operating temperatures. Furthermore, 
NbTi is a ductile alloy that can be drawn fairly easily into multifilamcntary composites, 
and its high mechanical properties enable the fabrication of solid coils resisting large 
magnetic forces without degradation.
The alloy composition can vary according to different optimization criteria. A max­
imum critical temperature of 10.1 K is reached with 25 wt % Ti, whereas the critical 
field is maximum at around 44 % Ti. However, the dependence of these parameters on 
the composition is rather weak and, for practical feasibility, the range of composition is 
usually chosen between 40 to 50 wt % Ti. A particular effort for enhancing the critical 
current performances of fine filament composites has been concentrated for many years 
on the Nb-46.5 wt % Ti alloy under the strong impulse of the SSC Research and Devel­
opment program in the United States [ 1 ]. This special composition has therefore become 
the most commonly used.
An efficient way of enhancing the upper critical field is alloying the NbTi with a 
ternary element, mainly tantalum [2]. A tantalum content between 15 and 25% is found 
to increase Bc2 by » 0.3T at 4.2 K, but more significantly by 1.3Tat 1.8 K. However, the 
optimization of the critical-current density appears more difficult to achieve with ternary 
alloys, and industrial manufacturing problems have not yet been properly solved.
Continuous progress has been made over the last three decades towards higher 
critical current and low AC loss performances together with cost-effective industrial 
production. The critical current is related to the number and to the distribution of flux 
pinning centers, which result, in the classical method of fabrication of multifilamentary 
composites, from a combination of cold work and heat treatments to produce a-Ti 
precipitates in defects of the lattice structure. A more recent method of manufacturing 
NbTi is by creating artificial pinning centers (A PC) [3]. These can be obtained in different 
ways, such as by incorporating fine fibers of normal material in the superconductor lattice 
or by a “jelly-roll” technique.

326 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
Alternating current losses are decreased by reducing the size of filaments and, if 
necessary, by using a high resistivity matrix material, resistive barriers, or both, around 
the filaments. Very fine filaments, in the micrometer or submicron range, must be pro­
tected from size effects such as “sausaging” by using high-homogeneous NbTi alloy in 
the process and by coating the filaments with an antidiffusion barrier, usually niobium.
Practical formulas for critical parameters. Simple scaling rules can be used to predict, 
with reasonable accuracy over a wide range of field and temperature, the operatin 
characteristics of a given NbTi conductor from a single-point measurement of the critical 
current density at a reference field and reference temperature [4], The reference point is 
generally taken at the field BrCf of 5 T and at a temperature TrCf of 4.2 K.
First, a genera) relationship between the upper critical field Bc2 and temperature, with
no transport current, can be expressed by the following formulas, verified experimentally 
on a large variety of NbTi samples:
Bc2(T) = 14.5(1 - 779.2)'7
or
TC(B) = 9.2(1 - B/14.5)0588 
(8-3)
Assuming linear relationships of Jc versus B and T around the reference point, 
which is also well verified over a wide range, the following expressionscan be derived:
T) = Jc(Bref, T)
*(B
c2(T) - B1/[Bc2(7) - Bref] 
(8-4)
with
T) = Jc(Bref, Trty[Tc(BKf) - T]/[Tc(Bref) - Trefl
For Z?rcf = 5T and Tref = 4.2 K, Tc(jBref) = 7.2K, and so
JC(5,T) = J* f[(7.2-T)/3)J
(8-6)
Another useful quantity is the temperature margin A T between the operating temper­
ature Top and the current-sharing temperature Tcs corresponding to an operating current 
chosen below the critical characteristics:
AT = Tcs(5) - Top = [TC(B) - rop]* [1 - Jop/JdB. Top)l
This AT, translated in enthalpy margin, gives a measure of the operating stability
margin against thermal disturbances.
8-3-2 Niobium Tin and Niobium Aluminum
Metallurgy and superconducting properties. Niobium tin (NbsSn) belongs to the 
family of the Al 5 compound superconductors characterized by the formula A3B, where A 
is a transition metal and B can be either a transition or a nontransition metal. The tin atoms 
form a body-centered cubic sublattice with two atoms of niobi um on each face of the cube. 
The short distance between the niobium atoms in such an arrangement, in comparison 

SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNET TECHNOLOGY 327
with the niobium cell element, is certainly the reason for the good superconducting 
properties.
The pure stoichiometric NbaSn has a theoretical critical temperature of 18 K and an 
upper critical flux density at zero temperature of 28 T. This stoichiometric composition 
is giving the best superconducting properties and is stable at room temperature, which 
is not always the case for A15 compounds. These ideal properties are generally affected 
by a small deviation from the stoichiometric composition and by some kind of compres­
sion introduced inevitably during the fabrication and reaction process due to the other 
elements such as the copper matrix.
The critical-current density Jc is governed by grain boundaries. An increase of the 
pinning strength has been pointed out in relation with a decrease of the grain size.
Unlike NbTi, owing to the flux pinning mechanism, the behavior of NbaSn is mainly 
isotropic (at least for field angles with respect to the strand axis greater than 45°).
The most effective method to enhance Jc consists of alloying with small quantities of
tantalum or titanium leading to the so-called ternary NbsSn. Typically, an Nb-7.5 wt % 
tantalum alloy is used in the bronze process. This increase is related to the increase of 
the normal state resistivity, which is well known to increase Bcz.
The application of stress in compression and in tension leads to a modification of 
the Al 5 structure with associated decrease of Bc and Tc and of course of Jc. Irreversible 
degradation occurs after tensile strain application greater than 0.5% on practical wires [5].
Practical data to be used for critical properties of NbjSn. The formulas 
are valid for binary as well as for ternary alloys. *

The critical non-copper current density Jc can be very well represented by the 
following laws [6]. The non-copper part of the material to be considered includes the un­
reacted niobium, niobium tin, the bronze, and the antidiffusion barrier generally existin 
to prevent the pollution of the pure copper part of the strand:

(8-11)
Bc20 = ®c20m(l - 
T-co = 7^(1 - ae'7)0333 
(8-12)
The following values can be assumed for modern ternary NbsSn strands:
Jo = 3.354 x 1010A/m2 
a = 1250 for £ > 0 (tensile)
TcOm — 18 K BC20m — 28 T 
a = 900 for £ <0 (compressive)
The calibration coefficient Co is in the range of 1010 AT05/m2, typically 1.15 x 
IO10 for strands manufactured according to the internal tin process, leading to Jc — 
700 A/mm2 (B = 12 T, T — 4.2 K), and 0.9 x 1010 for the bronze process, leading to 
JQ = 550A/mm2 (B = 12 T, T = 4.2 K).
A typical value of —0.25% can be taken for e for the strand due to the compressive 
strain induced after heat treatment by the strand matrix (copper and bronze). The critical 

328 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
temperature Tc in operating conditions, which is different from Teo, can be numerically 
calculated as the one for which the critical current density under strain is equal to zero:
7C(B,TC,£) = 0

NbaSn strand. These last five years have seen considerable progress in the production 
of industrial NbsSn wires. Fields of 13 Tare needed for fusion applications, in particular 
for tokamaks, which necessitate large quantities of NbsSn. In the frame of ITER (In­
ternational Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor), a large program has been built with 
several Japanese, Russian, European, and American companies
A typical NbaSn strand of 0.8 mm, such as developed for ITER, consists of several 
thousand filaments (3-5 gm) embedded in a bronze matrix. This assembly can be consti­
tuted by single or by double stacking. The bronze matrix is separated from a pure copper 
shell by an antidiffusion barrier generally made of tantalum and sometimes associated 
with a second antidiffusion barrier made of niobium. This antidiffusion barrier is needed 
to prevent tin pollution of the pure stabilizing copper shell. In certain cases, islands of 
NbsSn filaments are distributed inside the composites, each of them surrounded by the 
antidiffusion barrier. In most of the industrial wires, the A15 phase is produced via a 
solid-state reaction through a bronze matrix. There are several variants of this process. 
The bronze route is the oldest process. The tin is provided from a bronze matrix man­
ufactured separately. Owing to the maximum concentration of tin (15.7 wt %) in the 
ductile phase of bronze, an intrinsic limitation of the current density exists. The effective 
filament diameters can reach low values in the range of 5 gm.
In the internal tin process, the tin diffuses from several tin cores spread out in the 
copper matrix, including a niobium mesh. During the first stage of the heat treatment 
at a temperature less than 180 °C to avoid tin melting, the bronze is formed. The main 
advantages of the process are an easier drawing of the wire (no bronze during this phase) 
and a higher concentration of tin in bronze during the heat treatment. The effective 
filament diameters are typically around 25 gm.
The modified jelly-roll process can be considered as a less encountered variant of 
the preceding one. In this process, a niobium mesh and a copper sheet are cowound 
around the central tin cores. The niobium mesh is torn out during the drawing process, 
leading to filaments that can be considered nonconnected.
Another A15 material under industrial development: NbjAl. In connection with 
the ITER program, another A15 compound is in progress. The research concerning the 
development of this material has been mainly concentrated at JAERI [7] and ENEA. 
Results given hereafter have to be taken with caution because the state of industrial 
development of this material is much less advanced than for NbgSn.
The stoichiometric composition is metastable at room temperature and stable only at 
1940 °C. The off-stoichiometric compounds generally obtained have critical properties 
below the theoretical values (Tc = 18.9 K, Bc2 = 32 T).
Interest has converged on NbaAl owing to its better mechanical properties in compar­
ison with Nb^Sn. Its lower sensitivity to strain is illustrated in Fig. 8-4. The process used 
for the production of these strands is a jelly-roll process already mentioned for NbsSn.

8-3-3 Conductor Assembly
Whether NbTi or Nt^Sn is used as the basic superconductor, the elementary composite 
is first produced as a single wire with a number of fine filaments twisted inside a matrix 
of normal metal, generally pure copper. This wire, or strand, is characterized by its size, 
number and size of filaments, normal-to-superconductor ratio, RRR of the normal metal, 
and twist pitch. Its size is typically between a fraction of a millimeter and 1 or 2 mm, 
rarely bigger, so that its current capacity is limited to a few hundred amperes.
Such a strand can be used directly to wind coils of small size without particular con­
straints, but in large-scale applications and complex magnet configurations, additional 
requirements have to be included in the complete conductor design.
For a higher nominal current, an adequate number of strands are assembled in parallel 
in a fully transposed arrangement. For stability and quench protection, a specified amount 
of normal metal, or stabilizer, must be added to the composite. Mechanical reinforcement 
may also be needed. According to the type of cooling adopted in the magnet design, 
cooling paths, channels, or conduits must be provided in the conductor structure.
The combination of these features gives rise to a large variety of conductor config­
urations. Typical examples are shown in Fig. 8-5:
Rutherford flat cables are extensively used in accelerator magnets. To reduce AC losses 
or coupling currents, the strands can be coated with a high-resistance metal such as 
Staybrite, or an insulating thin core can be inserted in the cable.
Copper- or aluminum-clad cables are tightly assembled by a soft-soldering, rolling, 
or coextrusion process. High-purity aluminum is used for light weight but also offers 
benefits from its high electrical and thermal conductivity at low temperature.

8-4 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNETS
A large variety of technologies can be applied to the design of superconducting magnets 
to fulfill the different requirements imposed by particular applications. In each case, 
basic choices have to be made among various techniques according to the specifications 
and to relevant criteria. The general guidelines followed in a particular design are briefly 
reviewed.
8-4-1 User’s Specifications
Magnets are generally incorporated in special and often complex experimental devices 
and must conform to the physical needs of the experiment. The specifications cover 
different aspects
Magnetic field configuration. A large number of field shapes can be produced by 
different types of magnets such as solenoids, toroids, helicoids, dipoles, multipoles,
Helmholtz coils, mirror coils, or any other type of field-shaped configuration.
The field extends over a specified volume or aperture at a given strength and within 
particular tolerances with regard to field quality such as uniformity or harmonic content.
Operating mode. Because time-varying fields are the main sources of heat e Deration
in superconductors, the operating mode, whether purely DC or AC or pulsed, is of utmost 
importance for the determination of the coil characteristics. Ramp rate or cycling duty 
must be specified precisely, as well as field stability and low-noise requirements.
Long-term stability, as required in NMR devices, is currently achieved by persistent
mode operation with the use of superconducting switches.

SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNET TECHNOLOGY 331
Environmental constraints. The experimental setup in which the magnet is integrated 
may impose geometrical constraints. Access to the useful field volume must be kept 
open in the specified aperture. The available space for the magnet is often restricted, and 
the boundaries and interfaces have to be well defined. Material thickness and weight may 
impose another limitation, for example, for radiation transparency in particle detectors 
or for airborne experiments.
Limitation of stray fields by magnetic shielding may be necessary, and possible 
interactions with other parts of the system must be identified.
8-4-2 First Design Approach
From the specifications above, a preliminary design of the magnet can be drawn based on 
existing experience. The first item to be determined is the winding configuration and its 
rough dimensions to ensure that the required field performances can be reached. At this 
stage, the main parameters that will guide the next design steps are estimated, such as
• The ampere-turns needed to produce the field
• The stored energy
• The peak field in the conductor region
• An estimate of the magnetic forces and of the needed mechanical structure
• The dependence of these parameters on the average current density in the winding
8-4-3 Conceptual Choices
In order to proceed with a more complete design, a number of conceptual and technical 
choices have to be made. These are based on the characteristics found in the preliminary 
design and on constraints laid in the specifications. These choices concern several areas 
that can be separated for the analysis but are in reality closely connected and need to be 
defined as a whole.
Cooling mode. The cooling mode is a major area, for it has a direct impact on other
essential items such as the type of conductor, the winding structure, and the cryogenic 
layout.
The cooling mode can be chosen among three main techniques, depending on the 
coil geometry, on the operating temperature, and on the needed cooling efficiency as 
follows:
• Pool boiling using liquid helium storage or closed-cycle refrigeration. Helium can be 
pressurized or subcooled between 5 and 1.8 K (superfluid).
• Forced-flow internal cooling in a hollow or cable-in-conduit type of conductor. Helium 
can be two-phase or supercritical.
• Indirect cooling based on heat conduction through a compact winding from restricted 
cooling loops.
The three options must be compared with regard to their applicability from a struc­
tural and cryogenic point of view, depending on the configuration and constraints of the 

332 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
considered magnet. A major issue concerns their respective cooling efficiencies in ac­
cordance with the estimated heat generation in the winding under the specified operating 
conditions.
Pool boiling is probably the most efficient cooling mode, provided that cooling 
channels are widely distributed through the winding with part of the conductor bare and 
in direct contact with helium. However, this requires a solid and leak-tight helium vessel 
surrounding the coils, which, for large or complex systems, raises technical difficulties. 
Also, electrical insulation and mechanical strength of such a porous structure are rather 
weak and in many cases unacceptable.
Forced-flow internal cooling is also very efficient, and it permits the fabrication 
of solid and well-insulated coils without the need for a helium vessel. However, other 
difficulties appear in the fabrication of the conductor and of internal joints, and the 
cryogenic system becomes much more sophisticated.
Indirect cooling with restricted cooling loops separate from the conductor is the 
simplest scheme because it avoids the difficulties of both previous systems. However, 
its efficiency, in terms of stability margin, is sensibly lower, and it can only be used for 
reasonably low-loss magnets, which is often the case for magnets operating in a pure 
steady-state regime.
Stability criteria. The concept of stability refers to the ability of a superconducting 
magnet to operate without accidental transition to the normal state under thermal dis­
turbances. Stability conditions are determined by a balance between the heat removal 
capacity of the winding and the predictable size of losses and of other possible distur­
bances and can be evaluated by a number of stability criteria, as explained in section 8-6. 
The magnet design must incorporate an adequate stability margin, which results from a 
combination of the cooling method and of the conductor characteristics.
Quench protection. Whatever the degree of stability provided in the design, supercon­
ducting magnets must be fully protected against an accidental quench. In such a case, 
the cunent must be discharged in a time short enough to prevent an excessive temper­
ature rise due to Joule heating in the resistive conductor without inducing dangerous 
overvoltages and eventual insulation breakdowns.
Protection methods can vary considerably according to the amount of stored energy 
to be dumped and to the conductor rating in terms of nominal current and current density. 
The different methods are described in section 8-8.
Conductor characteristics. The conductor specifications combine all the conditions 
stated in the preceding paragraphs.
The superconducting material and the operating temperature are chosen according 
to the field level (peak field on the conductor). The fine structure (filament size, matrix 
composition, and subdivision) depends on the operating mode and particular field re­
quirements. The nominal current and the overall current density, which are related to the 
content of stabilizing material, are chosen in connection with the quench protection and 
stability criteria. The need for structural reinforcement is related to the force containment 
and stress distribution. The shape and assembly of the finished conductor, integrating all 

SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNET TECHNOLOGY 333
the above features as well as electrical insulation and cooling provision, are determined 
according to the type of winding and its anticipated method of fabrication.
8-4-4 Complete Design
After the main technical features have been established, the complete design is carried out 
along practical engineering techniques. The design studies cover all the aspects already 
mentioned but in a more complete and coordinated way.
Magnetic field computations. The winding geometry has to be defined precisely to 
achieve the specified field performances. According to the system complexity and to the 
required tolerances, more or less elaborate methods of calculation are needed, from sim­
ple analytical formulas to powerful computer codes. A large number of such codes, in two 
and three dimensions, are available and enable the most difficult problems to be solved.
In addition to the field map in the useful volume, the field distribution through the 
whole winding has to be calculated, for it directly affects the operating characteristics 
of the superconductor to be chosen. It also provides the Lorentz force distribution in the 
winding, which is needed for stress analysis.
Mechanical design. Three types of forces participate in the mechanical loading of 
the winding structure: the weight, the thermal stresses induced by differential thermal 
contraction between inhomogeneous materials, and the magnetic forces. All these forces 
can be calculated fairly accurately and are combined for complete stress analysis and for 
the design of the mechanical structure.
Again, according to the system complexity, this analysis can be straightforward or 
may require elaborate computer codes, that exist from many other areas of science and 
industry. Some codes are even adapted for coupled treatment of field and forces.
Especially important for superconducting magnets is the knowledge of the fine stress 
distribution in the winding and in particular at the bonds between components such as 
conductor, insulation, and structural elements. These stresses, especially shear stresses, * 
have to be kept below conservative ratings to prevent the occurrence of mechanical 
disturbances that could endanger the conductor stability, in the case of indirectly cooled 
impregnated windings.
Stability and quench protection. As already discussed for the choice of basic concepts, 
the stability behavior and the quench process have to be fully evaluated and documented 
in the final design. The relevant methods of analysis are presented in sections 8-6 and 8-8.
Cryostat and cryogenics. After the cold mass, which was the concern of the previous 
paragraphs, the design is completed with the overall cryogenic structure, including he­
lium vessels or containers, thermal shields, vacuum vessels, supports, cold box, current 
leads, cryogenic lines, and instrumentation. These items make use of available technolo­
gies, as described in other chapters of this handbook.

334 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
8-5 AC LOSSES
The zero-resistance property of superconductors is only valid under DC conditions. As 
soon as the magnetic field is changed and penetrates the superconductor, an electrical 
field appears and losses are created.
We will examine here the more common situation of composites and cables submit­
ted to transverse-varyin
uniform fields.
When the field is varied very slowly, only the hysteresis component of losses has
to be considered. It is generated inside the superconducting filaments themselves and 
depends on the size and the form of these filaments.
The need simply to increase the field of DC magnets within a reasonable time and 
the interest in pulsed magnets have resulted in consideration of another kind of loss: the
coupling current losses generated in the conducting material surroundin
the filaments.
Modern composites and cables are twisted and transposed to ensure, as far as pos­
sible, an equal balance of current between the strands and to minimize these losses. 
Schematically, on half a twist pitch, the field variation is capable of driving a so-called 
coupling current between two filaments or two strands or even two bundles of strands, 
depending on the arrangement considered.
The tightness of the different twist pitches is one of the major parameters to keep 
these coupling currents at an acceptable value by decreasing the area of the loops. The 
smallest value is established on the basis of manufacturing considerations not to damage 
the assembly at a value around ten times its size.
Another way of controlling the coupling current is to choose very resistive matrixes
and even to insulate the strands. On the other hand, the necessity of important quantities 
of pure copper to stabil ize and protect the wi res gives another 1 i mi tation, and a ki nd of bal­
ance has to be found. Studies in that field are progressing to adjust and precisely control
the contact resistance between the strands of a iven cable to calculate the best balance.
8-5-1 Superconducting Magnetization
Introduction. Bulk type-H superconductors tend to shield their inner core from any 
change of amplitude or orientation of applied field by creation of magnetization currents 
at their periphery. The distribution of magnetization currents is such that they produce 
within the superconductor a magnetic flux density Bt exactly opposite to the applied 
magnetic flux density change ABa
B] + ABa ~ 0
(8-14)
In the critical state model developed by Bean [8], the magnetization current density 
is assumed to be the superconductor critical-current density at the given field and tem­
perature. Unlike eddy currents, magnetization currents are proportional to the amplitude 
of applied field change (and not to the rate of variation), and they do not decay. They 
are also called persistent magnetization currents.
Behavior of a superconducting filament. Let us consider a rectilinear and infinite
superconductin
filament carrying no transport current and initially in a virgin state, and 
let us vary the applied field from 0 to Bo, where Bo is perpendicular to the filament axis.

Figure 8-6 Model of persistent magnetization current shells with elliptical inner boundaries [10] (a) up-ramp 
from a virgin stale, (b) full penetration, and (c) down-ramp after full penetration.
Several models have been developed to determine the persistent magnetization cur­
rent distribution. In the simplest ones [9,10], the magnetization currents flow in a shell at 
the filament periphery with an elliptical inner boundary (see Fig. 8-6(a)). As the applied 
field is increased, the ellipse eccentricity decreases until the magnetization currents fill 
up the whole filament (see Fig. 8-6(b)). The field at which this occurs is called the 
penetration field Bp o and is determined by the implicit equation
[2/lq Jc(Bp o)rr]
(8-15)
where is the permeability of vacuum, Jc is the superconductor critical-current density 
at the given temperature, and rf is the filament radius. If the external field is increased 
beyond Bp.o, the distribution of magnetization currents remains the same.
Reference [11] proposes to represent the effects of persistent magnetization currents 
by a magnetic moment per filament unit length, Mo, given by
(8-16a)
for Bq, Bq < Bp.o and
Mq = — —Jc(Bo)rf w
for Bo. Bq > 5p.o
(8-16b)
where Bq is the absolute value of Bq and u is a unit vector parallel to Bq. Let us now 
assume that, after reaching the maximum value Bo, the field is decreased from Bq to
Bi. Then, the simpler models indicate that a new shell is created at the filament periph­
ery where the magnetization currents flow in opposite directions to the magnetization 
currents in the initial shell (see Fig. 8-6(c)). Hence, the distribution is constituted by 
the overlay of two shells: a first one created during the up-ramp from 0 to Bq with 
[—yc(Bo)] magnetization currents on one side and [4- JC(BO)] magnetization currents on 
the other side, and a second shell created during the down-ramp from Bo to B\ with 
[+Jc(Bo) + ^c(Si)l magnetization currents on one side and ( — Jc(Bq) — Jc(Z?i)| mag­
netization currents on the other side. In the more sophisticated model, the contribution 
to the magnetic moment per unit filament unit length of the outermost shell, M\, is

336 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
estimated as
Mi = zMc(Bo) + Jc(Bi)1
(8-I7a)
forBpi <Bj and
Mi = ^[Jc(Bo) + Jc(Bi)]rf3«
(8-17b)
for B\ < Z?pj where Bpj is the solution of the implicit equation
Bq — Bp.i = 2 xxo[</c(^o) 4“ »/c(Bp,i)]rf
7T
(8-18)
Furthermore, the total magnetic moment per filament unit length, Mtou is simply
M[ct — Mo 4" M]
(8-19)
If, after reaching B\, the field is increased once again from B\ to B2, a third shell 
is created at the filament periphery with magnetization currents flowing in opposite 
directions to the magnetization currents of the second shell. The contribution of the third 
shell to the magnetic moment per filament unit length can be computed by changing the 
sign of Eqs. (8-17) and (8-18) and by replacing Bq by B\ and B\ by B2 in Eqs. (8-17) 
and (8-18), and so on.
In practice, to determine the magnetization state of a superconducting filament, it is 
necessary to know the history of applied field variations. Then, for each field variation, 
one determines the parameters of the persistent magnetization current shell that is created 
and sums the contributions from the various shells.
Effects of superconductor magnetization. As we have seen, magnetized filaments act 
as magnetic moments. In the case of superconducting magnets with stringent field-quality 
requirements, such as particle accelerator magnets, these magnetic moments result in 
undesirable field distortions that have to be corrected.
Let Zf designate the filament position in the complex plane, and let us introduce the 
complex magnetic moment Mtot defined as
Mtoi — M(ot y 4" i M(Ot x

where M(ot x and MtOt y 
vector Mto[.
designate the x- and y-components of the magnetic moment
The magnetic flux density Btot produced far from a magnetized filament can be
computed by representin
it by a current-line doublet, which consists of a current line
of intensity (-/) located at Zf and a current line of intensity (4-/) located at (zr 4- d),
where d is such that

where Ba.x and Bay are the x- and y-components of the applied magnetic flux density

where Re designates the real part of the expression in brackets.

with the effective penetration field Bp a given by

8-5-2 Coupling Current Losses in Composites and Cables
The conductor time constant. Schematically, when a composite is subjected to a trans­
verse uniform changing magnetic field Ba, coupling currents take place that generate a
uniform reaction field ABj in the opposite direction. The resultin internal field Bj is
the algebraic addition of these two components. It can be demonstrated that [13]:
Bj "*  Bq —H AB,
Bj = Ba — 0|o Bj
where 0IO is the time constant of the decay of the coupling currents.

338 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
It can be demonstrated that the power losses per unit of volume of filamentary zone 
due to these coupling current can be written as
Mo
(8-30)
where #iq is the time constant of the coupling current of the composite alone in space. 
If the composite is no longer alone but inserted in an assembly of given shape, the time 
constant is #20 as follows:
@20 — 2(1 —
(8-31)
where N is the demagnetization factor associated with the sample geometry. If the 
sample considered is a round cylinder, which is the case for a single multifilamentary 
composite, /V = 0.5.
For practical reasons, in certain cases, the energy and power given are related to 
the composite volume. In this case a new time constant can be defined, , which is no 
longer related to the current decay but is such that

Another time constant also has to be considered, ^2, which is related to the more 
classical eddy currents appearing in the copper shells of the composites. This component

Time constant calculations. A difficulty is to evaluate the time constant of the multi­
filamentary composites or of the conductors that are considered. The measurement of 
this time constant by magnetization or calorimetric method is not an easy task. A few 
examples are given hereafter. More details are given in Ref. (14].

Time constant of a composite. The formula given hereafter is valid only for a composite 
made of a filamentary zone surrounded by a pure copper shell with p as the twist pitch of

of the copper shell:

8-6 THERMAL STABILITY
In superconducting magnets, the conductor is subjected to different types of losses, either 
internal or external, which need to be evaluated efficiently so that the temperature remains 
below its critical characteristics. The heat transfer mechanism between the conductor and 
its cooling environment must be adapted to the size and shape of the heat disturbances 
and depends on the cooling mode adopted for the magnet. The three types of cooling 
techniques generally used lead to different heat transfer processes, and their stability 
conditions need to be analyzed separately. These cooling modes concern
• Indirectly cooled or compact impregnated coils in which the conductors are not in 
contact with the helium refrigerant. The heat is removed by pure solid conduction 
from the heated zone to the cold source either by bath or restricted cooling loops.
• Coils with cooling channels distributed through the winding in a transverse flow ar­
rangement where liquid helium is in direct contact with the conductors. The thermal
behavior of the conductor is essentially ovemed by the convective heat transfer char­
acteristics between conductor and liquid helium in the case of He I or by the heat 
transport mechanism along helium channels characteristic of He II.

SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNET TECHNOLOGY 341
• Internally cooled conductors with confined helium paths in a parallel-flow arrange­
ment, such as hollow or cable-in-conduit conductors. These are generally cooled by 
forced flow of either two-phase or supercritical helium, and their thermal behavior is 
mainly governed by the specific heat of the helium volume close to the heated area.
8-6-1 General Stability Concepts
Disturbances. Different types of internal losses, such as hysteresis and AC losses, are 
evaluated in section 8-5 with their analytical expressions. Other disturbances can arise 
from external heat or beam radiation or from mechanical instabilities created by thermal 
or electromagnetic stresses in the windings. This last source, though generally weak 
and fugitive, becomes significant in systems with low cooling efficiency such as indirect
cool in
A magnet is stable if, after a given disturbance has deposited a certain amount 
of energy in the conductor, with possible excursion into the normal state, the cooling 
medium is able to absorb the energy produced and to recover the conductor to its initial 
superconducting state and initial temperature. The aim of stability studies is to evaluate 
the balance between a disturbance spectrum (in terms of space distribution, duration, 
and amplitude) and the dynamic response of the conductor.
Thermal behavior of the conductor. The temperature distribution of a superconducting 
system is given by the heat diffusion equation and appropriate boundaiy conditions:
ar
C — = div(A ■ grad • T) 4- W 
(8-45)
at
with C as the volumetric specific heat of the solid, A as the thermal conductivity tensor, 
and W as the power dissipated per unit volume of material, including the power produced 
by the initial disturbance P(x, y, z, r) and the Joule heating in the conductor G(T). The 
latter can be expressed as
(8-46a)
G = pJ2
(8-46b)
(8-46c)
where 7b is the bath temperature, Tc the critical temperature at the operating field B, 7^ 
the transition current sharing temperature, J the overall current density in the conductor 
of cross section A, and p the equivalent electrical resistivity (p = PcuA/ACu in the case 
of a copper stabilizer).
Depending on the cooling mode, the windin
will be modeled as
• A non isotropic homogeneous three-dimensional medium (Xx Xy A.z) for impreg­
nated coils; the boundary conditions are set at the borderline of the winding (either 
bath or cooling loop).

342 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING 
»
• An isotropic one-dimensional homogeneous medium, with uniform temperature over 
a cross section, for coils in which the heat transfer to helium is dominant compared
with the heat transfer between neighboring conductors (coils with cooling channels
wetting the conductors or internally cooled cables). As a consequence of neglecting
the transverse temperature gradients and of reducing the model to one dimension,
the boundary conditions at the conductor surface are integrated in the heat diffusion 
equation as follows:
+ P(z,r) + G(T)-e(T)
(8-47)
where Q(T) represents the power evacuated by helium per unit volume of conductor.
8-6-2 Stability Criteria of Windings C
led by Helium Channels
Stekly criterion: full-recovery current (18]. By assuming a heat transfer to helium 
proportional to the temperature difference between the conductor and helium and neglect­
ing the heat flux by conduction along the conductor (which is the same as considering 
disturbances extending uniformly along the length), a dimensionless stability parameter 
can be expressed as
p42
Ahp(Tc - Tb)
(8-48)
where p is the wetted perimeter of the conductor and h the heat transfer coefficient per 
unit surface.
The stability criterion is stated as follows:
• If a < 1, the conductor is fully stable, which means that recovery is achieved at all 
currents up to the critical current.
• If a > 1, the conductor is globally stable, which means that it will recover, whatever 
the size of the disturbance, for all currents I <
This criterion can be extended to the case of nonlinear heat transfer. In this case the 
conductor is globally stable for currents below a “full-recovery current” Zr such that
G(Zr,T) < Q(T) VT
(8-49)
Equal-area Maddock criterion: cold-end recovery current. Maddock et al. [19] 
define a stability criteria by a graphical model that takes into account the longitudinal 
conduction. The conductor is assumed to be of infinite length, with the end at the bath 
temperature Tb, and both powers dissipated in the conductor and transferred to helium 
are single functions of the conductor temperature.
The conductor is globally stable, which means that it will recover after a disturbance 
has transited its entire length into the normal state, if the two surface areas a and b shown 
in Fig. 8-8(a) fulfill the condition a > b also expressed by the condition
(8-50)

Propagating Zone
The cold-end recovery current, or minimum propagating current, is the current for 
which the two areas are equal. This cold-end recovery current is higher than the previous 
full-recovery current.
Concepts of MPZ and MQE. Superconductin
magnets can in some cases operate
reliably at currents higher than the recovery current. The previous criteria were based 
on disturbances creating an infinite normal zone (global stability). For currents above 
the recovery current, the conductor can still recover if the disturbance has not exceeded 
a characteristic size (limited stability).
Wilson and Iwasa [20] have extended the equal-area theorem to the case of limited 
normal zones. For a given current above the recovery current, there is a steady tem­
perature profile with a peak temperature such that the two areas a and b shown in

344 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
Fig. 8-8(b) are equal, which satisfies the relation
[Q(T) ~ G(T)]MT)dT = 0
(8-51)
This stationary solution is called the “minimum propagating zone” (MPZ). In gen­
eral, the determination of the MPZ temperature profile calls for numerical computation. 
In the particular case of a constant thermal conductivity and of a linear heat transfer 
coefficient, Q = h(T — T^)p/A, and if the cunent-sharing zone is omitted, an analytical 
expression of the MPZ can be obtained. The peak temperature and the length of the 
normal zone are given, respectively, by

The MPZ, unstable stationary temperature distribution, provides useful indications 
about the domain of stability of the superconducting state: any energy deposition that 
develops a temperature profile above that of the MPZ leads to a growth of the normal 
zone over the entire conductor, whereas, for a disturbance generating a profile below 
that of the MPZ, the recovery to the superconducting state is practically ensured.
The energy contained in the MPZ profile is given by
(8-54)
This energy is often used as an approximate measure of the ‘‘minimum quench 
energy” (MQE), which is the minimum heat input, delivered instantaneously to a spot, 
necessary to induce a quench.
The critical energy depends on the duration and on the space distribution of the 
disturbance. For a very short disturbance, the critical energy may be smaller than the
MQE if the initial temperature profile is particularly sharp.
The concept of MPZ is also applicable to the scheme of impregnated windings.
Similar equations can be written using the heat transfer mechanism by both longitudinal 
and transverse conduction through the winding in a three-dimensional geometry. An 
unstable stationary solution is derived for the MPZ.

The stability concept of cables cooled internally by forced-flow supercritical helium 
or by pressurized superfluid helium differs from that of windings cooled by transverse 
helium channels communicating with a bath. In this case, the available helium enthalpy 
is restricted and is not replaced (within the concerned time scale). The stability is very 
sensitive to the operating temperature Top and to the temperature margin, Tcs — Top, which

where Ahc is the cross section of helium contained in the cable, A is the cross section of 
metal, and Chc is the constant-pressure volumetric heat of helium per unit volume (the 
metal enthalpy is negligible).
The stability of such a system is difficult to evaluate because the heat exchange 
between conductor and helium is strongly time-dependent. The transient heat transfer 
coefficient can be very high during a short time (a few ms), but the helium temperature 
increases rapidly during the heat pulse. The heat diffusion equation of the conductor is 
coupled, through the heat exchange, to that of helium and is usually solved by numerical 
computation.
The concept of stability margin proposed by Hoenig and Montgomery [21] as the 
“uniform heat density instantaneously deposited in a long length of conductor that just 
causes a quench,” can be used as a figure of merit for the comparison of different cable­
in-conduit conductors, The critical energy density is strongly dependent on the current, 
as shown in Fig. 8-9 [22,23]. Above a certain current, the stability margin is very small 
(ill-cooled conditions). In this region, only a small fraction of the available enthalpy, 
AHmax, is used. In order to remain in the well-cooled regime, the operating current must 
be well below this limit. If the heat transfer coefficient h is assumed to be constant, the 
limit is given by
P J2 = -h{Tt - Top) 
A
(8-56)
The current limit depends on the copper cross section (7|!m oc V4u) and on the 
strand diameterd(Zjim oc lA/d fora given overall metal cross section).

8-7 ELECTRICAL INSULATION
8-7-1 Specification
The electrical insulation of superconducting magnets must fulfill special requirements 
related to electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties. Although in steady-state DC 
operation there is no voltage across the coils, during transient periods, such as when 
ramping up and down or more particular! y i n case of emergency fast dump of the current, 
high voltages can be created in parts of the circuit and can endanger the magnet safety. 
Voltage breakdowns must be totally prevented because, in view of the large stored 
magnetic energy, they would generally lead to the destruction of the magnet.
The materials commonly used in superconducting magnets have intrinsically high 
electric properties, but, because they are also submitted to high mechanical stresses under 
thermal and magnetic constraints, great care must be taken to avoid any damage, either 
during coil construction or under operation.
8-7-2 The Different Insulation Materials
Typical breakdown voltages for materials used as electrical insulation in superconducting 
magnets are given in Table 8-3.
Phenolic resins used as varnish insulation for superconducting wires are often used 
on small SC magnets. A common commercial varnish is known as Formvar.
Because of their very high breakdown voltage and radiation resistance, thermoplas­
tic films such as polyimide [24] are widely used in SC magnets, especially in particle 
accelerators.
Fiber-re info reed epoxy
*
 compounds are very common insulating materials because 
of their relatively high mechanical properties. Furthermore, they can be used in different 
ways in manufacturing such as prepreg [251, fully cured parts, GIO and Gil, and the 
vacuum impregnation technique [26-28]. There is some scatter in the available values 
of thermal properties of epoxy resins and epoxy-based composites. This is due to the 
difference in the cross-1 ink density of the polymers and to the fiber volumetric fraction and 
orientation in the composites. At large radiative fluxes, the strength of epoxy composites 
decreases [29], Irradiation effects do not change breakdown voltage significantly [24] 
but only the mechanical properties.
* Additional information on composite materials can be found in chapter 2 of this handbook.
Liquid helium sometimes has a part in the insulation of bath coils.
The case of NbjSn magnets has to be considered separately. Because the thermal 
cycle required to synthesize the superconducting NbsSn phase is done at hi gh temperature 
(660-700°C), polymer insulation cannot be used before the thermal cycle. Usually 
glass fiber is used as a spacer during the thermal cycle and is followed by a vacuum 
impregnation. Both NbaSn phase and glass fiber are very brittle after the cycle, and so 
the process needs special care.

8-7-3 Temperature Dependence of the Insulation Material Properties
The problem for organic insulation materials is to match the thermal contraction dif­
ference that exists between metallic parts and insulation. Typical values of integrated 
thermal contraction from 293 to 4.2 K are presented in Table 8-3.
Thermoplastic polymer films, such as polyimide, lead to some problems in pre­
stressed magnets due to the creep of the thermoplastic at room temperature. Preliminary 
tests to measure the creep are often needed for the design of prestressed coils.
Organic polymers used as matrix for composite insulation are usually brittle at room 
temperature because of their high cross-link density, but the rupture strain of the fibers 
is lower than the one of the matrix. At cryogenic temperature the contrary is observed 
[301, the first failure occurring in the matrix. Therefore, the rupture strain of the polymer 
is the limiting criterion for its use at cryogenic temperature. Because, as in a composite, 

348 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
the strain is the same for both matrix and fiber, only the strain limitation should be taken 
into consideration in the mechanical analysis Failure mechanisms of brittle matrix com­
posites have been extensively studied At liquid helium temperature, the failure strain 
of the polymer occurs between 0 8 and 1 15% This failure strain is on the same order 
as the differential thermal contraction between the polymeric and metallic materials, 
which means that the remaining strain margin of a superconducting coil in the operat­
ing conditions is small The energy released by the failure or cracks of the polymer 
matrix is a type of disturbance that can affect the conductor stability as mentioned in 
section 8-6
The difference between the integrated thermal contraction of metals and composite 
materials often leads to high calculated shear stresses at the insulation-conductor inter­
face This is due to the fact that the calculation considers an equivalent elastic modulus 
for the composite insulation, which is dominated by the high fiber modulus Actually, the 
bonding occurs between the polymer matrix of low modulus and the metal Therefore, 
the actual shear stresses at the metal interface are much lower
The breakdown voltages of hehum [31] decrease approximately by a factor of 2 
when it changes from the liquid to the gaseous state, as shown in Table 8 3 Further 
decrease is observed as the temperature of the gas increases, the breakdown voltage 
varying with the temperature reciprocal Therefore, the part played by helium in the 
insulation must be limited and carefully controlled
8-7-4 Influence of the Cooling Technique on the Insulation
The cooling mode of the magnet plays an important role in the design of the insulation
Magnets receiving large radiative fluxes, or which have to remove important losses, 
often require a direct contact between the cryogenic fluid and the conductor This can 
be realized in bath coils with bare conductors or more commonly nowadays with porous 
insulation using polyimide films and glass fiber ribbons that allow helium flow through 
the porosity of the fiber cloth Magnets using internally cooled conductors do not lead 
to specific problems The radiation resistance of the polymer is the limiting criterion for 
the use of organic material in magnets receiving large particle fluxes
For magnets using indirect cooling systems, the thermal conductivity of the insu­
lation must be high, and the bonding between the conductor and the insulation must be 
strong In particular, shear stresses between conductors and between the coil and its 
cooling structure must be kept at a low level
Extrapolation of thermal properties from 4 2 to 1 8 K should be avoided because of 
the increase of thermal resistivity due to the Kapitza effect *
8-7-5 Impregnated Superconducting Coils
Because vacuum impregnation using epoxy resm is a very common technique for in­
sulation, some remarks have to be written on it The vacuum impregnation technique 
’Sec chapter 10 of this handbook

SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNET TECHNOLOGY 349
requires the use of a very low viscosity resin [32,331 The impregnation process is 
possible if the viscosity is lower than 200 mPa s Because vacuum is used to ease the 
resin flow through the glass fiber cloth, the following requirements have to be taken into 
accoun t
• The use of solvent to reduce the viscosity of the resin-hardener mixture has to be 
avoided
• The vacuum has to be controlled to avoid the evaporation of the hardener during the 
impregnation process
There is always a risk of bubble formation using this technique Most of the studies 
[281 done on vacuum impregnation for superconducting magnets are based on Darcy’s 
law that relates the flow of the liquid in the porous insulation to the pressure gradient
appearm
in the liquid
Although this represents the liquid flow well, it neglects the
wetting phenomenon at the liquid-solid-vacuum interface Because epoxy resin has
excellent wettin
properties on metallic surfaces and glass fibers, the metallic surfaces 
and glass fibers have to be well outgassed, otherwise, the epoxy will first dissolve the 
gas molecules absorbed on the surfaces The dissolved gases in the liquid resin will 
form bubbles, creating regions of reduced *hermal  conductivity after curing Outgassing 
conditions prior to the resin impregnation are therefore of major importance If vacuum 
impregnation is well executed, the monolithic structure that is finally realized does not 
allow any movement of the conductor inside the coil
8-8 QUENCH PROTECTION
In the event of a quench, and if no appropriate measures were taken, a magnet could be 
endangered by overheating owing to the high level of current density in the supercon­
ductor Although the superconducting magnets are designed with an adequate level of 
stability with respect to disturbances affecting the windings, the probability of under­
going quenches cannot be altogether precluded An accidental quench may originate, 
for instance, from the loss of liquid helium as a result of cryogenic failure or of vacuum 
failure Therefore, the design of the magnets and the conception of their protection 
systems must allow the magnets to quench safely
Because the basic process of a quench is the conversion of the magnetic energy into 
heat inside the volume of winding transited into the resistive state, all protection tech­
niques consist in decreasing the current as fast as possible (i e , without the appearance 
of overvoltages across or through the windings) The most common technique entails 
discharging the energy into an external resistor
8-8-1 Quench Mechanism
The quench is characterized by the irreversible transition of a zone of the conductor 
from the superconducting state to the normal (resistive) state The heat dissipated in 
the initial zone by the Joule effect due to the magnet current entails warming up to the 
critical temperature of the surrounding volumes, which quench in turn, resulting in a

350 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
continuous expansion of the normal zone. The propagation of the quench is 
by heat diffusion determined by the thermal conductivities of the materials.
overned
Longitudinal propagation velocity of the normal zone. In an isolated superconducting 
wire, the normal zone expands along the conductor, under the combined actions of heat 
conduction and ohmic effect, at a constant velocity
(8-57)
where J is the conductor current density and C and p, respectively, are the averaged
specific heat and resistivity of the whole conductor at the critical temperature Tc.
Transverse propagation velocity of the normal zone. In a winding, the normal zone 
also expands in the directions perpendicular to the conductor resulting from the heat 
diffusion across the insulation. The transverse velocities are much slower because they 
are also proportional to the square root of the thermal conductivities in those directions, 
which are principally determined by the thermal conductivity and the thicknesses of the 
insulation. The equivalent conductivity in the transverse direction is
= —Aj 
(8-58)
where A] is the insulation thermal conductivity and e and et the conductor and insulation 
thickness in the transverse direction, respectively.
The velocity in the transverse direction is then
— Vj
(8-59)
Current diffusion: Effect on velocity. When the conductor quenches, the current is
expelled from the superconductin material and is diffused into the surrounding stabilizer
where, after a transient phase, its density becomes uniform. A characteristic time of the
diffusion phase can be defined as
rm — /tt Dm
(8-60)
where is the transverse dimension of the stabilizer and Dm the magnetic diffusivity
During that period, the current in the stabilizer, bein
restricted to
a smaller area, dissipates more power than with a uniform density. As a result, the
propagation velocity of the normal zone can be much faster than that iven by Eq. (8-57),
which is benificial for protection, as seen in section 8-8-3.
8-8-2 Maximum Temperature and Voltage
Maximum temperature. Though there is no strict limit for the temperature rise, the 
usual designed value is of the order of 100 K. The reason is that because all the materials

enterin the coil structure have almost no thermal expansion when warmed up from liquid
helium temperature to 100 K, no significant thermal stresses appear in the windings. For
the same reason, it is also advantageous to keep a low thermal
radient throughout the
windings. Table 8-4 compares the thermal expansions from 4 to 100 K and from 100 to 
293 K for usual coil materials.
Maximum voltage. In superconducting magnets, the thickness of the insulation may 
have to be limited because of different constraints such as cooling efficiency or thermal 
stability.
In some cases, parts of the conductor or of the current leads are exposed to liquid 
or gaseous helium, which have rather weak dielectric properties (the breakdown voltage 
of helium at 300 K is only about 300 V/mm). For these reasons, voltages created during 
the quench process have to be kept as low as possible. A practical limit is often taken on 
the order of 500 to 1000 V, The peak voltage does not appear necessarily at the magnet 
terminals but can be across part of the winding that has not yet transited to the normal 
state. This has to be determined in each particular case.
Hot spot criterion. The hot spot temperature is easily estimated from the knowledge 
of the current decay with time if we assume local adiabaticity. This assumption is a fair 
approximation because the quench time is short, but in all cases it is conservative. The

The function U contains only the properties of the materials used in the winding and 
therefore has a universal validity allowing the determination of the final temperature Tm 
of the hot point. Figure 8-10 shows the function U for copper, aluminum, and a typical 
winding made of a copper-NbTi monolithic conductor impregnated with epoxy resin. 
The conspicuous effectiveness of the residual resistivity of the materials should be noted.

An upper limit of the hot spot temperature is readily obtained with the two following 
assumptions:
There is no propagation of the quench (internal resistance is negligible). 
The magnet energy is dumped through a constant external resistor R.
In this case the decay of the current is exponential with the time constant r =s 1/J? (L 
being the magnet inductance). Thus

where Jo is the initial current density at t = 0.
Fora magnet whose stored energy is E, if the rated current Io and the dump voltage
V across the magnet terminals are chosen, the current density Jo is determined by the
maximum Tm allowed for the peak temperature according to the following equation:
(8-64)
During a quench and the following discharge, the internal resistance of the magnet 
increases by the normal zone propagation and the Joule heating. Therefore, the decrease 
of the current is faster than that without propagation, and the value of the integral 
of Eq. (8-63) is lower. Consequently, the final hot spot temperature is lower than that 
calculated with Eq. (8-63), particularly when the current density is high. Equation (8-62) 
is still valid if the actual current decay is known by calculation or measurement.
To predict the peak temperature, calculations with the help of elaborate computer 
codes are needed. There are a large number of such codes generally developed for specific 
applications such as the following:

SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNET TECHNOLOGY 353
• The program QUENCH [35] includes the normal zone expansion with the velocities 
entered as input parameters. The resistance and the heat capacity of the windings 
are calculated from the individual constituent characteristics versus temperature in­
troduced as data in the computer code The temperature of the successive quenching 
volumes is calculated at each step of time, yielding the final hot spot temperature.
• Codes of thermal diffusion in three dimensions using the finite element method are 
available. The geometry of the conductor, of the coils, of the coil structure, and the 
properties of all the materials are given in input. The programs can describe the 
evolution of the quench with time and compute the characteristics of the process such 
as propagation velocities in the three directions, temperature distribution through the 
windings and the structures, resistances, voltages, energies, and so forth.
Quench back. The decay of the magnet current during its discharge into the dump 
resistor produces a magnetic flux variation throughout the coils and their structures. In 
the conductor, as described in section 8-5, coupling currents and eddy currents generate 
losses. In the coil mechanical structures made of low resistive material, such as aluminum 
alloy, the eddy currents may reach large intensities and generate enough heat to cause the 
quench of other coil parts still in the superconducting state. These quench-back processes 
can result in very fast growth of the coil resistance; a significant fraction of the stored 
energy is dissipated rather evenly inside the windings with smooth temperature gradients 
and reduced peak temperatures.
8-8-3 Protection Techniques
Quench detector. When a quench occurs, a resistive voltage appears that has to be
detected in any phase of the magnet operation (rampin up, steady-state current, ramping
down). The quench signal, whose detection threshold is usually of the order of 1 V, must 
be extracted from the coil inductive voltage, which is one or two orders of magnitude 
greater. To eliminate the inductive voltage, mainly two types of quench detectors are 
utilized.
The first type, shown in Fig. 8-11(a), uses a resistor bridge circuit. It needs an 
electrical tap in the magnet winding. The bridge has to be balanced under the sole 
inductive voltages of the two magnet parts (at the first ramping up). Therefore, the 
unbalanced current iq is proportional to the resistive voltage appearing in one part of the
magnet.

(b)
Figaro 8*11 Resistive (a) and inductive (b) quench detectors.

Self-protected magnet.
The second type, shown in Fig. 8-11(b) consists of an electronic device subtract­
ing the inductive voltage part from the total magnet voltage. The inductive voltage is 
measured by means of a secondary coil coupled to the magnet.
Protection circuit schemes. The systems of protection depend on the magnet designs. 
Several schemes of protection circuits are shown in Figs. 8-12 to 8-15 according to the 
magnet features.
Protection of small compact magnets. For small impregnated magnets of low energies 
(hundreds of kilojoules) and high current densities (hundreds of amperes per square 
millimeter), there is no need of a quench detector because the internal resistance rapidly 
reaches a high value. Figure 8-12 shows the protective circuit: there is no breaker, and 
the power source has its proper protective system against output overvoltage. In the event 
of a quench, the power source is switched off, and the current is discharged through the 
free-wheel diode of the source. Nevertheless, a protective resistor must be mounted In 
parallel across the magnet to prevent the destructive damage caused by a line rupture.
External resistor. As soon as a quench originates, the stored energy is extracted outside 
the magnet windings into an external resistor by the opening of breaker(s) triggered by the
quench detector. From the point of view of magnet protection, the two circuits shown in 
the following figures are equivalent. In Fig. 8-13(a), the resistor is connected in parallel
Figure 8-13 Protection by (a) external parallel 
and (b) series resistor.

resistor.
across the magnet directly between the current lead terminals. Such an arrangement 
ensures the full safety of the magnet against any external failure. In Fig. 8-13(b) the 
resistor is in series with the magnet with a breaker connected in parallel. This arrange­
ment does not protect the magnet from severe damage in the event of a rupture of the 
electrical line or of the power supply. It has the advantage that the currents of the magnet 
and of the source are always equal with no current derived in parallel.
Internal subdivided resistor. The resistor is subdivided into elements located inside 
the cryostat and connected in parallel across the magnet sections, as shown in Fig. 8-14. 
If a magnet section quenches, the resistor element in parallel provides a shunting path 
for the current, thus tempering the thermal effects in this section. However, such a 
scheme can entail an imbalance of forces between sections, which in some cases is not 
acceptable.
Segmented external resistor. For the magnets with large stored energies, when the 
discharge voltage Rio is too high (e g., several thousand volts), the external resistor is 
segmented into elements that are connected between the magnet coils, as in Fig. 8-15. 
Breakers are mounted in parallel with each resistor. With n segments, the elements have 
a resistance r = R/n, and the voltage is limited to ±R1q/h all along the magnet during 
the discharge. The main disadvantage is to multiply the number of current leads.
Quench propagators. Quench propagators such as heaters or thermally conductive 
strips can be placed in the windings to initiate quenches in all parts of the magnet as soon 
as a quench is detected. The aim of such devices is to propagate the quench artificially 
in order that the heat released be distributed evenly throughout the magnet at a uniform 
temperature without creating a high peak temperature. Because the complete magnet 
reverts to the normal state, its resistance reaches a high value, so that most of the stored 
energy is dissipated in the magnet. The role of the external dump resistor as energy 
extractor becomes negligible, and therefore it can even be lowered to zero (e.g., by
Figure 8-15 Protection by segmented external resistor.

356 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
Figure 8-16 The Aleph solenoid
means of diodes). This technique, also named the internal dump technique, seems to be 
the sole method suitable for very big magnets whose stored energies are huge—several 
tens of gigajoules—because it solves the high voltage problem and avoids the need for 
bulky and expensive dump resistors of so large a thermal capacity.
8-9 SOME APPLICATIONS
Several applications using superconducting magnets have been widely developed,mainly
in the field of fundamental research.
1. High-magnetic field generators that can use superconducting coils only (up to24T) 
or a hybrid set of superconducting and copper coils.
2. High-energy particle accelerators such as the Tevatron at Fermi Lab (USA) in service 
since 1983 [36], HERA at DESY (Germany) put in operation in 1991 [37], and LHC 
(the Large Hadron Collider) at CERN (Switzerland-France), the start up of which is
scheduled during the year 2005 f38]-
3. Particle detectors associated with very large accelerators. Among many are solenoids
Cello [39] and Hl at DESY, solenoids Aleph (Fig. 8-16 and [40]) and Delphi at CERN,
and the future projects of ATLAS toroid [41] and Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)
[42] to be installed on the LHC.

4. Plasma fusion devices, mainly using tokamak machines. The Tore Supra tokamak 
(CEA—EURATOM) has been in operation since 1989 [43]. The ITER tokamak, result 
of a worldwide collaboration, is under engineering design [44].
The most developed industrial application of superconducting magnets is their use 
in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices for medical scanners. The specific char­
acteristics of the superconducting magnets used in these applications are summed up in 
Tables 8-5 (main specifications) and 8-6 (conceptual choices).
Following the completion of very successful projects, the most ambitious projects 
in each field by the beginning of 1997 are listed below.
1. For high magnetic field generation, the 45-T project of the National High Magnetic 
Field Laboratory (NHMFL) at Florida State University (USA). The 45-T field in a 
32-mm bore diameter is produced using a hybrid magnet system [45] with field 
contributions by the resistive insert and the superconducting outset of 31 and 14 T, 
respectively
The superconducting outsert magnet contains three separate subcoils, two using 
NbgSn cable-in-conduit conductor and one using NbTi cable-in-conduit conductor. 
The cryostat has a 2.4-m outer diameter and a 2.5-m height. This system is expected 
to be tested by the end of 1998.
2. For high energy accelerator, the LHC project will use a 27-km circumference with 
1200 twin-aperture dipoles, 14.2-m long, with a central field of8.35T, and 380 twin­
aperture quadrupoles, 3.1-m long, with a field gradient of 220T/m (Fig. 8-17). All 
magnets will work at 1.8 K to accelerate two proton beams up to an energy of7000 Gev,

which will later collide at four points. This project has very new features compared 
with previous superconducting particle accelerators in operation:
(a) High magnetic field and forces in the magnets,
(b) Twin-aperture structure (two magnetic elements of the same structure are put in 
the same cryostat),
(c) Use of superfluid helium on very large distances,
(d) High-beam losses due to the luminosity of the machine.
3. For particle detectors, the size of the detector follows the accelerator’s size. The next 
two most important projects for LHC will be the following:
(a) The ATLAS magnet system, which consists of three parts:
(1) An inner thin solenoid producing a magnetic induction of 2T in a cylinder 
5-m long and 2.5-m in diameter,
(2) The barrel toroid, composed of eight coils inside their own cryostats (Fig. 8-18). 
The main characteristics of the toroid are an inner bore of 9.4 m, an outer bore

of 20.1 m, an axial length of 25.3 m, a peak field on the conductor of 4T, and 
a stored energy of 1.1 GJ,
(3) The two end cap toroids with an outer diameter of 11 m and an axial length 
of 5.6 m providing a bending power in the range 4-8T • m.
(b) The CMS solenoid, for which a magnetic field of 4T in a 5.9-m free warm bore
and a 12.4-m length is requested. This solenoid will be the biggest with the largest 
stored energy (2.5 GJ) ever built.
Both projects are under detail design and are expected to be put in operation on 
the LHC during the year 2005.
4. For plasma fusion, the ITER project has the objective of achieving a controlled ig­
nited burn time of 1000 s with a nominal fusion power of 1500 MW, The machine is 
a tokamak with a toroidal geometry and a plasma major radius of 8.15 m (Fig. 8-19). 
The superconducting magnetic system consists of
(a) 20 toroidal D-shaped coils that produce the main confining field. The maximum 
field of 12.5T on the conductor imposes the use of NbsSn. The conductor is 
a 60-kA cable-in-conduit one cooled by supercritical helium at 4.5 K. The total 
stored energy for the toroidal system is 100 GJ.

SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNET TECHNOLOGY 361
(b) A central solenoid, that induces and maintains the plasma current. This winding 
is 12-m high with a mean radius of 2.3m. The maximum field of 13T on the 
conductor also imposes the use of a 45-kA NbsSn cable.
(c) The poloidal coils, which control the plasma position and shape. Two coils, op­
erating at a field up to 8T, use a Nb^Sn conductor Three others, operating at a 
lower field, use a NbTi conductor. The coil diameter ranges from 13 to 32 m.
Presently in an engineering design phase, the project is expected to be followed by 
a construction phase, which will last for about 10 years.
5. For magnetic resonance imaging, superconducting magnets using NMR phenomena 
for medical imaging have been the first large-scale commercial application of su­
perconductivity. Practically all the systems with a magnetic field larger than 0.35T 
use a superconducting magnet, and about 10,000 such systems are now in operation 
worldwide.
Being operated in persistent mode (the magnet is short-circuited on itself), these
magnets can have a very high long-term field homogeneity and stability. Such a devel­
opment has enabled an evolution of the conceptual design of these magnets, now smaller, 
lighter, and less helium-consuming than ten years ago. The evolution is still going on 
with the development of open magnetic systems permitting access to the patient during 
examination and the use of more and more performing cryocoolers.

9-1 CRYOGENIC TRANSFER SYSTEMS
9-1-1 Introduction
Many concerns in the design of ambient and higher-temperature systems are also com­
mon to cryogenic fluid transfer systems. For ex am pie, correlations developed for ambient 
temperature fluids for pressure drop through valves, fittings, and pipes apply to cryo­
genic fluids as well. The contribution that valves and fittings make to the total system 
pressure drop, however, is sometimes not well recognized.
*
 Because in many cases this 
contribution dominates, it is important to consider all sources of pressure loss. Some 
specific cryogenic design considerations are
1. Optimization of the heat leak to the transfer line. The quality of transfer line insulation 
is primarily an economic problem of minimizing the sum of the capital cost (of the 
insulation system) and the operations cost (incurred by the heat leak, taking into 
account the duty cycle). Large-diameter or low-duty-cycle LNG and LN2 lines are 
often insulated with glass or plastic foam, whereas liquid helium and liquid or slush 
hydrogen are vacuum insulated with MLI^—sometimes with a vapor-cooled or liquid- 
nitrogen-cooled shield. In general, the lower the temperature, the better the insulation 
required, because the refrigeration is more expensive.
•For example, reports in the 1970s from two different sources indicated that the friction factor for liq­
uid and supercritical helium was anomalously high—by a factor of 1-1/2 to 2. These reports were based on 
measurements of the overall pressure drop—with some correction for bends and fittings—of large,complex he­
lium flow loops. Subsequent, more controlled measurements with simpler configurations by other investigators 
f 1,2), however, demonstrated no anomalous effect for helium.

2. Cavitation and two-phase flow. When cryogens are transferred with little subcooling, 
two-phase flow may occur at positions where the pressure falls below saturation 
owing to the combined effects of pressure drop and heat transfer. Cavitation may 
occur locally in the low-pressure regions of flowmeters and valves with the vapor 
bubbles collapsing in the pressure recovery regions of these devices [3].
3. Thermal-acoustic oscillations. Helium and slush hydrogen systems are susceptible 
to thermal-acoustic oscillations in pressure taps, valve stems, and other conduits 
with large length-to-diameter ratios that traverse between these ciyogens and ambient 
temperature. The oscillations can have heat pumping rates on the order of watts; their 
frequency is typically tens of hertz.
4. Pressure collapse and low-frequency pressure oscillations. Slush hydrogen and sub­
cooled liquid croygen flow systems are susceptible to pressure collapse in relief valve 
standpipes, valve stems, and so forth, in which a temperature-stratified layer of liquid 
maintains the subcooling pressure on the flow system. If flow turbulence disturbs the 
stratification, the pressure collapses as vapor condenses on the slush or subcooled 
cryogen. The cryogen then surges into the warmer regions of the pipe, where it 
flashes, causing a pressure pulse. The resulting low-frequency oscillations can pump 
large quantities of heat into the cryogen.
5. Negative gauge pressures. Systems at negative gauge pressure, such as slush hy­
drogen and pumped helium, are susceptible to contamination by air and water va­
por that enter through leaky valve stems, relief valves, and pipe joints. These leaks 
may plug relief valve lines with ice and solid air. Air, if it reaches the cryogen, 
frequently condenses in submicron-size particles, giving hydrogen and helium a 
milky appearance. Because these crystals have settling times of hours or longer, 
they are easily transported throughout a system. They tend to collect in stagnant 
zones, such as downstream of valve seats, where they may block the flow. In hy­
drogen systems, accumulated oxygen crystals represent a potential safety hazard. 
Special precautions such as the use of welded-bellows valve packing and avoidance 
of compression fittings (welded or soldered joints are preferred) can reduce these 
problems.
6. Thermal contraction. Contraction of stainless steel from ambient to cryogenic tem­
peratures is about 0.003 in./in., which, on a 100-ft length of pipe, is 3.6 in. Bellows 
placed periodically along straight pipe runs, are used to eliminate thermal cool-down 
stresses. On lengths up to several feet, thermal contraction can be accommodated with 
bends on smaller-diameter lines.
7. Trapped line segments. Segments of cryogenic piping that can be isolated between 
valves must be provided with relief valves to prevent rupturing the line by trapped 
cryogens as they warm up. The isometric pressure rise experienced by liquid nitrogen 
warming to 300 K, for example, is about 2900 bat.
Valves. Figures 9-1 and 9-2 illustrate typical cryogenic valves. Thin-wall stainless steel 
valve stems and vacuum jackets minimize the heat leak to the cryogen. Enclosing the 
valve stem in a stainless steel sheath allows an all-welded construction, which assures 
integrity of the vacuum insulation and makes replacement of the valve plug easy. The 
annular space between the valve stem and its sheath is typically 0.1 mm or less to 
prevent convection and its associated heat leak. Valve plugs are typically fabricated

the possibility of thermoacoustic oscillations and leaks into subatmospheric systems.

Bellows and corrugated lines are common in cryogenic piping systems—both for 
accommodating thermal contraction and for making flexible sections. Measured values 
for the pressure drop of gaseous nitrogen, liquid nitrogen, and He II flowing through 
corrugated bellows are about four times higher than through tubing of the same internal 
diameter [7]. One manufacturer of flexible transfer lines gives pressure drops a factor 
of three higher based on nominal pipe sizes. Data specific to a particular configuration 
should be used when they are available.

Near-critical-flow conditions frequently occur in helium systems because of the low 
critical pressure of helium (pc — 2.2 x 105 Pa, Tc = 5.2 K). Forced-flow helium cooling 
systems, particularly, may operate in the near-critical region. If the thermodynamic path 
of a fluid operating in this regime crosses the transposed critical line,

experience large changes in density that render Eq. (9-1) inaccurate. Arp [9] derived 
generalized flow equations for one-dimensional, single-phase flow. These equations are 
independent of the equation of state and use thermodynamic parameters that are only 
weakly divergent across the transposed critical line. Arp's generalized pressure drop

Slush hydrogen. Slush hydrogen is a slurry of liquid and solid hydrogen at or near its 
triple point (para-hydrogen triple-point temperature — 13.803 K, triple-point pressure =

7.04 kPa) and has been considered as an advanced aerospace propellant because of the 
advantages it offers in storability and cooling capacity [10-14]. Slush hydrogen with a 
60% solid fraction is 16.5% more dense than normal-boiling-point (NBP) liquid, and its 
enthalpy is 86.2 J/g less (compared to a latent heat of vaporization of 445.5 J/g at the 
NBP). Although somewhat difficult to generate continuously in large quantities, slush 
hydrogen is readily transferred through well-insulated cryogenic transfer lines and can 
be pumped with a centrifugal pump so long as the minimum pump passages exceed 
about 7 mm [10,14], Considered on a volume basis, the latent heat of fusion of solid 
hydrogen is approximately the same as the latent heat of vaporization of liquid helium, 
and thus “helium quality” thermal insulation is recommended. Figure 9-10 summarizes 
the results of measurements of the friction factor of slush hydrogen made in a 16.6-mm- 
diameter by 15-m-long straight test section [10,11 ]. At low flow velocities and high solid 
fractions, the friction factor of slush is nearly twice that of the liquid; at higher velocities 
and lower solid fractions, the slush friction factor is lower than that of the liquid. Similar 
reductions in friction factor have been observed in other slurry flows [15].
Thermal acoustic oscillations (TAOs). Thermal acoustic oscillations are common to 
helium [16-22] and slush hydrogen systems [23-25] but can also occur in nitrogen, 
oxygen, and argon systems [26] if the cold end of the tube in which the oscillations occur 
is immersed below the liquid level. These spontaneous oscillations, which pump large 
quantities of heat into a cryogenic environment, occur when a large temperature gradient 
exists in a slender tube connecting ambient and cryogenic temperatures. Rott’s original 
analysis of the problem [27,28], which assumed a step change in temperature along the 
tube, has been modified by Gu [29,30] using a steep but continuous temperature profile 
based on experiment. Gu’s stability map for a 1-m-long helium-filled tube, Fig. 9-11, 
was verified by experiment. For lengths other than 1 m, use a corrected tube radius 
r' = r/\fL, If additional volume is present at the warm end, correct the warm-to-cold 
length ratio using = (Lh + L^)/LQy where and Lc are the actual lengths of the 
warm and cold sections, respectively, and is the equivalent length of the additional 
volume. It is calculated using Lhs — Vs/xr1 2, where Vs is the additional volume and 
r is the tube radius. Al the left stability boundary in Fig. 9-11, the viscous boundary 
layer fills the tube, damping the oscillation. At the right stability boundary, the thermal 
boundary layer area is insufficient to pump enough heat to sustain the oscillation against 
frictional losses.
1. Helmholtz Resonator
The Helmoltz resonator is an extra volume connected to the closed end of an oscillating 
tube that increases the volume of the warm end. The stability curve of Rott shows that 
the most susceptible configuration occurs when f = 1. Therefore, if the volume and 
length of the warm end are increased to make f >> 1, the stability curve will move up 
and to the right in Fig. 9-11 and increase the area of the stability region. For example, 
a Helmholtz resonator was used to eliminate oscillations in a pressure tap of a slush 
hydrogen system (31 ]. Figure 9-12 shows this scheme.
If a tube geometry that lies in the unstable region of Fig. 9-11 cannot be avoided, 
several methods for damping the oscillations are available, as summarized by Gu [30]:

2. Wire in Tube
Figure 9-11 also shows that the volume of a resonator can be greatly reduced if a copper 
wire is inserted inside the warm end of the tube. Nylon fish line is also effective in 
damping oscillations [31].
3. Low-Pressure Check Valve
A low-pressure check valve effectively dampens TAOs in a vent line [31]. With the 
check valve closed, the vent line acts as a closed cold-end tube in which no oscillations 
will occur. This approach is usually used when the oscillation pressure is as high as 
1 to 2 psi.

tions (from Ref [311)

378 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
4. Perforation in the Cold Section of the Tube
Thermal acoustic oscillations can also be damped significantly by drilling a number
of holes in the cold portion of the tube. The holes decrease the effective length of the 
tube in the cold chamber. If holes are drilled close to the warm-cold interface, the
effective length of the cold portion is reduced to nearly zero. As noted from Fig. 9-11, 
the greatest stability is achieved when $ approaches zero.
5. Heat-Sinking of Vent Tube
Stability can be achieved either by cooling or heating the closed end of the tube,
depending on the location of the operation point (i.e., by changin
the temperature
rh/rc).
6. Connection of the Vent and Fill Lines
From the observations of Clement [17] it is apparent that oscillations will not occur if 
both ends of the tube are open. This condition can be approximated by interconnecting 
the vent and fill lines, which is an effective technique if both the fill and vent lines are 
maintained at atmospheric pressure.
Thermally induced flow oscillations (density-wave oscillations) may occur in su­
percritical and two-phase flow systems if the system is operating in a regime where 
the fluid undergoes large density changes on heating (e.g., a thermodynamic path that 
crosses the transposed critical line). Chugging-type flow that one hears on cool-down 
of an open-ended transfer line is an example. The oscillations can also occur, however, 
in quasisteady flow of supercritical helium, with temperature oscillations of several K, 
as illustrated in Fig. 9-13 [32].
The phase (or space lag) between the inlet and outlet flows that is required for 
oscillatory instability in a heated conduit can be understood by referring to Fig. 9-14, 
assuming a simple incompressible flow model (which considers thermal expansion, but 
no pressure effects) with a large exit flow impedance. Focusing attention on the exit 
restriction, we note that the velocity at this point is given by
(9-8)
When warmer than average fluid (lower density) arrives at the exit restriction, the velocity 
increases and the fluid in the line accelerates to satisfy continuity. The residence time
of the fluid in the heated section decreases, resulting in less heatin per unit mass and
hence in cooler fluid being delivered to the exit restriction after some time lag. As the 
cooler fluid flows through the exit restriction, the fluid in the heated section decelerates.
givin
it an increased residence time and greater-than-average heating. Thus, a positive 
perturbation in the exit temperature induces a negative perturbation or reflection that 
arrives at the exit after the transit time of the fluid in the line. The period of oscillation 
is twice the transit time, and the mass flow rate at the inlet and exit is 180° out of phase.
This phase difference results because, in the absence of pressure effects, the inlet and
exit velocities are in phase, makin
the inlet mass flow m^ proportional to 1^/pd (i-e.,
mb » Vb Vd » VI /pd)- According to Eq. (9-8), however, the exit mass flow, is
proportional to givin
the 180° phase shift between inlet and exit mass flow rates.

9-2 PUMPS
9-2-1 Introduction
Cryogenic pumps, which are now commonplace, commercially available products, are
used both for transferrin
liquid and slush cryogens between vessels and for circulating
liquid and supercritical cryogens around coolant loops. When feasible, pressure transfer 
is the easiest, most cost-effective method of transfer. Pumps are often preferred for 
larger systems but are required for systems with a receiver pressure greater than the 
supply pressure.
Positive displacement pumps are best suited for high pressure rises and low flow
rates. Available piston pumps give pressure rises of over 700 bar. Centrifugal pumps are 
favored for lower head rises and higher flow rates, although pumps with capacities as 

CRYOGENIC EQUIPMENT 381
low as 0.1 L/s are feasible (33|. Axial flow pumps have been used to circulate cryogens, 
but their use is restricted to situations that require only the very low head these pumps 
produce. Fountain effect pumps (discussed in chapter 10) are used to transfer superfluid 
helium in the zero-# environment of space [34). They can operate with a zero net positive 
suction head and have no moving parts.
The overall efficiency p of a pump is the ratio of its hydraulic power to the input 
power,

(9-10)
where Q is the volumetric flow rate, H is the head rise across the pump, 
Pg
P2 ~ Pi
(9-11)
and A/is is the isentropic enthalpy rise.
The term transfer efficiency is sometimes used to describe pump transfer systems. 
It is the ratio of the fluid delivered to the fluid consumed (the difference being the boil- 
off due to pump and transfer line losses). Although somewhat useful in defining total 
system performance, the transfer efficiency is not a good indicator of pump performance 
because it depends as much on the thermodynamic state at the pump inlet (i.e., the degree 
of subcooling) as it does on the pump efficiency.
Cavitation, the formation of vapor in the flow stream when the local pressure in a 
pump falls below the local saturation pressure by some necessary amount owing to flow 
acceleration, causes a reduction in the developed head of a pump and may erode pump 
components, such as impellers and inducers. The magnitude of the depression in the 
pressure below saturation pressure that induces cavitation depends on the thermodynamic 
and transport properties of a particular fluid [35,36]. The difference between the pump 
inlet pressure and the inlet saturation pressure (expressed in terms of head) is the net 
positive suction head (NPSH). The NPSH required to prevent cavitation in a pump 
depends on the pump type, construction, operating conditions, and fluid.
9-2-2 Centrifugal Pumps
Centrifugal pumps, as illustrated by the small experimental liquid helium pump [37] in 
Fig. 9-16, are simple devices with one moving assembly (motor shaft, ball bearings, and 
impeller in this case). This pump consists of (1) a stationary, two-piece pump housing, 
which includes a vaneless diffuser for efficient recovery of fluid kinetic energy; (2) a 
rotating, radial flow impeller, which imparts pressure and kinetic energy to the fluid; 
(3) an inducer, which is an axial flow, low-head preimpeller that suppresses cavitation 
in the impeller by boosting the pressure at the impeller inlet; and (4) a drive motor 
and drive shaft and bearings that power the impeller. The motor in this submersible 
pump is immersed in the liquid cryogen, so motor losses are transferred to the cryogen, 
which cools the motor and bearings. Bleed ports in the pump housing control the coolant 
flow. The submersible design offers the possibility of higher rotational speeds because 
the drive shaft is a short, cantilevered extension of the motor shaft. The overall pump

382 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
Figure 9-16 Small centrifugal pump for liquid helium with submersible motor (from Ref [37J).
efficiency of the submersible design tends to be lower because all the motor losses are 
adsorbed at the operating temperature.
Warm drive pumps, illustrated in Figs. 9-17 through 9-19, remove the motor losses
to ambient temperature but have conduction heat leak down the drive shaft and shaft 
housing. The drive shaft must be designed so that it does not operate near its critical speed 
yet has a relatively small heat leak. The pumps illustrated are designed with hermetic 
housings, and thus there are no dynamic seals in the assembly. This arrangement (1) 
eliminates the small but inevitable leakage that escapes through a dynamic seal during 
normal operation, (2) eliminates the possibility of massive leaks that can occur with seal 
failure, and (3) eliminates air leaking into the system during vacuum purging for charging 
of the system with pure gas because it will hold a hard vacuum (which a dynamic seal 
typically will not). This characteristic is especially important with flammable gases or 
liquids.
In contrast to the open impeller design illustrated in Fig. 9-19, Fig. 9-20 illustrates 
a shrouded impeller. Open impellers are easier to fabricate but have slightly lower ef­
ficiencies due to windage losses. The shrouded impeller requires close-fitting seals to 
minimize recirculation losses around the outside of the shroud. Smaller impellers have 
less advantage shrouded because the clearances on axial seals do not scale.
Conventional centrifugal pumps use a fidl emission design, but an unconventional 
partial emission design offers advantages in high-head, low-flow applications. Fig­
ure 9-21 compares impeller and diffuser flow passages for the two designs. The conven­
tional full-emission design uses backward-curved blades on the impeller and a collector 
scroll that allows flow from all impeller channels to pass continually to the pump dis­
charge. The partial emission design uses straight radial blades on the impeller and a

of a fixed displacement pump.
Selecting a particular pump design (impeller type, diameter, and rotational speed) 
involves a trade-off between efficiency, reliability, and long life because pump efficiency 
tends to increase with rotational speed, whereas reliability and long life are more difficult 
to achieve with increased impeller speed. The relationship between impeller speed and 
efficiency is correlated using the concepts of specific speed and specific diameter:

Dynamic similarity of the How occurs at like values of Ns and Ds because Reynolds 
number has only a secondary effect. With gravitational acceleration included in the head 
term (replacing H b> gH), specific speed and diameter are dimensionless, but U.S. 
engineering practice uses dimensional quantities as above.

the best performance; however, al specific speeds below about 30, a partial emission 
pump is more efficient. Thus, at lower specific speeds, partial emission pumps are 
favored and can be used in some applications (/Vs < 20) where positive displacement 
pumps might normally be used. Use of partial emission pumps brings the advantages of 
centrifugal pumps (i.e., generous clearances, no rubbing parts, and low bearing loads).
Until recently pump speeds have usually been limited to 3600 rpm (synchronous 
speed of 60 Hz, 2-pole motors) because of the high cost of high-frequency drives or gear 
boxes. Recent advances in solid-state electronics have made variable frequency drives 
(VFDs) an economic option for pumps, and higher-speed drives are becoming common. 
The advantages of higher rotational speeds are illustrated by Table 9-2, which compares 
the designs of two pumps for the same application-—same head and flow rate but different 
operating speeds.

A comparison of the top two curves (4.2 K, 500 L/h versus 1.8K, 500 L/h) of 
Fig. 9-25 illustrates the effect of the thermodynamic and transport properties of the 
fluid being pumped. The unusual negative NPSH for He I in these tests is attributed both 
to the properties of He I and a sophisticated inducer design. The abrupt decrease in 
head of the 4.2 K curve occurred when the liquid level fell below the pump inlet and the 
pump started ingesting vapor. The actual NPSH for cavitation may be well below the 
— 100 mm shown. Cavitation theory and tests under static conditions are not particularly 
useful in predicting the minimum NPSH for pumps because the pressure reductions from 
theory and static tests (e.g., ultrasonic techniques) may be orders of magnitude greater 
than those observed in flowing cryogens (35,391.

9-2-3 Positive Displacement Pumps
Positive displacement (reciprocating) pumps are used in applications requiring a very 
high pressure (head) rise such as filling high-pressure gas cylinders from a liquid cryogen 
supply. These pumps have also been used to circulate liquid or supercritical helium in 
cooling loops where pressure rises of a few bar are required.
Figure 9-27 is an example of a high-pressure commercial pump that, depending 
on the bore and stroke, delivers from 0.04 L/s at 700 bar to 1.9 L/s at 70 bar. These 
single-action pumps used for filling gas cylinders place the piston rod in compression. 
Consequently, the rod diameter is large to prevent buckling, and the heat leak is high, 
which is unimportant in this application.

Figure 9-29 Pump characteristics for three-cylinder piston pump. Inlet conditions are 4 bar and 4.5 K (from 
Ref (40)).
Fi ure 9-28 shows a three-cylinder piston pump used to circulate supercritical he­
lium [40], As illustrated in Fig. 9-28, the pistons (11) are driven by the upper crank 
mechanism with eccentric disks (1), connecting rods (2) roiling on needle bearings (3), 
and crossheads (5) guided in dry bushings (6). The piston rods (6) lift the pistons so that 
the rods are in tension, thus minimizing their cross section and heat leak. Return springs 
(7) maintain the piston rods in tension and prevent their buckling on the return stroke. 
The fluid is sucked into the space below the piston through a gravity valve (8) on the up 
stroke, and through the inlet valve (9) on the down stroke. The fluid leaves the pump 
through the exit valve (10). The piston has two guide rings and five sealing rings, all 
made with wear resistant Teflon compound.
Figure 9-29 shows the performance of this pump; its characteristic curves are nearly 
vertical. This behavior is in sharp contrast to that of centrifugal pumps, which have more 
horizontal characteristic curves over much of their flow range. The isentropic efficiency 
of the pump varies from 67% at the highest flow rate and head rise, to 22% at the lowest 
flow rate and head rise.
9-3 COLD COMPRESSORS
9-3-1 Introduction
Cold compressors are frequently used to boost the pressure of the low-pressure return 
stream in helium refrigerators operating at temperatures below about 4.4 K. Cold cqm- 
pressors offer the following advantages 141 J: (1) reducing the volume of the low-pressure

394 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
Figure 9-30 Range of application of different types of cold compressors; (a) ejector, (b) piston compressor,

stage below 1 2 bar (f) no cold compressor (from Ref [41])
side of the heat exchangers by reducing the volumetric flow rate; (2) eliminating subat- 
mospheric piping outside the refrigerator cold box, thus reducing the possibility of air 
leaking into the helium refrigerant; and (3) improving the thermodynamic efficiency of 
the refrigeration cycle in some cases.
The effect of cold compressors on refrigerator efficiency is complex, but in general 
they can reduce losses associated with nonideal gas properties at the coldest temperatures. 
Because the specific heat of the low-pressure return stream is greater than that of the 
high-pressure stream at the lowest temperature part of a helium refrigerator, there is 
excess refrigeration in the low-pressure stream that cannot normally be used (41], A 
cold compressor takes advantage of this surplus refrigeration. Ejectors use some of the 
available work (exergy) normally lost in a J-T expansion to compress the low-pressure 
stream.
Types of cold compressors include ejectors (jet pumps), piston compressors, and 
turbocompressors (both single and multistage). Figure 9-30 shows the approximate range 
of applicability of each type of compressor, as given by Quack [41 ]. With reference to 
the ranges of application delineated in the figure, the following comments are notewor­
thy:
A. The ejector is a simple device without moving parts. Its poor thermodynamic effi­
ciency limits its use to lower capacities.
B. Piston compressors can be used for small volumetric throughputs. The lower the 
dead volume, the lower the attainable temperature.
Ranges C, D, and E are for cold turbocompressors.
C. Here the exhaust pressure of 1.2 bar can be reached in one stage of compression.
D. Here the final exhaust pressure of 1.2 bar requires several stages of compression.

CRYOGENIC EQUIPMENT 395
E. Some pressure increase can be obtained from one or several stages of turbo compres­
sion, but it is not practical to try to reach 1.2 bar by cold compression.
F. There remains quite a large field where no technical solution for cold compression is
now feasible. The volumetric flow rate is too large for a piston compressor and too 
small for a turbo compressor The only technical solution available today is warming 
the gas up to room temperature and compressing it with room-temperature vacuum
pumps.
9-3-2 Turbo Compressors
Several combinations of drive type (gas turbine, oil turbine, and electric motor) and 
bearing type (gas, oil, and magnetic) are used in cold turbo compressors, as illustrated 
in Figs. 9-31 through 9-34.
A matrix of bearing and drive combinations feasible for cold compressors appears 
in Table 9-3. Leakage of oil or warm bearing gas into the process stream is a major 
consideration in the matrix. For exhaust pressures greater than 1.2 bar, a number of drive 
and bearing combinations are feasible. For exhaust pressures below 1.2 bar, electric 
motor drive with magnetic bearings or ball bearings are in operation along with gas 
turbine drive with gas bearings.
The low density of low-pressure helium requires relatively high-tip-speed compres­
sors to achieve adequate compression ratios. Figure 9-35 shows the effect of compressor

9-3-3 Ejectors
Cold ejectors, introduced in helium refrigerators by Lacaze [45J and Rietdijk [46], are jet
pumps that use available work (exergy) m the high pressure cold stream of a refrigerator 
to reduce the pressure of a subcooler bath, as illustrated in Fl
9-36 Ejectors may be
used alone or with a cold compressor
In an ejector, Fig 9 37 high-pressure supercritical helium at point 1 expands through
a nozzle to form a high velocity low-pressure jet, which entrains the secondary (suction) 
flow that enters the ejector at point 2 The two streams combine in the mixing chamber 
and emerge from the diffuser as a two-phase flow at intermediate pressure, point 3 The 
flow in these simple devices is rather complex Fluid enters the primary nozzle as 
supercritical, low-velocity flow and exits as supersonic and probably metastable liquid

In the mixing zone the primary jet becomes two-phase and decelerates to subsonic flow 
in a shock wave as it mixes with and accelerates the secondary flow For these reasons, 
optimum ejector design is somewhat empirical The performance of a helium ejector 
is illustrated by Fig 9-38 Although the efficiency of ejectors, typically on the order 
of 20%, is lower than that of cold compressors, their simplicity of construction offers 
advantages for small-to-medium-capacity refrigerators.
9-4 CURRENT LEADS
9-4-1 Introduction
Current leads, which conduct electrical current into cryogenic equipment, vary in capac­
ity from milliamperes or less for instrument leads to kiloamperes for large, supercon­
ducting magnets Conduction-cooled current leads, which are simply wires or rods that

span ambient and cryogenic temperatures, are favored for low-capacity leads because 
they are simple to build. Gas-cooled current leads, which are cooled by the counter­
flow of cryogenic gas (usually boil-off gas), are preferred for high-capacity leads below 
liquid nitrogen temperature because they are more efficient. Hybrid leads, which use 
a metallic conductor for their upper stage (300 to about 77 K) and a high-temperature 
superconductor for their lower stage, are under investigation because they offer the 
promise of a several-fold improvement of efficiency compared with gas-cooled leads. 
The goal in the design of current leads is to minimize the heat leak per unit current, Q/Z, 
while maintaining thermal stability.
Figure 9-39 shows how current affects the temperature profile of both conduction
and
as-cooled metallic leads. At the optimum current for a particular lead, (Q/i) min»
the temperature
radient is zero at the ambient temperature end [49-51], Thus, all the
electrical losses in an optimized current lead are conducted to the low-temperature end. 
At greater than optimum currents, a maximum temperature occurs somewhere in the

Intuition might suggest that purer metals with low electrical resistivities would be 
preferred for current leads because they can support higher current densities. This is 
not the case, however, because the thermal conductivity of purer metals is also higher, 
with the result that the optimum (minimum) value of the cold-end heat input (g//)min 
is nearly independent of the material for a variety of pure metals and alloys. The rela­
tionship between the electrical resistivity p and the thermal conductivity k is given by 
the Wiedemann-Franz law

Thus, (2/Z)rmmmuni is fixed for fixed Lq. Experiment shows some variation of Lq 
with material and temperature, as illustrated in Fig. 9-40. Although purer metals have 
a slightly lower average Lo, they should generally be avoided because they have higher 
temperature peaks for a given overload current and a lower heat capacity per unit current 
that leads to faster thermal runaway [52]. Thus, less pure metals offer superior stability 
and near-optimum efficiency. Analytical solutions to the current lead equations also show 
that tapering a lead will not improve its efficiency [50,53).

Insight into the behavior of current leads may be gained by writing the energy 
equation in terms of q*  the heat conducted along the lead per unit current (q — Q/I)

For conductors with constant Lorentz number, Eq. (9-19) can be integrated to give

Thus, the optimum (minimum) value of q^ is independent of both material selection—

the solution of Eq. (9-28) for liquid helium. The heat conducted into the bath is only 
a weak function of the warm-end temperature. For an ideal Wiedemann-Franz metal 
(Lo = 2.45 x 10"8 A2Q2/K2), Eq. (9-28) gives Qq/I ~ 1.08 mW/A for an autonomous 
helium-cooled lead. This value compares well with a numerical solution of 1.13 mW/A 
[54]. For nonideal metals, such as copper, the low-temperature heat leak is a weak 
function of the residual resistivity, as illustrated by Fig. 9-45. The slight reduction in heat 
leak associated with high-purity copper (low p0) is at the expense, however, of a tendency 
towards thermal instability (burnout) [52]. At nondesign currents, high-purity copper is 
less efficient than lower purity materials, such as brass, as illustrated by Fig. 9-46.
The geometry of gas-cooled leads is determined from Eq. (9-21), which applies 
to both types of leads. Because of their lower values of <?(T), gas-cooled leads have a 
more slender aspect ratio than conduction-cooled leads. Figure 9-47 shows {LI/A)opI 
as a function of the residual resistance for helium-cooled copper leads. Table 9-4 gives

Wiedemann-Franz law. Because their thermal conductivity is low and their electrical 
resistivity vanishes, HTSs can be used as the lower stage of hybrid HTS-metal current 
leads, which have significantly lower low temperature losses. Mumford proposed this 
arrangement in 1988 [58]. Figure 9-48 illustrates such a lead. The upper metallic stage 
may be either conduction-cooled or vapor-cooled by helium boil-off gas, nitrogen boil- 
off gas, or gas taken from an intermediate stage of a refrigerator.
In contrast to helium temperature leads for which the low-temperature heat load is
43 times lower for gas-cooled leads than for conduction-cooled leads [53], as cooling
offers only a slight advantage for nitrogen temperature leads, as illustrated by Table 9-5.

The elimination of gas cooling in the upper stage of a hybrid lead results in greater 
flexibility in lead design. The conduction-cooled upper segment can be flexible so that 
lead penetrations into the cryostat need not be aligned with the terminals of the de­
vice being supplied current. Furthermore, because conduction-cooled hybrid leads are 
efficient, cryogen-free systems using cryocoolers are feasible.

The gain in efficiency achieved by HTS hybrid leads depends on the type of HTS 
conductor as well as its configuration. Table 9-5 illustrates, however, that the total electric 
power consumption of hybrid leads tends to be dominated by the losses in the upper 
normal conducting stage. In the best case the overall power consumption is reduced by a 
factor of nearly four. Melt-cast BSCCO leads have superior thermal performance but are 
brittle. For this reason silver-sheathed BSSCO tapes are also under investigation because

loads (from Ref, [59]),

they are more robust. For magnet leads, a parallel path of normal conductor—a safety 
lead—can dump energy from the magnet in case the HTS lead breaks or is driven normal.
Unlike metal leads, tapered HTS leads are more efficient but difficult to fabricate 
from silver-sheathed tapes. Because the electrical loss of an HTS lead is essentially 
zero when it operates below its critical current, it may be possible to exceed the critical 
current and operate in the flux-flow loss regime. However, leads operating in this regime 
may be unstable,
In cryogen-free systems the heat intercept at the junction of the normal conductor 
and the HTS presents a problem because the intercept should have a high thermal con­
ductance and yet be electrically insulated from the cryostat. Several solutions to this 
problem are available:
1. Move the electrical isolation point outside the cryostat. The cryocooler is grounded 
to the lead with a high-conductance metallic connection (copper braid or leaves), and 
the cooler is electrically isolated.
2. Use a thin layer of plastic film, epoxy, or G-iO glass-epoxy, which has low thermal 
conductivity and make the surface area large enough to give an acceptable thermal con­
ductance. The thickness must be great enough to give an adequate breakdown voltage.
3. Clamp a sheet crystalline dielectric, such as sapphire or aluminum nitride, between 
the lead and the cooled surface. At low temperature these crystalline dielectrics have 
thermal conductivities comparable with copper.
4. Use an annular heat pipe in which the central conductor is electrically insulated from 
the outer cooled shell by epoxy dielectric joints, as illustrated in Fig. 9-49. The heat

pipe is filled at ambient temperature with nitrogen gas at about 135 bar so that when 
cooled to operating temperature the annular space is partially filled with liquid nitro­
gen, which evaporates from the inner conductor (removing heat from the lead) and 
condenses on the outer shell that is thermally coupled to the cryocooler.
The development of hybrid leads follows the development of high-current-capacity,
robust HTS conductors. Because of the potential improvement in efficiency offered by 
these leads, they are under consideration for a number of applications.
9-5 HEAT EXCHANGERS
9-5-1 Introduction
Heat exchangers for cryogenic equipment range in size from 25,000 m2 surface area for 
natural gas liquefiers to less than 1 cm2 for microminiature J-T coolers for electronics. 
Regardless of size, the purpose of cryogenic heat exchangers is to conserve refrigeration,
*
 
subject to constraints of size or cost. The effort justified in a heat exchanger design varies 
with the application, of course. In heat exchangers for large LNG or air separation plants, 
small reductions in the heat exchanger irreversibilities may result in substantial savings 
of input power costs over the life of the plant, and thus a detailed, sophisticated analysis 
may be called for. In helium-temperature refrigerators and small coolers, an optimum 
design may be required for the device to work at all. On the other hand, all that may be 
required in a small laboratory heat exchanger may be a back-of-the-envelope calculation 
and a few coils of copper tubing.
The goal of conserving refrigeration may be expressed more precisely as one of 
optimizing the performance of a heat exchanger by minimizing its losses, subject to a 
constraint such as holding the surface area, Mu, or volume constant. These losses are 
measured in terms of the loss in the availability function A (exergy) and are given by
A A ]OsS = ToA5|qss 
(9-30)
where To is the ambient temperature and AS|OS5 is the net entropy generation in the 
heat exchanger. The two major sources of loss in heat exchangers are those due to the
temperature difference between the process streams exchanging heat and those due to
friction (pressure drop). The entropy
eneration in a heat exchanger section of length
dx is (61,62]
q*  ST m
r2(l + AT/T) + pf
(9-31)
The 1 / T2 dependence of the heat exchanger loss illustrates the importance that efficient 
heat exchangers play in cryogenic processes. The losses for transferring a fixed quantity
of heat at a fixed AT are 5100 times
reater at 4.2 than at 300 K! For a series of
counterflow heat exchangers of fixed size that span some temperature range, Grassman 
and Kopp [61 ] show that the losses are minimized by making AT % T. They also show 
that the heat transfer coefficient should increase as the temperature is lowered.
‘Vaporizers, of course, are an exception.

An essential feature of Eq. (9-31) is that a proposed design change (e.g., making 
the passage longer or more narrow) induces changes in the opposite direction in the two 
terms of the expression. Thus, there exists an optimum design for which the overall 
irreversibilities are a minimum, as illustrated by Fig. 9-50, in which the irreversibility 
distribution $ is defined as
(9-32)

■■■■
heat transfer irreversibility
For this example, 0op[ = 0.17, so the optimum does not occur when the two irreversibil­
ity mechanisms are perfectly balanced, although setting 0 = 1 is a fair (back-of-the- 
envelope) way of guessing the optimum. In heat exchanger design it should be recognized 
that there is a limit to the advantage gained by increasing the heat exchanger size.
Some characteristics common to many cryogenic heat exchangers are
1. Compact size (high heat transfer area to volume ratio) so as to reduce their outside 
surface area and hence the heat leak.
2. High surface area per unit mass flow and a high heat transfer coefficient so as to 
achieve high effectiveness and low losses.

CRYOGENIC EQUIPMENT 415
3. Low pressure drop so as to keep frictional irreversibilities in balance.
4. High pressure in some cases (for some processes such as J-T refrigerators, the high- 
pressure channels may see pressures of 200 bar or more).
5. Operation in regions with nonideal fluid properties in some cases.
6. Operation in a high-vacuum insulation space in some cases (in which case the outer 
shell must typically be leaktight to better than 10“8 or I0“9 std cm3/s helium leak 
rate).
9-5-2 Types of Heat Exchangers
Heat exchangers may be classified according to designation as recuperative or regener­
ative, flow arrangement, or according to type of construction.
Recuperative heat exchangers. Flow arrangements typical of recuperative heat ex­
changers and their accompanying temperature profiles are illustrated in Fig. 9-51. The 
counterflow arrangement is the workhorse of cryogenic heat exchangers because it has

the lowest losses. For balanced flow, (zncp)h = (wcp)c, the temperature difference, and 
hence the temperature difference portion of the loss, approaches zero as the area of a 
counterflow heat exchanger increases (the parallel-flow arrangement is seldom used in 
cryogenic heat exchangers because of its inherently high losses).
Construction types of simple cryogenic counterflow heat exchangers are illustrated 
in Figs. 9-52 and 9-53. Two of the simplest arrangements are a pair of copper tubes 
soldered together and wound in a coil for compactness and a coil of copper tubing 
in an annular space—typically with boil-off gas in the annulus in counterflow with a 
pressurized stream in the tube. Commercial internally finned tubing can be incorporated 
in some of these simple configurations to improve the surface area and heat transfer 
coefficient.
Some more complex configurations used when size, economics, or process require 
large size or a low-loss heat exchanger are coiled tubular (Hampson), plate-fin, and 
perforated plate. Figure 9-54 illustrates a large tubular-type heat exchanger. It has 
several tube-sidestreams. The tubes are coiled around the core ina number of layersand 
collected at both ends of the exchanger in headers. The core cylinder gives mechanical 
stability, and its minimum diameter is determined by the maximum curvature of the 
tube for which no flattening occurs. Successive layers of tubes are wound in opposite 
directions and separated by spacing strips to give uniform crossflow on the shell side.
Figure 9-55 illustrates a brazed aluminum plate-fin heat exchanger. This type heat ex­
changer is quite flexible in its flow configuration with up to 11 streams and 4 
refrigeration temperature levels designed into a single shell. It is compact (up to 450 ft2

Although plastic separators between flow passages appear in the figure, more recent 
practice uses stainless steel spacers with diffusion bonding [68] or vacuum brazing [69] 
to prevent leaks between channels and through the outer shell The leakage problem 
previously hindered the development of this class of heat exchanger Sixsmith et al [70] 
developed a similar heat exchanger with slots, that gives about a 40% higher heat transfer 
coefficient than circular holes
The reversing heat exchanger scheme of Fig 9-57 [71 ] is frequently used to remove 
carbon dioxide and water from the feed stream of cryogenic air separation plants The 
flow in channels A and B periodically reverses so that impurities frozen out in A (while 
the raw airstream flows into A) are swept out by clean gas after the flow is reversed
Proper operation of reversing heal exchangers requires careful attention both to the 
phase equilibria of the frozen contaminants and to the temperature distribution in the 
heat exchanger Reversing heat exchangers are usually oriented with the cold end up so 
that flow of melted contaminants is towards the warm end
Regenerators are quite simple devices that exhibit veiy complex behavior A regen­
erator with counterflow —the arrangement used in cryogenic applications—is illustrated 
in Fig 9 58 As with the reversing heat exchangers described above, the regenerator is 
a periodic flow device In the first part of the cycle flow at some temperature 7b enters 
the regenerator matrix from the left As the gas (or fluid) flows through the regenerator,

cools some. In the second part of the cycle, gas flows into the regenerator from the right 
at some temperature Tt and is cooled as it progresses towards the low-temperature end 
of the regenerator. The matrix warms back to its original condition.
In the limit of infinite regenerator heat capacity (no temperature swin

trix), the counterflow regenerator behaves just like a counterflow heat exchanger. Real

15 K (where the volumetric heat capacity of the matrix is reduced to the same order 
of magnitude as that of the gas) see significant swings in the matrix temperature, as 
illustrated by Fig. 9-59.
A regenerator’s effectiveness is based on the mass average of the gas exit temper­
ature, which varies with time, as illustrated by Fig. 9-60. Not only is the effectiveness 
a function of regenerator size (Mu) and the ratio of fluid heat capacities (Cmin/Cmax), 
it also depends on the ratio of the heat capacity of the regenerator matrix to the heat

9-5-3 Heat Exchanger Design
*
* Design of He II heat exchangers is covered in chapter 10 of (his handbook.
The first law of thermodynamics applied to a steady-flow heat exchanger with two 
channels gives
(9-33)
(9-35)
dHh = (AsU/mh)(Th-Tc)d^ 
for the enthalpy change of the warm stream, and
dHc = ±(mh/mc)dHh 
(9-34)
for the enthalpy change of the cold stream, where the plus sign refers to counterflow and 
the minus sign to parallel flow. In Eq. (9-33)
d*=dA
s/As 
and U is a function of temperature and pressure.
Depending on the thermodynamic region of the gases (or fluids) in the heat ex­
changer, Th and Tc may be simple or complex functions of and 7/c, and further 
simplification of the preceding equations may or may not be appropriate. If the heat 
exchanger operates in the near-critical region, where the specific heat is a strong function 
of both temperature and pressure (see Fig. 1-9), numerical integration of Eqs. (9-33) and 
(9-34) using a thermodynamic property code gives the most accurate and informative 
result. The integration may be obtained with finite difference or element techniques, 
or the problem may be treated as an initial value or propagation problem with initial 
values at one end of the heat exchanger (e.g., and Tc2) used to march through the 
heat exchanger to obtain values at the other end (7hz and Tcl). Because the inlet stream 
conditions at opposite ends of the heat exchanger (7hi and Tci) are usually the knowns, 
iteration of the solution is required until the assumed value of Tc2 gives the correct inlet 
condition Tc\. In regions where there is a particularly strong dependence of pressure, it 
is necessary to solve the pressure drop equations simultaneously with Eqs. (9-33) and 
(9-34). Figure 9-61, which gives the temperature distribution of a helium counterflow 
heat exchanger operating in the near-critical region, shows the effect that nonuniform 
heat capacity may have on the stream-to-stream temperature difference. In such cases 
the temperature difference in the middle of the heal exchanger is considerably larger 
than that at either end. In some cases the opposite situation may arise with a temperature 
pinch occurring in the middle of the exchanger. In these cases a heat exchanger design 
would be faulty if based on the log mean temperature difference at the ends.
If a heat exchanger design requires only modest accuracy, using average properties, 
even in the near-critical region, gives results with accuracies on order of 15% or better 
in the ineffectiveness (74]. In the noncritical region, harmonic averaging of the specific 
heat gives values of effective 2Vtu within a few percent for balanced flow, with larger 
errors for unbalanced flow [751.

Two other sources of irreversibility that limit the performance of high-design Mu 
cryogenic heat exchangers are heat leak from the environment and flow maldistribution. 
Precise evaluation of these effects requires detailed computer models of the particular 
heat exchanger. Chowdhury and Sarangi [80] derived an analytical solution for the ef­
fects of heat leak on a simple, coaxial, counterflow heat exchanger. For the case of a

between ambient and liquid air temperatures, they
developed a chart, Fig. 9-66, which relates the effective Mu to the design Mu as afunction 
of v — Cmin/Cmax, and a heat leak parameter a — U0Aq/UiA (the ratio of the shell-to- 
ambient thermal conductance to the thermal conductance between streams). For a typical 
value of a = 10"4 for cryogenic air plant heat exchangers, Fig. 9-66 shows that the effec­
tive Mu has a limiting value of 100—regardless of the design Mu of the heat exchanger.
Increasin
this heat exchanger size much above Mu design causes little reduction in the
heat transfer irreversibility, while increasing the pressure drop irreversibility.
Flow maldistribution in multiparallel-passage heat exchangers degrades their per­
formance because the gain in effectiveness in the low-flow channels is less than the loss 
of effectiveness in the high-flow channels. This phenomenon arises from the 1/(1+ Mu) 
dependence of the ineffectiveness. Because the effects of flow maldistribution become 
more severe as the design Mu increases, they are a major concern in the design of 
cryogenic heat exchangers. The lower susceptibility of coiled-tubular heat exchang­
ers to flow maldistribution effects has been a factor encouraging their use in base-load
LNG plants. Fleming [81J analyzed flow maldistribution effects for several flow passage 
arrangements, and Weimer and Hertzog [82] used detailed computer models to analyze 
effects in plate-fin and coiled tubular heat exchangers. Some conclusions from their 
studies are

1. If the flow distribution is nonuniform, little is gained by increasing the design 
rather, the distribution should be improved by careful attention to header design and
channel uniformity.
2 The effect of flow maldistribution can be reduced either by mixing the uniform side
flow throughout the exchanger or by adding headers to the exchanger and mixin
the
flow from both streams at intervals along its length.
3. Because of the complexity of exchangers in cryogenic service, it is difficult quan­
titatively to generalize the effects of maldistribution with simple models. Detailed 
computer simulation is recommended.

term becomes significant and should be included in an accurate analysis. Hausen [83] 
first solved the regenerator equations with periodic flow. A review of techniques for 
solving these equations is given in Ref. [84].

As previously noted, when the heat load on the regenerator matrix is zero (Cr/Cmjn = oo), 
the effectiveness of both the counterflow regenerator and counterflow heat exchanger 
is identical. The effect of void volume heat capacity on regenerator performance is 
illustrated in Fig. 9-69 for a regenerator with Mu.o = 50 (A = 100) [73]. The lower 
curve (fi — oo) is for the case of negligible void volume heat capacity. The behavior of 
regenerators with significant void volume heat capacity can be counterintuitive. In some 
regenerators with low matrix heat capacity, increases in matrix heat capacity may reduce 
the effectiveness rather than increase it.
9-5-5 Heat Transfer Coefficients and Pressure Drop
The multitude of heat transfer surfaces available is testament to the ingenuity of heat 
exchanger designers. We
ive heat transfer correlations for a few of the simpler config­
urations and refer the reader to the references—especially Compact Heat Exchangers 
by Kays and London [77]—fora more comprehensive treatment. The uncertainty in the 
correlations is typically on the order of 10 to 20%.

for 2300 < Re < 107 and 0.5 < Pr < 120. The fluid properties are evaluated at the 
bulk temperature, as indicated by the subscript b.
For short tubes (L/d < 60), modify the heat transfer by
hm/hao= l + (d/L)07 
(9-58)
where hm is the mean transfer over the length, and is given by Eq. (9-57). Equa­
tion (9-58) illustrates the improvement in heat transfer given by perforated plate heat 
exchangers, which operate in the entrance region regime with d/L values near one.
In helical cods the heat transfer coefficient is enhanced by an induced secondary 
flow. For fully developed turbulent flow the enhancement is
hc/h = 1 +3.5d/Dh 
(9-59)
For annular or rectangular passages, replace the tube inside diameter d in
Eq. (9-57) with the equivalent diameter De given by Eq. (9-2). For an annulus, Dc
is Do — DH the difference between the outside and inside diameter.

CHAPTER

He II (SUPERFLUID HELIUM)

10-1 INTRODUCTION
Superfluid helium (or He II) has special properties that are generally different from 
those of al! other common cryogenic fluids. For this reason, this handbook devotes a 
complete chapter to the subject. The purpose of this chapter is to survey the subject of 
He II properties and applications so that engineers and scientists can use the information 
for analysis of data and system design. Emphasis is on the engineering aspects of 
the fluid with occasional, where necessary, reference to fundamentals. Much of this 
chapter has been abstracted and updated from Helium Cryogenics [1], which was written 
by the author about 15 years ago. Readers may find that reference particularly useful 
for understanding the origin of the physical principles behind the equations. For more 
in-depth development of the physical properties, the reader is referred to one of several 
reference texts on liquid helium [2—4).
The interest in applications of He II has grown in recent years so that now there 
exist a considerable number of large-scale systems that utilize this unique fluid as a 
coolant. Included among these are cryogenic systems for large-scale superconducting 
magnets, electron accelerators, and a range of space-based applications. Over the years, 
these applications have encouraged a database development for He II that can be used 
for design. This chapter on He II represents an attempt to bring the He II database into 
one location to simplify its use by scientists and engineers. To this end, the chapter is 
organized as follows. We begin with a survey of the unique properties of He II, including 
the transport equations. The next section describes the heat and mass transfer issues 
unique to He II Finally, we discuss, by example, the application of He II in technical 
devices.

The data and correlations given in this chapter all use SI units unless otherwise 
specified. Graphical representations of He II properties are given in the text, and more 
detailed tabular values are listed in the appendix. Most of the data presented were obtained 
from the property database software, HEPAK [5]. Other values are available in tabular 
form in the literature [6J.
10-2 PROPERTIES OF He II
10-2-1 Phase Diagram
The phase diagram of liquid helium clearly shows the unique characteristics of this 
fluid (see Fig. 10-1). In addition to the standard features such as the critical point and 
liquid-vapor coexistance line, one can see that the liquid can exist in either of two very 
different states. He I is the normal liquid with characteristics that are typical of classical 
fluids, whereas the superfluid state, which is more correctly referred to as He II, has 
physical features that are truly exceptional. Most notable of these features are the trans­
port properties, with a vanishingly small viscosity and an apparent thermal conductivity 
many orders of magnitude larger than liquids or even high-conductivity solids. The X 
line separates these two liquid states. This designation was adopted because the specific 
heat near the transition has the shape of the Greek letter A. The X transition temperature

until it intersects the solid coexistence boundary at 1.763 K, p = 2.974 MPa.
The phase diagram of helium is also unique in that it lacksa triple point of coexistence
between liquid, vapor, and solid because the solid state can exist only under an external 
pressure. The intersection of the k line with the two phase coexistence regions of liquid 
and vapor or solid and liquid is not a triple point, although it occasionally is identified 
incorrectly as such. The A. transition represents a second-order phase transition, and there 
is no latent heat of formation of the He II state. The coexistence of He II and He I in 
equilibrium conditions is not possible. The actual values of the pressure, temperature, 
and density of liquid helium at the A. transition are listed in Table 10-1.
10-2-2 State Properties
The properties of He II at saturated vapor pressure are given in Table 10-2. The saturation 
density p is one of the most important thermodynamic properties of liquid helium because 
it is needed to derive the equation of state. Plotted in Fig. 10-2 is the saturated density

The bulk isothermal compressibility is plotted in Fig. 10-4. Typical values for k are 
about 1.2 x 10“7 Pa“* below 1 K, increasing to 2 x 10~7 Pa-1 at 3K. Note that the 
compressibility has a discontinuity at the A point, which is consistent with the signature 
of a second-order phase transition.
The specific heat of saturated liquid helium is shown in Fig. 10-5. At very low temp­
eratures, T < 0.6 K, the specific heat appears to obey a cubic dependence,
C = 20.4T3 
(10-4)
in SI units (J/kg- K). Although in this case C refers to the specific heat at saturated 
vapor pressure, at low temperatures the differences between C, Cp and Cv are small. The

cubic dependence comes from the primary excitations in this regime being longitudinal 
phonons.
At higher temperatures, the temperature exponent of the specific heat increases by 
about a factor of 2. Historically, the region has been divided into two segments where 
the temperature dependence goes as
C = 108T67 for 0.6 < T < 1.1 K
(10-5)
and
56
for 1.1 < T < Tk
(10-6)
in SI units (J/kg - K). In this regime, the higher exponent to the temperature dependence 
comes from roton excitations that begin to dominate the spectrum as 7\ is approached.
The entropy in this regime displays the same temperature dependence as the specific
heat because S is related to C through the integral S — f ~ dT. Figure 10-6 displays 
the entropy at saturated vapor pressure.
The latent heat of vaporization X of a liquid helium is displayed in Fig.10-7. This 
quantity is only defined along the saturated vapor pressure curve by the Clausius- 
Clapeyron equation
(10-7)
where ug and l>i are the specific volumes of the gas and liquid, respectively. The heat of 
vaporization represents the energy required to take a unit of helium from the liquid to 
the vapor state It is, therefore, an indirect measure of the strength of the intermolecular 
bonds associated with the formation of the liquid slate.
The surface tension ct has units of J/m2 and is associated with the energy increase 
due to the free-liquid surface. A polynomial fit to a in the He II regime follows the form

10-2-3 Transport Properties
The behavior of He II when subjected to a mass or heal flow clearly demonstrates the 
unique character of this fluid. The observed effects cannot, in general, be treated by 
classical fluid mechanics models. The most accepted approach to understanding the 
transport properties is by means of the two-fluid model. This model treats He II as a 
mixture of two interpenetrating fluids: the normal fluid component and the superfluid 
component. The normal fluid component contains the excitations and therefore carries 
entropy and heat. It has a density pn, velocity vn, and viscosity, The superfluid 
component is in the condensed state and carries no entropy. The superfluid density is

designated by ps and velocity by vs and it has zero viscosity. The two-fluid model explains 
many of the unique transport properties of the He II phase. In the following sections, the 
results of the two-fluid model are stated in the form of correlations for He II properties. 
The important thing to keep in mind is that these results are based on a phenomenological 
theory combined with experimental data.
The normal fluid density obeys the relationship
Pn 
P
(10-9)
and pn+Ps = P- This relationship is consistant with the temperature dependence of the 
specific heat and entropy. The normal fluid viscosity is a quantity determined through 
heat transport or flow measurements. Figure 10-9 displays the temperature dependence 
of r?n numerical values are listed in Table 10-3.

ations in the fluid. The differential equation used to describe sound propagation has the

c 2
(10-12)
Second sound has been measured extensively from 71 to near absolute zero and as a 
function of pressure [7]. Values for c2 are compared to ci in Fig. 10-10. Note that c2 is 
approximately constant over the range 1-2 K. At lower temperatures the second sound 
velocity increases rapidly as the temperature approaches absolute zero.
Laminar flow and the critical velocity. Laminar flow conditions occur in He II when­
ever the fluid velocity is below the critical velocity. These conditions can occur even in 
static He II because heat transport causes a relative velocity of the two fluid components. 
In He II there are two relevant critical velocities: «sc, which is associated with the onset 
of turbulence in the superfluid component, and wnc for the normal fluid component. The 
velocity ux depends strongly on the method by which it is measured. Most experimental
data are correlated to the empirical relationship
wsc

(10-13)
On the other hand, the normal fluid critical velocity is interpreted in terms of classical 
turbulent onset such that

where the critical Reynolds number is Rec ~ 1200. Note that this relationship involves 
the normal fluid viscosity but the total density.
Laminar heat flow. Heat flow in He II is carried by the normal fluid component in a 
process known as internal convection or counterflow. In laminar flow, which occurs for

although the function of proportionality varies as the square of the diameter. The laminar 
flow heat conductivity function g(T) increases strongly with temperature dominated by 
the dependence of (ps)2T % T12. Figure 10-11 displays g(T) between 1.2Kand 7\. 
Table 10-3 gives numerical values for this coefficient at saturated vapor pressure.
Laminar mass flow. In the laminar flow regime, owing to the isentropic nature of the 
system, the pressure drop due to flow is related to the temperature gradient through 
London’s equation as follows:
dp 
dT
  — DS---- 
dx-------dx
(10-16)
The fountain effect, a unique feature of He II, can be understood in terms of this expres­
sion. Specifically, in ideal superflow, a temperature gradient induces a pressure gradient, 
which in practice can lead to net mass flow of the fluid.
In the laminar flow regime, the heat-flow-induced pressure gradient is related to the 
temperature gradient through London’s equation. The result is given by

where ft is the same geometrical factor as in Eq, (10-15). This relationship can easily 
be integrated over finite lengths and temperature difference to give practical results.
Turbulent flow. Above the critical velocity wsc, other dissipative processes begin to 
play a significant role. In particular the turbulent state, consisting of quantized vortex 
lines intermixed with the normal fluid component, destroys the isentropic nature of the 
superfluid state. In this regime, additional dissipative processes come into play, and the 
appropriate heat conductivity equation is modified as follows:

In relatively large-scale engineering design calculations (e.g., d > 1 mm), the tur­
bulent term in the heat conductivity equation dominates, allowing one to use the following
simplified expression for design calculations:

This expression may be used much as Fourier's law for determining heat conduction in 
Hell.

Transient heat transfer. Transient heat transfer problems in static He II can be treated 
with a nonlinear heat diffusion equation. The one-dimensional form of this equation is
(10-22)
where qCM is any externally applied heat source. This expression has a very similar 
appearance to the ordinary diffusion equation with the one exception that it involves 
the cube root of the temperature gradient. On the basis of Eq. (10-22) one can define a 
characteristic diffusion time Td given by
rd = apCf'/3&.T2/3L4/3 = L.4/3/D^ 
(10-23)
where the coefficient a is a constant of order unity and DCff is the effective diffusivity of 
He II. Note that, unlike ordinary diffusion, rd varies as the 4/3 power of the characteristic 
length.
The He II diffusion equation has been successfully compared with experiment for a 
variety of conditions such as localized pulsed source [8] and step-function clamped flux 
[9,10]. For example, when one considers step function clamped flux problem, where 
heat is applied at one end of a channel of length L, there are primarily three boundary 
conditions at x = L\
• Isothermal at x == L\T{L,t} —
• Adiabatic at .v — L:dT/dt(L) — 0
• Infinite channel: T(oo, t) —
For a given heat flux q there exists a time Ar
*
 during which heat can be effectively trans­
ferred before boiling sets in. This condition is the transient equivalent of Eq. (10-21), 
which eventually will produce the steady-state solution for isothermal boundary con­
ditions. Figure 10-14 displays the. Ar
*  versus q for different length channels and 
boundary conditions assuming constant properties at 1.8K. Note that for an infinite 
channel, Ar

Forced-flow heat transfer. Forced-flow heat transfer to He II may similarly be analyzed 
using the appropriate nonlinear heat equation
+ q<M
(10-24)
where the additional term is introduced to account for ordinary convection processes. 
Because of the nonlinear and temperature dependent properties, Eq. (10-24) can only 
be solved using numerical techniques. Solutions require fixed boundary conditions and 
have been successfully compared with experiments involving local or distributed heat 
sources [12,13].
In steady state, the simplified one-dimensional heat equation can be solved either 
by approximate analytic methods for constant properties or more accurately throu 
numerical methods. This problem has been solved for numerous cases including local 
[14,15] and distributed heat sources [16] as well as heat transfer boundary conditions as 
occur in heat exchangers [ 17-19].

Pressure drop in turbulent flow. The pressure drop associated with flow of turbulent 
He II has been analyzed for a variety of channel geometries [20-22). The most notable 
feature of these measurements is the similarity of friction factor to that for classical 
fluids. In other words, the pressure drop may be correlated with the expression
Ap = 2fdpu2
(10-25)
where the friction factor fa is similar to that observed for classical fluids. For example, 
smooth-tube friction factors for He II in the Reynolds number regime Red > 2 x 104 
appear to follow the von Kdrm^n-Nikuradse correlation
= 1.737 In (/?ed/dI/2) - 0.396
(10-26)
where the Reynolds number is defined by Keypad/qn. Similarly for 15

is preferred.
For noncircular cross-section channels, present evidence suggests that the friction 
factor may also be correlated by classical models.
The preceding discussion for the most part assumes that the helium flow is fully 
developed and turbulent. This allows both the use of the turbulent pressure drop corre­
lations and the turbulent heat transport relation. More complex phenomena can occur, 

460 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
particularly in flow systems consisting of narrow channels in laminar flow, which can lead 
to fountain-effect-driven flows. For such complex behavior, a more complete modeling 
approach is necessary (see, for example, Ref. [23]).
10-2-4 Surface Heat Transfer
A unique characteristic of heat transfer in He II is the process that occurs at an interface
between a solid and the liquid. In contrast to ordinary convection heat transfer, surface 
heat transfer in He II is more controlled by the nature of the interface, including the 
properties of the solid material, rather than the condition of the bulk liquid. At relatively
low heat flux, there is no boilin
at the surface, and the heat transfer is dominated by a
phenomenon known as Kapitza conductance. For heat fluxes greater than the peak value 
q*  the surface is blanketed by a film of He I or vapor or both. In this region the heat 
transfer is controlled primarily by the character of this film.
Kapitza conductance. Thermal boundary conductance occurring at the interface be­
tween a solid and liquid He II is of great technical interest because it often results in the 
largest temperature differences in a He II heat transfer problem. Although there have 
been many theories [24] on the subject, Kapitza conductance is usually defined in terms 
of empirical data. Ideally, the Kapitza conductance is defined in the limit where q and 
ATS are vanishingly small as
^Ko — limA7;—o
(10-28)
where ATS is (Ts — Tb) and the subscript 0 refers to the limit as ATS 0. In the limit 
of small AT, may be described by a fairly simple relationship
hK ~ aTn
(10-29)
where n is between 2 and 4 and a is an empirically determined quantity. Listed in
Table 10-6 are the highest values obtained experimentally for a variety of metals and 
nonmetals [25]. These values appear to correlate with the Debye temperature , which 
is characteristic of the material. However, it is important to note that these experimental 
values vary considerably—in some cases by as much as an order of magnitude.
Experimental measurements have shown that the magnitude of h k at a given temper­
ature varies by as much as an order of magnitude among samples. Part of this variation 
can be attributed to surface condition; oxidation, impurities, or condensates. Generally, 
the high values in Table 10-6 are for surfaces that are cleaned carefully either chemically 
or mechanically and perhaps recrystallized at room temperature to reduce surface strain.
Practical materials will have lower Kapitza conductance coefficients. For copper, ap­
proximate empirical forms for the Kapitza conductance in this temperature range have
been suggested:
h k 900T3 for clean surfaces
Ak ~ 400T3 for dirty surfaces

in W/m2 • K. Most observed values fall in this range. In comparing Eqs. (10-30) and 
(10-31) with the values in Table 10-6, it is fair to assume that technical surfaces will 
have Kapitza conductances in the range of 30 to 50% of the highest experimental val­
ues. However, great care should be exercised when applying these correlations without 
experimental confirmation.
For large heat fluxes, q > 1 kW/m2, the Kapitza conductance can no longer be 
adequately described by the linear coefficient, Eqs. (10-28) and (10-29). Rather, on the 
basis of experimental data and theory, a more general form for the surface heat flux is 
usually written as
7=a(Tsm-Tbm) 
(10-32)
where a and m are also adjustable parameters. Note that if one equation is able to 
fit the experimental data for one sample over the whole temperature difference range, 
then it should be possible to expand Eq. (10-32) to obtain the low-heat-flux temperature 
dependence. Similar to the behavior of the experimental data for small AT, the high- 
heat-flux Kapitza conductance values also vary considerably with sample preparation. 
Figure 10-15 shows the measured surface temperatures for different materials in this 
heat flux regime. Also, listed in Table 10-7 is a summary of the fit coefficients in 
Eq. (10-32) for the data displayed in Fig. 10-15. Displayed are the surface preparation, 
surface temperature at a heat flux q = 1 W/cm2, and the best-fit functional form to these 
data. Note that most of the fits give values of in ~ 3 ± 0.5. Also, the best fit to the 
coefficient in Eq. (10-31) is for a % 0.5 kW/m2 • Kw+1, but with substantial variation. It 
is interesting to note that the variation in Kapitza conductances at large AT is not nearly 
as great as is obtained in the limit ATs —► 0, where an order-of-magnitude deviation in 
/ik is seen.

Finally, there is considerable experimental evidence to show that the Kapitza con­
ductance is not a function of fluid velocity [26,27]. This feature comes about because 
of the microscopic nature of the heat exchange in Kapitza conductance. As a result, 
technical application of published data can be accomplished without concern for the 
flow conditions of the helium, provided the fluid temperature does not exceed

Film-boiling heat transfer. The film-boiling regime of heat transfer is of significant 
technical importance, for its occurrence can lead to catastrophic events in cryogenic 
systems where good heat transfer must be maintained continuously. Unfortunately, boil­
ing heat transfer in He II is the least understood process and is subject to engineering 
correlation rather than model calculation.
In He II above the peak heat fl ux, the fluid at the heat transfer surface exists in several 
different phases. Consequently, the physical interpretation of the heat transfer processes 
is more difficult than in single-phase He II. For heat fluxes above q*  there occurs a 
discontinuous jump in the surface temperature. This transition marks the formation of 
a stable film of helium vapor, liquid He I, or both, blanketing the heat-transfer surface 
Theoretical efforts to model this process have met with some success, and the most 
commonly analyzed problem consists of a stable film boiling in saturated He II [28,29]. 
For design purposes, the best approach remains that of empirically determining the best 
values for the film-boiling heat transfer coefficient. Listed in Table 10-8 are published 
values for this coefficient. Note both the strong geometrical and pressure dependence to 
this process.
10-3 TECHNOLOGY OF He II APPLICATIONS
This section summarizes the status of He II technology for applications. Emphasis is 
on major technical areas that have unique characteristics as compared with the classical 
technology. The principal areas discussed include refrigeration techniques, heat exchang­
ers, pumping methods, and flow metering.
10-3-1 Refrigeration Techniques
J-T refrigeration cycles. The most direct method of obtain! n He II is by reducing the
vapor pressure over the saturated liquid to a pressure below (p < 50 kPa). This state 
can be relatively easily obtained by attaching a high-capacity vacuum pump to a closed

volume of liquid helium. One disadvantage of such an approach is that it is relatively in­
efficient and can not provide conti nuous refrigeration owing to the finite volume of 1 iquid. 
Most practical He 11 refrigeration systems exist as an addendum to a normal he­
lium closed-cycle refrigerator. Thus, the normal starting point for a low-temperature 
(T < 4.2 K) refrigeration circuit is from an isothermal bath of He 1. A schematic of an
He II refrigeration system that uses this concept is shown in Fig. 10-16. The He II circuit
consists primarily of a counterflow heat exchanger, J-T valve, and a pump or compres­
sor to brin
the low-pressure helium back to suction pressure of the main compressors.
Because the return flow is at low pressure (p % 1 kPa), the counterflow heat exchanger
must be of unconventional design to allow efficient heat transfer at low-pressure drop. An 
alternative approach allows for the recompression of the helium with a cold compressor, 
which improves the heat transfer process on the return side
The importance of the counterflow heat exchanger is made apparent by considering
the T-S diagram for helium, Fig 10-17 Without the counterflow heat exchanger, the
helium will enter the J-T valve at essentially He I reservoir temperature, 4 2 K or above. 
In this case, the isenthalpic expansion is between points (1) and (2) in Fig. 10-17. The 
corresponding maximum yield for this process is

where the subscripts apply to the various locations on the T-S diagram. For this set 
of initial conditions, the maximum yield would be 62% With the counterflow heat 
exchanger, it is possible to reduce the temperature of the incoming fluid to just above
It is difficult to get much lower than 2.2 K because the J-T valve will act as a 
fountain pump, and its performance will be degraded. With a 2.2-K inlet temperature, 
the isenthalpic expansion will be between points (T) and (2') with a corresponding 
maximum yield of 89%.
Once the He II is discharged from the J-T valve, it enters the heat exchanger, which 
absorbs heat from the surroundings. Design of He II heat exchangers is discussed in the 
next section. The mass flow through the circuit depends on the heat load and efficiency 
of the expansion process.
m =-----
yhg
(10-34)
With the latent heat of He II being about 24 kJ/kg, a 20-W heat load corresponds to a 
minimum mass flow rate of about 1 g/s.
For relatively small He II refrigeration systems, the most common approach to 
obtaining the low-pressure stage is to use a vacuum pump with roots blower. These units 
come in various sizes and when combined with an He II heat exchanger can produce 
refrigeration up to about 100 W at 1.8 K (5 g/s at 1.5 kPa) For large He II refrigeration 
systems, cold compressors (30,31] are preferred on the return side, for they increase 
efficiency and reduce the size of the counterflow heat exchanger. These units can provide 
refrigeration in the kilowatt range at 1.8 K. Chapter 9 of this handbook provides further 
information on cryogenic machinery.

10-3-2 Heat Exchangers
He II heat exchangers are indispensable components for superconducting magnets and 
other systems cooled with pressurized He II. However, because of the unusual proper­
ties of He II, specifically the high effective heat conductivity and strong temperature­
dependent heat capacity, conventional heat-exchanger design methods, such as effec­
tiveness or NTU, are not applicable. In this section, we review the current status of He II 
heat exchanger design and analysis.
Several different He II heat exchangers have been designed and developed for ap­
plications [32-34], The most common of these is the static-bath-type system shown 
schematically in Fig. 10-18 The principal component of this system is a saturated He II 
reservoir in thermal contact through its surface to a surrounding pressurized He II reser­
voir. Any heat generated in the pressurized He II reservoir must be transferred through 
the solid wall to the saturated bath, where it is removed by evaporation of the liquid. For 
this type of system, there are two issues of concern. First, the surface area of the heat 
exchanger must be large enough to transfer the heat with minimal AT between the two 
reservoirs. Normally, the surface heat transfer process is controlled by the Kapitza con­
ductance of the heat exchanger material. It is important to make the heat exchanger 
of copper or other high-conductivity material to avoid a significant conduction thermal 
resistance The other issue in the design of these systems involves the heat transport 
in the bulk liquid. In other words, there must be sufficient He II cross section in the 
saturated bath to transport the heat by counterflow with a small temperature gradient.

He II (SUPERFLUID HELIUM) 467
Another common type of He II heat exchanger is the tube-in-shell, which is primarily
used for systems where the pressurized He II is confined to a coolin
loop (Fig. 10-19).
a
An added complexity to the design of this type of heat exchanger occurs when the He II 
loop has a forced flow. In this case, the design requirements are somewhat different. As 
In the saturated bath heat exchanger, tube-in-shell type units must meet the surface area 
requirements for acceptable AT between the two bulk He II reservoirs. Also important is
that the He II cross section within the tube be large enough to transport the heat flux. This

part of the design is complicated by the unusual properties of the bulk He II, particularly 
in forced flow.
Finally, forced-flow He II heat exchangers have also been developed for specialized 
applications [33]. In this case, the two He II reservoirs are contained in closed loops 
with one or both being pumped through the system at a velocity u Fig. (10-20). The 
configuration can be either parallel or counterflow. Design requirements similar to those 
for the tube-in-shell design apply. The surface area must be sufficient, but also the cross
section of the two channels must be large enough to avoid exceedin heat transport limits
in the bulk fluid.
He II heat exchanger energy equations. The beginning point for the numerical analysis 
of an He II heat exchanger is the steady-state He II heat equation with heat transfer

where /(T)-1 is the He II heat conductivity function appropriate for fully developed 
turbulent conditions, AT is the temperature difference between the two He II reservoirs, 
and h is the overall heat transfer coefficient between the two reservoirs Normally, h 
is dominated by the Kapitza conductance coefficient at the two He II solid interfaces. 
The total heat transfer coefficient between two reservoirs of He II when separated by a 
high-conductivity metal wall may be approximated by

where T\ and T2 are fluid temperatures within the hot and cold reservoirs.

to yield

(10-37)
This equation has an analytic solution for constant properties; however, the fully 
temperature-dependent equation must be solved by numerical methods.
For He II heat exchangers, the steady-state onc-dimensional energy equations for the 
parallel and counterflow arc obtained by applying the steady-state He II energy equation 
separately to the two fluid streams coupled by the heat transfer process. The appropriate 
energy equation for each channel may then be written as
where T\ and Tj are fluid temperatures within the hot and cold channels, respectively. 
The third term in each case, ±™(T2 - T\), is the heat transfer flux between channels.
/l
Owing to the high effective thermal conductivity of He II, these heat exchangers 
have exhibited some unusual temperature distributions not seen for the classical fluids, 
such as the minimum temperature observed in the tube-in-shell heat exchanger [35] and 
a crossover of the temperature curves in the parallel-flow heat exchanger [36].
The measured temperatures in both parallel and counterflow He II heat exchangers 
have been correlated with a finite difference numerical model [36]. The numerical model 
used to fit the experimental results has one adjustable parameter, the coefficient /i0, which 
is dominated by the Kapitza conductance between the He II and solid surface. Reasonable 
values for this coefficient can be obtamed by combining Eq. (10-36) with the appropriate 
coefficients given in Table 10-5.
The heat removal capability of an He II heat exchanger is dependent on the mass
flow and bath temperature. With an increase in the mass flow rate, temperature in both 
channels decreases, and more heat can be taken away from the heat source upstream.
This result is consistent with the behavior of classical fluid heat exchangers.
The He II heat transport within the heat exchanger is affected by the mass flow 
rate. At low fluid velocity, the He II internal convection mechanism dominates the
heat transfer process. On the other hand, at high fluid velocity the internal convection 
contribution becomes small, allowing the heat exchanger to be treated in terms of the 
forced convection and heat transfer through the wall. This observation suggests the 
existence of a transition velocity ut. This velocity can be defined by scaling the terms in 
the He II energy equation to obtain
ltl = (pCfU3kT2f3L^r'
(10-40)
where, in this case, AT corresponds to the temperature difference within a iven stream
of He II that is different from the temperature difference between the two separate 
streams. For fluid velocities well below the heat exchanger can be designed with 

470 HANDBOOKOI CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
simplified forms of Eqs. (10-38) and (10-39) that neglect the forced convection terms. 
On the other hand, at velocities much greater than zq, the He II heat exchanger may 
be designed based on the classical heat exchanger methods. The transition velocity is 
rather strong!} temperature-dependent and thus will var\ along the length of the heat 
exchanger. However, taking advantage of these limits may in some cases simplify the 
design analysis.
A satisfactory definition of effectiveness in an He II heat exchanger has yet to be 
developed, and therefore such methods arc not recommended for He II heat exchanger 
design.
10-3-3 Pumping Methods
Circulation of He II through closed systems requires a prime mover or pumping device. 
In the past, there has been some uncertainty about the suitability of classical circulating 
equipment (Le., mechanical pumps) suitable for He II service. This issue has brought 
about some development and testing efforts. In addition, however, He H can be forced 
to flow b} application of the fountain effect, which can circulate He II without the need 
for moving parts.
Mechanical Pumps. There are primarily two classes of mechanical circulation pumps 
that can be used with He II: piston type and centrifugal type. Most of the experience to date 
is with centrifugal-type units 137-39} of modest size. In general, these pumps perform 
with He II in much the same way they do with classical fluids. Pump characteristics, 
such as efficiency and head versus speed performance, show data similar to that expected 
from pump design models. These results allow designers to model performance for 
applications using classical scaling laws. Details of this modeling procedure are not 
presented here, and the reader is referred to the engineering literature [40].
Helium II properties do affect the onset of cavitation in centrifugal pumps, par­
ticularly when pumping saturated He II. The high conductivit} of the He 11 normally 
dissipates the pump heat into the surroundings. As the pump speed increases, the local 
temperature also increases, eventually reaching the saturation condition, which causes 
bulk boiling or the He II-He 1 transition. At this point boiling initiates within the pump. 
If the pump is circulating pressurized He II, the transition is to the He I state, allowing 
flow to continue subject to the limitations of the normal fluid cavitation characteristics. 
In pumping saturated He II, cavitation onset produces large vapor regions in the pump 
head, which severely degrades pump performance [39].
Fountain pumps and phase separators, fountain effect pumps (FEPs) are unique to 
He II. Arp ]41 ] has compared this pumping method to conventional centrifugal pumps for 
He II service. Essentially, this type of pump uses the fountain effect to force He II to flow 
through a porous plug. A heater at the outlet of the pump provides the chemical potential 
difference to drixe the fluid. Such a device has been developed and demonstrated for 
space-based applications |42|, A photograph of the fountain effect pump developed for 
the SHOOT project is shown in Fig. 10-21 [43J. Such a device consists of a sintered 
ceramic disk or plug with a heater located on the downstream side. Typical pore size is 
of the order of 0.1 /zm.

Lines correspond to the ideal fountain pressure.
An ideal fountain pump obeys the London equation and produces a pressure head 
corresponding to the temperature difference generated by a heater downstream of the 
flow. If one integrates the London equation, Eq. (10-16), along lines of constant chemical 
potential, the corresponding static pressure head is given in Fig. 10-22. Thus, for an ideal 
fountain pump, the maximum pressure head is about 50 kPa for a bath at 1.8 K. Higher 
pump heads can be realized by running several pumps in series. However, the pump head 
decreases significantly with increasing mass flow rate [44].
For an ideal fountain pump, the corresponding mass flow rate is given by the rela­
tionship
Q = rnSoTo
(10-41)
where the subscript 0 applies to the conditions at the pump outlet. This relationship 
suggests that the pump flow can be increased by simply adding more heat downstream, 
but there are limitations [45]. In an FEP, the addition of heat increases the temperature 
of the helium on the upstream side of the pump. This heat must be extracted by an He II 
refrigeration system to maintain low temperature at the pump inlet. Another important 
limit is the onset of turbulence above the superfluid critical velocity. To avoid this limit 
one should always design a fountain pump to have sufficient area to ensure that the 
velocity does not exceed uc (typically about 10 cm/s for porous media). For a porosity 
of 30%, this velocity corresponds to an approach velocity of about 3 cm/s, a value that 
has been achieved in pump tests [46]. Equation (10-41) can be rearranged in terms of

Q
6.6 &p/p + s\T\
(10-42)
where s, is the entropy at the inlet to the fountain pump and A/? is the hydraulic pressure 
head.
The design of practical FEPs goes beyond the discussion above. To maintain ideal 
flow conditions in the pump, the approach velocity must be maintained below a few 
centimeters per second. Thus, the pump surface area is frequently much larger than the 
pipe cross section in the attached flow circuit. If these conditions are exceeded, pump 
performance will degrade; however, the FEP will continue to pump the helium until 
the inlet temperature exceeds 7\. The advantage of a fountain pump is in its ease of 
application. The pump consists of a heater and porous plug. There are no moving parts. 
On the other hand, the low thermodynamic efficiency of a fountain pump makes it only 
useful in specialized applications [47-50].
Helium II vapor phase separators (VPS) have been developed for containment of 
He II in space applications [51-53]. A VPS consists of a porous plug, frequently made 
from sintered stainless steel powder, that extracts the heat from an He II reservoir by 
allowing evaporation at the surface of the plug. In this application, the characteristic 
pore size is larger than for the FEP because it is necessary to have some flow of the 
normal fluid component to ensure operation. A photograph of a sintered stainless steel 
VPS developed for the IRAS cryogenic system is shown in Fig. 10-23 (54|.
An He II vapor phase separator provides a pressure difference across it
iven by
London’s equation, Eq. (10-16). In use, the upstream side of the phase separator is
wetted with He II while the downstream side is exposed to low-pressure helium vapor.
The phase separator works in the foliowin
way: Heat generated in the He II reservoir
is carried through the porous plug by counterflow to the liquid-vapor interface, which 
preferrably occurs within the body of the plug. The heat is then removed by evaporation 
of the liquid at low pressure. The associated temperature difference across the plug 
provides the fountain pressure to hold the liquid within the Dewar. The total mass flow 
is determined by this rate of heat generation. For purely laminar flow that occurs in an 
ideal phase separator at u < wc, the critical velocity, the mass-flow rate, is given by
pd2 / sT \ Ap 
+ AfgJ L
(10-43)
where p is a shape factor. This relationship appears to fit experimental data for small 
mass-flow rates. If the velocity within the plug exceeds wc, turbulence in the superfluid 
degrades the performance, and the mass flow increases more slowly with Ap.
The design of a porous plug phase separator is dependent on first knowing the mass
flow needed to extract the heat load from the He II reservoir. The pressure drop ac­
ross the plug is determined by the desired operating temperature of that reservoir. The- 
physical dimensions and pore size of the porous plug follow from analysis of Eq. (10-42). 
Most phase separators developed for space applications consist of a sintered stain­
less steel structure [54,551. The typical pore size is between 1 and 10 p.m. Other phase

10-3-4 He II Flowmeterin
Techniques
A wide variety of classical methods to measure either flow velocity or mass-flow rates 
have been developed for He II service In addition, the superfluid properties of He II pro­
vide some new opportunities for flowmetenng Experience with different flowmetenng 
techniques is reviewed below
IXirbine flowmeters. A turbine flowmeter contains a bladed wheel that rotates when 
the liquid moves past it These devices essentially measure volumetric flow because 
the bladed wheel interacts with the fluid in a way that is only weakly dependent on 
fluid density Thus, a turbine flowmeter is similar to a centrifugal pump The rotational 
frequency of the turbine wheel is usually measured with a magnetic pickup and compared 
against a calibration for the given fluid Signal conditioning equipment converts the 
frequency to a voltage output that is nearly linearly related to flow rate
Turbine flowmeters have had good success in classical fluid, including He I except 
at low flow rates, where they lend to show hysteresis [57] Turbines necessarily contain 
moving parts, and thus they are more likely to fail or be susceptible to freezeup from any 
impurity gases in the experimental loop Turbine flowmeters containing jewel (crystal) 
bearings with internal stresses or severe defects fracture from the thermal shock Ceramic 
or metal ball bearings usually survive many thermal cycles between liquid helium and 
room temperatures A turbine flowmeter with a magnetically levitated rotor has recently 
been developed for liquid helium service [58]
Turbine flowmeters have been successfully applied to He II service by Kashani et al 
[59] and Daney [60 61 ] As occurs with centrifugal pumps, turbine flowmeters display 
no unique performance characteristics except a tendency to cavitate in saturated He II at 
high flow rates Cavitation can be suppressed by adding a flow constriction to the outlet 
to increase the local pressure, although this modification will increase the unrecovered 
pressure drop through the system
Ventun flowmeters. 1 here are a variety of flowmeters that base their operations on 
Bernoulli’s principle that pressure drop occurs because of fluid acceleration through 
a narrow construction Examples of these are venturi flowmeters, orifice plates, and 
flow nozzles For an ideal inviscid fluid, a measurable pressure drop can occur without 
adding to the unrecovered pressure drop in the system Real fluids experience significant 
pressure losses in these devices The ventun flowmeter has the notable advantage of 
having minimum increased pressure loss and close to ideal performance There have 
been several attempts to adapt venturi flowmeters for He II service [62-63]
The general expression used to describe mass flow through a venturi flowmeter is

where D is the inlet diameter, fl is the throat to inlet diameter ratio and Cd is the 
discharge coefficient and is a measure of the degree of ideality in the flow Note that 
because tn Ap}/2 the span of pressure drop is large compared with that of the mass­
flow rate Practical limitations on pressure transducer technology usually limit the usable 
range of a ventun flowmeter to about one order of magnitude in m
Daney [601 measured the discharge coefficient of a ventun flowmeter equipped 
with a low temperature, differential-pressure transducer of the variable reluctance type 
The measured values of the discharge coefficient were observed to be very close to the 
ideal value of Cd = 1 Thus, the indications are that venturi operation is unaffected by 
the superfluid character of He II up to moderate fluid velocities Both Daney [61 ] and 
Walstrom et al [20) studied cavitation of He II in venturi flowmeters Cavitation can be 
observed as a discontinuous shift to the saturation pressure in the throat of the device
Fluidic flowmeters. Fluidic flowmeters use hydrodynamic instabilities to generate os­
cillations in a flow stream 1 he oscillations are then detected with pressure transducers, 
thermistors, or thin-film temperature sensors One type of fluidic flowmeter relies on 
the Coanda effect for its operation [64] 1 he Coanda effect refers to the deflection and 
attachment of a jet toward an adjacent surface Feedback loops are provided to cause 
fluidic oscillation In the turbulent flow regime the oscillation frequency of a fluidic 
flowmeter is linearly related to the fluid velocity
The operation of fluidic flowmeters for He II service has been verified [65] when
the flow oscillation^ were detected by measuring the pressure difference between two 
pressure ports located above the oscillating jet The amplitude of this oscillating pressure
signa] is proportional to the volumetric flow rate Thus, a clear advantage of this device
is a wider range of detectable flow rates for a
iven pressure transducer On the other
hand, a clear disadvantage of a fluidic flowmeter is a rather large unrecoverable pressure 
drop compared with other devices
Acoustic flowmeters. Acoustic or ultrasonic flowmeters work by measunn
the differ­
ences in transit times of sound waves traveling with or against the bulk flow In liquid 
helium, the speed of sound is temperature dependent and thus to be accurate the flowme­
ter requires isothermal conditions This allows tne elimination of the sound velocity from 
the analysis The expression used to calculate the bulk fluid flow velocity is then written as
u =
(10-45)
2
where z i 2 is the separation distance between the source and transducers 1 or 2 alon the
flow axis and /j 2 is the transit time for a signal to reach transducers 1 or 2 Hofmann 
and Vogeley [66] developed an ultrasonic flowmeter for He II In this case, inaccuracies 
in the dimensional measurements were eliminated by first measuring the difference in 
arrival times for static He II
In the application of an acoustic flowmeter, the distance between the transducers 
must be sufficient to produce a measurable difference m the transit times given the large 
velocity of first sound, about 200 m/s m He II At the same time the transducers must 
not be too far from the source to avoid attenuation of the pulses A reasonable \alue is

of flow velocity without introducing a major disturbance to the flow Because of limits 
to sensor resolution, this type of device is not very suitable for relatively low velocities,

 flowmeters. Temperature-pulse flowmeters operate by measuring 
the time of-flight of a thermal disturbance within a moving fluid As a result, the method 
is a direct measure of fluid velocity Usually the flowmeter works by the following 
sequence of events (1) a quantity of fluid is warmed by a pulsed electrical heater, (2) the 
region of warmed fluid is earned downstream by the bulk fluid flow and passes over one 
or two thermometers, and (3) the thermometer output and knowledge of the distances 
between heater and thermometers are then used to determine the flow velocity
Several groups have experimented with this type of flowmeter for He II Kashani
and Van Sciver [67| showed that heated regions of He II appear to propagate at the 
bulk fluid velocity Walstrom, et al [20] expenmented with time-of flight fluid veloc­
ity measurements However, this approach has limited usefulness because of the rapid 
diffusion of the heat pulse in the bulk fluid An alternative method would be to create 
a small region of He I and follow its propagation with flow, however, this approach 
would require the deposition of a large heat pulse with the associated disturbance of the 
helium [65]
Second sound flowmeters. The propagation of second sound (temperature or entropy 
waves) has been used to measure bulk flow velocity in He II In this case, a heat pulse 
propagates at the second sound velocity, which is about 20 m/s or a factor of 10 lower than
Ci, thus allowin
for improved resolution at low velocities Further, the signal is received
by sensitive thermometry rather than a pressure transducer In every other respect, a
second sound flowmeter works the same as an acoustic flowmeter The velocity may be 
determined by either a time-of-flight method or a phase shift approach, thus, Eq (10-43) 
still applies A prototype second sound flowmeter was developed by Holmes and Van
Sciver [68] This device used thm-film temperature sensors for detecting the signal
Other flowmetenng methods. A flowmetenng method that has received considerable 
interest m recent years is that of Laser Doppler (LD) velocimetry This method works by 
tracking neutral density particles suspended in the flow, thus providing a direct measure 
of fluid velocity The LD method is particularly useful for making local velocity mea­
surements because the lasers can be focused to a small spot (^1 mm) Laser Doppler 
velocimetry is also complex in its application and requires very sophisticated and ex­
pensive hardware, thus, its use is limited primarily to research studies
Although laser Doppler flowmeterina has not applied to bulk flowing He II, there
have been several successful attempts to use the method for studying counterflow in 
He II Murakami and coworkers [69,70] have demonstrated the use of LD to study an
He II counterflow jet A critical aspect of this method is the selection of suitable neutral 
densit} particles to achieve light scattering Murakami's group was successful usin 
glass microspheres and small particles of solid hydrogen-deutenum mixtures With this 
method they were able to characterize the flow of the normal fluid component in a

counterflow jet. The LD method appears to work well in its limited applications to He II, 
but it remains to be seen whether it can be effectively implemented in flowing He II. See 
chapter 4 on cryogenic instrumentation for further information.
10-4 SUMMARY 
■
The use of He II as a coolant in large-scale technical devices has expanded to the extent 
that it now represents a significant branch of cryogenic engineering. Development of 
such systems requires both a knowledge of conventional cryogenics principles as well 
as specific understanding of the behavior of He II. The present chapter is designed to 
provide the tools necessary to assist with future developments of He II cryogenic systems.

11-1 INTRODUCTION
Safety is primarily important in cryogenic engineering to protect personnel and property. 
A secondary reason for the importance of safety is that cryogenic equipment can be very 
expensive. To ensure the safety of a cryogenic project it is necessary that the system be 
designed and constructed to be as safe as possible and that it be operated safely Safe 
operation of a cryogenic system requires that the operation be thoroughly understood 
and that attention to safety practices is strictly followed. Past experience with operations 
that do not include the use of cryogenic fluids is not sufficient because the properties of 
cryogenic fluids and materials can vary considerably over the range of temperature from 
ambient temperature down to operating temperatures. For the design of the system and 
its operation, a thorough knowledge is required of all of the physical principles involved. 
Also, thorough and continuing training of operators is necessary [11.
11-2 SOURCES OF HAZARDS
In workin
with any cryogenic fluid, hazards that can arise include those that are phys­
iological and those that originate from physical (or mechanical) behavior of the fluids 
themsel ves or the structural material s in w hich they are contai ned. If work i nvol ves a com­
bustible cryogen or a combustion-enhancing substance like oxygen or oxy gen-enriched 
air, unwanted fires or even explosions can also be a concern [I ].
11-3 PHYSIOLOGICAL HAZARDS
Physiological hazards arise because of the very low temperatures of the cryogens, which 
can cause freezing of human tissue or hypothermia. Also of concern is the very large
481

482 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
expansion of cryogenic fluids as they evaporate with the resultant gas warming to ambient 
temperature (on the order of a thousand-fold multiplication in volume). Toxicity can give 
rise to an additional hazard, although with the more commonly encountered cryogens 
(oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and helium) this is not a problem.
11-3-1 Cold Damage to Living Tissue
The very cold temperatures of all cryogens is an obvious hazard if the fluid is allowed 
to come into contact with human tissue. Such contact can result in almost instantaneous 
freezing, and the resulting damage to the tissue is in some respects similar to a thermal
burn. Thus the term “cryogenic burn” is often encountered. Although it is of obvious
importance to prevent contact with either the liquid cryogen or the cold gas accompany i n
the liquid, an equally important precaution is to preclude the possibility of contact of 
flesh with any cold metal that is at cryogenic temperatures. A typical place where such 
cold metal might be encountered is in the vent system through which cold vapors could be 
passing. Obvious precautions include such measures as locating all ports where cryogenic 
fluids or cold vapors could be released in places where these fluids could not possibly 
impinge upon personnel. An equally important precaution is that of thermally insulating
any cold part of the system so that cold surfaces are not exposed where they could be 
inadvertently touched.
In workin
with systems at cryogenic temperatures, protective clothing should be
worn. Because the eyes are especially vulnerable, face shields or goggles should be used. 
As much of the body as practical should be covered by wearing long-sleeve shirts and 
long trousers with pant legs not being tucked into boots. Thermally insulating gloves 
should also be worn.
Contact with cold fluids or cold metal can freeze human tissue extremely fast. 
Freezing occurs when the tissue is cooled to a temperature of about ~3 °C (below 0°C 
because of the freezing point lowering as a result of dissolved solutes). If, in spite of the
necessary precautions being taken, a freezing of tissue should occur, first aid treatment
should consist of makin
the patient comfortable, gently removing any coverin clothing
(taking care not to tear any skin), and then gently warming the frozen part, preferably 
by immersion in warm water (40 to 42 °C, not above 44°C). Medical attention should
promptly be sought [2J.
Cold temperatures can harm human beings even if no tissue is frozen. Body heat is 
maintained by metabolism, muscle action, and shivering. If the body can not generate 
heat at the rate the heat is being removed, body temperature will continuously decrease, 
and hypothermia can result. If the body core temperature drops below 35 °C, a general
deterioration of the functionin
of the body organs can occur as well as that of the
nervous, cardiac, and respiratory systems. At temperatures below 28 °C, ventricular 
fibrillation becomes more likely [3]. In most cases, a person in an environment where 
hypothermia could be a problem can leave or escape. However, care should be taken 
to prevent situations in which a person might not be able to escape a rapid flow of 
exhausting cryogenic fluid, either because of the lack of an available exit or because of 
being rendered physically incapable of leaving. For this reason it is advisable to provide 
more than one path of egress from an experimental site and to forbid workers from 
working alone where a possibility of cold venting fluid could exist.

11-3-2 Asphyxiation
Table 11 -1 illustrates the large expansion that occurs when a iven volume of cryogenic
liquid evaporates and is warmed to ambient temperature, The table indicates that a 
relatively small quantity of a liquid cryogen, other than oxygen, can either displace, or 
at least dilute, the breathable atmosphere in a location near the spill of the liquid, This 
becomes even more hazardous in a closed location such as a small room. Table 11-2 
gives the consequences of oxygen depletion. However, these results must be taken as 
only an indication because there are differences in the response from one person to 
the next. Also, local atmospheric pressure can play a part. The important point is that 
depletion of the atmosphere to the point where the oxygen concentration is less than 
19.5% has been classified as an oxygen deficient atmosphere [4J.
Oxygen depletion is a serious hazard. It is even more insidious because one symptom
of anoxia is a general feeling of well being, or even euphoria, with the consequence that 
in this condition a person might not even try to extricate himself or herself from a 
hazardous location. A particularly dangerous situation for oxygen depletion is in the 
entry of personnel into tanks. This should never be attempted without a thorough, 
well-thought-out safety plan, including a method of removing a person, if necessary, 
without endangering an additional person. Even in the outdoors a hazardously depleted

concentration of oxygen can persist, especially in low areas where the colder, more
dense gases may be slow to disperse. Precautions against the hazard of oxygen depletion 
include limiting the amount of cryogenic fluid within enclosed spaces where personnel 
can be present, and oxygen monitorin
11-3-3 Toxicity
Although carbon dioxide is not toxic (and usually not considered a cryogen), it is worth 
mentionin
that an atmosphere with too much carbon dioxide can not allow the body
to get rid of the carbon dioxide that is formed by normal respiration. Breathing of an 
atmosphere with 10% carbon dioxide can result in unconsciousness in less than 1 minute.
An upper limit of 5000 ppm has been established for an 8-hour work day |5 J.
The truly toxic cryogens are carbon monoxide, fluorine, and ozone. Carbon monox­
ide has an affinity to combine with the hemoglobin in the blood that is 300 times as great 
as that of oxygen. Thus the body is starved of oxygen by chemical asphyxia. Breathing 
an atmosphere with 4000 ppm can result in death in less than 1 hour [6]. An upper limit 
for a 40-hour work week has been established at 25 ppm [7].
Fluorine presents a hazard by inhalation as well as from contact with the skin, where 
it can cause burns. The exposure limit is 1 ppm for a 40-hour work week. Fluorine’s 
pungent odor allows the human nose to be a good detector, for it can detect concentra­
tions down to about 0.14 ppm (8). Ozone is also toxic and is presumed to be fatal at 
concentrations above 50 ppm. The upper limit for human exposure has been placed at 
0.1 ppm (9).
11-4 PHYSICAL (OR MECHANICAL) HAZARDS
Physical hazards result from the effect of the low temperatures on structural materials 
being used to contain the cryogens and from some of the properties of the cryogens 
themselves.
11-4-1 Embrittlement
Cold temperatures can embrittle some materials at temperatures much warmer than those 
of cryogens. Recent investigations of the steel from the Titanic have shown that cold 
embrittlement may have played a part in the massive damage to that vessel in the cold 
iceberg environment of the North Atlantic Ocean. A cryogenic example of embrittlement 
is that of the rupture of a tank containing liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Cleveland, Ohio, 
in 1944. The steel chosen for this structure contained 3.5% nickel. This material has 
been shown to become brittle at the temperature of LNG (about 110 K). The tank rupture 
spilled over4000 m3 and resulted in over 100deaths and 200 injuries (IO).
An insight into the mechanism for cold embrittlement can be obtained from the
behavior of the yield and tensile stresses of a material as a function of temperature.
Figure 11-1 shows the behavior of an aluminum alloy that is a good material for cryogenic 
applications. As the temperature is lowered, the tensile strength increases at a greater 
rate than does the yield strength. Thus, the difference between these two parameters, 
which is an indication of ductility, also increases as temperature is lowered. Figure 11 -2,

in contrast, shows the behavior of a material that is not suitable for cryogenic service. In 
the case of Fig. 11 -2, the yield strength increases more rapidly than the tensile strength as 
the temperature is lowered with the consequence that eventually these two strengths are 
almost equal, indicating a brittle material. Good materials for cryogenic service include 
such metals as aluminum alloys, 300 series (austenitic) stainless steels, and copper [1].
If the structural materials are used to contain hydrogen, another type of embrittle­
ment is possible Although there are three types of hydrogen embrittlement, the type of 
concern here is termed “environmental hydrogen embrittlement,” which can occur by 
subjecting the equipment to hydrogen, usually at elevated pressure. Table 11-3 shows the 
consequences of hydrogen action on three different metals resulting in varying degrees 
of deterioration in their structural strengths. Several mechanisms have been proposed for 
the effect of hydrogen on metals, and it has been said that if the conditions are sufficiently 
stringent, hydrogen will affect almost any material,
Tests comparing strain to failure have shown that the magnitude of the effect of hy­
drogen is a function of temperature and is maximized at temperatures between 200 and 
300 K. Thus, one might think that hydrogen embrittlement is not a problem for cryogenic 
service. However, most cryogenic equipment that will contain hydrogen will see some 
service at ambient temperature, and large temperature gradients frequently exist in equip­
ment. Therefore, cryogenic materials for service with hydrogen must be chosen to be as 
resistant to hydrogen as possible. As with metals for cryogenic service, good materials 
for hydrogen service include aluminum alloys, copper, and stable austenitic stainless 
steels. In addition, it is important to avoid plastic strain in metals because straining the 
material in a hydrogen atmosphere promotes the embrittlement of the material [1].
11-4-2 Buildup of Pressure
One of the most commonly encountered hazards of handling cryogenic fluids comes from 
the unwanted buildup of pressure. That such large pressures can result does not come

as a surprise when one considers the large thermal expansion coefficient of the liquids 
and their very large expansion as evaporation and warming of the gases to ambient 
temperature occurs (see Table 11-1) However, the pressures that can be obtained by 
confining a volume of cryogenic liquid are much higher than one might compute by 
merely considering the volume ratios shown in Table 11-1 and using the ideal gas law
to compute a pressure.
As the pressure of a
as is increased sufficiently, the value of PV/RT becomes
significantly greater than 1 and continues to increase monotonically as the pressure 
is increased further [111. Table 11-4 shows the approximate maximum pressures that 
can be reached by attempting to maintain liquid density as the temperatures of three 
common cryogens are raised to ambient temperature. One way to attempt to maintain 
liquid density of a cryogenic liquid while allowing its temperature to rise to ambient 
levels is to have a pipe filled with liquid and then close two valves in series. Of course, 
the pressures would usually not be reached because the pipe walls would rupture before 
reaching that pressure in most cases.
Cryogenic storage vessels should never be totally filled with liquid, and usually a 
part of the storage volume above the liquid surface (called ullage) is reserved for the 
gas. Typical ullage volume is a minimum of 10% of the total volume of the vessel. If a
cryogenic storage vessel is closed off and not allowed to vent boil-off gas proportional 
to the heat leaked into the vessel, the storage pressure will rise and the temperature of
the stored fluid will rise with it. The thermal expansion coefficients of the common
cryogens are listed in Table 11-5. That they are large can be seen from the comparison
with water at its normal boiling point. If the temperature of the liquid rises sufficiently,

the liquid can completely fill the vessel, a situation that is termed “liquid full.” At this 
point a much faster pressure rise rate can be expected, which can lead quickly to the 
explosion of the vessel
Another frequently encountered mechanism for a more rapid pressure rise in aclosed 
cryogenic system is that of thermal stratification. The heat that enters the storage volume 
at the bottom of the vessel will heat the entire volume of contained fluid. However, the 
heat that enters the sides warms the adjacent liquid, which then travels up along the wall 
of the vessel until it accumulates atthe liquid surface. Because the pressure in the vessel is 
established by the temperature of the liquid surface, this unequal distribution of incoming 
energy will cause a pressure rise rate that can be as great as ten times the normal rise 
rate if all of the incoming heat were to be distributed equally within the entire volume 
of the liquid (see Fig. 11-3).
In cases where it is necessary to close off a storage volume, some mechanism to
prevent thermal stratification is usually provided to preclude the premature venting of 
the fluid and maintain acceptable pressures within the vessel. Because of the vibration, a

highway transport will have a lower pressure rise rate as long as it is driven over the road. 
When the highway transport is stopped, the pressure rise rate can increase dramatically 
owing to thermal stratification [ 1J. Another method to prevent thermal stratification that 
has been proven effective is the inclusion of thermal shorts of high-thermal-conductivity 
material, which tend to equalize the temperature between the surface and the lower re­
gions in the storage volume. Even the addition of a noncondensable gas stream at the bot­
tom of the vessel to stir the fluid has been effective in preventing thermal stratification [1 ].
Because of the potential of unacceptable pressuresarising within a cryogenic system 
it is necessary to provide for pressure relief in case the pressure in the system should 
start to rise above an acceptable level. There are several types of volumes that require 
pressure relief. The most obvious of these volumes is that in which the liquid is present, 
such as a storage volume or cryogen bath. A similar volume is found in a transfer line 
between two valves that can be closed. A less obvious volume is that containing a gas or 
condensed liquid in a volume being cooled by an external bath of cryogen or a flowing 
stream of refrigerant gas.
For the storage of the lower-boiling cryogenic liquids (neon, hydrogen, or helium)
an evacuated insulation space is usually necessary for therm al isolation of the cold system. 
These three liquids are sufficiently cold that if any air were to enter the evacuated insu­
lation system, the air will condense on the cold inner surface of the insulation space and 
at that temperature will exert essentially zero vapor pressure. Table 11-6 presents some 
approximate vapor pressures of higher-boiling substances at the temperature of liquid hy­
drogen and liquid helium. The condensed solid air will, therefore, ive no evidence of its
presence until the colder liquid being stored is removed. At that time the trapped air can 
evaporate and exert its full pressure, which can be sufficient to explode the outer vacuum 
jacket or implode the inner vessel. For this reason pressure relief must also be provided 
for the vacuum jackets in systems containing the lower-boiling cryogenic liquids.
A standard for pressure relief devices is given by the Compressed Gas Associa­
tion [12]. In general the relief valves should be sized to allow the maximum flow of

exiting fluid that can be anticipated at the maximum allowable pressure in the storage 
volume. Usually a failure of the insulation system (such as a complete loss of vacuum) is 
considered. Also, in the case of a transport vessel, the possible upset of the vessel should 
be considered because it might result in the gas vent location being below the liquid 
surface. In this case it will be necessary to vent a liquid volume sufficient to maintain a 
safe pressure within the vessel. If the vessel contains a device capable of storing energy, 
such as a superconducting magnet, the pressure rise caused by the sudden dissipation of 
the stored energy into the fluid must also be considered.
Another mechanism for increasing the rate of pressure rise in a cryogenic storage 
volume is that of pressure oscillations. In the case of heating a flowing cryogenic liquid, 
the possibility and severity of these pressure oscillations depend upon the rate of heat 
transfer. A correlation describing the onset and severity of these oscillations is available 
in the literature [1]. For the colder-boiling cryogens, hydrogen and helium, oscillations 
can be excited by connecting the cold storage volume to ambient temperature by means, 
for example, of a tube to a pressure gauge. If this problem occurs, a change in the pressure 
measurement system might be necessary. The important parameters are the ratio of the 
temperatures at the ends of the tube, the tube diameter, and the temperature gradient 
along the tube [131.
Table 11-7 shows that the colder the normal boiling point of the cryogen, the more 
difficult is its handling. As seen in Table 11-7, this increased difficulty occurs because, 
as the normal boiling point temperature becomes lower, the heat of vaporization per unit 
volume of liquid also decreases. Added to this is the fact that, as the boiling temperature 
becomes lower, the difference in temperature (the driving force inducing heat into the 
cold system) is also increasing.
The storage of LNG presents a special hazard of pressure rise. This has been termed 
“rollover.” Liquefied natural gas is not a single component fluid. Rather, it consists of 
several constituents, each with a different vapor pressure and a different density at a given 
temperature. Heat enters the tank both at the sides and the bottom. The liquid at the top 
can lose heat by evaporation, whereas the bottom can only lose heat by conduction to 
the top layer. This results in a warmer layer at the bottom, which becomes less dense as 
its temperature rises. At the same time the top of the liquid becomes heavier as it loses

its lighter components. Eventually the difference in densities can cause a rolling Ov 
of the liquid so that the warmer liquid moves to the top, where it will evaporate mo 
rapidly without the pressure of the hydrostatic head above it [14). The large increase of 
boil-off vapors can be a hazard because they arc combustible.
11-4-3 Condensation of Atmospheric Gases 
and Higher-Boiling Substances
All cryogens can condense water vapor and carbon dioxide and many other compounds 
Table 11-6 shows how low the vapor pressure is for several substances that could be 
condensed. Liquid nitrogen, liquid hydrogen, and liquid helium (or even the cold vapors 
from the latter two) can condense oxygen or air. This is likely to occur if these fluids, or 
cold vapors from these fluids, are passed through an uninsulated pipeline.
In general, the condensate from atmospheric air, condensing on an exposed surfaceat 
liquid nitrogen temperature, or colder, is more hazardous than liquid air. The composition 
of this condensate is about 50% oxygen, and subsequent evaporation can further enrich 
the oxygen content. Figure 11-4 shows the composition of condensate if air with 21%
Figure 11-4
Composition
Oxygen-nitrogcn phase diagram showing ambient and condensate compositions.

492 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
oxygen is condensed on a cold surface. This condensate, liquid air, or liquid oxygen 
can all change the combustibility characteristics of many materials and, if falling upon 
combustible materials, can cause fire or explosion hazards
The cold liquid can also cause low-temperature embrittlement if it falls upon ma­
terials that are not suitable for low-temperature service. Such an event has caused the 
cracking of deck plates of a barge being used to carry liquid hydrogen and has also 
cracked the carbon steel outer shell of a liquid hydrogen storage Dewar. In improp­
erly purged systems, this type of condensation will take place internally, Even if there 
is no combustibility hazard, the presence of an inert solid can still cause safety prob­
lems by blocking the opening to relief valves or causing erosion of valve seats, for 
example.
11-4-4 Stresses Caused by Thermal Contraction
Dimensional changes can cause excess stresses. The thermal expansion coefficient de 
creases as temperature is lowered and is very small by the time 77 K is reached. Fig­
ure 11 -5 shows the behavior of the thermal expansion coefficient of copperas a function of 
temperature. The behavior of steels is similar. Because the thermal expansion coefficient 
decreases so much by the time the temperature of liquid nitrogen is reached, not much fur­
ther contraction occurs below this temperature. For detailed design, actual values should 
be used, but, as a rule of thumb, we can estimate the thermal contraction of copper and 
steels to be about 0.3% from room temperature down to liquid nitrogen temperature and 
any lower temperature. The corresponding value for aluminum is about 0.4%. In general,
Temperature (K)

SAFETY 493
plastics have much higher thermal expansion coefficients, but they vary considerably. 
Figure 11-6 shows total thermal contraction of various materials as the temperature is 
lowered from ambient temperature to temperatures within the cryogenic range [1],
In general this contraction must be accommodated. Consider the stress that could 
result if steel were held fast and not allowed to contract while being cooled to a cryogenic 
temperature. From the rule-of-thumb for steel mentioned in the previous paragraph, the 
strain will be 0.3% (or 0.003). Using an elastic modulus E of 30 million pounds per 
square inch one can compute the resulting stress. Because E is equal to stress/strain, 
stress = E x strain = 90,000 psi if contraction is not allowed. This is greater than 
the yield stress and might be greater than the tensile strength, With Invar it might be 
acceptable to restrict thermal contraction because the total contraction is only about 
one-sixth as great, and the elastic modulus is also smaller. However, the stress on the 
rest of the system would have to be considered.
Dimensional changes caused by thermal contraction must be considered in transfer 
line design.
*
 This can be done by using expansion bellows or by building in flexibility 
(“U” sections or elbows). One can analyze a piping system for thermal stresses by 
hand calculations for simple cases; for large systems a computer analysis is needed 
(a number of computer codes exist). First allow the line to contract to its new dimensions; 
then stretch the ends back to the anchors and compute stresses, bending moments, and
‘Additional information on transfer line design may be found in chapter 5 of this handbook.

494 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
Figure 11-7 Schematic of cryogenic transfer line before and after coding
displacements (Figure 11-7 shows an exaggerated view of the hne after cooling to 
operating temperature ) If stresses are found to be too great, it is necessary to include 
more or larger “U ’ bends or elbows If this is not desirable, flexible piping can be used 
if the additional pressure drop is not excessive For vacuum-jacketed lines it may also 
be necessary to allow for motion of the vacuum jacket by the use of expansion bellows
The previous considerations are for acase at thermal equilibrium Thermal transients 
can give rise to thermal gradients (and stresses) during processes like cooling a piece of 
equipment from room temperature down to operating temperature A thick flange can 
reach liquid hydrogen temperature at the inner surface while still at room temperature at 
the outer surface Under these conditions it is also necessary to know something about the 
temperature gradient to estimate the thermal stress because the stresses can depend upon 
the shape of the thermal gradient as well as the total temperature difference Therefore, 
cooling flow rates must not be too fast, and some maximum permissible cooling flow 
rates have been calculated by Novak [15]
Cooling a piece of equipment like a long, horizontal transfer line too slowly can 
result in another type of thermal stress Usually a transfer line is cooled by introducing a 
flow of the cryogen through the line when it is initially at ambient temperature The hne 
is then cooled by evaporation of the cryogen A snapshot illustration of the line at some 
time during the cooling process shows that several types of flow can occur within the hne 
When the hne is partially cooled, the initial portion of the hne will be filled with liquid 
Downstream of this portion is a length that is still not at the temperature of the liquid and 
therefore is being cooled by heating the liquid and causing some two-phase flow Even 
further downstream the liquid has all been evaporated, and the cold gas is precoohng the 
hne while the vapor is warming up to close to ambient temperature If the two-phase 
flow is stratified flow, it is possible for the bottom of the line to cool faster than the top 
This can cause the hne to bow upwards and may cause unacceptable thermal stresses 
A more detailed discussion of this phenomenon may be found in the literature fl]
11-5 COMBUSTION HAZARDS
Two of the commonly encountered cryogens (hydrogen and LNG) are flammable and 
can give rise to the hazard of unwanted combustion In addition, oxygen is a strong 

SAFETY 49s
promoter of combustion and can present a similar hazard Although this latter hazard ls 
more obvious in the case of pure oxygen, liquid air is also hazardous, and, as pointed 
out in section 11-4-3, air condensing from the normal atmosphere can have an oxygen 
concentration of up to 50% (see Fig 11-4) and is even more hazardous than liquid mr
11-5-1 Fuels (Hydrogen and LNG)
Three ingredients are needed for combustion to occur These are a fuel, an oxidizer 
and an ignition source Safety of operation requires that, wherever possible, the attempt 
should be made to eliminate two of these three at a given location Consequently every 
effort must be made to eliminate ignition sources Ignition sources include such obvious 
things as open flames, smoking, and welding Less obvious and more difficult to control 
ignition sources include static electricity, sparking devices, high-velocity impact of solid 
particles, heat of rapid compression, and friction The elimination of these ignition 
sources requires precautions such as using approved electrical devices, assuring the 
absence of unwanted solid particles within the system, properly designing equipment 
and properly operating the system [ 11
Combustible mixtures must also be avoided This effort involves complete purging 
of residual air from the system before introducing the combustible cryogen In the case 
of hydrogen, everything other than helium can be condensed to a solid at the temperature 
of the liquid hydrogen This results in another reason for complete purging because, even 
if not combustible, such particles can cause erosion of valve seats or can block access to 
relief valve ports
Flammable substances are ignitable within a range of composition that is dependent 
upon temperature and pressure of the mixture Combustion can be a reaction of fuel and 
oxidizer that is controlled by heat transfer from the burning substances into the adjacent 
combustible mixture, heating it to its ignition temperature This combustion reaction 
is called “deflagration" A more vigorous reaction occurs if the combustible mixture 
is heated to the ignition temperature by a shock wave This is termed “detonation’ 
Although either of these reactions presents a definite hazard, detonation is generally 
much more serious Concentration ranges of combustibility and detonabihty can be 
found in the literature [ 1,16,17)
11-5-2 Oxidizers
Oxygen is sufficiently reactive that almost anything that is not already completely oxi­
dized can be made to burn if the nght conditions exist Stainless steel has been known 
to bum in the presence of liquid oxygen Consequently, in the handling of oxygen 
two of the three ingredients necessary for combustion (fuel and oxidizer) are almost al 
ways present This fact makes even more important the elimination of ignition sources, 
including ail of those mentioned above
Liquid air (21% oxygen) and air condensed from the atmosphere are also hazardous 
substances, but, as the oxygen content is increased, the mixture becomes even more 
hazardous Figure 11-8 illustrates the increase in reactivity of a substance as the oxygen 
concentration is increased In this case an adhesive (HT-424) is used as an illustration

496 HANDBOOK OF CRYOGENIC ENGINEERING
Impact Energy (kg m)

However, similar behavior is obtained with many materials. The data shown are for tests 
in which a variable mass is dropped on a striker pin attached to the specimen, which 
is immersed in the liquid oxygen-nitrogen mixture. From the number of ignitions, as 
shown in Fig. 11-8, it can be seen that, although a 50% oxygen mixture is not as reactive 
as 100% oxygen, it still is much more reactive than true liquid air (21% oxygen) [18].
Safety in working with oxygen requires the proper selection of materials and scrupu­
lous cleanliness. Materials with high ignition temperatures, high specific heats, high 
thermal conductivity, and low heats of reaction are desirable [1,19]. Cleanliness is im­
portant because most impurities will have lower ignition temperatures. If the impurities 
ignite, this combustion can subsequently ignite materials that otherwise would not 
have been ignited. Several cleaning methods and cleaning agents are recommended 
[1,20].
11-6 REGULATIONS, STANDARDS, AND GUIDELINES
There are three types of safety documents. Regulations are enacted by governmental 
bodies and have the force of law. Standards (also known as codes) are usually issued 
by associations with a wide range of members as a means of ensuring that common 
safety interests are met in a uniform and predictable manner. Standards are typically 
thought of as representing the consensus of technical experts on the subject at hand. 
Guidelines are developed by organizations based on their specific needs. The three types 
of documents are not mutually exclusive. Regulations frequently incorporate standards, 
either directly or by reference, thus giving them the force of law. Standards often refer to 
other standards or regulations to avoid repetition and to reduce inconsistencies, which can 
develop when differing groups cover the same subject matter. Guidelines can require 

SAFETY 497
members or employees of their organization to follow standards and frequently cite 
relevant regulations and standards to ensure they arc applied when appropriate.
There are usually several levels at which governmental regulations can be estab­
lished. These range from cities or counties at the local level, to states or provinces at 
the regional level, and to the federal or national government at the highest level. In 
the United States, for example, national regulations are found in the Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR). The two titles most relevant to cryogenics are Title 29, Labor, which 
covers occupational safety and health and Title 49, Transportation, which covers the 
transportation of hazardous materials. In addition, groups of nations can develop con­
sistent standards through organizations such as the International Standards Organization 
(ISO) and then incorporate these standards into regulations or treaties. 
J-
In addition to the ISO, many nations have their own standards organizations. It is not 
possible to list them all here, but representative associations in the United States include 
the following: American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), American Na­
tional Standards Institute (ANSI), American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), 
National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), Factory Mutual Engineering and Research 
(FM), and the Compresssed Gas Association (CGA). In addition to their safety value, 
many of these standards provide useful design information.
Guidelines are developed by companies, laboratories, and universities to address 
the specific needs of each organization. They are frequently available upon request and 
can provide valuable information and advice. All of the above documents can change 
with time, and thus one must be aware of the latest developments to ensure that current 
safety documents are followed.
11-7 CONCLUSIONS
At this point it should be clear that safety is a philosophy that must be integrated into all 
aspects of any cryogenic project. It is notan afterthought that can be adequately addressed 
after a system has been designed or built. Consideration of safety should begin at the 
conceptual design phase and continue through final design, procurement of equipment, 
fabrication, and assembly. Careful consideration at the conceptual design phase can often 
eliminate problems that will require complicated and expensive corrections if addressed 
later.
Safety is not finished when a project becomes operational, Operation requires plan­
ning, which includes established standard operating procedures and written checklists 
as well as previously thought-out responses to unexpected behavior of systems and 
emergencies (contingency checklists). It is important to avoid modifying any system 
without examining all of the possible consequences. Many accidents are caused by the 
unexpected consequences of quick repairs instituted without a thorough understanding 
of all aspects of system operation.
- Finally, training of personnel should be a continuing effort and should not merely 
be passed from one employee to the next without some referral back to the fundamental 
safety requirements of the system. Without structured training of new personnel there 
is no way to be sure that all hazards are identified and all safety issues are adequately 
addressed.
