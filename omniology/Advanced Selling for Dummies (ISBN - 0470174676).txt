practice the lessons they have learned . . . and succeeded because of it.
From Joe: To my brother Greg, the salesman of the family, whose talents and
skills I appreciate infinitely more after working on this book.
Authors’ Acknowledgements
Although we wrote the book, several other talented individuals contributed
to its conception, development, and perfection. We give special thanks to the
following contributors, who collaborated with us on the development of
chapters in their areas of expertise:
Terry Wisner created the Personal Partnering Process™to help people
become more successful both personally and professionally. He shares his
insights from over 30 years of sales and human performance improvement in
Chapter 7.
Kandra Hamric (www.KandraHamric.com), a top virtual assistant, speaks on
the topic of maximizing productivity with virtual assistants, and she shows
you in Chapter 13 just how to use assistants to take your business to the next
level.
Terry Brock (www.terrybrock.com) is a professional speaker and a colum-
nist for Business Journals around the United States. In Chapter 14, Terry reveals
the secret of R-Commerce — a powerful networking concept that calls for re-
focusing your attention and energy on relationships—the unquantifiable factor
in sales success.
Richard Nacht is the founder and CEO of Blogging Systems Group (www.

Special thanks also go to acquisitions editor Lindsay Lefevere, who chose us
to author this book and guided us through the tough part of getting started.
Jennifer Connolly, our project editor, deserves a loud cheer for acting as a
very patient collaborator and gifted editor — shuffling chapters back and
forth, shepherding the text and photos through production, making sure any
technical issues were properly resolved, and serving as unofficial quality con-
trol manager. We also tip our hats to the production crew for doing such an
outstanding job of transforming a loose collection of text and illustrations
into such an attractive bound book.
Throughout the writing of this book, we relied heavily on a knowledgeable and
dedicated support staff, who provided expert advice, tips, and research, so we
could deliver the most comprehensive and useful information. Lois Maljak proved
invaluable not only as a resource person but also as the communications hub
for the flurry of files and e-mail messages flying back and forth on a daily basis.
We owe special thanks to our technical editor, Jeff Lee, for ferreting out tech-
nical errors in the manuscript, helping guide its content, and offering his own
tips and tricks and insights from the world of corporate sales.

Advanced Selling For Dummies

Introduction
You can find all sorts of books and tapes revealing the “secrets” of sales
success — books on solution selling, strategic selling, new strategic sell-
ing, spin selling, question-based selling, customer-centric selling, how to
close a sale, and so on. Becoming a top salesperson, however, requires much
more than asking a customer questions and then pitching your products and
services. 
Those who achieve the pinnacle of sales success act more like entrepreneur-
ial small-business owners. They market and advertise, engage in unrelenting
shameless self-promotion, constantly expand their address books with new
contacts, develop synergistic partnerships, investigate new markets, take
risks, implement the latest technologies to boost productivity, hire assistants
to grow their business, and much more. 
In Advanced Selling For Dummies, I reveal the not-so-secret secret to becom-
ing your own best-seller — you have to develop a positive attitude, work hard
and smart, and stick to it. You need to get up to speed with 21st century busi-
ness management and discover the power of virtual assistants, blogs, email
drip campaigns, Internet lead generation, social media, and other cutting
edge and bleeding edge tools and resources.
I show you how to do everything I’ve done over the past 30 years and con-
tinue to do as a highly successful salesperson. Follow in my footsteps, and
you’re much more likely to attain the sales success you’re committed to
achieving.
I have to warn you, though — what I do is not easy. This is not a Ten-Minute
Guide to Sales Success. You have to work at it. When I tell you to make 100
phone calls a day, you have to do it. When I tell you to hire an assistant, don’t
tell me you can’t afford to. When I tell you that you need to set up your own
Web site or blog, don’t give me some excuse that you don’t have the technolog-
ical know-how. Just do it. You can start slow, but schedule it and get ’er done.
About This Book
Far too many salespeople relinquish themselves to what they consider is a
painful reality — they can’t sell, because nobody wants what they’re selling.
Mediocre salespeople are constantly telling me, “Bring me a customer, and I
can sell.” They rely far too much on the company they work for to market the
products and services and they do little or nothing to market themselves.

2
Advanced Selling For Dummies 
Entrepreneurial salespeople, on the other hand, blame nobody. Instead, 
they drum up their own business. They make business happen. They become
revenue-generating machines, no matter where they work or what they sell.
In this book, I offer you a vast collection of strategies, techniques, and tips on
how to become a revenue-generating machine. I show you how to believe in
and motivate yourself, develop a winning game plan, hone your sales skills,
market yourself online and off, take yourself to the next level with personal
partnering, embrace change, take risks, become more productive with the
right technologies and assistants, tap the power of R-Commerce through net-
working and personal partnering, and much more.
Advanced Selling For Dummies is designed to present this loose collection of
sales tips and tricks in an easily digestible format that enables you to skip
around. You can certainly read the book from cover to cover, but if you prefer
to focus first on a specific area, such as blogging, you can simply skip to that
chapter and dive right in.
Conventions Used in This Book
Compared to other selling programs and books, Advanced Selling For
Dummies is anything but conventional, but I do use some conventions to call
your attention to certain items. For example:
 Italics highlight new, somewhat technical terms, such as R-Commerce,
and emphasize words when I’m driving home a point. 
 Boldface text indicates key words in bulleted and numbered lists.
 Monofont highlights Web site, blog, and email addresses.
In addition, even though you see two author names on the cover of this book —
Ralph and Joe — and I consulted with half a dozen experts who specialize in
various areas of selling, you see “I” throughout the book when I, Ralph, am
describing my personal experiences with selling and offering my expert advice.
Joe’s the wordsmith — the guy responsible for keeping you engaged and enter-
tained and making sure I’ve explained everything as clearly and thoroughly as
possible. Joe is admittedly not much of a salesperson, although he did manage
to sell me on the idea of working with him . . . or did I sell him on the idea of
working with me?
What You’re Not to Read
Although I encourage you to read this book from cover to cover to maximize
the return on your investment, Advanced Selling For Dummies facilitates a

skip-and-dip approach. It presents the information in bite-sized bits, so 
you can skip to the chapter or section that grabs your attention or meets
your current needs, master it, and then skip to another section or simply set
the book aside for later reference.
Feel free to skip any sections you feel as though you’ve already mastered. If, for
example, you feel as though you are a highly motivated person who doesn’t
need to set goals, you can safely skip Chapter 2, “Visualizing Yourself as a
Power Seller.” If you already have several assistants to support your efforts,
skip Chapter 13, “Picking the Right People to Fill the Gaps.”
You can also safely skip anything you see in a gray shaded box. I stuck it in a
box for the same reason that most people stick stuff in boxes — to get it out
of the way, so you wouldn’t trip over it. However, you may find the stories
and brief asides uproariously funny and perhaps even mildly informative (or
vice versa).
Foolish Assumptions
The biggest foolish assumption I make in this book is that you’ve already had
some basic training on the fine art of selling. Specifically, I assume you’ve
already read the first book in this “mini-series,” Selling For Dummies (Wiley)
by Tom Hopkins, one of my earliest role models. Hopkins gets you up to
speed in a hurry on the art of selling, the need to know your products and
your customers, and how to sell effectively throughout the “seven-step sell-
ing cycle.” If you haven’t yet read Selling For Dummies, put down this book
right now, buy that book, and read it. I’ll be waiting for you when you’re done.
The other foolish assumption I make is that you’re committed to your own
success. Becoming a top-producing salesperson is hard work and requires
sticktoitism (pronounced stik-to-it-izm) — a word I’ve been using since the
1970s to describe the determination and dogged perseverance required to
achieve success and build wealth. I could use “stick-to-itiveness,” which hap-
pens to appear in the dictionary, but I like my word better. 
I can’t force you to put into action the strategies and systems I describe in
this book. You have to be so committed to your success that you take the
next step and practice what I preach. Although it’s difficult, it is not impossi-
ble. I do it, and I know dozens of “average” salespeople who have managed to
put my recommendations into practice. They’ve since become much more
than average, and you can expect the same results.

Introduction

How This Book Is Organized
I wrote this book so you could approach it in either of two ways. You can pick
up the book and flip to any chapter for a quick, stand-alone mini-course on a
specific advanced selling topic, or you can read the book from cover to cover.
To help you navigate, I took the 22 chapters that make up the book and
divvied them up into six parts. Here, I provide a quick overview of what I
cover in each part.
Part I: Mastering the Sales 
Success Mindset
Attitude plays a major role in success. If you believe in yourself, your com-
pany, your customers, and your products and services, you have most of
what you need to succeed. In this part, I show you how to visualize yourself
as a top-producing salesperson, draw up your personalized plan for success,
make selling more of a hobby and a habit instead of a boring job, and remove
any obstacles that may be limiting your upside. When your mind is right and
your vision clear, you are well-prepared to implement the sales strategies and
systems that can significantly boost sales.
Part II: Pumping Up Your Sales Muscle
The chapters in this part lead you through your sales calisthenics and reveal
various techniques to take your skills to the next level. In Chapter 6, I offer a
more advanced perspective on selling basics, showing you how to approach
a customer, ask questions, deliver your presentation, and eventually close
the sale.
In the remaining chapters, I reveal techniques I practice to become a more
effective salesperson, enhance my career, and get more out of life, both pro-
fessionally and personally. Here you discover how to implement a self-
improvement strategy called personal partnering, embrace change as a
growth strategy, build a brand presence through shameless self-promotion,
and take the risks necessary to achieve higher levels of sales success.
Part III: Equipping Yourself with
Advanced Selling Tools and Resources
As an entrepreneurial salesperson, you are a small-business owner. As such,
you need to invest time and money in building your business. The chapters
4
Advanced Selling For Dummies 

in this part show you just how to accomplish this. In Chapter 11, I guide you
in selecting the self-improvement tools and resources that promise the
biggest return on your investment of both time and money. In subsequent
chapters, I focus on getting you geared up with productivity-boosting tech-
nologies and personnel that enable you to achieve higher levels of success
than would otherwise be possible.
Part IV: Prospecting for Sales
Opportunities
Good salespeople target markets. Great sales people become targets. They
create a high profile and put a human face on whatever they sell, so that
prospective customers come calling. The chapters in this part show you how
to take a long-term approach to sales by building a strong reputation as the
go-to guy or gal for a particular product or service. You may not see immedi-
ate results, but over time, all of your efforts eventually pay off. You no longer
have to sell — you simply facilitate the purchase.
Part V: Teaming Up with Your 
Customers . . . and Competitors
One of the best ways to become a top producer is to surround yourself with
success. Make your customers, colleagues, and even your competitors suc-
cessful, and you soon find that the culture of success you built around you
lifts you higher and higher. The chapters in this part reveal various strategies
for ensuring the success of your customers, multicultural clients, and your
competition. Here you also discover the powerful paradox of giving to give
instead of giving to get.
Part VI: Part of Tens
Every For Dummies title comes complete with a Part of Tens — two or more
chapters that each contain ten strategies, tips, tricks, or other important
items to keep in mind. In Advanced Selling For Dummies, the Part of Tens
offers ten power selling tactics and techniques and ten ways to break out of a
sales slump. Not only do you receive the tools required to succeed, but you
also get the motivation to use those tools.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, I’ve sprinkled icons in the margins to cue you in on dif-
ferent types of information that call out for your attention. Here are the icons
you’ll see and a brief description of each.
I want you to remember everything you read in this book, but if you can’t
quite do that, then remember the important points I flag with this icon.
Tips provide insider insight from behind the scenes. When you’re looking for
a better, faster, cheaper way to do something, check out these turbo tips.
“Whoa!” This icon appears when you need to be extra vigilant or seek profes-
sional assistance before moving forward.
Where to Go from Here
Advanced Selling For Dummies offers you a collection of sales tools you can
add to you repertoire in any order you wish. The more you add, and the
faster you add them, and the more use you make of them, the higher you
climb and the faster you get there.
If you’re looking for a quick course on advanced selling, check out Chapter 1,
which provides a sampler plate with a small taste of everything contained in
the book. I strongly recommend that you read Chapter 2, as well, where Mr.
Positive (Dave Boufford) and I motivate you and assist you in setting your
course. If you don’t have a positive attitude and a clear vision of where you’re
going, you have very little chance of getting there. Chapter 9 on shameless
self-promotion is also a must-read.
You also don’t want to miss the chapters I collaborated on with other sales
specialists, including 
 Chapter 7, “Raising the Bar with Personal Partnering”
 Chapter 13, “Picking the Right People to Fill the Gaps”
 Chapter 14, “Harnessing People Power with R-Commerce”
 Chapter 17, “Exploring Opportunities in the Virtual World: Social Media”
 Chapter 19, “Appealing to Multicultural Clientele”

Advanced Selling For Dummies 

My wish is that you achieve whatever level of sales success you dream of and
work hard enough and smart enough to attain. Keep in mind that this wish
can be a curse. If you don’t put into practice what I recommend in this book,
you are most likely to remain an average or below-average salesperson. For
average people, that may be good enough, but this book isn’t for average
salespeople. You’re better than that, and you deserve more than that. Your
spouse and family deserve more than that, too. If you’re going to be away
from your family for 8 to 12 hours a day, you’d better make sure that they’re
benefiting from your efforts while you’re at work. After all, why take time
away from your family only to pursue mediocrity?

Part I
Mastering the
Sales Success
Mindset

In this part . . .
I
n any field of endeavor, especially selling, success
requires the right mindset, the proper attitude. You
have to visualize yourself as the success you want to be,
set challenging goals, develop a rock-solid game plan for
achieving those goals, and then make selling an activity
that’s as natural as breathing.
In this part, I show you how to get in character and sell
yourself on the idea of success. As long as you believe you
can be a top seller and then start acting like you are, you
can’t help but become the sales success you’re destined
to be.

Chapter 1
Boosting Sales with 
Advanced Selling
In This Chapter
 Defining success on your own terms
 Fueling success with people power
 Believing in and then selling yourself
 Generating ideas, leads, and opportunities
 Building a culture of success
A
dvanced selling is the full-court press approach to achieving success. It
requires clear vision, careful planning, shameless self-promotion, a dis-
cerning vigilance, the ability and willingness to take calculated risks, and a
dogged determination that I like to refer to as sticktoitism.
Advanced selling is about more than boosting sales and profits, although
that’s certainly a part of it and is probably the biggest reason you’re reading
this book. The strategies and tips you master as an advanced seller can also
be applied to other aspects of your life to achieve both your professional and
personal goals.
In this chapter, I reveal what goes into making a top-producing salesperson
and assist you in discovering what you need to accomplish to achieve your
goals, whatever they may be. 

12
Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 
Defining and Achieving 
Your Own Destiny
Selling is like life itself — you’re free to define “success” in your own terms
and then plot your own course to get there. For one salesperson, success
may be measured in status, and being the top salesperson in the company
would be the ultimate achievement. For someone else, success may mean
lots of money to afford a certain lifestyle. Others may want more time to
spend with friends and family or an early retirement. You may have some
other goal in mind.
Your destiny is yours to define and achieve. Don’t let anyone else define what
“happiness” should mean for you. Even if you were to achieve your goals,
your happiness and satisfaction would always elude you, because you would
be achieving someone else’s dream.
In the following sections, I guide you through the process of establishing a
positive mindset, setting goals, and plotting your course. For additional
details, check out Chapters 2 and 3.
As motivational speaker Art Fettig told me, “It’s hard to be healthy, wealthy,
and happy at the same time.” However, striving to achieve a balanced life that
leads to health, wealth, and happiness is certainly a noble pursuit.
Establishing a positive mindset
Success stands at the end of many different journeys, but it always begins
with the right attitude — a positive mindset. If you’ve been around negative
people all your life, your mindset may be holding you back.
Just as buggy software can bog down a computer and cause it to crash, nega-
tive thoughts can slow you down and derail your efforts to succeed. You may
have to reboot your mind and fill it with positive affirmations and a strong
belief that you are perfectly capable of achieving your dreams. Here are some
suggestions on how to give yourself a positive attitude adjustment:
 Find a sales hero — a role model to inspire you.
 Shadow a successful salesperson to find out how they achieve success.
 Read inspirational books or listen to motivational tapes.
 Fill your mind with positive affirmations.
 Hang out with positive people and avoid naysayers.

Surround yourself with positive thoughts, people, and experiences, so nega-
tivity has no space to take root and grow. If negative thoughts begin to creep
in, visit my friend Mr. Positive, Dave Boufford, at www.MrPositive.com. He
can get you pumped up in a hurry. 
You would be surprised at the number of top salespeople or speakers who
would welcome the opportunity to meet with you, share a cultural event, or
join you for dinner when they’re passing through your town. If you know that
one of your sales heroes is going to be in town, try to contact the person and
arrange a meeting. This can be the perfect opportunity to meet your hero in
person and begin a relationship that may develop into a mentoring situation. 
Setting stimulating goals
Most sales coaches stress that goals should be realistic, which is somewhat
true, but realistic goals that don’t make you stretch are of little use. I prefer
to encourage the salespeople I coach to set stimulating goals. A goal should
always make you reach outside your comfort zone. It should always include
some level of risk. A good goal should include the following:
 Statement of the goal
 Starting date
 Completion date
 Statement of how success is going to be measured
Sales quotas can do more harm than good, particularly if they are pinned to a
deadline. A sales quota can often make you so motivated to close a sale that
you’re powerless to negotiate with the buyer. Buyers are often well aware of
sales quotas and can use them to negotiate a more attractive price and terms.
Try to think of different goals, such as acquiring a certain number of new cus-
tomers or increasing the number of cold calls you make by a certain percentage.
Plotting your course
The best laid plans of mice and men may often fail, but trying to achieve a
goal without having a solid plan in place is pure folly. Plot your course from
point A to point B, so you know where you are, where you’re going, and how
you’re going to get there before you even take that first step:
1. Determine where you are first. By logging your point of departure you
can more effectively measure your progress later.
2. Set your goal or destination, as described in the previous section.
13
Chapter 1: Boosting Sales with Advanced Sales Strategies

3. Include a timeframe to keep yourself on track.
4. Identify your objectives. Objectives are like milestone markers, reward-
ing you when you complete each leg of the journey.
5. Plan an overall strategy for achieving success. What sort of tactical
plan can ensure success with the least amount of effort?
6. Identify tasks. Break the process down into individual tasks to make the
plan feel less overwhelming and more manageable.
7. Identify the resources you have on hand, including personnel and
equipment.
Don’t get hung up thinking that you have to do everything yourself. Identify
the tasks you are well-qualified to perform and then delegate the remaining
tasks to more capable people who have more time. A good rule of thumb for
hiring people is this: If you earn more than enough per hour to cover the cost
of hiring someone else to do the work, hire someone. Also, if you can do
more and sell more with an assistant than you can without one, hire the
assistant. At least try it. See Chapter 13 for more about hiring the right
people to fill the gaps.
Implementing your plan
Sales and business consultants often discover that clients are more than will-
ing to pay them $300 or more per hour for advice and then rarely put that
advice into practice. They know what they have to do to achieve success, but
they’re unwilling to take that essential next step — implementing the plan.
After setting your goal and drawing up a solid plan, put your plan into action. If
it doesn’t quite work, make the necessary adjustments and try again. Successful
businesspeople rarely succeed on their first attempt. They fail, learn, make
adjustments, and persist. Unsuccessful people fail and give up or never even get
started. I’ve known salespeople who have stuck with a prospect for 14 months
and then given up only to discover that the customer decided to buy in the 15th
month. If it were easy, everyone would do it.
Weaving Advanced Selling into Your Life
Watch the top performers in any profession and you observe a quality that
they all share — almost every single one of them loves what they do. Even if
they weren’t getting paid to do what they do, they’d probably still be doing it.
My co-author, Joe, spent some time with the folks at Incredible Technologies,
creators of the most popular coin-op video game on the planet — Golden Tee
Golf. He interviewed the game testers — the quality control people who
14
Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 

tested the video games 8–12 hours a day. One of the questions he asked was,
“What do you guys do when you get home at night?” Their answer, “We play
video games.”
To become a top salesperson, you have to love selling, and then you have to
live it, as I explain in the following sections.
Don’t let success drive you to failure. If you’re a top salesperson, you will
eventually be asked to be the sales manager. I highly recommend that you
pass on this “promotion.” Managing salespeople is no job for a top sales-
person. It’s downright toxic. Not only would you find it frustrating, but you
would probably end up driving the other salespeople right out the door. If
you own your own business, avoid promoting your top salesperson to man-
ager for the same reasons.
Envisioning your success
What does sales success look like to you? Are you sitting in an office all day
making cold calls? Driving around from one disinterested client to another
trying to drum up business? Or do you have people calling you to place
orders? Do you have to hire an assistant to handle the extra business? Do you
have more opportunities than you can possibly pursue?
Your first step in achieving success is to envision it. Most people can’t get
past this first step, because they don’t even know what they would love to
do. Dream, and then jot down a detailed description of that dream, so you
can close your eyes and see it playing out in your mind.
Prior to May 6, 1954, the date on which Roger Bannister ran a mile in under 4
minutes, people thought that running a 4-minute mile was physically impossi-
ble. As soon as Bannister did it, other runners were miraculously able to run
4-minute miles. Why could they do it now when they couldn’t before?
Because now they could see themselves doing it.
Walking the walk
You can talk the talk. You know what you should be doing to achieve the suc-
cess you desire. The next step is to walk the walk. For salespeople, walking
the walk consists of doing the following:
 Practicing your craft. Practice selling at work, at home, at the airport, in
the taxi, at the grocery store, and wherever else you happen to be in
contact with other people. The key to selling is being able to establish
personal relationships with your clients. Practice by making meaningful
connections with everyone you meet.
15
Chapter 1: Boosting Sales with Advanced Sales Strategies

 Taking risks to stretch your limits. The people who make the most
money take the biggest risks, and that applies to sales as much as it
applies to anything in the world of business. You have to be willing to
invest money and take some chances. Otherwise, you’re little more than
an hourly employee hired to take orders.
 Embracing change as a growth strategy. The Internet, new technolo-
gies, and the global economy have combined forces to accelerate
change to a dizzying pace. The only way to survive and thrive in this
environment is to embrace rather than resist change. 
 Investing in your own success. As an entrepreneurial salesperson, you
have to act like a business, and that means investing in your own growth
and development, the latest gadgets to boost sales and productivity, and
support personnel, so you have more time to spend on what you do best
and what earns your company the biggest profits. Besides, walking
around with the latest gadgets is cool. Sometimes, I forget to pack one of
my gadgets just so I have an excuse to buy the latest version.
 Playing with new technologies. Tech savvy customers are relying more
on the Internet for their information and are using a variety of communi-
cations technologies to keep in touch, including cell phones, e-mail, text
messaging, VoIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol or Internet phones), and
blogs. To stay in touch with the latest generation of shoppers, you’d
better be tech savvy, too. 
 Hiring an assistant. Hire or be hired is what I say. Hire people to take on
tasks that they can perform better, faster, and cheaper than you can, and
then treat them well. The more work you can outsource to others, the
more time and energy you can spend on dollar-intensive activities. See
the following section, “Recruiting People Power to Fuel Your Success,”
for details.
 Achieving a balanced lifestyle. Being a successful human being means
much more than achieving career success. It means remaining healthy,
building rewarding relationships, supporting your community, and per-
haps even raising children. Failing in one area of your life can lead to fail-
ures in other areas. 
 Giving without expectations. Sales coaches often recommend that you
“give to get.” I’m telling you to “give to give.” If you’re expecting some-
thing in return, you’re not really giving — you’re bartering. Give for the
sheer pleasure of giving.
Work on being successful in all areas of your life. Without the strong relation-
ship I have with my wife and children, I would not have achieved the same
level of success in my career. Success feeds on success, and, unfortunately,
failure feeds on failure. Encourage everyone around you to set goals and
pursue their dreams.

Recruiting People Power 
to Fuel Your Success
Overachievers are often self-reliant types who refuse to ask for any assis-
tance. They like to achieve everything on their own, so they can take full
credit. When you’re in sales, that approach is nonsense. The fact is that you
can do more and do it better by harnessing the power of people.
If you need proof, just look around at the major corporations. Do you think
they could be major corporations without hiring people? Think of yourself as a
mini-corporation, You, Inc. When you want to grow your business, you’d better
hang out the Help Wanted sign and start interviewing some qualified candi-
dates. Here are some tips for harnessing people power to fuel your success: 
 Identify the missing links to your success. What do you want to do that
you can’t do because you are lacking the time or expertise? As soon as
you know what you need and don’t have in terms of talent, skill, and
time, you have a pretty good idea of the people you need to hire or part-
ner with — people who have what you need.

Chapter 1: Boosting Sales with Advanced Sales Strategies
Stay the course
During my recent stay at the Hilton Hotel in
Glendale, I met a young man, a bartender who
seemed a little down in the dumps. I had to
ask—the best salespeople always ask ques-
tions, the right questions. I asked what was
going on in his life, and he started talking right
away—the best bartenders always do. 
He had been engaged, and his fiancé had
recently called off the engagement. He wanted
to be a full-time fireman, and she wasn’t so sure
she wanted to be included in the pursuit of that
dream. Now he was deep in debt, having bor-
rowed to pay for a fancy engagement ring.
I advised him to continue to work, live at home,
pay off his jewelry debt, and do everything 
possible to keep moving forward toward his
goal of joining the fire department. People in
these situations often give up and settle for
something short of their dreams, and I hate to
see young people snuff out their dreams in the
prime of their lives.
Fortunately, he loves peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches, which will certainly help him meet
his budget, conserving funds to pay off debt and
stay focused on providing a great service to his
community. I wish him well.
If the path to your dreams seems a little rocky,
don’t give up and settle for less. Stay the course.

 Outsource time-consuming chores. Figure out how much you earn per
hour. If you earn $50 an hour selling and you’re cleaning your house over
the weekend when you can hire someone for $10 an hour to do it, that’s
borderline insane . . . unless, of course, cleaning your house is therapeu-
tic or something you enjoy doing. Hire someone so you have more time
to implement the strategies I present throughout this book. 
 Get yourself an intern. Colleges and even some high schools have
internships or coop programs in which students are willing to work for
free or for a pittance in exchange for job experience. Look into these
programs for some cheap and often highly qualified workers.
 Hire the talent you’re missing. Salespeople rarely hesitate to invest in a
gadget or service they think they need, but when I recommend that they
hire an assistant, they immediately find all sorts of excuses. The fact is
that hiring an assistant has never been easier. You can even hire a virtual
assistant, as explained in Chapter 13, so you don’t have to deal with
messy payroll issues and benefits. A virtual assistant works as a free-
lancer for however long you need the assistant’s skills.
 Cash in on R-Commerce (Relationship-Commerce). On its surface, the
economy is driven by the exchange of goods and services, but beneath
this surface economy is the real economy, driven by relationships. By
focusing on your relationships with customers, colleagues, and even
your competitors, you can grow your sales infinitely more than by focus-
ing simply on the exchange of goods and services. See Chapter 14 for
details.
 Team up with a personal partner. It’s far too easy to skip out on your
responsibilities when you’re accountable only to yourself. By teaming up
with a personal partner to set goals and keep one another on track, you
can achieve much higher levels of success than by acting alone. In
Chapter 7, I show you how to choose a personal partner and work
together to ensure mutual success.
 Pick the brain of a mentor or coach. Success leaves big footprints, so
follow those footprints by taking on a mentor or hiring a sales coach to
advise you. A mentor or coach can often point out shortcuts you may
have missed, expose you to incredible opportunities, and make sure
you’re doing everything you need to do to stay on plan.
 Become a mentor. You may think that mentoring a student or a sales-
person who’s less qualified, less experienced, or less successful than
you would be a huge expenditure of time, and perhaps it is, but what
you get in return usually makes up for it. A younger student can often
teach you a thing or two about using the latest technologies or expose
you to new marketing and sales techniques. In addition, if you establish
a solid relationship, your student promises to become a major network-
ing asset later in his career.

Selling Yourself: Self-Promotion
Sure, you’re selling products and services, but when your customers choose
to buy from you rather than from one of your competitors, they’re buying
into you. Although you may market and sell a host of products, remember
that your major marketing campaign should center mainly on you. You are
your own company, and by promoting yourself properly and persistently, you
ensure a long and successful future in sales.
People generally buy from people they know and trust. That’s why even
though shoppers may be able to go on the Internet and buy something for
considerably less than the street price, they often choose to shop at the local
store — a brick-and-mortar establishment. Your reputation should be so solid
that you essentially become a brick-and-mortar establishment unto yourself.
By shamelessly promoting yourself, you create the image — the impression —
you want people to have of you. Cold calls become warm calls, because people
already feel as though they know you. Do it right, and you won’t even have to
call . . . people who want what you’re selling are going to call you.
To engage in effective shameless self promotion, you first have to find some-
thing in yourself to promote, and then promote it, as explained in the follow-
ing sections.
Identifying your unique selling point
In the good old days, you knew who you were doing business with. Maybe it
was Ted the TV guy, Melvin the milkman, Beatrice the beautician, Clare the
cleaning lady, Fran the financial planner, or Ralph the Realtor (always think-
ing of Me, Incorporated). In a small town there was usually one person known
as the go-to guy or gal for each product or service. Nowadays, particularly in
big cities, you may find dozens or even thousands of suppliers from which to
choose. To stick out (in a good way, of course), you want to pick something
about you that’s unique or create some memorable persona, so when
prospective customers think of the product or service you’re selling, they
immediately think of you.
Several years ago, I decided to make an 11-foot-tall, 500-pound nail my unique
thing. You can skip to Chapter 9 to find out more about it or visit
www.BigNail.com. I purchased the Big Nail on eBay, stuck it on a trailer,
and pulled it around town to various fundraising events for special causes. I
also placed the Big Nail logo on all my marketing materials. Needless to say, it
created a lot of positive buzz.
19
Chapter 1: Boosting Sales with Advanced Sales Strategies

Discover your Big Nail and make it the center of your self-promotional cam-
paign. A clear, central focus on something that can really get you pumped up
can generate a lot of energy and, more importantly, draw a lot of attention.
Branding yourself
Think of Martha Stewart, The Donald, Oprah, Britney Spears, Paris Hilton. As
soon as you see or hear the name, that person’s face probably pops into your
mind. And you probably can describe what each person does. That’s because
these people have brand presence. Through their own self promotion and a
lot of help from the media, these folks have achieved celebrity status.
While you may not crave celebrity status or want the paparazzi photograph-
ing you while you’re on vacation, you can achieve a certain level of brand
presence on your own by creating your own buzz-marketing blitz:
 Market yourself on paper. Start slow with your own business cards and
brochures. Hand them out to everyone you know and everyone you meet.
 Market yourself in the media. Are you an expert on what you sell? You
should be. Leverage your expertise in your marketing efforts. Offer to
write articles for local newspapers and magazines. Call the local TV and
radio stations and offer your services as a local expert for news stories
related to your area of expertise. Offer to speak to local groups for free. I
gave more than 1,000 free speeches before I ever was able to charge a fee.
 Market yourself on the Internet. Every salesperson should have at least
one Web site or blog. I have over 200, including AboutRalph.com (profes-
sional services site), BigNail.com (about branding), GetFlipping.com
(to promote Flipping Houses For Dummies), FlippingFrenzy.com
(about real estate and mortgage fraud), RalphRoberts.com (a real
estate site), and KolleenRoberts.com (a tribute to my older daughter).
The Internet is an entirely separate world, a virtual world, where more
and more people are spending more and more of their time. You have to
be there to meet and greet these tech savvy customers.
 Advertise everywhere. Wherever people who buy the products and 
services you sell happen to hang out or obtain their information, you
should be there. If your customers watch TV, you should be on TV. If
they tune into the radio, they should be able to hear your voice occa-
sionally. If they read the papers, you should have an ad in the paper.
I put my phone number and e-mail address on everything. That makes some
salespeople a little nervous, because they don’t want everyone calling them
at all hours of the day and night. I have assistants who handle much of the
added work, and I strongly recommend that you do the same. Yes, having to
field calls, answer questions, talk with reporters, write articles, and do all
that other self-promotional stuff requires more time, energy, and effort, but if
you want to be the top salesperson in your industry, that’s what it takes.
20
Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 

Prospecting for Ideas and Leads
The paradox of giving is that the more you give, the more you receive, espe-
cially when you’re not trying to receive. It just snowballs. One opportunity
leads to another. I post an article on one of my blogs, and a reporter calls to
interview me. That interview gets posted, a publisher notices it and calls me
to write a book. The book is published, and I get more reporters calling.
Sometimes, I attend a conference for the sole purpose of attending a few
workshops and honing my sales skills. The workshops can all be terrible, but
I always manage to bump into someone, start conversing, and we come up
with an idea for a new business venture or product. 
These opportunities arise through no real conscious effort to pursue a partic-
ular opportunity. However, they wouldn’t happen if I wasn’t proactive in mar-
keting myself and maintaining productive relationships. To open yourself to
more leads and opportunities, I recommend you do the following:
 Hand out your business card to everyone you know and meet.
 Post an article at least once a week on your Web site or blog.
 Contribute to online discussions on message boards and blogs that pertain
to your products and services — get involved in these online communities.
 Remain positive and upbeat. Nobody likes a wet blanket. You should
also consider steering clear of discussions about politics, religion, sex,
and schools.
 Become a member, preferably a leader, in your trade association.
 Attend conferences regularly, and offer to speak or deliver workshops
on your areas of expertise.
 Keep in touch with everyone in your address book, preferably by way of
personal phone calls. 
 Talk to reporters — they can get the word out for you.
 Volunteer for an organization you trust, but avoid committees. Most
salespeople are very civic minded, but a committee can really sap your
enthusiasm.
Unlocking the Secret of Mutual Success
Selling is all about establishing mutually beneficial relationships, and when
you think about it, that’s the type of relationship we strive for in every aspect
of our lives. The most productive relationships are those in which each
person involved thrives independently and can bring something of value to
the relationship.
21
Chapter 1: Boosting Sales with Advanced Sales Strategies

In business, particularly in sales, making everyone around you successful
delivers several things of value:
 Return business: Satisfied customers are more likely to come back to
you the next time they’re in the market for your product or service . . .
assuming they think of you, which is why it is so important to keep in
touch with customers.
 Increased sales volume: A successful business customer is more profitable
and has the money to purchase more products and services from you.
 Positive referrals: When customers are happy, particularly if you had
something to do with it, they’re more likely to refer you to other people
they know.
 Positive testimonials: Testimonials are great to include in sales letters,
brochures, and other marketing materials. If future prospects know that
you’ve helped others, they have more trust that you can help them.
 Increased opportunities: Focusing on your customer’s success often
opens your mind to new ideas for additional products and services and
perhaps even new divisions or businesses you can start.
In the following sections, I offer some suggestions on how to ensure your own
success by making everyone around you more successful.
Making your customers successful
Your customer’s success is your success, so it is in your best interest to make
your customer as successful as possible. That doesn’t mean giving away your
products and services. It does mean enabling your customer to tap the full
potential of what you’re selling and to assist your customer even when that
assistance doesn’t directly boost sales. 
You may be called on to offer your customer some free advice, refer them to
other companies for products and services you don’t sell, or even do a little
head-hunting for them to steer them in the direction of the most qualified
personnel in your area.
Become your own customer, as much as possible. Try to buy the same prod-
uct or one that’s similar to what you sell from another salesperson to dis-
cover insights from your customer’s point of view. (You don’t actually have to
buy it.) See Chapter 18 for additional strategies and tips for establishing
mutually beneficial relationships with your customers.  
22
Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 

Making your customers’ 
customers successful
As an entrepreneurial salesperson, always think one step ahead — that
means considering your customer’s customer. The single most important
contribution you can make to your customer’s success is contributing to the
success of your customer’s customer. 
In many cases, this is primarily the responsibility of your company’s CEO or
product development division, but because you probably have more direct
contact with customers, you may need to carry the message back to your
company. If you’re selling to a business that sells your product to consumers,
keep that consumer, the end user, in mind.
Focusing your efforts on 
underserved clientele
Your market is likely populated with a portion of un-served or underserved
clientele, particularly minority customers that you and your competitors
have ignored. Ensuring customer success often calls for paying some atten-
tion to this market sector.
Chapter 19 offers specific suggestions for appealing to minority, multicultural
clientele. Salespeople who are able to implement some of the strategies dis-
cussed in this chapter often reap incredible rewards because they find that
they have no competition for these customers. By making a few adjustments,
you can corner the market and expand your world view at the same time.
Declaring peace with your competitors
Establish relationships with your competitors like the relationships you have
when you compete against friends in a friendly game of tennis. Try your best
to pummel the competition, but don’t take it personally. You never know
when you may need to ask one of your sworn enemies for a favor or when an
opportunity to work together may present itself.
In Chapter 20, I point out several potential benefits of playing nice with the
competition and show you how to collaborate effectively when given the
opportunity. I also show you ways in which you can cut in on your competi-
tor’s profits . . . nicely, of course.
23
Chapter 1: Boosting Sales with Advanced Sales Strategies

Declaring peace with your competitors doesn’t mean waving the white flag.
It’s about playing fair, and I don’t mean county-fair nice. You’re still a gladia-
tor fighting for your life in the great arena of life, so don’t go soft. Just keep in
mind that your competitors can come in handy at times.
Tapping the power of professional 
associations
As you’re making the rounds to boost the performance and productivity of
everyone around you, don’t overlook your colleagues. Join and lead your trade
association, and give back to the industry that toasts and butters your bread. 
Honor your duty to give back to your industry. Once a year, you should offer
to speak at an industry event or at least act as a member of a discussion
panel. Find a way to give back and pass along the wisdom you’ve acquired.
In Chapter 14, I point out the many benefits of being a member of your trade
association and the bigger benefits of taking on a leadership position. By
making your colleagues more successful, you do your part to create a
healthy, thriving industry that’s good for everyone — suppliers, salespeople,
clients, consumers, and yourself. In addition, you gain professional contacts,
many of whom are leaders in the industry.

Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 
Why share your secrets?
Whenever I speak, coach, or publish a book
revealing my “secrets” of success, people often
wonder why I would share these secrets. Why
not just keep all of this to myself? Why risk
revealing anything of value to the competition?
Someone asked Ira Hayes, the top salesperson
at NCR (National Cash Register) many years
ago, these same questions. At the time, Hayes
was touring the country, telling everyone his
secrets to achieving phenomenal sales. When
someone asked why he would come and speak
to the sales people at a company that was one
of NCR’s major competitors, Hayes said some-
thing like, “Well, nobody at my company is fol-
lowing my advice, so I don’t expect that any of
you will follow it either.”
I carefully screen candidates before I agree to
coach or mentor them for this very reason — I
can’t teach someone who won’t put my advice
into practice. 

Chapter 2
Visualizing Yourself 
as a Power Seller
In This Chapter
 Selecting top-notch role models
 Crowding out negative thoughts with positive statements
 Getting comfortable with yourself
 Defining what you mean by “success” 
 Visualizing your future success
P
ower selling is about faith, and faith is a funny thing. While most people
believe it when they see it, people with faith see it because they believe
it. The “power” in power selling comes from believing — believing in the
product or service you’re selling, in your customers or clients, in your per-
sonnel, and especially in yourself.
The first step to becoming a power seller, is to believe in yourself. Visualize
yourself as a success, and you’re a big step closer to becoming a success. In
this chapter, I show you how to establish a power-selling mindset by identify-
ing your sales role models, packing your brain with positive thoughts, and
envisioning your future success. By following the advice I offer in this chap-
ter, you can gain the belief that empowers you to achieve your dreams.
Sidling Up to Top Sellers
To be good at anything, hang out with the people who are the best. To be a
good father, be around good fathers. To be a good friend, hang out with the
people who are good friends and work toward being a good friend to them.
To be a good salesperson, rub elbows with the top salespeople. By surround-
ing yourself with the best, you benefit in at least two ways: 
Those people motivate you to strive for excellence. 
They model the skills you need to achieve your desired level of excellence.

As Charlie “Tremendous” Jones use to say, “You’re only as good as the books
you read, the people you meet, and the tapes you listen to.” And in the sec-
tions that follow, I give you the tools you need to both find and follow the
best people who can inspire you to success.
Identifying your sales heroes
To figure out how to envision yourself as anything, watch a kid. Kids have
heroes — maybe their favorite baseball or soccer player, an astronaut or
movie character, a teacher or parent, or perhaps even a superhero like
Wonder Woman or Spiderman. Kids who really get into it pretend to be the
hero. They talk the talk, walk the walk, and for some fleeting moment during
the day, they become that hero, at least in their own minds.
Of course, the heroes you need aren’t likely to be wielding their powers on
the silver screen or hitting homeruns — you need heroes that can help you
envision yourself as a sales success. Throughout these sections I show you
how to figure out just what makes a good sales hero as well as how to start
your own growing list of heroes.
My sales heroes
I’ve gathered a my own list of sales heroes to
share with you. These are people who, through
their words and examples, have inspired and
guided me to my current success:
 Julia Rowland, my grandmother and owner
of Fashion Treasure Jewelry — an accom-
plished saleswoman who embodied the joy
of selling — inspired me to go for the gold
when it came to selling on my own.
 Tony & Noel Fox of Fox Brothers Real Estate
— the first real estate brokers, who hired
me right out of high school and taught me
the nuts and bolts of introducing myself to
everyone and letting them know who I was
and what I did. When I first started, they
dropped me off at the local grocery store
and told me to introduce myself to everyone
and give them my card. For Tony and Noel,
the weather was no excuse not to work.
When it rained, I was in the grocery store;
when it was nice I was on the door-to-door
campaign. As a salesperson there is always
something you can do!
 Ira Hayes, the original Ambassador of
Enthusiasm, who taught me the power of
the word “Great!” Hayes was a top sales-
man for NCR (National Cash Register) who
led not only with words but also by exam-
ple. I attended every one of his speaking
events I could and wore out his tapes lis-
tening to them. 
 Tom Hopkins, author of Selling For Dummies
and the guy who wrote the first book of tips
for real estate agents. Every top sales-
person I know follows the Tom Hopkins
approach to selling . . even if they don’t
know it’s his approach. On Jan 23, 1986, I
took his course on Closing the Sale for the
’80s. He taught me the value of goals and
the characteristics of a great salesman. 

27
Chapter 2: Visualizing Yourself as a Power Seller 
 Zig Ziglar, the sales superhero, who taught
me that if you help enough people get what
they want, you will get what you want. 
 Charlie “Tremendous” Jones, who revealed
to me the life-changing power of people
and books.
 Art Fettig, who taught me the difference
between a great salesperson and an order
taker.
 Joe Girard, the top car salesman of all
times, who happened to sell cars four miles
from where I grew up. Over the years we
would meet and have lunch. I soaked up
everything I could to learn how to be the
best salesman possible. Joe taught me that
you could have a team and be more suc-
cessful together.
 Floyd Wickman, a real estate agent in my
area, who taught me to stay on track and be
competent, confident, and natural. The
same houses that Wickman sold for
$17,000–$20,000 30 years ago, I now sell for
$175,000–300,000! The National Association
of Realtors commissioned Floyd, Danielle
Kennedy, and me to go out to real estate
offices across the country to critique offices
and teams. 
 Dick Runstatler, my favorite sales manager
of all time, who let Ralph be Ralph and taught
me how to handle stressful situations. 
 Tom Desmond, a real estate agent I worked
with at Earl Kiem real estate, who was con-
stantly striving to improve himself. At the
time, I thought his obsession with profes-
sional titles was silly. Only later did I realize
that he was truly dedicated to being the
best he could be.
 Earl Keim, a guy who could sell you the
house next door, even if you didn’t want it.
He coined the phrase “Keim Sold Mine,”
expanded his brokerage to include hun-
dreds of offices, and later became a
speaker who passed along his words of
wisdom known as “Earl’s pearls.” He taught
me the value of branding.
 Lee Iacocca, who sold the government on
bailing out the Chrysler Corporation with
$1.2 billion. What I admire most about
Iacocca is how he reacted during the
Chrysler crisis — pulling an idea way out of
the box to bail out the automotive company.
No one would have expected that his crazy
idea would be seriously considered, but he
didn’t let that stop him and he got it done —
it was a good thing and the right thing to do.
 Norman Vincent Peale, best-selling author
of The Power of Positive Thinking, who rec-
ognized the extraordinary in ordinary
people and sincerely cared about other
people. He saw opportunity and seized it. 
 Mark Victor Hansen, the “Master of
Mindset” and co-creator of Chicken Soup
for the Soul, who taught me to reflect rejec-
tion and continue to pursue my passion.
Mark was instrumental in helping me
launch my writing career. 
 Og Mandino (www.ogmandino.com), a
humble, yet remarkable man who spent so
much of his life striving to overcome his
own personal challenges and sharing what
he discovered through his writing and
teaching. His legacy is a gift to us all. 
 Tom Antion, the speaker’s speaker, who
taught me that if you can’t talk to people,
you can’t sell.
 Les Brown, who taught me the power of
living with a purpose.

Honing in on hero qualities
To simplify the process of envisioning yourself as a successful salesperson,
identify your sales heroes — people whom you deem the ultimate salespeople.
You’re unique, of course, so you won’t sell exactly the same way they do or
even have the same personal or professional goals, but picking the right role
models means you get:
 Valuable resources for continuing education: Your role model has
probably read all the books, listened to the tapes, attended a host of
seminars, consulted with hundreds of other salespeople in your field,
and field-tested a variety of sales techniques. This person is uniquely
qualified to provide you with shortcuts to success by showing you what
works and what doesn’t and pointing the way to other useful resources. 
 Inspiration to strive for higher levels of success: When you hook up
with a sales hero, you make a commitment to that person (often unspo-
ken) to do your best. Just by having an accomplished salesperson guid-
ing you, you work a little harder, knowing that your hero is watching and
rooting for you.
 Shortcuts to success: Your sales heroes probably achieved success
through a good deal of trial and error. They know what works and what
doesn’t. By listening to them, you can avoid much of the trial and error
and pour more energy into acquiring techniques that really work. 
Success leaves behind huge footprints. Follow those footprints to the person
who left them and try to connect with that person. The most successful people
are typically the most generous with their time and expertise. They’re willing to
share if you demonstrate an eagerness to learn. (See Chapter 14 for details
about teaming up with others to build mutually beneficial relationships.)
Pinpointing the best people
Start a list of your own personal and professional heroes. They can be
authors, speakers, colleagues, family members, friends, or neighbors. Anyone
you admire is a perfect candidate to be a hero.
Role models can be from the past or present, near or far, in sales or out of
sales, but they must be successful at what they do. If you haven’t yet identi-
fied one or more role models, start looking:
 Identify the top sales person where you work and consider using that
person as your role model.
 Check out other books by salespeople with proven track records includ-
ing Selling For Dummies, by Tom Hopkins.
 Attend conferences where the top salespeople offer motivational presen-
tations and sales seminars.
28
Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 

 Get involved in your trade association, as discussed in Chapter 16.
 Read biographies of historical figures you admire or are curious about.
 Ask people you admire who their role models are.
Shadowing top sellers
You can certainly start to form an idea of the salesperson you want to be by
studying your sales heroes, attending their seminars, reading their books, lis-
tening to their tapes, and perhaps even meeting them in person. The best
way to envision yourself selling the way they sell, however, is to observe
them in action. Shadow superior salespeople and watch them ply their craft
on the job.
I’ve had dozens of salespeople spend a day with me, simply observing what I
do. I shadow other salespeople to pick up new strategies and tips from them.
To remain on the cutting edge is a lifelong learning process, and shadowing is
often the best training available.
Set a goal to shadow at least one other salesperson this month. If you work in
an office with other salespeople, ask your manager to schedule a day when
you can shadow the top salesperson in the company. In Chapter 8, I recom-
mend personal partnering as another way to team up with colleagues to boost
sales and improve your career.

Chapter 2: Visualizing Yourself as a Power Seller 
The World’s Greatest Salesman
I was fortunate enough to grow up in
Metropolitan Detroit, where I had some incred-
ible role models, including Joe Girard, the
“World’s Greatest Salesperson.” Joe Girard has
been listed in the Guinness Book of World
Records as the Number 1 Retail Sales Person in
the World for 12 years. In his 15 years as a new
car salesman, Joe sold 13,001 cars (all retail
sales, no fleet, wholesale, or used cars).
Joe believed that “sparks create fires,” and he
was constantly on the lookout for sparks he
could use to motivate himself to make some-
thing happen. Joe started gathering sparks at
an early age, growing up in one of Detroit’s
worst ghettos with a father who constantly
berated him and told him that he would never
amount to anything. Joe’s first spark was his
determination to prove that his father had been
wrong. His second spark was to show his
mother that her love for him and her faith in him
had not been misplaced. 
I was very fortunate to live in the same town as
Joe Girard. Over the years, I would have lunch
with him, and he served as my unofficial mentor.
I listened to Joe, read stories about him, and
visualized myself being a top salesperson, like
Joe Girard. By modeling myself after a sales-
person I admired, I was able to take a shortcut.
I didn’t have to discover strategies and tips,
because Joe shared with me what he had
already discovered.

If you’re on a sales team in which each salesperson handles a different geo-
graphical area, making shadowing impractical, set aside a couple hours
during a late Friday afternoon to share anecdotes, war stories, and situational
analysis with the top or veteran sales people on your team. Do this regularly
and you’ll be amazed at the sharp reduction in the number of sales situations
that catch you by surprise. In addition to benefiting from your own experi-
ence, you benefit from the experience of your fellow teammates. Harnessing
the Power of Positive Thinking
I hate complainers; they always have excuses for why they’re not successful.
They’re not getting quality leads.
The sales quotas are too high.
The company doesn’t provide enough support for the sales department.
The product or service is second rate.
The business is facing too much competition. 
Blah, blah, blah.
Power sellers don’t look for excuses. They have a can-do attitude that enables
them to overcome any limitation. In the following sections, I show you how to
develop this can-do attitude and crowd out counterproductive thoughts.
Death and incurable illness are the only two problems you can’t solve. Every
other problem in the world can be solved with time, money, human
resources, or a combination of the three. Don’t let problems get in the way of
your success — solve them!
Revving up your mind with affirmations
Most of us grow up learning to put ourselves down for any real or imagined
shortcoming. We grow up believing certain things about ourselves or com-
paring ourselves negatively to others. The use of positive affirmations is a
technique to change that negative self-talk into something more positive. But
even if you’re one of the fortunate few not experience the negative self-talk,
affirmations still can be a powerful ally in reaching your goals.
Affirmations are effective because they can fundamentally change a person’s
subconscious thought patterns. In the past few years the researchers have
proven some very astounding facts that once were only theories, the most
important of which (for our purposes) is that the subconscious mind is the
true power center. It controls 97 percent of our actions, beliefs, behaviors,
and attitudes.
In the following sections, my friend and colleague Dave Bouffard (a.k.a. Mr.
Positive at www.MrPositive.com) and I bring you up to speed on the power of
30

affirmations and show you how to use them to fuel a positive attitude that
drives success from your subconscious mind throughout all aspects of your life.
An attitude of gratitude is absolutely essential in the practice of affirmations.
Be thankful for everything you have.
Grasping affirmation basics
An affirmation is not simply a memo telling yourself what to think or how to
behave. An affirmation must paint a picture or project an image in your mind
and make an emotional connection. You must go beyond thinking the affirma-
tion to feeling it. Otherwise, they simply have little or no effect on your long-
term attitude and behaviors.
Below are a few basic affirmations that most people know and many have
tried and may or may not have had success with:
“All I need is within me now.” 
“I love and accept myself exactly as I am.” 
“Money comes to me easily and effortlessly.” (Replace “Money” with
whatever you desire.)
“I am healthy in body, mind, and spirit.” 
“I am living my wonderful, ideal life.”
“Every day in every way I am getting better and better!”
These basic affirmations are not bad, but they obviously don’t evoke an emo-
tional response and they’re certainly not something we would consider suffi-
cient for advanced selling.
Research has discovered that every negative thought requires 27 positive
thoughts to cancel it out. 
Composing your own advanced affirmations
Average affirmations are fine for average people, but when you’re trying to
take your sales career to the next level, average just isn’t good enough. You
want the deluxe models. So what separates an average affirmation from
something more advanced? Advanced affirmations must meet the following
four requirements:
 Stated in the present tense: Word the affirmation to express your own-
ership of it and convey the sense that you have already achieved what 
it states. All affirmation should begin with words like “I am . . .” or 
“I have . . .”. For example, instead of saying, “I will have a rewarding job,”
say, “I have a rewarding job.” Otherwise, you’ll be waiting forever for
that reward job to come your way.
31
Chapter 2: Visualizing Yourself as a Power Seller 

 Expresses a positive statement: Affirm what you want, rather than what
you don’t want. For example, instead of saying, “I am no longer sick,”
you may say, “I am now perfectly healthy in body, mind and spirit.” This
reinforces your desired goal without confusing your subconscious mind
with the mention of the undesirable condition.
 Is short and specific: Short affirmations are easy to say, and have a far
greater impact at the subconscious level than those that are long and
wordy. Keeping them short and specific to the point adds power as the
idea is uncluttered by extraneous elements.
 Is spoken with strong feeling: The more emotion and feeling you put
into your affirmations, the deeper the impression they leave on your
subconscious. Your goal when stating your affirmations should be to fire
up your passion so your can “see” your goal and create a strong emo-
tional connection.
Checking out some advanced affirmation examples
If you’re having trouble composing your own affirmations, you may find inspi-
ration in affirmations that other salespeople have written. Here are some
examples of advanced affirmations:
 I (state your name) easily attract everything I need for me to meet my sales
goals. Leads, referrals and the right opportunities always come to me.
 I (state your name) am a selling professional who always goes the extra
mile to serve my clients, exceeding their expectations and meeting their
goals, and I always meet or exceed my professional goals.
 I (state your name) am dedicated to my personal and professional devel-
opment. I read, listen to tapes, and attend training sessions to improve
my skills. I am a lifelong learner who easily absorbs and applies what I
learn to my life on a daily basis.
 I (state your name) take great care of my physical being. I exercise regu-
larly, eat healthy, and get sufficient rest. My health is my true wealth. I
am committed to my health and wealth! 
 I (state your name) am confident, charismatic, and attractive to the
people I meet in both my personal and professional life. I am a great lis-
tener and communicator.
Imprinting your affirmations into your subconscious
After you have composed the perfect affirmation for yourself, you can begin
the process of imprinting your affirmation in your subconscious mind. To do
an effective job of making your affirmation an integral part of your being,
follow these tips:
32
Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 

 Repeat your affirmation often: The importance of repetition cannot be
overemphasized. Your affirmation should become your mantra.
Although you may not want to chant, you should play it over and over in
your mind. 
 Express your affirmation emotionally: Get involved, be passionate,
move your body and feel it. Pretend that you already have what you are
affirming. How would you feel and act. The feeling is vital and brings
much more power to the process than just writing, typing, or speaking
your affirmations. 
 Be persistent and consistent: Continue to remind yourself of your com-
mitment to your affirmation and strive to attain it. If you get distracted
and wander off the path, recommit yourself to success.
 Believe: Ditch any doubts that may creep into your mind. You must will-
ingly suspend any disbelief, just like when you read a book or watch a
movie. Get into it. Don’t overanalyze it or let the destructive voices of
negative self-talk have a say in who you are. If you believe that the affir-
mation process will work for you, it will. 
 Personalize: Personalize all of your affirmations, by stating your name.
Your subconscious responds to your name (that’s why in a crowd when
someone speaks your name you hear it!). The more tools you use to
reach your subconscious mind, the more powerful the process of using
advanced affirmations is going to be for you, and the sooner you experi-
ence positive results.
Acquiring additional affirmation techniques
Many people who use affirmations to adjust their attitudes and drive their
success simply repeat their affirmations in their minds, crowding out the neg-
ative self-talk and replacing it with positive self-talk. However, you can use a
variety of techniques to imprint your affirmations on your mind. 
Use the combo pack approach: Write out your affirmations, record them in
your own voice, and use them when you exercise! Then read, listen, and say
them daily.
Following are several techniques that we use to reinforce our affirmations:
 Writing technique: Consider writing down each affirmation 10 to 20
times a day for 30 days or journaling about your affirmations. Writing is
a physical activity that can make the affirmation feel like a more integral
part of your being.
 Recorder technique: Speak your affirmations into a tape or digital
recorder and then listen to them first thing in the morning and just
before you drift off to sleep at night. Your subconscious mind often pays
better attention to your own voice.
33
Chapter 2: Visualizing Yourself as a Power Seller 

Mix in your favorite music or natural sounds — anything that brings you
into a positive emotional state and makes your mind more receptive to
the message.
 Exercise technique: As you’re working out, repeat your affirmations.
You can say them out loud or in your head. This technique is especially
effective if your affirmations have to do with health. You may say some-
thing like “Everyday in every way I’m getting better and better” or “I am
strong, I feel great, I am healthy, I am healthy.” 
 Mirror affirmation technique: Stand in front of the mirror, look in your
eyes, and speak your affirmations to yourself. The key is looking into
your eyes and speaking out loud just as though you were closing a deal
with a prospect. You are selling yourself your affirmation, so keep eye
contact, stand tall, and put on your best smile, because this is the most
important sales call you’ll ever have!
Most people go through life looking others in the eyes to show they are
being sincere and honest, but most people never truly look themselves
in the eye! Try it. It’s very, very powerful.  
 Anywhere technique: Whenever you find yourself with a free moment,
repeat your affirmations, in your car, in the elevator, at your desk. And if
you have a negative thought or say something negative about yourself,
immediately restate it in the positive.
 Meditation technique: If you enjoy meditation, simply add the repetition
of your affirmations to your practice. 
 Trash can technique: Whenever you find something in your life that
isn’t working or you don’t like, write it down and throw it into the trash.
By doing this, you are telling yourself, I want to be done with this prob-
lem, and then . . . be done with it.
 The burning bowl technique: The “burning bowl” ceremony is a simple
process that works much like the trash can technique above. Write two
lists — one is for all the thoughts and personal traits that you want to
get rid of, and the other is for the positive thoughts and traits that fill
the vacuum created by the departing thoughts. Light a fire in a bowl
(outside on your BBQ or in your fireplace) and put the bad list in, and
state that you release these thoughts/traits to the universe. Then as the
flames continue to burn, read your new positive affirmations.
 Candle technique: Disconnect the phones and remove any other dis-
tractions. Sit in a quiet room, light a single candle, turn out the lights,
and close the shades. As the flame burns, stare at it and softly repeat
your positive affirmations out-loud. Continue repeating your affirmations
for 10 to 20 minutes.
34
Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 

 Integration technique: Affirmations alone are insufficient in achieving
your goals. They are the words and motivation required to trigger posi-
tive change and action, but real change and action are required to
enable those affirmations to manifest themselves in your life. The inte-
gration technique calls on you to put those affirmations into practice.
The rest is up to you, so get busy. Integrate congruent action with your
affirmations and you will increase the speed of your results.
The best time to reaffirm your affirmations are in the morning, just before
you get out of bed, while you are still in a semi-dreamy state, and at the end
of the day just before you drift off to sleep. Of course, the more you repeat
your affirmations throughout the day the better. 
Reminiscing on past successes
Negative, self-defeatist thoughts often result from a perceived failure in the
past — a perceived failure to achieve a goal that you set for yourself or that
someone else set for you. Maybe the goal was “getting A’s and B’s,” being hap-
pily married, having children, or being a successful doctor or lawyer. You
didn’t achieve whatever goal was set, so you may have some lingering doubts
about your abilities.
For this very reason, a colleague of mine, Lois Maljak, keeps a journal. She
calls it journaling the journey. Lois has written in her journals daily for over 25
years and has a complete chronicle of her life from the time she began writing
and collecting photos and clippings. To Lois, her journey through life is more
important than wherever she happens to end up. By looking back at her jour-
nal entries, Lois reminds herself of all of her wonderful accomplishments and
experiences — traveling with her parents when her father was in the service,
friendships she developed, family gatherings, raising her children, and so on.
When you notice that you’re beating yourself up over some sale that fell
through, a shortcoming you think you have, or an obstacle you think you
can’t overcome, jot down a list of what you’ve accomplished or at least think
back to what you consider to be the major accomplishments in your life.
Looking back reminds you that you managed to make it through overwhelm-
ingly tough times in the past and gives you the perspective, strength, and
encouragement to tackle today’s apparently monumental problems.
Although celebrating past success can empower you to deal better with cur-
rent challenges, don’t get stuck in neutral reminiscing about past successes
or trying to relive those moments. Your current reality is the present, and
you eventually have to deal with it. Reach back to the past to gather the
insight and strength you need to forge ahead and strive for even higher levels
of future success.

Chapter 2: Visualizing Yourself as a Power Seller 

Surrounding yourself with positive people
The world is full of optimists, pessimists, and people in between — those bal-
anced souls who comprise the majority of the population. The world needs a
little negativity. We need critics to set standards, sound the alarm when those
standards aren’t met, and point out problems. When you’re in sales, however,
critics can function as dream killers, especially if the criticism they offer is
not constructive.
I’m not suggesting that you surround yourself with a bunch of yes men and
women. I do suggest, however, that you gather around you people who believe
in you and avoid those who don’t. Surround yourself with people who will
stand shoulder to shoulder with you even in the most dire circumstances.
Check the roster and make sure you’ve packed it with positive teammates:
 Your spouse or life partner: My career really took off after I met my
wife, Kathleen. Kathleen believes in me, assists me in running our busi-
nesses, shares goals, and opens my mind to new opportunities. A posi-
tive attitude begins with your family and closest friends and confidants,
especially when you’re in business for yourself. 
 Other family members: Family members can be highly supportive cheer-
leaders or your most brutal critics. Because they know you so intimately,
they can dredge up incidents from the past or point out shortcomings that
nobody else is aware of. If a family member or certain family gatherings
get you down, limit your time around them or avoid them altogether.
When you’re in business for yourself, you can use all the family support
you can get, so try not to burn too many bridges.
 Coworkers: Positive coworkers naturally create a team-based atmos-
phere in which everyone joins forces to make each person achieve her
maximum potential. Put a stop to any negativity you feel from a
coworker, if possible. If it’s not possible, avoid the person like the plague.
 Supervisor: A good supervisor acts less like an overbearing boss and
more like a facilitator, communication hub, and mentor. If your super-
visor makes you feel like a loser, consider confronting the person, avoid-
ing her, or looking for another job.
Are you a positive support person? Do you demonstrate your belief in your
family members, colleagues, friends, and neighbors, or are you overly criti-
cal? You can’t expect to receive support unless you give it to others. Show
others that you believe in them, and you can immediately boost the attitude
and performance of everyone around you.

Waking up with a positive plan
The first 15 minutes of every morning, I spend planning my day. My co-
author, Joe, plans for tomorrow at the end of the day. He also leaves some-
thing unfinished at the end of the day, so he has something to get him going
the next day. 
However you choose to do it, have a positive plan in place first thing in the
morning. Draw up a to-do list, and then do it. A to-do list serves several 
purposes:
 Gives your day some structure, so you’re not waiting around for some-
thing to happen
 Provides you with mini-goals to motivate you
 Rewards you with a sense of accomplishment and a feeling that you’re
making progress
Although your to-do list shouldn’t be overwhelming, it should contain more
tasks than you can possibly accomplish in a single day. Any downtime you
have gives negative thoughts and too much opportunity to procrastinate and
destroy your momentum. For more about planning your day, week, month,
year, and life, check out Chapter 3.
How you manage your to-do list is less important than that you manage your
to-do list. You can jot down a list of tasks on a Post-It note and stick it to your
computer screen, carry the list around in your pocket, keep a day planner,
record your tasks in a program like Microsoft Outlook, or type them into your
PDA (personal digital assistant). Regardless of which method you choose to
record your to-do list, make sure you remain accountable to it until you’re
ready to make the next day’s list: Mark off tasks you’ve accomplished, make
notes about tasks in progress, and note which tasks need to be revised or
moved to another day.
Defining “Success” in Your Own Terms
Whenever I use the term success in this book, I’m usually talking about it in
terms of meeting a sales quota or achieving your own goal of increased sales
and revenue. Success, however, means whatever you decide it means for you.
I’ve seen highly successful people who were terrible in business, and I’ve
seen people who were highly successful in business but miserable failures in
their personal lives. You are as successful as you feel you are.
37
Chapter 2: Visualizing Yourself as a Power Seller 

Being healthy, wealthy, and wise, is very nearly impossible. When you
become ill, health becomes your primary concern. When you need money or
fulfilling work, your career becomes your focus. When you have problems in
your personal life, those problems draw your attention. 
To maintain some semblance of balance, I encourage you to develop a defini-
tion of success that fulfills all parts of your being:
 Head: Develop and challenge your mind by becoming a lifelong learner,
and connect with people from varied backgrounds who are likely to chal-
lenge your current thinking.
 Heart: Meaningful relationships are key to developing understanding
and empathy. Don’t let your career get in the way of relationships with
family, friends, neighbors, and even complete strangers.
 Hands: Hands represent action. Take action to improve the environment
around you — your physical surroundings, family, community, and so on.
 Soul: Spirituality is key to gaining the perspective that you’re a part of
something much greater and developing a sense of interconnectedness.
Envisioning Your Future Success
I don’t put much stock in palm readers, tarot cards, or crystal balls, but the
futures they foretell do carry some validity. Alexander the Great was prophe-
sied to become a great leader, and he certainly fulfilled that prophecy. The
way I see it, however, is that the prophecy that was drilled into Alexander
from the time he was a young boy motivated him to strive for what he truly
believed was his destiny and spurred him on to achieving that destiny.
The most successful people in any field form a clear vision of their destiny,
believe in it strongly, and work tirelessly to achieve it. Thus, their destiny ulti-
mately becomes their reality. Those who seize their own destiny typically
follow a three-step process:
1. Envision the ideal.
2. Imagine how you’re going to act when you’ve achieved that ideal.
3. Act the way you would act if you had already achieved that ideal.
In the following sections, I describe each stage in the process in greater
detail, so you can begin to achieve your destiny immediately.
Envisioning your success is the first step to building your own self-fulfilling
prophecy.
38
Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 

Envisioning the ideal
Imagine yourself in the perfect position. Are you working for someone else or
do you have your own business? Are you married or single? Do you have kids?
If so, how many? Are you dressed in a suit and tie or do you dress casually for
work? What kind of house do you live in? What kind of car do you drive? 
A few people manage to stumble their way to becoming highly successful, but
most highly successful people have a clear picture in their minds of what suc-
cess is before they set out on their journey to get there. If your dream is to
have your own business, imagine where it’s located, what products and serv-
ices it offers, how many people it employs, and how those people act. 
With a clear vision in mind, you have a destination. You define your own des-
tiny. Believe in that destiny, and you’re already well on your way to making it
your reality.
Imagining how you’re going to act
Forget for awhile all the work required to achieve your destiny. Imagine that
you’ve already achieved it and are living your dream. How do you dress? How
do you carry yourself? How do you treat your customers, colleagues, and
competitors?
The only difference between someone who’s successful and someone who’s
not is that the successful person acts successful. Acting successful is being
successful. By forming a clear image in your mind of how you believe you
would act when you’re living your dream, you know the type of behavior
required to attain that dream. You can then begin to act out your reality, as
explained in the following section.
Don’t confuse acting successful with pretending to be successful and boast-
ing about your success. Most people who spend a lot of time talking about
how successful they are aren’t successful. They’re simply trying to convince
themselves as much as they’re trying to convince you. Boasting is a big
turnoff that can destroy any future opportunities. 
Your sales heroes and other role models can assist you in formulating what you
consider to be successful behavior. Keep in mind, however, that you’re a unique
individual, and your view of success is whatever you determine it is. Never
let others define you, and certainly never allow them to impose their limitations
on you.
39
Chapter 2: Visualizing Yourself as a Power Seller 

Acting out your reality
To avoid becoming simply a “legend in your own mind,” translate the destiny
you imagine for yourself (see the section, “Envisioning the ideal,” earlier in
this chapter) into behaviors. In other words, you’ve talked the talk, now start
walking the walk. Start behaving as if you’ve already achieved your destiny.
Follow this bit of advice within reason, of course. If you imagine yourself as
an independently wealthy philanthropist and start giving away all of your
money and then some, you can get yourself into some deep trouble. Behaving
as if you’ve already achieved your destiny means behaving in a business rela-
tionship according to your ideal vision. In other words, walk the walk. 
Your family members and perhaps a few of your less ambitious colleagues
may consider you delusional, but the only way you’re going to improve your
results as a salesperson is to improve the way you act. And if you’re not
acting in line with your ideal, you’re not quite there and are highly unlikely of
ever getting there.
This isn’t a one-day or one-week free trial period or dress rehearsal. Behaving
as if you’ve already achieved your destiny takes some practice, and you’re
likely to regress into your old behaviors once in awhile when you’re first
starting out. Stick with it. Eventually, any positive changes in your behavior
will result in positive changes to the reality around you.
Applying visualization to sales
Envisioning your future success (see the section, “Envisioning the ideal,” ear-
lier in this chapter) and then behaving as though you’ve already achieved
that success (see the section, “Acting out your reality,” earlier in this chap-
ter) are effective strategies for professionals, athletes, students, and anyone
else with imagination and determination. 
Power sellers often apply the strategies by imagining how they’ll act on a
sales call. Whenever I’m heading out to meet a client, I rehearse the entire
meeting in my mind from the time I knock on the door until we sign the
papers, reminding myself of exactly the way I need to behave to close the
sale. Mentally rehearsing the flow of the conversation and potential objec-
tions can also ensure that you’re prepared to be successful in the meeting
and that you achieve all of your preconceived objectives.
40
Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 

As a salesperson, sell yourself on the fact that the sale is yours for the taking.
Envision your meeting with the client. You can even write up a script and
rehearse with your colleagues or with friends or family members to “get into
character.” You may even try practicing in front of a mirror. When the curtain
rises, all the preparation you invested in rehearsals makes your sales presen-
tation that much more natural and effective. Skip to Chapter 6, “Honing Your
Craft,” for additional advice on how to prepare for a sales call and improve
your sales presentation.

Charting Your Roadmap 
to Sales Success

 Planning your strategy to increase sales
 Creating your to-do list
 Being accountable for your own success
 Enjoying the fruits of your labor
 Adjusting your game plan to maximize positive results
S
uccess rarely happens by mistake. It requires planning, execution, and
hard work. You set a goal, figure out how you’re going to get there, pull
together everything you need to execute your plan, and then work your plan
the best you can in the hopes of boosting sales and profits. 
In this chapter, you chart the course to your sales success, draw up a list of
tools and resources required, and formulate a clear idea of how you’re going
to get from point A to point B. And if you happen to veer off course, this
chapter shows you how to get back on track and perhaps even discover a
couple detours to shorten the journey.
Planning is always a necessity, whether you’re just starting out, have
achieved some level of success, or recently suffered a setback. Effective plan-
ning assists you in achieving success, avoiding failure, and recovering from
disappointments. Always be planning.
Drawing Up Your Sales Plan
Stop thinking of yourself as a salesperson or an employee. I’m promoting 
you to entrepreneur. Whether or not you own your own business, you are a
business — a revenue-generating entity . . . You, Inc. As such, one of your 

44
Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 
primary responsibilities is to draw up a business plan — in this case, a sales
plan. You’re going to plot point A (current sales) and point B (your sale goal)
and then chart the course that leads you from point A to point B.
Drawing up a sales plan is a seven-step process:
1. Determine where you are.
2. Set a goal.
3. Set a timeframe.
4. Identify your objectives.
5. Figure out a strategy.
6. Identify tasks.
7. Identify resources.
The following sections describe these seven steps in greater detail.
Your sales plan may not work out quite the way you expect it to, but the
process of planning forces you to think about your goals and more impor-
tantly how you are going to achieve those goals. Even if your plan is only 50
percent effective, that’s 50 percent better than having no plan.
Determining where you are
I consult with both individual salespeople and small to large companies. You
would be surprised at just how many of these individuals and companies are
flying by the seat of their pants. Several don’t even have a clear idea of where
they are in terms of sales, revenue, and expenses or where they want to be
one year or five years down the road.
First, you have to establish where you are in terms of sales and the effort
you’re investing in marketing to figure out where you’re going in terms of
sales, revenue, and growth. To get a clear idea of where you stand, jot down
the following:
 Current gross sales annually.
 Amount of time you typically invest in your business annually.
 Sales-per-hour earnings: Divide your annual gross sales revenue by the
number of hours you work per year.
 Annual sales expenses, including your personal outlay for marketing
materials, equipment, supplies, and so on.
 Dollar investment per dollar of sales: Divide your annual sales expenses
by your annual gross sales.

The most important numbers you jot down are your sales-per-hour earnings
and dollar investment per dollar of sales. Think of these numbers as your
sales efficiency ratings. They’re sort of like golf scores — the lower the
number, the fewer times you have to swing to score a sale. Track the num-
bers over time to measure your progress.
Setting a goal
By their very nature, sales goals are production-based — as a salesperson,
your goal is to sell more stuff. Determination, effort, and your engaging person-
ality are certainly important, but unless they generate more revenue, they
don’t really show up on the balance sheet at the end of the year. When setting a
sales goal, focus on increasing revenue. Here are a few examples of sales goals:
 Increase gross sales by at least 20 percent.
 Increase the net profit on products and services by at least five percent.
 Line up 15 new customers.
 Increase existing customer orders by 10 percent.
45
Chapter 3: Charting Your Roadmap to Sales Success
Beware of sales quotas
Imposing a strict sales quota on yourself or
having one imposed on you is often counter-
productive. I prefer to steer clear of quotas,
because they can lead to several negative con-
sequences:
 Derail the sales process: Increased pres-
sure to meet quotas can tempt you to push
a prospective buyer right out of deciding to
buy a product. You need to set your pace in
relation to your customer, not in service to
some arbitrary sales quota
 Reduce the profit-per-sale: Sales quotas are
often attached to certain dates, such as end-
of-month, end-of-quarter, and end-of-year.
When buyers are aware of these quotas,
they gain an upper hand in the negotiating
process and can pressure you to accept a
lower price simply to close the sale.
 Crush a salesperson’s confidence: Failure
can shake anyone’s confidence. Conditions
outside your control can cause you to miss
the quota even if you did quite well given
the conditions you were facing. 
A sales quota, in and of itself is not necessarily
a bad thing, but an obsession with meeting a
quota can negatively impact sales and profits.
Use a sales goal or quota only as a tool to moti-
vate yourself and a milestone against which you
measure your progress. Focus more on the
objectives, strategies, and tasks you must
accomplish in order to achieve your goal. In
other words, focus on the process you’re going
to follow, and your productivity is almost guar-
anteed to rise as a result.

Note that these goals simply state the desired end result. They say nothing
about how you’re going to achieve that goal or the amount of time you have
to reach your goal. You can work in these details later, as described in the fol-
lowing sections.
For more about goal setting, specifically for salespeople, check out Selling For
Dummies, by Tom Hopkins. Hopkins devotes an entire chapter on how to set
meaningful sales goals and hold yourself accountable.
Don’t share goals with non-goal-setters, like your buddy who defines success
as drinking a six-pack of beer every Friday night. People who don’t set goals
tend to put down those who do. They can kill your dreams.
Setting a timeframe
Setting open-ended goals is an invitation to procrastinate, so every goal
should have a deadline. Now, I’m not saying that you should become
obsessed with the deadline or let it influence sales negotiations or the way
you treat your clients. A deadline simply enables you to measure your
progress over time and make the necessary adjustments to your plan later.
After jotting down your sales goal, specify a timeframe for achieving that
goal. If the goal seems unrealistic in terms of the timeframe, consider break-
ing down the goal into incremental goals. If you have a goal to sell 500 cars a
year, for example, consider setting a goal to sell 40 cars per month. If that still
seems overwhelming, think of it as selling two cars a day (based on a five-day
workweek). And if the goal still seems unrealistic, consider trimming it back a
bit. Goals should stretch you, not break you.
Have you ever noticed that the less time you have to complete a task, the
more you accomplish? If you’re constantly missing deadlines, you may be
tempted to extend your deadlines. Instead of taking that approach, try tight-
ening your deadlines to see what happens. Many people find that the tighter
the deadline, the more energy they funnel into completing the task, and the
faster they get it accomplished.
Identifying your objectives
Objectives answer the question “How I am going to achieve my goal?” with-
out going into great detail. Following are some examples that pair up goals
with objectives:
46
Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 

Goal: Increase gross sales by at least 20 percent.
Objective: Convert 20 percent more initial contacts into sales.
Goal: Increase the net profit on products and services by at least five 
percent.
Objective: Increase the markup on all products by five percent across the
board.
Goal: Increase existing customer orders by 10 percent.
Objective: Improve relationships with existing customers.
While the goal is fairly concrete, the objective or the way you plan on achiev-
ing that goal can vary. If your goal is to increase sales by at least 20 percent,
for example, you can achieve that goal with any number of different objec-
tives, including the following:
 Convert 20 percent more initial contacts into sales.
 Ramp up prospecting efforts.
 Implement an Internet marketing program.
 Increase up-sell opportunities.
Figuring out a strategy
At this point, you should know what you’re going to do and have a general
idea of how you’re going to do it, but now you need to answer the question
“How am I going to fulfill my objective?” This is where strategy comes into
play. Think of strategy as the bird’s-eye-view of how you’re going to fulfill
your objective and hence achieve your goal. The following examples pair up
objectives with strategies:
Objective: Convert 20 percent more initial contacts into sales.
Strategy: Focus efforts on high-quality leads.
Objective: Ramp up prospecting efforts.
Strategy: Devote one day per week to prospecting.
Objective: Implement an Internet marketing program.
Strategy: Launch a corporate Web site and blog.
47
Chapter 3: Charting Your Roadmap to Sales Success

Objective: Increase up-sell opportunities.
Strategy: Add a product line.
If you’re having a tough time distinguishing between goals, objectives, and
strategies, you’re not alone. The differences are pretty subtle. Think of it this
way: Say your goal is to learn a foreign language (Spanish, for example),
here’s how your goal, objective, and strategy may look:
Goal: Communicate with Spanish-speaking clients.
Objective: Study Spanish.
Strategy: Take Spanish classes at the city college.
Of course, I could achieve that same goal by fulfilling a different objective —
for example, hiring a Spanish-speaking assistant. I could also meet my objec-
tive by employing any of several strategies for learning Spanish, including
reading Spanish For Dummies, listening to Spanish lessons on tapes or CDs,
or using computer-based Spanish learning software. 
Don’t spend too much time trying to distinguish the difference between
objectives and strategies. As long as you have a goal and a clear vision of
how you’re going to achieve that goal, you’re ready to identify the tasks you
must accomplish to get there (speaking of which, see the next section,
“Identifying tasks,” to get started on that list).
Identifying tasks
If you think of your goal as your ultimate destination, the tasks are the steps
you take to reach that destination (by executing your strategy and achieving
your objective). Think of tasks as your to-do list. If you accomplish everything
on your list, you can’t help but achieve your goal . . . theoretically, at least. 
Say you have a goal to increase sales by 20 percent. Your objective is to maxi-
mize up-sell opportunities, and your strategy is to add a new product line.
Your tasks are then the steps you must take to add the product line. You may
come up with something like this:
1. Poll customers to determine market demand for various products.
2. Research products for salability and profitability.
3. Identify suppliers.
4. Compare prices, quality, and service.
5. Select products to include in new product line.
6. Market products to new and existing customers.
48
Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 

When jotting down tasks you must accomplish, forget about the order of the
tasks. Do a brain dump. Jot down all the tasks, and if they need to be accom-
plished in order, like steps, then you can go back and rearrange your list.
What’s most important is that the list covers everything.
Identifying resources
When you’re drafting your roadmap to success, don’t overlook the fact that
you need to pack some supplies. In the case of planning to achieve a business-
related goal, the supplies you need basically come down to time, money,
equipment, and people (human resources). An effective plan identifies all the
resources you need and ultimately functions as a grocery list, simplifying the
process of procuring essential resources.

Chapter 3: Charting Your Roadmap to Sales Success
Getting buy-in: A tip for sales managers
If you’re a sales manager, resist any urge you
may have to impose your sales goals and plan
on your sales staff. A much more effective
approach is to involve your staff in setting their
own goals. This approach offers several bene-
fits, including the following: 
 Sales reps are more likely to buy into the
goals and take ownership of them.
 Sales reps may act more as entrepreneurs
and have a stronger sense of empower-
ment and accountability.
 Diverse goals may encourage development of
more creative and effective sales strategies. 
 Setting goals as a team may foster cooper-
ation among sales reps that could lead to
increased productivity for the entire sales
department.
As a sales manager, I would often set sales
goals for my salespeople and share those goals
with them. Unfortunately, this practice sent one
of my best salespeople packing. 
This particular real estate agent was one of the
top salespeople I’ve ever trained. In one year,
he sold 157 homes, which is an incredible
number. Unbeknownst to me, he had set sales
goals and developed his own business plan. His
goal was to sell 125 homes. My goal was for him
to sell 175 homes. Both of our plans were
designed to increase revenue. My plan called
for selling 20 percent more houses while his
called for selling fewer houses at a 20 percent
higher profit. His plan would actually have
resulted in a bigger boost in revenue than my
plan had called for, with the added bonus of
giving him more quality time with his family and
friends.
Unaware that my top salesperson had his own
plan in place, I shared with him the fact that I
had expected him to sell 175 houses. Under-
standably, he felt as though I didn’t appreciate
his efforts. Before I could correct my mistake,
my top salesperson was headed out the door 
to launch his own business. He’s doing very
well.
If you supervise a sales staff, I strongly encour-
age you to team up with your staff to set goals
rather than imposing your goals on them. 

To identify the resources required to accomplish your goal, answer the fol-
lowing questions:
 How many total hours are required to complete all tasks?
 How much time can I commit to the project?
 What expertise is needed that I don’t currently have?
 How much money is this going to cost?
 Do I need any special equipment, such as a computer?
 Are some resources already available?
When developing your resource list, don’t limit yourself. Make it a wish list.
Ideally, what would you need to accomplish all of the required tasks as
quickly and easily as possible? Be creative. Once you have your wish list in
place, you can edit it based on the amount of time, money, and existing
resources you have at your disposal.
Prioritizing Your Tasks
When drawing up a sales plan, you may find yourself with dozens of tasks
you must tend to. Your to-do list can become overwhelming, perhaps so over-
whelming that it causes you to freeze up. Not knowing where to start, you
can’t get moving. If you find yourself in the deep freeze, take some time to pri-
oritize your tasks.
Prioritizing tasks doesn’t always mean that you tackle the most important
tasks first. When arranging the items on your to-do list, you have several
options:
 Step-by-step: If the tasks must be performed in a certain order, prioritiz-
ing is as easy as one, two, three. Arrange the tasks in the order you need
to perform them, and then follow the steps. 
 Order of importance: Complete the tasks that are key to the success of
a project first.
 Most profitable first: If you have several tasks, and one particular task
has the potential of making you some quick cash or increasing profits
immediately, why wait? Do the money-making tasks first.
 Hardest thing first: If one task is significantly more difficult than the
others, consider tackling it first. A difficult task can function as a huge
mental block that prevents you from moving forward. Tackle the most
difficult task first. When it’s out of the way, the rest of the process is
smooth sailing. 
50
Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 

 Easiest thing first: If confronting the most difficult challenge first is just
too overwhelming, deal with something easier. This can give you some
momentum to move on to other, more difficult tasks.
 Most obvious first: A task may present itself as obviously something 
you must do immediately — perhaps you have all the resources you
need, you have some free time, and you just realized that this is some-
thing you have to do.
Your first priority at the beginning of every day is to prioritize the items on
your to-do-list. When I prioritize, I generally tackle the most difficult tasks first.
I call the people I don’t want to talk to, address any problems that cross my
desk, and immediately tend to the task I’m most strongly inclined to avoid. I
then focus on the most profitable activities, what I call dollar-productive activi-
ties, which I learned from the “Condo King,” Allen Domb, while shadowing him.
If I have any time left near the end of the day, I deal with the remaining items in
their order of importance.
Putting Your Plan into Action 
with the Strebor System
Awhile back, I realized that “Roberts” spelled backwards is “Strebor,” and I
worked out a system for effectively implementing any plan for success. When
you’re ready to put your plan into action, follow the Strebor System:
S: Sticktoitism is the dogged determination required to ensure that you
follow through on your plan.
T: Training provides you with the know-how and skills to properly exe-
cute your plan.
R: Results are what you build on as you attain higher and higher levels of
success.
E: Enthusiasm provides you with the ambition and energy required to
follow through.
B: Benefits give you the motivation to succeed.
O: Optimism is the confidence that enables you to overcome obstacles.
R: Reach is your commitment to taking risks and seizing opportunities
that make you grow both professionally and personally.
51
Chapter 3: Charting Your Roadmap to Sales Success

Tracking Your Progress
Some people do a great job in the planning stage and may even succeed in
executing their plans to perfection, but they drop the ball when it comes to
tracking their progress. As a result, they don’t know whether they’re making
any headway.
Put a system in place for tracking your progress. Following are some 
suggestions: 
 Checklists: You can implement a system of annual, monthly, weekly, and
daily checklists to keep yourself on track and measure your progress.
Audit your lists at the end of each period to determine how well you’ve
done and set more challenging goals moving forward. Start every day
with a list of things to do in the order in which you need to do them and
then — do them! 
 Success journal: Make daily or weekly entries in your journal to keep
track of what’s working and what’s not.
 Idea of the week book: Prompted by Ira Hayes, I’ve been keeping an
idea of the week book for 25 years. In it, I jot down my idea of the week,
and if the idea is worth pursuing, I give it a shot. Then I jot down the
results.
 Lifetime achievement book: Think of this as the equivalent of a profit-
and-loss statement. Instead of listing your financial profits and losses,
you can describe your achievements and setbacks. Over time, the book
comes to represent a measure of your success and can point you in the
right direction.
Holding Yourself Accountable
Whether or not you have a boss, a manager, or a supervisor, as a power seller,
you are ultimately your own boss and should be more demanding of yourself
than any boss could ever be. The responsibility for achieving your goals sits
squarely on your shoulders. It’s up to you to hold yourself accountable.
As motivational speaker Bob Perks says, “Don’t blame others for your failure
to be fully accountable for your own life. If others are to blame then you have
given them control.”
If you’re not qualified to hold yourself accountable, consider taking on a per-
sonal partner, as explained in Chapter 7, “Raising the Bar with Personal
Partnering.”

Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 

Celebrating Your Success
If you love to sell, chances are pretty good that you don’t need much motiva-
tion to do it. For you, selling may be your essence, an intrinsic pleasure that
you would continue to indulge in even if you were independently wealthy.
Most salespeople, however, are better at selling when they have some exter-
nal motivation — a reward for a job well done.
Although I love to sell, I dangle rewards in front of myself to rev up my sales
engine. I encourage my sales staff and family members to reward themselves,
as well, as a way of giving their goals a more emotional connection. After all,
money is a meager measure of success. If that money represents a two-week
vacation with your family, a car you’ve always dreamed of, or early retire-
ment, then achieving your sales goals becomes much more meaningful.
In the following sections, I encourage you to pat yourself on the back for a
job well done and reward yourself early as an added incentive to achieve
your goals.
Rewarding yourself for a job well done
Sales goals can seem somewhat meaningless. Boosting sales by 20 percent or
increasing your sales commissions by $50,000 a year are certainly noble goals
for your company, but what do they mean for you as a person? To increase your
motivation to achieve a goal, make your future success more meaningful by
offering yourself a tangible reward. What do you want as a result of your efforts?
When you know what you want, create a mental image of it:
 Write a detailed description of the reward. Whether you want a fancy
new car, early retirement, or the ability to help less fortunate family
members and friends, describe your dream in detail, as if you were
already living it.
 Create a reward collage. Cut out pictures that remind you of your
reward and hang them on your refrigerator door or in your office or
paste them on poster board to create a collage.
 Sample the reward. Get a small taste of the reward. If you’re thinking of
rewarding yourself with a fancy new sports car, for example, head down
to the dealership and take it for a test drive. Craving a luxurious new
home? Attend some open houses of homes that you think may fit the bill.
 Share your vision. Tell your family, friends, and colleagues about your
dreams of success. In addition to creating a clearer mental image of the
reward for you, this subtly makes you accountable to others and
increases your motivation to achieve your goal.
53
Chapter 3: Charting Your Roadmap to Sales Success

Rewarding yourself for a job 
about to be well done
When you get tired of rewarding yourself for all of your accomplishments,
consider a different approach — reward yourself prior to achieving your goal.
Occasionally, I use this method to motivate myself. I find the reward I want,
charge it on my credit card, and then work to earn enough money to pay for
the item before my credit card statement arrives in the mail and I actually
have to pay for what I purchased.
Don’t get into the habit of buying stuff that you don’t have the money to pay
for. That could get you into trouble. I’m merely suggesting that you try this
approach for a change of pace.
Revising Your Roadmap
Drawing up the perfect sales plan and executing it to perfection doesn’t nec-
essarily guarantee success. In some cases, you may fall short of your goals. In
more fortunate situations, your success exceeds your wildest imagination.
Whatever the result, you usually have to revisit your sales plan regularly to
see just where you’ve ended up and what adjustments are required to get
back on track or change your direction to achieve even loftier goals.
In the following sections, I reveal the importance of revising your sales plan
to accommodate unexpected shortcomings and take advantage of unantici-
pated success.
54
Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 
Putting a face on your goals
I encourage the agents in my office to share
their personal goals. One year, I took a large roll
of paper, cut it into six-foot sheets, wrote an
agent’s name at the top of each sheet, and
taped them up all over the building. I asked the
agents to create a collage that would represent
their goals. In addition to generating a deeper
sense of camaraderie amongst the staff, I saw
a near immediate boost in morale and produc-
tivity. The agents now had a clearer idea of
what they were working for. 
Goals can seem a little too nebulous at times. To
bring them down to earth, put a face on them by
connecting them with something you find
rewarding. What’s rewarding is different for
everyone. Some people get excited about pro-
motions and job titles, while others like money
or time off. Find out what motivates you (and
your staff, if you’re a manager), and you will
unlock the secret of happy production.

You’re better off aiming too high and missing the mark than always achieving
less ambitious goals. If you fall short of a goal, you can always extend the
timeframe, but if you constantly meet unchallenging goals, you’re never going
to achieve your full potential.
Assessing your progress . . . or lack thereof
You set your goal and specified a timeframe for achieving it. When the time is
up, revisit the goal to determine whether you’ve accomplished it. Assuming
you set a measurable goal, you should come to one of three conclusions:
 You met your goal. 
 You exceeded your goal. 
 You didn’t quite get there.
If you met your goal, kudos for you! Skip back to the section on rewarding
yourself and collect your bonus. Then, return to the beginning of the chapter
and set new goals. If you missed your goal or exceeded it, you have more
work to do, as explained in the following sections. 
Correcting for wrong turns
When you miss your goal, it can only mean only one of three things: 
 The goal and timeframe were unrealistic. Perhaps you were a little too
ambitious. That’s perfectly understandable. As long as you’re making
progress, extending your deadline can put you back on track.
 Your plan was flawed. Plans don’t always work. What’s important is
that you realize the plan was flawed before you pour any more time,
money, or effort in it. You may have to dump the plan and start over or
make some adjustments.
 You failed to execute your plan properly. If you dropped the ball during
the execution of the plan, you can blame only yourself. Come clean
about it and renew your commitment.
Although you may need to dump your plan entirely, avoid dumping some-
thing that works. A single triumph can be the seed that grows into a hugely
successful new sales plan. Cut what doesn’t work and build on whatever’s
working.
The journey to success is like sailing across the ocean. A minor change in
course early in your journey can make a huge difference in where you ulti-
mately end up. You don’t always have to make sweeping changes.
55
Chapter 3: Charting Your Roadmap to Sales Success

Building on success
Sometimes, success can be more devastating than failure. You put a plan in
place to increase sales. The plan is a resounding success. Product is flying off
the shelves. Unfortunately, inventory is running low and you don’t have
another supplier lined up or you can’t ship product fast enough to meet
demand or you don’t have the support staff in place to keep all of your new
customers happy.
When you’re checking your progress toward accomplishing a particular sales
goal, be prepared for situations in which your success exceeds your expecta-
tions. An inability to change course to take advantage of unforeseen success
can negatively impact your sales and is certain to leave you with a missed
opportunity.

Making Selling Your Hobby 
and Your Habit
In This Chapter
 Starting the day out right
 Tuning into the people around you
 Gathering new sales techniques
 Field-testing newly acquired techniques
P
ower selling is a way of life. You gotta love it and live it and seize every
opportunity to discover how to do it better. Every encounter is an
opportunity for you to practice the art and science of selling, an opportunity
to hone your skills. 
I love selling, and I’m always selling something. Whether I’m eating out,
boarding an airplane, riding in a taxi, or checking into a hotel room, I’m sell-
ing. I can usually talk my way into first-class seating on flights and first-class
accommodations at hotels. Even when I fall short, I always meet someone,
and every one of those someone’s is a potential client and lead generator.
Every encounter makes me a slightly better salesperson. As you begin to
weave selling into every aspect of your life, you soon realize the infinite
opportunities it draws into your life.
In this chapter, I encourage you and show you how to approach selling with
the eagerness of an avid hobbyist. I show you how to start each day with the
right mindset, tune in to the people around you, and become more sensitive
to sales opportunities you may tend to overlook. I also show you how to
practice your sales skills, so selling becomes more of a habit than a job. 

58
Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 
Making Selling Your Hobby
A hobby can be a pretty intense activity that requires more energy and
investment than a full-time job, but hobbies rarely make you tired, rundown,
or stressed out. To the contrary. When you choose a hobby that’s right for
you, it recharges your batteries and makes you think more creatively. It
makes you want to stay up late at night and gives you a reason to wake up in
the morning. With a hobby, you learn without ever having to study, and
you’re naturally motivated to share information and insights with other
enthusiasts.
I encourage you to approach selling as a hobby rather than a job. If you treat
selling as a job, you’re unlikely to have the determination and energy to be
very good at it, and you’re more likely to get burned out. Following are some
tips that may be able to assist you in treating selling more like a hobby:
 Stop thinking about it. When you’re immersed in a hobby, you rarely
think about how enjoyable it is or how good you feel doing it. When
you’re getting paid to do something, however, you may be tempted to
overanalyze it. Focus on your work, and you’re going to have a lot more
fun doing it.
 Hang out with salespeople who love to sell. Hobbies are often refresh-
ing because they attract people who are enthusiastic about a common
interest. The positive energy emanated by others can fuel your own
enthusiasm.
 Continue to challenge yourself. Hobbyists often start with beginner kits
and work their way up to more and more advanced projects. When you
hit a plateau, raise the bar. You should always feel as though you’re
reaching for something higher.
 Develop new skills. Discovering new sales strategies and techniques
keeps you moving forward and feeling as though you’re making
progress. See “Discovering New Sales Techniques,” later in this chapter,
for details.
 Play. Hobbies are simply an adult form of playtime. Be a little more play-
ful in your job. Don’t be afraid to be yourself and take some chances.
Loosen up. Have fun.
The only difference between your hobby and your job should be that you
spend money on your hobby and you earn money with your job. The money
you earn is a measure of success, but satisfaction isn’t always tied to a prod-
uct or a paycheck. Selling is presenting an idea or sharing a moment with
someone you may or may not meet again. Selling is about making that
moment a positive influence on someone’s day or life. 

Selling isn’t for everyone. If you’ve done your best to make selling feel more
like a hobby than a job, and selling still doesn’t rev your engine, consider
changing jobs. To perform at your peak in any field of endeavor, you gotta
have passion — a bowl of sticktoitism with a big scoop of enthusiasm.
Thinking Like an Entrepreneur
Throughout the years, I’ve heard many salespeople, even good ones, utter
phrases like, “You just get the customers in the door, and I’ll do the rest.”
That’s the sort of passive attitude that makes you an order taker, not a sales-
person. According to the law of attrition, order takers are being eliminated,
while the entrepreneurial power sellers achieve even greater success.
59
Chapter 4: Making Selling Your Hobby and Your Habit
Mastering the Bob approach
I met Bob, the baggage handler, for the first time
at Detroit Metro Airport when I was heading out
on my first book tour for Walk Like a Giant, Sell
Like a Madman. I was so excited about the
book, I passed out copies to everyone I met, and
when Bob greeted me at the curb, I immediately
felt a blast of enthusiasm that earned him one
of the first copies. 
Bob may not consider himself a salesman, but
he’s one of the best I’ve ever met. Whenever I
pull up to the curb during Bob’s shift, he imme-
diately greets me and tells everyone in line who
I am and how excited he is to see me. He makes
me feel like a rock star. In spite of all the
Homeland Security policies, Bob remains posi-
tive and establishes a personal relationship with
all of his clients, while processing passengers
efficiently to get them to their gates as quickly
as possible.
I don’t know how much Bob earns, but with a
few adjustments, a guy like Bob could probably
earn ten times as much as the average baggage
handler. Imagine if the baggage handlers all
worked together, handed out business cards,
and established relationships with their pas-
sengers. They could motivate one another to
work harder, share tips on how to work smarter,
market their services, and have much more fun.
They could probably make as much as $15 an
hour in salary and another $50 an hour in tips,
earning a six-figure income.
Regardless of your occupation, you can boost
your income and increase your job satisfaction
simply by treating your job like a hobby and
giving clients the service and attention they
crave.

Order takers think and act much differently than entrepreneurs, which
results in the entrepreneurs becoming power sellers. If you’re an order taker,
switch gears to a power seller by changing your mindset:
 An order taker waits for success — a power seller pursues it. At a
restaurant, an order taker asks to take your order, whereas an entrepre-
neurial server says, “Let me tell you about our specials,” and then pro-
ceeds to describe them in delicious detail and credits the chef. Instead
of asking whether you’re ready for your bill, the entrepreneurial server
brings the dessert tray. 
 An order taker backs down in the face of a client’s objections — a
power seller comes up with answers to objections before the meeting
even takes place. Order takers pick only the low-hanging fruit, even if
they can readily see better fruit a little higher up on the tree. When a
great prospect raises an objection to the sale, which is often a sign that
the client is interested, the order taker backs away, assuming she lost
the sale. A power seller has already rehearsed how she’s going to
respond to the objection long before the prospect ever expresses it.
 An order taker relies solely on the company for marketing — a power
seller invests in his own shameless self promotion. Long-term success
demands that you become a brand name company unto yourself. Even if
the company you work for does an outstanding job of building its own
brand presence and generating business for you, you should be market-
ing yourself. See Chapter 9 for additional details.
 An order taker complains when the company fails to supply him with
the tools he needs to succeed — a power seller invests in his own suc-
cess. Although you should certainly try to convince the company to pick
up the tab for the equipment and other resources you need, you shouldn’t
wait around for them to do it if they refuse. As a power seller, you are
responsible for your own success. See Chapter 11 for additional details.
A true salesperson functions as an independent contractor. Think of yourself
as a corporation — You, Inc. Your corporation can be as small or as large as
you want it to be. You can invest as much or as little time as you want in
making it a success. You can procure the supplies and human resources you
need to take your corporation to the next level. Begin thinking as an entrepre-
neur, and your sales potential becomes unlimited.
If you don’t already consider yourself an independent contractor, retool your
thinking, and start behaving like an entrepreneur:
 If you’re not already receiving commissions, negotiate commissions-
based compensation with you supervisor or find a position with a com-
pany that pays its salespeople commissions. 
 Develop your own sales plan, as discussed in Chapter 3.
60
Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 

 Don’t blame or complain. As an entrepreneur, you are completely
responsible for your own success.
 Set your own hours and schedule. You should be making a majority of
the decisions that shape your day. 
 Acquire the means to achieve your goals. If your company won’t shell
out the money for equipment, marketing materials, an assistant, or what-
ever else you need, pay for it out of your own pocket. For more ideas on
how to invest in your own success, check out Chapter 11.
Twenty percent of all salespeople are making more money than the other 80
percent combined. Where do you fall in?
Greeting the Day with the 
Power Selling Attitude
Have you ever walked out of a store with something you purchased and sud-
denly realized that you really didn’t need it or want it? I buy a lot of products,
and this happens to me all the time. Even though I know all of the sales tac-
tics and tricks, the salesperson was able to convince me to buy something I
neither needed nor wanted. How was that possible?
When a salesperson is capable of selling me, it’s usually because I like the
person. Sure, she knows her product and asks questions to find out what I’m
looking for, but my decision to buy is based on more than that. I end up liking
the salesperson, and the main reason for that is because the person has con-
fidence and an engaging personality. They’ve got it. Some don’t have it. Some
have it and just don’t use it. The people who sell me have it and flaunt it.
Are you fair, good, very good, great, excellent, or unbelievable? Power selling
is about being unbelievable. As a salesperson, you’re selling more than a
product or service. You’re selling yourself. Sell yourself successfully, and
prospective clients are much more likely to purchase whatever it is you’re
selling. Once you grasp advanced selling strategies and make them a part of
who you are, you can hop to any company in any industry and sell anything.
If you’re not meeting your sales goals, you may have to give yourself an atti-
tude adjustment. Chapter 2 offers some suggestions on how to readjust your
thinking to give yourself a more positive perspective, but indulge in anything
that gets you revved up and in the proper mood:
 Listen to motivational tapes, CDs, or MP3s on your way to work. 
 Pump yourself up with some uplifting music.
61
Chapter 4: Making Selling Your Hobby and Your Habit

 Listen to something funny — a morning radio show or recordings of
standup comedians.
 Exercise regularly so you feel physically fit.
 Eat foods that make you feel more energetic, and avoid foods that drain
your energy. Check out Nutrition For Dummies for some suggestions.
 Change something in your work environment or redecorate your office.
 Try a new hairstyle or outfit.
When you don’t feel good about yourself and what you’re doing, prospective
customers can sense your inner discomfort, and it can often make them feel
uncomfortable around you. Do whatever it takes to feel good about yourself.
This includes attending to any issues at home that may be dragging you
down.
When I was 40, I was getting ready to go on a family trip to Florida. I had the
bright idea to have my hair highlighted. My family was in shock. Mr.Guy Next
Door, Mr. Most Successful in Real Estate had his hair highlighted! My family
immediately sent me back to the hair salon. The moral to the story? If you’re
thinking of making a dramatic change in your appearance, consult your part-
ner or someone else who has a vested interest in making sure you don’t look
like a fool.
Engaging People Throughout Your Day
Selling takes much more than pitching a product to a prospective customer.
Selling is about building a mutually beneficial relationships. Work on improv-
ing your relationship skills. The more you practice, the more comfortable you
become dealing with people, and dealing with people is what selling is all
about. (It’s not about the bottom line. That will take care of itself.)
To make selling more like a hobby and improve your ability to build relation-
ships with people, engage people throughout your day. Whether you’re out
shopping, working out at the gym, standing in the elevator, or waiting in line
at the movie theater, establish eye contact with someone and try to strike up
a conversation. Every connection you make is an opportunity to practice
your relationship-building skills.
In the following sections, I provide a couple tips on how to present yourself
and make a positive first impression. Later in this chapter, in the section,
“Discovering Opportunities to Ply Your Trade,” I show you how to practice
your sales skills in situations you may not associate with sales.

Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 

Projecting a professional image
A key factor in becoming a more engaging salesperson is to project a profes-
sional image — an image that conveys the fact that you know what you’re
doing and are genuinely interested in the people you meet.
Perception is reality. Your customer’s perception of you is the only you she
knows. By knowing what you’re trying to present and becoming more sensi-
tive to how people actually perceive you, you can close the gap between how
people perceive you and how you want to be perceived.
Developing and projecting a professional image is a five-step process:
1. Know what you’re presenting by the way you dress, what you say,
how you say it, how well you listen, and how you interact with people.
2. Become more aware of how people are perceiving you. You may even
consider asking a friend or colleague or even a client you feel comfort-
able with “how you come across to people.” 
3. Draw up a list of image enhancements — adjustments you can make to
improve your image.
4. Implement the positive changes from Step 3.
5. Jump back to Step 2 and repeat the process to make sure you’re fol-
lowing your plan and that the changes you’ve made are having the
desired effects.
Attend to all of the characteristics that others perceive and use to form an
opinion of you. If you’re dressed well, present yourself with confidence, and
then spew fourth foul language, those obscenities are likely to undermine all
other efforts at projecting a positive image.
Making a great first impression
You don’t get a second shot at making a great first impression, so do it prop-
erly right from the start:
1. Smile. A smile opens the doors to communication and invites the other
person inside.
2. Look ’em in the eye. Actors often use a one-eye technique for close
encounters, because if you try looking at both eyes, your eyes may
move back and forth slightly, giving you that shifty-eyed look. Most
people can’t tell when someone’s looking them in one eye instead of
both, but they can tell if someone is looking at their eyebrows or fore-
head. Whatever you do, don’t stare. If the other person glances away,
you’re probably staring.
63
Chapter 4: Making Selling Your Hobby and Your Habit

3. Shake hands. Remember to maintain eye contact and a pleasant facial
expression when you are shaking hands. 
4. Stand up straight but not stiff. Imagine a string connected to the crown
of your head that’s pulling you upward and a string attached to your
navel that’s being pulled from behind you. Consider practicing good pos-
ture when you’re standing in line, and practice enough to make it a
habit.
5. Watch what you say and how you say it. Shoot for a G-rating on your
vocabulary. Nobody’s going to miss the four-letter words. Your nonver-
bal presentation is equally important. Speak clearly and loud enough for
the person to hear without feeling as though you’ve cranked the speak-
ers up too loud. Your tone of voice and facial expressions communicate
more than you may realize.
6. Move with conviction and confidence. Practice giving yourself a reason
to move. If you’re heading over to the fax machine to pick up an incom-
ing message, consider pretending that you’re retrieving the president’s
schedule while he’s waiting on the other line. This trains you to move
with purpose. 
Your standard meet-and-greet may not be appropriate for people from differ-
ent cultures. To make sure you’re accommodating clients and prospects from
different cultures, check out Chapter 19, where diversity and sales expert
Michael Soon Lee of EthnoConnect and I provide some additional guidance
on dealing with multicultural clientele.
Discovering New Sales Techniques
Early in my career, I thought I knew everything about selling houses, and I
was doing pretty well, but I wasn’t what I would now consider a power seller.
Shortly after Kathleen and I married, she suggested that we take a trip to San
Francisco to attend the annual convention for the National Association of
Realtors. I always assumed that conventions were a waste of time, but
Kathleen loved San Francisco, and the convention gave us a convenient
excuse to fly out there.
I signed up for a few seminars and workshops just to check them out, expect-
ing them to simply rehash what I had already learned from the college of hard
knocks. Boy, was I surprised! I was astounded at how little I really knew. I dis-
covered much more effective ways of marketing and selling houses, boosting
my profits, and making my business run more efficiently. I returned to
Michigan packed with ideas and inspired by the top Realtors in the country,
who all happened to be at the convention. Now I was kicking myself for not
taking advantage of these opportunities earlier in my career.
64
Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 

To be a power seller, continually educate yourself and pick up new strategies
and techniques from other sales people. In the following sections, I point out
some of the best continuing education opportunities for salespeople.  
You don’t really know whether you’re good at something until you know
about that something and take it for a test drive. Sales books, CDs, seminars,
workshops, and other educational resources expose you to different sales
strategies and techniques you may not have been aware of and may be really
good at. To remain at the top of your game, continue to seek out educational
opportunities.
Reading up on new selling strategies
Throughout this book, I suggest various high-octane ways to boost sales and
maximize your exposure to sales opportunities. I assume that you’ve already
read a beginning-level book on sales, such as Selling For Dummies. I encour-
age you to sample some additional books, as well, and explore various sales
strategies, including solution selling, SPIN selling, and question-based selling.
In addition to strategies similar to these, in Chapters 6 and 21, I highlight sev-
eral sales techniques that I like to use.
Every expert on the topic of selling has a slightly different approach. By read-
ing widely instead of buying into a single strategy, you can form your own
unique sales strategy that fits best with your personality and approach. 
You don’t have to start over to get your career on the right course. Make
incremental adjustments one or two degrees at a time. A cruise liner doesn’t
turn 90 degrees at a time. It changes course by a few degrees at a time, which
over the course of hundreds or thousands of miles makes a huge difference.
Take the same long-term approach in your career. Otherwise, changes may
seem too overwhelming, leading you to make no positive change at all. Visit
www.simpletruths.com/aff/046/TTWD for an inspirational movie on the
power of small changes called 212 Degrees.
Tuning into sales tapes and CDs
Books are great for providing detailed information, but nothing can replace
hearing the impassioned voice of a sales coach providing verbal instruction.
Even though I read every book about selling that I can get my hands on, I still
like to listen to authors on tapes and CDs. Now I even download podcasts and
listen to them.
Tapes, CDs, and other recordings of books on tape have one added 
advantage — you can listen while you’re on the road.

Chapter 4: Making Selling Your Hobby and Your Habit

Several years ago, I was diagnosed as having ADHD (Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder) and soon discovered that I could absorb more infor-
mation by listening to audio clips played at twice the speed. For more infor-
mation about ADD and ADHD, check out ADD and ADHD For Dummies, by Jeff
Strong, Michael O. Flanagan, and Lito Tejada-Flores.
Attending sales seminars and workshops
Books and audio recordings are certainly informative, but mastering a new
technique, particularly when it runs counter to something you’ve been taught
in the past, requires practice and feedback. Seminars and workshops provide
you with a more dynamic venue in which you can ask questions and perhaps
even rehearse new techniques.
Of course, not all seminars and workshops are of equal value, so choose care-
fully and look for those that feature a combination of the following: 
 Panels of top producers: You want to learn from the best, not those who
may someday be best.
 Big-name keynote speakers: In addition to giving you the chance to rub
elbows with success, this shows that the organization presenting the
seminar has spent some money invested in it.
 A wide variety of breakout sessions: Selling is a multifaceted art form,
so hone your skills in as many areas as possible.
 Networking time: Seminars expand what you know, but they also
expand who you know. You often discover more in the hallways and at
lunch than you do during the actual sessions. Meet the other attendees
and as many of the presenters as possible. If possible, meet each presen-
ter early on and obtain their materials, so you can determine which 
sessions to attend. 
One-day motivational seminars are great if you’re in bad need of a pep talk,
but don’t rely on them exclusively. Look for seminars that have more sub-
stance and provide you with educational opportunities to upgrade your skills.
Attending a seminar or workshop may require a significant investment of
time and money, especially if you have to travel very far, but the return on
your investment is usually worth it. In addition to obtaining practical sales
training, you have the opportunity to meet other top salespeople, pick up
additional techniques from them, and establish valuable professional 
connections.
When I go to a seminar with my assistant, I look for a central location to set
up my office. It is usually near the bar or restaurant area, where I know
people attending the seminar will congregate before and after each session.
This gives us a great opportunity to meet and really get to know attendees.

Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 

Swapping secrets with colleagues
One of the bonuses of working in sales is that most salespeople love to talk . . .
or maybe they just love to hear themselves talk. Whatever the case, they’re
usually willing to share what they’ve picked up in the course of their career.
Get connected with as many salespeople as possible and pick their brains.
Even if they sell in a completely different industry, they can offer tips and sug-
gestions that can stimulate your own creativity.
Sharing works both ways. When a less experienced salesperson comes to you
for assistance, don’t hesitate to offer your advice. Teaching is often one of the
best ways to master a technique, and I believe that if you learn something,
you have an obligation to pass it along.
Buying to learn
Every time you go shopping for something — a computer, cell phone, TV set,
car, house, whatever — you have an opportunity to watch another salesper-
son at work and pick up some new techniques.
After you buy something or decide not to buy something, do a brief analysis
of why you decided to buy the product or service or decided against buying
it. Whenever I go out to dinner, I observe the way the server tries to sell the
dessert. Some servers simply ask, “Can I interest you in some dessert?”
giving you the opportunity to say “No,” in which case, the discussion is over.
More savvy servers wave a dessert tray over the table, which usually sparks
a lively discussion that convinces at least one person at the table to indulge.
After one person orders dessert, the rest of the table usually follows suit. 
Test-driving new techniques
Salespeople are notorious for not following advice. They read a book on a
great new sales technique and a week later they’re delivering the same sales
pitch they’ve been using for the last five years. They hire a personal coach to
train them, pay the guy $300 and hour or more, and then simply fail to put
any of the training into practice.
I’m not saying you should immediately unleash your new, untested sales
strategies on unsuspecting customers, but you should start to work new
strategies into your repertoire as soon as possible. 
A very effective way to begin implementing a new sales technique is to first
rehearse the technique with a colleague — one of you plays the salesperson,
and the other pretends to be the buyer. Consider switching roles, so you each
have a chance to play salesperson and buyer. Some salespeople claim to
67
Chapter 4: Making Selling Your Hobby and Your Habit

learn more by playing the role of buyer. Keep in mind that mastering a new
technique may require several role-playing sessions and considerable prac-
tice to work out the bugs.
Some sales techniques require you to master subtle tactics. Consider hiring
someone who has mastered the technique to provide training, supervise role-
playing sessions, and offer expert feedback. 
Keeping Pace with Your Industry
A good salesperson can sell anything — cars, houses, insurance, video
games, computers, shoes, you name it. A power seller loves what she sells. I
sell houses, because I love the whole concept of homeownership — owning a
piece of land, taking pride in my neighborhood, being able to renovate my
home to suit my needs and tastes, and having an investment that gives me a
tax break. I wouldn’t buy a house from someone who didn’t own one or a car
from someone who didn’t drive. I believe that you should love what you sell.

The Mickey Mouse maneuver
In May of 2006, I flew to Virginia with my daugh-
ter Kolleen and my two assistants, Lois and
Kandra, to attend a Tom Antioch class on
Internet marketing. On the flight home, all of us
had seats in coach, and I decided to try to get
us upgraded to first class.
When we arrived at the ticket counter, I struck
up a conversation with the lady behind the
counter . . . okay, so my wife calls it flirting, but
that’s beside point, right? I noticed she had nails
that looked as though she were going to a ball
or a New Year’s eve party. I complimented her
on her nails, and she smiled. 
I then said, “Did your husband do that for you?”
She replied, “No, this is one of my luxuries. I
have my nails done every month.” 
I said “Awesome!” I paused a few seconds and
asked, “Are you a Mickey Mouse fan?”
She looked up at me and said, “How did you
know?!” 
I replied, “Because I’m a Mickey Mouse fan.” (I
didn’t tell her that I saw she was wearing a
Mickey Mouse watch.) My daughter had to turn
around to hide her laughter — she had seen me
work before. 
The lady behind the counter then said, “Mr.
Roberts, I have a critical problem. The plane is
really full, and it would help me if I could put you
and your daughter and assistants in first class.
Would that be okay?” 
And I said, “If that would help you and the air-
line, that would certainly be okay with us.” 
This opportunity came to me, because I
embraced the person behind the counter as a
real person. I engaged her in a conversation
and established a connection — a meaningful
relationship. Most people at airports are in such
a hurry and so frustrated and angry that they
overlook opportunities to connect with other
people. As a salesperson, you should always
connect.

Assuming you do love what you sell, my next bit of advice is something you
will have no trouble putting into practice — keep pace with your industry.
Subscribe to your industry’s top magazines, journals, and newsletters; book-
mark leading industry Web sites and visit them regularly; and share informa-
tion with others in the industry.
A great way to keep up on late-breaking industry news is to sign up for
Google News Alerts. Go to Google News at news.google.com, and then click
News Alerts in the navigation bar on the left and follow the instructions to
register and set up your alerts. You simply specify the news topics you want
to be notified of, and when a story that matches your description is pub-
lished, Google notifies you via e-mail.
By keeping up with the latest news and developments in your industry, you
become a much more valuable resource person for your customers and can
better understand their needs and the issues they face. In Chapter 18, I pro-
vide some additional suggestions on how to focus on your customers’ suc-
cess, which will drive your success to a higher level.
Keeping up on changes in the industry is much easier than having to catch
up later. Be proactive in gathering information. In highly competitive markets,
falling behind for even a short time can lead to disaster.
Practicing Your Sales Skills 
in Real-World Scenarios
You can apply sales skills to a host of different scenarios and situations,
because selling primarily consists of engaging people in a discussion and
then negotiating until you and the other party reach some agreement. 
When you decide to make selling your hobby, start practicing your sales
skills wherever and whenever you spy an opportunity. Sufficient practice
makes selling more instinctive and natural and places your prospective cus-
tomers at ease.
Effective selling requires an ability to adapt to different people and situations
quickly and smoothly. This ability to adapt is sometimes referred to as situa-
tional fluency. When you know your product and what the customer needs
and are comfortable with various sales techniques, you can customize your
sales presentation on-the-fly to maximize its effectiveness in any given situa-
tion. With situational fluency, you’re able to carry on a conversation with a
prospective client without feeling as though you’re pitching a product or serv-
ice. Some salespeople seem to be naturals, but most of us have to practice.
In the following sections, I reveal several situations in which you can practice
your sales skills without risking the loss of a sale.
69
Chapter 4: Making Selling Your Hobby and Your Habit

Negotiating in the office
Unless you’re acting as the salesperson for your own business, you have a
boss or supervisor who’s probably a pretty savvy salesperson. What better
person could you possibly find to sell something to? If you can sell to your
supervisor, you can probably sell to anyone. Following are some ways of
practicing your sales skills at the office:
 Negotiate a raise or a higher commission.
 Convince your supervisor to buy you a tool that can make you more 
productive.
 Request additional sales training.
 Negotiate an additional perk for the sales staff.
Sharpening your sales skills at home
Most marriage and family counselors essentially provide sales training to
their clients. They teach family members how to communicate more effec-
tively. Just like family, clients are much more receptive to what you have to
say if you first really listen to their needs and then address those needs.
Selling is all about guiding your clients to choose solutions that are best for
their situation. What better way to practice selling than in your family, where
you’re genuinely committed to guiding family members in making the right
choices? 
Another benefit of practicing your sales skills on a family member is that
your family is probably very sensitive to the feeling of being sold. If they feel
that you’re feeding them a sales pitch, they’re likely to call you on it.
Practicing with your family forces you to be more genuine.
Connecting with the restaurant staff
If you sell houses, cars, insurance, or something else that most people even-
tually need or want, I strongly recommend that you click into sales mode
every time you eat out. According to my estimates, everyone knows at least
250 people, so if you can establish a positive connection with your server,
you have an opportunity to sell to at least 250 more people.
70
Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 

The next time you go out to eat, commit yourself to selling to your server:
 Always greet the server with a smile and a compliment or some other
positive remark. I often say something like “How did we manage to get
the best server in the restaurant!” The server may have had a bad table
just before you walked in, so always be positive.
 After dinner, leave your business card behind with a positive note on it,
such as “Outstanding service and food!” If the service wasn’t all that
great, mention the food. If the food wasn’t great, mention the service.
 Don’t be chintzy on the tip. A 20 percent or better tip is the most memo-
rable compliment you can leave behind.
Even if you’re not selling something that everyone eventually needs or wants,
you can still practice your sales skills at the restaurant by engaging your
server in a conversation. Not only do get some additional practice under
your belt, but you make the entire dining experience more enjoyable for
everyone. Make it a habit.
Negotiating upgrades at the airport
I have so many frequent-flier miles racked up that I’m usually automatically
upgraded to first class, but prior to this, on about 80 percent of my flights,
I’ve been able to sell myself into a first-class seat. This is a great way to prac-
tice your sales skills.
When you arrive at the airport, you have three opportunities to negotiate a
first-class seat:
 At the curb: If you fly frequently, establish long-term, positive relation-
ships with the baggage handlers. Treat them with respect, get to know
them personally, and tip them very well. Over time, you’ll find that they
provide you with preferential treatment. When I pull up at the curb in
Detroit Metropolitan Airport, 100 people may be lined up to check their
bags. In most cases, a baggage handler who knows me takes me right to
the counter and tells the airline representative to “take care of my
friend.” If a first-class seat is available, I usually get it.
 At the ticket counter: Most travelers at the airport are pretty grumpy, so
be the one person who cheerfully greets the person behind the counter.
Offer a compliment. Strike up a conversation, and then look for an open-
ing to request an upgrade. 
 At the gate: If you couldn’t get an upgrade at the curb or the ticket
counter, you have two more chances at the gate. When you’re checking in,
engage the person behind the counter in a conversation. If that doesn’t
work, connect with a member of the crew or even the captain. People
often don’t realize that they can talk with the captain.

Engaging the taxi driver
To me, everyone I meet is a mini-marketing machine for Ralph R. Roberts, Inc.
Taxi drivers are no exception. They meet a lot of people in the course of the
day, and if they can drop my name or pass my card along to a potential client,
that’s free advertising for yours truly.
Engaging a taxi driver in a conversation also provides you with another
opportunity to ply your trade and generate ideas. After all, taxi drivers are
entrepreneurial — in a way, they’re salespeople. You may be able to pick up a
sales strategy from them or pass one along.
72

Selling taxi rides
I flew into Los Angeles and had booked a room
at the Ritz Carlton, Laguna, Niguel, about an
hour and fifteen minutes from the airport. On my
way to the hotel, I struck up a conversation with
the taxi driver. As usual, the driver asked me
what I did for a living, and I explained that I was
in sales — I sold houses. He asked me what he
could do to increase sales. He wanted to sell
more rides to the airport.
The first thing I told him to do was to have busi-
ness cards printed up with his cell phone
number on them, so people could call him
directly instead of having to call a dispatcher. I
jotted down his cell hone number, so I could call
him whenever I needed a ride during my eight-
day stay. 
I called the driver the next day. When he picked
me up, sure enough, he already had his busi-
ness cards. He asked me if I had any other sug-
gestions to boost his business. I noticed that he
had bucket seats in the front of the cab. I said,
“If I were you, I’d put a TV/VCR player between
the seats and play movies. Your passengers
could watch a movie on the drive from the air-
port to the hotel.”
He wasn’t too impressed with this suggestion.
He replied, “But the ride is only an hour and fif-
teen minutes. They’d only be able to watch half
the movie.”
“Exactly,” I said, “Then they’ll have to call you
for the ride back to the airport if they want to
see the second half of the movie!”
Months later, I called the taxi driver to see how
everything was working out for him. He was
now running his own limousine service in
Laguna.
This story doesn’t really show you how to hone
your sales skills over the duration of a taxi ride,
but it does demonstrate an important point
about sales — think creatively. By inventing
ways to better serve your clients, you’re one big
step closer to meeting your sales goals.

Setting the Stage for 
an Unlimited Upside

A
s an entrepreneurial salesperson, getting stuck in a dead-end job doesn’t
seem likely to happen. After all, when you’re earning commissions, 
you can earn as much as you’re willing to work, right? Well, maybe not.
Salespeople can still get stuck in dead-end jobs by boxing themselves in —
picking the wrong product or service, pursuing business from customers who
demand too much attention, working for an uninspired company, or refusing
to delegate tasks that others are perfectly capable of handling.
Limit your upside, and you can achieve only a limited level of success. It’s
like buying an eight-foot ladder when you own a two-story house. That ladder
isn’t going to get you on the roof. 
Maximize your upside and you discover unlimited opportunities. You can
continually expand and ramp up your efforts with additional resources 
and personnel. You never feel cramped, you always feel driven by a new 
challenge, and your dreams can become more and more expansive. 
In this chapter, I introduce the four main limitations to a salesperson’s upside
and then reveal strategies for overcoming these limitations and maximizing
your upside. Here you discover how to pick the right products or services to
sell, liberate yourself from lousy customers, break through limitations set by
your company, and hire assistants to improve your own productivity.

Grasping the Concept of Upside 
If you’re not quite sure what upside is all about, you’re not alone. Few sales-
people give it much thought, but it is something you should give careful 
consideration. Upside is simply your maximum potential. Think of it as an
impermeable ceiling that won’t budge. If you’re selling something that only 
a half dozen people in the world would ever really need or want, your upside
is pretty low. Sell something that everyone is in constant need of, like great
tasting fresh water, and your upside is pretty much whatever you decide it’s
going to be.
In sales, you want to maximize your upside, so you’re never at risk of hitting
into that ceiling. The upside should be sufficient to accommodate your
growth far into the future — ideally to the end of your career. You should
never feel as though you’ve achieved all that you could possibly achieve.
Spotting the Five Limitations to Upside
A limitation to upside is any bottleneck in your sales system that slows you
down and restricts your earnings potential. It can limit you from the supply
side or the demand side, from the bottom up (not having the resources or
personnel in place) or the top down (too narrow a market).
When you begin to feel as though something is holding you back, that some-
thing is likely a limitation to your upside, and the first step in removing that
limitation is to identify it. In the following sections, I describe the five types 
of limitations that may be holding you back.
74
Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 
Getting past the plateau
You reach plateaus in any challenging 
endeavor — physical training, a weight-loss
plan, marriage, your job, you name it. When
you’re dieting, for example, you may lose a sig-
nificant amount of weight and then, no matter
what you do, you can’t lose any more. 
My friend, Pete Thomas, “The Biggest Loser” on
NBC’s competitive weight-loss show and my per-
sonal weight-loss trainer, told me that to get past
the plateau, you have to “change it up.” As he
explains it, the body starts to lock calories in the
storage pantry when it senses that it’s being
starved. Pete told me that I had to occasionally eat
more so that my body would unlock the pantry.
The same is true in sales or any business ven-
ture. Once you’ve achieved a certain level of
success, you often have to “change it up” — try
something new, to start climbing to the next
level. When your sales career feels as though
it’s a job rather than a challenging career, it’s
probably high time to “change it up.”

Wrong product or service
You may be able to sell swimming pools in Alaska, but the effort is probably
not worth it, and you’re going to run out of customers pretty quickly. If possi-
ble, steer clear of products and services with a limited upside. Here are some
red flags to watch out for:
 Something you don’t like: Can you get excited about the product or 
service? If not, consider selling something else. If you’re selling a prod-
uct or service you don’t believe in and can’t get worked up about, then
your upside is going to be limited by your lack of enthusiasm.
 Fad item: Don’t jump on the bandwagon whenever any fad rolls into
town. Sales are likely to go from boom to bust in a hurry, and eventually
all the resources you invested in building a brand around that fad are
going to be wasted. However, be aware of the difference between a fad
(short term) and a trend (long term). Mistaking a trend for a fad could
keep you from capitalizing on a lucrative opportunity.
Don’t mistake a revolutionary change for a fad. Beanie Babies and pet rocks
were clearly fads, for example, but blogging is a revolutionary change that’s
here to stay. Meeting Richard Nacht from Blogging Systems has provided
opportunities that I couldn’t have imagined before the days of blogging. For
more about blogging, check out Chapter 17.
 Poor quality: A market always exists for second-rate products and serv-
ices at low prices, but selling shoddy products and services ultimately
harms your reputation, limiting your upside. 
 One-time purchases: Avoid selling anything that a person buys only once
during her life, such as cemetery plots. Houses, cars, candles, computer
software, and IT servers that have a three-year lifecycle are examples of
products that require renewal. You can afford to invest time and resources
in establishing long-term relationships with clients, because you know
that in the future, they’ll be in the market for another house, car, candle,
IT server, or whatever else they purchased from you.
 Saturated market: Some products are merely commodities, and compe-
tition in based solely on who can offer the lowest price. Competing on
low price may work for some mega-giant retailers, but it usually means
you’re scraping the bottom of the barrel. 
Wrong customer or client
If you operate in accordance with the credo that “the customer is always
right,” you’re making a big mistake. Customers are often wrong, and when 
a customer is wrong, serving them can quickly become a costly full-time
75
Chapter 5: Setting the Stage for an Unlimited Upside

operation. Unless you can settle them down in a hurry and get their expecta-
tions in line, your best move may be to cut them loose. 
Identify your worst customers and consider giving them less attention rather
than more attention (which they demand). I know it’s a little counterintuitive —
the squeaky wheel is supposed to get the oil, but in sales, pulling back from a
bad customer is a no-lose situation. The bad customer either goes elsewhere
(to burden your competition) or decides to cooperate and become a more
profitable and less burdensome source of revenue.
Use the following criteria to identify your worst customers:
 Doesn’t pay or doesn’t pay on time.
 Haggles over everything.
 Constantly complains.
 Badmouths you to other potential customers.
 Calls every 15 minutes.
 Distracts you from doing other dollar productive activities.
 Won’t listen to reason.
 Consistently late or shows up without an appointment.
To identify your best and worst customers, determine how profitable each
customer is. Gross sales is only one consideration. Also factor in the amount
of repeat business the customer represents, the amount of time the customer
requires, frequency and size of returns, payment issues, referrals you receive
from that customer, how your relationship with that customer affects your
status in the industry, and so on. Consider ranking customers and then work
on finding replacements for the customers at the bottom of your list. See
“Pursuing High-Quality Customers,” later in this chapter for details on finding
superior replacements.
Trust your instincts and act sooner rather than later. You can pretty much
sense when a customer is going to require more work than the relationship is
worth. No matter how hard you try, the results are going to be the same —
frustration. Instead of wasting your time, energy, and resources on a cus-
tomer, cut the cord. Let the customer cut his teeth on some other unfortu-
nate salesperson.
Another way to handle bad customers or those you simply don’t get along
with is to refer the customer to another salesperson in your office who’s
likely to be a better match. If you have a sales team, discuss troublesome
76
Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 

clients regularly and strategize on how to handle them. You may be able to
keep their business in the family while shedding yourself of a burden.
Even when you’re dealing with the worst customer in the world, remain
respectful and polite, and let the customer down easy. Remain professional 
at all times. When I tell a customer, “I’d love to have ten more customers like
you,” it’s a signal to my staff that this customer didn’t make the cut. When I
say, “I’d love to have ten thousand more customers like you,” everyone gets
on board. 
Wrong company or manager
If you’re not thriving in your current work environment, the reason may be
that it’s just not the right place for you. Perhaps you need a company that’s
more supportive or you simply need everyone to get out of your way, so you
can sell. Assess your current company, being particularly sensitive to these
warning signs:
 Lack of support: Ultimately, you’re responsible for procuring the tools,
materials, and assistance required to sell, but if you can’t obtain what
you need from the company and don’t have the capital to obtain them
on your own, you may be in a dead-end job.
 Lack of training: A sink-or-swim sales environment is perfect for sales-
people who prefer a hands-off management style, but if you require a
little more training, especially product training, and your company
refuses to provide it, you may be in the wrong place.
 Overbearing sales manager: Top-producing salespeople who are pro-
moted to sales managers make the worst managers about 99 percent of
the time. If your sales manager is obsessed with sales quotas, disregards
your opinions, berates you, or undermines your authority with cus-
tomers or clients, you either have to convince your manager to step
back or start looking for another job. 
Don’t quit your current position without careful deliberation. I coach many
salespeople who are disenchanted with their jobs simply because the grass
looks a little greener on the other side of the street. By implementing the
strategies I suggest throughout this book, you’re likely to discover that the
job, your company, and your supervisor weren’t the cause of your lackluster
sales. If you’re doing everything I recommend in this book, and your sales are
still less than stellar, then the company you work for (or its products or serv-
ices) may not be the right fit. If you decide to jump ship, check out “Finding a
Supportive Company,” later in this chapter, for criteria in selecting a com-
pany that treats its salespeople right.

Chapter 5: Setting the Stage for an Unlimited Upside

An I-can-do-it-all mentality
Salespeople tend to be control freaks, and I still have a little control freak in
me — okay, maybe a lot. Trying to do everything yourself, however, is a sure
way to cap any hoped-for increase in productivity.
Do the math. You’re only one person. You have 24 hours in a day and seven
days in a week. You can boost your productivity with software and other
tools, but time still limits how much you, yourself, can do. To dash those 
limitations, delegate less critical tasks to others. 
Later in this chapter, in the section “Delegating Time-Consuming Tasks,” I
show you how to increase productivity by outsourcing some of your work-
load. In Chapter 13, I provide additional guidance on how to assess your
needs and hire the right people.
Time constraints
People often blame time for their limitations. After all, every day has only 24
hours, and every week has only seven days. When you see time simply as a
single dimension, it can limit what you’re able to accomplish. Those who see
time as only one dimension in a multi-dimensional world, however, are able
to transcend time and reduce its effect as a limiting factor.
Your reality consists of several dimensions, including time, money, technol-
ogy, and human resources. By leveraging the power of technology, the talents
of others, and resources from other dimensions, you can blow the cap off of
your time limits. See “Expanding Time,” near the end of this chapter.
Finding the Right Product or Service 
The salability of some products boggles the mind. Who would ever think you
could sell bottled water in a country in which every building has a faucet or
drinking fountain? Yet, every year, Americans alone gulp down over 26 billion
liters of bottled water. Unlimited upside? Sure, everyone needs water, but still
it makes you wonder.
Bottled water aside, when you’re looking for ways to boost sales, product
selection has to factor in. If you’re selling a product that has a narrow appeal,
the market is saturated, or you’re simply facing superior competition, you
may be fighting a losing battle. Part of being a power seller is knowing how 
to pick a winner — a product or service with an unlimited upside. In the fol-
lowing sections, I reveal some guidelines for picking a more likely winner.
78
Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 

Listing products and services 
packed with potential
Before bringing a new product or service to market, successful companies
typically perform market research to determine the viability of the product.
They may research sales figures for other similar products, host focus
groups, test the market on a smaller scale, and so on.
Chances are good that if you’re selling for a fairly large company, they’ve
already performed the necessary research and are aware of the product’s
market potential. If you’re running your own business or trying to pick a 
company to work for that has products or services with the most potential,
make sure those products and services have the following qualities:
 Universal appeal: The larger the market, the bigger the upside. Focusing
on a niche market is fine, as long as that market has more consumers
than you can possibly reach in the course of your career.
 Opportunities for repeat sales: Anything that people buy more than 
a couple times over the course of their lives is a candidate, including
houses, cars, computers, phones, and, yes, bottled water. This allows
you to establish relationships with customers that lead to repeat busi-
ness, so you’re not constantly searching for new customers.
 Reliable consumer base: A reliable consumer base is one that’s not
likely to disappear after a short period of time. In other words, don’t
chase fads. The more reliable the consumer base, the longer you can
expect to be in the business of selling that product or service.
 Something you won’t tire of selling: I love selling houses and can’t
imagine ever tiring of the process of finding the right homes for families.
If you have to convince yourself that you like what you’re selling, you’re
probably selling the wrong thing.
Pick a product you can build a career around — houses, cars, computers,
productivity software, power tools, or something else that people are going
to always need. Becoming a power seller requires that you build a brand
identity. Even if you sell branded products, you still want your clients 
thinking about you as their go-to guy or gal who represents the company.
Whenever a customer thinks of the product you sell, she should immediately
think of you. I encourage you to pick a product with an unlimited and long-
term upside, so you don’t waste time building brand identity with a product
that’s destined to drop off the radar a few months or years down the road.
79
Chapter 5: Setting the Stage for an Unlimited Upside

Assessing multimedia marketing 
opportunities
Some products have limited media potential — they may play well in TV ads
but not in print or on the radio or they may play well in print but not transi-
tion to TV. You’re not likely to see a huge boost in sale by advertising a spe-
cialty software program on TV, for example. 
When looking for products and services with an unlimited upside, however,
lean toward those that you can advertise and market effectively in as many
media as possible — print, TV, radio, websites, blogs, direct mailings, email,
and so forth. With more ways to reach prospective customers, you have
more ways to expand your market.
Don’t forget that you’re a product, too. When I talk about looking for a prod-
uct that has unlimited media potential, that includes You, Inc. Having the
right face and presence for TV, a good voice for radio, and excellent multi-
media presentation skills to establish a Web presence are all excellent assets
for capitalizing on the multimedia marketplace. For techniques and tips on
how to fully exploit the multimedia marketplace, check out Chapter 16.
Spotting franchise opportunities
In some industries, “unlimited upside” may include franchise opportunities.
As an entrepreneurial salesperson, you may be able to create your own fran-
chise by hiring other salespeople to work under you, paying them a slightly
lower commission.
This approach, commonly referred to as network marketing or disparagingly
compared to pyramid schemes, has been employed successfully by Amway
and other companies for years. For about 20 years, I steered clear of network
marketing myself, because I didn’t want to look like one of those lowlifes who
was running a pyramid scheme.
Now, I think of network marketing a little differently. I’m a top producer in 
the real estate industry, and I can provide valuable guidance to younger, less-
experienced salespeople. They want to work for me, because they know they
can be more successful with the training I provide. I want them to work for
me, because they can assist me in selling more than I could sell on my own. 
I can set up a network in a minimal amount of time, and it requires very little
effort on my part to manage.
80
Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 

When salespeople criticize network marketing as simply being a type of pyra-
mid scheme, Tom Bagby asks them, “You mean like General Motors?” GM and
all other corporations are set up so that the top people earn the most money
from the labor of the employees. Network marketing isn’t much different, as
long as the company is on the level and is not simply out to rip people off.
Pursuing High-Quality Customers
Every salesperson has his share of high-maintenance customers. The
expense and aggravation of keeping them satisfied isn’t worth the revenue
they generate. These are the customers who are dragging you down.
Shedding yourself of the deadweights and removing these particular 
limitations to your upside is a “simple” three-step process:
1. Fire your worst customers.
2. Retain your best customers.
3. Find more best customers.
Identifying the qualities of good customers
Who qualifies as a best customer is up to you to decide. In the business
world, “best customer” usually equates with “most profitable” customer, but
profitability can be a little tough to pin down. When creating your list of cre-
dentials for a best customer, consider the following traits:
 Places you first: When the customer thinks of a product or service you
offer, she thinks of you first.
 Pays a fair price: Customers who value the product and service you
offer are willing to pay the going rate. Those who don’t value what you
have to offer are constantly low-balling you on price.
 Challenges you: When customers constantly raise the bar, requiring 
you to expand your knowledge, improve or add new skills, increase 
productivity, and so on, they’re improving your business.
 Allows you to do what you do well: Customers should know your 
business sufficiently to ask you to perform in areas where you excel
rather than pushing you into areas outside your realm of expertise.
 Exposes you to new opportunities: Your best customers are 
collaborators — people or companies with whom you develop 
mutually beneficial relationships. These customers steer business 
your way and may even offer some cross-marketing opportunities. I
value this quality more than any of the others.
81
Chapter 5: Setting the Stage for an Unlimited Upside

Discovering more best customers
When you have a favorite dish or dessert, you often want more of it. You
want to know the ingredients and how the chef prepared it, so you can make
it yourself and have it whenever you want. In sales, you want more customers
like your best customer, so single out your best customer and then find out
all the ingredients that make that customer your best: 
 Who your customer is: Who are you really selling to? The user of the
product or service or someone who sells to the user of the product or
service? In some cases, this isn’t as obvious as you may think, as shown
in the following sidebar “Know your client and what you’re selling.”
Once you’ve identified your customer, study the demographic — age,
sex, race or ethnicity, household income, geographical location, and so
on. Jot down anything else you can think of, particularly in respect to
what that customer needs most to be successful.
 What your customer does: Get to know what your customer does for 
a living, where she hangs out after work, other products she buys, and
so on. I’m not saying you should become a stalker, but gather as much
information about the customer you can, through normal conversations
and correspondence, to draw a detailed customer portrait. 
82
Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 
Know your client and what you’re selling
Recently, I was consulting with a top hair salon
owner about seizing additional opportunities. I
asked him who is best client was, and he singled
out his regulars — those who had and held their
appointments for many years. I disagreed. I told
him to look at it a different way. His clients were
actually the people on the floor who booked busi-
ness. Instead of focusing on pleasing the people
who walked through the doors for a manicure,
massage, or wash and cut, he needed to focus
on pleasing the hair stylists, manicurists, and
massage therapists. They needed to be happy
and growing in knowledge in order to properly
service their customers’ needs. 
Several years ago, I consulted with a publicly
traded submarine sandwich company that was
in trouble. They thought they were selling sand-
wiches, which they were, in a sense, but what
they were really selling were franchises. The
franchises were in the business of selling sand-
wiches. After I was able to convince them that
their real customer was the franchise owner,
they began to cater to the needs of the fran-
chise owners, who ultimately became more
successful. The submarine sandwich company
was able to transform itself from a publicly
traded company that was in trouble into a suc-
cessful company that ultimately went private. 
Sometimes, simply knowing who your cus-
tomers really are can revolutionize your sales
approach and lead to incredible success.

Brainstorm a list of the seven top sources for more customers who are like
your best customer. Perhaps targeting a certain geographical area would 
be best. If you met the person through an Internet promotion, that may be
where you want to focus your efforts. Think in terms of what you need to 
do to get more customers like this.
Getting more clients like your best clients often requires the assistance of
your best clients. In Chapter 21, I reveal one of my favorite techniques for
drumming up referrals from past clients — my Hour of Power. Don’t under-
estimate the value of your best past clients.
Acquiring Support and Resources
Ideally, you’re either self-employed or you work for a company that nurtures
an entrepreneurial mindset amongst its salespeople. Your company and man-
ager encourage you to set goals, establish your own sales plan and strategy,
and provide you with the resources required to put your plan into action. If
you find yourself in a less-than-ideal situation, you have several options:
 Equip yourself with the tools and resources you need. 
 Leave and find a company that’s a better match for you.
 Convince management to invest in your success.
Try the third (least drastic) option first. What do you have to lose? If you try
to convince management to open the vault and they say “No,” you haven’t lost
anything. The worst thing that can happen is that you get ugly about it and get
fired, in which case you lose a job with a company that didn’t support you. 
Now, how do you go about convincing management to get you what you need?
The best approach is to act as though you’re starting your own business and
trying to convince a bank executive to approve a small-business loan:
1. Draw up your sales plan, as discussed in Chapter 3.
2. Meet with your sales manager to review your plan, highlighting the
potential boost in sales and profits.
3. Provide your manager with an itemized list of tools, supplies, and
other resources required to properly execute your plan, along with 
an estimated total cost and ideas for implementing your plan. Include
enough supporting documentation to convince the person to say “Yes.”
It’s easier for them to agree if they can hear it, see it, and possibly test-
drive it. Show and tell all the way to close. 
83
Chapter 5: Setting the Stage for an Unlimited Upside

In most well-run companies, new sales associates receive plenty of training
and support. In situations in which the training and support are not provided,
they are usually readily available upon request. Don’t automatically assume
that your company is unsupportive just because management doesn’t take the
initiative to offer resources to you. You may simply need to ask.
Lois, my trusted advisor, was passing through the building and bumped into
a new sales agent who had been in the office periodically. He complained that
he was unable to get any “Ralph time.” She told him that she knew how to
remedy the situation. As soon as he started showing up at sales meetings,
showing up to training meetings, showing up to shadow Ralph, showing up
and acknowledging that he was ready, willing, and able to learn, he would
have Ralph time. Before you can expect to receive any additional support
from management, establish yourself as a talented and hard-working sales-
person. Nobody can support your efforts to improve sales if you’re not doing
your part.
If your supervisor shoots down your plan, do what you normally do when
you’re trying to sell something — head on up to the decision maker. The
higher you climb up the ladder in the business world, the more likely you are
to connect with someone who’s entrepreneurial by nature and values people
who have goals and plans. 
Here’s a tip for sales managers and supervisors — look for ways to make
your salespeople more productive. I had a great salesperson who had an
unreliable car and no sense of direction. She was constantly getting lost and
spending half the day trying to find out where she was and where she was
going. One day, she simply didn’t show up to a sales acquisitions meeting. I
found out that she was knocking on doors in a dangerous neighborhood. I
purchased a company car with a GPS service, and it made her twice as pro-
ductive. She still gets lost, but only when she tries to drive somewhere with-
out the assistance of the GPS system.
Delegating Time-Consuming Tasks
When I set a goal to sell 300 houses in a single year, I immediately realized
that I couldn’t do it on my own. The volume of phone calls alone would have
consumed the better part of each day. To achieve my stated goal, I had to
outsource the most time-consuming chores and focus on what I was really
good at — dealing directly with buyers and sellers. I decided to deal with
clients and hire others to answer the phones, shuffle papers, and tie up the
loose ends.
84
Part I: Mastering the Sales Success Mindset 

When considering limitations to their upside, many salespeople focus too much
on product and market limitations and completely overlook their own limita-
tions. They falsely assume that just because their job description includes a 
list of tasks, they’re personally responsible for performing those tasks.
You’re not responsible for doing everything. You’re responsible for making
sure everything gets done.
Your goal is to maximize your earnings potential. You do that by focusing on
the tasks you do best and that bring in the money and delegating any tasks
that meet one or more of the following conditions:
 Someone else can do it just as well for less money. If you earn $50 an
hour, don’t cut your grass if you can get it cut for $10 . . . unless, of
course, mowing the lawn is therapeutic.
 Someone else can do it better. 
 You don’t like doing it — it drains your energy and motivation.
I like to tell everyone that I put up the Christmas lights at my house. I truly
believe that I do it, but I don’t get on the ladder or string the lights. I write the
check. Okay, I don’t even do that — my wife writes the check, but because I
play a critical role in earning the money that results in having the lights hung,
I feel as though I’m the person who hung the lights. By the way, I also clean
the house. 
Expanding Time
People often cite time as a upside limiter, but it’s actually not. I’m no physi-
cist, but time isn’t as linear as most people think it is. Time is relative to how
much you get accomplished in that amount of time. If I can get twice as much
done in half the time it takes someone else, I’ve just expanded time by a
factor of four.
I discovered the power of expanding time fairly early in my career. As you
know by now, I sell the American dream of homeownership. At one point, I 
hit a sales plateau. I was selling more houses than anyone else I knew, but 
I wanted to sell even more, and there just wasn’t enough time in the day. 
So, I expanded time and decided to make every minute worth more money.
I began double-booking appointments. Instead of showing a home to one set
of buyers, I invited two sets of buyers to drive around with me and look at
houses at the same time. I loaded them into my Suburban and showed them
the same houses. I usually sold two houses on the same trip. 
85
Chapter 5: Setting the Stage for an Unlimited Upside

What if the two sets of buyers settled on the same house? It never happened.
As soon as one couple identified the house they liked, the other couple 
reinforced the sale. They would go on and on about what a great house it
really was and how the other couple had really discovered the perfect home.
They actually helped me sell the house!
After this accidental success, I took this approach to the next level. I went out
immediately and purchased a 16-passenger van. I figured if I could be so suc-
cessful with so little planning, just think what I could accomplish by putting
more effort and resources behind it.
We started marketing this new house-hunting approach, and people loved it.
House hunting became more of a pleasure trip for my clients — an opportu-
nity to socialize and gather input from other buyers. More and more couples
signed up. I was driving three or four or five families around at a time to look
at houses. As I traveled the area selling houses, I used the cellphone to call
back to the office to get the paperwork ready. On my best day, I actually sold
14 houses from the van. This became so successful that we eventually had
entire convoys out looking at homes. 
Then, we took the next step — we started marketing to real estate investors.
They would really get excited talking about the investment opportunities of
certain properties, swapping stories, talking shop, trading secrets. The best
day I ever had with an individual was nine houses, and this was to a guy who
was just getting started. Since then, he has started his own real estate com-
pany and is using many of the same techniques he picked up from me.
Whenever you feel as though your head is hitting the ceiling, identify what-
ever is holding you down, and then remove it. Think creatively to discover
ways to avoid limiting your upside. Don’t let anything hold you down.

S
elling is like ballroom dancing. To avoid stepping on your dance part-
ner’s toes, you learn the steps. You practice to get a feel for how your
partner moves and make your movements more natural and fluid. Assuming
you and your partner have mastered the steps and practiced sufficiently, you
move effortlessly and gracefully across the dance floor, never missing a beat.
Onlookers can’t tell who’s leading and who’s following.
Selling requires a very similar finesse. With selling, the dance steps are the
basic selling techniques you employ. Over time, you practice these tech-
niques until they become effortless and fluid. To avoid stepping on your cus-
tomer’s toes, you get a feel for your customer — what your customer needs
and how she goes about making a purchase decision. Done right, the process
of buying and selling takes on the appearance of a graceful dance. You take
the lead and guide your customer to making the right decision, but as you
interact, neither of you seems to be leading the other.
While this is certainly an overly romanticized description of the sales
process, it illustrates the three key factors for selling effectively:
 Knowing your customer
 Knowing how to sell
 Practicing, so selling becomes natural

In this chapter, I focus on the key factor of knowing your customer. I give you
an inside look at how customers generally go about making purchase deci-
sions, reveal several proven strategies that I’ve picked up over the course 
of my 30-plus years in sales, and show you how to practice your skills until
you’re the Fred Astaire or Ginger Rogers of sales. 
Knowing Why Buyers Buy
Knowing why people generally buy stuff — especially your stuff — can assist
you in making your customers more sensitive to their wants and needs. Until
you know what your prospective clients want or need, you are in no position
to sell them anything. All you can do is present the product and describe its
features. When you know what the client is looking for, however, then you
can pitch the product to their wants or needs and have a much more effective
presentation.
In the following sections, I reveal the seven key buyer motivations and 
then show you how to identify these motivations as they play out in the 
marketplace.
Identifying the seven buyer motivations
So, why do people buy stuff? I can come up with at least seven motivations.
In the following list, I describe these buyer motivations in greater detail:
 Need/Problem: Customers you contact may already be well aware that
they have a need or a problem, but many others are totally clueless.
Until your customer is aware of the problem and realizes that viable
solutions are available, she sees no need for the product or service
you’re selling. Early in the process, either through advertising or your
interview, raise your customer’s awareness of the problem and pique
her interest in seeking solutions. Only then are you prepared to lead
your customer through the process of analyzing available solutions.
 Greed: Numerous products and services are designed to assist people 
in making more money. If you’re in corporate sales, that’s pretty much
all you sell, because businesses are in the business of making money. If
what you’re selling can make people more productive, if it can boost rev-
enue or cut expenses, then you have a product you can sell by playing to
your customer’s desire to make money.

Part II: Pumping Up Your Sales Muscle 

For the health of your immortal soul, avoid becoming another late-night-TV
guru peddling get-rich-quick schemes. These crafty salespeople sell the
vision of future riches, more leisure time, and early retirement. 
 Fear: Fear sells. Some claim that fear sells better than sex, and they may
be right. Just think of all the advertising invested in marketing products
that protect us from real or perceived threats: Satellite communications
systems for cars, so drivers always have a lifeline, no matter where they
may end up; Home alarm systems to provide early warning of break-ins
or fire; Bottled water... because you never really know what’s in that tap
water; Duct tape and plastic sheeting in the event of a chemical weapons
attack; insurance; and so on. 
 Pleasure: If you’re selling in a feel-good industry, such as vacation
travel, spas, hobbies and handicrafts, or home décor, marketing to 
your customers’ pleasures is paramount. But even in industries in which
pleasure isn’t the central focus, you can often sell luxury-class items 
by focusing on the pleasure they’re likely to provide for the consumer.
When a customer is in the market for an $80,000 car, for example, she’s
wanting something more than a comfortable ride to work. If you want to
learn how to cater to pleasure, go to a boat show.
 Vanity: People not only want to feel good, they want to look good, and
they generally want other people to think they look good, too. Whether
you’re selling cosmetics, clothing, jewelry, accessories, hair care prod-
ucts, plastic surgery, or a host of other personal care products and serv-
ices your marketing and selling strategies need to target the customers’
need to look good.
 Impulse: People often buy stuff because everyone else is buying it.
Remember the poker chip craze around the turn of the century? You
don’t need to be a great salesperson to take advantage of a hot trend,
because people know what they want and often purchase impulsively.
Success depends more on distributing the product and placing it in 
high-profile locations to making the purchase more convenient.
 Fatigue: Pushy salespeople can be very successful simply by wearing
the customer down, but I discourage you from taking this approach. It
may work for a door-to-door salesperson who wanders from town to
town, but when you’re trying to build a reputation that secures you
future business, bully tactics are counterproductive.
Sure, you’re selling a product or service, but your customer buys to solve a
problem or meet a need. Early on, focus more on your customer and on iden-
tifying problems or needs.

Chapter 6: Getting in Step with Your Customer

Identifying motivations for buying 
your product or service
Selling requires an ability to get inside the head of your customer and figure
out why that person is likely to want or need the product you’re selling. Of
course, you don’t really know what motivates your customer to buy until he
tells you, but you can get a general idea by examining what your products
and services have to offer:
1. Jot down a list of products or services you’re selling. 
2. Next to each item, list all of the motivations that a customer may have
to purchase the product or service. You may find that the primary
motive is to solve a problem or alleviate a fear, but secondary motiva-
tions may also come into play.
3. Rank the motivations in order of strength. Which motivation is 
most common and likely to convince your customer to make a 
purchase decision?
4. Use the motivation rankings to assist your prospective customer in
making the right purchase decision. Read on for additional details on how
to assess a prospect’s needs and then pitch your products to those needs.

Picking up sales tricks from advertising
You can discover some great sales tricks by
analyzing TV commercials and checking out ads
in magazines. The next time you’re watching TV
or flipping through a magazine, pay close atten-
tion to the customer motivation the advertise-
ment targets — need, greed, fear, pleasure,
vanity, or impulse. A commercial for a new
toothpaste, for example, may boast that the
toothpaste reduces cavities, thus calling atten-
tion to a problem — cavities and dental bills.
Another toothpaste commercial may focus on
the product’s ability to whiten teeth — playing
on the customer’s vanity.
You’re likely to see commercials that call atten-
tion to common fears, as well — perhaps a
commercial for a financial company that makes
you wonder whether you’re going to have
enough money socked away for a comfortable
retirement or a commercial for a home alarm
system that automatically notifies the police
department of any break-ins. You’re sure to see
plenty of commercials that cater to greed, too,
especially those late-night infomercials.
You’re probably already targeting these same
buyer motivations when you make your sales
presentations, but by becoming more con-
sciously aware of them, you can become much
more effective at it.

Collaborating on the Purchase Decision
Regardless of what you’re selling and your customer’s possible motivation
for buying it, your customer follows a predictable pattern when making a pur-
chase decision. The more aware you are of this pattern, the more effective
you can be at teaming up with the customer to arrive at a mutually beneficial
purchase decision. Regardless of what your customer’s buying, she generally
takes the following four steps in making a purchase decision:
1. Identifies a problem or need, either on her own or with the assistance
of someone in marketing or sales . . . not necessarily you
2. Searches for and compares products or services that meet her needs
3. Compares prices of comparable products and services
4. Measures the risk of purchasing or not purchasing the product or 
service
Although customers often follow this step-by-step process in order, the deci-
sion process can take some rapid and unexpected turns, and the longer the
customer takes to decide, the more jumbled the steps become. After assess-
ing the risks of purchasing a product or service, for example, a customer may
decide not to purchase and skip back to Step 2 or 3, so be prepared to make
adjustments on the fly.
In the following sections, I describe each step in the purchase decision
process and highlight what you should be doing at each stage to guide your
customer in making the right decision.
Calling attention to the problem or need
As a salesperson, you essentially solve problems or serve people’s needs. In
most cases, however, your customer doesn’t even realize that he has a problem
or that the need exists. During this stage of the process, you’re assisting the
prospective client in identifying a need, and you can do it in either of two ways:
 Advertising: On its surface, advertising may appear to push a particular
product or service, but the underlying message of almost all advertise-
ments is that the customer has a need that’s not being sufficiently met.
 Interviewing: If you sell by contacting customers directly, your early
conversations are or should be centered on identifying your customer’s
needs or problems. In other words, you should be asking lots of ques-
tions directed at rooting out problems or needs that the prospect may
or may not be aware of.
93
Chapter 6: Getting in Step with Your Customer

Ask questions before pitching what you’re selling. You don’t know what your
customer needs or wants until that customer tells you, and once you know,
you can more effectively pitch your product or service to your customer’s
needs. The more excited you are about your product, the more you need to
avoid the temptation to start reciting a litany of product features. Early in the
buying process, your goal is to gather information and understand the cus-
tomer’s needs. See “Asking questions to draw out the information you need,”
later in this chapter for details.
Identifying possible solutions
To be the best salesperson you can be, stop selling. Don’t think of yourself as
a salesperson. Think of yourself more as a friend or colleague who’s helping
his buddy solve a problem. If your friend came to you with a problem, you’d
probably listen first to gather as much pertinent information as possible. 
You may even ask your friend whether she tried any solutions and, if she did,
what the results were. You probably wouldn’t simply dive in and start offer-
ing advice before you knew what was going on. (For more about the benefits
of asking questions, see “Asking questions to draw out the information you
need,” later in this chapter.
After you and your customer identify a problem or need (for ideas on how to
identify needs, see the section earlier in this chapter, “Spotting the problem
or need”), the next step is to analyze possible solutions. To team up with
your customer and identify the optimum solution, continue your interview —
ask questions and listen carefully. 
At this point, you should have identified the prospect’s wants or needs. Now
you can shift the interview to asking questions that identify possible solutions
and determine whether what you’re selling meets your customer’s needs:
 What do you do? Instead of launching into a long-winded description of
what your company does and what you have to offer, shift the focus to
the customer’s situation.
 How are you currently doing it? Your customer may already have a
system or products in place. By understanding the customer’s current
solution, you’re in a better position to demonstrate how your products
and services can better meet those needs. 
 What are you trying to do? Encourage your customer to present what
she thinks would be the ideal solution or at least her vision of the results
that would follow if the ideal solution were in place. The answer to the
first question “What do you do?” tells you where the customer is right
now, while the answer to this question tells you where the customer
wants to be tomorrow. 
94
Part II: Pumping Up Your Sales Muscle 

 What can I do for you? After you know where the customer is and
where the customer wants to be, this question flows naturally. You’re
essentially asking the customer, “How do you see me assisting you in
getting from point A to point B?”
You may need to reword these questions so they’re more applicable to what
you’re selling. I sell houses, for example, so instead of asking “What do you
do?” and “What are you trying to do?” I may ask, “Where do you live?” and
“Where do you want to live?” Someone selling computers may ask, “What do
you use your computer for now?” and “What do you think you’d like to be
able to do with your computer?”
Prospective customers often dismiss problems, convincing themselves that no
satisfactory solution exists or that the solution is too costly or time consuming
to pursue. When talking with the customer at this point, consider asking
whether she has considered or even tried other solutions. By discussing these
other solutions, you can get a better feel for what the customer doesn’t want.
Weighing costs and benefits
Knowing that a solution is available, customers proceed to analyze the costs —
more specifically, they analyze the costs versus the benefits. This is where the
scales begin to teeter-totter, and where sticker shock begins to set in on big-
ticket items or large-scale solutions.
At this stage in the decision-making process, you can be very successful by
focusing the customer’s attention on the consequences of not purchasing the
product or service. If you’re in corporate sales, for example, you may ask the
customer how a decision not to move forward is going to affect production or
plans for expansion. In real estate, you may ask a couple who’s thinking of
purchasing a more affordable house how much that’s going to save them in
the long run.
When customers are assessing the costs and benefits, remain in question mode.
Don’t simply point out the negative consequences. Ask questions that draw the
customer’s attention to the negative consequences of not moving forward. 
Second guessing the decision
After people decide to purchase something, especially an expensive some-
thing, they begin to have second thoughts. They start talking to colleagues,
relatives, friends, neighbors, their hairdresser, you name it. Maybe they don’t
really need it. Maybe they can get it cheaper somewhere else. Maybe the evil
salesperson is pulling a fast one over on them. Whatever the case, the cus-
tomer gets a case of what’s technically known as buyer’s remorse, or more
commonly as cold feet, and you’d better be ready with a pair of warm socks.
95
Chapter 6: Getting in Step with Your Customer

At this stage in the purchase decision process, you’re essentially addressing
customer concerns, fielding objections, and trying to keep the customer calm.
For instance, in my industry (real estate), the buyer is excited about the home
they just purchased. Then comes the home inspection. Many agents don’t
attend, which is a big mistake. The agent needs to be there to re-sell, confirm
that the buyer is making a great decision, and overcome any obstacles with
suggestions of how to resolve potentially deal-busting decisions.
In corporate sales, you also have to remain engaged with the prospect but for
different reasons, especially if your company follows the hunter-farmer sales
model — that is, the person who lands the deal (the hunter) is ultimately not
the person who services the account (the farmer). ). In this situation, the
hunter needs to continue to remain engaged with the client to ensure quality
service and continuity.
Your ultimate goal is not to sell but to assist the prospective client in choos-
ing the solution that’s the best fit for them, even if this means not getting the
sale. When you’re not selling for commissions or bonuses but to satisfy your
customers, you’re doing it right, and the commissions and bonuses start
flowing your way.
Brushing Up on a Few Power-Selling
Techniques
Some people seem to be born to sell. They have personality plus. Anyone
would buy anything they were selling. If you’re one of these people, lucky
you. You can safely skip this section and tend to other ways of increasing
your sales and revenue. 
For the rest of you who weren’t quite born to be salespeople, there’s still
hope. By acquiring a few basic skills along with some turbocharged tech-
niques described in the following sections, you can take your game to the
next level and begin selling like a seasoned pro.
Dealing with the decision maker
You can waste a lot of time and energy selling to people who don’t have the
power to make the final decision. This is a bigger problem in corporate sales,
where your initial contact is likely to be lower on the chain of command, but
you may also encounter this problem if you’re selling high-priced items to
couples, such as houses, cars, or insurance.
96
Part II: Pumping Up Your Sales Muscle 

Whenever you’re selling, sell to the decision maker; otherwise, you’re not
selling — you’re simply negotiating your way past the gatekeepers. In the fol-
lowing sections, I show you how to spot the decision maker and work your
way up to the person you should be selling to.
Spotting the decision maker
Assuming you catch sight of the decision maker, identifying her is fairly easy.
Look for the person who has the most power and control. When I’m dealing
with a couple, I find that the decision maker of the two typically exhibits the
following qualities: 
 Sits in the front seat when we go to look at houses.
 Speaks on behalf of the couple. (When you ask a question, the non-
decision maker looks at the decision maker.)
 Adjusts with the type of product they’re purchasing.
Even though you may be consciously pitching the product to the decision
maker, don’t make the non-decision makers feel like second-class citizens.
Treat everyone equally — not the same, but equally. Otherwise, you could
lose the sale.
In corporate sales, spotting the decision maker can be much more challeng-
ing, because that person may be hiding behind a host of other managers,
employees, voicemail, and e-mail. Once you find the person, however, the
signs of power are similar to those you observe when selling to couples or
families. The decision maker is the person that all other defer to.
Working your way to the decision maker
When you’re selling to companies, the path to the decision maker is likely to
be strewn with blockades and detours. In most cases, you first have to get
past the automated gatekeepers — voice mail, caller ID, and e-mail. Then, if
you’re lucky enough to contact an actual human being, you’re likely to find
that the person isn’t actually the decision maker. To take some shortcuts to
the decision maker in a business setting, consider the following tips:
 Find out how purchasing decisions are typically made in the industry
you’re working in. Do companies typically have a purchasing depart-
ment? Does the CEO or CFO make the purchasing decisions? Are deci-
sions handled by individual department heads?
 Explore the company’s Web site for any clues, looking for the names of
department heads and other managerial personnel.
97
Chapter 6: Getting in Step with Your Customer

 Use the time-crunch technique. When meeting with prospective clients
whom you suspect are not the decision makers, ask when they would
like to have this solution implemented. If they say something like “two
months,” you can follow up by saying, “Two months? That’s okay, but it’s
pretty aggressive. Who’s involved in the decision-making, so I can assist
you in meeting your timeline?”
 Network with current and former employees, customers, and suppliers of
the company. See if any or your contacts can personally introduce you to
the decision maker. See Chapter 14 for additional details on networking. 
 Introduce yourself to the receptionist and ask who’s in charge of (fill in the
blank)? Filling in the blank with the department you want to deal with; for
example, “Who’s in charge of IT?” or “Who’s in charge of printing?”
If you’re not talking to the decision maker, you should be working your way
up to that person. Don’t waste time pitching your products and services to
people who can’t decide to buy them. If you have a contact at the company
already, ask your contact to introduce you to Mr. and Ms. Decision Maker, so
your contact can advocate for your solution.
Mastering the meet and greet
Your first meeting with a prospective client can set the entire tone of your
relationship. Following are some guidelines to ensure that your relationship
has a positive start:
 When meeting the client at her home, knock on the front door instead of
ringing (just in case someone’s sleeping), and take your shoes off at the
front door.
 Shake hands and introduce yourself first. A firm, friendly handshake 
is best.
 Maintain eye contact without getting into a staring match.
 Pay attention to seating arrangements. When meeting a couple at their
home or apartment, I try to move them to the kitchen table. The living
room is for company; the kitchen is where friends and family typically
feel most comfortable. If meeting in a public place, try to arrange it so
that your back is facing a wall, so that you receive the full and undivided
attention of your clients.
 If the client offers you a non-alcoholic drink, accept it or ask for water.
 Some small talk can break the ice and establish you in the eyes of your
client as not only a salesperson but a human being, but don’t force it,
and always avoid discussing sex, politics, religion, or schools.

Energizing the conversation
No matter how badly your day has gone, how tired you feel, or how much
you’d rather be somewhere else, pump yourself up and pump some energy
into the conversation. 
I once had a reporter call for an interview on a very busy day when I had
barely a moment to breathe. She asked whether she could tape the interview.
I could have replied, “Sure, that’s fine,” but instead, I said, “Fire up your tape
recorder and let’s have some fun!” She laughed, and I could immediately feel
the energy rise in both of us. The interview continued at the higher level of
energy and resulted in a much more positive story.
By boosting the energy in the room, you put your client more at ease, jump-
start their positive thoughts, and improve your chances of achieving your
sales goal.
Asking questions to draw out 
the information you need 
Earlier in this chapter, in the section “Identifying possible solutions,” I
encourage you to ask questions in order to assess your customer’s needs.
Asking questions is a critical part of selling effectively, because it enables
your customer to feel more in control of making the purchase decision while
providing you with the information you need to guide your customer in the
right direction.
Realize, however, that all questions are not created equal. If you ask a yes/no
question, and the answer is “No,” the conversation is pretty much over. In the
following sections, I offer some suggestions on how to phrase your questions
in a way that keeps the conversation going and provides you with the infor-
mation you need.
When phrasing your questions, consider asking customers how they feel
about something rather than what they think about it. The purchase decision
is often an emotional choice, so knowing how your customer feels can give
you a better idea of what they really want.
Asking thought-provoking questions
The best questions are those that provoke thought and compel your customer
to offer up details rather than simply yes/no answers. These questions may
also demonstrate your understanding of the customer’s situation or business
and your genuine interest in discovering solutions that are best for them.
99
Chapter 6: Getting in Step with Your Customer

Following are some examples of improperly and properly phrased questions
that can guide you in formulating your own questions:
Poor: “Did you like the neighborhood where you’re living?” (Requires a
simple yes or no answer.)
Better: “What are some of the best things about the neighborhood where
you’re living?” (Makes the person think and offer details about what she’s
looking for in a neighborhood.)
Poor: “When do you think you’ll be ready to make a decision?” (Can be
answered with a simple response.)
Better: “What needs to happen for you to be prepared to make a 
decision?” (Requires that the person consider factors that go into 
the decision process rather than simply a timeframe.)
Poor: “Have you worked with any other service providers in the past?”
(Calls for a simple yes or no answer.)
Better: “What sorts of experiences have you had with other service
providers?” (Requests additional information about other service 
suppliers that can assist you in determining what the client needs.)
Answering a question with a question
Customers can trap you with their own targeted questions. If you’re not care-
ful, you can actually un-sell your product by giving the wrong answer. When
you’re not completely sure from the way a customer asks a question what
answer they’re looking for, consider answering the question with a question
of your own.
Buyers often ask me questions about houses, such as “How big is the yard?”
Without knowing whether they want a big yard or a small yard or even what
they consider big or small, I have only a 50/50 chance of giving the right
answer, so I ask my own question, “How big of a yard are you looking for?”
Once I have the answer, I can phrase my own answer more effectively. If they
want a big yard, I may say, “This house has one of the largest yards in the
neighborhood.” If they want something smaller, I can say, “The lot is pretty
average for this area.” Same lot, but I’m framing the customer’s perspective,
and perspective is reality.
Some prospects can be downright hostile when asking questions, so be pre-
pared to deflect as much of the hostility you can, remain calm, and turn
around the situation with logical answers and perhaps a touch of humor. You
can usually sense hostility when the prospect asks the same question over
and over again. Knowing your product and your industry is the best defense,
because it enables you to deliver logical answers. I like to add a little humor
to defuse the situation.
100
Part II: Pumping Up Your Sales Muscle 

Using yes/no questions tactically
You may be able to use yes/no questions, but I typically do this only spar-
ingly. For example, I may ask a series of very easy questions that I’m almost
certain my client is going to say “Yes” to, so I can get the client in the rhythm
of saying “Yes.” Then, I finish by asking for something I really want:
“Is it okay to put a For Sale sign on your front lawn?”
“Is it okay to schedule an open house.”
“Can we put a lockbox on your door, so other agents can show your
home to more buyers?”
“Can we add your house to multiple listing services to generate more
interest?”
After about 10 to 15 of these easy questions, then I present the contract the
homeowners can choose to sign to have me as their listing agent and say
something like, “Great, let’s get started. This is a listing contract . . .”
Ask little questions, listen carefully to the answers, ask more little questions,
listen, and you’re likely to get the order.
Mirroring your customer
Your customer is likely to feel more comfortable in your presence if he feels
that you’re on the same level with him. To evoke a sense of camaraderie in
my clients, I often use a technique called mirroring. If my client talks loud, I
raise my voice. If the client speaks softly I lower my voice. If my client prefers
talking on the phone over meeting in person, I make more phone calls than
visits. If my client seems a little timid, I tone down my presentation. 
Think of yourself as the host at a dinner party trying to make your guests feel
comfortable.
Looking for win-win opportunities
The more successful your customer is, the more successful you’re likely to
become, so throughout the decision-making process, your focus should be on
doing what’s best for the customer. What’s best for your customer is what’s
best for both of you. Strive to make transactions mutually beneficial.
If your product isn’t right for your customer or your customer can’t really
afford it, selling it to them anyway may book you one commission, but it’s
going to hurt you in the long run.
101
Chapter 6: Getting in Step with Your Customer

Changing “no” to “know”
Salespeople are no strangers to the word “no,” but when a customer says
“no” to me, I hear “know,” as in the customer doesn’t yet know enough to say
“yes.” If the customer really means “no,” then you should certainly back off,
thank the customer for her time, and move on. Customers often say “no,”
however, when they’re simply having second thoughts and require a little
additional information. Be patient and persistent.
Customers often turn most negative just prior to making a decision to make a
purchase — just before signing on the dotted line. Furthermore, when they’re
considering buying from one of several salespeople, they often become most
negative with the salesperson they’re most likely to purchase from. This is a
positive sign, so don’t lose the deal by getting discouraged and giving up.
Knowing when to stop
Some salespeople become so excited when the customer finally decides to
make the purchase, that they keep selling, going on and on about how happy
the customer is going to be, what a good decision she made, blah, blah, blah.
What they fail to realize is that this places them at an increased risk of losing
the sale.
When the customer has decided to make the purchase, whether it took you
20 minutes or 20 days to make the sale, stop selling and seal the deal.
Practicing Your Sales Presentation
A sales presentation is only as good as it is natural, and to make it natural
requires practice. Just think how stiff a group of actors would be staging a
play after only a few rehearsals. The more you practice, the smoother your
delivery and the better able you are to ad lib when your customer throws
you a curveball. 
Unfortunately, most of your practice in sales comes in the form of on-the-job
training — you fail your way forward. If you’re a quick learner, the pain is short-
lived, and you eventually reap the rewards of your sacrifice. To relieve some of
the pain and get you up to speed a little sooner, the following sections suggest
various ways to get much more out of your practice sessions on or off the job. 
In speaker circles, stage time is critical to honing your speaking skills. In
sales, the most important place to practice is in front of the customer. It’s no
secret — the more you do it, the better you get at it. Real sales experiences,
good or bad, make you a better salesperson.
102
Part II: Pumping Up Your Sales Muscle 

Role playing
Sales consultants often recommend role-playing with a colleague, which I
suppose can be of some use, but I’m not a big fan of role playing. You’re
better off practicing new skills in an actual sales setting with a real customer.
Having a more experienced colleague sit in on your presentation and provide
feedback afterward is an excellent idea, as I discuss later in this chapter in
the section, “Teaming up with a trainer.”
Watching and listening to yourself work
Athletes often watch tapes of themselves in action, to see what they’re doing
right, what they’re doing wrong, and what they can do better. In the midst of
competition, they have only a vague feeling of whether they’re doing every-
thing right. The video recording enables the athlete to take a more critical
view of her performance.
Try the same technique. Audiotape your presentation and listen to it later. 
If you hold sales presentations in your office, you may also consider video-
taping a few presentations and watching them later. By hearing and perhaps
listening to both yourself and your client, you can develop a clearer sense of
what you’re saying and the effect it has on a client. You can then “adjust your
swing” accordingly.
After a presentation, most salespeople have an overly negative view of 
their performance. They may have done quite well, but walk away feeling 
as though they “blew it.” Keep this in mind when you start to feel as though 
you blew a sale. You probably did much better than you think.
103
Chapter 6: Getting in Step with Your Customer
Avoiding the urge to become a clone
My resistance to role playing comes from my
own experience with it. Tom Hopkins, author of
Selling For Dummies, was one of my early sales
heroes. I did everything I could to look and act
more like Tommy Hopkins, so I could achieve a
similar level of success. After some time, I real-
ized that being a Tommy Hopkins clone wasn’t
working for me, and I needed to bring my own
personality into my presentations.
In Chapter 3, I encourage you to identify your
sales heroes, so you can develop a clearer
vision of the salesperson you want to be, but
avoid the temptation to model yourself too
closely after your hero. You have to own the
way you sell. Your approach must be true to
your personality and beliefs. Otherwise, cus-
tomers are going to perceive you as a phony.

Teaming up with a trainer
If you’re fortunate enough to work for a company that provides training for
its salespeople, take full advantage of the trainer. If you do most of your sales
over the phone, you may be able to record your sales calls (with the client’s
permission, of course), and then review those calls with your trainer to deter-
mine what you can do more effectively. If you meet clients in person, the
trainer may be able to sit in on the meeting and provide feedback later.
Former salespeople often make lousy trainers. They often have big egos
fueled by the belief that becoming manager was a huge promotion. They
can’t stop selling and insist on stepping in when they think you’re about to
lose a sale. These intrusive trainers can actually undermine your credibility
with a client. A good trainer remains as invisible as possible and provides
feedback to you later . . . in private. 
If your company doesn’t offer a trainer, consider asking a colleague you
admire to provide some coaching or going outside the company and hiring a
sales coach. A sales coach can often assist you in attaining both your profes-
sional and personal goals. One of the big things in my industry right now are
real estate agent teams. Team members often swap tips and techniques and
may even accompany one another on sales calls to pick up new strategies.

Teaming Up for Success with
Personal Partnering
In This Chapter
 Meeting personal partnering for the first time
 Assessing your current situation
 Developing a personal improvement plan
 Selecting a personal partner
 Celebrating your mutual success
You probably have one or two nagging goals — maybe to run a marathon,
learn a foreign language, or play a musical instrument. Perhaps you’ve
even tried a couple times to achieve that goal, but became distracted by
something that seemed more important at the time. Ten years later, you’re
kicking yourself for not following up. 
What if you had shared your goal with someone close? What if you told 
someone that two years from today, you were going to run a marathon or
strum a particular song on your guitar or spend a month in Costa Rica speak-
ing only Spanish? What if you had shared your plan for achieving that goal,
and told that person to hold you to it? What if both of you held each other
accountable for actively pursing your individual dreams? Both of you would
have significantly improved your chances of achieving your goals. This is
what personal partnering is all about. 
Perhaps you already practice personal partnering and aren’t even aware of it,
or maybe you call it something else, like the buddy system. If you’re a member
of a reading group, for example, you’re already involved in a basic form of
personal partnering. The group chooses a book to read and sets a date on
which to discuss the book. You feel responsible for getting that book read by
the specified date, so you can contribute something of value to the discus-
sion. Without some peer pressure, you’d have a much easier time blowing it
off, and you probably wouldn’t read nearly as much. 

In this chapter, I reveal the Personal Partnering Process — a personal change
technique developed by my friend and colleague Terry Wisner, Founder of
Partnering To Success, LLC. Terry has helped me modify the approach to
better assist salespeople in using it to effect positive changes in their careers.
Here you discover how to team up with your personal partner to prioritize
your goals, support one another’s efforts, and celebrate your achievements
on your way to mutual success.
Flagging Areas for Improvement
Like any serious effort to make a positive change in your life, changing the
way you sell begins with an honest assessment of your current skill set. Until
you admit that you could be doing something better and then identify that
something, you have no idea of what you need to work on.
Of course, assessing your sales skills sounds a lot easier than it really is. It
requires that you admit your own shortcomings and take a step back to see
yourself as others see you. In the following section, I show you how to gather
the information required to identify areas for improvement, or what I like to
refer to as lesser strengths.
Performing a self assessment
When trying to identify areas for improvement, start with yourself. What 
do you feel you could be doing or doing better to boost sales? You may, for
example, feel as though you’re not very good talking on the phone or maybe
you think you need to develop computer skills. Look for your lesser
strengths. The following list highlights some key areas to examine: 
 Communicating over the telephone
 Communicating in person
 Obtaining high-quality leads
 Improving efficiency through technology
 Meeting clients for the first time
 Asking for referrals
 Developing an product expertise
 Researching the competition
 Networking and building productive relationships
 Finding out more about your customers

Throughout this book, I reveal strategies, skills, and techniques that can
make you a more effective salesperson. As you discover new sales tools and
methods you’d like to try, add them to your list.
Taking a sales skills assessment test
A sales skills assessment tool or test can assist you in evaluating your knowl-
edge of the selling process and identifying your strengths and weaknesses. 
If your company doesn’t offer a skills assessment tool of its own, use your
favorite Internet search tool to look for “sales skills assessments.” Most of
the tools require that you complete a questionnaire online. The assessment
service analyzes your answers and delivers a report highlighting your
strengths and weaknesses.
I prefer assessment tools that offer what is called 360-degree feedback — 
perspectives from your customers, your peers, your boss, and yourself. You
recommend the raters you want to assess you, and the company gathers
information from these people. By seeing yourself from different perspec-
tives, you can build a skill set that enables you to improve relationships with
all of those who have a vested interest in your success. The Booth Company
at www.boothco.com offers several assessment programs.
Gathering insight from colleagues
If you work in proximity with other salespeople, they may witness your inter-
actions with clients, either over the phone or in person, and they usually
form an opinion of how you handle various situations. If they’re polite, they
may keep their comments to themselves, but keeping a secret doesn’t assist
you in identifying areas for improvement.
To break the ice, encourage your colleagues to open up by asking them to
provide you with honest feedback. Tell them that you’re trying to sharpen
your sales skills and that you would appreciate any insights or recommenda-
tions they have to offer. Maybe you sound a little too abrasive on the phone.
Perhaps you talk too much and listen too little. Whatever the case, these are
things you should be aware of.
Don’t kill the messenger. No matter how harsh the criticism, accept it without
holding a grudge against the person who offered it. The person who cares for
you is the one who tells you when you have something stuck in your teeth or
quietly slips you a breath mint when you really need it, not the person who
keeps it a secret.
107
Chapter 7: Teaming Up for Success with Personal Partnering

Collecting customer feedback
Customers see you as nobody else sees you — from the perspective of some-
one who’s going to purchase something from you. They can usually purchase
whatever they want from three or four other people, but they chose you (or
didn’t choose you) for some reason, and you should know why. And when
you want to know why, ask.
Whether someone chooses to buy from you or not, try to find out what went
into the purchase decision and how your sales presentation affected their deci-
sion. Avoid yes/no questions, such as, “Are you satisfied with the purchase?”
Instead, keep your questions open-ended to encourage customers to identify
areas for improvement. Following are some questions you may consider asking:
“What factors did you consider in making your purchase decision?”
“What made you decide to choose the product you chose?”
“What could I have done better?”
“Why did you choose to purchase from <the other company>?” 
Customers who are also in sales often provide the most insightful feedback.
Getting feedback from salespeople who buy your products is like getting
coaching from a professional golfer instead of some weekend duffer. Seek
feedback from those who are most qualified to give it.
Listening to the boss
The quality of feedback from a manager or supervisor can range from totally
clueless to remarkably perceptive, so I’m not about to tell you to blindly
follow your manager’s advice. You should, however, listen to what your man-
ager has to say . . . he could be right, particularly if you’ve heard the same
thing from someone else.
Your manager’s compensation is probably tied directly to the success of 
his sales force, so everyone’s best interest is served through collaboration.
Consider discussing your proposed personal improvement plan with your
boss before your annual review and requesting your manager’s support in
achieving your goals. 
Targeting Key Skills
People who achieve excellence in a particular field are those who act with a
singularity of purpose. They focus on a few things, or perhaps just one, and
108
Part II: Pumping Up Your Sales Muscle 

pour all of their energy and resources into achieving whatever they decide is
most important. In short, they know how to prioritize. 
You can work on identifying and prioritizing goals or areas of improvement
alone or with your partner. I find that spending some time alone makes the
time I spend with my personal partner that much more productive. If you’re
having trouble getting started, however, skip to the following section,
“Teaming Up with Your Personal Partner,” and find a partner first.
In Chapter 3, I lead you through the process of listing your goals, prioritizing,
and then drawing up a plan to achieve those goals. You can use those same
strategies to target the sales skills you want to work on first, but the personal
partnering process prescribes a slightly more specific approach:
1. List 100 (or so) sales skills you would like to sharpen. List as many as
you can think of.
2. Underline the top seven skills you feel are most valuable and in need of
development. If you had only a month to significantly boost sales, which
seven skills do you feel as though you would need the most work on?
3. Highlight one big thing on the list. You already know that if you try to do
too much, nothing gets done right, so pick one skill you want to focus on:
your product knowledge, computer knowledge, overall business knowl-
edge, competitive knowledge, listening skills, whatever. Pick only one! 
4. Pick a couple of easy things. These are skills you can acquire or
improve with much less effort, such as buying a Blackberry device,
sending thank-you notes or birthday cards to customers, or jotting 
down a to-do list first thing every morning. You get the idea . . . pick 
easy things you can do that will have a positive impact on your selling
skills. Achieving small goals keeps you engaged in the change process. 
5. Write it down. If you don’t write it down, it doesn’t get done, so develop
a plan and write it down. Chapter 3 discusses planning in greater detail.
Just make sure that your personal partnering plan is SMART:
• Specific: Provide enough detail to explain how the efforts will cul-
minate in the desired change.
• Measurable: Include intermittent goals, so you can track progress.
• Actionable: Specify tasks you’re going to accomplish and the steps
required to complete those tasks.
• Realistic: Set realistic objectives, to avoid frustration and disap-
pointment.
• Timed: Set deadlines for accomplishing each task and achieving
the planned objective.
109
Chapter 7: Teaming Up for Success with Personal Partnering

Balance is key to long-term success, so when you’re prioritizing your goals,
make sure they include your personal goals, as well. If you achieve your pro-
fessional goals without achieving your personal goals, or vice versa, you’re
likely to be disappointed overall, which is a sign that you’re not truly suc-
cessful. I could never have achieved the success I’ve experienced without
having a supportive family and a rewarding personal life. Balance enables you
to achieve your full potential in all areas of your life.
Teaming Up with Your Personal Partner
Personal partnering takes more than simply connecting with someone you
know, making a few promises, and then going your separate ways to pursue
your dreams. It requires that you work closely together, support one another,
and meet regularly to track progress and make any necessary adjustments.
You need to find a compatible partner, share your priorities and your plan,
set down the rules, and then team up to execute your plans.
The following sections show you how to locate a suitable partner and launch
your partnership in the right direction.

Personal partnering with my brother
One of my earliest personal partners was my
brother, David W. Roberts. We worked in real
estate together in Detroit, and he later moved
down to Florida. We made great partners,
because we were both highly motivated and
committed to one another’s success, and we
shared common interests and experiences, par-
ticularly in our professional lives — real estate.
Having someone who understood the business
and had experienced its ups and downs was a
real plus. 
Whenever we met, we discussed the books we
were reading, the marketing ideas we were work-
ing on, strategies we tried that failed and those
that worked, and the goals we had. We didn’t
share the exact, same goals, but we supported
one another. Each meeting was an occasion for
growth and development, and we have each man-
aged to achieve much more as a result.
David is now the most successful real estate
agent in all of Florida and possibly in the nation.
His sales exceeded $200 million dollars last year.
David has also achieved success as my personal
partner, encouraging and supporting me to
achieve higher and higher levels of success than
I could ever have achieved without him.
Look for opportunities to develop productive
partnerships in your own life. You may find the
perfect partner in a colleague, friend, neighbor,
sibling, or parent. The perfect partner could just
be the next person you meet.

Finding a good match
Personal partnering is effective with just about any two or three people who
are dedicated to one another’s success, but it works much better when you
share common interests and goals. Teaming up with someone in sales, who is
probably more aware of what you’re trying to accomplish and the challenges
you’re facing, is likely to be more productive than dealing with someone who
just doesn’t get it.
When you’re in the market for a personal partner, look for someone who fits
the following profile:
 A salesperson, ideally in the same or a related industry and with a skill
set comparable or superior to yours
 A goal setter who shares the goal of improving her skills and who would
like to see you become more successful
 A person you respect and who respects you
 A person you like and who likes you
 A person already with a plan or a willingness to develop such a plan
 An honest individual who won’t pull punches
Some of the most productive partnerships arise when partners have comple-
mentary skill set or resources. Star Power CEO Howard Brinton partners 
with Top Producing Agents (top-selling real estate agents). He acquires their
knowledge and shares it with the industry. The top producers get more
recognition and more referrals, and they become members of a community.
When you and your partner review one another’s lists, look for opportunities
to barter one another’s skills and resources.
As you gain success, more people are going to seek you out to establish part-
nerships. Be selective. Partnerships can end up becoming very lopsided.
Make sure you’re partnering with someone who has something of value to
bring to the table.
When choosing a personal partner, avoid the following:
 Clients or customers: Although you may have a productive client/server
relationship, adding a personal partnership could strain the relation-
ship, mixing personal matters with business.
 Competing coworkers: Internal competition in sales teams can often
create an environment in which personal partnering is not conducive. If
you find yourself in a situation such as this, consider looking for a partner
who sells in another district or region or for different company altogether.
111
Chapter 7: Teaming Up for Success with Personal Partnering

Although your partner should have a plan for improvement, you don’t neces-
sarily need to be working toward the same objective. What you’re striving 
for can be totally different. What’s important is that you and your partner
support one another in your efforts to improve. And you can do this in either
of two ways — through collaborative or cooperative partnering:
 Collaborative partnering: In a collaborative effort, partners share a
common goal. This is the most common arrangement for coworkers 
who are striving to achieve a common goal, such as host an event, 
build a Web site, or attend a conference together.
Working collaboratively does not necessarily mean that you and your
partner are performing the same tasks. If you’re attending a conference
together, for example, you may split up to maximize your networking
opportunities and attend different training sessions. If you’re hosting 
a promotional event, one of you may be working on invitations, while
another is lining up a caterer, and a third partner is developing market-
ing materials.
 Cooperative partnering: With cooperative partnering, partners don’t
share a common goal. Each partner is free to pursue her own goals but
is still accountable to her partner, and partners must encourage and
support one another in their individual pursuits. 
Sharing your priorities and plan
Sharing your priorities and your plan with your partner is the unveiling of your
vision for future success. Assuming you’re both passionate about the journey
you’re embarking on and believe in the plan you’re sharing with your personal
partner, your first meeting is likely to be positive and brimming with energy.
As you review one another’s plans, ask yourself and each other questions
designed to flesh out the plan and make it more concrete, such as the following:
 Why is this so important to me?
 What will happen if I don’t accomplish this?
 How will I know when I’ve met my goal?
 Who else, if anyone, needs to be involved?
 How are we going to celebrate after we both achieve our goals? As an
incentive to support one another, you celebrate only after you’ve both
achieved your goals. See “Celebrating your success,” later in this chap-
ter, for details. 
The idea here is to support and hold each other accountable to make the
planned improvements. Examine each other’s plan in as much detail as nec-
essary and ask additional questions to clarify key points. This feedback is
essential in both finalizing the plan and communicating it to your partner.
112
Part II: Pumping Up Your Sales Muscle 

Setting the ground rules
Although you can certainly formalize your personal partnering agreement by
drawing up a contract and signing it, you can forgo the formalities and take a
more casual approach, but you should always schedule a follow-up meeting
and have a plan for tracking one another’s progress. Specifically, you and your
partner should come to an agreement that lays out the following ground rules:
 Frequency of follow-up contacts
 Method of following up: in person, via phone, email
 Guidelines for judging success
 Rewards for achieving stated goals
 Consequences for not achieving stated goals
 The support role that each person must fill
For details about keeping in touch and providing the necessary support,
check out the next section, “Keeping each other on track.”
Support and encourage one other’s growth. Don’t criticize or ridicule. You
can’t force your partner to implement her plan. Your role is part cheerleader,
part taskmaster, and part facilitator. Your partner’s desire to achieve her
goals and to honor her commitment to you and to herself should be motiva-
tion enough to keep her on track.
Keeping each other on track
Personal partnering is effective only if you and your partner remain in con-
tact, communicate clearly, provide the necessary encouragement and sup-
port, and hold one another accountable. In the following sections, I step you
through the process of staying in touch and keeping one another on track.
What happens between you and your partner stays between you and your
partner. Sharing goals requires a certain level of intimacy and trust and 
may reveal some vulnerabilities. Discuss this issue with your partner and
commit to communicate in confidence. Don’t fall into the common trap of
being overly positive and constantly patting each other on the back. I tend to
gravitate toward the source of compliments, so I’ve surrounded myself with
people who don’t hesitate to tell the truth — my wife, Kathleen; my handler,
Lois; and my virtual assistant, Kandra.
Tracking progress
Staying on course is a lot easier than getting back on course after a long
detour, and the best way to stay on course is to follow up with your partner
113
Chapter 7: Teaming Up for Success with Personal Partnering

frequently, particularly early on. You can follow up with actual face-to-face
sessions, via telephone calls, through e-mails or instant messaging, or
through whatever other communication channels you have available. 
Follow-up schedules vary, depending on your and your partner’s preferences,
whether you’re in the initial stages of executing your plans, and the specific
tasks that your plans entail. If you plan on making one extra sales call per
day, for example, your partner may check your progress daily for the first
week, once a week for the next month, and then monthly for the rest of the
year. If your objective were to average 30 lead-generating phone calls per
month, you may consider scheduling feedback sessions on a weekly basis 
for the first month then monthly after that.
Time your feedback sessions to accommodate both your plan and your part-
ner’s plan. The goal is for both of you to succeed.
Providing BACKUP 
Throughout the personal partnering process, both you and your partner
need to support and encourage each other by offering BACKUP:
Be empathetic towards each other
Actively listen to one another
Constantly focus on the other’s goals
Keenly watch for non-verbal signals
Understand . . . you may not know everything
Pursue the other’s thoughts and feelings
114
Part II: Pumping Up Your Sales Muscle 
Collaborative competition
When you’re teaming up with a colleague to
achieve a goal, collaborative competition can
keep you both on track. Let’s say for example,
that you and your partner share the goal of
making ten additional cold calls per month. You
agree to keep each other posted of your weekly
progress. After three weeks, you both observe
the following pattern: 
Week 1 Extra Cold Calls: You 3, Partner 1
Week 2 Extra Cold Calls: You 3, Partner 0
Week 3 Extra Cold Calls: You 2, Partner 2
By the end of the third week, you have eight
new cold calls to your partner’s 3. Your partner,
who happens to be committed to your mutual
success, can plainly see that she needs to get
her booty in gear to meet her quota, and you
realize that you need to offer some support. At
this point, you may want to give your partner a
call and offer some tips on how you go about
generating cold calls.

Sharpening your listening skills
Listening to your partner isn’t like listening to background music. Give your
partner your full, undivided attention. Here are some tips for being a more
active listener: 
 Create a positive environment. Turn off cell phones and get away from
external distractions as much as possible.
 Ask first. By asking your partner to go first, you show that you’re 
genuinely interested in what they have to say, and it elicits the same
courtesy from your partner.
 Take brief notes. Just jot down key points and any questions you have.
 Listen attentively. Sit with your body relaxed and facing your partner
and establish eye contact.
 Communicate nonverbally, too. Use appropriate facial expressions to
indicate that you’re listening and hearing what your partner is saying. 
Be careful not to overdo it.
 Ask probing questions. Open-ended questions elicit more thought and
deeper connection within the discussion. They also reveal that you’re
interested in hearing more.
The ability to ask intelligent questions and process what the other person
has to say are critical sales skills. Use your feedback sessions with your part-
ner to practice these skills. Chapter 6 offers additional tips on asking your
customers questions. 
Reviewing, celebrating, and recycling
Party time! When your relationship with your partner culminates in some
level of mutual success, it’s time to review your overall performance, cele-
brate, and draw up plans to build on that success. The following sections
show you how to work on your endgame and enjoy the fruits of your labor. 
Reviewing your overall performance
As you execute your plans, you have many opportunities to review your
progress, and when you’re about to wrap it all up, you have one final oppor-
tunity to review your overall performance. At this stage, you and your part-
ner should sit down and run through the following questions:
 Did my objectives have enough stretch?
 Was I fully engaged in this change process?
 Did we meet our goals?
 What are some other self improvements I can make?
115
Chapter 7: Teaming Up for Success with Personal Partnering

 Could I have been more helpful to my partner?
 How helpful was the personal partnering process?
Take a few moments together and discuss your responses with your partner.
Try to quantify the results in numbers. Has this experience resulted in a
boost in sales volume? Has it increased gross sales or decreased expenses?
Has it improved your overall job satisfaction?
Building on past success
After you’ve wrapped up your review, jump back to the beginning of this
chapter and launch a new improvement plan right away. The success of 
your previous plan and the positive energy that flows from that success is
just the momentum required to make self-improvement a habit rather than 
a one-time event. 
Share personal partnering with your friends and family. Parents can partner
with their children to live healthier, more fulfilling lives. Couples can partner
to achieve their financial goals. Friends can partner to diet and exercise or
save up for a fun trip. Personal partnering is designed to make all aspects of
your life more enjoyable and rewarding.
Celebrating your success
Okay, here’s the fun part. During the planning phase, you and your partner
must plan for at least one victory celebration to take place when you both
achieve your goals. Following are some suggestions:
 Dinner at a fine restaurant
 Trip to the spa
 Weekend fishing trip
 Day at the races
 Shopping spree
Team up with your partner to plan a celebration suitable for the success
you’ve both achieved, and don’t worry too much about the expense — your
future success will more than pay for it.

Chapter 8
Embracing Change as a
Growth Strategy 
In This Chapter 
 Adjusting to changes in the way customers shop 
 Tuning in to what’s happening in your industry 
 Taking the lead to improve products and service 
 Shifting your strategy to seize fresh opportunities 
T
he old saying, “The only constant is change,” has never been more true.
The rate of change is accelerating at a phenomenal rate of speed, fueled
primarily by technology but also by the age of ideas and information. Each
day delivers innovations in products and services, how they’re marketed,
where they’re sold, how they’re paid for, and how they’re used. Changes 
in technology, society, politics, and other areas have revolutionized every-
thing from what we eat and where we eat it to how we elect our political 
representatives. These same changes have probably already influenced the
way you sell. 
When change occurs, you essentially have three options: resist it, accept it, or
seize it. Resisting a positive change typically results in falling victim to it. As
soon as your competitors implement the change, you lose ground. Accepting
the change keeps you in the running. Seizing the change and making it work to
your advantage enables you to reap its full benefits and grow both personally
and professionally. 
In this chapter, I encourage you to embrace change as a growth strategy. I
show you various ways to keep up on changes in your industry and changes
outside your industry that affect the way customers shop for products and
services. With the information in this chapter and the right attitude, you’re
well positioned to ride the next big wave of change to the shores of success. 

Working On Your Business
Capitalizing on change often hinges on how well prepared you are when
change and its twin sibling, opportunity, come your way, but many salespeo-
ple are so busy working in their business that they forget to work on their
business. They’re too busy trying to earn a living or make a sale and earn
that next commission that they don’t invest the time required to make their
business more successful. You have to think, anticipate change, plan ahead.
Joseph Kennedy Senior purchased thousands of acres of land surrounding
the oil fields of his days. Everyone knew that there was oil on the land, but
they thought it was too deep for the oil rigs of the day. He bought it up for
cents on the dollar because everyone else saw it as worthless. Joe Kennedy
believed that American ingenuity would eventually produce an oil drill that
could dig deep enough to tap into those fields. Obviously he was right.
You need to develop the same foresight and belief in the future that Joe
Kennedy exhibited with his investments in those oil fields. Be willing to take a
risk. Otherwise, you will spend your entire life scrambling for the next sale.
Get involved with the industry leaders, so you know what’s coming around
the bend and can remain on the leading, bleeding edge. 
Keeping an Eye on How Customers Buy 
Top producing salespeople seem to have a knack for staying one step ahead
of their customers. When retail shoppers started flocking to the Internet, the
most successful retailers were already there. The next tier of successful
retailers got there in a hurry. The few who resisted the change are still suffer-
ing the consequences, if they’re not already out of business. 
Of course, not every fad turns into a trend and eventually becomes tradition.
Some fads simply fade. Remaining on top, however, requires that you tune
yourself in to your customers’ needs and how they research and ultimately
purchase the products and services you sell. Use the following sections to
get yourself geared up for changes in the ways that your customers find and
buy your products and services.
Getting a handle on the basics
Effective marketing and selling requires a coordinated effort that communi-
cates to the buyer throughout the entire purchase-decision cycle. As explained
118
Part II: Pumping Up Your Sales Muscle 

in Chapter 6, a buyer typically takes the following four steps when deciding to
purchase a product or service: 
1. Identify a problem or need. 
2. Search for products or services. 
3. Compare prices. 
4. Measure the risk of purchasing or not purchasing. 
These steps rarely occur in a single place over a set period of time. A con-
sumer may view a television commercial for toothpaste, for example,
research different brands of toothpaste on the Internet, and then compare
prices and other products at the grocery or pharmacy before ultimately
deciding to purchase a specific product.
Asking the right questions
To create an effective selling strategy, you need to identify the various ways
that your customers arrive at a purchase decision and then develop a well-
coordinated marketing and selling strategy that communicates your message
to the customer at every step in the decision-making process. To get started,
answer the following questions: 
 Where is my customer likely to first discover the problem or need?
Pharmaceutical companies market in doctors’ offices and medical facili-
ties where customers are likely to hear first about a problem. They also
market on television and magazines to people who may have been diag-
nosed but are unaware of new treatment options. In some cases, you
may be the person who first reveals the customer’s problem or need. 
 Where is my customer likely to search for additional information?
The world is packed with resources for assisting people with their pur-
chase decisions — magazine articles, Web sites, product comparison
charts, store clerks, and so on. Identify the top sources that customers
turn to when making a purchase decision, and make sure you have some
input in what the sources say about your products and services. 
 Where can my customer go to check prices? You should have a pretty
clear idea of what your competition is charging and what they’re offering
at that price, but you should also know where your customers go to
check prices. Do they compare prices online or at the store? Do they
usually just ask you? Know where they’re going to check prices and
make sure your prices are included. If you’re charging a little more,
explain why. If you offer something extra, say so. 
119
Chapter 8: Embracing Change as a Growth Strategy

 When customers have doubts about purchasing or not purchasing the
product, where can they find assistance in resolving those doubts?
The final stages of the purchase decision are critical, and you want to be
there when the customer is wringing her hands. Unfortunately, this is
the time in major purchase decisions when friends and relatives com-
monly get involved and raise the prospective buyer’s level of doubt.
Keeping in touch with the customer during this time is key to closing the
sale. Contacting the customer via phone or e-mail is often best, but if
your customers commonly seek reassurance elsewhere, find out where
and establish a presence there, if possible.

Following the Sears lead
The story of the Sears, Roebuck & Company pro-
vides a perfect example of how a company man-
aged to make successful transitions to adapt to
its customers’ changing shopping habits.
Sears started out as a mail-order catalog com-
pany in the early 1890s, when Richard Sears
decided to launch his own mail-order company,
selling mostly watches and jewelry. At the time,
most people in the United States (38 states at
the time), were shopping at local general stores
and paying steep prices for merchandise. Sears
figured he could compete with these stores
nationally without having to set up his own
stores all across the nation.
In 1893, Sears met Alva Roebuck and they teamed
up to establish Sears, Roebuck & Company. By
1894, they had a 322-page catalog and were sell-
ing a wide selection of merchandise, including
bicycles, sewing machines, and sporting goods.
By 1908, Sears was even selling mail-order
homes — complete kits for building your own
home. They actually sold over 100,000 homes by
1940, when they stopped selling the kits.
In 1925, Sears opened its first department store.
Ironically, Sears started as a mail-order catalog
store to compete with local stores and was now
opening local stores of its own! Marketing
itself to America as the working man’s place to
shop, Sears department stores became hugely
successful.
After many years of expansion and diversifica-
tion, Sears hit some hard times in the 1980s and
’90s and nearly closed under bankruptcy.
Everyone was migrating from shopping at depart-
ment stores to shopping in specialty stores. This
was the era of the gourmet of products. 
In 1993, Sears started to turn it around. They real-
ized that they were known primarily for their
quality Craftsman tools and that people were
beginning to forget about all of the other mer-
chandise they carried, including kitchen appli-
ances, jewelry, and apparel. To attract the
customers they lost, Sears launched one of its
most successful ad campaigns ever, inviting cus-
tomers to “Come see the softer side of Sears.”
In 2004, Ty Pennington joined forces with Sears,
adding his flair for style and design. Pennington
and Sears leveraged the power of the multime-
dia marketplace and tapped into the popularity
of reality TV with the show Extreme Home
Makeover. With more and more women becom-
ing do-it-yourselfers and the engaging person-
ality of Ty Pennington, Sears was again able to
increase its market appeal, this time showing
people shopping at Sears for products and
using Craftsmen tools.
By remaining sensitive to the way its customers
were shopping and even where they were
being introduced to new products and brands,
Sears was able to stage a comeback in a very
competitive retail market.

Staying on top of changes
The way customers buy changes over time. Twenty years ago, nobody would
ever have considered purchasing beer through the mail, but thousands of
beer lovers are now beer-of-the-month subscribers who can go online to
select the brands they want to try. Home buyers are spending more time
researching homes on the Internet. People may even discover a new product
by purchasing some totally unrelated other product. You can stay on top of
these changes by working ahead of your customer — check out the following
ideas to get started:
 Use references and testimonials. References or testimonials from other
customers can often assist you when customers have doubts about pur-
chasing or not purchasing products or whether to purchase from you or
someone else. The more you can do to establish trust throughout the
purchase decision-making process, the less likely your customer is going
to bail out at the last minute. 
 Just ask! Don’t hesitate to ask customers how they found out about you
and how they ultimately decided to purchase a product from you. When
you notice a change in the way your customers shop, be prepared to
change the way you sell. Every change you make is an opportunity for
growth . . . a way to sell more effectively and gain a competitive edge. 
Changing the Way Customers Buy 
As new ways of shopping and gathering information become available, cus-
tomers naturally adapt to the methods and tools that make the purchase
experience faster, easier, and more enjoyable. As a salesperson, you have to
adapt to remain in sync with your customers, but this is a more reactive
approach to dealing with the ever-changing market. 
You can also choose to become more proactive by introducing new ways of
marketing and selling your products that make the purchase experience faster,
easier, and more enjoyable. In the following sections, I show you how to
become a more innovative sales person and create a unique buying experience
for your customers that can perhaps lead to additional revenue-generating
opportunities. 
Looking for cross-selling opportunities
In the late 1970s along with buying and selling real estate and owning my
sports bar, I decided to open an arcade. A building next door to my bar
121
Chapter 8: Embracing Change as a Growth Strategy

became available. I bought it and installed video games. I was amazed at the
number of kids who streamed into and out of the building . . . and at the
number of quarters that rolled my way. I had quarters galore.
Business was so good that when another nearby building became available,
right behind the arcade, we bought it and opened up a hand car wash.
Parents could eat lunch at the sports bar and kids could hang out at the
arcade while the family’s car was being cleaned. We took $20 customers and
turned them into $75-to-$100 customers simply by increasing the number of
services we were offering. Now it’s called cross-selling. Back then I was just
trying to stay ahead.
Cross-selling provides you with a great opportunity to stay ahead of your cus-
tomers just by anticipating needs that can coincide with what you already
provide. To begin thinking of ways to add products or services to your cur-
rent lineup, start by asking yourself these questions:
 What other products and services do these customers enjoy that com-
pliment what I already provide? For instance, if you own a coffee shop,
it makes sense to sell some baked goods alongside a cuppa joe.
 What other products and services do customers enjoy that fits their
needs while they’re shopping with me or taking advantage of my serv-
ices? Okay, two words here: vending machines. When you’re at a hotel,
waiting for an oil change, or at work, you often overpay for cans of sodas
or bags of chips because they’re conveniently located nearby. Discover
your own rendition of a vending machine.
 How can I make my customers’ experience with me easier? Several
grocery stores have carts that you can pile a entire gaggle of youngsters
into, but the smart ones charge money for use of grocery carts that look
like cars, animals, and other shapes that play cartoons while you shop.
A grocery cart isn’t a product or service you normally purchase at a
grocery store, but some creative thinking by grocery store chains made
the connection that people would not only pay for use of the cart but
would also likely shop for more because the kids would be occupied —
double bonus!
 What products or services can enhance the use of the product or serv-
ice my customer just bought or uses regularly? An obvious example of
this would be a warranty. Warranties cost a little extra but give cus-
tomers the peace of mind that they have recourse if something goes
wrong, but it also shows them you’re confident in the workmanship of
your product or service.
 What services or products do my customers often use immediately
after using my products or services? A business that creates marketing
materials for businesses within its area can add a courier service to its
line of services, making some extra money every time those materials
have to be delivered to local businesses . . . don’t forget rush charges!

Identifying new selling methods 
In Chapter 5, I tell a story of how I invented a new way of selling homes.
Facing what I believed to be a major obstacle standing in the way of my goal
to sell more than 300 homes in a single year, I was struck by the idea to show
homes to more than one set of buyers at a time. My invention was a resound-
ing success with many, although certainly not all, of my clients. 
Innovations are often born from problems — as the saying goes, “Necessity is
the mother of invention.” Use some standard problem-solving strategies to
start generating ideas: 
1. Jot down a list of problems that you believe are preventing you from
reaching you sales goals. 
2. Jot down a list of customer complaints and suggestions. As I explain in
Chapter 18, your customers’ problems are your problems. Any problem
is fair game, whether you think it’s getting in the way of increased sales
or not. You never know where your inspiration is going to come from. 
3. Arrange your list of problems in order from most serious to least seri-
ous, and then pick the top five. 
4. Brainstorm solutions to the selected problems. 
5. Pick the top solutions for each problem and begin to implement them. 
Far too many salespeople trip on the last step. They come up with brilliant
ideas on how to make the purchase process easier and more enjoyable for
their clients, and that’s the end of it. Put your ideas into action. 
When you’re trying to invent new ways to sell, think less about the end result
(increased sales) and more about the buying experience. Ask yourself what
you could possibly do to make the experience more valuable and memorable
for your customer. 
Identifying revenue-generating 
opportunities 
New ways to sell don’t have to cost you more money. Some innovations 
can actually save you time and money or even lead to additional revenue-
generating opportunities. 
You may notice several businesses that are actually two or more businesses
combined. Auto supply stores, for example, often have a service department.
They know that many prospective customers aren’t qualified to work on their
123
Chapter 8: Embracing Change as a Growth Strategy

own cars. By adding a service department, they can sell more parts and sup-
plies, and the parts and supplies store can refer more customers to the serv-
ice department. 
A few years ago, a major computer and appliance store added onsite com-
puter technical support as one of its services. Management realized that cus-
tomers often had problems with the computer equipment they purchased
and were reluctant to bring the equipment in for service. By adding onsite
technical support, which customers were willing to pay for, the store solved
a major headache for customers while adding a second revenue stream. 
Don’t give away valuable services unless you absolutely have to. If your
customers are willing to pay a little extra for education, training, superior
customer support, or any other services you can offer, use your ideas to
generate additional revenue streams. 
Prepping your customers
for the coming changes 
Your customers may not appreciate some of the changes you try to imple-
ment, especially if they’re stuck in their old ways of doing business, but if the
change you’re promoting is truly better for your customers, it’s a change
worth fighting for, and the best time to fight is before the fight even starts. 
Before implementing some radical change in the way customers shop or buy,
get some buy-in: 
 Float the idea past a few customers to see what they think. You may be
able to improve on the idea. 
 Take it for a test-drive. Don’t unleash your idea on all of your customers at
once. Test it on a select group of customers and work out the bugs first. 
 Keep your customers posted. If you’re not sure how your customers are
going to react, prepare them in advance to avoid the shock. If you’re sure
that your customers are going to love it, a little shock can be a good thing. 
Serving the savvy consumer
Real estate agents have relied on the MLS (Multiple Listing Service) for years.
The MLS contains descriptions of all the properties listed through real estate
agents. Buyer’s agents can read through the listings to find homes that may
appeal to their clients. Early in my career, we used thick MLS books . . weekly
publications. They were supposed to be confidential, but most of the top
agents bought several copies and passed them around to clients.
124
Part II: Pumping Up Your Sales Muscle 

Next came “Boris,” an MLS that distributed listings over the phone lines. It was
sort of like a fax or teletype machine. You could request the information you
wanted. The Internet followed, allowing agents or members to access the infor-
mation. Now, just about anyone can go on the Internet, find homes for sale, and
compare prices. Check out HurryHome.com to see exactly what I mean.
Today’s consumer is a new breed. The average consumer is tech savvy, well-
informed, and pretty good at tracking down information. To serve today’s
consumer, you’d better know your stuff. Phony sales pitches and fluff no
longer work. Provide the information and resources your customer needs to
make a well-informed purchase decision and back it up with impeccable cus-
tomer service after the sale. 
Tweaking Your Current Marketing
and Sales Strategy 
You can always achieve a higher level of success, but not if you stick with the
status quo. Top producing salespeople are constantly tweaking their packag-
ing, marketing, advertising, and sales presentations to experiment with what
they hope are more productive methods. Even a subtle change can dramati-
cally boost sales. 
125
Chapter 8: Embracing Change as a Growth Strategy
Spotting golden opportunities
When I was younger and first starting out in my
real estate career, I found that first-time home
buyers were a good match for me. I genuinely
enjoyed showing them houses, teaching them
the basics, and assisting them in overcoming all
the obstacles to buying their first home.
I advertised in print, and those advertisements
were fairly productive, but I needed a way to
establish direct contact with first-time buyers.
After wracking my brain for several months, I
realized that the one thing first-time home
buyers needed more than anything else was
education. They needed to understand the
process of buying a home and financing their
purchase (qualifying for a mortgage loan). 
I decided to hold a seminar for first-time home
buyers called “How to Buy a Home with Little or
No Money Down.” I hosted a few, small semi-
nars at first, to gauge people’s interest, and I
realized that I could go much bigger with it.
I contacted a local mortgage company, title
company, and home inspection company to
sponsor the event, and they even assisted me in
recruiting people to fill the seats. I hired
Ticketmaster to sell tickets. All of these compa-
nies lent support and credibility. I did press
releases and contacted the media. I sent flyers
to apartment complexes to encourage tenants
to think about their future. The tickets sold for
$29 in advance and $39 at the door. Over 1,000
people showed up to that seminar. I didn’t make
a boatload of money, but many of those atten-
dees turned into future clients.

In the following sections, you discover how to ruthlessly evaluate your sales
strategies and techniques, toss everything that’s not working, and experi-
ment with other strategies and techniques that hold more promise. 
Although you may have to drop everything you’re doing and change direction
180 degrees, give it careful consideration before moving forward. Changing
course a couple degrees at a time can revolutionize the way you sell over the
course of your career. 
Keeping score: What works? 
What doesn’t? 
Refrigerator magnets. I tried those. So did every real estate agent I ever met.
Real estate agents are still giving those away in the hopes that they gain a
coveted high-profile spot on every refrigerator in the neighborhood.
Unfortunately, I didn’t see much of a lift in sales after passing out all those
magnets. I tried the personalized pens, too, with similar results. Sometimes,
I found myself using another real estate agent’s pen to sign the papers for a
house I sold. 
126

Sales extinction exhibit
With all of the products and sales methods that
have fallen by the wayside, you could almost
start your own sales museum, complete with a
huge extinction exhibit. Following are some of
the items I would consider including:
 The door-to-door salesman . . . made extinct
by the Home Shopping Network and the
Internet. Who would have ever thought that
you could tune into your TV to watch prod-
uct demonstrations and or order products
online and have them shipped right to your
house?
 The milkman . . . made extinct by conven-
ience stores and groceries and the prolifer-
ation of multicar households.
 Telemarketers . . . not extinct yet, but the
national do-not-call list has certainly put a
dent in the population.
 TV antenna installers . . . replaced by the
cable guy and satellite dish installers.
 Eight-track tapes . . . replaced by cassettes.
 Cassettes . . . replaced by CDs.
 CDs . . . replaced by digital recordings and
players.
Don’t get added to the list. By riding the waves
of change, you don’t have to face extinction. In
fact, you can evolve to usher in the era of a new
species of salespeople.

When you’re looking for ways to freshen up your marketing program, make
one change at a time and keep score as much as possible to see what works
and what doesn’t. If you run a television commercial, check to see how much
new business it generated. Was it worth the cost? If you try a direct mailing
campaign, compare your sales figures before running the campaign against
sales figures from the month you ran the campaign and the month following
the campaign. Make sure you’re getting your money’s worth, and if you’re
not, then try something else. 
Don’t completely dismiss a new idea just because it didn’t work the first time.
A television commercial may fail for any number of reasons. Perhaps it wasn’t
aired at the right time or it was a lousy commercial. Gather some feedback
and criticism, try to figure out why it didn’t work, and then make some
adjustments to improve it. If it still doesn’t work after you’ve made the neces-
sary changes, then consider dropping it. 
Finding the “Why” behind
Your Customer’s “No” 
Customers usually have a pretty good reason for walking away without pur-
chasing a product, and you need to know what that reason is, particularly if
the reason is due to something you said or did or didn’t say or do. If a sale
falls through and you don’t understand why, start asking questions and doing
a little soul searching: 
 Consider asking the customer directly, “So I can do a better job in the
future, may I ask why you chose someone else?” or “What could I have
done differently to have earned your business?”
 Ask yourself whether you did something to scare off the customer. I have
learned that some people are turned away by my energy level. I have had
to ratchet it down a notch by mirroring my customers. For more about
the mirroring technique, check out Chapter 6.
 Ask yourself whether your pace was too fast or too slow. I tend to go too
fast, making it impossible for some customers to keep up with me.
Don’t always assume that the customer’s decision to buy from someone else
is your fault. In my business, many times another agent would build up the
seller’s expectations and end up winning the client. This is called “buying the
listing.” I tell prospective clients that I would rather let them down today and
sell their house tomorrow than dazzle them today and disappoint them the
next by not being able to sell their home.
127
Chapter 8: Embracing Change as a Growth Strategy

Personalities don’t always mesh. I’m an aggressive salesperson, which some
sellers don’t like. They prefer someone who’s a little calmer. I’ve had sellers
back away from working with me and then call me back when the agent they
chose wasn’t aggressive enough. Don’t beat yourself up just because a few
customers don’t appreciate your style . . . they may come back to you, and if
they don’t, you have another group of buyers who are probably going to love
your style. 
Leaving a proven product alone 
If you’re selling products that require constant updating, such as computers,
software, or video games, your company has no choice but to constantly
seek to improve those products. In some cases, however, the product is per-
fectly fine. If it has a proven track record, leave the product alone and try
changing everything else. Frequently, a subtle adjustment in packaging, mar-
keting, or even your sales presentation can transform a mediocre-selling
product into a smash hit. 
In 1957 Tang was first introduced in the USA and received a lukewarm
welcome. Sales didn’t really take off until 1972, when Apollo flights were
associated with the product. The manufacturer changed the packaging
by including a map of the moon on the label and ramped up its marketing.
The product became a huge seller without a single change to the product
itself.
Sometimes you have to be brutally honest when analyzing what works and
what doesn’t. Now is the time to call up the harshest critics and creative
thinkers. Toss everything that doesn’t work and replace it with something
that holds more promise. 
Capitalizing on Changes in the Industry 
Nowadays, an entire industry can undergo a transformation that seems to
happen overnight. Remember the video arcades of the early 1980s? As
soon as game systems became readily available for homes, video arcades
disappeared from the landscape. Satellite radio has made the task of sell-
ing radio advertising that much more difficult. Rising oil prices influence 
car-buying decisions. Rising or falling interest rates affect the housing
market. 
128
Part II: Pumping Up Your Sales Muscle 

Although you’re often powerless to stem the tide of changes in the industry,
you need to remain well-informed and sensitive to changes that may affect
what you sell and the way you sell it. Keep your finger on the pulse of the
industry and any factors outside the industry that may trigger changes: 
 Read widely. Changes in politics, the economy, or related businesses
can affect your industry. In addition, reading widely can often open your
mind to new ideas that can boost sales. 
 Read industry publications. Subscribe to at least one trade publication,
and then read it. All too often, I see people subscribe to journals or mag-
azines and then just stack them in the waiting room. 
129
Chapter 8: Embracing Change as a Growth Strategy
Sales visionaries
Industry leaders are often visionaries who
demonstrate how to capitalize on changes in
the industry. Here some stories of some of the
visionaries I find most inspiring: 
 Dave Liniger, founder of ReMax, envisioned a
national brand for real estate agents. He
began a program for training agents and was
the first to create real estate conventions. His
first convention attracted only 16 participants.
Now, the conventions draw over 10,000.
 Walt Disney saw that the car would become
more affordable to more families and the
day would come when families would want
to drive to a single vacation spot that would
offer something for kids of all ages.
 Guthy-Renker envisioned a multimedia mar-
ketplace in which a coordinated marketing
through TV, radio, the Internet, and direct
marketing could transform individuals into
brands that could drive sales of various
products. Guthy-Renker also applied its mul-
timedia marketplace idea to the real estate
industry through Guthy-Renker Home, using
a community building concept to generate
target leads for real estate agents.
 Ralph J. Roberts, Comcast founder (no rela-
tion to Ralph R. Roberts), popularized cable
television. In 1963, Roberts purchased a
1,200-subscriber cable television system in
Tupelo, Mississippi, that he eventually grew
into the largest cable television company in
the country, Comcast Corporation, employ-
ing 87,000 people and serving 24 million
customers.
Consider adding your own name to this list of
visionaries. You may think you’re just in sales
and that you’re not a corporate mogul like these
folks, but when you think about it, these people
were selling, just like you. As they were selling
and trying to make a living, they just happened
to notice an opportunity. Instead of simply day-
dreaming about it, they seized the opportunity
and made it happen. You can, too.

 Attend conferences. When you want to hear the buzz, attend confer-
ences and network with your peers. You can often spot upcoming trends
long before they appear in the trade publications. 
 Research on the Internet. Visit the Web sites of the industry leaders
and look for clues as to what’s coming around the bend. If they have a
newsletter, subscribe to it. 
 Stay connected. Talk with others inside and outside of the industry. In
addition to gathering valuable information, you often find that chatting it
up with other professionals sparks creativity and innovation.

Chapter 9
Branding Yourself through
Shameless Self-Promotion 
In This Chapter
 Discovering your marketable assets
 Proving you’re special . . . on paper
 Giving your marketing materials a uniform look
 Making a name on the Internet
 Grooming yourself to become a recognized expert
T
ypical sales people target markets, customers, and clients. Top-producing
salespeople become the target — they market themselves. They build a
strong brand presence, so that prospective customers and clients seek them
out whenever they become aware that they need the product or service the
salesperson represents. 
Whenever I speak to salespeople, I like to ask, “Can you close your eyes and
visualize the president of the United States?” Of course, everyone can do
that. I then ask, “What does your spouse look like? What do your parents look
like? What does your dog or cat look like? What does your car look like?”
Everyone can visualize these persons, animals, or things, because they know
them intimately and see them on a regular basis. The images are tattooed on
their brain cells. That’s what you’re shooting for when you market yourself.
You want everyone in your area to know who you are and what you do, so
when they think of a product or service you sell, your face pops up first in
their minds.
By investing some time, talent, and energy into building a brand presence or
persona, you become a much more efficient and effective salesperson.
Prospective customers and clients call you. Cold calls become warm calls.
And because you’ve already established trust, you no longer need to con-
vince prospective customers and clients that you’re trustworthy. 

In this chapter, I lead you through the process of finding something unique
about you that you can market, and show you how to log all of your assets on
paper to simplify the process of marketing those assets. I then reveal several
different ways you can market yourself to build a brand identity that your
customers, past, present, and future, won’t be able to forget.
Don’t read this chapter unless your ready, willing, and able to handle hun-
dreds of phone calls and e-mail messages every week. If you’re not geared up
to handle the workload, hire an assistant, as explained in Chapter 13, to take
on some or all of the burden. Be prepared for some added perks, as well.
Shameless self-promotion often results in getting you the best table and serv-
ice at local restaurants, complimentary products and services, and even
opportunities for intriguing projects that may or may not be related to what
you’re currently doing. Prepare to be pleasantly surprised.
Discovering the You in Unique
What is it about you that people will remember? What would you like them
to remember about you? Whatever that something is, that’s what you want to
promote.
A real estate colleague of mine in Montgomery, Alabama, Sandra Nickel, is
known far and wide as “The Hat Lady.” She wears a distinctive hat wherever
she goes. Her hat logo appears on her business card, all of her correspon-
dence, and even on her Web site Invest in Montgomery, Alabama
(www.investinmontgomeryalabama.com). Sandra has a solid team of real
estate professionals who handle the daily business. She functions as the rain-
maker, ensuring that the phones keep ringing and the Internet remains abuzz
with the voices of interested buyers and sellers. She tells the story of
Midtown and volunteers tirelessly to improve the community. In the process,
the Hat Lady attracts a lot of attention . . . and a lot of business.
Whatever you choose to be known for, make sure it’s something you can be
comfortable with for your entire career. As long as Sandra wants to remain
the Hat Lady, she has to wear a hat. 
Another of my colleagues Michael Scott Karpovich, who’s a member of the
NSA (National Speaker’s Association, Michigan Chapter), wears two different
colored tennis shoes. At every meeting, I find myself checking to see whether
he has them on, and sure enough, he always does. When people point it out
to him, he says, “Yeah, that’s funny, I have another pair just like them at
home.”
132
Part II: Pumping Up Your Sales Muscle 

I’ve tried several different slogans and other attention-grabbers to set myself
apart:
“You win with Ralph Roberts!”
“It’s a wonderful day in the neighborhood.” (Mr. Rodgers inspired.)
“Call Ralphie.” My dads’ name was Ralph, so when I was growing up,
everyone called me Ralphie, and sometimes people still call me that.
“Big Sh’t.” My Aunt Louise used to call me and my 50 cousins “little sh’ts.”
I returned the favor by calling her “Big Sh’t.” When I bought my first boat,
I christened it “Little Sh’t.” When people ask me what it means, I say
“Little Shot,” but when Aunt Louise came to our lake house for the first
time and saw the boat, she knew exactly what it really meant, and I could
see the alligator tears welling up in her eyes.
Some of what I do may appear more than a little kooky to people who are more
reserved, and I’m certainly not recommending that you do exactly what I do.
Find a way to promote yourself that fits with your personality. If, however,
you’re extremely shy, that’s something you’re going to have to overcome.
In real estate, agents love to add their pictures to everything. Some even go
so far as including their wives, children, and dogs in their marketing mug
shots. I’ve never been particularly fond of using family portraits for promo-
tion. I avoid using family for several reasons, one of which is that I can’t stand
sharing the stage with them when my marketing campaign is supposed to be
all about me. The other, more important reason is safety. I suggest keeping
your spouse and children out of your marketing efforts.
Even my closest advisor, Lois Maljak has jumped on the branding bandwagon.
When she steps in front of an audience, she introduces herself as Lois . . .
“ . . . most people spell it L-o-u-i-s, which is pronounced Lew-iss, but my
name is spelled L-o-i-s. To help you remember my name, there are two
famous Lois’s: One is the Lois in the Bible, Timothy’s grandmother who
led Timothy to faith. The other famous Lois is . . .”
And the audience replies in unison, “Lois Lane!”
Lois replies, “Exactly! Lois Lane is right. And who does Lois Lane hang
out with? 
The audience yells, “Superman!”
And Lois says “Exactly! I would like to introduce you to Ralph Roberts!”
When Lois is finished, nobody in the audience could possibly forget her
name. She’s drilled it into their heads, complete with the proper spelling.
133
Chapter 9: Branding Yourself through Shameless Self-Promotion

Pick something you want to be known for. This could be a hat, tie, fancy
shoes, the car you drive, a childhood nickname, a physical trait, or anything
else on which you can focus your personal marketing campaign on promot-
ing. For me, it’s the Big Nail, as explained in the following sidebar.
Shameless self-promotion stresses “self.” Sure, you may put your company
logo and name on your business card and correspondence, but You, Inc. is
ultimately the company you’re promoting. You, Inc. is the central focus of
your marketing campaign.

Discovering my uniqueness in a really big nail 
In 2003, I discovered my uniqueness on eBay, in
the form of an 11-foot high, 500-pound nail. But
this was no ordinary nail. This was the Big Nail,
part of a very recognizable roadside attraction
for anyone living in the Detroit metropolitan
area, where I did business.
For nearly a half century, visitors and locals driv-
ing into Detroit, Michigan, from the Metro Airport
have been welcomed by one of Motor City’s most
recognized symbols: the 80-foot-tall Uniroyal tire.
First created as a Ferris wheel attraction for the
1964/1965 New York’s World’s Fair, the landmark’s
appearance had evolved to reflect over 40 years
worth of changes in tire technology and style and
stood as an important symbol of Uniroyal’s long
heritage in the metro-Detroit area 
The Giant Tire has towered alongside Interstate
94 since 1965. In 1998, to demonstrate how their
NailGard self-sealing passenger tire worked,
Uniroyal placed an 11-foot high, 500-pound nail
into the tread of the Giant Tire. 
In the fall of 2003, as part of a $1,000,000 reno-
vation to the 80-foot tire, Michelin, Uniroyal’s
parent company, removed the Big Nail from the
tire and donated it to the city of Allen Park,
Michigan. The City of Allen Park put the Big Nail
up for auction on eBay, and a short time later, I
placed the winning bid, and purchased the Big
Nail for $3,000. The proceeds from the sale
helped fund the Allen Park Historical Society’s
programs and facilities. 
I bought the Big Nail simply because I wanted
it, but it has turned out to be the perfect brand-
ing tool for me and my business. After all, 
nails build houses. My father was a builder. In
the Oxford dictionary, “nail” means “to join
together.” I love joining together with my cus-
tomers to join them with their dream homes. I
love joining together with my community and
with worthy charities to improve the world.
The Big Nail appears on my business card, let-
terhead, and Web site, and on the side of my
Hummer, which is affectionately known as the
Nail Mobile or “The Hammer.” The Big Nail has
taken on a life of its own as a retired cultural
icon, making guest appearances at charity
fundraisers, community parades, and other
events, and has become so popular that she has
her own assistant just to keep up with bookings
and appearance coordination.
One of the Big Nail’s most memorable retire-
ment appearances was in a parade celebrating
the Detroit Pistons’ winning the 2004 NBA
championship. Thomas “Hit Man” Hearns,
another Detroit icon, rode with the Big Nail
alongside of “the Nail Man” . . . that’s me.
More serious salespeople may have scoffed at
the idea of building a brand around something
as silly as an oversized nail, but the Big Nail
worked and continues to work for me (see my
examples in the figure). Find your uniqueness,
your Big Nail, and start marketing it.

Changing Your Name?
Unique is good, but if your name is so unique that people can’t pronounce it
or so common that you sound just like any other Tom, Dick, or Harry, then
you may want to consider changing it. To attain celebrity status in any field,
you often have to think and act like a celebrity, and celebrities often change
their names to make themselves more memorable. Here are some of the more
famous people have opted for simpler, snappier names:
Donald James Yamcy became Don Adams
Tim Allen Dick changed his name to Tim Allen
Marion Michael Morrison chose to be known as John Wayne
Madonna Louise Veronica Ciccone shortened her name to Madonna
Donald Trump often goes by simply The Donald
You certainly don’t have to change your name to make your name into a
brand, but some names are certainly easier than others. If your birth name
poses too great of a challenge, you may want to consider using something
that others are going to have an easier time remembering.
Crafting a Unique Selling
Proposition (USP)
Why should your customers do business with you instead of one of your
competitors? That’s the question that your Unique Selling Proposition or
Unique Selling Point (USP) needs to answer. Think of a USP as a sort of
resume or curriculum vitae that’s focused less on your knowledge, experi-
ence, and accomplishments and more on how your customers can benefit
from your knowledge, experience, and accomplishments.
You may or may not decide to share your USP with prospective customers,
but having a USP, in writing, serves three important purposes:
 Enables you to spot weak areas where you can improve
 Reminds you of the value you deliver to customers, so you can remind
them of it
 Provides you with written content that you can use in other marketing
materials you develop
136
Part II: Pumping Up Your Sales Muscle 

In the following sections, I show you how to get started on your USP, flesh it
out with additional details, and then use it effectively in your marketing and
sales campaigns.
Check out my USP at www.AboutRalph.com. It may be a little on the long
side, but it demonstrates how to structure and word a USP in a way that
focuses more on benefits and solutions and less on features.
Moving from features to 
benefits to solutions
Your USP is not about you, it’s about what you can do for your customers
that your competitors cannot or will not do. In your USP, you’re selling your-
self, but keep in mind that when you’re selling anything, you’re always selling
to a customer. You need to prove to your customer that nobody can serve
their needs better than you.
To focus your USP on addressing your customers’ needs and providing solu-
tions, begin connecting what you have to offer (features) to your customers’
needs to develop a list of benefit statements, and then apply those benefit
statements to the solutions that you offer. The following steps show you how:
1. Divide a sheet of paper into two columns — what you have to offer on
the left, and your customers’ needs on the right.
2. In the left column, list your education, experience, skills, and any-
thing else you have to offer.
3. In the column on the right, list your customers’ needs.

U-S- . . . what?
Shortly after Flipping Houses For Dummies hit
the shelves, someone at Guthy-Renker called to
ask if I would be willing to develop some real
estate content for a new Internet-based
resource for real estate agents. Early in our dis-
cussions, my contact at Guthy-Renker Home
said he could help get connected with some
industry leaders, and he suggested that I put
together a USP. 
Prior to meeting with the people at Guthy-
Renker Home, I had never even heard of a USP,
but after my contact had mentioned it, “Create
a USP” jumped to the top of my to-do list, and
that was the first project I launched after return-
ing home. As soon as I had my USP in hand, I
quickly realized what a valuable marketing tool
it really was. It has opened all sorts of doors for
me since.

4. Draw lines to connect each customer need with what you offer that
best serves that need. 
5. Write at least one benefit statement for each skill-need combination that
expresses how you are uniquely qualified to serve the customer’s need.
If, for example, you’re a certified computer technician, you’re selling com-
puter equipment, and your customers often need technical support, one
of your benefit statements may be, “Specialized training in computer serv-
ice and repair make me uniquely qualified to answer any questions you
may have regarding the setup and upgrading of your computer.”
6. Group related benefit statements into logical categories. These cate-
gories should represent solutions to common problems that you solve
for your customers.
After completing this exercise, you should have the content you need to actu-
ally put together your USP, as explained in the following section.
Crafting your personal-professional USP
Your USP is essentially Your Name For Dummies. Consider it a brochure that
lays out exactly why your customer would want to buy from you rather than
from any other salesperson on the planet. Your USP should include the fol-
lowing elements:
 Your name: You’re marketing yourself, so your name is the title of
your USP.
 Your photo: Obtain a professional photograph that has you looking pro-
fessional. This is the image that you want to tattoo on your customers’
brain cells.
 A one-line summary of your USP: This is a single phrase or sentence
that describes your unique selling point.
 Section headings: Use plenty of headings to break down the material
into easily digestible chunks.
 Detailed information: Go easy on the paragraphs, opting for lists, wher-
ever possible, but provide plenty of detail under each heading, so you’re
reader is fully informed.
Include testimonials from other customers or clients, if you have testimoni-
als. Including positive statements from other customers is a big plus, just be
sure to obtain written permissions from your clients before quoting them.
138
Part II: Pumping Up Your Sales Muscle 

Implementing your USP 
in marketing and sales
I created my USP when Guthy-Renker requested it. I sent the entire 22-page
document in its full glory. I rarely use the whole USP in my marketing materi-
als, but I constantly find myself copying and pasting paragraphs and lists
when I’m creating proposals and presentations. I take the most pertinent
information, paste it where needed, and then make a few modifications, if
necessary, to blend it in with the other material.
You can also use your USP to remind yourself before sales calls and presenta-
tions exactly what you offer your customers that nobody else in your area
can or will offer. Never forget your USP, and never let your customers forget
it, either. That’s why they buy from you.
Designing a Consistent Look and Feel
Some of the most creative salespeople I’ve met have the toughest time creat-
ing a brand presence. They get bored with having everything look the same.
Their instinct tells them to use a completely different design for their busi-
ness card, stationery, Web site, brochures, and so on. When creating a brand
presence, however, consistency is exactly what you want. (For more about
creating a brand presence, check out Branding For Dummies by Bill
Chiaravalle and Barbara Findlay Schenck.)
Giving all of your marketing materials a unique look would be like dressing up
in a different disguise every day of your life — your customers wouldn’t be
able to recognize you. To create a strong brand presence, use the same basic
design, colors, fonts, and logo on all of your marketing materials, including
the following:
 Business card
 Stationery
 Brochures
 Pamphlets
 Newsletters
 Press releases
 Websites
 Blogs
139
Chapter 9: Branding Yourself through Shameless Self-Promotion

Unless you’re a talented designer, don’t trust your instincts. Hire a profes-
sional. Find some marketing materials you like and contact the company that
sent them out to find out who did the design. Or, head down to your local full-
service print shop and ask whether they know of any designers. After you
settle on a design, color scheme, font, and logo, get some feedback from your
better, honest customers before forging ahead. Once you pick a design, you
should stick with it, so make sure you’re going to be happy with it three or
four years from now.
You’re not a shameless self-promoter if you don’t have a billboard. If you sell
to the general public, get your photo pasted on a billboard along with a
short, catchy slogan and your phone number, email address, and Web site
address. Whenever I mention billboards, at least a few salespeople object on
the grounds that they “don’t want to scare customers away.” Those who
object usually have a low self-esteem. My response is this: “What do you
want to do, scare them when they meet you for the first time? I believe you
should give them fair warning.” Thousands of people are likely to drive past
the billboard daily, and most of them are likely to take notice. If you’re in cor-
porate sales, the billboard idea may not be right for you, but you should still
be looking for other opportunities to get your face in front of prospective
clients — perhaps by taking out an ad in an industry publication.
Establishing Brand Presence
on the Internet
Your marketing materials may work great to establish a brand presence in the
real world, but you also need to consider that other-world — the Internet.
With more and more people shopping on the Web or at least seeking out
140
Part II: Pumping Up Your Sales Muscle 
Tossing my business cards
A lot of salespeople I know treat their business
cards like hundred dollar bills. They stick them in
their wallets or purses and hand them out only to
the people they regard as top candidates.
I treat my business cards more like rice at a
wedding. I’ll go to a sporting event, and when
the crowd goes wild, I lean over the railing and
toss a handful of business cards up in the air.
Some people actually pick them up, stick them
in their purses or wallets, and then call me
when they’re ready to buy or sell a house. I love
when I ask someone, “So, how did you hear
about me?” and they reply, “I caught your card
flying through the air at the Pistons game.”
Carry a stack of business cards with you wher-
ever you go. Leave them on the counter at the
local diner. Tack them up on the message board
at your local grocery store. Hand them out to
everyone you meet.

additional product information on the Web, establishing a brand presence on
the Internet is essential.
Establishing a presence on the Internet isn’t quite as effective in building cus-
tomer trust as having a brick-and-mortar business with a phone number and
mailing address. The stronger your presence on the Internet, however, the
more likely your customers are going to feel as though they’re dealing with a
legitimate business.
In Chapter 16, I show you how to take advantage of the multimedia market-
place and provide additional details on how to create a your own website and
blog. Here’s a checklist of what’s required to build a brand presence on the
Internet:
 Register your own domain name. (A domain name is a text-based
address of a computer on the Internet. In www.dummies.com, dummies.
com is the domain name. The domain name is also the part of an email
address that comes after the @ sign.) The reason you want your own
identifiable domain name is the same reason you want your own tele-
phone number and address — it tells your customers exactly where to
find you. If you start selling for another company, having a unique
domain name enables your customers to follow.
 Build your own Web site. Well, you don’t actually have to build it your-
self. You can hire someone to do it, but you really should have your own
website with a design that’s consistent with the look and feel of your
other marketing materials.
 Build and maintain your own blog. Whether or not you have a Web
site, a blog enables you to join the blogging community. Establishing
relationships in a community (online or off) is key to long-term sales
success. If you’re not blogging, start now. For more about blogging to
sell, see Chapter 17. For a lot more about blogging in general, check 
out Blogging For Dummies by Brad Hill and Buzz Marketing with Blogs 
For Dummies by Susannah Gardner .
When posting material on you blog or on other online gathering places,
such as MySpace and Active Rain, remain professional. I see young
people posting material that they think is cool at the time, and they fail
to realize that what they say is going to follow them for the rest of their
lives. The same is true for adults, especially people who are in business.
Before posting a message on your site, think about how that message
reflects on you as a person and how it may affect the perception that
future customers may have of you.
 Contribute to other online communities. Even if you have your own blog,
you should establish a presence in other online communities, including
MySpace. Contribute to other peoples’ blogs and answer questions
posted in message boards. Where appropriate, you can mention your own
Web site and blog to drive traffic from these other communities to your
landing pads on the Web.
141
Chapter 9: Branding Yourself through Shameless Self-Promotion

 Publish an eNewsletter. An eNewsletter, which you can distribute via
email or by posting it on your Web site, enables you to contact your cus-
tomers regularly with valuable information and promotions without
seeming to be just another pushy salesperson.
 Add a signature to your e-mail messages. Every e-mail program has an
option to add a signature to all outgoing messages. Include in your signa-
ture your name, contact information, and a list of your accreditations,
titles, and Web sites. Here’s the signature I use:

Establishing a presence on the Internet is not a one-time deal. Don’t simply
set up a Web site and then leave it to stagnate. Unless you keep fresh content
coming, people are going to stop visiting. If necessary, draw up a schedule to
freshen the content regularly, at least once a week.
Boosting Your Street Cred
When you find someone who knows what she’s talking about, your natural
inclination is to seek out that person whenever you need assistance with
something in her area of expertise. If you find an excellent restaurant server
142
Part II: Pumping Up Your Sales Muscle 

who knows everything on the menu and how it’s prepared and is attentive to
your needs, you want to sit at that server’s table every time you eat at that
restaurant. If a certain financial advisor is known as the most successful and
trustworthy in your area, that’s the person you want handling your money. 
In real estate, I specialize in several areas, including foreclosures and real
estate fraud. When people have questions or concerns related to either of
these topics, they often seek me out. They know that I’m a recognized expert.
Maybe they read a quote from me in a news article, heard me on the radio,
saw me on the news, or heard me speak to a local group. Whatever the case,
they know my face, they’re aware that I know what I’m talking about, and
they trust me long before they meet me in person for the first time.
Become an expert in your industry. You don’t have to be an expert on every-
thing, but be an expert on something. Then, get out there and prove to the
world that you’re the expert you say you are. In the following sections, I show
you where to go to start establishing yourself as the resident expert.
When you’re first getting started, you may have to actively seek out speaking
gigs and other opportunities to prove yourself the expert. Once you get the ball
rolling, however, you can pretty much stop looking, because people are going
to seek you out. All you have to do at this point is make yourself available.
Speaking to local groups
Local groups, including church groups; philanthropic organizations, such as
Kiwanis, Rotary, and the Lions club; the chamber of commerce; and schools
are always on the lookout for speakers with expertise on a wide variety of
topics. 
Many of these groups begin their regular meetings with a 15- to 20-minute
speech, and the meetings are often packed with community and business
leaders. This gives you the opportunity to get your face and message in front
of many of the decision makers without having to make a heavy-handed sales
pitch. If you do meet with these people later in a sales situation, they already
feel as though they know you, making your job that much easier.
In the following sections, I provide some tips on how to get your start as a
local public speaker.
You don’t have to speak on a business-related topic. You can talk about what-
ever interests you — a hobby, marriage, the challenges of raising teenagers.
As long as you’re engaging, entertaining, and have something to say, your
speech is likely to be memorable.
143
Chapter 9: Branding Yourself through Shameless Self-Promotion

Honing your public speaking skills
Many salespeople who are comfortable speaking to individuals and small
groups are terrified of delivering a speech to a large group of people. You can
get therapy for that — behavioral therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy
(CBT). This type of therapy is effective in assisting people with overcoming all
sorts of phobias, including the fear of flying and the fear of public speaking.
Another (less expensive) approach is to join Toastmasters, an international
club devoted to assisting its members in developing their public speaking and
leadership skills. Toastmasters groups typically consist of 20 to 30 members
who meet once a week for about an hour to acquire new skills and take turns
practicing those skills and evaluating one another. To find out more about the
organization and locate a group near you, visit www.toastmasters.org.
Work on your elevator speech — a prepared speech that you deliver when-
ever someone asks you what you do. I have several such speeches for differ-
ent situations. If the person asking me “What do you do?” is likely to be
buying or selling a house, I deliver the “I Sell the American Dream” speech. If I
think they may be more interested in topics related to real estate and mort-
gage fraud, I deliver the “I Protect the American Dream” speech. Sometimes
just for fun, I walk into the elevator, face the other passengers, and announce,
“My name is Ralph Roberts, and I just lost my job at the Post Office.” That
usually loosens up the crowd.
Assessing the PR value of local groups
If you sell high-end stereo systems, you don’t want to get stuck talking to the
Women’s Auxiliary. Of course, I don’t know what you sell, so I can’t exactly
tell you which groups you want to speak to. I sell real estate, the books I
write, and my services as a speaker and coach, so I speak to a wide variety of
groups, including real estate investment clubs, homeowners associations,
and neighborhood organizations that are interested in finding out what they
can do to protect themselves against real estate and mortgage fraud.
Brainstorm a list of organizations and local groups in your area, and then prior-
itize the list. Highlight the groups that are most likely to put you in front of the
movers and the shakers — these are the people who can open doors for you. 
Getting your foot in the door
Selling yourself as a speaker is just like selling products, but first, you need a
product to sell. Write a 15- to 20-minute speech, complete with a 1- to 2-page
handout demonstrating that you have something to say. Shop it around to the
leaders of the groups you want to speak to. Better yet, join the group, estab-
lish relationships with the group’s leaders, and let them know that you’re
interested in addressing the group.
144
Part II: Pumping Up Your Sales Muscle 

Don’t just plan your marking campaign, work it. I recently drove past a busi-
ness that was going out of business. Six people clad in sandwich boards were
walking up and down the street to advertise the “Going Out of Business Sale.”
I thought to myself that if they had invested this much energy in promoting
the business, the probably wouldn’t be going out of business.
Delivering your speech
Whenever I speak to a group, I have three goals — to engage, entertain,
and educate. I try to hook my audience from the very beginning, keep them
laughing or crying, and pass along some valuable information or a bit of
wisdom. When I succeed, everyone in the audience has an unforgettable
experience. Hopefully, they undergo a bit of a transformation. And they
always remember me.
Another way to encourage people to remember you is to offer them a gift — a
handout with speaking points, a copy of an inspirational book, or some other
token that they can look at later. Whatever you choose to give, make sure it
reinforces your brand presence. It should include your name, contact infor-
mation, Web site address, and so on.
After delivering your speech, hang around for the rest of the meeting and
linger for awhile after the meeting. Attendees are most likely to seek you out
following the meeting and introduce themselves. Be ready to hand them your
business card or brochure.
For additional public speaking tips, tricks, and techniques, read Public
Speaking For Dummies, 2nd Edition by Malcolm Kushner.
Volunteering your time and expertise
Branding is about more than giving yourself a high profile on the shelf. It’s
about earning a reputation as someone who is sincerely committed to building
better communities, and that means volunteering your time and expertise. 
As a salesperson, you have a unique gift to offer just about any nonprofit
organization on the planet — your ability to sell and generate revenue. Every
organization needs at least one salesperson to contribute to their fundraising
efforts. If you want to take a break from selling, you can use your communica-
tion and organization skills in any number of ways.
Several sales gurus recommend that you “give to get.” I prefer the “give to
give” approach. Give for the sheer pleasure of giving. If you expect something
in return, you’re setting yourself up for disappointment. You may be so busy
waiting for the expected return on your investment that you completely miss
what you actually receive. In Chapter 14, I reveal the “give to give” lesson I
learned from Art Fettig, something he calls The Platinum Rule.
145
Chapter 9: Branding Yourself through Shameless Self-Promotion

When you’re shopping for a nonprofit organization, try to find one that’s a
right fit for you and your business. I volunteer my time and expertise to
Habitat for Humanity. I’m passionate about enabling every family around the
world to realize the dream of homeownership, and Habitat for Humanity is
the perfect fit for me. Try to find a way to give back to the community that
supports your business. And don’t just write a check — participate.
Participating enables you to interact with community leaders.
Becoming the resident expert
Back in the days of local merchants, everyone knew who the town experts
were. You could just stroll down Main Street and look for the sign. The same
is true today, although the small town is now a global economy and Main
Street is the Internet. To become the most successful merchant on Main
Street, you need to become the resident expert — the person everyone
thinks of when they think of buying whatever it is you sell.
The first step is often the hardest — actually becoming an expert. Posing as
an expert when you’re not truly an expert is a sure way to lose whatever
credibility you have. Do your homework and become a true expert before
you proclaim yourself one. In other words, don’t say that you invented the
Internet unless you really did.
After overcoming this initial challenge, you’re ready to build credibility by
doing any or (preferably all) of the following:
 Publishing articles magazines and journals.
 Writing a book. (If you can’t find a publisher, self-publish. Books are like
business cards on steroids.)
 Granting interviews to local reporters.
 Being interviewed on radio or hosting your own radio show.
 Appearing on television in both advertisements and news stories.
 Giving speeches to local groups or national organizations.
 Hosting a website or blog where you provide valuable information and
guidance.
See Chapter 16 for additional details on tapping the full power of the multi-
media marketplace and Chapter 14 for more information on the power of
Relationship-Commerce.
146
Part II: Pumping Up Your Sales Muscle 

Nobody likes a know-it-all, but everyone appreciates someone who really
knows her stuff. By establishing yourself as the resident expert in a specific
area, you become much more than a face and a logo — you become the go-to
guy or gal, the person that other people seek out when they have a question
or a problem.
Meeting and greeting the general public
If you sell to the general public, always be on the lookout for opportunities to
connect with the man and woman on the street, particular those in your
market. Everyone in your market should know who you are, what you do, and
what you sell. 
In the following sections, I describe two techniques I use to mix it up with
prospective clients in my market. These techniques may not apply to all
forms of selling, but they can help you stimulate your creativity to develop
your own techniques.
Mastering the 10/10/20 technique
One of the not-so-secret secrets to sales success is to build on past success.
That is what the 10/10/20 technique is all about, and here is how it works
when applied to selling real estate:
When you list or sell a house, knock on the 10 doors to the left and right of
the house you just sold and the 20 doors across the street and distribute
your postcard with a handwritten note letting the neighbors know that you
have listed or sold their neighbor’s home.
That is it. That is all it takes to start generating new clients. It should take you
less than an hour. Most of the neighbors are not going to want to talk with
you at length. In less than an hour you have the potential of reaching 10,000
people.
Whoa! Where did that 10,000 number come from? According to my estimates,
from attending weddings and anniversaries, every person knows at least 250
other people. By contacting 40 people in the area, you indirectly contact
nearly 10,000 more, and everyone in sales, particularly in real estate, know
that selling is all about meeting people and building relationships.
When is the best time to practice shameless self promotion? Right now, say
you just sold a Chrysler 300 to a nice couple. Have another salesperson take
a picture of you and your customers in front of the car and put it on a post-
card. Ask permission to send the postcard out to their neighbors. You should
also give them a stack of postcards, so when they get their new vehicle and
drive it over to Aunt Sally’s house they can give Aunt Sally a postcard.
147
Chapter 9: Branding Yourself through Shameless Self-Promotion

If you’re in corporate sales, tweak the technique. On your client’s birthday,
show up with a cake, introduce yourself around the office, let everyone know
about the birthday, and present the birthday cake to your client. How many
salespeople does your client know who would remember their birthday and
do something to celebrate it? Your client will always remember you, and so
will everyone else in the office. Take a photograph of your client and her
coworkers, upload it to your blog with a brief message, and email your
client sending a link to the page. You don’t even have to wait for your client’s
birthday — simply show up to celebrate a “Just Because” day.
Sponsoring your own Flag Day
Every year in anticipation of the Fourth of July, my brother David, who’s also
a top-producing agent in Florida, and about 15 volunteers, including his own
family members fan out across his farm area, planting 18-inch American flags
on every lawn in the neighborhood — about 800 in all. The team meets at
about 6:30 pm for pizza and soft drinks before setting out on its mission and
wraps up a couple hours later. In the morning, they do one last drive around
to make sure they haven’t missed any homes. David also sends cards to all
the people who receive the flags, saying, “Happy 4th of July, Enjoy your flag!”
The residents of David’s small, tightly knit community love it, and every year,
David receives about 50 handwritten letters from residents thanking him for
their flags. The flags pull the residents of the community together and stand
as a reminder of the fact that this community and the United States overall
are great places to live. It also demonstrates David’s commitment to the
community.
Don’t miss out on an opportunity to demonstrate your patriotism, give back
to your community, and generate goodwill and positive PR. Purchase a few
cases of attractive American flags, round up the troops, and fan out across
your community to plant flags on the lawns and patriotism in the hearts of
the residents of your community. 
If you’re in corporate sales, adjust the strategy to make it work for you.
Perhaps you could put together a Fourth of July snack platter, complete with
tiny American flags, a red-white-and-blue motif, and a stack of your business
cards, and deliver it to your client’s office the business day before the Fourth
of July. Add a few firecrackers and ask the staff who in the office is the real
firecracker. Include a few prizes just for fun. If you sell pharmaceuticals, stuff
empty medicine bottles with small prizes and snacks, put a bowl of them in a
central location where everyone meets to talk and laugh, and the office will
never forget you!

Stepping Out of Your Comfort
Zone: Taking Risks
In This Chapter
 Defining your own comfort zone
 Imagining what life could be like
 Relieving your fear and trepidation
 Discovering opportunities in problems
 Failing toward success
S
uccess isn’t measured solely by achievement. It’s also measured by failure.
If you haven’t failed, you haven’t taken enough risk to test your limits, and
you’re probably not achieving the level of success you’re capable of achieving. 
You’re likely to always feel some fear when facing the prospect of failure, but
keep in mind that those who profit most take the biggest risks. This chapter
shows you how to alleviate the fear of risk taking by carefully assessing the
risks and the potential benefits, setting achievable goals, and preparing well
in advance to minimize your risks.
Two types of failure exist — failure from poor planning and execution and fail-
ure from over-reaching. The type I discuss in this chapter is in the failure-
from-over-reaching category, but in either case, as long as you learn from
your mistakes and do your best not to repeat them, you’re making progress.
Marking the Boundaries
of Your Comfort Zone
Every time you say “I can’t,” you plot a point on the perimeter of your
comfort zone. You define your limitations. And I stress the “You” for good
reason — you have a choice to choose comfort and complacency over the
potential uneasiness of stepping into the unknown. You have the choice of
whether to gun for gold or settle for silver or bronze.

Recognizing the boundaries of your comfort zone, however, often signals the
start of something better. Every time you find yourself saying “I can’t” or “I
won’t,” write down exactly what you can’t or won’t do. Then, try to identify
the reason why. If you’re having trouble getting started on this exercise, here
are some common reasons why people claim they can’t do something:
 Insufficient funds: You simply cannot afford to do what you really want
to do.
 Insufficient time: 24 hours a day, 7 days a week just isn’t sufficient.
 Family limitations: Your partner wouldn’t go along with it or you have
kids to support and simply can’t afford to chase your dreams.
 Lack of knowledge or skills: You just don’t know enough about it to
actually do it or do it well enough to satisfy yourself.
 Can’t get a break: A tight group has control over who’s in and who’s
out, and you are definitely outside the circle.
 Fear of failure: You simply can’t stomach the thought of what could
happen if your best efforts fell short.
 Fear of success: This can be just as much of a hindrance as a fear of fail-
ure. Many people dread the thought of how their lives could change if
they achieved their dreams. Would it be bring more work and responsi-
bility than you could handle?

Taking calculated risks
I’ve risked and lost millions of dollars on various
investments and business ventures, but I have
also earned millions more by taking well-calcu-
lated risks and preparing a solid foundation first.
I encourage you and others to try something dif-
ferent, but to do so in a way that minimizes your
exposure to risk. Have a plan, human resources,
financing, and your ability to sell in place, and
you have a much better chance of turning risk
into dollars.
Whenever I consult a company or coach sales
agents, I test their temperament first to deter-
mine how much risk they’re really willing and
able to take on. My goal isn’t to have them take
on less risk but to take it on in such a way that
limits their chance of failing.
Recently, a business owner retained me as his
consultant during a period when he was plan-
ning to expand his business to an additional
location. Everything looked great, but I advised
him to pass on the expansion at this point and
focus more on establishing the business. I
wanted to see them become more of what they
were, build their brand, strengthen their staff,
and broaden their client base, before launching
a new office. My reasoning was that I knew
other opportunities would come but the
stronger the foundation of the business, the
more prepared they would be to take full advan-
tage of the opportunities.
Take risk, but prepare well in advance to mini-
mize the downside and maximize the upside.

I could go on and on. It’s okay to admit these limitations. In fact, I want you to
get them all down on paper or a white board or a chalkboard or wherever
else you list things. Put all of your excuses . . . er . . . limitations out there, so
you can see them, feel them, and get to know them. 
After you have a complete and comprehensive list, go back over it and see
how many of those limitations are really self-imposed. I would challenge you
to find one limitation on your list that you couldn’t overcome:
 Insufficient funds: You can always find someone to loan you the money
if you have a great plan in place and the determination and resources to
implement it. Head down to your local bank and start talking to people.
 Insufficient time: In Chapter 11, I show you how to make more time. In
Chapter 5, I reveal the secret to expanding time by using technology and
human resources to increase the amount you can accomplish in a set
period of time.
 Family limitations: Healthy families support one another in their goals
to achieve self-fulfillment. If your partner or other family members are
not supporting one another, you may need some outside assistance. 
You should all be pursuing your dreams. That’s what life is all about.
Otherwise, you’re simply taking up space and wasting resources.
If family members are not supporting you, consider the asking-for-
forgiveness-instead-of-permission approach. Pursue your dreams,
regardless of what they think. If they get upset and reprimand you for
not consulting them, apologize. I know that the daytime talk-show hosts
are going to criticize me for recommending this — you should always
consult your partner. But I’ve been doing this for years, and sometimes
it’s the only way to get anything done.
 Lack of knowledge or skills: You can overcome this common limitation
in one of three ways — learn it, hire it, or partner with it. I don’t know
one tenth of what I would need to know if I had to do everything by
myself, but I know people who with the skills and knowledge I need. See
Chapter 13 for additional details.
 Can’t get a break: Make your own breaks.
 Fear of failure: Think of the worst thing that could happen. Is it really
that bad? 
 Fear of success: Think of the best thing that can happen. In most cases,
the best that can happen is that you become incredibly busy. The addi-
tional business means more profit. More profit means you can hire more
people to do the work for you. You now have more choices — work
more or work less, focus on your business or focus on other, more grati-
fying pursuits.
151
Chapter 10: Stepping Out of Your Comfort Zone: Taking Risks

Successful people view obstacles simply as speed bumps, not as impenetra-
ble blockades. With a little ingenuity, you can overcome anything that initially
appears to be a limitation. 
Envisioning Life Outside
of Your Comfort Zone
Dwight D. Eisenhower once said, “If you want total security, go to prison. There
you’re fed, clothed, given medical care and so on. The only thing lacking . . . is
freedom.” 
Until you wander outside of your comfort zone, you really have no idea what
it feels like there. It’s sort of like deciding to live with your parents for the
rest of your life or never leave the town you grew up in or refuse to leave
your state or your country. By staying put, you never even have a taste of
what’s out there, good or bad. It’s called being provincial — a fancy word for
narrow-minded.
Some people are naturally compelled to set out on adventures. They’re
explorers who couldn’t possibly sit in one place for any length of time.
Others almost have to force themselves out of the comfort of their recliners.
If you’re one of these more sedentary folks, I offer a few words of advice, pre-
sented in the following sections, in the hope that they quell your concerns
and kick you in your keister.
What’s the worst that can happen?
I’m somewhat of a specialist in the foreclosure arena. My capable assistant,
Lois Maljak may even be more accomplished in this field, especially when it
comes to dealing with distressed homeowners who haven’t quite lost their
homes yet. In any event, I’m accustomed to working with people in the midst of
what they consider to be the absolute worst thing that can happen to them —
losing their home.
One of my main challenges in these cases is convincing the homeowners that
they only stand to lose this home. They and their family are going to live
somewhere. They are going to have another place to call home, another place
to build memories. Losing this home is not going to destroy their family or
their future . . . unless they let it.
I can’t tell you the worst thing that can happen to you. I have experienced what
I believe is the worst thing that could ever happen to me when my daughter
Kolleen died at the age of 18, on Memorial Day 2006. Death is irreversible. Some
152
Part II: Pumping Up Your Sales Muscle 

illnesses are incurable. I suppose those are things that I would consider the
worst things that can happen. Anything related to money is not something
that is irreversible or incurable. I’m not saying that money is unimportant,
but if going bankrupt is the worst thing that ever happens to you, you’re
pretty fortunate.
Think of worst things that you can imagine ever happening to you. If taking a
risk in business exposes you to the chance that the worst things you can imag-
ine really will happen to you, then you may want to step back. Otherwise, what
do you really have to lose? My assistant’s (Lois’s) father would tell her that the
definition of a problem is one that money can’t solve. Everything else is just a
nuisance.
What’s the best that can happen?
You have this idea in your head of how you can be hugely successful. What if
it really happened? Play it out in your mind. If you put your plan into place,
and it worked to perfection, how would you feel? How would all the people
around you feel? How much better would the world be? How would your
family fare? 
I spend a lot of time assisting salespeople with building a sales team, which is
a huge risk. You reach a point in your career when you feel as though you’ve
hit a plateau, and you can’t sell more without a team of talented individuals
supporting you. To take your sales career to the next level, you have to build
a team, but that means leaving your comfort zone; giving up control; relying
on others to do what you feel nobody can do better than you; training, moti-
vating, and paying others; generating enough business to keep everyone busy
and paid; and so on.
The risk discourages many salespeople from building teams, but that’s
mostly because they fail to see the upside — being able to focus on what they
do best, outsourcing all of the tasks they find least rewarding, spending more
quality time with family members; sharing their accomplishments with team
members; learning new tips, tricks, and techniques from team members;
boosting sales and revenue; and so on. Don’t let the downside of risk cloud
your vision to the point at which you are blind to the upside.
What if you don’t even try?
What if you waited to do anything until you knew beyond the shadow of a
doubt how it would turn out? You would never even be able to get out of bed.
I would never have met my wife Kathleen. I wouldn’t have had kids. And I cer-
tainly wouldn’t have written this book. I would still be waiting until I knew
what was going to happen. Where’s the fun in that?

Insights from my trials and errors
When people meet me or anyone else who is
currently successful, they tend to assume that
the person could do no wrong — that every plan
worked, every business was a phenomenal suc-
cess, and money was never an object. This is
rarely the case, and it certainly wasn’t the case
with me. I’ve seen more victory than defeat, but
I’ve had my share of disappointments.
Here are some of my most memorable suc-
cessful ventures:
 Grass cutting: My first business venture car-
ried no overhead. I used my Dad’s lawn
mower, gas, oil, and repair services. This was
one of the few totally risk-free businesses
I’ve ever had. I cut it in high gear, mowing the
neighborhood once, perhaps twice, a week.
I made so much money that by the age of 16,
I could afford to pass my lawn-mowing busi-
ness to my younger brother Dave and try my
hand at ice cream (see the section on fail-
ures) and then T-shirts.
 T-shirts: As a senior in high school, I took a
silk screening class and learned how to
make posters, T-shirts, and a host of other
cool products. For most of my classmates,
silk screening became a part-time hobby.
For me, it became a business. I would pur-
chase a gross of plain T-shirts, the class
helped me make them, and then I would sell
them. My top-selling shirt was “Steve Tyler,
Aerosmith – Lord of the thighs.” The busi-
ness eventually folded. Upon graduation, I
lost my market . . . and my free employees.
 Real estate investment: I was invited to
speak to a group of investors about the
foreclosure process in my area and actually
became more involved in the investment
group than I had anticipated. The organizer,
Dick Mazur, had a unique way of pumping
up the investors. He would canvass the
room asking each person what he or she
was willing to invest. When he arrived at
the gentleman next to me, Dr. Lee, he said,
“Dr. Lee, I have you down for a million dol-
lars.” Dr. Lee hesitated and said, “I
promised my wife I would consult her
before going forward with any new deals.”
I understood the potential in the deal, so I
raised my hand, and Mazur called on me. I
said, “I don’t have to ask my wife. I would
like to take the million dollar slot.” Mazur
said I was IN! I left the table, went to the
restroom, called my wife, and begged her to
let me do the deal. We spent $5 million and
then we spent $30 million. Rip Hamilton of
Detroit Pistons fame was the first purchaser
in the subdivision that we developed on the
property. It was a huge success.
Of course, I’ve had a good number of disap-
pointments, which tend to be more entertaining
for some reason. Here are a few of my all-too
memorable failures:
 Custom mirror installations: In the late ’70s I
built a custom rack to put on my pickup truck.
I didn’t pound the spikes far enough into the
steel body for them to hold, and they came
loose and damaged the mirrors. I got pretty
good at fixing the mirrors, so I decided to
start my own business. After doing dozens of
jobs and making a pretty good profit, cus-
tomers started complaining. Apparently, the
adhesive I used was eating the silver off the
back of the mirrors. All my profits disap-
peared as I honored the warranties.
 US Rental homes: Along with a few friends
who wanted to invest in real estate, I
started a company called US Rental Homes.
I saw a big demand for good, affordable

If you don’t travel to France, you have no idea what it’s like there. If I haven’t
spent time with you, I really don’t know who you are. If I haven’t even tried to
achieve my lifelong dream, I can’t possibly achieve it. I would have as much
chance at attaining my dream as I would have getting from Detroit to Los
Angeles by sitting in my office and MapQuesting it.
Life is to be lived. The more fully you live it, the more of it you have. If you
choose not to live life fully, you end up squandering opportunities and regret-
ting it later. Attempting a great feat and failing at it is more noble than never
making an effort.
Estimating your ROR (Return on Risk)
Businesspeople always talk about ROI (return on investment). I like to talk
about ROR (return on risk). You approach ROR the same way you approach
ROI — measure the potential upside against the potential risk to determine if
attempting the venture would be “worth it.” Following are some tips on how
to approach ROR:
 Don’t be concerned about what others think. It’s your idea, your pas-
sion, and your life.
 Don’t risk everything — separate your personal and professional risks
When I first started, my wife was in on every deal. As my business grew,
her name was off of every deal. If I lose everything, we can still live on
what my family owns and vice versa.
155
Chapter 10: Stepping Out of Your Comfort Zone: Taking Risks
rental properties. Our company published a
daily listing of rental properties that people
could subscribe to for $69. The trouble was
that we had far more tenants than houses,
so we had to refund everyone’s money. 
 Ice cream: Perhaps my most disappointing
failure was my attempt to sell ice cream. At
the age of 16, I purchased two ice cream
trucks, figuring that I could drive one and
hire someone to drive the other one. Only
later did I discover that at the age of 16 I
was not legally permitted to drive the truck.
I ended up having to hire college students. I
hadn’t counted on this expense or the cost
of repairs or the loss of products when the
generator broke down and all the ice cream
melted. After a few years of frustration, I
cut one truck from my fleet and sold the
“business.”
Throughout this book, I drive home the point that
as a salesperson, you’re an entrepreneur, and
the more you think like one, the better you are
going to perform. You have to try something
new, take risks, and stick out your neck to
achieve anything. You are likely to fail, but if you
don’t try, you’ve already failed.

 Ask for more then you want, to get what you need. Shoot for stars and
land on the moon.
 Research carefully to take calculated risks, but don’t use the need for
more research as an excuse to avoid getting started.
 Develop a backup plan. If your plan doesn’t quite work out or takes
longer, what are you going to do?
 Start immediately, if not sooner.
Following are some signs that the risk may not be worth it:
 You could loose everything.
 The upside is negligible or non-existent.
 You haven’t done any research.
 You have no backup plan.
Reducing the Fear Factor
Fear of failure is probably the second biggest cause of failure. The first is
fear of the unknown — just watch any horror movie. The easiest way to over-
come these fears is to take action. Don’t succumb to the common affliction of
paralysis by analysis. Simply forge ahead with your plans.
156
Part II: Pumping Up Your Sales Muscle 
Making tactical use of your fears
I’m not sure I agree with Franklin Delano
Roosevelt’s quote that “We have nothing to fear
but fear itself,” at least in the context of sales.
As I see it, my biggest fear has been my biggest
asset. 
Many people have a fear of flying, fear of public
speaking, fear of death, and so on. The biggest
fear I have is of being alone. I don’t even have a
key to my office building or my homes. I go
places only when other people are there. When
I first was married and had our daughter, Kolleen,
I would pay someone to babysit while I was
home, so that I would have someone to talk to.
Or I would order a pizza and pay the delivery boy,
Willie, to stay with me and keep me company. 
When I described my fear to the people in my
office, they didn’t believe me. “How can you ride
in the car alone?” they asked. I said, “I’m not
really alone . . . I’m on the phone the entire time.”
I think that if I weren’t as afraid as I am of being
alone, I would never have been as successful. I
always was and always will be on the lookout
for someone to do business with, whether it’s a
customer, a partner, an agent I’m training, or
someone else. And as long as I’m looking for
people, I am going to find them, connect with
them, and produce something with them.
Identify your fears and try to transform them
from liabilities into assets.

If you don’t like that approach, I have some other suggestions. In the follow-
ing sections, I reveal several techniques you can use to reduce and perhaps
even eliminate the fear that’s weighing you down.
Fear isn’t necessarily bad. It can motivate you to achieve even higher levels
of success, if you handle it properly. Let fear motivate you, not defeat you.
Researching the viability
of an idea or opportunity
You may be able to ease into a risky venture through research and planning. I
often encourage real estate agents to diversify by creating several depart-
ments in their real estate businesses — one for sellers, one for buyers,
another for cash buys (investing in real estate), probate properties, public
relations, foreclosures, and so on. In the foreclosure arena, I show them how
to properly research foreclosure properties and have them sit in on three or
more auctions before placing their first bid. After weeks of preparation, they
feel much more confident and comfortable placing their first bid.
If you’re afraid of implementing a new plan because of the risks you think are
involved or the amount of time, effort, and money it may require, start
researching. Read a book, search the Internet, and gather some facts. The
mere act of taking the initiative to do some research can give you the momen-
tum you need to actually launch your new idea. 
To have any chance as a big game hunter, you eventually have to pull the trig-
ger. I’m often accused of following the “ready . . . fire . . . aim” approach to
business and sales. I don’t always hit the mark, but at least I take plenty of
shots. Don’t get in the rut of thinking that research is an end in itself. You
eventually have to make a decision and then take action. You won’t hit any-
thing if you don’t pull the trigger.
Following the trailblazers
Chances are pretty good that someone has already attempted and perhaps
even implemented, to some degree, whatever idea you have to boost sales or
increase business. You just have to find out who.
Success leaves huge footprints that are pretty tough to miss. As you perform
your initial research, keep an eye peeled for footprints and discuss your
ideas with trustworthy colleagues and friends. Many times, simply talking
about an idea generates enough buzz to drive the people you really need to
talk to directly to your door.
157
Chapter 10: Stepping Out of Your Comfort Zone: Taking Risks

After you have identified one or more individuals who’ve blazed the trails,
contact them to discuss your ideas. The most highly successful people are
usually the most generous with their time and expertise. After all, that’s prob-
ably how they became highly successful. They may even be able to refer you
to other specialists who can assist you in actually implementing you plan.
Assembling your own advisory board
Big companies and organizations often have advisory boards that guide the
development of new ideas and departments. Consider taking the same
approach as an individual. 
I’ve leaned on dozens of experts in a wide variety of fields to guide me over
the years, including Tom Hopkins, Zig Ziglar, Dennis Waitley, Mark Victor
Hansen, Art Fettig, Howard Brinton, David Knox, Dave Beson, Stanley Mills,
Steve Westmark, David W. Roberts, Cathy Russell, Danielle Kennedy, Floyd
Wickman, Darlene Lyons, Karen Dice, Chip Neumann, Chip Cummings, Steve
Stewart, Robert Kiyosaki, Norman Schwarzkopf, Ed Primeau, Terry Brock,
Terry Wisner, Pete Thomas, Michael Soon Lee, Marge Fraser, Eric Pruitt,
Richard Nacht, Stefan Swanepoel, Bob VanGoethem, Joe Sirianni, Tony Ferris,
Jerry Toler, Dave Ebner, Steve Tarzy, Dan Brophy, Rachel Dollar, and Kathy
Bott, to name a few of the thousands of those who have offered guidance,
advice, time, and resources.
Jot down a list of the people you admire — successful people with the exper-
tise to assist you. Pick the top 10 or 20 and place them on your personal advi-
sory board. Enlist their insights and advice on your current projects and look
to them in the future. In addition to providing you with guidance, these
people will passively, and perhaps actively, hold you accountable for doing
your best and achieving the goals you share with them.
Setting achievable milestones
Fear often takes hold when a project seems overwhelming. My plan to
“change the world one million people at a time,” sounds overwhelming at
first, but I’ve managed to break it down — to divide and conquer. Using vari-
ous technologies and media channels, I can actually communicate with audi-
ences that are literally in the millions:
 Blogging: Blogging’s online, all-the-time, on-demand venue enables me
to post an article on the Web and make it available to billions of people
around the world.
 Books: The numerous books I’ve written have sold hundreds of thou-
sands of copies and provide me with the raw material I need to develop
other products, articles, and commentaries.
158
Part II: Pumping Up Your Sales Muscle 

 Magazines and journals: Magazines and journals, online and off, provide
me with the opportunity to publish my ideas and even generate more
traffic to my websites and blogs.
 Press releases: With a one-page press release, I can instantly connect
with hundreds of thousands of people online and off to let them know
what I’m up to.
 Radio broadcasts: Radio stations frequently call me for interviews and
opportunities to present real estate investment seminars and talk on
other topics.
 Online podcasts and video: These new media give me the power to
broadcast audio and video recordings over the Internet to people across
the nation and around the world.
 E-mail: Through e-mail blasts and drip campaigns, I connect with a million
people each and every week. Every week, I have a unique and valuable
message to offer my contacts, and e-mail gives me the means to distribute
it quickly and economically.
To see just how my e-mail campaign works, send me an e-mail message at
ralphroberts@ralphroberts.com, requesting to be added to my list or
request my signature (the name I sign to my email messages), which I have
been told gets passed around quite a bit. I often send out flash movies, inspi-
rational poems, and other items that recipients highly value. In addition to
receiving these free gifts, you get a glimpse of my marketing campaign in
action.
Although I decided early on that I wanted to change the world one million
people at a time, I didn’t try to do everything at once. I started blogging at
FlippingFrenzy.com. Reporters noticed my blog and contacted me for inter-
views. Online publications contacted me to write articles and commentaries.
Book publishers contacted me to write books. All of a sudden, I had a great deal
to say and hundreds of people providing me with the means of broadcasting my
message to the audience of millions I had only been able to dream about.
When you have a vision that seems overwhelming and perhaps grandiose in
the eyes of some, start breaking it down into more manageable units. Then,
identify one task and get started. Getting started is often the hardest part.
More likely than not, your momentum is going to carry you somewhere
you’ve never imagined, so just get started and find out the rest later.
Focusing on the present
I’m not one of these people who preaches that you should throw caution to
the wind, live for today, and let tomorrow take care of itself. I encourage
people to plan well, save for the future, and remain fairly conservative with
their family nest eggs.
159
Chapter 10: Stepping Out of Your Comfort Zone: Taking Risks

When it comes to implementing a new strategy or technology that can boost
business, however, don’t let concerns about the future or about costs para-
lyze you. Jot down a list of tasks you must accomplish to achieve your goal,
and then run through the list, tackling one task after another. Eventually, you
discover that you’ve run out of tasks and have achieved your goal.
Looking for Trouble . . . and
Finding Opportunity
Sales success often hinges on your ability not only to overcome adversity but
to capitalize on it. Almost every invention came about as the result of some-
one recognizing a problem and coming up with a solution. 
160
Part II: Pumping Up Your Sales Muscle 
Expanding business with a systems approach
I’ve achieved a great deal of success through
what I like to refer to as a systems approach. I
identify a business opportunity that’s related to
some business I’m already running. Then, I
create a separate division or department for it,
hire someone to run it, and add it to my collec-
tion of “small businesses.” I created the follow-
ing departments under the umbrella of Ralph R.
Roberts Realty:
 Buyer Department services people who are
buying a home. This enables me to service
half of the real estate market. At the same
time, buyers often generate more listings
when they need to sell.
 Listing Department services people who
are selling a home. Sellers are the corner-
stone of any real estate business.
 Closing Department handles all of the
paperwork, so my agents can focus more
energy on the dollar-productive activities of
buying and selling homes.
 Cash Buy Department enables me to move
quickly on great investment properties. I fig-
ured that my agents and I are constantly
researching properties and talking with
homeowners, so we may as well purchase
some of the best buys.
 Property Management prepares the prop-
erties we purchase for sale or rent and
manages the rental units. It also manages
properties for other investors in the area
who own rental units.
 Foreclosure Department is dedicated to
assisting homeowners who are facing fore-
closure. This department also purchases
foreclosure properties at auction.
 Public Relations & Marketing ensures that
me and my business are properly marketed
to drive more business and opportunities
our way.
This systems approach has diversified my busi-
ness and enabled me and my employees to
quickly adapt to changing market conditions.
When the housing market is slow, we can cap-
italize on opportunities in the cash buy and fore-
closure departments. When the housing market
picks up, we can shift our energies to serving
buyers and sellers. 

Now, you may wonder why I’m talking about inventors and inventions in a
book about advanced selling, but as a salesperson, you have to be an innova-
tor to be a top producer. Your job essentially consists of recognizing a cus-
tomer’s problem and then presenting an attractive, viable solution.
As an entrepreneurial salesperson, you can play an even greater role as inno-
vator by recognizing problems that you or your customers face and turning
them into revenue-generating opportunities. You may even be able to set up
an entirely new division in your company to sell a related product or service
or spin off a separate company.
Regaining Your Footing
When You Stumble
When you’re taking substantial risks, you’re likely to lose your footing every so
often and perhaps even fall flat on your face. I have suffered some hardships in
161
Chapter 10: Stepping Out of Your Comfort Zone: Taking Risks
Spotting opportunities in foreclosures
Early in my career as a real estate investor, I
made a mistake and lost one of my properties in
foreclosure. It made me sensitive to the plight of
homeowners who had experienced financial set-
backs and were facing the loss of their home. 
When I started my real estate business, I
noticed that few real estate professionals
devoted any time to or resources to assisting
this segment of the market. Most of the
investors working in the foreclosure arena were
more interested in making a buck than in actu-
ally assisting the homeowners. Many of them
added to the burden of the homeowners by pre-
senting misleading or false information.
I saw an opening for investors who acted with
integrity. I educated these distressed home-
owners, let them know their options, and
assisted them in selecting the most attractive
option for their situation. As a real estate
investor and agent, I could offer one option that
most investors couldn’t offer — to place the
house on the market and sell it before the home-
owner lost the home and all the equity they had
in it. Sometimes homeowners would sell the
house to me when they needed to make a quick
decision, and other times, I would sell it for them
so they could hold on to more of the equity.
I didn’t always get the home or the listing, but
I usually managed to benefit in some way.
Over time, I established a reputation for acting
with integrity. Many of the people I assisted
became customers for life. Some referred to
their friends and family to me when they were
facing similar situations. Of course, a few
people saw me as merely another opportunistic
foreclosure investor, but you can’t please every-
one all the time.
The point of this story is that you can often turn
problems, your own or someone else’s, into a
revenue-generating sales opportunity.

my life, but with the help of family and friends and my policy of sticktoitism,
I’ve managed to recover. You find out who your true friends and family mem-
bers are during your darkest hours.
Remember that most often people fail their way to success. Success isn’t for
the faint of heart. Most people quit before they succeed. They just give up.
The steps to recovery function follow pretty much the same path, regardless
of the cause of the failure:
1. Cut your losses.
2. Identify what went wrong.
3. Fix the problems.
4. Regroup.
5. Try the same thing again with the required changes or try something
else. 
One step I omitted because you already should have taken it is this — clean
house. Purge your area of negative people, don’t share your goals with people
who are not goal-oriented, and surround yourself with positive goal-setters.
Michael Eisner, Chairman of the Board of the Walt Disney Company, once
said, “Recovering from failure is often easier than building from success.”
Even when you succeed, you may feel as though the road ahead leads uphill.
Continue to adjust your plan, gather resources, and recruit talented individu-
als to take full advantage of the success ahead.
And what happens if you go all in, risk everything, and lose? Then you have
to start all over. That means evaluating what you do, how you do it, what
you’re selling, and your approach and trying something completely different.
Starting from scratch is tough, but it can be done, and it always beats the
alternative — giving up.

Selling Tools and
Resources

In this part . . .
You may not have realized this, but you’re not just a
salesperson, you’re a business — You, Inc. To flour-
ish as a business, you have to invest in it. You have to be
ready to spend some money, and in this part, I help you
spend it . . . wisely, of course.
Here you discover what to spend your money on to get
the biggest bang for your buck, how to better budget your
time, and how to expand time while boosting revenue by
equipping your business with the right technologies and
hiring key personnel.

Chapter 11
Investing and Re-Investing
in Your Success 
In This Chapter
 Making productivity your priority
 Jotting down a list of must-haves
 Finding the cash to finance your success
 Finding and making more time
T
he top 20 percent of professionals in any field invest 80 percent more time,
money, and other resources on being the best. That’s how they achieved
their success, and that’s how they continue to build on it. These top-20 per-
centers are constantly in the process of improving themselves, their cus-
tomers, and everyone around them. They don’t seek out ways to pass the
time. They don’t piddle away their resources on unproductive pursuits. And
they certainly don’t waste time and energy griping about how bad they have
it. Instead, they seek knowledge and wisdom, more efficient systems, better
technology, and solutions to problems. They invest in their own success. 
This chapter shows you how to invest wisely in your own success. Here, I
show you why investing in productivity almost always outweighs the cost of
the initial investment. I then show you how to prioritize your investment
needs, finance your investments, and make the best use of time.
By the end of this chapter, you should have a fairly good idea of where you
need to begin your self-improvement program and how you’re going to find
the time and money to implement it.
Invest in your own welfare — physical, emotional, spiritual, personal, and
professional. As a healthy, happy, well-balanced individual, you are capable
of accomplishing much more than if you focus on only one aspect of your
well being.

Focusing on Productivity Instead of Cost
The old cliché “You have to spend money to make money” doesn’t apply
only to business owners or investors. It applies to salespeople, too. You can’t
compete in this world if you don’t have a nice wardrobe; an attractive, com-
fortable car to drive clients around in when needed; a reliable computer; a
cellphone; high-speed Internet; a Web site or blog; marketing materials; one
or more assistants; and lifelong education and training. All of this stuff costs
money.
You can’t wait until you can afford it to lay out the cash for everything you
need. As a real estate agent, you couldn’t possibly get started in the business
if you had to drive your clients around looking at houses in an old jalopy with
no air conditioning or a broken heater. You couldn’t compete without a com-
puter and e-mail access or a cellphone number that your clients could call to
get in touch with you immediately.
The cost of not having what you need to do your job better than any of your
competitors is an expense you cannot afford. You may need to borrow from
friends or family members, take out a loan at the bank, hit your boss up for
an advance on your salary, barter, or figure out some other way to pay for it,
but these tools and resources are necessities, not luxuries. See “Financing
Your Investments,” later in this chapter for details on how to make these
necessities more affordable.
166
Part III: Equipping Yourself with Advanced Selling Tools and Resources 
Don’t quit your day job
If you’re just getting started in sales, don’t quit
your day job until you have all the tools and
resources required to make a smooth transition.
When I started selling real estate, I was working
as a carpenter for my father’s business. I
worked from six in the morning until three
o’clock in the afternoon as a carpenter and then
sold real estate in the late afternoon and
evenings, after most people returned from work.
I sold my first house to myself. I was going to
use it as an investment property, so I stayed
living with my parents. A few months later, my
mother kicked me out of the family home. She
said that if I was going to be a homeowner, I
would have to live in the home.
I kept working with my father until I had all the
tools I needed to become a full-time real estate
agent, and then I made the leap. I’ve never gone
back. Perhaps if I had tried to leap too soon, I
would still have been a carpenter. 
Keep your day job until you have what you need
along with a little cash in your savings account
to make it through any rough periods.

Prioritizing Your Investment Needs
As I repeat throughout this book, you are a business unto yourself, You, Inc.
Every business starts with a solid business plan, which contains a complete
list of all of the equipment and other resources required to get up and run-
ning. When you’re drawing up your business plan for You, Inc., take this same
approach. Create a list of everything you need, and then rearrange the items
on the list to give the most critical items top priority.
In the following sections, I reveal the resources that most salespeople need
to acquire. You may already have some of these resources in place, and your
priorities are likely to differ depending on what you sell and the way you do
business. If, for example, you interact with customers exclusively over the
Internet, having an impeccable wardrobe and dressing for success may not
be as important as having a top-of-the-line computer with reliable broadband
Internet access.
Dressing for success
Dressing for success seems so cliché, so basic. So why am including it in a
book on advanced selling? Because I regularly bump into very good salespeo-
ple who refuse to accept the fact that they may have to trade in their comfy
pair of jeans for a suit or a pair of khakis and a polo shirt. Some are even
trying to prove a point — that appearance shouldn’t matter. While that may
be a noble notion, the fact is that appearance does matter. Customers and
clients, often unknowingly, judge your competence based on how you look.
For someone just starting out, dressing for success is key. If you’re well estab-
lished, your attire is less important. I have framed photographs and news-
paper articles adorning the walls of my office of myself dressed in different
ways. The most important thing when it comes to attire and fashion is that
you dress for the occasion — for the customer or event. If you’ve never met
the customer, play it safe and dress up rather than down.
If you need a few “better” reasons why dressing for success is important,
here are a few:
 Fosters a sense of commonality
 Eliminates office distractions 
 Creates a more favorable impression
167
Chapter 11: Investing and Re-Investing in Your Success

In the late 1970s, John Malloy wrote a book called Dress for Success that pre-
scribed a uniform of sorts for success in corporate America. In today’s more
casual corporate climate, you may be tempted to think that the days of dress-
ing for success are over, but what has actually happened is that the wardrobe
has simply changed clothes. Blue suits and red ties have been replaced with
khakis and button-down shirts . . . with or without the ties. 
Nowadays, dress for success means that you take your appearance out of the
equation. You demonstrate that you’re aware of your appearance, and you
dress and groom yourself appropriately. 
Consistency is key. If you wear a suit one day, jeans the next, and then a
jacket and slacks, you’re diluting your image . . . your brand presence.
Consistency in grooming and attire triggers a very subtle, long-term shift in
how others perceive you and perhaps even how you perceive yourself.
Consistently present yourself as a professional. Make sure the image you pro-
ject matches the person you want others to perceive that you are. Your image
can make you the go-to guy or gal.
If you can’t dress consistently, at least pack a change of clothes. I often dress
in jeans to show investment properties, but any time during the day, a
reporter may call to do a quick interview. When a reporter calls, I head back
to the office and change into my more “professional” outfit to do the inter-
view. Whenever I represent my company and employees, I want to project an
appearance of professionalism.
168
Part III: Equipping Yourself with Advanced Selling Tools and Resources 
Dress for the position you want
In Chapter 2, I encourage you to envision what
success would look like to you and then start
acting as though you’re already the successful
person you envision yourself to be. This includes
dressing the part.
A hospital security guard I know had an effective
way to create the perception of being qualified
for the job he wanted. Each day, he came to work
in a shirt, tie, and sport coat and would go to the
employee locker room to change into his guard
uniform. Before he left work each day, he
changed back into his sports coat, shirt, and tie. 
The other security guards and company person-
nel teased him a little at first, but management
took notice, he was quickly promoted to the posi-
tion he wanted, and the teasing soon ceased.
If you want to be successful, you have to look
the part. Acting the part may not be enough. 

Pursuing education and training
Early in my career, I scoffed at the need for education. I was young, hungry, and
willing to work as hard as necessary to become the successful salesperson I
wanted to be. And, boy, did I work hard. All of those people I made fun of —
the people who were taking classes at night, learning new technologies, taking
seminars and workshops, reading books, and attending conferences — they
worked hard too, and they made a little less money than I did . . . at first. But
then I discovered that they got where they were going a lot faster than I did.
Although on-the-job training is crucial for sales success, off-the-job training
can provide you with shortcuts later in your career. This off-the-job training
is equally valuable. Focus on the following areas in your continuing education
as a salesperson:
 Your sales craft: By reading this book and putting my suggestions into
action, you’re already investing in this area. After mastering everything
in this book, don’t stop seeking even more ways to improve your craft.
 Product research: Be an expert on the products and services you sell. I
know of several companies in which the sales staff is in constant com-
munication with the people in product development, training, and cus-
tomer service, in order to get up to speed on new products and services.
If your company doesn’t foster this kind of inter-department communi-
cation, recommend it to your corporate managers or implement an infor-
mal system on your own. 
 Customer research: As a salesperson, you’re in contact with current and
prospective customers on a daily basis, but how much do you really
know about them? Become more involved with your customers. Some
companies require their salespeople to work in different departments,
such as customer service and training, for a few days a year, so they
have contact with customers in need and can develop a better sense of
what customers are looking for. You may also consider getting more
involved with customers in online discussion forums, blogs, and chat
groups where customers in your industry are likely to hang out and look
for information and guidance.
 Competition research: As an industry leader, don’t fall into the trap of
researching the competition in order to mimic them, but do keep an eye
on what they’re doing. Researching the competition enables you to iden-
tify areas where you need to improve and can often spark your own cre-
ative ideas for what you can do that your competition is not doing. See
Chapter 20 for more suggestions on checking out the competition.
169
Chapter 11: Investing and Re-Investing in Your Success

Education can take many forms from the most formal (taking classes) to the
least formal (searching the Internet for information). I encourage you to seek
out a wide variety of educational opportunities, including workshops, semi-
nars, distance learning, reading books and magazines, hiring a coach, and so
on. No form is better than any other, but you quickly discover that some forms
of education and training open your mind in ways that other forms do not. 
Gearing up with the equipment you need
Whether you work out of your home or are a road warrior, you need equip-
ment to do your job. The not-so-good-old-days of simply showing up in a suit
and delivering your sales pitch are over. The modern salesperson requires a
fully-equipped, Twenty-First Century office, complete with the following:
 Computer
 All-in-one printer, fax machine, copier, scanner
 Broadband Internet access
 Cellphone
 Blackberry device
Technology is great when it works, but don’t use it to impress customers. It
could make them uncomfortable. Never raise the conversation to a level
above what your customers have comfortably mastered.

Harnessing the power of my ADHD
I have officially been diagnosed as having
ADHD. Some would say that I’m suffering from
ADHD, but I don’t see it that way. To me, it’s a
blessing. It drives me to constantly seek out
stimulating learning activities and even optimize
learning opportunities.
In addition to reading, I often listen to CDs, MP3s,
and Podcasts to explore a wide variety of topics.
Recently, I discovered that if I accelerate the
playback speed to twice the speed at which the
narrator presents the material, I can pay better
attention and retain more of the information. 
I shared this observation with my doctor, who told
me that I may have stumbled onto something. He
suggested that he could possibly use this same
approach to help his other patients with ADHD.
My assistant has also speeded up her reading to
me as I work on another computer, place phone
calls, and read e-mails on my Blackberry.
If you have a “disability,” look for ways to trans-
form your liability into an asset. You never know
what untapped energies you can harness with a
little creative thinking.

Fortunately, the equipment you need to become a highly successful salesper-
son has come down in price. In fact, you probably already own many of these
items for your own personal use. See Chapter 12 for more information about
investing in sales-generating and productivity-boosting technologies.
You may also need some low-tech equipment, such as a car, desk, filing cabi-
nets, bookshelves, and perhaps even a nice office where you can meet clients
in person. Although you certainly have to be well aware of the costs, always
ask yourself, “What is the cost of not having this?” If not having what you need
is going to cost you potentially lucrative sales opportunities in the future, are
you really saving money by not buying (or renting) what you need?
Buying the equipment is only the first step. Invest some time and energy find-
ing out how to take full advantage of all the features these devices have to
offer. I know dozens of salespeople who have computers and cannot figure
out how to type a document and send it as an e-mail attachment. They have
fancy all-in-one printers with fax capabilities, and they’re still running down
to the local print shop to fax documents.
Investing in marketing materials
Regardless of how much money your company invests to market its products
and services, you should be spending some company money, or your own
money, if necessary, on marketing yourself. As I discuss in Chapter 9, your
main goal as an entrepreneurial salesperson is to sell yourself. Your sec-
ondary goal is to sell products and services.
At the very least, you should invest in the following marketing materials:
 Business card
 Stationery
 Brochures
 Blog
 Web site
For additional strategies and tips on shameless self-promotion, check out
Chapter 9.
Investing in support personnel
Whether or not you feel that you’re at a point in your career to start hiring
people, you are at that point. If you’re cleaning your own house, doing your
171
Chapter 11: Investing and Re-Investing in Your Success

own laundry, balancing your checkbook, preparing your own taxes, or per-
forming any other number of tasks unrelated to selling for no other reason
than that you “can’t afford to hire someone,” you’re at a point where you
need to hire someone.
To get ahead in sales, realize that first and foremost, you are a salesperson.
Your job is to sell, to make deals happen, to make your customers more suc-
cessful. Don’t waste your time performing tasks that other people can do for
you better and for less money than what your time and expertise are worth.
See Chapter 13 for details about hiring and managing assistants.
Salespeople are often control freaks who have to do everything themselves.
If you’re not comfortable hiring people, start slowly. Hire someone to clean
your house once a week or mow your lawn. If you’re having trouble getting
organized, hire someone to get everything organized for you. Once you start
hiring people and seeing how much more productive it makes you, you soon
find yourself hiring more and more people.
Investing in yourself
Don’t forget to invest in yourself — your own physical, emotional, and spiri-
tual well-being. Exercise, read a good book, take up a new hobby, travel,
spend time with your family, volunteer in the community, have some fun. If
you’re strapped for time, schedule time for yourself.
If you won’t invest in yourself then why would someone want to invest in you
and in your products or services?
Financing Your Investments
Coming up with the funding to fuel your investments in your own success can
be quite a challenge, especially when you’re first starting out. How can you
possibly afford a new wardrobe, a powerful computer, a nice car, marketing
materials, productivity gadgets and software, and an assistant when you can
barely afford yourself?
This question has already been answered by the top salespeople who have
blazed the trail before you. The answer is this: Do whatever it takes... short
of stealing it. Beg, borrow, barter, look for free tools and assistants, share
resources, and think up other clever, creative ways to get what you need. The
following sections explain some of the more common procurement strategies
in greater detail.
172
Part III: Equipping Yourself with Advanced Selling Tools and Resources 

Finding freebies
Acquiring the assets needed for sales success doesn’t necessarily mean you
have to pay for them. You may be able to obtain some of what you need for
free. Here are some ideas to get you started:
 Inquire about internship or coop programs at your local high school or
college. Students often need some work experience and on-the-job train-
ing and are willing to donate their time and effort to achieve those goals.
 Search the Internet for free Web site or blog hosting and tools you need
to create your Web site or blog. WordPress.org is an excellent place to
go to find out more about blogging and obtain the tools and resources
you need.
 Search the Internet for free productivity software. You can significantly
trim your software budget by opting for freeware or shareware (use now,
pay later) versions.
 Contact the SBA (Small Business Administration) for additional equip-
ment, tools, and services you may be able to obtain for free or for
greatly reduced prices. Visit www.sba.gov for details and to find con-
tact information for the SBA office near you.
You can often trim the costs of marketing materials by teaming up with a
company that offers complementary products or services. If you sell cars, for
example, you may be able to convince an insurance agent to cover the print-
ing costs in exchange for including her contact information.
Bartering for what you need
Money is just the most common means of exchanging products and services,
it’s not the only means. You can also barter for what you need. As a salesper-
son, you probably have several valuable assets you can trade in exchange for
products and services you need. I can’t tell you exactly what your assets are,
but here are some ideas for what you may be able to offer:
 Consulting: Ideas for how to increase business. 
 Selling: You may be able to moonlight for someone who has the goods
or services you need.
 Referrals: In exchange for goods and services you need, offer to refer
your clients to this business. I know of one salesperson who dresses
impeccably. She gets all of her outfits at cost because people are con-
stantly asking her, “Where did you get that outfit?” and she tells them.
173
Chapter 11: Investing and Re-Investing in Your Success

 Services: If you have additional services you offer, exchange them for
services or products you need. I sell houses, so I can always offer to
handle a transaction for free in exchange for something I need.
Consult your accountant or tax expert with any questions you have about
how bartering is taxed. Just because money is not changing hands does not
give you the right to avoid paying taxes on it. 
Consider joining a barter exchange. I belong to several. Check out
Tradefirst.com.
Convincing management to invest in you
Although you are ultimately responsible for acquiring everything you need to
achieve sales success, you may be able to convince the company you work
for to foot the bill or at least a portion of it. Draw up a plan that contains the
following details:
 Overview: Describe your plan and what you hope to accomplish.
 Budget: Provide a ballpark estimate of how much money you need to
put your plan into action.
 Equipment: Jot down a list of equipment that you need in order to
implement your plan. Point out equipment that is already available, and
highlight new equipment you need and its cost.
 Human resources: List any additional human resources required. Your
company’s staff may already have personnel in place with the expertise
required, or it may need to hire someone with unique skills.
 Time required: If you had all the resources required, how long would it
take to implement your plan?
 Measurements of success: Always specify exactly how you are going to
quantifiably measure the success of your plan. Is it going to result in
increased sales, increased retention rates of customers, fewer customer
complaints, increased sales revenue? How is your plan going to benefit
the company’s bottom line?
The company you work for is in business to make money. If you can prove that
your plan for success can generate a positive return on the company’s invest-
ment, management is highly likely to buy into your vision. See Chapter 5 for
additional details on how to pitch your plan to your supervisor or to the com-
pany executives.
174
Part III: Equipping Yourself with Advanced Selling Tools and Resources 

Sharing resources
One of the reasons that large companies install computer networks is so
employees can share expensive equipment. The company can buy a powerful
central computer whose power every employee in the building can tap into.
They can also share top-of-the-line printers, high-speed Internet, and backup
facilities.
In the same way, you can network with other people to share resources you
both need. Here are some suggestions:
 Share an office or office building with another businessperson in the
area, preferably someone in the same or a related industry.
 Rent office space and perhaps even office equipment from another busi-
ness in the area. Some businesses have office space that they can’t use
and may offer very affordable rent.
 Purchase and share a separate fax line.
 Pool resources to acquire the marketing materials you need.
 Pitch in with colleagues to hire an assistant to answer phones and shuf-
fle paperwork.
You don’t have to be the sole investor in your success. Share the expenses
with one or more colleagues to make your investments more affordable. 
Securing a small-business loan
When a business needs capital, it either finds investors or it borrows the
money. You may be able to find some venture capitalists or perhaps an afflu-
ent relative to fund your success, but if that’s not an option, consider apply-
ing for a small-business loan.
Sketch out a plan similar to the plan discussed in “Convincing management
to invest in you,” and schedule an appointment with the loan officer at your
local bank. Explain what you’re trying to accomplish, the amount of money
you need, and what you’re going to use that money for. Convince the person
that you are going to be able to pay back the loan, and you’re in.
Don’t get discouraged if your loan request is turned down. Find out why,
remove all the reasons that the person rejected your request, and try again.
You may have to apply for a loan at several banks before you find one that’s
willing to work with you. Stick to it. The word “no” is just a speed bump. Figure
out what put that speed bump in your way and remove it, so you can move for-
ward. “No” may mean “not now” or “I don’t know enough yet to say yes.” 
175
Chapter 11: Investing and Re-Investing in Your Success

Tabulating Your Time Budget
As all sales gurus can tell you, to be truly successful requires succeeding in
all areas of your life — career, finances, relationships, spirituality, recre-
ations, and so on. Occasionally, however, you need to spend more time in one
area than another, and you may begin to feel as though you don’t have
enough time to devote to becoming a highly successful salesperson.
In reality, you probably have more time than you realize. And if you truly
don’t have enough time to accomplish everything you need to accomplish,
you can create more time. 
In the following sections, I lead you through the process of drawing up a time
budget, and then I suggest various ways to buy yourself more time.
Knowing how you spend your time
When you ask anyone in a financial crisis why they’re in a financial crisis,
they almost always say, “We just don’t know where the money’s going.” One
of the first steps they need to take to get their finances on track is to find out
where all that money is going. A good financial advisor would sit the couple
down, have them categorize their income in expenses, and then come up
with totals for each category. Once they know where all the money is coming
from and where it’s going, they can then focus on specific expense categories
where they need to cut back.
When you never seem to have enough time, the first step is to find out where
those 168 hours a week are going. Jot down a list of all activity categories,
which may include the following:
 Working
 Sleeping
 Eating
 Quality family time
 Watching TV
 Internet (productive)
 Internet (unproductive)
176
Part III: Equipping Yourself with Advanced Selling Tools and Resources 

 Reading
 Commuting
 Exercising
 Bathing/getting dressed
 Searching for stuff, such as misplaced files
When you’re jotting down what you do, be brutally honest. If you’re at work
and not actually working, then don’t write down “12 hours working.” Write
down what you were really doing, like “4 hours working, 2 hours poking
around on the Web, 1 hour going through junk e-mail, 45 minutes chatting
with fellow salespeople, an hour and a half for lunch.” Be honest. How much
time are you really working when you’re at work?
Over the course of a typical week, jot down all the hours you spend on each
activity and total the amount of time you spend on each activity. Now you
should know where all that time is going.
Identifying time wasters
After creating your time log, go through and highlight any categories where
you may be able to cut back a little. Perhaps 20 hours a week watching TV
could be cut to 10. Sleeping more than eight hours a day may be a little exces-
sive. Maybe you can cut back a little on unproductive Internet time by
restricting your Internet usage to an hour a day.
Don’t strip all of the time-wasting activities from your life. Everybody needs a
little downtime to recharge their batteries. Some time-wasting activities, how-
ever, are just as draining or even more draining than productive activities.
These time and energy wasters should definitely be removed from your
schedule. Hopefully this won’t keep you from making me your friend on
MySpace! While you’re wasting time online drop in at
myspace.com/ralphroberts.
Finding and making time
Using your time log from the previous week, create a time budget for the fol-
lowing week in which you trim some hours from the time-wasting categories
and allocate them to other categories, such as work, quality family time, or
exercise. 
177
Chapter 11: Investing and Re-Investing in Your Success

Whenever you begin to feel as though you don’t have enough time, look at
your time budget to see where you’re slipping. Falling back into old routines
is all too easy. The time budget can keep you on track.
Although a time budget can assist you in finding more time, you still have
only 24 hours in a day and only seven days in a week, so if you still find that
you don’t have enough time to be a success, the next step is to make time.
Head to Chapter 5 where I show you how to make time by increasing your
productivity through technology and assistants.

Putting the Latest Technologies
to Work for You 
In This Chapter
 Confronting your tech-phobias
 Gathering the tools of the sales trade
 Empowering yourself on the Web
 Harnessing powerful communication technologies
W
ith each passing year, technology changes more and more rapidly. You
may feel as though someone’s cranking up the speed on your tread-
mill when you’re already having a tough time keeping pace. And here I go
telling you that you have to do even more!
Although new technology may seem overwhelming at first, it often opens the
doors to new opportunities and improved efficiency. Resist the latest techno-
logical advances, and you find yourself working harder and harder just to keep
up. Embrace technology, and you soon discover that you’re far ahead of the
pack, and you don’t even have to break a sweat to stay there. 
This chapter shows you how to put the latest technologies to work for you in
generating a host of new clients and ever-expanding opportunities.
Overcoming Resistance
to New Technology
Technology can be pretty scary, especially if you were born prior to
Generation X. Most people can handle a cell phone and even fumble their
way through the process of typing a document or crunching numbers in a

basic spreadsheet. The newer, more challenging technologies, however, can
seem somewhat overwhelming at first. Communication is no longer driven
primarily by telephones and the mail carriers. To remain competitive, sales-
people now have to juggle Blackberries, text messaging, instant messaging,
e-mail, blogs, and other communication tools and technologies.
If you get hot flashes every time you think about having to master some new
technology, the following sections may be able to calm you down.
Assuming a playful attitude
The absolute worst time you can start learning how to use a new gadget or
software package is when you need to use it. You have a presentation to give
tomorrow, and you just installed PowerPoint thinking that this is going to
make your job a whole lot easier. Now you have two problems — figuring out
how to present the material and wrestling with a fairly complicated piece of
software. It’s like trying to read your new car’s owner’s manual while you’re
weaving through city traffic.

Optimizing your technological tools
According to Einstein a genius uses only 10 per-
cent of the brain. I would venture to guess that
most people use about 10 percent of the full
capacity of their technologies, as well.
When you adopt a new technological tool, I
encourage you to get more than 10 percent out
of it. By sticking with the features you need most
and using what you already know, you may be
able to stay on track, but to excel, you have to
reach beyond your grasp. 
I always embraced the latest technologies, but
I’ve never been able to claim ownership of
them. Instead, I purchased the latest gadgets
and software and handed them to my more tech
savvy assistants who were clearly more com-
fortable with the tools. 
On February 28, 2003, all that changed. I called
my IT guy, Pete, and said, “Enough is enough. I
need to get up to speed on this thing called the
computer.” Pete took me shopping. I bought a
laptop for myself, my wife, and each of our kids.
The kids loved it, of course, and as a family, this
became a valuable educational opportunity and
bonding experience. 
My first real experience using a computer was
at the age of 46. I’m 50 now, and I feel very com-
fortable on my collection of computers. I carry
one with me wherever I go.
If you think you’re too old for the new technology,
that’s nonsense. Just start. I suggest you spend
15 minutes to a half hour a day trying something
new. Before you know it, you’ll discover that
you’ve acquired a whole new skill set.

Try to approach new technologies when you don’t need them. Pretend that
you just bought yourself a new toy. When you have some free time, play
around with it. Try it out on something that doesn’t really matter. Show your
friends and family some of its coolest features. The more the technology feels
like a toy, the more your work is going to seem like play.
Carry around the instruction booklet with you so that when you are waiting
in a doctor’s office or for some other appointment, you can glean one new
piece of information to help you with the technology. Whenever my assistant,
Lois and I travel together, she tries to teach me one more feature on my
BlackBerry. Don’t try to swallow the entire manual — consume the informa-
tion slowly, one bite at a time.
Overcoming objections to the cost
As a salesperson, you have to buy stuff as a professional courtesy to all of the
other salespeople out there who are trying to make a living. If that’s not a
good enough reason to shell out some cash for the latest technologies, then
consider some of the potential benefits in terms of sales and productivity:
 Increased sales as the new technologies generate leads
 Enhanced productivity, giving you more time to deal directly with
customers or pursue other interests
 Increased opportunities as you discover innovative uses for new
technologies
 Improved visibility as technologies including Web pages and blogs draw
the attention of customers online
 Increased ability to recommend new technologies to your clients as
another way of giving back to your clients and demonstrating your gen-
uine interest in their success
I’m not sure what the culture is like in your industry, but in real estate, top
selling agents rarely think about how much a product or service costs.
They’re more concerned with how much revenue it is going to generate. Even
if the return on investment is dubious at best, an agent may try something
new and expensive believing it has the potential for a good return.
Consult with someone in your industry who is tech savvy. The last thing you
want to do is arrive at a conference thinking you’ve adopted the latest, great-
est technology only to discover that you should have purchased something
better — you’ve blown all your money on cutting-edge technology and have
nothing left to invest in bleeding-edge technology.

Chapter 12: Putting the Latest Technologies to Work for You

Getting over the feeling that it’s unproven
One school of thought promotes the idea that you should always wait until
a technology has proven it has legs before making it a part of your daily
business. I didn’t graduate from that school. Instead, I analyze the technology
on my own and with the assistance of my more technically gifted colleagues
to determine whether it can do any of the following:
 Save me time or money
 Make me time or money
 Attract positive attention
If a technology can do any one of those three things, preferably all three, then
that’s all the proof I need to become an early adopter.
Pumping Up Your Productivity
with Computers and Software
When I started selling houses back in the mid 1970s, students were still using
slide rules, and all I needed to sell houses was a car, a phone, and a ballpoint
pen. I would never have been able to sell over 300 homes in a single year
were it not for my assistant. I was one of the very first to see the value in an
assistant. Computers and the software deliver similar advantages, enabling
you to accomplish more in less time.
Computer technology has enabled me to push home sales into overdrive and
eventually attain warp speed. I can instantly pull up a list of thousands of
contacts complete with notes about birthdays, anniversaries, and names of
spouses and kids; e-mail thousands of contacts with a single click of a button;
and broadcast articles, audio, and video across the country and around the
world for the cost of a few pennies.
A computer equipped with the right software can significantly increase your
productivity, reduce errors, and boost sales. In the following sections, I
describe the equipment and types of software that no salesperson should
live without.
When you show up with the latest technology in tow and demonstrate that
you can use it, you project an image of competence. Clients want to work
with a salesperson who’s not only old-school personable but also new-school
tech savvy.

Becoming a road warrior 
Salespeople make up a fair percentage of the road warriors in the business
world, and if you’re part of this crowd, you carry your office with you. Make
sure that your traveling office is properly equipped by purchasing and mas-
tering the following essentials:
 Notebook or Tablet PC: A high-quality notebook or Tablet PC is a must for
delivering presentations on the road, carrying your most important digital
documents along with you, and staying connected with the home office
and your other clients. For less than $1,000, you should be able to get a
fairly high-powered notebook PC with 512MB RAM, a 60GB hard drive, a
CD/DVD player, a 15-inch or larger screen, and Wi-Fi capability (so you can
get wireless Internet wherever it’s available). If you’re in a business in
which you or your clients may need to sign documents, I highly recom-
mend a computer that enables you to sign on-screen using a stylus.
 Portable printer: Even if you do everything on the computer and send it
back to the office, I recommend that you pack a portable printer, just in
case one of your clients is more comfortable looking at marketing mate-
rials on paper or requests a paper copy of a contract. 
 Wireless Internet access: Many hotels, coffee shops, and offices have
Wi-Fi (wireless Internet access), and most computers have the capability
to access it when it’s available. But having your own wireless Internet
service is a good idea. Sprint, Verizon, T-Mobile, and other communica-
tions companies offer wireless Internet. Shop carefully to choose a serv-
ice with coverage in the areas where you most commonly travel.
 BlackBerry or Pocket PC: For times when you don’t need to lug around
your full-featured notebook or Tablet PC, a pocket PC enables you to
keep in touch without weighing you down.
 Digital projector: If you deliver presentations to only one or two clients
at a time, you can forego the digital projector. Your clients can easily
watch your presentation on the computer screen. If you need to deliver
presentations to roomfuls of people, then a digital projector is a must.
To choose the right projector, you typically have to make some tradeoffs
in terms of image quality, price, and weight. 
 Ethernet cable: Although most hotels are going wireless, some still
require a cable to connect to the Internet. Toss an Ethernet cable into
your carrying case just in case. Your Ethernet cable can even save you
some money; many business hotels charge to use their wireless service,
but you can get free high-speed cable connections right in your room.
 Power adapter for a car: A power adapter that plugs into your car
enables you to charge your computer’s battery while you travel from
one client to another. Make sure you get the right adapter. Visit your
local electronics store and explain exactly what you’ll be using it for.
183
Chapter 12: Putting the Latest Technologies to Work for You

 Power strip: Carry a power strip. A power strip not only enables you to
plug several devices into a single outlet, but it also functions as an
extension cord, so you can reach an outlet a little easier. I often use my
power strip at the airport and even share it with others who are waiting
for flights — it’s an excellent tool for networking with people in need.
 Digital audio recorder: I use a digital audio recorder to take note of any
ideas that pop into my head and to record my presentations, so I can
review them and improve on them later.
 Digital camera: You never know when you may be presented with a
photo op. Some of these cameras are so tiny now, you can practically
pack them as easily as a credit card. Better yet, get a cellphone that has
a digital camera built right into it; some of these cell phone cameras can
even record short video clips.
 iPod or MP3 player: Don’t waste a moment acquiring knowledge. If
you’re not reading a book, you can be listening to a book on tape . . . or
get pumped up for your next presentation by listening to your favorite
tunes. This is another area where you can lighten your load by buying a
cellphone that has digital recording capabilities.
 Headset: If you have Skype or some other VoIP (Voice over Internet
Protocol) phone service, carry a headset, so you can plug into your
computer to talk on the “phone.” Some of these services can even push
the signal directly to your cell phone, so you don’t have to lug around a
headset.
 Your copy of Advanced Selling For Dummies: Hey, you’re going to need
something to read on the plane and in the hotel room. This book can also
be a great conversation starter that assists you in meeting new prospects.
If you plan on delivering a sales presentation on the road, make sure you
have all the equipment you need and that your equipment is working prop-
erly prior to departure and as soon as possible after you reach your destina-
tion. You don’t want to discover just minutes before giving your presentation
that you forgot the cable that connects your notebook PC to your digital pro-
jector. If your client has promised to provide the equipment you need, call
ahead to remind them and show up early to test everything.
Draw up a checklist of everything you need to pack. I recently went on a trip
and was careful to pack all of my electronic gadgets, but I forget to pack my
driver’s license. That definitely made flying much more difficult. I really had
to rely on my sales skills to get on that plane.
Mastering a contact management program
The single piece of software that no salesperson should ever be without is
a contact management program. I use Microsoft Outlook. Other salespeople
184
Part III: Equipping Yourself with Advanced Selling Tools and Resources 

I know are die-hard ACT users. I’m not about to go on the record saying one is
better than the other, but I do recommend that you use a contact manage-
ment program.
And when I recommend that you use a contact management program, I’m
saying that you should use it to its full potential. You can accomplish this by
reading up on the program you decide to use. Check out ACT! 2007 For
Dummies by Karen S. Fredricks or Outlook 2007 For Dummies by Bill Dyszel.
If all you’re recording are client names and contact information, you’re not
collecting enough information. Gather and record as much personal informa-
tion about your clients as possible, including the following:
 Birthday
 Spouse’s name and birthday
 Wedding anniversary
 Children’s names and birthdays
 Hobbies and favorite pastimes
Whenever you contact a customer, you want to make a good impression and
an emotional connection. Show your client that you care enough about them
personally to remember details about what is most important to them.
Although I encourage you to gather details about your customers, don’t make
your calls sound like interrogations. Gather the information slowly and natu-
rally during the conversation.
Knowing your way around
a presentation program
When you’re delivering a presentation to prospective clients, you want your
presentation to look as professional as possible, and there’s no better way to
do that than to create it and deliver it with a presentation program, such as
PowerPoint.
PowerPoint and other presentation programs almost force you to use your
words sparingly and communicate with clients in a more audio-visual format.
You can even create notes pages to leave with your clients and post your pre-
sentation online, so your more tech-savvy clients have ready access to it.
Perhaps best of all, you can simply adjust a presentation you already created
for a different client instead of starting from scratch. (For instructions, tips,
and tricks for using PowerPoint, check out PowerPoint 2007 For Dummies by
Doug Lowe.)
185
Chapter 12: Putting the Latest Technologies to Work for You

If you’re still putting together your presentations in a word processing pro-
gram or relying on printed marketing materials, one of the first software pro-
grams you should pick up is a presentation program. Clients are often
mesmerized by a presentation on a computer screen that would otherwise
put them to sleep, especially if they get to click through at their own pace.

Making 100 phone calls in your Hour of Power!
Every weekday, I spend one hour making 100
phone calls. I call it my Hour of Power. My goal
is to connect with as many people as possible
who may generate leads for me. The Hour of
Power is about connecting on a personal level
and realizing the rule of 250 — that each person
knows at least 250 other people they can tell
about you. You have to keep in touch with the
people you know in order to meet the people
you don’t know. And having a contact manage-
ment program packed with names and informa-
tion about the people you know is indispensable
in making this work.
I picked up the strategy from Philadelphia’s
“Condo King,” Allan Domb. After hearing that he
was one of the top real estate agents in
America, I shadowed him to witness the secrets
of his success. Domb made the calls with the
help of an assistant, and he used a collection of
sound effects to interrupt calls that started
becoming too involved. One sound effect was of
a telephone ringing. Another was the sound of
someone’s voice calling him over an intercom.
The Hour of Power isn’t a time to get overly
involved with one person. It’s a time to connect
with as many people who may be able to lead
you to future prospects as possible.
Prior to my Hour of Power, I select a group of
people I want to contact. The group may con-
sist of the people I work with on the Macomb
County Voice (a blog we created). It may be the
top selling real estate agents I know through
Star Power. It may be people I sold houses for or
sold houses to. I tell everyone in the office that
my Hour of Power is about to commence, and
they know not to disturb me. Then, I shut myself
in my office and start placing calls.
If someone answers, I deliver my energetic
greeting, ask them how they’re doing, and per-
haps mention one of the details I’ve recorded in
my contact management program — maybe it’s
their anniversary or one of their children’s birth-
days. If nobody answers, I move on to my next
call. If I get the answering machine, I leave a
message. I may even sing “Happy Birthday,”
wish the person a happy St. Patrick’s Day, or say
something goofy right off the top of my head that
I think will make them smile. What you say isn’t
all that important, but it can’t be about selling. 
When you’re doing your Hour of Power, you
cannot be interrupted. Make sure anyone who
may be tempted to interrupt you knows not to. If
you call someone and leave a message and that
person calls back, someone in your office
should answer the call and take a message, not
interrupt you. You can call the person back later,
after the hour is up. Your goal is to make it
through your list of 100 people, and you have
only 60 minutes to do it.
I strongly recommend that you implement the
Hour of Power strategy in your business model.
Keep a log sheet, and strive to achieve the goal
of 100 calls a day. When I coach people, I have
them turn in their call logs to me at the end of
every week. Making the bare minimum of 25
calls a day delivers some benefit, but the truly
successful salespeople are those who do
closer to 100 calls a day. The most important
part is to start doing it.

Always have a backup plan in place. Technology is great when it works, but
sometimes it doesn’t, and when it doesn’t, you still need to be able to func-
tion. I use PowerPoint for my presentations. I back them up on our server
and carry two CDs in different pieces of luggage as well as on a jump drive
when I’m traveling. You can usually find someone you can borrow a computer
from, but you can’t find someone who has your presentation on it. When
giving presentations to clients, a backup plan is even more important. The
show must go on, even if your computer won’t turn on.
Tapping into the Web
The Internet is one of the more powerful and intriguing technologies from
which you can benefit as a salesperson, because it’s an entirely different
world — a digital, virtual, multimedia world where clients and prospective
clients not only passively absorb your message but also interact. 
In some ways, selling on the Internet in the 21st century is more like selling
from a corner store during the 1950s than like selling in the 1990s. The
Internet is turning the entire world into a small town in which customers
base their purchase decisions more on recommendations from peers than on
marketing and advertising. To appeal to these 21st century customers, you
had better have a presence on the Internet, particularly on the Web.
In the following sections, I reveal several ways to leverage the power of the
Web to boost sales.
Researching customers and competitors
One of the main benefits of the migration of sales from the real world to the
virtual world is that you now have easier access to information about your
customers and competitors. Your competitors, at least a few of them, prob-
ably have Web sites or blogs. Customers who use your products and services
may have their own Web sites or blogs and are probably hanging out in com-
munities like MySpace as you’re reading this.
Whenever I speak on the topic of marketing online, I almost always focus on
the need to establish a presence on the Web, but another way to leverage the
power of the Web is to use the information it contains to your advantage, as
discussed in the following sections.
Hanging out with your clientele
Go online and hang out where your customers hang out. Get to know them.
Become part of the community by contributing to their blogs and message
boards. Get involved in their discussions, and offer your expert insights and
187
Chapter 12: Putting the Latest Technologies to Work for You

advice. You don’t have to give your sales pitch; in fact, doing so may harm
your reputation in the community. By contributing something of value to the
discussion, however, you begin to establish a solid reputation online as a
knowledgeable and trusted source.
Contributing to the community means giving something of value. As a real
estate agent, I often contribute by publishing articles offering tips to home-
owners and people looking to buy a home. I also post answers to people’s
questions and publish articles to assist other real estate professionals. If you
sell cars, you may post a newsletter with tips on caring for your car or how to
choose the right car for you. If you sell computer software, you may post arti-
cles or messages on how to use some little known feature of the program or
work around a common problem.
Checking out the competition
When you want to know what your competitors are up to, go online and find
out. You can check out their Web sites, see what they’re promoting and how
they’re promoting it, and gather all sorts of ideas on how to promote your
products, services, and yourself.
You want to lead, not follow, so check out the competition, but avoid the
temptation to mimic others.
Gathering leads
If you’ve already established a strong presence on the Internet, you may not
need to rely on professional lead generation services to steer business your
way, but if you don’t have a strong Web presence or you need additional
leads, check out some of the Internet lead generation services.
In the real estate and mortgage loan industries, lead generation services are a
huge industry in and of themselves. I’m the official spokesperson of one of
the larger real estate lead generation services — Guthy-Renker Home at
HurryHome.com (for consumers) and RealtyTracker.com (for agents). This
service offers home buyers and sellers valuable information about buying,
selling, and owning a home. When a consumer signs up for the free service
and shows interest in speaking with an agent, Guthy-Renker Home gathers
their contact information and passes it along to one or more Guthy-Renker
Home agents in the person’s neighborhood, who can then contact the person.
Assessing the benefits of lead generation services
Lead generation services offer several benefits to you as a salesperson,
including the following:
188
Part III: Equipping Yourself with Advanced Selling Tools and Resources 

 Advertising: Lead generation services often do the marketing and
advertising for you, so you can focus more resources on following up
with motivated customers than trying to find them.
 Screening: The service commonly weeds out any less-promising
prospects, so you deal only with serious candidates who have shown an
interest in your product or service.
 Gathering leads 24/7: While you’re performing other tasks, eating,
sleeping, or even on vacation, a lead generation service continues to
gather leads for you and deliver them on demand.
Before choosing a service, find out how many other salespeople are receiving
the same leads, how old the leads are, and how the leads are screened. Bad
leads are worse than no leads, taking up precious time and resources you
could be spending on more profitable pursuits. 
Making the most of your lead generation service
A lead generation service is only as good as you make it. Many salespeople
claim that services sell the same leads to more than one salesperson, making
it too difficult to actually get that person’s business. While you should cer-
tainly shop for a service that provides higher quality leads and less competi-
tion, you have to do your part as a salesperson to make the most of the leads
you receive. Here are some tips on how to optimize the leads you get:
 Qualify those leads. Your lead generation service may qualify some
leads for you to screen out the worst of them, but you should have your
own system in place for ranking prospects. Spend the most time on the
top prospects.
 Be the first to call and offer the best service. The Internet is like a fast
food restaurant — patrons are looking for instant gratification, immedi-
ate contact. Even slight delays can result in lost opportunities. 
 Follow up with a welcome e-mail message. Have some information
about you and your company and services prepared well in advance, so
you can deliver it without delay.
 Add the customer to a drip e-mail campaign. A drip campaign may
send the prospect a different message once a week or so to remind them
of you. If prospects don’t hear from you, they can find plenty of other
salespeople to deal with.
 Treat your lead like a customer. Too many salespeople expect leads to
be willing buyers. You still have to sell. Treat the prospect well, and you
can turn the prospect into a customer. Continue to follow up, so that the
person becomes a customer for life.
Every system, even lead generation systems, have drawbacks, but if you put
a system in place, make a plan, and then work the plan, you will have more
business than you know what to do with.

Marketing and advertising on the Web
The day I started writing this chapter, Google purchased DoubleClick, an
online advertising firm, for $3.1 billion. That purchase delivers a very unam-
biguous message — online advertising works. To be a top salesperson in your
industry, you had better be advertising and marketing on the Web, no matter
what you sell.
In Chapter 9, I encourage you to set up your own Web site or blog as a form of
soft-sell, self-promotion. You should also be looking into other ways of adver-
tising your products and services and driving traffic to your Web site or blog. 
Most of the major Internet search tools, including Google (Google AdWords)
and Yahoo! offer affordable online advertising in the form of PPC (pay per
click) ads. When someone searches for a word or phrase associated with
your product or service, up pops a link to where you want the person to go.
You pay for the ad only if someone clicks the link. PPC ads aren’t foolproof.
You really need to study up on them before you dive in, but both Google and
Yahoo! have plenty of information to help you get started. (For more about
Google AdWords and other tools for improving sales with Google, check out
Building Your Business with Google For Dummies by Brad Hill.)
In addition to search-engine advertising, identify the sites that people most
often visit to find out more about the products or services you sell and see if
you can advertise on those sites. This may cost more than PPC advertising,
but you have to advertise where your customers hang out.
Networking with colleagues online
With more and more people, especially salespeople, setting up shop on the
Internet, you’re likely to find colleagues from all over the world online. Every
colleague is an opportunity to develop a new relationship, gather strategies
and tips, share information, and open yourself to new sales and business
opportunities.
To get in touch with the top people in your industry, join one or more profes-
sional organizations in your industry and check out what they offer online in
terms of message boards, blogs, and other features where you can meet and
share information with colleagues. Try to obtain phone numbers and e-mail
addresses, and follow up by personally contacting the people you “meet”
online.
Most of the top salespeople in any industry have their own Web site or blog,
complete with their contact information. Visit their site, and if you like what
you see, give them a call or send them an email message introducing yourself.
190

Discovering new sales “secrets”
Although some salespeople are very protective of their “secrets of success,”
top salespeople are so proud of their achievements that they can’t help but
broadcast them all over the Internet. Take advantage of this immense, free
school of sales.
The real reason that top salespeople are so willing to share their “secrets” is
usually because everybody already knows the secrets. The real secret of top
salespeople is that they actually put into practice what every salesperson
knows she should be doing.
Tuning in with the Latest
Communication Tools
Twenty years ago, relatively few communications media were readily avail-
able — typically a phone and hand-delivered mail. Now you have access to
fax machines, cellphones, BlackBerries, e-mail, instant messaging, teleconfer-
encing, online seminars, blogs, conference call centers, voice mail, call for-
warding, and text messaging. With all of these options, you can remain in
contact with your customers 24/7, assuming, of course, that you take advan-
tage of these technologies.
In the following sections, I reveal the communications technologies you
should explore and offer some tips on how to maximize their effectiveness.
191
Chapter 12: Putting the Latest Technologies to Work for You
Tapping the power of pay-per-click advertising
As we were working on this chapter, Lois was
reading to me and typing away. I was on
another computer setting up Google AdWord
campaigns. Currently I have 21 campaigns run-
ning at a maximum of $10 per bid. 
For the last 90 days I had 2.5 million impressions
(number of times the ad appeared on Google or
a Google ad network), which led to 2,469 click-
throughs to my Web site. I captured 2,469 new
sales prospects for a total cost of 23 cents per
click through at a three-month cost of $555.
If I converted only 2 of the 2,400 that clicked
through, at a average commission of $7,500, that
would equal to $15,000. If I can convert 20 then
it equals $150,000.
This is definitely a great ROI (return on
investment).

Optimizing the power
of your phone system
If you finally traded in your pager for a cellphone, congratulations. You’re one
step closer to having the phone capabilities that customers expect in order
to contact you at a moment’s notice. You can do much more, however, to
pump up the power of your phone system and use it to generate more sales.
The following sections reveal some options you may want to consider.
Giving customers a toll-free number
Don’t discourage customers who live in other states or countries from calling
you by having them pay long-distance charges. Set up a toll-free line, so they
can call for free. This is particularly important if you’re a retailer. Giving cus-
tomers a quick and easy way to contact you builds trust and makes cus-
tomers more comfortable placing an order with you. 
One of the best features of a toll-free number is that it rings through to your
business number, so you don’t need a separate phone line. In addition, this
allows you to take the toll-free number with you if you move your business. 
Implementing automatic call forwarding
Just because you’re on the road doesn’t mean you’re out of touch. With call
forwarding you can have any incoming calls routed to whatever phone
number you choose — your home phone, cell number, or even the hotel
where you’re staying in Fiji.
Call your phone company to ask about call forwarding and other services they
offer. Phone companies are constantly developing new communications tech-
nologies and may have something available that you haven’t yet heard about.
Making your voicemail greeting more personal
When customers call or prospective customers return your calls, leave the
impression that their call is important to you by playing a special voicemail
greeting. Change the greeting daily or at least every week. Instead of using
the standard, “Hello, you’ve reached Plackard Industries, please leave a mes-
sage after the tone,” say something like, “Happy Valentine’s Day!” (or what-
ever day it is), let them know where you are, what you’re doing, when you’ll
be back in the office, and how they can contact you or someone who’s cover-
ing for you in the meantime.
My attorney, Ralph Margulis, from the Jaffe Raite Law firm is one of the best
at leaving detailed and timely greetings. He changes his greeting daily,
advises what his schedule is going to be for that day, and ends it with his
192
Part III: Equipping Yourself with Advanced Selling Tools and Resources 

famous sign-off, “And have a great day!” He tells you whether he’ll be out of
the office or has a lunch meeting. He tells you the best times to call. He men-
tions an emergency number. He doesn’t use a cellphone, but he always man-
ages to return calls fairly quickly.
In addition to recording an up-beat and memorable voicemail greeting, work
on the greeting you use when you answer the phone. “Hello?” Doesn’t cut it. If
the caller’s ID appears, greet the caller by name. Smile when you answer, so
you sound happy to hear from the person. Deliver a greeting that the person
is unlikely to hear from other salespeople, such as, “Mrs. Dithers! Thanks for
returning my call. What can I do for you today?”
Text-messaging customers and clients
Although I wouldn’t recommend carrying on a text messaging dialog with one
of your customers, text-messaging is a great way to enable your customers to
leave you a message . . . especially if your customers are more inclined to
type than talk. 
With text messaging, your customers or clients can send you a message using
their phones, instant messaging software on the their computers, or a wire-
less handheld device, such as a BlackBerry. They simply type the message
and instead of sending it via email, they send it to your phone.
Text messaging is sort of a combination of e-mail and instant messaging for
cellphones and portable wireless devices like BlackBerries. On a cellphone,
when you receive a text message, the phone typically rings a special tone to
indicate that you’ve received a text message. You can then select a special
menu option for checking text messages, read the message, and respond to it
using the buttons on your cellphone’s keypad.
Always accommodate your customer’s preferences, particularly in respect to
how they prefer to communicate. Some people love talking on the phone and
others hate it. As a salesperson, you should be comfortable with all commu-
nications media.
Adding a conference call center
Relatively recently, I installed a conference call center, so my clients, col-
leagues, and the people I coach can call in and meet one another. I can even
record the conference calls and have them transcribed or simply file them in
case the calls generate ideas that I may want to follow up on later.
The conference call center has been one of the best investments I have ever
made. I can even hold workshops over the phone with real estate agents from
across the country. They simply call the central number, enter a secret code
on their phone, state their name, and join in the meeting.

Chapter 12: Putting the Latest Technologies to Work for You

Improving e-mail efficiency
You probably know how to send and receive email messages, but you may
not be aware of all of the fancy features your e-mail program has that can
make your life easier, including the following:
 Filters: You can set up e-mail filters to have messages automatically
sorted for you into separate folders. You can then prioritize the mes-
sages you want to answer first. You can even filter out messages that will
only waste your time by having them sent to the Deleted Items folder.
 Groups: If you find yourself frequently sending the same messages to the
same people, consider creating a group that contains everyone’s e-mail
addresses. Instead of entering each address separately, you can send a
message to the group to have it distributed to everyone in that group.
Every week, I send out 9,000 messages to fellow real estate agents and other
contacts across the country. In these weekly messages, I usually offer some
valuable tip, something inspirational such as the movie 212 Degrees, or a holi-
day greeting. This is my way of giving back to the community whose support
I value so much. Although you may not want to send out 9,000 -email messages
every week, I encourage you to send something to everyone in your address
book at least once a month.
Hopping on the BlackBerry bandwagon
BlackBerries and similar portable wireless devices have led the charge of
what’s called Sales Force Automation (SFA). Equipped with wireless e-mail
and phone service, voicemail, GPS, and other features, it enables companies
to store information about customers in a central location and provide
remote access to that information to everyone in the company, particularly
the sales force. It also allows management to track its salespeople in the field.
Salespeople often resist any attempts by management to automate sales. They
don’t like having to hand over their client portfolios and share the information
they spent so much time gathering. They hate the fact that management can
trace their movements in the field via GPS. And many salespeople simply don’t
want to spend time learning how to use a new gadget — time they could be
using making sales and earning commissions.
I believe, however, that the benefits far outweigh the potential drawbacks:
 You can carry your contact information with you.
 You can send and receive e-mail on the road.
194
Part III: Equipping Yourself with Advanced Selling Tools and Resources 

 You can use your BlackBerry to talk on the phone.
 You can surf the Web without having to open your notebook computer.
 If a customer fails to show up for a meeting, you can connect to your
central office and find another prospect in the area to visit.
 If your customer does implement some SFA solution, you can compare
your performance to other salespeople at your company and discover
areas where you need to improve.
 You can find the closest Starbucks in the area — you can even get direc-
tions to it. Okay, maybe not essential, but I guess that depends on what a
cuppa joe can do for you.
BlackBerry devices can become addictive, so be careful. These gadgets are
referred to as CrackBerries for a reason.
Keeping in touch with instant messaging
Because I’m on the road a good deal of the time, I rarely use instant messag-
ing to keep in touch with clients, but many salespeople who sell primarily
from their computers find that instant messaging (or IMing) is an excellent
communications tool. 
With an instant messaging program, such as AOL Instant Messenger (AIM),
Yahoo! Chat, or iChat, you can communicate via computer and the Internet
with someone on the other side of the world instantly . . . assuming you both
have computers and compatible instant messaging programs. These pro-
grams have become sophisticated enough to handle not only text messages
but also voice and video.
You can continue working on your computer with your IM program running
in the background, and when a customer sends you an instant message,
you’re automatically notified of its receipt. You can then type and send the
person a message, call the person on the phone, or even teleconference with
the customer, as explained in the following section.
Teleconferencing over the Internet
Teleconferencing hasn’t quite achieved the promise it had in the Jetsons, but
with the Internet, it’s getting closer and closer. With your computer, a high-
speed Internet connection, and the right software, you can now teleconfer-
ence with clients and colleagues from all around the world. 
195
Chapter 12: Putting the Latest Technologies to Work for You

One of the most exciting video teleconferencing companies I’ve seen lately is
Extreme Video. It features a product called High Speed Video’s Video Meeting,
which can connect business locations from around the world. The broadband
connections enable on-demand teleconferencing at broadcast quality, so you
can call meetings on the spur of the moment and feel as though you’re actu-
ally sitting in the same room as the people you’re talking to. For additional
details, visit Extreme Video at extremevideo.us.
I mention Extreme Video as a communications technology that’s on the hori-
zon. During the writing of this book, it wasn’t exactly a mainstream product for
your average salesperson, but there was a time, if you can believe it, when not
all salespeople carried cellphones and you couldn’t get broadband Internet at
the airport. Video teleconferencing may seem like Jetson’s material, but it’s
going to be here sooner than you may think.

Picking the Right People
to Fill the Gaps 
In This Chapter
 Spotting opportunities to outsource your workload
 Building a systems-based sales staff
 Hiring great people and treating them right
 Firing slackers and incompetents 
 Beefing up your staff with virtual assistants
T
he “Me” generation fooled us into thinking that we were independent
beings — masters of our own destiny able to achieve success without
the assistance of others. This sort of thinking limits your upside, which
clamps a lid on your goals. With limited people power, you limit your time
and availability to pursue other, potentially more lucrative and more intrigu-
ing opportunities. 
The fact is that you are not just you. You are the sum total of you and all of
your relationships. By tapping the power of other people, you expand your
potential exponentially. You quickly discover that you can do anything,
because what you can’t do, you can find someone to do it for you . . . and usu-
ally faster, better, and more affordably than you can do it yourself. 
In this chapter, I lead you through the process of identifying your limitations,
choosing the tasks you find most enjoyable and profitable, and hiring out
the rest. 
Generally speaking, salespeople are good at building relationships. That’s pri-
marily your job, what you should be best at. Hire out all the other tasks,
including marketing, Web site or blog design, filing, and so on.

Identifying Outsourcing Opportunities
Throughout this book, I tell you to do about 6,000 more things than you’re
already doing. You’re probably thinking at this point, “Is this Ralph R. Roberts
guy for real? Is there one salesperson on the planet who could possibly put
all these suggestions into action?” You’ may even be wondering whether I
practice what I preach. Maybe I’m just all talk. Maybe I’m one of those over-
paid sales consultant guru types who’s never really sold anything.
Well, I’m here to tell you that I do practice what I preach. I do everything I
recommend in this book . . . well, I sort of do it all. Actually, I pay a lot of
people to do much of it for me. And you can do the same thing. You just have
to figure out what nobody other than you can do, determine what you really
love doing, and then hire out the rest.
In the following sections, I show you how to identify responsibilities you can
outsource to increase your own productivity and job satisfaction.
Taking inventory of everything
that needs to get done
Today, preferably right now, I want you to jot down a list of job responsibilities
and tasks you must complete. You can divide your list into work-related and
non-work-related items. Why am I including non-work-related items? Because
to optimize your schedule, you have to be ready, willing, and able to delegate
tasks in both your personal and professional life.
198
Part III: Equipping Yourself with Advanced Selling Tools and Resources 
Get ’er done
Salespeople who feel constantly overwhelmed
by how much they have to do and how little time
they have to do it often make the mistake of think-
ing in the first person. “I have to do this. I have to
do that. If I don’t have this report done by Friday,
I’ll be working all weekend.” Blah, blah, blah.
True, all of these things need to be done, but that
doesn’t mean you have to do them. If somebody
else does it, it still gets done, but without your
having to spend time and energy doing it.
Drop the “I” and start thinking in the passive
voice... “this needs to get done, that needs to
get done, this report needs to be finished, this
customer needs to be contacted,” and so on. By
thinking in the passive voice, you take on less of
the burden and focus on the tasks at hand.
Identify the tasks, hire people to do them, dele-
gate, and then do what you’re best at and what
you enjoy.
Remember, “Get ’er done,” doesn’t mean you
have to do it.

Your list can include everything from large projects to the tiniest tasks. You
may include answering the phone, checking e-mail messages, cleaning house,
picking up your kids from school, making lunch, brewing coffee, cooking, visit-
ing with clients, creating presentations, running errands, and so on. Draw up a
preliminary list and then add to it as you notice yourself performing different
tasks. I want you to know everything you do in a typical day, week, or month.
To make this task a little easier, think of it as though you are in the process of
creating a time budget. Instead of finding out where you spend every penny,
find out how you spend every minute.
Highlighting tasks that 
only you can perform
When you have a comprehensive list of things you do in hand (from the pre-
vious section), highlight all of the tasks and projects that you and only you
can perform. Start with the easy ones like eating, sleeping, and exercising,
and then work your way toward more complicated tasks, such as visiting new
prospects, coming up with ideas for new advertising and marketing cam-
paigns, and creating reports and presentations. 
Before highlighting an item that’s in a gray area, ask yourself, “Am I really the
only person who could do this?” If you can honestly answer “Yes,” then go
ahead and highlight it.
You’re searching for the maximum number of tasks you can delegate, so go
easy with the highlighter.
Highlighting tasks you love doing
Hold on, don’t put that highlighter away just yet. Go back over the list and
highlight the tasks that you love to do. Maybe you enjoy mowing the lawn or
washing the dishes. Perhaps you find folding laundry therapeutic. You love
coaching your kid’s soccer team and baking cookies for the school. Go ahead
and highlight all those activities. If you love doing it, highlight it.
This isn’t an exercise in maximizing your time at work or removing all enjoy-
ment from your life. The ultimate goal is to make your life more enjoyable
and rewarding by outsourcing all but the most enjoyable, fulfilling, dollar-
generating tasks.
Pinpointing what you hate doing
As a child, you probably felt very comfortable expressing your dislike for cer-
tain activities. Maybe you hated doing the dishes, cleaning your room, or
199
Chapter 13: Picking the Right People to Fill the Gaps

doing your homework. Chances are, you were probably pretty vocal about it,
and if you could get away with not doing those things, you would.
What’s funny is that as adults, we become much less vocal about the things
we hate to do and much less determined to avoid them, even though we have
much more power to delegate them to someone else. If you’re like most
adults, you just “suck it up” and do what you feel you have to do. But sucking
it up isn’t the best way to accomplish anything. In fact, it usually leads to
mediocre results.
Return to that list of tasks you perform and place a star next to all the tasks
you hate doing:
 Tasks you know you hate doing: If you find yourself saying “Ugh!” at the
mere mention of the task, put a star next to it.
 Tasks you avoid: If you find yourself constantly putting off a certain task
and doing something less important instead, you really don’t like to do
it, no matter what your brain tells you. Another good indication that you
don’t like doing something is that you’re constantly making up excuses
for not having it done.
 Tasks you dread: If you break out in a cold sweat or hives or have hot
flashes just thinking about having to get started on something, you may
need to delegate it or at least find assistance in doing it.
 Anything that bores you: If something bores you, it sucks the energy
right out of you, and you shouldn’t be doing it.

My first assistant
The first assistant I hired answered the phones.
I was working in a real estate office, and we
took turns on phone duty. I dreaded the time
when my turn would come up, because I hated
sitting at a desk waiting for the phone to ring. I
wanted to be out there selling houses.
Instead of doing a job I didn’t like and that was
actually costing me money in missed opportu-
nities, I hired a high school girl to take my place.
She was perfectly capable of answering the
phone and taking messages, and she had a
great phone voice. Clients probably preferred
calling and hearing her voice rather than mine,
and she loved it. She could sit at the desk and
do her homework or her nails or whatever wait-
ing for the phone to ring.
After hiring this first assistant, I haven’t stopped.
I know exactly what I need to attend to person-
ally and what others can handle in my place,
and I farm out as much of the work as I can.
Remember, one of the best services you can
provide to another human being who needs a
job and income is to hire them.

Taking inventory of missing skills
Whenever you notice that certain tasks are not being completed on a timely
basis, are not done as well as they could be, or you and everyone around you
feels overwhelmed by the amount of work that’s piling up, you should be
looking for opportunities to hire someone full or part time to take on some
of the work.
Even when you’re not in the market for an employee, you should remain on
the lookout for any new talent that may assist you in boosting business. Here
are some areas you may want to focus on:
 A marketing maven to design and product marketing materials with
more pop and sizzle
 Someone to design a newsletter and make sure each issue contains valu-
able content.
 A computer whiz who can handle Web site and blog design and manage-
ment along with assisting you when you experience technical difficulties.
 A receptionist to handle phone calls, light filing, and perhaps even screen-
ing e-mail messages to call your attention to the most important ones.
Create a list of items you keep putting off or are struggling to get done. If you
already have an assistant or two or three, have them add to the list, so you
can identify the areas where you need the most help. Hiring someone who is
proficient in the areas where you need some assistance will be well worth the
money in the end.
Tabulating time-wasting tasks
Another great way to identify outsourcing opportunities is to highlight the
biggest time-wasting activities you’re involved in over the course of a week. I
know, you’re probably thinking “sales meetings,” but time wasters usually
include much more than unproductive meetings. 
To analyze where your timewasters are, maintain a calendar for an entire work
week, either on paper or on your computer. Make a note of everything you do
and how long it takes you. This may seem like a big timewaster itself, but even-
tually, this investment is going to pay dividends. Log every hour for a week. At
the end of the week, review your log and mark any of the following activities:
 Putting out fires
 Spending unproductive time on the Internet
 Wrestling with technology you have no idea how to use
 Pursuing distractions
 Procrastinating
201
Chapter 13: Picking the Right People to Fill the Gaps

 Performing tasks not out of necessity but only because you feel
responsible
 Anything someone else could have done better, faster, or for less per
hour than you earn
 Organizing — sorting, filing, deleting, throwing away, cleaning
 Looking for something — files, folders, supplies, people
 Waiting for someone to arrive, call, or meet you somewhere
Some of these timewasters, such as pursuing distractions, are things that you
have to purge from your day through discipline. I can’t help you with those.
The rest of the tasks are candidates for delegation.

Designing your own Web site may not be 
the best use of your time
Kandra Hamric, one of my top virtual assistants
who happened to contribute a great deal to the
development of this chapter, built her own Web
site. She thought it would be a fun, educational
experience . . . a nice little weekend project.
Well, as she tells the story, it didn’t quite end up
that way, but it did turn out well in the end:
“When I first started my business as a virtual
assistant for real estate businesses, I thought
I could build a Web site. I figured it couldn’t
be that hard. I went out and bought myself a
copy of Microsoft’s Front Page. It took me a
couple of days to figure out how the software
worked, but I felt that I had a pretty good
understanding of it, and away I went. 
“I started creating what I thought was going
to be one of the best Web sites on the net.
Boy, was I was wrong! I couldn’t for the life of
me figure out why my site looked different on
different computers. I couldn’t get everything
to fit on one screen. Visitors were pulling up
pages and hitting dead ends. And my site
wasn’t even showing up in search engines
because I had no idea what SEO (Search
Engine Optimization) or “keywords” were or
how to go about improving my site’s ranking.
“Over the course of several months and with
the assistance of some tech-savvy col-
leagues, I honed my skills. I have a great
looking site, mastered Front Page and Dream
Weaver, and am now into Open Source.
“The moral of the story is this: If you don’t
have the skills to produce something worth
showing people, you have two options: get
the skills or get somebody with the skills.
Because I’m in the business of using tech-
nology to support my clients, learning how
to build and maintain a Web site was in my
long-term best interest, but for you as a
salesperson, it may not be. You’re likely to
lose more on commissions than if you
simply hired a skilled web designer.”
I have over 200 Web sites and blogs. I love the
technology. I enjoy seeing my articles posted
online and having visitors comment on them.
Did I create them? No. Do I manage them? No.
I hire people who are more skilled at building
and managing these sites. I enable them to do
what they do best by providing them with com-
pensation, and they give me what I need —
highly attractive and functional Web sites and
blogs that attract a lot of attention.

Designing an Efficient System
Every business I own has a system in place complete with sub-systems for
divisions or departments within my business. This is how most corporations
are managed, as well, and how you should manage your business as an entre-
preneurial salesperson. 
A system typically includes the following key components:
 Goal: The stated objective. What you plan to accomplish.
 Strategy: An overall idea of how your business is going to achieve the
stated goal.
 Tasks: Everything that needs to be done to launch and manage the
business.
 Personnel: Skilled and unskilled personnel to carry out the daily
operations.
 Resources: Equipment and supplies required.
 Budget: Money needed to pay for everything.
You’re not exactly starting your own business venture, so you don’t have to
create a formal, detailed business plan, but you should take a systems
approach in building and managing your personal sales staff (you and your
assistants). Everyone should be aware of the goal and the tasks they are
responsible for.
By developing a system for getting things done, you can be much more effec-
tive and efficient in hiring the requisite talent and then providing them with
the training they need to carry out essential tasks.
You already know what you want your business to accomplish, and you have
a pretty good grasp of the tasks that must be performed to accomplish your
goals. The next challenge is to break tasks into steps and then assign tasks to
the individuals who are best able to perform them, as discussed in the follow-
ing sections.
Breaking tasks into steps
Document (or hire someone to document) every task you perform. Create a
mini, step-by-step instruction manual for each task that’s detailed enough so
just about anyone can perform it. Leave nothing to question. The more
detailed the steps, the fewer questions you have to field later. Include photos,
illustrations, and other visuals, to make the information accessible to people
with different learning styles. 
203
Chapter 13: Picking the Right People to Fill the Gaps

Store a copy of your step-by-step instruction manuals in an easily accessible
binder. You may also want to store a copy electronically on a central com-
puter, assuming your office is networked. Be sure to update your instruction
manuals when procedures change.
Consider creating a master binder containing all tasks. You may want to
divide tasks by “department” or job title to make them easier to access.
Assigning tasks to assistants
After you have all of your tasks documented, assigning individual tasks to
assistants is relatively easy, even if the person is a new hire or a temp. You
simply delegate the task and point the person to the instruction manual.
From there, the person should be able to figure out the rest . . . assuming, of
course, you provided sufficient details in the manual. Of course, I’m assuming
here that you have an assistant. If you don’t, skip to “Hiring and Firing” or
“Scaling Your Work Force with Virtual Assistant,” later in this chapter.
As your mini-business becomes larger, you may opt for a more structured
approach. You can assemble your instruction manuals into separate binders
for specific job titles, perhaps one for your receptionist, another for your
marketing coordinator, and your personal assistant.
You can go about planning an efficient system in either of two ways: Do it
yourself with the assistance of any people you currently have on staff, or hire
someone to come into your office and design a systems manual for you.
However you choose to do it, you are likely to be involved in the early stages
of identifying tasks that need to be performed.
Targeting specific projects
When you have a specific project to accomplish, such as setting up a new
Web site, redesigning your marketing materials, launching a drip e-mail cam-
paign, or installing a new automated phone system, take a systems approach
to plan and complete the project:
1. Set a goal.
2. Specify a deadline.
3. Identify individual tasks that must be accomplished. (If you’re creating
your first blog, for example, you may need someone to design a logo,
design the site, provide content, obtain a domain name, find a company
to host the blog, figure out how to promote it, and add personnel to
handle the increased number of sales calls and contacts.)
204
Part III: Equipping Yourself with Advanced Selling Tools and Resources 

4. Assign specific tasks to the people who are most capable of perform-
ing those tasks.
Designing and implementing systems to perform daily tasks or complete new
projects simplifies the process of managing and growing your mini-business
by making it more modular. Each individual or group of individuals has one
or more very manageable tasks to perform rather than having to do every-
thing. If you implement a systems approach, you soon find that your office
runs like clockwork, and you’re wasting less time stamping out fires.
Hiring and Firing
You know what needs to be done, you know how it needs to be done, but
you’re missing the who — who is going to do it? You’re working with a skele-
ton crew, and that skeleton crew is you. At this point, you need some staff, at
least one person, full or part time, who can pick up the slack.
As a salesperson, you may not feel ready to play the role of personnel direc-
tor for your personal sales staff, but that’s exactly the role you need to play
in order to staff up. In the following sections, I offer some guidance on how to
hire the right people and fire the wrong ones.
Don’t be in too much of a hurry when you’re hiring someone to take on some of
the workload. Spend some time reviewing resumes, interviewing, and checking
references. You want someone who’s a good fit, is going to stick around, and is
a team player — someone who’s willing to play a supportive role and doesn’t
want your job. You are going to invest time and money training this person, so
pick a prospect who promises a handsome return on your investment.
Recruiting top-notch personnel
I’m always in the process of recruiting talented individuals to work with me and
for me, and I often find them simply by bumping into them in the course of
doing what I do. My secret, if you can call it a secret, for attracting top-notch
talent is to be top notch. I provide the opportunities, tools, and direction to
execute potentially profitable business ventures that people want to play a role
in. I dress the part, play the part, and offer people real value. In exchange, they
offer me their talent.
When I need to fill a specific position, however, I often have to go head-hunting,
which is a little more difficult. It requires placing and ad, collecting resumes,
and interviewing candidates. In the following sections, I lead your through the
process.
205
Chapter 13: Picking the Right People to Fill the Gaps

Creating a job description
Before you can even think about placing an Help Wanted ad in the local news-
paper, you’d better have some idea of the position you want the person to fill.
Write up a job description, complete with a job title and a list of responsibili-
ties. For details on creating job titles, see “Assigning meaningful job titles,”
later in this chapter.
If the person is going to be your marketing coordinator, for example, you may
need the person to create and manage your Web sites and blogs, coordinate
interviews with reporters, design marketing materials, produce copy for
newsletters, manage your email campaigns, and so on.
Make the job description as detailed as possible. You want a candidate who’s
qualified to carry out as many of the tasks as you need done. 
Advertising the position
When you’re in the market for a talented employee, you want to attract as
many qualified candidates as possible, and to accomplish that feat, you have
to advertise the position. 
Start with the local newspaper. Post a Help Wanted ad that includes the fol-
lowing information:
 A brief statement of who you are or what you do, such as “Local
Salesperson” or “Car Sales” or “Software Sales”
 The job title
 A brief description of the type of person you’re looking for, such as
“organized” and “energetic”
 A brief description of the main job responsibilities
 A fax number or P.O. box number where you want applications and
resumes sent
Don’t include your phone number or address, unless you want to be inun-
dated with phone calls and visits. Have applications and resumes faxed to
you or mailed to a specific P.O. box. This gives you time to review the appli-
cations and pre-screen for promising candidates. 
Consider posting your want ad in several places, including online job sites,
such as www.CarreerBuilder.com and www.Monster.com, which adver-
tise both locally and nationally.
Preparing for the interviews
After you receive the majority of job applications, start sorting through 
the stack. Highlight the top 15 to 20 applicants, and start calling to set up
206
Part III: Equipping Yourself with Advanced Selling Tools and Resources 

interviews. You can pitch the remaining applications or hold on to any you
may be interested in following up on to fill future positions.
Schedule no more than three interviews in a given day. You want to have in-
depth interviews, so do fewer interviews better.
When scheduling the interview pay close attention to the person’s voice on
the phone. You can learn a lot by someone’s phone mannerisms. If they are
upbeat and motivated when they answer, they’re likely to be upbeat and
motivated in the office and in the presence of clients. If the person sounds as
though she’s just going through the motions, make a note, so you can follow
up on that during the interview.
Prior to the interview, you may want to do some preparation to determine
which candidates hold the most promise for a perfect fit. Here are some
options to consider:
 Develop some way of testing candidates to determine whether they are
qualified to perform certain tasks, such as typing, writing ad copy, and
so on. 
 Require that candidates take an online skills assessment test on a Web
site such as www.BrainBench.com. 
 Assess each candidate’s compatibility with the personality type that
would be best to fill the position. Several companies offer online person-
ality profiling based on the DISC method — Dominance, Influence,
Steadiness, and Conscientiousness. 
Salespeople are often extroverts who tend to hire extroverts even when what
they really need to fill a certain position is an introvert. Hiring someone of
like kind can often be a big mistake that results in major personality conflicts
later down the road.
Interviewing promising candidates
When you’re unaccustomed to interviewing candidates for employment, you
may not even know which questions to ask. Here are some key questions to
get the conversation going:
Are you currently employed? Why are you looking to leave your current
employer?
What do you feel is your biggest accomplishment in life?
What are your future goals?
What was your worst customer service experience and how would you
have handled it differently?

Chapter 13: Picking the Right People to Fill the Gaps

During the interview take note of some important qualities you should be
looking for:
 Did the person smile while talking? 
 Is the candidate a problem solver or a problem creator?
 Is the person’s ultimate goal to take your position? 
 How well did the person perform on any tests or tasks you had them do?
Never hire on the first interview. Take your time and interview all the candi-
dates to see what they all offer, then narrow your list down again for a second
interview. This process does take time, but is going to result in the hiring of a
superior employee.
Assigning meaningful job titles
Everyone you hire is essentially your assistant, but they probably don’t want
to think of themselves as an “assistant.” After work, they’re going go out with
their friends or home to their families, and somebody is going to ask, “What
do you do?” They don’t want to say, “I’m so-and-so’s assistant.” Your employ-
ees need titles that give them a sense of purpose and self-respect, something
that conveys a sense that they play key roles in your organization. Here are
some job titles you may want to consider: 
 Public Relations Liaison
 Director of Sales
 Director of Marketing
 Director of Operations
 Senior Sales Manager
 Client Care Manager
 Executive Assistant
 Business Manager
 Senior Business Developer
 Customer Service Supervisor
When you start looking for someone to fill a position, dangling an elite title
often draws more and better candidates. Advertising a position for Executive
Office Manager sounds a lot better than advertising for a Receptionist. In
addition, when a client calls and wants to talk to someone in charge, they
would probably rather talk to the Customer Service Supervisor rather than to
a Customer Service Representative.

Empowering your personnel and letting go
Salespeople tend to be overachieving control freaks. I know, because I’m one
of them, but micromanaging won’t further your business or sales goals. In
order to be a top salesperson, do what you do best and enable your staff to
do what they do best:
 Trust your judgment in hiring qualified personnel.
 Let go of any thoughts that “nobody can do it better than me,” “my way
is best,” and “my way or the highway.” 
 Give your employees the tools and resources they need to do the job
right.
 Empower your employees to make decisions, and then don’t question
every decision they make. You don’t want to have a staff that’s always
waiting around for approval and afraid to pull the trigger and make a
decision.
 Involve your employees in setting the direction and goals for the com-
pany and for themselves. Employees who have a sense of ownership in
the company are more likely to be highly motivated and offer sugges-
tions for positive change.
If you micromanage your business, you essentially have a stranglehold on it
that can choke the very creativity and energy out of your staff that you need
to succeed. Anyone who begins to feel as though they are wasting their time
and creative energy is going to be spending more energy developing an exit
strategy. You don’t want your employees to have one foot out of the boat,
you want then to be rowing the boat with you. 
Rewarding productive personnel
People don’t generally work for the sheer pleasure of it. They usually need or
want something — money, status, power, benefits, a pat on the back, and
often a combination of all of the above. To retain your best people and moti-
vate them to give you 100 percent, you have to reward them in some way.
Here are some suggestions to add to your incentive program:
 Pay raises based on performance
 Bonuses, to show them that the more successful you are, the more suc-
cessful they are
 Praise, both verbal and in writing 
 A thank-you card showing that you recognize their efforts 
 Employee of the month plaques and special recognition
209
Chapter 13: Picking the Right People to Fill the Gaps

 Dinner on the boss
 Special parking privileges
 An extra hour for lunch
 A gift card to a favorite restaurant or store
 A spotlight in the company newsletter 
 More freedom and responsibility
 Free or subsidized classes to improve their job skills and stimulate their
minds 
 A fun office environment where it doesn’t even feel like work 
Some people work for the sheer pleasure of working, others for money, some
for titles, and others for praise. Find out what motivates each of your employ-
ees and give them what they value most.
Knowing when to fire an employee
When an employee just isn’t working out, you first have to determine
whether it’s his fault or your fault. You may have hired an incompetent
slacker by mistake, the person may have undisclosed problems outside of
work, or perhaps you failed to provide essential training and resources. 
Before you send your employee packing, ask yourself the following questions:
Has the person been trained adequately by me or by another knowledge-
able staff member?
Am I expecting too much? Reducing the person’s workload or allowing
more time to complete tasks may result in better performance.
Do other staff members view this person as an asset to the company?
Maybe your estimate of the person’s value is off.
Are communication lines open? Maybe the person feels as though she
can’t talk with you.
Can the office function without this person?
Does this person have all the tools and resources she needs to do her job?
Is something going on that I don’t know about? Before pointing blame,
ask questions. Don’t make a snap judgment or decision based on false or
missing information. Describe your dissatisfaction and ask questions.
The person may be struggling with serious personal issues.
Don’t set up an employee to fail by not providing the proper training and
resources to do the job well and then blame the employee. If you haven’t
empowered the person, that’s your fault, not theirs.
210
Part III: Equipping Yourself with Advanced Selling Tools and Resources 

Although employees often have valid reasons for performing poorly on the
job, they often have no good reason. These are the employees you need to
fire, and the sooner, the better. To stay on the safe side, legally speaking, con-
sult your attorney before firing anyone on your staff. The following list
describes some common grounds for firing an employee:
 Steals from the company
 Draws negative attention to the company through words or deeds
 Doesn’t pay attention to problems that keep recurring
 Procrastinates to the point of missing deadlines — shows no sense of
urgency in respect to deadlines
 Takes no initiative — never volunteers for anything
 Becomes annoyed and confrontational when someone disagrees
 Requires constant supervision and reminders 
 Rarely or never takes work home to meet fast approaching deadlines
 Doesn’t take advantage of additional training or educational opportunities
 Blames others when things don’t quite go right
 Consistently late or tardy for work
 Fails to attend or participate in office meetings 
 Resists necessary changes to office procedures 
 Socializes or gossips too much in the office
 Drags down office morale with a persistent negative attitude
 Criticizes or allows criticism of the company
 Refuses to adhere to the policies you’ve communicated to the staff
 Constantly pushes work off onto other staff members 
Few people enjoy firing others, but you have to fire people who fail to fulfill
the job requirements. If you won’t do it for yourself, do it for the rest of your
staff members who are hard working and conscientious. 
Scaling Your Work Force 
with Virtual Assistants
You don’t always have to hire full- or part-time staff to work in-house. You can
staff up with virtual assistants, instead. Virtual assistants are freelancers who
generally market their services on the Internet — that’s where the “virtual”
part comes from. They can do everything from processing forms to designing
211
Chapter 13: Picking the Right People to Fill the Gaps

and managing Web sites to processing payroll and doing your taxes. And
because they’re freelancers, you simply buy as much work as you need and
pay a flat hourly fee or by-project fee. You don’t have to worry about paying
taxes, offering additional benefits, or paying for vacations.
Most virtual assistants specialize in a certain field — writing, editing, Web
design, transcription, database management, accounting, you name it. Each
assistant typically has specialized training and all the resources required to
perform a task better and more efficiently and affordably than you can do it
yourself. They can be retained for one-time jobs or become an integral part of
your team, devoting a certain number of hours to your business every month. 
Following are some of the many benefits that virtual assistants offer:
 You pay only for the time the assistant works for you.
 You don’t have to constantly find tasks to keep the person busy.
 You don’t withhold payroll taxes or pay into unemployment.
 You don’t pay for insurance or other benefits.
 They don’t take paid sick days, holidays, or vacation days.
 They come fully equipped, so you have no overhead on office space or
additional equipment.
 You don’t have to fire them if they fail to perform — you just find some-
one else.
Perhaps the biggest benefit of using virtual assistants is that they enable you
to scale your business immediately when business conditions change. You
can scale up when you have more work to do and scale back when business
tapers off. When you have in-house employees, you can’t simply fire and
rehire at a moment’s notice, and you end up with constant overhead.
According to the 2nd annual survey by America Online and Salary.com in
2006, the average worker admitted to squandering 1.86 hours per 8-hour
workday, not including lunch and scheduled break-time, which is down from
2.09 hours in 2005.

Association at www.ivaa.org and the Virtual Real Estate Assistant blog at

Harnessing People Power 
with R-Commerce
In This Chapter
 Building long-term success with an R-Commerce strategy
 Connecting the four C’s of R-Commerce
 Establishing connections before you need them
 Leveraging the power of your R-Commerce network
 Strengthening relationships with your clientele
I
n sales, the word “commerce” refers to exchanging goods and services
typically with some sort of currency involved. Market conditions define
the value of a product or service, and the value of everything that changes
hands can be measured and quantified. You can measure the success of a
business by examining its profit and loss statement. You can estimate an
employee’s worth by looking at productivity. You can even rank the value of
your customers by the amount of revenue they bring in.
Underlying this quantifiable commerce is another commerce — R-Commerce
(Relationship-Commerce). R-Commerce is the power that fuels the exchange
of goods and services. Although it’s not something you can easily measure,
it’s the force that generates new ideas, draws people together to execute
those ideas, and functions as the infrastructure for advertising, marketing,
and distributing the products and services spawned from those ideas. Yet,
salespeople and other business professionals often limit their opportunities
by focusing too much on commerce and not enough on R-Commerce.
In this chapter, I reveal the secret of R-Commerce — a powerful networking
concept developed by business consultant and visionary Terry Brock — to
refocus your attention and energy on the qualitative components of success.
Here you discover how to establish synergistic relationships that ultimately
deliver measurable results in the form of increased sales and profits.

Embracing the R-Commerce Philosophy
Those who build sales on the R-Commerce model are less like hunters and
more like farmers. They invest time in learning the land, cultivating the soil,
and nurturing prospects. They may not see the fruits of their labor for sev-
eral months or several years, and some of the relationships they cultivate
may not bear fruit, but over time, they reap a bountiful harvest and spend
very little time chasing down leads.
In the following sections, I reveal why R-Commerce is so critical to your suc-
cess and show you how to shift your thinking to focus less on your bottom
line and more on building productive and profitable relationships.
Exploring R-Commerce applications
Entertaining the concept of an economy built on the foundation of relation-
ships may seem like a time-wasting intellectual exercise devised by some 
professor of business who took many sociology classes, but it actually has
several practical applications, including the following:
 Generating ideas: People from complementary and sometimes even
contradictory fields or disciplines can often collaborate to inspire one
another to invent the next big thing. 
 Boosting productivity: Strengthening relationships among coworkers
and between management and employees motivates everyone to work
together to build a more positive and productive workplace. 
 Increasing sales: Making your customers more successful typically
results in increased sales, as your customers grow their businesses and
expose you to new opportunities. Chapter 18 shows you how to focus on
your customer’s success.
 Streamlining operations: R-Commerce is often the driving force behind
mergers. Competitors may realize that by combining their companies,
they can slash costs. When I was considering moving my office, I con-
tacted a colleague who owns a business that offers complementary real
estate services. In addition to saving on the cost of the building and
other resources, we hope to generate business for one another. 
 Combining strengths: Individuals or companies with specialties that
complement one another can often capitalize on relationships that bene-
fit both partners.
216
Part IV: Prospecting for Sales Opportunities 

 Improving scalability: Relationships can develop and dissolve as
needed to provide expertise and resources on-demand, enabling small
businesses to act like big businesses and vice versa. 
 Adapting to change: In the fast-paced global economy, change ripples
through the system like a lightning bolt. You can’t stay on top of these
changes by yourself. Having relationships with people in numerous,
diverse fields enables you to spot impending change earlier, adapt more
quickly, and seize new opportunities. 
R-Commerce is often driven by mutually beneficial partnerships. When look-
ing for productive partnership candidates, consider anyone you would like to
sell your product or services to and anyone you would like to receive refer-
rals from. 
217
Chapter 14: Harnessing People Power with R-Commerce
Noting the importance of R-Commerce 
My friend and colleague, international speaker
and business consultant Terry Brock witnessed
the negative effects that result when compa-
nies overlook the importance of R-Commerce.
Terry shares his story:
“In college, I worked for Goodyear Tire and
Rubber Company as a member of United
Rubber Workers Local 185 in Jackson,
Michigan. I had a union job . . . great bene-
fits, super salary, and a relatively secure
position, just like many of my coworkers. 
Yet, throughout my time at the company, I
never once heard any of the union members
express a desire to help the company
achieve greater profitability, greater respect
in the community, or anything positive. The
prevailing attitude was ‘company bad, union
good,’ and most of the workers invested
most of their time trying to think up ways of
getting more out of the big, bad corporation.
Those who were with the company the
longest and had the highest salaries and
best benefit packages were the worst,
having little else to say about the company
than, ‘Well, they’ve got us by the beanies.’
Job security worked against the health of
the company. Employees had no incentive
to improve intellectually or acquire new
skills. They thought they were doing the
company a favor simply by showing up on
time and putting in their eight hours a day.
The only time they took some initiative was
to file a grievance with their union rep if
anything went wrong.
The attitude was not one to foster an atmos-
phere of innovation and productivity. It
simply generated animosity, which ulti-
mately hurt the business and everyone who
benefited from that business. This same
sort of thing is what’s destroying the U.S.
auto industry.”
As Terry points out, R-Commerce is what drives
success. Without a strong foundation of R-
Commerce, a business is almost destined to fail.
It may survive for a short time, but eventually it
won’t be able to compete against companies who
build stronger, more productive relationships.

Retooling your mind
Refocusing your sales strategy on something as vague as relationships
requires a fairly large shift in how you think about business. Toss out any
concerns you may have about profit margins, sales quotas, and revenue.
Think about building relationships. Think customer service. Treat everyone
you meet as a partner — someone you can potentially team up with in a way
that raises you both to a new level.
To build your sales career on the R-Commerce model requires patience and
persistence. Don’t expect an immediate payoff for your efforts. In fact, you
may invest in several relationships that provide you with no observable ben-
efit. Over time, however, you begin to see real progress. Focus on building
productive relationships. Increased commissions and job satisfaction natu-
rally follow. Be prepared to give R-Commerce time to work.
Discovering the Four C’s of R-Commerce
When you think of R-Commerce in terms of sales, most people naturally think
“customer.” That’s only one of the four “C” words that apply to R-Commerce.
The other three are “company,” “colleagues,” and “community.” As a sales-
person, tending to relationships in all four C categories builds the strongest
R-Commerce foundation for future success:
 Company: What’s good for your company is good for your customers,
colleagues, and community, and for you, as well. Look for opportunities
to improve your company’s success.
 Colleagues: Your colleagues include everyone you work for and with
and anyone who works for you. Do whatever you can to surround your-
self with the best people, and then make them better.
 Customers (or clients): Every customer who fails is a customer lost.
Team up with your customers to make them as successful as they can
be. As I show you in Chapter 18, this doesn’t mean simply placating
them. A customer or client often needs to be challenged to make a posi-
tive change.
 Community: Dynamic, vibrant communities are places where people
want to invest and spend money. People want to do business with
people they trust, people who are known in the community and working
to effect positive changes. By investing time and resources in building
and bettering communities, you build a dynamic, ever-growing con-
sumer base, while making the world a better place. 
218
Part IV: Prospecting for Sales Opportunities 

When I talk about building communities, I’m not only talking about building
communities in the real world. I’m also talking about online communities. I
host a blog called Macomb County Voice (macombcountyvoice.com) where
I invite others from my community to participate in a positive way.
With an R-Commerce mindset, you realize that money doesn’t define an
economy. The flow of money is simply a measure of how healthy the real
economy, R-Commerce, really is. 
Getting Well Connected
To be successful in the new R-Commerce economy, networking is key. It
enables you to establish connections and discover a never-ending supply of
leads simply by talking to people, letting them know what you do, and then
kicking back and letting your network work for you. 
Where do you start? A better question would be “Where don’t you start.” I
network constantly, everywhere I go. Whether I’m rubbing elbows with col-
leagues at a convention, eating out with my family, buying a car, or attending
a ball game, I’m meeting people and building relationships. As a salesperson,
you should be doing the same.
219
Chapter 14: Harnessing People Power with R-Commerce
Join or start a Meetup
A Meetup is a group of people who live in the
same geographical area and gather regularly in
an informal setting to share a common interest.
You can go online at Meetup.com, search for a
topic of interest, find a group of people in your
area that share your interests, and find out the
location and time of the next meeting. If no
Meetup group exists, you can create your own.
Meetup groups cover every interest imaginable,
from learning a foreign language to acquiring
technical expertise or business skills. If you’re
living in Central Florida, for example, and are
interested in learning Russian, you can join a
group started by Jef Gray, a guy who works at
the local utility company. The group meets regu-
larly, usually monthly, at a restaurant or other
location in a local community. Jef’s wife, Lena,
a Russian immigrant, has teamed up with Jef to
organize the group and plan meetings and other
activities. Students of the Russian language can
meet with Russian immigrants and others inter-
ested in Russian language and culture to speak
Russian, talk about the vagaries of being a
Russian immigrant, and discover more about
America from a Russian point of view. 
Jef and Lena demonstrate the value of gather-
ing various people together to acquire new
skills and build lasting relationships in a fun-
filled atmosphere. The meetings may or may not
generate direct sales leads, but they open
opportunities and build communities in which
both personal and professional opportunities
can flourish.

By networking, you never find yourself not working. Networking delivers more
leads and opportunities for productive relationships than you’re likely to
have the time and resources to pursue. 
Don’t get sucked into believing that everyone you meet is committed to
establishing mutually beneficial relationships. Opportunists may see you as a
way to further their cause without having any desire or ability to further your
cause. Watch out for these one-sided relationships. They can often drain your
resources and energy.
Identifying networking opportunities
I didn’t coin the 250 rule, but according to my field studies (at weddings and
anniversaries), I have confirmed it — every person on the planet knows at
least 250 other people. So I view every encounter I have with someone as a
networking opportunity — a chance to connect with 250 people. If you’re not
quite ready to network with everyone you meet, consider the focusing on
more formal networking opportunities:
 Meet people on the job. Get to know everyone you work with a little
better.
 Get involved in professional organizations. Connect with people in
your industry and with other salespeople. Join your trade association
and start making a difference. See “Joining and Leading Your Trade
Association,” as discussed later in this chapter.
 Join a community service organization. Rotary, Kiwanis, Toastmasters,
and other national organizations may have chapters in your area. These
are excellent places to meet the most ambitious and successful busi-
nesspeople while giving something back to your community. 
Don’t join an organization just for the sake of joining. Check out several
organizations until you find an organization whose mission you can pas-
sionately support and whose people you feel comfortable around.
 Join the local Chamber of Commerce. I’ve never found the local
Chamber of Commerce to be very effective in nurturing a business-
friendly environment. The real benefit of the Chamber of Commerce is
that it provides another meeting place for local business owners and
community leaders. 
When you join a club or organization, resist the temptation to sit with the
same friends. Mingle. Also, unless the organization prohibits the handing out
of business cards, don’t forget to hand your card to everyone you meet, as
discussed later in the section “Giving memorable tokens.”
220
Part IV: Prospecting for Sales Opportunities 

Soft-networking
In sales, you hear about the hard-sell and the soft-sell approach. You can net-
work the same way. Hard-networking is a more aggressive strategy, in which
you’re generally driven to connect with people who may be able to do some-
thing for you in the future — generate leads, find you a better job, and so
on. Soft-networking is more like socializing — you build relationships. Soft-
networking is less business and more pleasure.
Think of networking as socializing, and you’re likely to network more
effectively. 
Soft-networking builds relationships in which people are more comfortable
approaching you because they know you’re not just out to get something. To
establish relationships that make you more approachable, be aware of the
following do’s and don’ts of networking:
 Do belong. Become a part of the community and donate your time and
resources, so you’re not the guy who shows up at meetings just to pass
out his business card.
 Do show interest in others. Ask questions, contribute ideas, and offer
assistance. People are more inclined to approach you if they feel as
though you know something about them and their business and are con-
cerned about their welfare.
 Don’t ask favors. Build trust and a positive rapport first. You can ask for
favors and barter talents and resources more naturally as friends than
you can as acquaintances. Friends stay in touch even when they don’t
need anything, but when a need arises, the friend is there to help. Follow
the age-old advice of “Make friends before you need them.”
Take a break. Write down the names of five new people you want to reach
out to and five old friends you’d like to get back in touch with. Contact one
person from each list and see what happens.
Scouting for force multipliers
Who are you really? When you think about it, you’re more than just you. You
are the sum total of all of your relationships, past and present. The more rela-
tionships you have and the more productive each of those relationships is, the
more you accomplish and achieve. Continuing your personal and professional
growth process demands a constant pursuit of new talent and resources.
221
Chapter 14: Harnessing People Power with R-Commerce

Woodrow Wilson said, “I not only use all the brains that I have, but all that I
can borrow.” When you embrace R-Commerce principles, you tap the brain-
power and resources of others. You get more done by being with others than
you ever could accomplish by yourself.
When you’re networking, remain on the lookout for force multipliers — a term
the military uses to describe any factor that dramatically increases the effec-
tiveness of a military unit. This could be something high-tech, like satellite
imagery revealing the positions of enemy troops to something environmental,
such as having the sun at your back. In sales, a force multiplier can be a soft-
ware program, a lead generating service (such as Guthy-Renker Home, for
real estate agents), a drip e-mail campaign or any number of other tools that
enable you to sell more efficiently. A force multiplier can also be a person
with the attitude, intelligence, or other talents you need to take your career
to the next level. 
R-Commerce is about looking at a vast network of people whom you know
and filtering problems and opportunities through that group. Who is particu-
larly good at accounting? Who is particularly good at designing and building
Web sites? Who’s outstanding at motivating and communicating with team
members? Identify these key people, these force multipliers, and add them to
resource pool. When you have a great idea for making money, you can
quickly assemble your all-star team and get to work. 
Don’t forget the role you play in assembling R-Commerce communities to
work on projects. As the rainmaker — the person making this all happen —
you’re responsible for giving what you have to offer to these talented force
multipliers: 
 Trade value for value. Identify what the others on the team need most,
and deliver it. Compensation may be in the form of money and benefits,
new opportunities, increased status or credibility, assistance in a profes-
sional or personal matter, or something else you can offer. Remember that
all people must benefit in some way from this association. No one will
keep contributing to a task or project if they are not being compensated.
 Find the right fit. Align people with work that they’re qualified to do and
are going to find rewarding. Don’t try to force a square peg into a round
hole just to get something done. If someone isn’t perfect for this particu-
lar project, they may be perfect for the next project.
 Accommodate different personalities. You may find one or two areas
where you disagree, but don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater.
Embrace areas where you agree, and let the rest go. 
Just as some people can be force multipliers, others can be force dividers.
They can ruin the morale of an entire staff, ruin projects with their incompe-
tence, and destroy dreams, visions, and creativity. R-Commerce does not
work with negative people. I have had negative people in my life and tried to
change them. It didn’t work. 
222
Part IV: Prospecting for Sales Opportunities 

Gathering vital information
Whenever you meet someone new, whether you bump into them in person,
over the phone, or online, use your sales skills to ask questions and gather
the following information about the person:
 Career, work, or major in school
 Interests and hobbies
 Goals or dreams
 Special talents
 Contact information
Ask the person for a business card, and if she doesn’t have one available, jot
down the information in a notebook. You can enter the information into your
database, as described in the following section, later. If the person does pro-
vide you with a business card, jot down some additional notes to remind
yourself later of any details that aren’t included on the card. 
When I return to the office at the end of the day, I scan the card and then pass
along any additional details to my assistant who types the information into
my contact management program. I don’t want to loose any shred of valuable
information, so I try to tell the entire story of the person, including where and
how we met and everything that person told me.
Building a database
Unless you have a photographic memory with total recall, I suggest that you
start building a database of everyone you come in contact with . . . and I do
mean everyone. Over my 30 years in real estate, I’ve built a database of more
than 7,000 contacts, including real estate agents, mortgage brokers, loan offi-
cers, attorneys, Web site designers, corporate bloggers, marketing people,
writers, editors, and people in every field imaginable. When I have an idea for
a new project or need something done, I can immediately pull up my data-
base and gather together a team of talented individuals to tackle the project.
Moreover, if a customer mentions needing assistance in an area that’s outside
my circle of expertise, I can usually provide at least one, if not dozens, of
referrals.
I’d like to meet you. Take a moment and email me with your information at
ralphroberts@ralphroberts.com.
223
Chapter 14: Harnessing People Power with R-Commerce

Categorizing your contacts
When you’re gathering contacts and building your database, consider catego-
rizing those contacts in terms of how urgently you need their services or how
likely a customer is going to purchase your products or services. I generally
place contacts in one of the following three categories:
 Hot prospects: Those whose services I need most or who need my prod-
ucts or services most urgently. You can feel the excitement or electricity
as you discuss a future relationship. These are the prospects you should
pursue most ambitiously. Give them laser-beam attention.
 Warm welcomes: Those with whom you would feel comfortable working
or who are likely to need your products or services almost immediately
but aren’t exactly drooling over the prospect of working with you. These
are the people you pursue as time allows.
 Sooner or later: Those who haven’t quite showed up on the radar. You
can’t really see their talents or expertise serving you, and they really
don’t need what you have to offer, but you never know, so you add them
to your contact list just in case.
Don’t ever throw someone away. You never know when people can move
from the “Sooner or later” category to the “Hot prospects” category. Keep
them in the loop, using some automated technology, such as a newsletter 
or e-mail messages, but don’t invest a great deal of time or energy trying to
force a relationship.
Managing your list of contacts
I use Microsoft Outlook as my contact-management program. Some people
love ACT! Others use a spreadsheet or database program or simply type the
information into standard document, but these general-purpose programs
don’t offer the same power and flexibility as you get in a dedicated contact-
management program. Using Outlook, I can store names, addresses, phone
numbers, e-mail addresses, birthdays, anniversaries, and additional informa-
tion about each of my contacts. I can print mailing labels, set up Outlook to
notify me of meetings and important dates, and even transfer data to my PDA
(personal digital assistant) to take it on the road. For additional guidance on
how to get the most mileage out of Outlook, check out Outlook 2007 For
Dummies by Bill Dyszel.
Consider purchasing a business card scanner, such as CardScan or Worldcard
to simplify the process of entering information from business cards into your
contact management program. CardScan can read a business card; transfer
entries to the appropriate fields in your contact management program, PDA,
or smart phone; and save the data online, so you can pull it up on any com-
puter anywhere in the world that’s connected to the Internet.

Giving memorable tokens
You have a relationship when someone returns home or heads back to the
office thinking of you and when you return home or head back to the office
thinking of that other person. Making a great first impression is certainly the
most important step, as discussed in Chapter 4, but leaving the person with
some tangible memorabilia is a great way to seal that first impression in their
memories. 
Carry some “gifts” with you wherever you go, so you always have something
new to give to someone you already handed your card to. Here’s a list items
you may consider passing out:
 Your business card: A classy business card printed on high-quality card
stock with raised lettering is the gold standard for memorable business
tokens.
 Your brochure: Print up a professional brochure explaining who you
are, what you do, and what you sell. Remember, you’re not simply selling
a product. You’re selling yourself. Check out Chapter 9 for additional
details on how to sell yourself.
 An inspirational book: For less than ten bucks, you can purchase inspi-
rational books that can touch a person deeply and cause them to
remember you for the rest of their lives. I used to carry around several
copies of The Platinum Rule by Art Fettig (see the following sidebar,
“Living by the Platinum Rule”). If someone already had my business card
and brochure, I’d give them a copy of the book.
 A thank-you card: Nothing says “thank-you” better than a big, fat bonus
or tip, but a thank-you card runs a close second. Have thank-you cards
printed that include your contact information, and whenever someone
does something deserving of a thank-you, write a personal message on
the inside of the card and leave the card behind.
 Flowers or candy: For those deserving of a special thank-you, consider
leaving behind a box of chocolates or sending a bouquet of flowers.
Joining and leading your trade association
If you don’t already belong to your trade association, shame on you. You’re
missing one of the best R-Commerce opportunities on the planet. Your trade
association is your community, and if you’re not actively involved in that
community, you’re not tending to one of the four C’s of R-Commerce —
Community.
225
Chapter 14: Harnessing People Power with R-Commerce

If you’re already a member of your trade association, you deserve a pat on
the back for taking the initiative, but now I want you to work your way to a
leadership position. In every organization, the leaders have more stage pres-
ence, a higher profile. You don’t even have to introduce yourself to others in
the organization, because their goal is to introduce themselves to you.
Getting noticed in the community
Every businessperson, regardless of position, should be actively involved in
the community. Communities not only buy products, but they support busi-
nesses, supply talented personnel, and spread the word outside of the com-
munity. You should be even more involved in the community if you’re selling

Living by the Platinum Rule
When giving, don’t make the mistake of giving
to get. Give for the sheer privilege of giving. Pay
it forward. Art Fettig clearly points out the dis-
tinction between giving to get and giving to give
in his book The Platinum Rule, but the best way
to illustrate the rule is to look back at giving
experiences you’ve had.
Think back to the last time you gave or loaned
someone money or something else with the
understanding that someday that person would
return what you gave or repay you in some way
and never did. Chances are pretty good that
over time, your relationship with that person
became strained. You may have avoided the
person, because you didn’t know what to say
and felt uncomfortable bringing up the issue
and clearing the air. Unbeknownst to you, the
other person probably felt even worse than you
did. Instead of resolving the issue, the relation-
ship simply dissolved. What a tragedy! Giving
actually ruined the relationship.
To avoid the ugliness that often results from
giving and lending, Art recommends the
Platinum Rule — give without expectations. The
next time you give somebody something and
that person says he’ll pay you back, say, “Here’s
how you can repay me — never try to repay me.
Instead, help someone else someday.” The next
thing you tell him is, “Please don’t ever bring
this up again. Consider the matter closed. I’m
not going to say anything about it, and I don’t
want you telling anyone about it.”
Shortly after I read The Platinum Rule, I called
Art Fettig, and we struck up a conversation that
led to a friendship that has lasted all these
years. I started practicing the Platinum Rule,
and the more I did, the more confused I became.
I called Art and said, “I’m following your advice.
I’m telling people not to tell people what I did for
them, and they’re telling people all sorts of good
stuff about me anyway.” Art replied, “Of course,
that’s what happens with the Platinum Rule.
There’s nothing you can do about it. You can tell
people not to say anything to anyone, but
they’re going to do it anyway. They’re going to
say great things about you for the rest of your
life. And now they’re going to do something nice
for another person in need.”
Pay it forward. Start living by the Platinum Rule,
and make the world a better place.

products and services directly to people in the community — for example, if
you’re a real estate agent, car dealer, insurance salesperson, restaurant
owner, or retailer.
In the following sections, I guide you in identifying the communities in which
you’re a member and then offers some suggestions on how to become more
involved.
Identifying your communities
Instead of advising you to get involved in your community, I should really be
advising you to get involved in your communities, plural. Depending on how
you define “community,” you can be involved in several communities, includ-
ing your family, neighborhood, city, state, nation, professional organizations,
online communities (such as MySpace), and a host of others.
Jot down a list of all of the communities in which you live and sell. When you’re
done with that list, continue adding communities into which you believe you
can expand your R-Commerce activities. This may include churches, service
organizations, online communities (as discussed in Chapter 17), user groups,
political organizations, schools . . . the list goes on and on.
Volunteering your services
Showing up for meetings is only the first step to becoming involved in your
community. Take the next step — volunteer. Most organizations are in dire
need of your skills as a salesperson to promote the organization and raise
funds. When you volunteer, you join an elite group of community leaders,
who usually happen to be the business leaders in the community, as well.
Followers don’t volunteer for anything.
Don’t restrict yourself to volunteering for jobs you’re good at. Volunteer orga-
nizations are one of the best places to acquire a free education and plenty of
on-the-job training. Identify skills you want to acquire or improve, and see if
the organization has any positions that require those skills. Better yet, team
up with someone who has those skills and work as their assistant.
Don’t just be a check writer. Giving money is great, but your time and exper-
tise are even more valuable. Participate.
Giving free speeches and presentations
Service organizations often focus their meetings on specific topics and invite
accomplished professionals to speak at these meetings. They may even offer
you a token payment, but whether or not they pay, seize the opportunity to
speak at meetings or special events. Again, this raises your profile in the com-
munity and opens you to new opportunities.
227
Chapter 14: Harnessing People Power with R-Commerce

Speaking engagements also enable you to practice your public speaking
skills, and if those are a little rusty (or non-existent), consider joining
Toastmasters. Check out Chapter 9 for more about public speaking or buy
(and read) Public Speaking For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Malcolm Kushner.
Taking on a leadership role
Like businesses, organizations have hierarchies that start with “members”
and go all the way up to “president.” Don’t settle for being a member. As I dis-
cussed earlier in this chapter in the section “Joining and leading your trade
association,” the higher your position in an organization, the more visible
you are and the more opportunity you have to improve the organization.
When elections for officers roll around or the organization is appointing
people to sit on the board of directors, get your name on the ballot. If you
don’t feel comfortable gunning for the presidency, start slow with a position
as treasurer or secretary. The more comfortable you become in that position,
the more likely you are to feel qualified to take on a more responsible role.
Becoming the Go-To Guy or Gal
After you’ve built a solid R-Commerce network, it begins to take on a life of its
own and requires much less time and energy to maintain and grow. With your
overstuffed Rolodex and your generosity, you now become the “go to” guy or
gal, the communications hub that people come to whether they have a prob-
lem to solve or a brilliant idea to make tons of money. 
Sometimes, you can charge a finder’s fee or referral fee to put people in touch
with one another, but in most cases, paying forward is the best approach.
As the person who knows everyone, you suddenly become the person every-
one wants to know. People will seek you out when they need a good dentist,
doctor, attorney, building contractor, web designer, graphic artist, you name
it. And every time someone new comes to you with a question, you have the
answer or the next best thing — someone else who can answer the question. 
This provides you with the golden opportunity to give to two people; you
assist the person who needs assistance and business to one of your contacts.
You may not receive any monetary reward or compensation, nor should you
expect it, but you’ve just made a huge deposit into your R-Commerce bank.
Assuming the relationship you created is a positive one, both recipients of
your gift are likely think fondly of you well into the future.

Healthcare professionals recommend that you exercise 30 minutes a day.
Don’t forget to exercise your give muscle. Live in a world of abundance and
assist others in achieving their goals. By doing this, you create magnetism
around you and people just naturally want to be near that positive energy. I
know this can sound like a bunch of “woo woo stuff” and really “out there,”
but when you follow this approach, you really do generate a magnetic field
around yourself. 
Building R-Commerce with Your Clientele
Visit any comparison shopping site on the Internet, such as Froogle
(froogle.google.com) or Dealio (www.dealio.com), and you’re likely
to find the absolute lowest prices for products you can find anywhere, online
or off. Yet, most people continue to buy from major retailers. Why is that?
And why is someone willing to pay over $3 for a cup of coffee at a posh coffee
shop when they can grab a perfectly good cup of coffee at a fast-food restau-
rant for less than a buck?
The reason is that people don’t just buy products or services. They’re buying
relationships. They’re paying extra to feel special and to do business with
someone they trust.
R-commerce is all about enhancing the total experience your clients have
when they do business with you. When you’re selling to a customer and
doing it right, your customer feels a sense of partnership and security. Your
customer knows that you’re looking out for her best interest. In Chapter 18,
I offer specific suggestions on how to use R-Commerce strategies to focus on
your customer’s success and improve your own success as a result.

Prospecting for Untapped and
Under-Tapped Markets 
In This Chapter
 Identifying new markets for products and services
 Focusing on demographics
 Going global
 Bundling your goods and services
 Inventing other uses for your products
W
hen you run out of leads, it’s often tempting to think that you’ve run
out of market. You may discover additional opportunities, however, in
untapped and under-tapped markets — opportunities you may not yet have
considered. 
In their early days, for example, cellphones were primarily used for business.
They quickly made their way into the home markets, and now even kids are
packing cellphones. Why? Because clever marketing people were able to con-
vince families that a cellphone is an essential communications tool for every
single family member. When they discovered they were running out of road,
they made more road.
Whatever you happen to sell, you can usually find untapped or under-tapped
markets that could use your product but simply don’t know about it or
haven’t thought of using it in a particular way. In this chapter, I encourage
you to explore other markets and provide several clues on where to begin
looking for ideas.
Seeing Business Where It Isn’t
Sales opportunities don’t exactly slap you in the face. They’re extremely diffi-
cult to notice, because opportunities, by their very nature, are vacuums —
they’re invisible. You have to train your mind to look for the signs of a
vacuum and, even better, envision something filling that open space. You
have to train yourself to see business where it isn’t.

When I tell you to “See business where it isn’t,” what I mean is that you
should look for markets that you and your competitors are not serving. Say
you’re selling satellite phones, for example. Ask yourself, who could really
use a satellite phone that I’m not selling to? If you’re only selling to business
people who travel to areas where cellphone service is unavailable, you’re
missing out on other potentially lucrative markets, including the following:
 Foreign exchange students
 College students who may travel abroad
 Mountain climbers
 People who go on cruises
 Oceanographers
 Pilots
Some people can naturally think of a thousand and one ways to market a prod-
uct, but you don’t have to be born with a gift for it. You can train your mind to
look for business where it’s not and spot new opportunities. Here are some
suggestions that can open you to new sales and marketing opportunities:
 Look for trouble. As a salesperson, you’re selling solutions. Find a group
of people with a problem that your product or service can solve, and
you’ve discovered a new market. In my industry, the real estate business,
I’ve been able to build entire new divisions on problem areas, including
foreclosure, probate, and divorce.

The birth of FlippingFrenzy.com
For several years, I had been researching real
estate and mortgage fraud and could see that
they were big problems in the real estate indus-
try. Con artists, many of whom were industry
insiders, were fleecing the system and home-
owners out of billions of dollars. Illegal house
flipping and other forms real estate crime were
increasing foreclosure rates and destroying
neighborhoods.
Thousands of files crossed my desk and I was
fielding phone calls from victims on a daily
basis, but the media was clueless. I spend mil-
lions of dollars of my own but was still unable to
get anyone from the media or government
agencies to pay attention. I was ringing the
alarm bell, but nobody heard or took notice. I
could see the trend, but I really didn’t know
what to do about it. 
One evening, one of my real estate assistants,
Sarah Hodges, came into my office, and we dis-
covered blogs. The people who created these
intriguing new online community centers
seemed pretty excited about them, and visitors
apparently loved the interaction and lively
banter that these blogs seemed to generate.
Sarah and I were excited at the prospect of
engaging the public in this innovative forum.
Then, it hit me . . . a real estate and mortgage
fraud blog . . . FlippingFrenzy.com! We were off
to the races!

 Network extensively. People often want to talk about their problems in
the hopes that someone can solve them or simply to vent some frustra-
tion. In either case, networking enables you to hear more problems and
discover more opportunities for solving those problems. Networking can
also open you up to partnerships that may lead to other markets.
 Read extensively. Reading articles, especially articles that seem to have
nothing to do with what you’re selling, can often make your mind more
receptive to opportunities.
 Juxtapose two or more ideas. Sometimes, neither of two separate ideas
or technologies can open any doors for you, but when you combine the
two, something magical happens — sort of like combining chocolate and
peanut butter. The creation of one of my most popular Web sites hap-
pened that way, as I relate in the following sidebar — the birth of
FlippingFrenzy.com. 
You’ve probably seen clever new startup businesses and said to yourself,
“Now why didn’t I think of that?” The people who start these businesses see
business where it isn’t. Recently, I received a letter from a company informing
me that they were aware that my name was on title for a piece of real estate I
purchased about a year ago. It went on to say that many property owners
don’t have a certified copy of their deed and offered to get that for me. All I
had to do was mail the completed, signed form back to them with a check for
$69, and I would receive my paperwork with in four weeks. What a great idea!
You can go down to the county and get a copy of your deed for about $1
through the Freedom of Information Act, but someone realized that property
owners don’t even know that’s an option and would really like to have a piece
of paper showing that they officially own their property.
Become a lifetime learner to continuously open yourself to new ideas, mar-
kets, and opportunities. Just because the phone isn’t ringing off the hook
doesn’t mean you should go into lockdown mode. You should be doing just
the opposite — get out there and find out what’s happening. Seek out the
most recent trends and discover ways to tap into their momentum. Only by
becoming a lifelong learner is this possible. Fill your mind, keep it active, and
it will do the rest for you, intuitively making the connections that open the
doors to new opportunities.
Considering a Different Demographic
Are you serving all markets, regardless of race, ethnicity, beliefs, or lifestyle
choices? If you’re not, then you’re not tapping the full potential of your con-
sumer base. You may be completely unaware that your marketing materials
target a particular group of people at the expense of missing opportunities with
different groups. By catering to these under-served customers, you can often
win over a huge segment of the market that your competitors have neglected.
233
Chapter 15: Prospecting for Untapped and Under-Tapped Markets

To appeal to different demographics, you have two options — revise your
marketing to be all-inclusive or develop new marketing materials to target
specific groups that your other marketing materials seem to miss.
In the following sections, I provide additional insights and tips on who to
serve certain market segments that traditionally have been neglected — 
specific generations, people who are disabled, racial or ethnic groups that
may be under-serviced, and global markets.
Targeting a generation
Salespeople often focus on people who are part of the same generation they
are. Plastered all over their brochures, Web sites, and other marketing ma-
terials are people who look and dress just like them. After all, selling anything
is easier when you’re selling it to someone who have more in common with.
When you’re looking to boost sales, however, you may need to be a little
more accommodating in both your marketing and sales. The following sec-
tions offer some tips on how to bridge the generation gap.
Every generation has a set of common experiences, values, and way of doing
things that distinguish it from past and future generations. By remaining sen-
sitive to these differences, as discussed in the following sections, you can
market and sell more effectively to people from different generations:
 G.I. (“Greatest”) Generation: 1901–1924
 Silent (“Post War”) Generation: 1925–1945

On Wheels
What Randi Payton, future CEO of On Wheels,
Inc. had noticed about the automobile maga-
zines stuffing the shelves at the local news-
stands and grocery stores, would eventually
lead him to build a multi-million dollar business
of his own. Or perhaps it was what he had
noticed was missing. 
All of the magazines for automobile aficionados
at the time catered to Caucasians. Randi knew
full well that other ethnic groups loved their cars,
too. He decided to create a company to provide
multimedia information to Asian, Hispanic and
African-American automotive enthusiasts, and
he started rolling out three national magazines —
Latinos on Wheels, Asians on Wheels and
African Americans on Wheels. 
His magazines have a readership of over 1.3 mil-
lion people monthly, and the publications gen-
erate $2.5 million in advertising sales. 
Through his vision and insight, Payton stands as
a glowing example of how you, as an entrepre-
neurial salesperson, can begin to see business
where business isn’t and capitalize on it.

 Baby Boomers: 1946–1964
 Generation X (a.k.a. Baby Busters): 1965–1976
 Generation Y (a.k.a. Millenials or Echo Boomers): 1977–1994
G.I. Generation
The G.I. Generation experienced the two Great Wars — World War I and World
War II and managed to survive the Great Depression. People in this genera-
tion tend to be frugal, have a great respect for traditional values, and gener-
ally own their homes, which they don’t plan on selling any time soon.
When selling to the G.I. Generation, be prepared to focus on quality and
value. Most of your customers are likely to be living on fixed incomes and are
very focused on making their money last.
Silent Generation
The so-called Silent Generation was born and raised between two great peri-
ods of global upheaval — the two World Wars and the Vietnam Era, complete
with its Cold War. They may not have fought in the Great Wars, but they cer-
tainly suffered through them and, perhaps as a result, came to value family
and security above all else. Because of this, the Silent Generation has been
officially labeled the generation of the “withdrawn, cautious, unimaginative,
indifferent, unadventurous, and silent.”
When marketing and selling to people in the Silent Generation, keep the fol-
lowing information in mind:
 Risk assessment is likely to play a major role in the purchase decision.
 Work ethic is highly valued. Don’t be late, and be prepared to work hard
to gain your client’s respect.
 Treat your clients with respect, addressing them as Mr., Mrs., or Miss,
followed by their last names. These folks are likely to prefer being
treated more formally.
 Be prepared to talk about costs. This generation grew up during tough
times when food and other goods were rationed. They are generally very
conscious of price and value.
 Speak and act conservatively. 
 Focus on convenience, simplicity, ease of use, service, and support.
 Present your products and services with a “you earned it” message. Give
them permission to spend their money.
 Don’t waste their time.
 Face-to-face meetings are generally most productive.
235
Chapter 15: Prospecting for Untapped and Under-Tapped Markets

 Although people of this generation may be fairly affluent “retirees,” they
are living in a time when medical advances have greatly increased life
expectancies, and many worry about outliving their savings. Depending
on what you’re selling, this could be good or bad, but you should be
aware of it.
Don’t assume that the Silent Generation is technologically illiterate. Many
members of this generation are quite skilled on the computer and spend
hours on the Internet, even in some of the “hip” social areas, such as
MySpace. And whatever you do, don’t refer to them as “seniors.”
Baby Boomers
Baby boomers grew up during a time of unprecedented wealth and freedom
that happened to collide with the perceived hypocrisy of the world around
them. As a result, they collectively formed what’s often referred to as the Me
Generation, relying on the guidance of their own inner visions and resources
rather than what society was telling them. Baby boomers generally feel a
sense of entitlement — they deserve the “good life” and believe that they
have what it takes to ensure it.
When marketing and selling to baby boomers, take an approach that’s more
in line with their thinking and the way they perceive the world. Here are some
suggestions:
 Appeal to the boomers’ sense of independence and rebelliousness.
 Play up the convenience of products. Boomers are money rich and time
hungry. They crave anything that will save them time and effort.
 To boomers, the Internet is a tool, not an end in itself. Although some
boomers are geeks, most simply see technology as a necessity.
 Keep it simple. Provide boomers with enough information to make a
well-informed purchase decision without burying them in details.
Remember, they don’t have time for that.
 Don’t quote “company policy” as a reason you can’t do something your
customer requests. Boomers don’t trust organizations and think of rules
and policies as a way of controlling them. Flexibility is key.
 External image is important to boomers. Even if they try to play it down,
possessions, status, and appearances count. 
 Boomers tend to be less trusting than other generations, so communi-
cate honestly and openly and be prepared to answer questions. If the
boomer senses that you’re not genuine, you haven’t got a chance.
 Word-of-mouth referrals carry a great deal of weight with this group, both
in real and virtual communities, so network effectively. See Chapter 14 for
additional guidance on developing productive relationships.
236

Generation X
Generation X has been saddled with all of the problems caused by the G.I.
and Silent Generations that the baby boomers have failed to fix. In addition,
they’re facing a future of increased insecurity and decreased financial oppor-
tunities while having to deal with the media labeling them as slackers. In
defense of this generation, I have to say that they’re a very capable group,
particularly in regards to technology.
Xers have grown accustomed to a chronically unstable job market, protected
neither by the government nor the unions. As a result of this and increased
opportunities via the Internet, they’ve become much more entrepreneurial.
Some estimates claim that Xers start 70 percent of the new businesses in the
United States.
When marketing and selling to Generation Xers, keep the following informa-
tion in mind:
 Most Xers shop online or at least do some portion of their product
research online when making a purchase decision. Make sure you have a
strong presence online.
 Reassure Xers that they are making a savvy purchase or investment
decision. Xers tend to feel insecure about their decisions.
 Give Xers more control. They tend not to be team players and may
cringe from long-term commitments. Forcing them to sign a multi-year
commitment for service may scare them off.
 Offer time-saving solutions. Xers aren’t slackers, but they will seize any
opportunity to perform a task in less time with less effort, so they can go
back to having fun.
 Present information in snippets, avoiding any kind of lengthy discourse.
 Brutal honesty trumps any slick marketing and advertising. Xers
demand an honest, straightforward presentation that’s fun and unique
without being pretentious.
Generation Y
Although the members of Generation Y were born later, they’re a step ahead
of their Gen X parents and siblings in terms of technology and communica-
tions. When you’re marketing and selling to members of Generation Y, the
Internet and newer communications technologies are even more important: 
 Never underestimate a Yer’s reliance on technology for massive amounts
of information. 
 Yers are truly democratic. They don’t rely on traditional establishments
to tell them what’s safe to buy. They rely more on community, especially
online, virtual communities for referrals. 
237
Chapter 15: Prospecting for Untapped and Under-Tapped Markets

 Yers are open to all forms of communication, including face-to-face, cell-
phones, text messaging, and instant messaging. The more communica-
tions media you can handle, the better you are going to be able to
accommodate their needs.
 Maximize the use of multimedia marketing. Yers require a lot of sensory
stimulation to stay interested in whatever it is you’re selling. Whatever
you do, don’t bore them with a stodgy presentation.
Yers grew up downloading music, video, podcasts, and a host of other media
and information from the Internet for free. Be prepared to deliver quality,
dynamic content to win their business.
Selling to the disabled
A friend of mine was born without arms. Whenever I see him, I shake his
shoulder. He likes that. He tells me that most people turn away. They get
uncomfortable. They don’t know how to act, so they choose avoidance. That
hurts. After all, this guy is a human being. He wants the same thing everybody
else wants — respect, dignity, human interaction, some emotional attachment. 
When your competitors are busy avoiding the disabled, do yourself a favor
and embrace them. This under-served market demands some attention and
service, and you could be the one salesperson in your area that provides it
for them. In addition to increasing sales, you receive a much more valuable
benefit — the friendship of entire groups of people who have a very unique
perspective and something to offer that you can’t get anywhere else.
If you have a disability, you already know this, but for those who don’t have
the advantage of the insight that comes with the experience, I can tell you that
most people who have a disability don’t want to be treated any differently. You
may need to adapt in some way, however, so you can provide them with the
same level of enthusiasm and service you offer your other clients. At one time,
I had a teletype machine in my office to communicate with my clients who
couldn’t hear. I found that the hearing impaired were much easier to work
with than the listening impaired. You can’t change the situation they’re in, so
don’t try, and don’t pity them. Just adapt to their needs. Every time you do,
you open yourself to a new valuable relationships and a host of new opportu-
nities. When I meet a client who’s wheel-chair bound and can drive a modified
vehicle, I ride with them. It makes us both feel more comfortable.
Overcoming racial and ethnic barriers 
Some salespeople actually let their prejudices get in the way of making
money. Personally, I think that’s borderline insanity, but it does leave more
opportunities out there for the rest of us.

If you’re not prejudiced or you can at least overcome any prejudice feelings
you have, consider tapping into the multicultural marketplace. In Chapter 19,
my colleague, diversity expert Michael Soon Lee, and I size up your multicul-
tural expertise with a simple ten-question quiz and then lead you through the
basics of becoming more sensitive and accommodating to clients from other
cultures. 
Whenever I work with homeowners who hire me to list their home or coach
or consult with other real estate agents, sales people, or businesses around
the country, I always advise that the only color you should see when you’re
doing business is the color green. I’ve encountered homeowners who have
placed themselves in serious legal predicaments and have jeopardized the
sale of their home simply because they didn’t want to sell to “those kind of
people” as if they were any better.

Seeing only green
About ten years ago, I was working with a
minority couple to help them find a home — a
pair of young professionals, both of whom had
solid incomes. They were excellent, highly quali-
fied buyers, whom any seller should have felt
fortunate to find.
When one of my buyer’s agents took them for the
first showing of one particular house, the garage
door was locked, and the owner wouldn’t allow
them access to one of the bedrooms or the
basement. 
They looked at other houses, but just couldn’t
find anything that fit their needs as well has that
house they were blocked from touring com-
pletely. They wanted to see the rest of the
house. We scheduled a second showing. My
buyer’s agent, the couple, and the wife’s father
went to look at the house again. This time, the
seller wouldn’t even let them inside. The seller
told them, “You kind of people don’t want to be
in this neighborhood.”
Somewhat shaken, the couple sought legal
advice and soon learned that the seller had
broken several equal opportunity statutes. Under
the law, they were clearly entitled to relief or
damages for the way they had been treated. 
As soon as he learned what had happened, the
listing broker immediately released the seller
from the listing agreement. A real estate agent
can lose his license for assisting people whom
he knows have broken equal opportunity laws. 
The couple was getting ready to take the seller
to court and there was a good chance that the
seller would lose his house in the dispute. At
this point I intervened. I convinced the seller
that he had been wrong in the way he treated
the couple and he eventually settled the matter
with the couple out of court, paying them about
$10,000. Thanks to that money, which the couple
used as a down payment, they were now able
to afford their dream house instead of settling
for something in a lower price range. 
The take-home message here is that green
should be the only color you see when you’re
selling. If your goal is to maximize your profit,
what difference does it make who buys it? If
someone wants your product, offers you the right
price for it, and is intent on closing the transac-
tion, why on earth would you not grab that deal? 

Shifting your gender focus
Now that the 21st century has arrived, I find it difficult to believe that sexist
salesmen still exist, but they do. I meet them on a daily basis. They meet a
woman and instantly ask to deal with her husband, as if she were some
second-class citizen.
The fact is that in 60 percent of relationships, the woman is the decision
maker. Women literally hold the purse strings. In addition, women are natu-
rally gifted at networking, so if you upset a female client, she’s much more
likely to pass the word along to her 250+ network of other men and women
who make decisions and have purchasing power. Over the course of my 30
years in real estate, I have witnessed significant changes — more women are
heads of households, primary wage earners, and decision makers. More men
are stay-at-home dads.

Saga of the sexist salesman
I’ve met some sexist salesmen in my days, but
the guy who used to deliver firewood to my
house was perhaps one of the worst. As you
read this story, you soon discover why he “used
to” deliver firewood to my house.
Every year, I spend about $350 on firewood. The
guy who delivered it guaranteed that the wood
would be properly seasoned. (If it’s green, it
doesn’t burn right, coats the inside of the chim-
ney with creosote, which is highly combustible,
and fouls the air.) 
One season, we received some green wood. My
wife, Kathleen, called the company and talked
with the sales rep who came over to inspect the
wood. He told Kathleen that the wood was per-
fectly fine and that perhaps he should speak
with her husband. She replied that there was no
need to call her husband, because she’s the one
who deals with the wood, but he insisted.
To keep the peace with the firewood company
and Kathleen, I got involved and suggested that
I keep the green wood and they deliver some
seasoned wood, which I would also pay for. I
figured that the green wood could season while
I burned the wood that was already seasoned.
Well, they never delivered the seasoned wood.
I called the company about a dozen times, and
they never returned my calls. 
The company lost me as a client, but even
worse, they lost all of the referral business I
stood to send their way. Had they dealt with the
“little lady” in the first place, they could have
resolved the issue, kept me as a client, and had
hundreds of additional clients from my referrals.
Instead, they chose to fire me as a client.
In contrast, we had a non-sexist plumber by the
name of Bruce Hassick. We were having a few
plumbing issues in the house, so I called Bruce.
He said he would stop by and take a look. When
he did, he discovered that my two hot water
tanks had gone out. He said he would make sure
we had at least one of them up and running, and
then he could replace the other one. I asked
whether he needed me, and he quickly replied
that he would go over everything with Kathy — I
was busy enough, and she was just as capable.
I was happy, Bruce was happy, and most impor-
tantly, Kathleen was happy. That’s how you sell.

Treat all of your clients equally, with the same respect, regardless of race,
ethnicity, beliefs, or sex. Not only is this the right way to act, but it’s also the
best way to sell.
Going Global: Exploring
International Markets
Today’s global marketplace hasn’t quite flattened the world, but it has made
it much easier to sell in foreign lands. With the Internet and global shipping at
your fingertips, you can create a Web store from the convenience of your
living room and sell and ship products to customers in Canada, Mexico,
South America, Europe, Asia, and anywhere else. 
You may not even have to ship the products yourself. By hooking up with a
drop ship supplier such as Doba (www.doba.com), you can sell the products,
collect the money, and then have the supplier ship the products directly to
your customers. With the world population at over six billion people, many of
whom have Internet connections, just think of the potential boost in sales
you would see if you could connect with even one percent of that market!
Before reaching out to the global market, I suggest you do some research and
expand slowly:
 Research any laws that may govern the sale of your products in foreign
lands.
 Consider establishing a partnership with foreign companies who sell the
same or similar products or services.
 Address the language barrier. Although many people in other countries
speak English, you may need to hire someone who speaks the language
to be most effective. Fortunately, in the United States, you can usually
find someone who can fill the position.
If you’re interested in marketing and selling products online, Wiley offers a
small library that covers just about every aspect of Internet marketing and
sales, including Selling Online For Dummies by Leslie Heeter Lundquist, eBay
For Dummies by Marsha Collier, Blogging For Dummies by Brad Hill, and Buzz
Marketing with Blogs For Dummies by Susannah Gardner. I could go on. 
Exploring Other Sales Channels
Customers want what they want, when they want it, and how they want to
buy it — in a store, from a catalog, over the phone, online, at a shopping
241
Chapter 15: Prospecting for Untapped and Under-Tapped Markets

kiosk or even from a handheld device. The way customers prefer to pay for
their orders also varies. Some prefer to pay with cash or check, some buy
everything with a credit or debit card, and online shoppers may enjoy the
convenience of PayPal.
To appeal to the broadest selection of customers, accommodate a wider
selection of preferences. If you sell goods primarily through a traditional
brick-and-mortar storefront, consider expanding to online sales. If you’re sell-
ing online, you may be able to increase sales by opening a local store. Or, if
you’re already selling online and through a local store, think about advertis-
ing in a magazine and having readers phone in their orders.
This is an age in which customers want to customize and personalize every-
thing. Just look how popular ring tones have become. Just about everyone who
owns a cell phone has it set up to play a different ring tone. This says a lot
about customers — people like options. It’s like that Burger King commercial
that encourages you to “Have it your way.” By expanding your sales channels,
you deliver goods however your customers want to order and pay for them.
Looking for Bundling Opportunities
Clever bundling of products and services can often make your products and
services more appealing seem more valuable. In the real estate business, I
often encourage the home sellers I represent to “bundle” a home warranty
with the house. These warranties cost only a few hundred dollars, but to
buyers who are worried about having to replace a $5,000 furnace right after
they purchase the home, the warranty appears to be worth much more. It
makes the buyer feel much more comfortable about spending a hundred
thousands dollars or more for the house.
I don’t know what you sell, so I can’t point out bundling opportunities that
may be available to you, but I can provide some general guidance on how to
select among different bundling options. The first step is to decide on the
purpose of the bundle:
 To attract new customers: Bundling can often be used to attract new
customers by offering increased value or convenience, or (as in the case
of extended warranties) reducing the worry a customer has when
making a major purchase.
 To retain existing customers: If your customer-retention rate is slipping,
offering additional products and services at a reduced rate may boost
revenue while at the same time increasing retention rates.
242
Part IV: Prospecting for Sales Opportunities 

 To bring ex-customers back to the fold: Bundled products may be used
to encourage ex-customers to try the service again, particularly if you
have improved your products and services and prices have dropped
since the time they left.
 To introduce an unproven product to the market: Bundling new,
unproven products and services with highly successful ones is a
common strategy for gaining market share.
The purpose of the bundle should drive your choice of which products and
services to bundle and how to most effectively market the bundle. A bundle
designed to introduce new products to the market is obviously going to differ
from one that’s designed to attract or retain customers.
The next step in introducing an appealing bundle is to select the products
and services you want to bundle and then research the market to determine
which bundling opportunity is likely to be most successful. Your market
research should be designed to turn up information about the following:
 Identify the market segments you want to target.
 Analyze the needs of those market segments.
 Investigate product and service combinations that can best meet the
needs of the targeted market segments. This may include checking out
bundles that your competition is offering and determining how you can
improve the bundle.
 Investigate the buying habits of the targeted market segments, so you
have a clear idea of how to market and sell the bundle.
Bundling doesn’t mean giving away the store. You can bundle products and
services and charge even more than if the customer purchased everything
separately. The key is to put together a bundle that separates you from the
competition and convince your customer that your bundle has value that jus-
tifies or more than justifies the sticker price.
Partnering with Other Product 
or Service Providers
Bundling products doesn’t always require that you have all the products and
services available to piece together an attractive package. You may be able to
partner with other businesses and salespeople who sell complementary
offerings.
243
Chapter 15: Prospecting for Untapped and Under-Tapped Markets

A real estate broker, for example, could partner with a mortgage broker to
offer home buyers a one-stop solution to buying a home and securing the
financing to pay for it. They could even bring a title company on board to
handle the closing or partner with builders to sell newly built homes. 
Think of what you’re selling and what you can add without having to do any
more work. Make sure you’re not getting yourself into a conflict-of-interest
situation and that the partnership offers your clients a real value-add. 
Think creatively and remain on the lookout for partnership opportunities.
Whenever you notice that your customers tend to use certain goods and serv-
ices that you don’t offer, you have an opportunity to either add those prod-
ucts to your product line or team up with another business that offers those
products and services.
Discovering Another Use for 
Your Product or Service
Products and services often have more than one use. You just have to
become somewhat of a visionary to identify new uses. If this notion seems a
little vague to you at first, just think of how satellite technology applications
have expanded over the course of about 50 years:
 Telecommunications
 Satellite television
 Satellite imaging systems
 Broadband Internet
 GPS (Global Positioning System)
 Satellite radio
 Satellite telephones
Even in real estate, the product I’m selling can have different uses. Some
buyers use a house to live in, while investors may want a house to lease, and
someone else may want the same house as a vacation property. Sometimes
by shifting your focus and marketing a specific use for a product or service,
you can make it more appealing to the different markets.
When you’re in sales, keep in mind that you’re not only selling products and
services. To make sure you’re earning a profit that justifies the time and effort
you put into your work, think of yourself as selling time — your time. The
more efficiently you can sell, the more money you make per minute. As long as
you’re constantly improving your $/minute rate, you’re making progress.

Tapping the Power of the
Multimedia Marketplace 
In This Chapter
 Making headlines in the print media
 Establishing a presence on television and radio
 Erecting your own billboard on the Internet
 Marketing via mail and e-mail
A
dvertising is everywhere. You see it on TV and the Internet, hear it on
the radio, and read it in newspapers and magazines. It pops up in your
mailbox and your e-mail box. It lines the streets and drives past you painted
on trucks and cars. Sometimes it even talks to you when you walk past a spe-
cial display in your hardware or grocery store!
Why do these ads permeate our world? Because they work. And when they
work, the company producing the ads is successful in taking up mind-space —
etching the image of a person, product, service, or brand on your mind and
the minds of any others who’ve encountered the ad. 
As a salesperson, you want to consume as much mind-space as possible, and
the most effective way to do that is to create a media blitz that uses every
form of media available — television, radio, print, Internet, and anything else
you have at your disposal. Wherever people go, in the real world or the vir-
tual world, you want to be there, reinforcing your message.
In this chapter, I introduce the various types of media that offer the most
bang for your buck and suggest ways for creating the media buzz that drives
customers right to your door.

Marketing Yourself and 
Your Product in Print
Although more and more people rely on TV and the Internet to stay informed
and entertained, a good number of people still turn to newspapers and maga-
zines for their information. Establishing a presence in the print media enables
you to reach the offline readers of the world.
By “establishing a presence” in print media, I’m not just talking about pur-
chasing advertising space, although that’s certainly one option. I’m also talk-
ing about making yourself available to reporters and perhaps even submitting
your own articles. The following sections discuss all three of these options.
You’ve probably seen advertisements cleverly disguised as newspaper or
magazine articles, the headline announcing a “New Medical Breakthrough for
Weight Loss!” Look a little closer, and you see “Advertisement” printed across
the top of the article in small print. The theory that drives these ads and
print-based marketing is that people tend to believe what they read, unless
they have good reason not to.
Advertising in print publications
The most obvious way to establish a presence in newspapers and magazines
is to take out an ad. That’s certainly easy enough. You contact the newspaper
or magazine, tell them what you want the ad to say, and submit your pay-
ment. Most publications have layout people who can design the ad for you,
so you don’t have to mess with fonts, graphics, and other stuff you may find
challenging.
To get the biggest bang for your advertising dollar, consider your clientele:
 Target the publications that your customers read. Placing an advertise-
ment in the local newspaper may be a good idea if you’re selling cars,
but an ad for productivity software may be better placed in a business
journal or trade publication.
 Sell the benefits. Don’t simply list the features of whatever you’re sell-
ing. Analyze the needs of prospective customers, and then pitch the ad
to those needs.
 Focus on the headline. People generally skim print publications for inter-
esting headlines and then invest time reading more only if the headline
engages them. Make that headline snap, crackle, and pop off the page.
 Choose an effective color scheme and design. Flip through the publica-
tion you’re thinking of advertising in and select the ads that catch your
eye. Ask some colleagues to pick the ads they like best. Then, select
246
Part IV: Prospecting for Sales Opportunities 

some samples and cut them out to show the designer. If you have a good
eye for what works, feel free to provide input, perhaps even a rough
sketch of what you’re looking for; otherwise, trust someone else who
has a proven track record.
To write an eye-popping headline, get in character. Pretend you’re a prospec-
tive customer. What would grab your attention and speak to your needs?
Check out the following sidebar, “In Transition?” for an example.
Moonlighting as a journalist
Your sales career makes you an expert. You become somewhat of an expert
on the products and services you sell, and from talking with your customers,
you become an expert on the applications and benefits of those products and
services. To anyone who’s in the market or may someday be in the market for
your products and services, this knowledge and expertise are pure gold.
The best way to invest this gold is to spend it freely. Write articles for news-
papers, magazines, trade publications, journals, Web sites, blogs, and any
other “print” media where you can get those articles published and where
prospective customers are most likely to read them.
247
Chapter 16: Tapping the Power of the Multimedia Marketplace
In Transition? 
Ed Primeau, proprietor of Primeau Productions,
Inc., a video production company I use to pro-
duce my videos, tells the story of how he maxi-
mized the use of headlines in print media to find
tenants for a couple of his rental homes.
“Awhile back I had two rental homes without
tenants. My fiancé and I decided to advertise in
our community newspaper, and when we sat
down to write the ad copy, we did what people
normally do — we started describing all the
great features of the homes. We listed the lot
size, square footage, number of bedrooms and
baths, and so on. We jotted down the benefits,
as well — great school district, nearby shop-
ping, convenient access to the expressway, and
low taxes.
When we were done, we had a great list, but
nothing that really spoke to potential tenants.
That’s when my fiancé suggested the title, ‘In
Transition?’ It was brilliant! Instead of focusing
on the home, it focused on the situation that
people who may be inclined to rent a home
were likely to be in. 
We spent a total of $95 advertising in all of our
county community newspapers (12 in all, if I
remember correctly), and we received 12 calls
between 3pm and 9pm on the first day alone.
The homes rented immediately!”
The headline is like a big fishing net that
catches readers as they’re swimming through
life not really paying attention. When advertis-
ing in print, make sure your headline speaks to
prospective customers. If you’re sending out
e-mail ads, take the same approach when com-
posing the subject line.

This is the information age. Companies online and off are starving for original
content that draws traffic. Original, insightful articles that engage and enter-
tain people are a valuable commodity, and companies are more than willing
to publish great articles for free, so don’t pass up the opportunity. Following
are some suggestions to get the most distance out of the articles you publish:
 Offer valuable information and guidance. Offer information and guid-
ance that empowers your audience to do something faster, better, or for
less money. Articles should be able to pass the “Who cares?” test. 
 Focus on the title. People skim the headlines, so make sure your head-
line grabs their attention and pulls them into the article.
 Get to the point. You have even less time to capture a prospective cus-
tomer’s attention in print than you have over the phone or in person.
State your point in the first or second sentence.
 Target articles for specific publications. Read the publication to get a
feel for the audience, tone, and style, and write your articles accordingly.
Talk with the publisher to determine word-count limitations, and strictly
adhere to those limitations.
 Edit carefully. Write, rewrite, revise, edit, and have someone else read
through the article before submitting it. You want to make it as easy for
the publisher as possible to simply drop the article into the publication
without having to do anything to it. (Ask if the publication has any writ-
ing guidelines you can look at before your get started.)
 Make sure you can re-use the articles. Give the publisher of the article
first publishing rights, but make sure you retain the rights to the article,
so you can re-use it on your Web site or blog.
 Add your contact information. Insert a credit line at the end of every
article that contains your name, area of expertise, the company you
work for, your phone number and e-mail address, and your Web site
address. 
You don’t have to be a professional writer in order to get published, but you
may need to hire a writer. As a sales person you have valuable experiences
that you should be sharing. Don’t let an inability to write get in the way.
Avoid the temptation to turn an article into a full-blown advertisement. Take
the soft-sell approach. Address the topic, offer your readers knowledge and
wisdom, and follow up with your name and contact information. 
248

Writing and distributing 
your own press releases
Another way to generate some marketing buzz, particular amongst industry
insiders, is to write and distribute a press release announcing a major product
release, a new service, a change in management, or any other newsworthy
item. If you can’t think of anything newsworthy right now, spend your time
searching for press release services that can get the word out the next time
some newsworthy event occurs. 
In the following sections, I offer some tips on penning your press release and
then actually releasing it.
Penning your press release
When a newsworthy event occurs (or is about to occur), start writing. Announc-
ing something that happened a week ago doesn’t exactly qualify as news . . .
it’s more like a historical account. As you write, follow these guidelines for
composing your press release:
 Read some sample press releases first. Model your press release after
others that you find compelling. After attending a conference for real
estate professionals, I penned the release shown in Figure 16-1.
 Include contact information. You want the press calling or e-mailing
you or your assistant to set up interviews and perhaps appearances.
 Add an intriguing headline. Nobody is going to read your press release
if the heading sounds boring.
 Start the first paragraph with the city, state, and date. Location and
time set the stage for the rest of what you have to say.
 Limit your release to a single page. You have very little time to make
your point. Remember, your goal is to convince people who read the
release to call you. 300 to 750 words is best.
 Don’t advertise. A press release is an announcement worthy of the
news, not an advertisement for products or services.
 Edit carefully. Your press release is a reflection of you, so make sure it is
well-written and free of typos and grammatical errors.
 Avoid using exclamation points or all uppercase characters. To make
your press release appear objective, keep the emotion out of it.
 Obtain permissions for quoted material. If you want to quote someone
in a press release, obtain permission from the person or company you’re
quoting.

“Divide & Conquer: Creating Virtual Offices & Expanding Market Area”
Ralph Roberts Realty, llc creating virtual offices and opening branches in several Metro Detroit Areas
Warren, MI   April 26, 2007- Ralph Roberts Realty, llc, which has been serving the Metro 
Detroit area for almost 2 decades, from their 13 Mile and Schoenherr office, will be moving 
their main office and establishing several virtual offices in 4 suburban cities (for a total of 4 
offices).
“The time of specialization and virtual offices is here now.” Says Ralph R. Roberts, broker of 
Ralph Roberts Realty, llc. “With technology today, like internet faxing, cell phones, wireless 
internet, and PDAs, we can “divide and conquer,” and more efficiently service our market 
areas in Oakland County, Northern Macomb, and Wayne Counties. 
Additional branch locations will include Southfield, Warren, and Washington Township with 
the main headquarters moving to Clinton Township. Plans to open other branches in Detroit 
and other cities are in the works. “As the need arises, we will open branches in other cites as 
the market area expands,” says Roberts. 
“So many buyers and sellers nowadays, use the internet and phone to sell and purchase 
homes. We can email them purchase agreements, send them virtual tours, and communicate 
with them in other ways via the Internet. Marketing virtually through websites, blogging, and 
emails is becoming more the norm than the exception. The need for having a 28,000 square 
foot office is obsolete,” says Roberts, “Most agents work from home and from their cars, and 
the need for a permanent desk in an office has diminished. I have agents who work from 
Starbucks sometimes, because it’s close and Starbucks has broadband wi-fi,” says Jocelyn 
Santiago, Sales Manager for Ralph Roberts Realty. All agents for the company will be able to 
use any of the 4 locations to meet clients, make copies, etc. 
Ralph Roberts Realty, llc is the home of “The Big Nail,” the giant nail from the I-94 Uniroyal 
Tire that Roberts acquired in 2003. Ralph R. Roberts is the author of Flipping Houses for 
Dummies published by Wiley in 2007 and numerous other books on real estate, sales, and 
marketing.

Releasing your press release
After you’ve written and carefully edited your press release, you have to find
some way to get it into the media channels. Several companies offer such 
services, including PRWeb at www.prwebdirect.com, 24-7 Press release 
at www.24-7pressrelease.com, and RISMedia at www.rismedia.com. 
You can search the web for “press release distribution” or other related
words and phrases to find a hundred other such companies, or e-mail me at
RalphRoberts@RalphRoberts.com and I can recommend a few options. 
Another option is to add a publicist to your team. Your publicist can handle
the writing and distribution of the press release, so you won’t have to do it
yourself. Most publicists offer different levels of service, so you can usually
find a package that meets your budget needs.
Getting Some Free Publicity
The only thing better than writing your own articles is to have someone writ-
ing them for you or have TV and radio stations calling you for interviews.
Assuming you’re pretty good at handling the interview process, a few min-
utes of your time can lead to some valuable free publicity and really get the
marketing buzz in full swing.
Call your local TV and radio stations and send them a marketing packet that
includes your business card, a brief letter of introduction, brochures, and
other marketing materials. Explain who you are, what you do, and your areas
of expertise. Whenever a story crops up in the media about your industry,
reporters start combing the area for local experts, and that local expert they
interview should be you. While others are paying top dollar for advertising,
you could be getting advertising for free — the type of advertising that TiVo
users are less likely to fast-forward through.
Build relationships with news desks, reporters, and producers. Often, I read a
great story, see it on TV, or hear it on the radio and blog about it. I then send
a copy of my post and a link to it to the reporter who broke the story. After I
make the initial contact, I try to set up a meeting, typically over lunch. Nothing
works better than a face-to-face meeting to build a long-term relationship.
Don’t wait for the local news to dig up a story that requires an expert like
you. If you have an idea for a story, contact the stations and let them know.
They wrack their brains every day to come up with intriguing stories. By
delivering them a story, complete with a topic expert, you’ve just enabled
them to go home early while creating a golden media opportunity for your-
self. You may even want to consider creating your own newsworthy events —
perhaps spearheading a community-improvement project.
251
Chapter 16: Tapping the Power of the Multimedia Marketplace

When giving interviews, train yourself to talk in sound bytes. I often jot down
a list of bullet points I want to make and then I repeat those bullet points
during the interview. When I first purchased the Big Nail, which I talk about in
Chapter 9, one of the quotes I repeated over and over again to every reporter
was, “The nail is to Detroit what the Stanley Cup is to hockey.” The more you
repeat your quote, the more likely it is to get picked up and coined.
Advertising on Television
According to a study released by Nielsen Media Research in September of
2006, the average home now has more TV sets than people, and the average
person in the U.S. watches four hours and 35 minutes of TV per day. A single
commercial during a popular TV broadcast can give you the opportunity to
reach millions of potential customers. Even a relatively inexpensive commer-
cial on a local channel can expose you to thousands of people you may other-
wise fail to reach through other media.
In the following section, Ed Primeau and I cover the basics of producing a 
30-second television commercial and then choosing an advertising slot that
gives you the most exposure to the demographic you’re trying to reach.
Producing your commercial

Riding the wave of major media events
You don’t always need to be at the center of a
major media event in order to capitalize on it.
My good friend Ed Primeau of Primeau
Productions, Inc. tells the story of how he capi-
talized on the closing of Detroit’s Tiger Stadium:
“In 1998 when Detroit’s Tiger Stadium closed
down, Tiger Stadium, my local production com-
pany produced an audio CD entitled ‘Echoes of
Tiger Stadium.’ We partnered with a local AM
radio station WJR who put their logo on the CD
packaging. At the same time, we put out press
releases to all the newspapers and radio and
television stations in the state of Michigan. We
scored 43 interviews in ten days!
We didn’t exactly stage the event that drew
media attention. Instead, we took full advantage
of a city- and state-wide event that we knew
would appeal to a wide variety of people, many
of whom would be prospective customers.”
Read the papers, listen to the radio, and watch
the local news with an eye to discovering major
events that you can transform into major market-
ing opportunities for yourself and your company.

under Video Production Services for the names of some candidates. Call around,
ask about commercials the company produced, and set up an appointment with
the company that seems the best able to meet your needs. The company should
be able to provide you with excellent ideas and guidance on how to proceed.
Avoid using an advertising agency to produce your commercial. The ad
agency simply hires a crew, just as you can do yourself, but adds a markup
for the service and simply subcontracts with a video production company.
Look in the Yellow Pages or online or ask another business owner in your
community who already has a successful TV campaign who they used.
Your goal is to produce an engaging, informative, 30-second commercial.
Although some commercials run 60 seconds, a vast majority are 30 seconds,
because 30-second clips provide the station with more flexibility in fitting the
commercials in specific slots, and they cost less to produce and air.
Although the process for actually creating the 30-second ad varies depending
on the type of commercial and the production service, the process for pro-
ducing a commercial, typically requires the following steps:
1. Conceptualize the commercial, perhaps drawing it out on a story-
board showing how you envision it playing out. Obtain additional
input from the video production specialists.
2. Write a 30-second script. Consider using a voice-over — instead of
having a person in the video talking, the speaker talks in the background
as the video plays. This costs less and simplifies the revision process.
3. Record a scratch track before calling in the voice over talent to do
the real read. A scratch track is a practice recording that enables you to
fine-tune the script before calling in the real voice-over talent.
4. Get timings from your script so you know how much footage needs to
be shot of each scene. 
5. Schedule a day to shoot. Shoot the video footage required for the com-
mercial and then some. Always shoot more footage than you need. Editing
the video later is much easier and less expensive than calling the film
crew back for re-shoots.
6. Review all footage and take notes before you get into the edit session.
The crew that did the shoot can make you a DVD window dub of all the
footage. A window dub is a work copy of the video that includes time
code numbers, so you can jot down sections of the video you want to
cut or keep as you watch the video. 
7. Add the voice-over narration and any background music or sound
effects to evoke the emotion you want the viewer to feel while view-
ing the video. Omni Music at www.omnimusic.com offers one of the
best production music libraries around.
253
Chapter 16: Tapping the Power of the Multimedia Marketplace

8. With the assistance of the video production service or a separate edit
house, edit the footage and mix in the narration and music to obtain
the best 30-minute spot you can imagine. Better editing houses may
charge a higher hourly rate, but the total production cost may actually
be lower if the editor works more efficiently. 
At the end of the process, the production company or edit house supplies
you with a broadcast dub — a final version of the commercial which you can
send to the TV station, and a master edit, that contains all the footage, just in
case you want to change something later.
Contact your local college or high school to see if they have any students who
are skilled in video production and looking for some real world experience. I’ve
discovered a great deal of talent through the coop program at the local high
schools. Most recently, we discovered Jessica Ruddle, who is very talented
and has teamed up with me and Ed Primeau to produce my videos. We plan to
continue working with Jessica through her college years. When partnering
with students, look for ways to promote their interests and careers, as well.
Picking the right station and time slot
TV stations charge you every time they play your commercial, and they charge
you more for prime-time slots, but cost alone shouldn’t drive your decision of
which station to choose, when to air your commercial, or how often it plays.
What you’re looking for is the most bang for your advertising buck:
 Choose a station that your target customer is more likely to be watching.
 Choose a timeframe when you want your commercials to air. Is your
target customer more likely to be watching Monday through Friday
mornings, weekend afternoons, or evenings?
 Call the television station’s sales department and ask which times are
available and at what price. You may be able to look up advertising rates
online.
Don’t buy a time slot just because it’s affordable. Consider the demographic
you’re targeting — stay-at-home moms, seniors, working parents, or whoever
they may be. Pick time slots during which your targeted demographic is
likely to tune in. The television station should be able to offer some guidance.
Prepare in advance for the increased business that your television commer-
cial is likely to generate. Do you have enough phone lines to handle the
increase volume of phone calls? Do you have enough staff to follow up when
more customers start contacting you? 
254

Getting on the Radio
Radio advertising used to be an affordable way to get the word out about your
products and services, but that’s changed over recent years with the intro-
duction of satellite radio. Satellite (pay) radio has drawn listeners away from
standard (free) radio stations, and radio stations have been slow to adjust
the pricing of radio commercials to account for the loss of listeners. In short,
paying for a radio ad may not be the best use of your advertising dollars.
This doesn’t mean that you should avoid local radio stations altogether. You
can still garner a great deal of exposure by establishing relationships with
local radio stations and offering your expertise as a consultant on stories
relating to your industry and anything else you’re involved with.
Programming is key to a radio station’s success, which is evident in the grow-
ing popularity of talk radio. If you have a lot to say and plenty of connections,
consider pitching an idea for your own talk show and describing your plans
for retaining and growing their listening audience. Don’t give up. If one sta-
tion turns you down, pitch your idea to the next station on the list.
Radio stations need your expertise as much or more than you need their abil-
ity to reach listeners, so don’t be shy about approaching radio stations. A per-
ceptive station manager sees you as an opportunity to deliver three items of
value:
255
Chapter 16: Tapping the Power of the Multimedia Marketplace
Strategically airing your TV commercial
Here’s another entertaining educational story
from my good friend Ed Primeau:
“A few years ago, my production company 
produced a campaign for a local window
replacement company. We used 3D computer-
generated animation to create fun commercials —
something that would capture the interest of
kids. Sure, we knew that kids weren’t exactly
the decision-makers when it came down to pur-
chasing replacement windows, but we figured
the kids could get us to the decision-makers.
By talking with the window company, we learned
that the decision-makers for buying replace-
ment windows were usually women. We told the
salesperson at the TV station that we wanted
the ads to target women, primarily homeowners
with young children. The salesperson told us
that between the hours of 6 am and 9 am were
probably best, because their viewing audience
was made up of stay-at-home and working
moms who were getting ready for their day. 
We picked time slots between 6 am and 9 am.
When our commercials came on, the cartoon-
like window characters and custom music
grabbed the children’s attention and thus the
mom’s attention. The campaign did very well
and the window company’s business tripled that
first year.”

 Programming content: The station needs valuable content to fill its
daily programming schedule.
 Listeners: Assuming you make a pretty good radio personality and have
valuable information and insight for listeners, your contribution can
assist in retaining existing listeners and attracting new ones.
 Sponsors: If you establish a following, and the station can prove that
people are actually listening, the station’s salespeople can sell more
commercials for more money to other businesses in the community. 
Convince enough listeners and sponsors to tune into your show, and you may
be able work out a deal with the station for some free or discounted advertis-
ing. You may also be able to get some free advertising through your commu-
nity service efforts.
Marketing on the Internet
Even if you don’t take orders on the Internet, you should be selling on the
Internet. This always-on, on-demand global community and resource center
is packed with people looking for information, answers, and camaraderie, not
to mention great products and services. To have a shot at these potential
customers, you need to establish a presence on the Internet.
In the following sections, I describe a host of marketing opportunities that
the Internet offers, including Web sites and blogs, email, audio and video pod-
casting, and instant messaging. I encourage you to explore and then integrate
at least a few, if not all, of these technologies into your marketing program.
Cross-market your real and virtual worlds. Your stationery, business card,
brochures, and every other paper communication you provide your client
should have your Web site address, blog address, and e-mail address. Likewise,
your Web site, blog, and e-mail messages should contain your business
address, phone number, fax number, and other pertinent information.
Setting up your own Web site
The most obvious way to establish a presence on the Internet is to build your
own Web site, where people can visit 24/7 to find out more about you and
your products, have their questions answered, and perhaps even purchase
products and services. 
Other experts are more qualified to lead you through the step-by-step
process of setting up your own Web site, including David A. Crowder, author
256
Part IV: Prospecting for Sales Opportunities 

of Building a Web site For Dummies. I can, however, provide some tips that
can assist you in making your Web site a better vehicle for marketing yourself
and your products:
 Obtain your own unique domain name. If you work for a company that
has its own Web site, creating your own area on that Web site is fine, but
it’s no replacement for having your own Web site with your own, unique
domain name (address, like www.ralphroberts.com). By having your
own domain name, you can build a following that travels with you if you
choose to change companies. To check if a domain name has already been
spoken for, visit www.internic.net/whois.html. Several companies
offer domain name registration services. Simply use your favorite search
tool to search for “domain name registration” or visit www.internic.
net/regist.html for a list of accredited domain name registrars.
Compare prices and services carefully before placing your order. 
If the domain name that matches your name is available, purchase that
domain. Also, secure the domain names that match the names of your
children. As the Internet grows, more and more domain names will be
taken, so secure them now.
 Invest in an attractive design. If you have a good eye for designs and
colors and can handle the technical side of creating Web pages, feel free
to do it yourself. Otherwise, hire a qualified designer.
You can find a good collection of Web site design and hosting companies
on the Internet that provide you with powerful tools and templates that
can simplify the process. You may even be able to purchase your
domain name through these sites. Look for Web site design and hosting
companies that specialize in creating Web sites for salespeople in your
industry.
 Offer valuable content. Prospective customers may visit your Web site
for the first time out of curiosity, but unless you offer something of
value, such as information, advice, entertainment, discounts, quality
customer service, they won’t come back.
 Make it interactive. Offer more than an online catalog of products.
Feature articles, brochures, a Q&A area, and other features that visitors
can explore. On a real estate site, for example, you may provide links
that enable visitors to find out more about local schools, property taxes,
area parks, and more.
 Keep it up-to-date. Visitors want a dynamic site with up-to-date content.
If you’re having trouble coming up with enough fresh content, consider
asking for contributions from other experts in the field. You may be able
to cross-promote one another’s Web sites.
If possible and beneficial for your customer, consider implementing a tool
that enables visitors to obtain personalized content. Guthy-Renker Home has
a tool for home buyers that enables them to enter the zip code for the area in
257
Chapter 16: Tapping the Power of the Multimedia Marketplace

which they want to live. The Web site then displays a custom page with
details about area schools, shopping centers, parks, and other amenities.
Launching and maintaining a blog
A web log or blog, for short, is a shared online journal, often a collaborative
effort in which visitors can comment on articles and other entries. Why
should you care? For several reasons:
 Blogs are hot. People who avoid commercialized Web sites gravitate to
blogs because they tend to be more personal and offer timely information.
 Blogs are communities that drive R-Commerce. Becoming established
as a knowledgeable and trusted expert in the blogging community
enables you to build strong relationships that sell product. For more
about R-Commerce, check out Chapter 14.
 Blogs are easier than standard Web sites to maintain. Keeping your
blog up to date requires no knowledge of HTML (hypertext markup 
language) — the tags used to format content on Web pages. You simply
type a message in a form, click a button, and your message appears on
your blog.
 Blogs are a great way to drive traffic to your Web site. A blog offers a
more approachable, less commercial venue that draws visitors. You can
then steer those visitors toward a more commercial Web site where they
can find additional information about products and services and per-
haps even place an order.
The investment required to launch and maintain a blog is minimal. You can
set up your blog and have it up and running in about 15 minutes. Several
sites, including www.BlogSpot.com, enable you to create your own blog for
free, although I highly recommend that your blog have a unique domain name
(address), as mentioned in the previous section on Web sites. If you’re look-
ing for a full-featured blogging and blog hosting service, e-mail me at
RalphRoberts@RalphRoberts.com, and I will recommend one. Some of
these services change so often and so drastically that I would hate to place
my recommendation in the book and have it change three weeks from the
time the book goes to press.
Be sure to offer your visitors something of value. To promote Flipping Houses
For Dummies, I hired a company called Grip Media (www.gripmedia.net) 
to build a combination Web site and blog called GetFlipping.com at www.
getflipping.com. From this site, visitors can view a flipping tip of the day,
view a sample chapter from the book, sign up for a 31-day e-mail course on
flipping houses, and much more. Of course, the site also provides a convenient
258
Part IV: Prospecting for Sales Opportunities 

link users can click to order the book. I currently have over 200 Web sites and
blogs, creating what I like to refer to as my own spider web.
For more about using your blog to market your products and services, check
out Buzz Marketing with Blogs For Dummies by Susannah Gardner.
Driving traffic to your Web site and blog
Erecting a Web site or blog on the Internet is no guarantee that people are
going to start flocking to it. You have to drive traffic to your site using any
and all means possible, including the following:
 Increasing hits with SEO (search engine optimization): Pack your Web
page with key words and phrases that people commonly search for on
the Internet when they’re looking for content that your Web site or blog
offers. Using HTML tags, such as <em> for emphasis, to call attention 
to key words and phrases. For additional tips and strategies for giving
your Web pages and blogs a higher profile, check out Search Engine
Optimization For Dummies by Peter Kent.
 Trading links with partners: If you know other people and companies
who write on the same topics as you do, consider trading links. You 
can post a link on your site pointing to theirs and they can return the
favor.
 Contributing content to other sites: Check out the Web sites and blogs
of others who write on the same topics that you cover and contribute
content to their site, if that’s permissible. You may also be able to
include a link to your site or your contact information if the person
allows it.
 Buying ads on search engines: Google has a feature called AdWords. For
a price, you can have a link for your Web site or blog pop up whenever
someone searches for one of your AdWords. Visit adwords.google.com
for more information. Other search sites may have similar features.
Adding audio and video content
The Internet, particularly the Web, is the perfect venue for multimedia pre-
sentations that include text, graphics, animation, audio, and video. When
designing your site and lining up content to offer visitors, don’t overlook the
audio-visuals. Stimulate the senses . . . as many as possible, to reinforce your
message through all available media.
259
Chapter 16: Tapping the Power of the Multimedia Marketplace

You can even offer downloadable audio or video podcasts that prospective
customers can play on their computers or transfer to their iPods or other
portable players to carry with them:
 Podcast: A podcast is an audio file that Internet users can download and
play on their computers or transfer to a portable music player such as
an iPod. You no longer need to hire a production company to create
books on tape. With a computer, microphone, and recording software,
you can record your own audio files and post them to your Web site or
blog. For details on creating podcasts, check out Podcasting For Dummies
by Tee Morris, Evo Terra, Dawn Miceli, and Drew Domkus.
 Video podcast: A video podcast (vidcast or vodcast for short) is a video
recording that Internet users can download and play on their computers
or transfer to a portable video player such as a video iPod. With a digital
camera, a tripod, and video editing software, you can create your own
video Podcasts to feature products, distribute how-to videos, or simply
deliver your message in a more personal format. For more about using
video on your web site and blog, check out Videoblogging For Dummies
by Stephanie Cottrell Bryant.
When recording for a video podcast, think about the screen size for a minute.
Unlike a television set, which has a lot of viewing real estate, portable video
devices have small screens and limited storage capabilities. Limit the size
and resolution of your video clip to accommodate these portable devices.
Connecting with customers via e-mail
Nobody likes receiving useless, unsolicited email messages, especially from
salespeople, but if you offer your customers and prospective customers
something they value, they’re going to be happy to opt in to whatever e-mail
marketing campaign your running. 
Don’t send unsolicited commercial e-mail messages (spam). Even if it’s legal
in your state, most people find it annoying, and it makes you look bad. Use an
opt-in system in which customers request to be added to your mailing list. In
addition to being the courteous way to handle mass mailings, this challenges
you to offer something of value in your messages.
To make your e-mail messages most effective as a marketing tool, follow these
guidelines:
 Use a catchy, descriptive Subject line. An email Subject line is like a
newspaper headline. It should catch the recipient’s attention and con-
vince her to read the message.
260
Part IV: Prospecting for Sales Opportunities 

 Keep your message short. Write your message, cut it in half, and cut it
in half again, and you should have the right number of words. When
reading e-mail, customers aren’t exactly patient.
 Edit carefully. If your e-mail program doesn’t check grammar and spelling,
compose the message in your word processing program first and then
copy it to your email program. Check every message yourself for typos
and grammatical errors; if editing isn’t your forte, have some who’s more
qualified review the message.
 Don’t sell. Your goal is to encourage your customer to contact you or visit
your Web site for more information. Announce new products, services,
or promotions; offer business tips; relate case studies of customers (with
their permission, of course); but don’t sell.
 Include your contact information. Every e-mail message should contain
a host of ways the recipient can contact your or obtain more informa-
tion. Everyone is different. Some people prefer calling, some prefer
e-mailing, and others would rather grab the information off your Web
site. Accommodate all preferences.
 Automate distribution. E-mail programs have features that enable you
to send thousands of messages with a single click of the mouse button.
Explore your email program to discover its advanced features for com-
posing and sending messages.
 Add a signature file. All e-mail programs include a feature that enables
you to create a signature file that the program adds to all outgoing mes-
sages. Create a signature file that contains your name, contact information
and Web site and blog addresses. This enables people to contact you for
more information, and it gives you a way to drive more traffic to your
Web site and blog.
261
Chapter 16: Tapping the Power of the Multimedia Marketplace
Drip, drip, drip e-mail marketing
When you’re selling to customers who often
take several months before deciding to pur-
chase a product or service, a drip campaign
can be the most effective tool for wooing a cus-
tomer. A drip campaign is a system in which you
send a prospective customer some form of
communication on a regular basis, so the cus-
tomer doesn’t forget about you and defect to
some other salesperson.
Whenever a prospective customer contacts you
for information, request the customer’s e-mail
address and ask the customer for permission to
send them email notifications of products, serv-
ices, and additional information. If the customer
gives you permission, add the person’s e-mail
address to your mailing list, so they receive regu-
lar correspondence from you. When they’re ready
to buy, you want to be the first person they call.

Make it easy for customers to opt out. At the end of every e-mail message,
provide instructions that enable your customers to remove themselves from
your e-mailing list. You always want to make your customers feel in control of
the situation. 
Keeping customers posted 
with a newsletter
Losing contact with a customer for more than a month is one of the best
ways to lose a customer, but you don’t want to sound like a nag. One way to
walk the fine line of keeping in touch with your customers without annoying
them is to publish a monthly newsletter via email.
In the following sections, I provide guidance and tips on designing your
newsletter, finessing the content, encouraging customers to subscribe (with-
out sounding too pushy), and automating distribution to save time.
Designing an attractive newsletter
You want your first newsletter to be the best, because you may not have a
second chance to make a good first impression. In any publication, your first
impression hinges on the design:
 Keep it simple. Include your company name and logo at the top, stick
with a single-column format (two columns at the most), and use graph-
ics sparingly and tastefully.
 Optimize your brand presence. Make the design consistent with the
look of your business cards, stationery, brochures, and other marketing
materials. See Chapter 9 for more about branding.
 Keep it short. Shoot for one page max; cover one to three topics per
newsletter, 200 to 500 words per article; give each article a descriptive
heading; opt for lists over text-heavy paragraphs.
Editing your newsletter
The professionalism demonstrated by your newsletter reinforces your own
professionalism, so make sure your newsletter is well written and error-free:
 Make it interesting. Every article should be able to pass the “So what?”
test. If you read the article and find yourself saying, “So what?” cut it.
Avoid bragging about your own or your company’s accomplishments —
save that for your family Christmas letter. Following are some ideas of
what to include:
• Tips and tricks for doing something better or faster or for enjoying
a particular product even more than they already do
262
Part IV: Prospecting for Sales Opportunities 

• S.olutions to common problems
• Answers to frequently asked questions
• Announcements of new products or services
• Special promotions or deals
• A dash of humor
 Punch up the style. Grab the customer’s attention in the first line of
each article and keep them moving along with short, simple sentences.
 Pick the most precise and powerful words. Start each sentence with a
strong noun and follow with a strong verb. Avoid starting a sentence
with “There are . . .” or “It is . . .”.
 Remove the errors. Check your spelling, grammar, and punctuation, and
then have someone else do a read-through. If your newsletter is riddled
with errors, your customers may wonder whether you can get their
accounts right.
Advertising your newsletter
After overcoming the challenge of producing a killer newsletter, you should
be highly motivated to get it into the hands of your customers and future
prospects. Advertise your newsletter everywhere your customer is likely to
come in contact with you, including:
 The opening page on your Web site or blog
 E-mail correspondence
 Brochures
 Letters
Distributing your newsletter
Although you can certainly distribute your newsletter as an e-mail attach-
ment, perhaps as a PDF file, I recommend you publish it in a separate section
on your Web site, instead. You can then e-mail your customers a link to the
newsletter. Better yet, send an e-mail with a summary of each article linking
back to the newsletter.
Why publish your newsletter to your Web site instead of sending the full ver-
sion to customers? I can think of several reasons, including:
 Some customers may choose to view text-only messages, in which case
all graphics are going to be stripped out.
 The e-mail reader may have a limited amount of space for displaying
your newsletter.
 If the newsletter is a fairly large file, and your customer has a slow Internet
connection, your customer may find the download time annoying.
263
Chapter 16: Tapping the Power of the Multimedia Marketplace

Plan on publishing your newsletter once a month. Customers are likely to
forget about you if they don’t hear from you in a month. Some salespeople
publish a short weekly newsletter and then follow up with something more
lengthy each month, but don’t overdo it. Quality trumps quantity. 
Re-use information. You can use the same information to create a press
release, post an article on your Web site or blog, and submit the article to
your local newspaper.
Staying in touch via instant messaging
Instant messaging programs, including America Online Instant Messenger
(AIM), Yahoo! Messenger, and ICQ are the communication tools of choice for
those who spend a good part of their day on the Internet. With an instant
messaging program, you can type and send messages back and forth between
two computers in real time and, with the addition of a camera and micro-
phone, videoconference with clients.
I’m away from my computer too much to implement this very effective tool in
marketing and customer service, but if you spend most of your day in front of
your computer and on the Internet and your customers use instant messag-
ing programs as their preferred method of communication, I highly recom-
mend that you do the same.
Launching a Direct-Mail Campaign
Although many proponents of email marketing want to proclaim the death of
direct mail campaigns (through the postal service), direct mail campaigns
can still be highly successful. 
This isn’t something I would recommend that you do on your own. Hire a
company that specializes in managing direct mail campaigns. These special-
ists offer the following benefits:
 Highly targeted mailing lists based on market research.
 Editorial services to enable you to compose a timely and relevant message.
 Design services to make your direct mail package look professional.
 Integration with other components of your marketing program.
Avoid the temptation of offering discounts or reduced rates to prospective
customers. You don’t always have to give away something to get the phone to
ring, and discounts often make customers think that your products and serv-
ices are overpriced to begin with. Instead, consider offering package deals
that create the impression of offering value without a discount.

Virtual World: Social Media

 Mixing it up in social networking communities
T
raditional media isn’t what it used to be, pretty much because there’s so
darned much media nowadays. Not so long ago, consumers had a very
limited selection — they could get relatively good reception on maybe ten TV
channels if they were lucky, tune into the radio, read the local newspaper and
national magazines, and take in a movie at the local theater.
Now, people have an infinite selection of channel-surfing opportunities —
hundreds of TV and cable channels, radio stations, satellite radio stations,
newspapers, magazines, movies (at theaters, on DVDs, and through pay per
view), Web sites, blogs, instant messaging, social networking sites like
MySpace, virtual worlds like Second Life. In addition, everything it offers is
free (or at least affordable), available 24/7, interactive, and on-demand.
This is good news and bad news for people in marketing and sales. The good
news is that you have a host of new opportunities to market products. The
bad news is that you have a host of new opportunities to market products —
you can’t just advertise on prime time TV anymore and think that you’re
reaching a majority of your target consumers.
Various factors, the biggest of which is perhaps the Internet, are fragmenting
the delivery of media, marketing, and communication. Traditional media chan-
nels are not engaging consumers and prospects as they once did. Increasingly,
consumers are tuning out traditional messages and turning in to new commu-
nication channels to fill the void. 

As a salesperson, you need to connect with clients and prospects in a whole
new way to get your message across to them. Social media (or the so-called
new media) and online networking tools are the newest and most effective
communication media, and in this chapter, my blogging colleague, Richard
Nacht, founder and CEO of Blogging Systems Group, and I show you how to
harness their power and start rubbing elbows in the vast online network of
social media and networking.
Grasping the Concept of Social Media
Every day, millions of Internet users commune on sites like YouTube (to
share video), Second Life (to work and play in virtual reality, and now to
market), MySpace (to network with friends, family, and colleagues), Digg 
(to share news), and Flickr (to swap photos) to name only a few of the more
popular online destinations. 
With more and more prospective customers spending more and more time
online, the most successful salespeople are setting up shop online to reach
prospects where their prospects and clients hang out. They are replacing
their traditional marketing toolkits with 21st century marketing tools, as
shown in Table 17-1.

Part IV: Prospecting for Sales Opportunities 

In a way, like most Internet features, social media just happened. Early in the
development of the Internet, Web sites were fairly static. People visited them,
but they didn’t quite interact with the sites. The Web was pretty much an
information kiosk. If you wanted to interact with people, you did it through
discussion forums or online chat.
I’m not sure who invented blogging. I’m pretty sure it wasn’t Al Gore. Whoever
invented it or started doing it first, however, must have though it would be
pretty cool to combine the simplicity of the Web with the social networking
aspect of discussion forums. That’s basically what a blog is — a more attrac-
tive, robust discussion forum. Other social networking sites, like Second Life
and YouTube are merely variations on the theme.
Applying social media to marketing 
and advertising
How do you define the word, “advertising?” In the old days, advertising could
be characterized as “repeated messages which emphasized a product’s or
service’s desirable qualities in such a way that captured the consumer’s
attention and aroused within them the desire to buy.” The goal was mass
appeal — targeting the biggest potential markets.
Those days are over. Mass is out. Niche is in. The consumer has become the
real advertiser. In social media, you build a partnership with your consumer.
You build a relationship in which your client is so excited about you and your
product that she spreads the word for you, calling attention to your products
and services. Your online content strategy can achieve what’s known as a
franchise in the mind — a collective, community consciousness that ripples
around the world through the underlying currents of the Internet.
One of the most powerful aspects of social media marketing is that it’s so
affordable. Initially, you may have a substantial investment of time and
money creating a low-level buzz, but once the buzz starts, it catches on like a
wildfire with very little effort on your part. You start the buzz, and your
clients convert that buzz into brand presence or a franchise in their minds.
Putting the “social” in marketing media
While traditional marketing and advertising centers around product and serv-
ice, social media marketing gathers its energy from personality, values, and
community — R-Commerce, as discussed in Chapter 14.

Chapter 17: Exploring Opportunities in the Virtual World: Social Media

Most salespeople try to build a brand on a single feature or benefit, such as
experience, knowledge, education, or service. But creating a strong emo-
tional appeal by focusing on features and benefits is nearly impossible. The
best branding campaigns are built on a personality, philosophy, or set of
values. These qualities are inherently emotional and, when used consistently,
give you a huge competitive advantage in the marketplace over time.

What they are saying about social media
Many old-school salespeople and marketing
mavens I talk to about social media are initially
reticent to jump on the social media and net-
working bandwagon. They think social media is
just for teenagers who have nothing better to do
with their time than hang out on the Internet.
Industry insiders across the board, however,
envision the true potential marketing power.
People of all ages are flocking to the Internet for
their entertainment, educational, and social
needs. It has become clearly evident that indus-
tries who successfully make the transition are
going to thrive, while those who don’t are likely
to fizzle.
According to Peter Daboll, president and CEO of
comScore Media Metrix, “The popularity of
social networking is not expected to wane in the
near future. This is a phenomenon we’re seeing
not only in the U.S., but also around the world.” 
Contrary to what many business people think,
social networking is not just for personal use.
Here’s a quote from a Business Week cover
story from as far back as June 5, 2005 address-
ing Web 2.0 tools such as blogs and wikis:
“These services haven’t had much to offer the
vast world of business — until now . . . Web 2.0
portends a real sea change on the Internet . . . .
For all its appeal to the young and the wired,
Web 2.0 may end up making its greatest impact
in business.” 
Edelman Research reports that consumers are
now less brand-loyal, less trusting of traditional
media messaging and more independent. Social
media and networking provide a solution to
these challenges in a spontaneous, real time
and participatory manner. Consumer-generated
content created via an online community in
which you are participating is going to provide
buzz and insight to companies. 
Fortunately, it’s not too late for any company to
take advantage of social networking. According
to a recent iProspect study:
“Though sites such as YouTube and MySpace
were designed to appeal to a high percent-
age of the online user population, many
social search engines have been built to
serve and attract, a community that is defined
by their affinity to a vertical industry, a busi-
ness model, or an interactive activity type.”
It’s still early in the history of social net-
working, yet one out of three Internet users
is already taking advantage of a site con-
taining user-generated content to help
make a decision to buy, or not buy some-
thing. This bodes well for the future of these
sites that take advantage of our human
nature to trust the recommendations (and
warnings) of fellow consumers more than
we do the claims and ‘marketing-speak’ of
professional marketers.”

Social media puts the social and emotional back into marketing. It enables
you to establish a strong positive rapport with your community of clients and
prospects, and, over time, build the trust that makes clients comfortable
buying whatever you have to sell.
For 21st century salespeople looking to engage hundreds or thousands of
prospects and customers, social media provides a powerful solution for cre-
ating, organizing, managing, and distributing your content online. 
Assessing the pros and cons of 
social media and networking
Putting yourself and your company out there on the Internet can be a little
scary at first. After all, the Internet is the consummate democracy . . . total
freedom, almost to the point of anarchy. Say the wrong thing at the wrong
time, and somebody is likely to pick it up and use it against you. Hordes of
prospects and clients may inundate your site with questions, complaints, and
outright attacks. This thing can potentially do more harm than good.
This is all true, but I believe that the potential benefits far outweigh the
potential drawbacks. In the following sections, I reveal the potential benefits
and drawbacks, so you can decide for yourself, and then point out some
options that may set your mind at ease.
I feel a little silly including a discussion of the benefits of blogging, as though
I have to convince you of its value. The overriding reason that every sales-
person should be blogging is that prospects and clients want it. If you don’t
do it and your competition does, you’ve already conceded a good slice of the
pie to your competitors. Unfortunately, the IRS won’t let you write it off as a
loss on your taxes.
Considering the benefits of social media and networking
If you need some convincing about the value of blogging and other social
media and networking tools for marketing purposes, I could probably deliver
an hour-long presentation, complete with graphics, and still have plenty
more to say. I’ll spare you that experience and simply list ten key areas where
social media and networking can benefit your marketing efforts:
 Search engine marketing: Blogs give you an increased presence on
major search engines like Google and Yahoo. Some search engines pick
up new blog content in as little as five minutes! One veteran blogger put
it this way, “BLOG stands for Better Listings On Google.” 
269
Chapter 17: Exploring Opportunities in the Virtual World: Social Media

 Direct communications: Social media and networking provide a way for
you to speak directly and candidly with customers and prospects and
provide your customers and prospects with a forum for establishing
their own voice on the Internet. 
 Brand building: Social media and networking serve as other channels to
put your brand in front of the customer and keep shaping its identity in
real-time. 
 Competitive differentiation: You gain the opportunity to tell your story
over and over and set yourself apart from the competition. Over time,
you build brand awareness and increase customer loyalty.
 Relationship marketing: Blogs and other social media and networking
tools enable you to build personal, long-lasting relationships with your
customers that foster trust. Your prospects and customers come to
know you in a personal way never before achieved. Over time, you
develop lifelong relationships with your customers.
 Niche marketing: Blogs are very niche-specific. You can use them to
penetrate niche markets that are underserved.
 Media and public relations: The media relies on social media and net-
working, particularly in the form of blogs, for source material. As a
result, journalists call you, not your competition.
 Lead generation: Social networking tools offer a more personal form of
lead generation in that they enable you to establish rapport with readers
which fosters trust. Because of the personal interactions that social
media facilitates, prospects and clients respond to you with comments,
e-mails and other interactive opportunities. Over time that can mean
additional contacts from prospects and customers. 
 Expert positioning: Social media and networking enable you to articu-
late your viewpoints, knowledge, and expertise on matters pertaining to
your industry, your local community, and other areas of interest to you,
your clients, and your prospects. 
 Customer referrals: Not only does social media and networking foster
customer loyalty, but they also create a mini-lead-generation service 
for you. These “brand evangelists” promote you to family, friends, and
associates, demanding little, if any, additional effort on your part. For
additional details, check out the following section on word-of-mouth
marketing.
Blogs require very little technical expertise, although you may need some
training or assistance to customize your blog — to give it the desired look
and feel. Once it’s set up, posting messages is as easy as sending email 
messages.

Part IV: Prospecting for Sales Opportunities 

Creating buzz with word-of-mouth (WOM) marketing
Word-of-mouth (WOM) marketing, often referred to as viral marketing, is the
best marketing that ever was, is, and likely will be, and on the Internet, social
media and networking are like WOM on steroids. You can’t assign a dollar
figure to the value of having others talk positively about you, your company,
and your products and services, but you can certainly see the results. 
Not only do clients and prospects interact with you via your social media
platform, they also talk to one another . . . for good or bad. The people in
your social network can become your best brand-building evangelists,
spreading your message and your presence throughout their networks.
Instead of artificial, biased commercial messages, people can now get gen-
uine advice and answers from their peers on anything they’re looking for.
WOM marketing derives its power from the ability of consumers to influence
one another when making purchasing decisions. Blogging and other social
media and networking activities enable consumers to create an informal con-
sumer’s digest for recommending products and services. Consumers who are
placing lest trust in the marketing messages that corporate America has been
spewing out for years and who are more empowered to taking ownership of
the buying process, are now relying more on the word on the street to decide
where to spend their hard-earned money.
Sizing up the potential drawbacks
Social media and networking is not all positive. It adds transparency, which is
always a little dangerous. If you’re phony, somebody is going to spot it and
cry foul. If you upset a customer, that customer is likely to post a note of criti-
cism on your blog and perhaps other blogs where community members are
likely to see it. If you write in the wrong tone or voice, a sensitive individual
can take issue with what you said. In other words, people are going to talk
about you.
Some other potential drawbacks, especially relating to blogging are these:
 Social networking requires a time commitment to create posts, monitor
comments, answer questions, and respond to the messages that others
post.
 People can vandalize your blog by posting obscenities, vulgarities, or
racial epithets or by hacking into or crashing your site.
 Someone may try to use your blog to advertise their own products and
services.
 Competitors can pose as clients and post nasty messages.
271
Chapter 17: Exploring Opportunities in the Virtual World: Social Media

You can minimize the effects of potential drawbacks by knowing what you’re
doing or hiring a professional to create and manage your blog. You can draw
up an editorial schedule and compose a post once every week to ease the
burden of creating content, or take on guest bloggers to write content for
you. Vandalism can be controlled by putting the proper security checks in
place, monitoring posts, and automatically censoring obscenities. You can
even require that visitors provide their email address when posting a com-
ment to cut down on anonymous posts, which are more likely to contain
objectionable material.
Don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater. Just because you have a con-
cern about a particular aspect of social media or networking, don’t let that
spook you. You can usually find a solution or compromise to address your
concern. You may even be able to disable certain features of your blog that
you don’t want to deal with.

The business blogging tsunami
Beginning with Business Week’s cover feature
in May of 2005, mainstream business media 
has trumpeted the effectiveness of blogs as a
marketing medium. The following are a few
examples:
“The blog as business tool has arrived.
Some eight million Americans now publish
blogs and 32 million people read them,
according to the Pew Internet & American
Life Project. What began as a form of public
diary-keeping has become an important
supplement to a business’s online strategy:
Blogs can connect with consumers on a
personal level -- and keep them visiting a
company’s Web site regularly.” — Wall
Street Journal
Harvard Business School recently said 
that businesses “need to embrace the 
benefits of blogging.” In a recent Harvard
Management Communication letter the
revered business school gave full sup-
port to corporate blogging, saying blogs
enable companies “to connect with cus-
tomers online and advance corporate 
communications and marketing goals.” —
Harvard Management Communication
David Sifry, creator of blog search engine
Technorati reports, “New blog creation
continues to grow. We currently track over
100,000 new weblogs created every day,
which means that on average, two new
weblogs are created every second of every
day.” Technorati is tracking nearly 57 million
blogs in its database. 
Certainly, something this phenomenal cannot be
overlooked. As Business Week strongly asserts,
blogs are not a business elective, but indeed a
prerequisite.

Drawing Attention to Yourself with Blogs
Blogs are consumer magnets, primarily because search engines, such as
Google and Yahoo! love blogs. Keep in mind that when people start searching
for information on the Internet, they use a search engine. The higher your
Web site or blog ranking, the higher profile it has. Blogs do a much better job
than standard Web sites at feeding search engines what they’re hungry for —
fresh content and relevant links. While you may create a small Web site and
attract a small amount of traffic, a comparably sized blog can attract huge
crowds. 
In the following sections, I show you how to keep your blog on center stage
by updating its content regularly and populating it with relevant links that
attract attention.
Add a Google Site Map to your blog to improve its ranking with Google and
other search engines. To create a sitemap, you create a sitemap file and copy
it to the directory on your domain server where your site is stored. You then
sign into Google and tell Google the location of the sitemap file. For addi-
tional details about Google Site Map, visit www.google.com/webmasters/
sitemaps. If you’re not technically inclined, check our Blogging For Dummies
by Brad Hill or hire a Web designer. 
Updating your blog with fresh content
More than anything else, search engines value unique content. When a search
engine visits a Web site or blog, it looks for content that it hasn’t “seen” since
the last time it visited your site. Sites that are constantly updated with new
information tend to get higher rankings, so freshen up that content regularly.
When a search engine discovers a site that hasn’t been changed in weeks or
months, it “assumes” that the information is older or that nobody cares
about the site.
When posting entries in your blog, carefully select the words you use in post
titles and the bodies of the posts. Search engines look for repeated key words
and phrases to index. Think of very descriptive words or phrases that apply
to the content on your site and that the people you want to visit your site are
most likely to search for, and use them repeatedly. Over time, this “teaches”
the search engine what your site is about.
273
Chapter 17: Exploring Opportunities in the Virtual World: Social Media

Another way to include fresh content on your blog is to get other people to
freshen the content for you — encourage visitors to post comments. 
Populating your blog with relevant links
Search engines also love Web sites and blogs that are “well connected” —
that is, the site contains plenty of links pointing to other sites and is pointed
to by plenty of other sites. This sends a message to the search engine that the
site is a credible member of a community of Web sites and blogs, and not just
some fly-by-night operation. 
The following items suggest a few ways you can use a search engine’s prefer-
ence for well-connected sites to your advantage:
 Cross-market your Web site and blog: Insert links in your blog entries
to your company Web site and link to your blog from your company Web
site. The more links into and out of your blog, the more “Google Juice”
your produce and the higher your search engine listings.
 Populate our Blogroll with relevant listings: Woven into the fabric of
blogging are lists of blogs called blogrolls — links to other relevant blogs
and Web sites. Think of them as mini-directories to other sites in the
niche-neighborhood. Blogrolls enable search engines to better under-
stand the proposition of the site. In addition, as a blog gains credibility,
other bloggers link to the site, creating a wealth of inbound links from
other relevant sites that raise the blog’s credibility. 
 Add relevant links to posts: In addition to packing your blog posts with
relevant key words and phrases, add links to your posts that point to
other high-profile Web sites and blogs with content that’s related to
yours. In addition to drawing attention to your blog, this raises the pro-
file and credibility of other Web sites and blogs in your community.
Google offers a free tool called Google Analytics that can automatically track
and report on traffic streaming into your blog or Web site. It tracks the
number of visitors, the number of pages they view, which site directed them
to your site, and much more. All you do is copy a small script that Google
creates for you and paste it on every page of your blog or Web site. If you
don’t know how, check out Blogging For Dummies by Brad Hill or call a tech
savvy colleague. In a blog, all you have to do is paste it in one location, and
every page you create contains the tracking code. For details, check out
Google Analytics at www.google.com/analytics.

Part IV: Prospecting for Sales Opportunities 

Getting your blog discovered on Technorati
Technorati (www.technorati.com) is a search engine that focuses exclu-
sively on blogs. Until recently, it was considered the most comprehensive
blog search engine on the Internet, but recent statistics suggest that Google’s
blog search engine has surpassed it. Nevertheless, if you have a blog, you
should register it (claim it) on Technorati.
The process for claiming your blog on Technorati is fairly straightforward.
Visit www.technorati.com, register to become a member, click the link for
claiming your blog, and follow the instructions. You can enter keyword tabs
to raise your blog’s rank when Technorati visitors search for particular key
words or phrases.
Blogging software typically includes a ping feature that “pings” a search engine
automatically to notify it when information on your blog is updated, such as
when you post a new message. After you claim your blog on Technorati, look
for instructions on how to have your blog automatically ping Technorati. In
WordPress, select Options, Writing, and then scroll down to the Update Services
box and insert http://rpc.technorati.com/rpc/ping. Then, click
Update Options. Google’s Site Map feature, discussed earlier, automatically
pings Google whenever you update content on your blog.
Distributing your content with Really
Simple Syndication (RSS)
Are you wondering what that orange button is that you have seen on blogs
and other websites? It represents something called RSS, which stands for
Really Simple Syndication, among other things. RSS provides Internet users a
way of gathering and organizing content from websites and blogs through a
syndicated feed. It essentially allows you to create your own custom online
newspaper that pulls news and other information from a wide selection of
Web sites and blogs.
What makes RSS so valuable is that it prevents users from having to spend
hours surfing the Internet for fresh content because it’s all sent to the user
via an RSS newsreader, also called a feedreader or aggregator. A newsreader 
is a type of software whose purpose is to retrieve RSS “feeds.” If some sub-
scribes to your feed, whenever you update your blog, the person automati-
cally receives the new content.
275
Chapter 17: Exploring Opportunities in the Virtual World: Social Media

This is called permission marketing and it creates connections with con-
sumers and clients that are much stronger than spam e-mail and other unso-
licited forms of marketing.
Just how important is RSS for selling? Renowned Microsoft blogger Robert
Scoble summed it up best, “[I]f you have a marketing site and don’t have an
RSS feed today you should be fired.”
For additional details about creating RSS feeds, go to the source. Visit
Feedburner at www.feedburner.com or Newsgator at www.newsgator.
com. I also recommend Syndicating Web Sites with RSS Feeds For Dummies by
Ellen Finkelstein.
Converting blog traffic into sales
Attracting Internet traffic is nice, but it’s not an end in itself. At the end of the
day, a blog is a Web site, and any Web site can attract visitors. It’s what becomes
of the visitors when they arrive at the site that matters most. A marketing
Web site, whether static or dynamic (like a blog), has two goals:
 Establish credibility in the marketplace or industry. You establish credi-
bility by offering valuable information and resources. Credibility leads to
trust, and clients and prospects who trust you lead to sales.
 Capture leads to promising prospects. Web surfers are not looking for
blogs for blogs’ sake; they are looking for pertinent, useful content. Sites
that provide valuable content generate interest, comments, and leads.
By positioning your blog as a site with valuable content, you automati-
cally get more opportunities to capture leads owing to your increased
visibility in search engines.
The ultimate goal of your blog is to turn traffic into business. In the world of
sales and marketing, this is called lead generation. In Internet parlance, it’s
called conversions. It does little good to have traffic if that traffic does not
translate into something more tangible, such as an e-mail contact, phone call,
or other type of actionable item with the potential for generating additional
business transactions.
Traditional lead-generation systems are designed to highlight comparisons
and give readers the opportunity to compare features and benefits of different
products, services, and companies. This approach is a competitive perspec-
tive. An effective blog, however, establishes meaningful relationships with its
readers. The sole purpose is to create a substantive bond based on qualities
of trust, goodwill, respect, mutual appreciation, and open communication. 
276
Part IV: Prospecting for Sales Opportunities 

Establishing a Presence 
in Virtual Communities
Building relationships on the Internet freelance style by setting up your own
blog is like having your own booth at a sales convention. Clients and
prospects can choose to visit if they want to, and if they can find you using
Internet search engines or perhaps links from other Web sites and blogs.
Another way to rub elbows online is to register at any of several existing vir-
tual communities, such as MySpace, Facebook, YouTube, and Digg. Each com-
munity has its own culture that attracts a unique crowd, so you may find one
community a better fit for you than another.
In the following sections, I lead you on a guided tour of some of the more
popular virtual communities, to assist you in choosing a hangout that’s best
suited to you and what you sell and optimize its marketing potential.
Marketing on MySpace
MySpace is the King and Queen of social networking communities, reporting
over 150 million users, although how many of those user are actively blog-
ging on MySpace is up for debate. MySpace currently drives more traffic to
online retailers than MSN Search, and that traffic isn’t all from kids who are
too young to drive. More than half of MySpace visitors are at least 35 years
old, and two-thirds are 25 or older. 
If you think MySpace has no commercial use, think again. Companies that
actively market on MySpace include Apple, Nokia, Honda, and Microsoft.
Prior to the Internet, word-of-mouth marketing was limited to the relatively
small social circles most people were part of. For the most part, church groups,
neighbors, golfing buddies, work associates, fellow classmates, and client refer-
rals comprised the entirety of a salesperson’s network. Social media networks
like MySpace can reach far beyond that and grow organically and exponen-
tially. The Internet has made the “six degrees of separation” idea a reality. 
I’m not about to provide you with complete instructions on how to create
your own MySpace page and navigate the community. You can visit MySpace
yourself at www.myspace.com and poke around to discover the basics or
check out MySpace For Dummies by Ryan Hupfer, Mitch Maxson, and Ryan
Williams. In the following sections, I highlight the key points of using MySpace
as a marketing tool.
277
Chapter 17: Exploring Opportunities in the Virtual World: Social Media

Making “friends” on MySpace
Marketing successfully on MySpace is all about creating friends, not pushing
product. In fact, if you try to push product, you’re either going to drive away
all of your friends or get booted off of MySpace. Either way, it’s a lose-lose
scenario.
After you create a MySpace page and enter information to define your profile,
MySpace presents you with a list of prospective friends. I suggest that you
add all the people from your prospect list to your “friends” list, and then add
all of their friends, and so on. Don’t expect everyone to accept your invitation
to become friend. Establishing a circle of friends takes time, so have patience.
Reports suggest that one-third of those who receive your invitation eventu-
ally accept it.
You have to be a friend to have a friend. Contribute to other MySpace
member pages to populate those pages with valuable content, insights, and
other items of interest. When people see that you take an interest in them
and in their pages, they’re more likely to take an interest in yours.
Taking the soft-sell approach
Post content that isn’t sell, sell, sell. If you do so, it is unlikely your Friends
will stay Friendly. Write as if you’re speaking to a real friend, not as a com-
pany. If you’re an expert on a particular topic, offer advice, answer questions,
suggest ways to do something faster, cheaper, or better. 
By offering content that engages, entertains, and educates, you build a loyal
following of MySpace members who are more likely to trust you, and when
the time is right, more likely to buy from you.
Targeting a demographic
MySpace enables you to target a specific demographic or a group with similar
interests. Upon arriving at MySpace, click on browse then on advanced. You
can then browse user profiles by age, sex, religion, education, location, hob-
bies, disposable income, and other information provided by the MySpace
Members. 
Targeting the correct demographic enables you to maximize the power of
your marketing efforts rather than coming across as a spammer who’s simply
taking up Internet bandwidth through mass mailings.
Linking into and out of your MySpace page
Even if you do nothing else on MySpace, I recommend that you create a page
that links to your other Web sites or blogs. If someone happens upon your
page on MySpace, you can then use your MySpace page to drive traffic to
your Web site or blog. 
278
Part IV: Prospecting for Sales Opportunities 

Create a link from your Web site or blog to your MySpace page, as well. By
cross-linking your MySpace page with your other sites, you create your own
mini spider Web, an online community of pages that may eventually attract
more attention from search engines like Google and Yahoo!
Buying banner ads
Marketing by building friendships isn’t the only way to sell on MySpace. You
can also buy banner impressions for somewhere in the neighborhood of $5
per 1,000 impressions (appearances). The minimum buy for a banner cam-
paign is reportedly $5,000 to $10,000. 
To find out more about advertising on MySpace, click the Advertise link at
the very bottom of the page.
Getting some air time on YouTube
YouTube became a cultural phenomenon seemingly overnight, allowing
anyone with a creative imagination and a digital camcorder to produce and
distribute their own short video clips online. Commercial applications of
YouTube in marketing, advertising, and sales, however, are still in their early
stages. While corporations have dipped their toes into online video as a new
advertising vehicle, success stories from salespeople are still anecdotal.
Having said that, however, I’m sure that some salespeople are going to har-
ness the power of YouTube and put it to work for them in boosting sales. As I

Weaving your own spider web
Successful social networking hinges on your
ability to weave your own spider web to snare
clients. It’s all about making contacts. Build
strategic contact points on the Internet wher-
ever your clients and promising prospects tend
to gather and then cross-promote these contact
points (your Web sites, blogs, and social net-
working pages). This creates a mini spider web
that can begin to expand both organically and
exponentially.
The most effective online salespeople create
multiple participation points — places where
clients and prospects want to interact and
engage. By testing these new social media 
tools you can determine which ones have par-
ticipants who appreciate innovative new
approaches and the opportunity to connect with
salespeople who are people first and sales-
people second.
Your prospects and clients need to feel empow-
ered to search and find the information they are
looking for without being pressured. Then need
interaction, participation, and the approval of
the online community to buy your products from
you. Social networking provides them with all
this and more.

currently see it, the biggest opportunities for driving sales with YouTube
come in the form of soft-sell videos, such as the following:
 Educational videos that show how to use a new product or one of its
more complicated features.
 Entertaining videos that contain some mention or appearance of the
product, perhaps even a video that makes fun of the product.
 Third-party testimonials, in which a YouTube member posts a video clip
of herself singing the praises of a particular product or company.
Stay away from posting any obviously commercial ads on YouTube. They’re
likely to drive away more customers than they can possibly attract. If you
find a video on YouTube, however, that promotes a product or service you
sell, consider linking to it, adding it to your marketing materials, and tagging
it (adding a search term to it, so clients and prospects can easily find it by
performing a search).
Dig it, man, Digg it!
Looking for a way to generate links to your business website or blog, drive
traffic and increase search engine rankings? The social news site Digg (www.
digg.com) may be the answer you’ve been looking for. Digg is a site where
regular folks like you and me can submit stories for consideration. Other users
read the stories and “digg” them. That’s Web 2.0 nomenclature for rating a
story. If your story receives enough diggs, it gets promoted to the front page. 
The site, which averages 1.5 million visits per day, utilizes the “wisdom of
crowds.” In other words, no editorial staff is at work screening stories and
deciding on what makes the headlines and what get’s buried. It’s all up to you
and your peers to make the news.
What are the marketing benefits? Let’s say you write an informational article
and post it to your Web site or blog. By submitting it to Digg, which you can
do with a single click if you install Digg on your blog, you leverage the chance
of that article getting linked to by a large number of readers, including other
bloggers. 
Digg facilitates viral marketing. The end result is that many more people may
read the article than would otherwise read it, more are likely visit your blog,
and search engines see this activity and reward you for it. All in all, Digg pro-
vides an excellent means by which your quality content can get read, linked
to, and ranked in the search engines. As always, remember not to be overtly
selling in your blog posts. You may send those posts to Digg, but no one else
is going to dig ’em.

Living a “Second Life”
I was recently asked when blogs would become the “neighborhoods we
choose to live in.” What the inquirer meant was how long will it be before we
communicate and collaborate with people more via our blogs than in real
life? I’m not sure that will happen, but many people are now spending at least
a portion of their lives as virtual creatures in the online world of Second Life
(www.secondlife.com). As a salesperson, if you want to hook up with
these folks, you’d better get a second life of your own.
Second Life is a fast-expanding online world, “imagined, created and owned
by its residents.” It has been attracting tech savvy marketers, including
Toyota, Starwood Hotels, IBM, GM, and music and book companies. These
firms are using the Second Life world for branding purposes.
As a salesperson, as an entrepreneur, you have a chance to move faster than
large corporations and establish yourself as an early adopter. If you wait too
long to establish your presence in your target market with any social media
tools, you may find yourself competing in a marketplace that is already domi-
nated by earlier adopters. Gen X and Gen Y consumers are using these online
social communities to communicate, collaborate, and find information. Don’t
you want to be where they are?
281
Chapter 17: Exploring Opportunities in the Virtual World: Social Media
Second Life branding, a case study
Second Life marketers aren’t just large compa-
nies. A Second Life resident who has created
an “in world” brand and products is Gareth
Lancaster — who sells “in world” roller skates.
Yes, you read that right, he sells virtual roller
skates — 50,000 pairs to date. According to
Second Life, residents of this virtual world sold
goods and services in the amount of $328,517 —
that’s real dollars for virtual goods. This kind of
money wouldn’t be spent if there weren’t lots of
like minded people taking this online social net-
working thing very seriously. 
In discussing how real world brands might think
about how to access this lucrative market,
Lancaster was quoted in the New York Times
article as comparing “the situation with a com-
pany doing business in China for the first time
and belatedly realizing that the place is already
teeming with companies that know the market
inside out.” While these “RL” (real life) firms
might have years of experience and knowledge
about branding and marketing, what they do not
realize, says Lancaster, is “that they’re going to
have to compete against a completely different
marketplace, which is basically the residents of
Second Life.” In other words, while they may
only be kids or RL employed people creating “in
world” lives and businesses, they got there first,
and the old school “experts” have some catch-
ing up to do.

Second Life can be a bit intimidating for nontechnical users. It isn’t quite as
intuitive as creating a blog, but if you stick with it, you can create your own
avatar (a representative of you online), buy and sell property, and set up a
store where you can sell real goods or offer RL services. You can also set up a
press conference, build a community of fans of your product, or set up mock
demos of your product or service for Second Life residents to try out. 
Second Life may be online, but it can have real-world results.

Teaming Up with
Your Customers . . .
and Competitors

In this part . . .
Your success may be limited by the lackluster success
of the people around you — particularly your cus-
tomers, but curiously enough, your competitors, too.
Surround yourself with success, and you soon find that
the crowds you’ve assisted are the ones who are lifting
you upward toward and perhaps even beyond your goals.
While the rest of this book is all about you, the chapters in
this part turn your focus to those around you. Here, you
discover various ways to reach out and achieve much more
than you could possibly achieve on your own by investing
in the success of others.

Chapter 18
Focusing on Your Client’s Success
In This Chapter
 Familiarizing yourself with your clients’ business
 Documenting your clients’ needs
 Tailoring products and services to specific clients
 Letting your client know how much you care
 Shedding any sexist sales techniques
F
or your business to thrive, your clients must thrive, so part of your job
as a top salesperson is to provide your clients with the products, serv-
ices, and information they need to achieve success. This may include provid-
ing your clients with training and support to effectively implement a new
software system, offering articles and tips on how to use your product or 
service more efficiently and effectively, developing financing solutions to
make purchases more affordable, and even referring business to your clients. 
When clients see that you’re committed to their success, they’re much more
committed to your success and more capable of doing something about it —
by purchasing more products and services, referring business to you, and
perhaps even presenting opportunities that can make your business more
profitable. 
This chapter takes the focus off of your own success and refocuses your
efforts on the success of your clients. By putting the techniques and tips I
reveal in this chapter to work for you, you soon realized that this client-
focused approach delivers immeasurable benefits to you and your company.
Throughout this book, I use the words “customer” and “client” interchange-
ably, but these two words do have different meanings. A customer is some-
one who buys a product or service from you without having much of a
relationship with you, either implied or in writing. A client, on the other
hand, is someone with whom you develop a lasting relationship.

Getting to Know Your Client’s Business
Prospective clients don’t care about the products you’re peddling. They
don’t care about your business. They care about their own business. If they’re
smart, they also care about the success of their clients. What they need from
you are products and services that enable them to achieve their goals faster,
cheaper, or with fewer hassles.
To make your products more attractive, you have to know a little something
about your client’s business — the challenges they must overcome, the daily
annoyances, the clients they serve, and the most pressing problem they are
currently trying to solve. By understanding how your clients run their busi-
ness, you can tailor your products and presentation to better meet the needs
of each individual client.
People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.
Ask questions to identify the problem they are trying to solve. Asking ques-
tions shows you care. Once they realize that you understand their circum-
stance, they are more likely to listen to the solution you have to offer.

Hiring an assistant who knows how to sell
As I discuss in Chapter 13, I often hire and use
virtual assistants (freelancers who market their
services on the Internet) to take on much of the
workload. Like employees, virtual assistants
can be good or bad, and you may have to go
through a few of them before you find one that’s
right for you.
One evening I was working on finding another
virtual assistant to take on some responsibilities
in my real estate business, and I came across
an assistant who looked promising. I called over
to my close advisor, Lois, who was working
nearby and told her that I thought I had found
the perfect fit. She said she wasn’t so sure. She
came over to my desk and asked me keep
searching as she supervised my search.
We came across the Web site of Hamric
Enterprises. Lois liked the site and what Hamric
Enterprises apparently had to offer, so I called
and left a voicemail message. About an hour
later, we received a call from Kandra Hamric,
owner and operator.
Wow! Were we impressed! Kandra was ener-
getic, knowledgeable, and understood my
needs immediately. But what knocked it out of
the park for me was that she had taken the time
to Google me, visit my Web sites, and under-
stand who I was before she called, so that she
could address me and my company’s needs
better. I have always appreciated that about
Kandra. She has since become my number-one
virtual assistant, oversees many of our other
assistants, and has become an integral part of
our one-on-one coaching team.
If you’re hiring an assistant to work directly with
clients, I recommend you find someone who
knows how to sell — how to show your clients
she cares and build relationships.

One of the best ways to establish a mutually beneficial relationship with busi-
ness clients is to refer your clients to their business. Be sure to tell the clients
you refer to mention that they were referred by you. This sends a message
loud and clear that you are dedicated to the success of your client.
Researching your client’s business
You can hire a marketing research firm to gather information about your
clients, but doing your own research may provide you with more valuable
information as well as giving you the opportunity to connect with your
clients without the pressure of having to make a sale.
How do you go about doing this market research on your own? Following are
some suggestions:
 Visit the company’s Web site. If the company has a press area, check
out the latest press releases and other publicly available information
about the company. 
 Do a thorough Web search: Google the company, Google your contact
person, Google the company’s phone number, and Google the industry.
This gives you details you may not find on the company’s Web site,
including advertisements and what that company’s customers are
saying about the company.
Google allows you to perform several types of searches. In addition to
searching the Web, search Google News. Also, click the more>> link to
search blogs, products, and discussion groups. You can even use Google
Earth to view an aerial photo of the company. The more you know about
the company, the less likely they will say No when you call.
 Distribute a questionnaire. Post a questionnaire on the Web or send it
via email, and let your clients know that any information they offer is
confidential. Don’t burden your clients with a lot of questions. Simply
request the person’s name, e-mail address, phone number, mailing
address, job title, purchasing power, how they use your product, and the
biggest issue or problem they are currently facing. 
 Attend industry conferences. Find out the which conferences your best
clients attend, and try to get into those conferences, so you can discover
more about your client’s business and perhaps even network with more
clients like these.
 Host a client forum. You can do this online or in person. Invite your
clients to gather and talk shop, and state clearly up front, that during this
time, you’re not going to be selling anything. Let your clients know that
287
Chapter 18: Focusing on Your Client’s Success

you simply want to connect with them personally and hear what they
really need from you.
 Talk to your client service reps. If your company has separate depart-
ments for sales and client service, open the lines of communication. As a
salesperson, you should know what the client service reps know about
your clients.
Professionals who are passionate about their business love to describe what
they do and are often more willing than you may think to provide information
about their company. Ask to speak with the president, CEO, or CFO. Express
an interest in taking a tour of the company. This enables you to connect with
company personnel in a low-pressure setting and gather information without
immediately delivering some heavy-handed sales pitch.
Finding out about your client’s client
Although your primary focus should always be on your client, knowing about
the needs of your client’s client can often give you a competitive advantage. 
Identify the people that your client needs to please in order to be successful,
and then do what you can in terms of product development and your sales
presentation to prove that you can assist your client in pleasing her client.
When I’m working on selling a house for a client, I have to constantly remain
aware of the needs of my client’s client — the person looking to buy a house.
To better serve my clients, I find out from their clients what they thought of
the house after looking at it. I then pass that feedback along to my clients
who can then, perhaps, make a few adjustments to make their property more
marketable. If the prospective buyers commented that the yard looks cluttered
or the house seems dark, my clients can attend to those areas before another
set of prospective buyers tour the premises. I have to know what buyers are
looking for in order give my seller a competitive edge in the market.
I also have to be aware of my client’s clients needs during the negotiating
process. I can think of countless numbers of times when a prospective buyer
said something like, “I would buy the house if it only had . . .” I have to be
able to end that sentence, so I can relay the information to my client and
determine whether we can supply that missing piece.
Of course, knowing the needs of your client’s client isn’t always enough. You
still have to convince your client to make the necessary adjustments. You
have to be able to prove that the change or sacrifice is in your client’s best
interest. This is where your hand-to-hand sales skills really come into play.

Discovering What Your Client 
Needs to Succeed
Your client may not always need what you have to offer, but you should be
aware of those needs all the same and assist in any way possible to meet
them. When I sell homes, for example, most of my paying clients haven’t the
cash to buy a home — they have to finance the purchase. I’m not a bank, but
I can put the buyer in touch with a loan officer who can assist them. 
Someone who’s selling a house has other needs. They may need to find a new
home, have the roof repaired, or have the house painted before we can list it.
I can refer the seller to people who can handle that. A client facing foreclosure
is likely to have entirely different needs — primarily the need to know her
options and the deadline to make a decision. I offer the person education and

Golden Tee Golf
My co-author, Joe, co-authored another book
with Incredible Technologies, the creators of
the popular coin-op video game, Golden Tee
Golf. Deconstructing Golden Tee LIVE describes
how developers designed the game to appeal to
several clients, including the players, the oper-
ators (who purchased, delivered, and main-
tained the games), and the location owners (the
owners of the establishments where the games
were placed).
The players obviously wanted a game that was
loads of fun to play, and the developers certainly
focused on making the best video golf game 
on the planet, but the operators and location
owners had other needs. The operators needed
an accounting system, for example, that could
automatically calculate the splits — how much
the operator received, how much he had to pay
the location owner, how much of the money
went to Incredible Technologies, and how much
he would owe in taxes. The game developers
designed an accounting system right into the
game and made it accessible online, so operators
could check their machines from a remote loca-
tion using a personal computer and the Internet.
The location owners had a different need. They
needed patrons to stick around and order more
food and drinks, so developers added a display
to the top of the game that showed tournament
standings — patrons would stick around after
playing a round of golf to see how they did, and
when they stuck around, they usually ate and
drank more.
By focusing on the needs of its clients and its
clients’ clients, Incredible Technologies was
able to carve out a niche in the declining market
of coin-op video games and take the lead in a
highly competitive industry. Follow their lead by
focusing on the needs of all the people in the
food chain who stand to benefit from your prod-
ucts and services.

guidance. I become a conduit for putting people in touch with one another, and
by helping them, I strengthen my relationship with the people I put in touch.
The point here is that each client may be in a unique situation with needs
that differ from those of your other clients. Place yourself in a position in
which you can meet all those needs, and you immediately expand your 
client base. 
In the following sections, I touch on the various types of needs your clients
are likely to have and offer suggestions on how to more effectively cater to
those needs.
Identifying specific needs
You profit by selling a product or service, but products and services are not
always what your clients need most. They may need money, education, quali-
fied personnel, and so on. By being able to offer your clients more of what
they need, even if doing so does not directly improve your bottom line, you
gain client loyalty. 
Following are some suggestions of what your clients may need that you can
offer indirectly:
 Products: If you’re in a service industry and you know of products that
your client may need, refer your client to a supplier who carries those
products. In addition to assisting your client, you steer some business to
the supplier, who may return the favor later.
 Services: If you sell products and know of a service that could benefit
your client, refer the client to the service provider.
 Information: Information is power, or, as my co-author Joe tells me they
say in the publishing business, “Content is King!” Offer your clients the
information they need to become more successful in their businesses.
You can do this in person, by creating a newsletter or posting the infor-
mation on your Web site or blog, e-mailing your clients, or even mailing
the information via the postal service.
 Training: Businesses often suffer by selling products or services and
then failing to properly train clients on how to use them or optimize
their use. Consider offering free or premium training to get clients up to
speed. You may be able to automate the training by posting training
materials online — text-based training, online seminars, training videos,
podcasts, and so on. See Chapter 16 for more about selling in the multi-
media marketplace.
 Financing: Are your products and services affordable for most of your
clients and prospective clients? If not, consider offering some form of
financing or recommending a lender who can work with the client to
290
Part V: Teaming Up with Your Customers . . . and Competitors 

design a personalized financing package. You may be able to open
another sales channel by selling your products and services to startup
companies. When selling to startups, you have an added incentive to
team up with the client for success, because if that startup business
doesn’t make it, you may not get paid!
 Community: Clients, especially those who are just starting out in busi-
ness, often crave a community from which they can obtain support and
resources. By becoming a community center for related businesses in
your area, you boost your own credibility and feed your clients’ need for
community.
 Personnel: In Chapter 14, I encourage you to tap the power of R-Commerce
(Relationship-Commerce) by gathering the names and contact informa-
tion of everyone you meet. When a client’s success is limited by a lack of
qualified personnel, you may be able to recommend qualified candidates
for specific positions. Assuming you recommend high-quality candidates,
they will sell for you every day they show up for work and do an out-
standing job.
You may be able to save a considerable amount of money by combining train-
ing with community. On your Web site, create a discussion forum area where
clients can gather to share information, post questions, and answer one
another’s questions. One or more employees at your company who are in
charge of client support and training can monitor the forums or blog.
Rack your brain and go back through your files to find questions that clients
have asked in the past and you have answered. Post these questions first.
Most questions are common, and the answers benefit even those who don’t
raise their hands.
291
Chapter 18: Focusing on Your Client’s Success
Getting down to business
Although you want to show genuine concern for a
client’s current situation, you don’t always have to
be overly nice about it. Sometimes, being curt and
getting down to brass tacks is the best approach.
When I’m dealing with clients who are facing
foreclosure, for example, I often hit them with a
rat-at-tat-tat series of very targeted personal
questions to find out exactly what’s going on
and how the homeowners arrived at this point.
My questions can make any of my associates
who accompany me very uncomfortable. Some
of them feel as though I’m being too blunt and
not compassionate enough.
I’ve found, however, that my approach is most
effective and expedient. By asking personal
questions (the “ugly” questions) early on, I can
quickly assess the situation, find out who I’m
really dealing with, take the “personal” out of it,
and get on with the business of assisting the
homeowners either save their home or at least
make their loss less painful.
Ask questions in the right tone of voice, but
don’t avoid asking ugly questions if you have to.
The more information you have, the better the
assistance you can provide.

When I am with a client and they ask a question, I often respond with “Wow,
that’s a great question.” Instead of making the client feel stupid for asking a
question, it makes them feel like a genius and encourages them to ask more
questions, which makes my job even easier.
Adjusting your business model 
to meet client needs
When I’m out coaching and mentoring salespeople, I notice two kinds of busi-
nesses — those that adapt to the changing needs of clients and those that
fail. As a salesperson, you may think that your company’s CEO should be in
charge of guiding the business to success, but you’re the person battling on
the front line. You’re the one who has direct contact with clients on a daily
basis. And you’re the one who feels the pain most directly when your com-
pany is failing to meet the needs of your clients.
292

Adapting to client needs in the real estate market
In the Detroit metropolitan area that I service,
drastic changes in our local market and econ-
omy have forced us to make sweeping changes
in the way we service our customers, particu-
larly home buyers. Currently, the average
person is carrying more debt and has less cash
than in previous years. Clients are no longer
receiving yearly bonuses and many have taken
pay cuts to maintain jobs. Many people simply
do not have a great deal of cash anymore, but
they still want to own a home. 
We are finding that we need to do much more
matchmaking with buyers and sellers than in
the past. We have to find sellers who are will-
ing and able to assist with the financing — to
contribute toward down payments and closing
costs for a potential buyer. Not every seller is in
the position, so every transaction requires a dif-
ferent approach and some creative thinking.
We’ve also had to build a larger referral network
of lenders, mortgage brokers, and loan officers
to service our clients. Not all lenders offer the
same financing options, and many clients today
have specific needs for financing. We need to
be able to hook up buyers with people who can
help them. We’ve developed relationships with
multiple lenders and have to keep an open flow
of communication to provide clients with accu-
rate, timely financing information.
With the increase in the foreclosures and REO
(Real Estate Owned or bank-owned) business,
potential buyers are in greater need of contrac-
tors and repair services than ever before. In
today’s market, a buyer is more apt to buy a
bank-owned home in as-is condition. We must
have a large base of professionals to refer to
our clients — professionals who will represent
us in the best possible fashion and not damage
our relationship with the client. We have to find
people who do outstanding, affordable work,
because their performance reflects on us.
When changes in the economy, your industry,
and other areas affect your clients, you have to
be ready, willing, and able to embrace the
change, adapt, and serve your clients in a way
that brings them closer to success. You can’t
spend time and waste energy complaining
about it.

Whenever you become aware that your company is dropping the ball, com-
municate your perceptions to company management. Describe exactly what
you think needs to be done to better serve the clients. You have a vested
interest in your company’s success, so act like it.
Whenever anyone has an unmet need, the person takes action to fill that
need. This is usually what happens when married couples get divorced, but it
happens in business, too. If you’re not offering your clients what they need,
they are going to find it elsewhere. Be constantly vigilant of their changing
needs. What your clients need today may not be what they needed yesterday.
You are only as good as your last transaction, your last sale. If you fail some-
one you have lost the referral of 200 to 250 people. That is why you must align
yourself with people that have the same integrity and the same commitment.
Integrating Sales with Product
Development and Client Service
When clients choose a supplier, they’re usually looking for more than a prod-
uct or service. They’re buying your reputation for quality and reliability, the
promise of excellent client service, perhaps additional education and train-
ing, and a host of other things you may consider intangible. What you’re sell-
ing is a whole package, including yourself.
293
Chapter 18: Focusing on Your Client’s Success
Tossing your clients a bonus
Remain on the lookout for anything you can do
to make your client’s life a little easier. I do this
myself, and I observe other top-producing
salespeople do the same thing in their own,
unique ways.
Sharon, a top-notch car salesperson who 
happened to sell a car to my wife, Kathleen, is 
a natural at looking out for her clients. She
accommodates the client. Instead of calling to
have her client drive to the dealership to pick up
their new car, she delivers it and picks up the
trade-in.
When Sharon found a great deal on garage
door openers, she bought about a dozen of them
at 50 percent off. She sold them to her clients at
cost. None of her clients complained, but an
envious colleague mentioned it to management,
and Sharon was fired. Now perhaps Sharon
should have gone to management to ask per-
mission first, but if I were her manager, I’d be
giving her a bonus rather than a pink slip.
Sharon is a perfect example of a salesperson
who provided her clients with something extra.
Sharon became a salesperson for another deal-
ership for a while. After time, the dealership that
fired her realized that they had made a huge
mistake and recruited her again. So she is back
selling and servicing her clients.
Take the extra step. Look for opportunities to
pay your clients a bonus.

As you present your products and services to prospective clients, don’t leave
out these “intangibles,” especially when you’re selling to a client who just
fired her previous supplier on the grounds of being unable to meet these
other needs.
Some companies keep their departments overly isolated. Product develop-
ment, customer service, sales, and other departments pretty much keep to
themselves. To serve your clients more effectively, open up the lines of com-
munication. Knowledge is power. The more you distribute the knowledge, the
more you empower everyone in your company to make a difference.
If you don’t know, say so. In an effort to appear as though you know every-
thing, you can bruise your credibility. Salespeople often answer a questions
before fully understanding them. Worse yet, they fake it, pretending to know
the answer. When a client asks a question, take a moment to digest it before
offering an answer. If you don’t know, say you don’t know and that you are
going to have to look into it and get back with them.
Your client needs to have the confidence that you “know your stuff’ better than
anyone else out there — that you give them an advantage over the next person.
This isn’t easy, because first you really do have to “know your stuff,” and that
takes time, research, and experience. You have to be the total package before
you can deliver it. If your client believes that you are a smart, honest, hard-
working professional who is an expert in your field, and you care about their
needs, they will use you and refer you to their friends and family.
Communicating Your Commitment 
to Your Client
Your clients need to feel the love, and the only way they can feel it is if you show
it, both by words, non-verbal cues, and decisive action that shows you care:
1. Listen to what your client has to say. You have two ears and one mouth,
so use them in that proportion. Don’t go on the defensive, no matter
how confrontational your client becomes. Absorb the hit.
2. Respond, first by restating the client’s concern or complaint to show
that you fully understand and then go one step further to express
your empathy — you not only understand the situation, but you also
feel the client’s pain. Most clients simply want someone to validate
their feelings. Make a note of what they have to say so you can review
their questions and concerns later and address them in a way that fills
your client with confidence.
294
Part V: Teaming Up with Your Customers . . . and Competitors 

3. Present one or more solutions. After giving the client’s situation or
problem due consideration, try to formulate one or more solutions, and
present those as some possibilities. 
4. Ask your client for any additional solutions she can think of.
5. Team up with your client to arrive at a solution you can both live with
and that serves both of your interests.
6. Take action immediately, if not sooner. Once you’ve arrived at a solu-
tion, implement it as soon as possible. A sure way to lose a client is to
make a promise and then fail to follow up on it. 
7. Keep the client informed of the progress. Your client may not notice
that you’re making an effort unless you keep that client posted through-
out the process, from the time you agree on a solution until the time
you’ve resolved the issue. You can keep the client in the loop in any
number of ways — email, phone calls, or a Web site that gives them
access to the service, product, or progress on a particular project.
You don’t have to wait until your client has a problem or an issue that needs
tending to. Become proactive in serving your clients’ needs, especially their
need to know that you care about them. In Chapter 12, I talk about my daily
Hour of Power, in which I get on the phone for an hour and place 100 calls to
people I know to express in various ways just how much I care about them.
The key to the Hour of Power is to not sell. Simply show your clients that
you’re thinking about them.
All of your clients don’t speak the same language. Some of them want to hear
that you’re looking out for their best interests. Others would rather see it in
your performance and what you do on a daily basis to make them more suc-
cessful. Some clients prefer receiving gifts, special deals, referrals, or addi-
tional training. Identify the language that each client speaks, and then speak
to your client in that language.
Reinforcing a positive relationship
Clients, especially your best clients, need and deserve praise and other forms
of positive reinforcement throughout your relationship. Here are a few tips on
how to provide these positive strokes:
 Let them talk. People love to talk about themselves, so let them. Spend
less time talking about how great you are and how great your company
and products are and more time listening to how great your client is.
 Pat them on the back. When a customer asks a good question or makes
a suggestion, give them a “Wow,” as in “Wow, that’s an excellent ques-
tion,” or “Wow, that’s a great idea.”

Chapter 18: Focusing on Your Client’s Success

 KISS up to the client. No, I’m not saying that you need to cater to the
client’s every whim. I’m saying KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid. Don’t over-
complicate issues with clients. They have better things to think about.
 Let your client set the pace, but you drive. From the beginning, let the
client take the lead and set the pace. You want to be driving the car but
making your client feel as though she’s steering.
 Know your stuff. You need to know the product, service or process so
well that you have the ability to educate and overcome any pre-conceived
ideas.
Ask for endorsements and testimonials. My executive assistant, Lois, led our
foreclosure department and collected a host of testimonials and endorsements
from clients. I told her to create a book and lay it out in the front lobby, so other
clients could look at them while they were waiting. If you do this, make sure
you have a backup copy, just in case the book “disappears.” Remember that
complaints come naturally, but unless you ask for an endorsement, testimo-
nial, or reference, you are likely to receive only a few.
Fielding complaints
A certain portion of the population consists of natural complainers. If you
handed them five bags of gold nuggets, they would whine about the bags
being too heavy. Over time, you pick up various techniques for spotting these
people and can avoid taking them on as clients, but you’re still going to have
to handle some complaints, particularly valid complaints. Here are some tips
for dealing with complaints most expeditiously:
 Address complaints immediately. Small problems can escalate in a
hurry if they are not addressed immediately. You don’t want to give your
client time to stew about it and post a bunch of negative PR on the Web.
 Clear up misunderstandings. Most complaints result from miscommuni-
cation, so you can address the problem simply by clarifying something
you said or wrote. In many cases, a client simply wants someone to
listen and show genuine concern.
 Keep clients posted. If the problem is due to something other than a
communication issue, fix the problem and then let your client know that
the problem has been taken care of. If you receive a complaint in writing,
respond in writing and follow up with a phone call. 
 Keep management posted. If you feel that you have done all that you
can do and you know that management will be contacted next you need
to go to management first, explaining the whole situation, and if you
have been wrong disclose that as well. This will help. A good manager
ultimately gets you involved again to resolve the issue and use it as an
educational experience.

Part V: Teaming Up with Your Customers . . . and Competitors 

The customer is not always right. If a client becomes completely unmanage-
able, fire them. Let them down softly by saying something like, “I don’t think
that we are compatible, and I believe that you would be better served by
someone else.” This isn’t easy when you are first starting out or when you are
in a sales slump, but this is the best option for both you and your client.
Cumbersome clients sap your energy and detract from more productive 
pursuits.

Selling to Multicultural Customers
In This Chapter
 Understanding the multicultural buyer mindset
 Meeting and greeting customers from other cultures
 Adjusting your approach to accommodate cultural differences 
 Haggling to win respect
 Adapting customer service to diverse needs
U
nknowingly and unintentionally, you could be limiting the scope of
future sales by ignoring or even offending a huge potential market —
minorities. 
Now, “minority” may sound like a tiny market, but the combined annual
buying power of this group in America exceeds the gross domestic product of
all but nine countries in the entire world. The Hispanic population alone in
the U.S. is larger than the entire population of Canada. Yet sadly, this is an
opportunity that many salespeople overlook. Most American sales profes-
sionals actually turn off minority buyers without ever knowing how or why
they offend them.
To grab your fair share of the multicultural market, you have to adjust your
practices to meet the unique needs of people who have come here from all
over the globe: Hispanics, African Americans, Asians, Middle Easterners, and
other groups. Collectively, these minorities in America buy nearly $2 trillion
in goods and services every year. Are you getting your share of that market?
In this chapter, I team up with diversity and sales expert Michael Soon Lee of
EthnoConnect (www.EthnoConnect.com) to show you how to adjust your
strategies to the needs of buyers from other cultures, so you can instantly
grow your market by at least a third!

You may have had interactions with people from diverse cultures already, but
they seemed uninterested in what you had to offer or you just never got to
the point of doing business with them. This probably means that they put
you to the test and somehow you failed. It doesn’t mean they didn’t want to
buy. When minorities return over and over without buying, it means they
don’t trust the environment enough to make a commitment. Only you can
turn that around and create an environment in which they feel more comfort-
able buying something.
Testing Your Multicultural Aptitude
The first step in becoming more aware of other cultures as a salesperson is to
determine just how tuned in or tuned out you already are. On EthnoConnect.
com, Michael has an online quiz that you can take to determine how much
you know about dealing with customers and clients from other countries and
cultures. If you register (by entering your name and email address) and take
the quiz online, you can have your quiz automatically graded. Figure 19-1 fea-
tures a subset of questions from that quiz, so you can test your knowledge
about selling to multicultural customers. 
To grade yourself, check your answers against the following answer key:
1. What is the most appropriate greeting when first meeting a male mul-
ticultural customer?
C. Wait for him to do what’s comfortable for him 
Do not automatically stick your hand out. Wait for him to do what is com-
fortable for his culture. See details below.
2. When a major purchase will be financed, what should you never ask?
A. How much of a down payment do you have? 
Many groups, particularly Hispanics and Asians, tend not to trust banks
so may keep cash hidden in and around their homes. Asking about the
down payment could subject them to home invasion robberies.
3. When exchanging business cards with a multicultural customer you
should be sure to:
C. Present your card with both hands 
Always present your card with both hands with the lettering facing the
customer. Accept their card with your right hand because the left hand is
considered to be “unclean”. Asking for two cards implies you will likely
lose one of them which is an insult.

Chapter 19: Selling to Multicultural Customers

4. It is acceptable to make notes about a multicultural customer:
C. On a separate note pad 
Writing on the customer’s card is equivalent to writing on their face!
Writing on your own card disrespects it as well.
5. A product demonstration with a Hispanic buyer is likely to be most
effective by:
B. Letting them try it for themselves 
Studies show that Hispanics tend to be more kinesthetic than other cul-
tures preferring to actually examine and operate products as opposed to
just hearing about its features.
6. When talking with new immigrant buyers who show no body lan-
guage which would be a definite buying sign?
C. Talking in their own language 
Smiling and laughing often indicated uneasiness or lack of understand-
ing and nodding often simply means they are listening, but not agreeing
with you.
7. Which gesture is most universally offensive?
A. Pointing with the finger 
Pointing with the finger is generally the most universally offensive ges-
ture. In most cultures outside the United States it is preferred that the
entire closed hand or a head nod be used to indicate a specific direction.
In many cultures the pointed finger is considered rude or even obscene.
8. Which group is mostly likely to openly display emotions during 
negotiations?
E. Middle Easterners 
Middle Easterners tend to be very emotional and emphatic as part of
their negotiating technique.
9. Which group is least likely to try to negotiate the price of your 
product?
A. Whites 
European Americans come from non-negotiating cultures where only
large purchases are regularly bargained on.
10. Which “thank you” gift would be least appropriate for Asians?
A. Watch 
Watches and clocks tend to remind Asians of the “winding down of life”
so giving a watch would be taken to mean “I wish you were dead”.
Probably not the sentiment you had in mind!

Busting Common Myths 
As an adult learner, you often have to unlearn before you’re ready to learn.
This is especially true when you’re building skills required to deal with cus-
tomers from other cultures. Your own culture is so ingrained that it has
become second nature, and assuming that everyone else thinks and acts the
same way is far too easy. 
So, before you begin your re-education, take some time de-educating yourself
by questioning some commonly held beliefs you may have picked up:
Myth: Minorities want to buy only from salespeople of their own culture.
Fact: This may be true for a few individuals, but not for most. People who
speak very little English often prefer communicating with someone who
speaks their language, but other than that, people generally don’t care
what your background is as long as you’re respectful, competent, and
sensitive to their traditions. In fact, many people prefer to work with a
salesperson from outside their own culture. Asians, for example, can be
very private about their financial affairs, and many are afraid that if they
work with a fellow Asian, she may disclose their income, debts, and 
303
Chapter 19: Selling to Multicultural Customers

purchases to others in the community. Newly immigrated Hispanics often
want to improve their English skills by interacting with people who won’t
speak Spanish to them.
Myth: We should treat everyone the same, regardless of culture.
Fact: Yes, it’s true that we should treat every customer fairly but this
does not necessarily mean treating them exactly the same way. For exam-
ple, if a buyer who is blind comes into your store or office, you wouldn’t
think of handing them a printed brochure to read. You may read the
brochure to the person or present the information in some other format.
In the same way, you have to adapt your sales presentation to meet the
needs of those from other countries and cultures.

Applying multicultural sales techniques
Lee’s clients often write to him to express their
appreciation for something they learned at one
of his seminars. One client in particular, a real
estate broker, had put Lee’s advice into practice
and was quite impressed with the results. 
A prospective client of Chinese descent invited
the broker and his wife over to his house for
dinner. The broker reviewed the notes from
Lee’s seminar prior to the dinner date and pre-
pared himself and his wife to expect to meet
more people than just the client. He knew that
other family members were likely to be in atten-
dance, so when he arrived to find 25 people
from three generations, he was not surprised.
He had also informed his wife that they wouldn’t
be talking business. They would simply treat this
as a social gathering and an opportunity to meet
some new friends. When they drove up, Cheng
(the prospective client and patriarch of the
family) came out to greet them personally and
lead them into the house. Before entering
Cheng’s home, the broker took off his shoes and
signaled his wife to do the same. He noticed that
everyone had left their shoes out by the porch.
The broker informed Cheng, as Lee had sug-
gested, that he was afraid he would say or do
something wrong that the family would find
offensive to his culture, and he asked Cheng to
assist him. Cheng sat the broker next to him at
the head of the table while the children sat on
little wooden stools.
Well into dinner, Cheng mentioned to the broker
that family is most important. He turned to the
broker and said, “One family for life,” and then
he smiled and said, “And one real estate broker
for life.” The broker replied, “And good friends
for life.” Cheng smiled broadly.
Cheng hired the broker to manage his family’s
properties, and it seemed as though everyone
in the family owned a rental property. He 
also asked the broker to represent him in com-
mercial and residential real estate investment
purchases. 
The broker managed to develop what he
believes is going to be a lifetime relationship
with Cheng and his family primarily because he
followed Lee’s advice and didn’t rush into a
business discussion. He showed respect for
Cheng’s culture and focused on the relationship
rather than what he could get out of it.

Myth: People should do as Americans do when they’re in this country.
Fact: People in other countries often refer to visitors from the United States
as “Ugly Americans.” Why? Because many tourists from the states fly to
Germany, France, China, or other foreign lands and expect the people
there to accommodate them. These less worldly tourists expect to receive
the same food and other amenities they are familiar with. They expect to
be served pizza in Asia and to speak English in France. Just as it’s difficult
for us Americans to leave our 200-year-old culture at the gate when we
travel abroad it’s even harder for those coming here from cultures that
are thousands of years old to do as we do here. While they do try to assimi-
late, it is hard for them. If you want a piece of business from the fastest-
growing segment of the retail market it is you who need to adjust . . . at
least a little. Take the time to learn about other cultures, languages, and
foods. As a bonus you will become a much more interesting person.
Myth: We don’t have that many minority customers so why should we
bother changing the way we do business?
Fact: You may be missing out on a huge opportunity. If you have few or
no minority customers the reason may be that you haven’t changed the
way you do business. Studies show that minorities go out of their way to
shop at establishments that are sensitive to their culture and meet their
unique needs. Go to the U.S. Census Web site at www.census.gov and
look at the percent of the population you serve who are non-white, and
ask yourself if you are getting your fair share of this business. It’s hard to
imagine any area of this country where you couldn’t boost your sales
with a substantial percentage of minorities.
Mastering the Multicultural 
Meet and Greet 
Even at family gatherings, people greet one another differently. Demonstrative
family members may offer a full-body hug, while the more self-conscious are
careful not to let any body parts below the ribcage come in contact. Others
may prefer shaking hands, offering a peck on the cheek, or simply fleeing to
another room until the customary pressing of flesh has ended.
Of course, in business situations with customers, you can usually get by with
a handshake, as I explain in Chapter 4. When dealing with customers from
other cultures, however, even the tried-and-true handshake comes into ques-
tion. What may seem like a friendly handshake to you, could make a customer
instantly uncomfortable, and in sales, that’s not exactly the emotion you’re
looking for.
305
Chapter 19: Selling to Multicultural Customers

In the following sections, I offer a strategy for handling the first meeting that
should work for every situation you’re in. I then reveal a few tips for dealing
with special circumstances, including meeting couples for the first time.
Following your customer’s lead
In the Unites States, we often assume that a firm handshake is universal, but
that’s simply a Western custom. The most common greeting in the world is
the bow, not the handshake. Joining hands can actually be offensive to
people who don’t believe in touching people they don’t know. 
To build rapport with any customer, regardless of culture, never assume you
know how they want to be greeted. To be safe, let them make the first move.
Hesitate a moment to see what they do, and then follow their lead. Most mul-
ticultural men in the United States have become used to our customs and are
not particularly bothered by shaking hands. They may even offer their hand,
knowing that this is the customary greeting. Asians may nod as they shake
hands. Simply do likewise.
Following a customer’s lead is fairly easy when the customer bows instead of
offering to shake your hand, but the first time a customer goes to hug you or
kiss you on the cheek, you’re likely to go into culture shock. This is especially
true if you’re a man meeting a male customer. In the United States, guys just
don’t do that. For many Hispanic and Middle Eastern men, however, a kiss on
the cheek is the preferred greeting. 
If a customer attempts to hug you, hug back. If he kisses you on the cheek,
return the gesture. Avoid acting offended; take it as a sign that the person is
comfortable with you. Most importantly, if a customer kisses you once on the
cheek, don’t try to turn away to avoid that second kiss, because it’s likely to
land squarely on your lips, which could be most uncomfortable for you and
your customer.
The rule of greeting people from outside the American culture is this: Never
assume anything. Greet your customer verbally, let your customer make the
first move, and then follow his lead. 
Gauging your customer’s personal space
You can’t see it, but surrounding your body and extending out for anywhere
from a few inches to several feet is an extension of your body commonly
referred to as your personal space. Your body immediately identifies anyone
306
Part V: Teaming Up with Your Customers . . . and Competitors 

crossing the border into that space as an intruder. Instinctively, your body
moves to constantly re-establish its comfort zone.
In the United States we shake hands and then stand about two-and-a-half feet
away from the other person. People from more formal countries, including
Japan, may bow or shake hands and then step back about four feet. At four
feet apart, you may feel as though you’re yelling across the Grand Canyon. To
close the gap, you step forward. Your Japanese customer steps back. If the
situation continues, you could end up chasing him around the store.
People from the Middle East and Spanish-speaking countries tend to stand
much closer than Americans are accustomed to. They may hug you and then
stand about six inches away, making you feel as though, at any minute, you’re
in for another hug. If you’re not ready for it, your natural impulse is to move
away, to establish your two-and-a-half-foot comfort zone. As soon as you do,
however, your customer feels as though you’re wandering off and inches
closer. If this keeps up, your customer may feel as though you don’t like him.
Let customers determine the personal space that’s comfortable for them. If
they step back after the greeting, get used to the distance and just speak a bit
more loudly to bridge the gap. If they step toward you after your greeting,
resist the temptation to back up, and be sure to have a breath mint handy.
Establishing eye contact . . . or not
When a customer in the United States looks away, you’re likely to think that
the person isn’t interested in what you have to say. The culture teaches that
establishing eye contact demonstrates interest and respect. 
Many groups, however, including the Vietnamese, Japanese, and Koreans,
avoid direct eye contact as a way of showing respect. To them, looking some-
one in the eye is intrusive and rude. To honor the other party, they look
down. Naturally, the uninformed salesperson does everything in her power 
to draw the person’s attention back to the conversation and may become vis-
ibly frustrated or even offended.
When a customer looks down, don’t automatically assume the person is not
interested, considers you unattractive, or doesn’t trust you. Just look down
and try to find something else your customer can look down at — the prod-
uct itself, product brochures, rate charts, flyers, or other material. 
Of course, not all cultures interpret eye contact or the lack of it the same way.
Middle Easterners and Hispanics, for example, may crave even more direct
eye contact than most Americans are used to. This can make the average
307
Chapter 19: Selling to Multicultural Customers

salesperson in the United States feel as though the customer is being con-
frontational. Feeling challenged, you may become a little too aggressive or
simply look away, and either move could jeopardize the sale. Simply adjust
your eye contact accordingly. Mirror your customer.
Keep reminding yourself that what your instincts are telling you is based on
cultural habit. It doesn’t mean what you think it means. Don’t trust the voice
inside your head that’s the product of decades of cultural training. Trust the
facts you know about other cultures to point you in the right direction.
Greeting the female companion
People of all cultures usually try to fit in, so don’t be surprised if a male cus-
tomer from another culture greets you with a handshake. If he’s accompanied
by a female companion, however, avoid the natural urge to shake her hand,
as well. After shaking the man’s hand, drop yours to your side, turn to the
female companion, and nod respectfully . . . unless, of course, she extends
her hand to greet you.
What’s acceptable for a man is not always acceptable for a woman in other
cultures. Many traditional Middle Eastern, Indian, and Japanese women, for
instance, are distressed by touching any male who is not their husband, often
because in their own country it is forbidden. If you turn to her with your
hand now at your side, and she does not extend hers, you know this to be the
case. Just politely nod in her direction to acknowledge her presence. This
simple act alone speaks volumes about your cultural sensitivity and your
willingness to accommodate her needs. 
Asking customers to explain their culture
When you meet up with someone from a culture you haven’t encountered
before, don’t feel as though you should already know everything about that
culture. Ask questions. If you don’t voice your thoughts, they start to pro-
duce cultural static — an energy field that interferes with communications. If
you’re secretly wondering about the way your customer is dressed or how
she acts or speaks or you have unspoken questions about their cultural or
religious practices, your customer is going to sense that. 
Ask questions in a non-threatening way. Chances are good that your cus-
tomer wants to talk about her culture to assist you in gaining understanding
and acceptance, and perhaps even talk about something that’s more interest-
ing than the weather. You’re likely to be very surprised at just how much you
can discover about other cultures as well as how people from other cultures
perceive your culture.
308
Part V: Teaming Up with Your Customers . . . and Competitors 

If you’re going to ask one customer about her culture, ask all of them, includ-
ing those who may not appear to be culturally different. You don’t want to
create the appearance of singling out anyone. 
Adjusting Your Sales Presentation 
for Cultural Differences
Salespeople often ask whether they need to adapt their sales presentation for
multicultural customers. Michael’s answer is always the same, “Only if you
want them to buy from you.” When you’re working on commissions, selling is
all about establishing relationships with your customers, and you can’t estab-
lish solid relationships if you’re not communicating in a way that your cus-
tomers can clearly understand.
309
Chapter 19: Selling to Multicultural Customers
Tweaking presentations for different cultures
Salespeople from a wide variety of industries
attend Lee’s seminars to discover techniques
for tapping the multicultural market for sales
opportunities. One attendee, an insurance
salesperson, discovered that she could sell
better to different ethnic groups simply by
adjusting her presentation.
One important lesson she took away from the
seminar was that multicultural customers didn’t
necessarily want to buy from an agent from
their own culture. This simple truth gave her the
motivation to reach out to customers of differ-
ent races and cultures. 
First, she began reaching out to African
American clients, because Lee had mentioned
that only 32 percent of them had life insurance
while 92 percent believed that life insurance
was essential. She started taking more time
with these prospects because of their historic
mistrust of insurance companies. She got to
know them as people, helped educate them
about the various life insurance options, and let
them get to know her as a person, which helped
build trust. It took longer than usual but it was
worth it. 
With Asians, she remembered that Lee had
advised to avoid talking about death, because
Asians generally believe that discussions of death
could bring bad luck. Instead, she emphasized the
protection that insurance provides for families
now and in the future. There was much less resis-
tance to discussing this aspect of insurance than
when she focused on the death benefit.
With Hispanics, she highlighted the savings fea-
ture of whole-life policies, which people from
this background seemed to value most. They
seemed to consider the death benefit almost as
an added bonus.
I encourage you to take Lee’s advice and make
the modifications necessary to your sales tech-
niques and presentations make yourself more
appealing to these un-served and under-served
groups. In addition to boosting sales, you can
open your mind and your life to a host of new
insights and experiences.

In the following sections, I offer some suggestions for redecorating your
office, choosing effective media, and guiding multicultural customers through
a purchase process that may be even more complicated for them than it is
for your other customers.
Changing your office décor
Many salespeople try to impress prospective customers by hanging sales
awards on the walls of their office. Although your sales achievements may
impress customers who come from highly competitive cultures, people from
other cultures may find them much less remarkable. Diplomas, certifications,
and family photos often carry much more weight. They show that you’re a
well-informed individual who values relationships.
Choosing effective presentation media
Educators often discuss different learning styles. One student may be more of
a visual learner, who needs to see things in order to comprehend the lesson.
Another student may learn more effectively in lecture or by having a tutor
explain it. Other students may be experiential, hands-on learners.
You can observe these same tendencies in different cultures. In general,
Asians are more visual learners. After all, their written language essentially
consists of pictures. Hispanics are generally more tactile learners — they
want to see a product and perhaps even try it out. African Americans are typ-
ically more comfortable processing spoken language. 
By knowing that people of other cultures may be able to process information
more effectively when it’s presented in a certain medium, you can prepare a
presentation that makes effective use of all media. If you sense that a cus-
tomer requires more visuals, you can present photos or illustrations or even
videos. If another customer needs to see the product in action, demonstrat-
ing the product or letting the customer try it out may be more effective.
Speaking the language
Unless you’re bilingual or multilingual, you’re likely to find yourself struggling
to communicate with some potential customers. In some cases, the language
barrier may be a hurdle you can’t clear. If the customer can speak a little
310
Part V: Teaming Up with Your Customers . . . and Competitors 

English, however, you may be able to work around the obstacles together.
The following tips offer some additional assistance: 
 Speak a little more slowly, but not so slowly that your tone seems 
condescending.
 Streamline your presentation to explain only the most important fea-
tures and benefits of your product. Don’t overwhelm your customer
with details.
 Enunciate your words clearly. 
 Don’t shout. Your customer’s understanding doesn’t increase in propor-
tion to the volume level.
 Choose the most basic words possible and avoid technical jargon.
 Avoid using idiomatic expressions, such as “We’ll cross that bridge when
we come to it.”
 If your customer doesn’t seem to understand you, try explaining what
you just said another way. A different choice of words might work better
or try a different teaching style. 
 If you don’t understand the person, accept the blame for your inability
to understand. Rather than saying, “Could you repeat that? I can’t under-
stand you,” consider saying something like, “I’m sorry, I’m having trou-
ble understanding you. Could you please repeat that for me?” 
Leading customers through 
the purchase process
When selling to people from other cultures, expect to spend more time and
effort educating the customer. Although most of your customers, those who
grew up in the country, probably understand the basics of buying a car, a
house, or whatever it is you’re selling and have a general idea of what con-
tracts are all about, a customer from another country may need a brief
primer. The more complex the transaction, the more you can expect to invest
in education.
Cultivate patience, not condescension. You don’t want to sound as if you’re
talking to a first grader. As you speak, you can illustrate your point with pic-
tures or diagrams. Many immigrants are unfamiliar with products and serv-
ices that Americans take for granted. Slowly step them through the purchase
process, unless they have some level familiarity with it.

Chapter 19: Selling to Multicultural Customers

Haggling with Multicultural Buyers
The world can be divided into two types of countries — hagglers and non-
hagglers, negotiators and non-negotiators. In non-negotiating countries,
including the United States, Germany, and Great Britain, money is relatively
plentiful and time is scarce. To save time, most people in these countries are
willing to pay sticker price, rather than haggle to save a few bucks. The
exception to the rule is when people are buying big-ticket items, such as
homes or cars. Then, they force themselves to haggle, but most people don’t
enjoy it.
In negotiating countries, people barter for everything, because time has 
traditionally been plentiful and money scarce. Saving a few dollars on meat or
vegetables could place more food on the table. As a result of the constant
practice, people from these countries are really good at haggling, so I recom-
mend that you hone your own haggling skills. Check out Negotiating For
Dummies by Michael C. Donaldson and David Frohnmayer.
In the following sections, I point out a couple key areas of negotiating that
apply specifically to situations in which you need to negotiate with people
from other cultures.
Surviving your first group negotiation
In some countries, sometimes referred to as “collectivist countries,” shop-
ping is a team sport. An entire family or village is likely to show up to check
out what the local merchant is selling and decide as a group, whether to buy
the product. When these folks move to the United States, they may bring this
style of shopping with them.
Highly collectivist countries include Pakistan, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru,
Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, and China. The United States, Australia, Great
Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand are highly individualistic
countries. 
When you’re confronted with a group of collectivist shoppers, the real trick is
to figure out who is really making the purchase decision. Sometimes, it’s not
so easy. It may not even be the person who is actually going to take out his
wallet and pay for your product. I’ve seen cases in which the grandparent or
even a teenager is the ultimate decision-maker. Your best option in such
cases is to deliver your sales presentation to the entire group, treating them
all as equals. 
312
Part V: Teaming Up with Your Customers . . . and Competitors 

You can spot the decision-maker at the very end when you ask your closing
question, “Would you like to take this home today?” Everyone in the group
looks to the decision-maker, and now you finally know the person to whom
you were selling.
Negotiating before, during, and after 
the signing of the contract
In the United States, once the ink dries on the contract, the deal is done . . .
you can stick a fork in it. People from other countries often don’t see it that
way. They may continue to negotiate after signing a contract. Michael con-
stantly hears complaints from salespeople about how “unethical” certain
groups of buyers appear to be, because they don’t seem to grasp the concept
of a contract. The truth is that they view contracts a little differently.
In the United States, bargaining stops when everyone signs on the dotted
lines. In countries like China, however, signing a purchase agreement is
simply proof that the parties have decided to negotiate — price, terms, and
conditions, are all open to negotiation. These people are not being unethical;
they just have a different approach to contractual relationships. 
Whenever you’re dealing with strong negotiators, regardless of culture,
always save something for the end. If you sign a contract that’s truly based
on your “best offer,” you leave yourself with little to negotiate later, which is
likely to cause some bad feelings. Hold off on offering that extended warranty
or free installation until the product has been delivered.
Adjusting Customer Service 
for Different Cultures
Customer service is a universal language. No matter where your customer is
from and which language she speaks, she wants to be treated fairly and with
respect. The differences in how people from different cultures deal with poor
customer service are expressed in how the people react to receiving poor
customer service.
In the United States, people are trained to complain. They contact customer
service, and if customer service resolves the problem, the customer typically
forgives and forgets. Only after several unsuccessful attempts at obtaining
313
Chapter 19: Selling to Multicultural Customers

satisfaction is the customer likely to become bitter and start complaining
about the company to family and friends, and perhaps even complete
strangers.
When dealing with customers from other cultures, you’re likely to hear less
complaining. Disappointed with your product or customer service, the
person is likely to go elsewhere in the future. Even worse, the customer is
more likely than someone from the United States to speak badly of your com-
pany and products to their friends and family members.
Because you’re not likely to hear complaints from your multicultural cus-
tomers, being proactive is the best option:
 Pay more attention to your customer’s body language than what she
says. A facial expression showing dissatisfaction or confusion may say
more than you’re likely to hear.
 Address any issues earlier rather than later. If possible, address any con-
cerns before the customer steps out that door. You may not have
another chance.
 Ask a few trusted minority customers what you could do to better serve
customers from their community or describe an interaction you had and
ask them for a critique.
Working with customers from other cultures may take more time and effort,
but most salespeople find it very rewarding. When you satisfy customers
from other cultures, they’re much more likely to remain loyal and refer others
in their community to you. Because they’re coming to you from a referral,
they’re much more ready to buy. Take the effort to learn about every cus-
tomer’s background and you’ll be rewarded not only with increased sales, but
also with fascinating facts about the world. And you won’t lose one piece of
luggage on an airplane!

In This Chapter

 Sending your worst customers to your competitors
 Building synergies with the competition
T
empting as it is to criticize and drive a wedge between yourself and your
competitor, this is often counterproductive. Follow the adage, “Keep your
friends close and your enemies closer.” Spend less time criticizing your com-
petitor and more time studying the competition and exploring ways to take
advantage of what they have to offer. 
What are your competitors doing that you should be doing? What could they
do better? Are there any opportunities for you to work together? Do you have
any customers who would work better with one of your competitors? By
playing fair and working with your competition in addition to working against
them, you can often reap unparalleled rewards.
In this chapter, I point out some of the benefits of playing nice with the com-
petition and offer suggestions on how to leverage cooperation to give your-
self a competitive edge.
Seeing the Upside of Letting 
Down Your Guard
I’m fiercely competitive and usually want to squash anyone who goes head-
to-head with me. That’s one reason why I send someone else in the office to
do my bidding at foreclosure auctions. I get so caught up in the bidding war,

so obsessed with preventing someone else from buying a property I want,
that I bid myself out of what would otherwise have been a profitable invest-
ment. I end up paying way too much, so when I try to sell it, I can’t turn a
profit.
Most top salespeople I know are the same way, but this type of over-
competitive nature is counterproductive. It slams shut and locks the doors 
to information and relationships the can be very valuable in protecting your
interests, generating new business, and opening future opportunities and
even potential partnerships.
By being overly competitive, you may be missing out on the following benefits:
 Getting free advice: Talking shop, telling stories of success and failure,
and trading information (to some degree) enables everyone in the indus-
try to climb one rung up on the ladder of success. This is part of what
trade associations are all about. You don’t have to give up closely guarded
company secrets, but by sharing a little information, you and your com-
petitor can both achieve more.
 Offering complementary products and services: You and your com-
petitor may not be offering exactly the same products and services. If
that’s the case, you can often share customers, recommending your com-
petitor for products and services you don’t offer and having your com-
petitor recommend you for products and services she doesn’t offer.
 Picking up the slack for one another: When you can’t possibly fill an
order, rather than disappointing your customers, you can purchase mer-
chandise from your competitor to cover the shortfall. Your competitor
may need to return the favor someday by purchasing products from you.
You may even be able to share leads if you or your competitor can’t
handle a huge new influx of customers.
 Referring clients to one another: A client who gives you trouble may be
perfect for one of your competitors and vice versa. In my business, for
example, some home sellers find me too aggressive, so I may refer them
to someone who’s less aggressive. By referring customers who aren’t
right for you to your competitors, you create a win-win-win scenario —
you, your ex-client, and your competitor all win out. In some industries,
you may even be able to charge a referral fee. See “Referring Customers
to Your Competitors and Affiliates,” later in this chapter, for details.
 Warning one another about challenging customers: Customers, espe-
cially the most challenging ones, often play hopscotch, skipping from
one salesperson to the next to find the perfect fit. By communicating
openly with your competitors, you may be able to create an informal
dossier on these folks and warn one another of specific problems to
316
Part V: Teaming Up with Your Customers . . . and Competitors 

watch out for. You may find out that the customer has a history of not
paying, for example, which could enable you to be more proactive about
receiving payment.
 Watching one another’s backs: If you have a customer or former
employee posting negative comments about you on the Internet or an
employee who’s acting unethically, you want to know about it. By having
a close, cordial relationship with your competitors, you’re much more
likely to hear about something than if you remain isolated.
 Attracting customers . . . together: When attending industry events, stick
close to the competition. This gives your customers the convenience of
one-stop-shopping for the products and services they need. This is the
whole idea behind consumer shows. The key is to have the best people
running your booth — high-energy people with integrity, who make your
business stand head and shoulders above the competition.
 Cutting in on one another’s profits: By remaining close with your com-
petition, you may lose some clients, but you also gain an opportunity to
win more clients. Free and open competition works best when clients
have a choice. You just need to prove that you’re better.
 Making your company a more attractive investment opportunity:
Competing companies often merge to generate increased revenue and
cut costs. By remaining friendly with the competition, you make your
company a more attractive target and you discover more about your
competitor, so your company can make a well-informed decision of
whether to move ahead with a merger.
Successful businesses don’t isolate themselves by walling out competitors.
They expand by walling them in — embracing and encompassing the compe-
tition. Never let your highly competitive nature get in the way of making money.
Without competition, you become complacent and stagnant. Competition
produces healthy accelerants to fire us ahead of the pack and improve every-
one’s performance and bottom line. 
Studying Your Competitors
I always say “Hind side is 20/20.” If you’re getting your hind side kicked by
the competition, you have 20/20 vision on what you need to do to remedy the
problem — just study the competition. 
As I explain later, you never simply want to mimic the competition. Doing 
so simply makes you equal at best. You want to be superior. Keeping your
317
Chapter 20: Playing Nice with the Competition

competition in sight is important, but make sure you’re looking at them
through your rearview mirror. Your competition can open your mind to new
ideas, but don’t get overly obsessed with them. Set your sights on what you
know you have to do to be number one.
In the following sections, I lead you through the process of identifying the
competition, and then I offer some suggestions on how to do a little corpo-
rate espionage. 
Never badmouth your competition, no matter how tempting that may be. It
only reflects poorly on you. If a customer points out something good about
one of your competitors, acknowledge it. Once you know what the customer
needs, you have an opportunity to point out what your company offers that
your competitors don’t. Remain positive.
Identifying your competitors
I was talking to a fellow who ran a chain of movie theaters. I asked him about
the competition. According to him, his competition was everything that pulled
a dollar out of the pockets of prospective patrons. He wasn’t in competition
simply with other movie theaters. He saw himself in competition with local
bars, video arcades, bowling alleys, miniature golf courses, movie rental busi-
nesses, casinos online and off, online movie rental businesses, television,
televised sports, and on and on.
He was right.
The moral of the story is that your competitor may not always be obvious. 
It may not be someone in the same industry. Your competitor is anyone or
anything that your customer is paying for with money that you should be get-
ting. In fact, some of your stiffest competition is likely to come from busi-
nesses you’re completely unaware of. It’s like being on a highway driving 80
miles an hour thinking nobody is going to pass you when someone zips
around you going 90. You wonder, “Where the heck did she come from?”
Don’t let this happen to you. Think of all the unforeseen competitors lurking
in all the corners.
To identify your competition, ask yourself the following questions:
 Who are my direct competitors in the industry?
 Who’s behind me? Who has their sights on me?
 What else do my customers spend their money on?
318
Part V: Teaming Up with Your Customers . . . and Competitors 

 Are any new technologies on the horizon that could threaten my 
business?
 Are there any changes to the market or the industry that are likely to
affect my bottom line — either positively or negatively?
The competition is anyone or anything that draws your customers’ cash out-
lays away from you. 
Scoping out the competition
Before I became the spokesperson for Guthy-Renker Home, an Internet lead-
generation service for the real estate industry, one of the first things I did was
visit the Web site of every company that competes with Guthy-Renker Home.
I signed up for their services, downloaded all of their promotional materials,
poked around on their Web sites, and gathered all the information I possibly
could. I wanted to know why Guthy-Renker Home was superior, so I could tell
prospective customers of Guthy-Renker Home when they asked me.
As a salesperson, you need to know first that your company, products, serv-
ices, and you are superior. Then, you need to know what it is that makes you
superior. And the only way to do that is by researching the competition:
 Visit your competitors’ Web sites and blogs. If they feature newsletters,
discussion forums, a mailing list, brochures, or anything else, register to
receive it.
 Talk to your customers. Ask your customers if they’ve done business
with a particular competitor and what the experience was like. If the
customer only considered doing business with the competitor, ask why
she ultimately chose you, instead.
 Talk to your competitors’ customers, if possible. If a customer chooses
your competitor over you, find out why. What did your competitor offer
that you didn’t?
 Attend the awards banquet for your industry and seek out the top
players in your field. Their exemplary careers serve as inspiration in
your own growing business. After all, they started in this business in the
same manner you did. After the awards, drop by the winner’s circle and
strike up a conversation. On their special night, your competitor will be
happy to receive congratulatory accolades. Ask questions, and you will
receive golden nuggets of information. Use what you gather to fuel your
own personal drive to success.
319
Chapter 20: Playing Nice with the Competition

 Study your competition’s advertising campaigns. Approach their mar-
keting as though you were a prospective customer rather than a com-
petitor. What catches your attention? Do they offer something different
from what you offer or simply offer the same thing in a different way? Is
their area of expertise different yet related to your field? Perhaps you
can change your marketing to draw on your strengths and their weak-
nesses without openly criticizing the competitor. If the competition is
missing a particular aspect to their campaign, is there a reason for it?
Perhaps that missing aspect is not profitable. If it is feasible, yet they
have overlooked its potential, change your own marketing strategies to
include what they’re missing.
When you’re scoping out the competition, search for lessons to be learned.
Ask yourself the following questions:
 Why did past competitors who failed go extinct? What did they do
wrong that I should never, ever repeat?
 What does the competition do right and what does my competition do
wrong that affects their income?
 Are there any “add-ons” I can create to liven up my revenue strategies? 
When comparing what you offer to what your competitors offer, be brutally
honest. If your competition is better than you, admit it, and then get down to
the business of fixing what’s wrong. I’ve talked with many salespeople and
business owners who merely criticize the competition so they can feel good
about themselves. This only blinds you to what you really need to do.
Avoiding the Copy Cat Syndrome
When I tell you to check out the competition and find out what it’s up to, I’m
not suggesting that you become a “me too” salesperson. Researching the
competition merely enables you to see what the competition is doing and
hopefully give you insight into why your competitors may or may not be
achieving greater levels of success.
Trying to confuse the market or merely mimic the competition usually results
in becoming a cheap copy of the original. You may win over a few confused
customers, but you won’t gain any respect in the industry, and you certainly
can never hope to take on a leadership role with such an approach.
In the following sections, I show you how to keep an eye on what’s important,
develop a creative vision, and become an early adopter, so you can gain an
edge over your competition.
320
Part V: Teaming Up with Your Customers . . . and Competitors 

As fast as the world changes, you can no longer succeed by playing follow
the leader. You need to develop your own vision and either work harder to
eventually catch up and take the lead or work smarter to find a shortcut that
puts you in the lead.
Focusing on your business
Copy cat corporations often fail to realize that they don’t have the same
structure and personnel as their competitors. They’re ill-equipped to do what
the competition does, because they don’t have identical people and resources.
Focus on your business, on the unique talent and resources you have at your
disposal. Don’t try to be something you’re not.
When deciding on a direction to take, first ask yourself what you have that
the competition doesn’t. Then, explore various ways to leverage the unique
skills and talents of your staff and other resources you have at your disposal
to maximize results.
In your quest to become the leader, never lose site of your customer. Your
customer’s needs should influence every decision you make.
Sparking creativity
Incremental progress is okay in some cases, but when you’re shooting to gain
a few steps in the market, you often have to take a creative leap. Staring long-
ingly at the competition usually doesn’t do it. You have to immerse yourself
in a creative atmosphere and give your brain license to play. Here are some
suggestions for building an atmosphere that’s more conducive to creativity:
 Surround yourself with creative people. Gather a roomful of creative
people, grab a whiteboard, and get to work. Toss around ideas on where
to find new customers, how to more effectively market your products
and services, and how to serve your clients better. Two or three or four
heads are often better than one.
 Surround yourself with stuff. Ideas don’t pop out of a vacuum. They
usually arise when two or more things come together. Think of an 
innovation, and you often find the juxtaposition of two great things —
“satellite” and “TV,” “video” and “game,” “Internet” and “marketing,”
“online” and “lead-generation,” “chocolate” and “peanut butter.” The
more you have floating around in your head, the more connections you
can make.
321
Chapter 20: Playing Nice with the Competition

 Stop thinking. Your mind needs time and space to freely make connec-
tions on its own. Give yourself some quiet time. Spend time with your
family or alone. Relax. Let your mind sort things out on its own.
 Identify your creative time. Are you most creative first thing in the
morning, later in the afternoon, or late at night? Note when you’re most
creative and block that off as your creative time. Some people, like my
assistant, Lois, go to bed with a problem and wake up with the perfect
solution. Lois used to wake up her husband in the middle of the night
and ask him to remember her ideas, but then he bought her a leather-
bound notebook and pen to keep on the nightstand, so he could get
some sleep.
 Play a game of free association. Some of my best creativity comes when
I first wake up in the morning. The phones aren’t ringing, the world is
still asleep, and I can concentrate with a rested and cleared mind. Sit
quietly and think of your particular obstacle and freely associate ideas.
Do not allow interruptions. Often, the answer will come. After all, nobody
knows all the details involved in a particular situation than you.
Keep an idea book with you at all times. I can almost guarantee that unless
you jot down your ideas, you are going to forget more than 90 percent of
them. Write down every idea you have, no matter how crazy or unrealistic it
may seem, and then read through your ideas every few weeks. You may be
surprised at just how many of them really do have legs.
Launching ideas into action
The difference between success and failure is often in the execution. Second-
rate sales people often have big ideas, great ideas that ultimately turn not into
great plans and brilliant accomplishments but into deep regrets — shoulda,
coulda, woulda . . . didn’t. Once you think of some fabulous new idea, move it
from the boardroom to the drawing room and then on to the launch pad: 
 Put together a plan of action. Once you have these exciting new ideas
for increasing business, write them down with specific goals in mind and
what to expect from each stage of implementation. Put time limits, goals,
and expectations into place. Then, stick with it. See Chapter 3 for details
about setting goals and planning.
 Admit the weak points in yourself and your plan. This is a healthy
exercise and has great advantages for your career. If you shy away from
acknowledging the weaknesses in your business, you can’t solve the
issue. Recognize your weaknesses and then work (or delegate) your way
around them.
 Accountability is a must: Without written accountability to measure
your new plans, you will fail. Hold to your original plan of action and
make the necessary adjustments along the way.
322
Part V: Teaming Up with Your Customers . . . and Competitors 

Playing nice with competition is fine, but keep your new plans to yourself.
Gaining a gadget edge
As soon as any new technology hits the streets, I gotta have it. Everyone
around me thinks I’m just fascinated by gadgets and toys, and they may be
right, but I like to think of my obsession with having the latest, greatest gear a
savvy way of staying one step ahead of the competition.
Sure, when something first comes out, you pay more for it, and it may be
slower, less reliable, and buggier than future versions, but by being the first
one on the block with the latest technology, you rake in a host of benefits:
 Potential to gain an edge on the competition — because technology has
a shelf life of about three minutes your competition may just be getting
up to speed on the new technology while you’re upgrading to the latest
version
 More time to experiment with and master the new technology before it
becomes mainstream
 More time to implement the new technology in your business model
 Pioneer plugs — the distinct advantages you have to market yourself as
the very first in your field to offer the benefits of the new technology
 The time to think up creative new ideas and applications for the new
technology, so you can start the bandwagon before anyone else has a
chance to jump on it
 The opportunity to establish yourself as the voice of authority on a new
technology or system
If you don’t pioneer new gadgets as tools for your business, be assured, your
competition or someone else will. 
For additional tips on the types of technology that can be most useful to you
as a salesperson, check out Chapter 12.
Referring Customers to Your 
Competitors and Affiliates
Although you can certainly generate gobs of business with the right market-
ing and advertising, that’s usually fairly costly in terms of time, money, and
effort. An easier and often free alternative is to focus on referrals, but you
323
Chapter 20: Playing Nice with the Competition

have to handle these referrals strategically. Your goal? Get rid of your worst
customers and replace them with better customers.
In the following sections, I show you how to deliver this one-two punch by
sending your worst customers to your competitors and teaming up with affili-
ates to generate business for yourself and your affiliates.
Redirecting your worst customers 
to the competition
Whenever I tell the salespeople I coach to send their worst customers to the
competition, I always get a chuckle. They think I’m telling them to make their
competitors suffer by sending bad customers their way. Although that’s cer-
tainly part of it, a bigger reason to do it is to create a win-win-win situation
for everyone involved:
 You get rid of a customer who was demanding too much time and
energy. In certain industries, you may have the additional benefit of
charging your competitor a finder’s fee for the new client.
 Your ex-customer has the opportunity to start fresh, hopefully with a
salesperson who’s a better fit.
 Your competitor obtains a new customer and may be more open to refer-
ring customers to you.
When a customer isn’t working out for you, fire them, but let them down easy.
Tell them that you’d love to continue working with them, but so-and-so would
probably be a better match. Take the blame for the relationship not working
out. The old “It’s not you, it’s me . . .” line works wonders.
Sending business to your affiliates
Most salespeople are well aware that they need to give referrals to get refer-
rals, but many salespeople handle the referral process all wrong. They end
up losing control and losing out on opportunities to maximize the actual
number of referrals they receive. When giving referrals, be aware of the
wrong way and the right way to do it:
 Wrong way: Say you’re selling cars. A customer comes in to buy a car
and mentions that she gets her auto insurance from XYZ Insurance, Inc.
You ask how much she’s paying and then mention that she may want to
324
Part V: Teaming Up with Your Customers . . . and Competitors 

get a second opinion from ABC Insurance, Inc., a company you know of
in town. This referral is not going to expand your business.
 Right way: Same scenario — you’re selling a car, and the customer men-
tions her insurance company. You realize that this is certainly a reputable
company. You ask your customer if she has the name and contact infor-
mation of the person she deals with at the insurance company. You call
the insurance agent, introduce yourself, tell the person you have met
one of his clients, say that you would like to offer your services to him in
the future, and tell him that you would appreciate it if he would send his
clients your way, as well. You now have a new source for referrals.
Partnering with Your Competitors 
to Create Win-Win Opportunities
Going head-to-head with the competition isn’t always the best move, espe-
cially if your competitor has a harder head. I’ve seen companies nearly
destroy each other in all-out war, when it wasn’t really necessary. The compa-
nies perceived each other as competitors, but they were actually offering
something quite different. Some competing companies continue to battle it
out even though both of them could become more profitable by cooperating.
In the following sections, I offer some guidance on how to team up with your
competition to create win-win opportunities.
Harnessing the power of affiliates 
and competitors
Throughout the book, particularly in Chapters 7 and 14, I show you how to
network with colleagues and other “friendly” business associates, but you
can network productively with foes, as well. When you need to expand sales,
you usually need to expand your human resources, so start recruiting the top
talent, wherever it may be:
 Find talented affiliates and competitors: The first key is to get out there
and talk with anyone related to your type of business. Don’t worry if
they are your competition. Get the word out that you are looking for tal-
ented individuals. Think of the advantages of spreading the workload
with more talent on your team — more ideas and more energy. A team
325
Chapter 20: Playing Nice with the Competition

can accomplish far more than one player can ever hope to accomplish
on her own.
 Fill your voids with the talents of others: When you’re missing the
inner resources to accomplish a particular goal, find someone in posses-
sion of the skills or talents you’re missing. Your weaknesses could be
their strengths. Find the talent. Then let them fly. Let them get fired up
and bring plans that can intertwine with yours. For more about finding
the right people to fill the gaps, check out Chapter 13.
Whenever you spot a business that, at first glance, seems to be competing
against you, ask yourself whether that business is a true competitor. Are they
selling exactly what you’re selling or something slightly different? If another
business can offer your customers a product or service that your customers
may need, consider promoting the other business as an affiliate. You may
even be able to charge them a fee for referrals or obtain referrals in
exchange.
326

Collective marketing
Fierce competitors don’t always play rough.
Lending institutions, for example, often compete
for clientele, but they’ve been known to join
forces at times to the mutual benefit of all
involved. I’ve witnessed these collaborative
marketing efforts unfold particularly when lend-
ing institutions are trying to get referrals from
new home builders.
Lenders know that if they can make one builder
happy, they stand to reap the benefits of many
mortgage loans as builders refer prospective
buyers to lenders for financing. They also know
that if the builder’s representative can rely on
them for steady service, the representative is
going to recommend that lender to every poten-
tial customer that walks in the builder’s model
home. On the lender’s behalf, the builder’s rep-
resentative delivers a mini-commercial to each
and every customer. It is a perfect marriage
because the builder and sales representative
want smooth transactions and no hassles, while
the lending institutions gather lots of loans and
new clientele.
How does a lending institution get to all these
builders? Marching around to each and every
builder could be brutal. However, if they could
find a place where builder’s congregate, imag-
ine what they could accomplish in that single
room full of builders. And that’s exactly what
they do. They host wine and cheese parties and
informative gatherings for builders at the build-
ing association levels and ingratiate themselves
with that world. It’s big business and it works.
The building association is thrilled to offer inter-
esting opportunities to their builders, and the
lending institutions can pitch their products and
services to the entire group at once. Everybody
wins. Everybody prospers.

Consider selling for the competition. If your competitor is selling something
that many of your customers want, why not offer it as an option? I realize that
this is not always an option, it depends on what you and your competitors
sell, but it is an option in some cases, as I point out in the following sidebar,
“Teaming up with the competition.”
Your focus should be on pleasing your customer. If that means referring your
customer to the competition, that may be the best decision for your long-
term success. News of your commitment to your customer’s success and
happiness travels fast and is sure to draw customers in your direction.
Bridge burning creates tiny towns
I learned a long time ago never to create enemies along the way, especially
with the competition. Inevitably, you will run into the same people time and
time again. Just when you need the support to make a deal fly, you run into
the old toad you told off in 1963!
Secretary saves the day! Fifteen years ago, I had a competitor friend who hap-
pened to have a fabulous assistant. She offered to help me with one of my
deals and botched it up terribly. For the sake of the relationship with my
competitor, I worked with her to correct the issues and consummate the deal.
I always treated her with great respect, despite the mistakes.

Chapter 20: Playing Nice with the Competition
Teaming up with the competition
For many years, I realized that I was competing
against new home builders — what we real
estate agents refer to as new construction.
When I’m trying to sell “used” homes to first-
time buyers, these builders were offering homes
in pristine condition. I managed to out-compete
them in many cases by pointing out the value of
an established home — affordability, no waiting
for the home to be built, the mature landscape,
and so on.
Later, I realized that I could sell new homes, 
too! I contacted the builders in the area and
worked out a deal in which if I delivered buyers,
I would receive a commission. This increased
business for me in two ways — I had more
homes to sell, and I could offer buyers more
options.

Years later, I needed a fundraiser chairman and didn’t know where to find
one. During this dilemma, one of my affiliates arrived for a meeting we had
previously arranged. Who do you think he had with him? A new assistant!
Yes, it was the same girl from years ago. As it turns out, she loved raising
money for causes and remembered my kindness. She raised over $36,000 for
the cause I was supporting.
328
Part V: Teaming Up with Your Customers . . . and Competitors 
Cutthroat competition: Is it worth it?
I recently ran into the son of a man I once knew.
Chip Jenkins was the son of Mr. Pete Jenkins,
whom I always knew simply as “Mr. Jenkins.”
Mr. Jenkins was a great salesperson and a suc-
cessful businessman, but he had no personal
life or close friends. Chip told me that his father
was still alive, but he hadn’t seen his father in
over five years. His father had never met his
grandchildren.
Mr. Jenkins’ family had owned strawberry fields
in California. He eventually sold the fields and
purchased a shopping center in Michigan. The
department of transportation needed the land
for road improvements, so they were forced 
to pay him millions of dollars for the shopping
center because of all the improvements to 
the land. 
He used part of his small fortune to invest in
building condominiums, and he hired me to sell
them. One of the buyers I found had recently
lost her husband. She said she just wanted to
sell her home and buy a condo, and she gave
me a $30,000 deposit. A few days later, she
came back to me and explained that she had
made a rash decision and wanted to stay in her
house for a year to sort things out. This was a
wise choice. Whenever you lose a spouse, you
really should wait a year before making any
major decisions.
I went to Mr. Jenkins and told him that we
needed to refund the widow’s deposit. He
refused, we argued, and he fired me, refusing to
pay me the commissions I had earned. I ended
up paying thousands of dollars in legal fees to
force him to pay me the commissions I had
earned.
When I heard from Chip that he had not seen his
father for five years and that his father had never
seen his own grandchildren, I was not surprised.
The way Mr. Jenkins handled business was the
way he navigated life in general — it was his
way or the highway. 
The point of all this is that life is short. Compete to
the point of winning, but never to the point of iso-
lating yourself from the rest of humanity. Play fair,
do the right thing, and you are going to have more
business and more profit than you ever expected.

E
ach and every For Dummies book you pick up
includes a Part of Tens, with at least a couple chap-
ters packed with tips, tricks, and other bit-sized tidbits
that you can munch on whenever you have a few minutes
to spare and need a little brain food.
In this Part of Tens, I reveal my top ten power selling tac-
tics and techniques, recommend ten ways to break a sales
slump (or avoid a slump from ever occurring), and tell
you ten stories of awesome salespeople who can inspire
you to overcome whatever obstacles you may think are
keeping you from achieving your dreams.

and Techniques 
In This Chapter
 Building relationships for long-term sales success
 Producing positive buzz on the streets
 Keeping focused on the end result
 Avoiding the temptation to job hop
 Putting your ideas in action
I
’m not a big fan of canned sales pitches, but I do rely on a toolbox packed
with strategies, techniques, and tips to place prospective clients at ease
and make them more receptive to my presentation. 
In the following sections, I share my ten most effective methods, but remem-
ber to personalize these methods for your own use. You don’t want to look
and sound like some other sales rep who just met with these same clients.
Focusing on Relationships, Not Sales
Do you know anyone who calls you only when they need something from
you? Chances are good that you know more than one person like this, and
they probably make you a little uncomfortable or even bitter. You probably
avoid them. You may even screen their calls.
Customers and clients are the same way with salespeople, because sales-
people usually call when they want something, when they want the customer
to buy something. This is why building relationships is so important.

Chapters 14 and 18 offer plenty of ideas for how to build mutually beneficial
relationships with customers, but here are a couple more:
 Develop and implement a customer relationship program, in which you
are in regular contact with customers without selling them anything. This
should include regular phone calls, e-mail messages, newsletters, and a
blog that they can visit at their leisure. 
 Arrange business development meetings with existing, past, and
prospective clients on a regular basis.
 Conduct focused seminars and workshops of interest for your target
markets.
 Arrange speaking engagements with your target market’s industry and
professional organizations.
 Network, network, network!
Generating Positive Publicity 
for You and Your Company
In addition to targeting prospective customers, become a high-profile target
by generating positive publicity for yourself and your company:
 Create at least one blog for your business.
 Create at least one community-based blog to support your community.
 Write articles for professional and trade publications on current topics
of interest to your target markets.
 Publish and distribute a press release on a regular basis announcing
something important and of current interest.
 Get involved in the communities in which you work and live. Give, 
give, give.
Implementing an Hour of Power
In Chapter 12, I talk about my Hour of Power — an hour I set aside every day
of the week to place 100 phone calls to people in my address book just to
keep in touch. Here’s how you do it:
332
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

1. Pick a group of 100 people in your address book you want to contact.
The group may consist of people in a volunteer organization in which
you participate, customers you service, or colleagues.
2. Think of something clever to say that is unrelated to selling. Do not
sell on these calls. Simply establish contact and let the person know you
are thinking about her.
3. Let everyone in the office know that your Hour of Power is about to
commence, and that they should not disturb you during this time. If
you leave a message and someone returns your call, your staff can take a
message, and you can return the call later.
4. Lock yourself in your office and start placing the calls.
Keep a log sheet of how many calls you make per day. You can start out slow,
with maybe 10 or 25 calls a day, but I strongly urge you to set a goal of 100
calls per day. This seems to be the optimum number for success.
Working Your Way to the Decision Maker
Salespeople often get screened out by receptionists or other employees who
are a little lower on the totem pole than the company executives — the deci-
sion makers. I have a trick to work my way past these sales screeners.
When I call someone, even if they have know idea who I am, I say, in the most
authoritative voice I can muster up, like I’m some kind of rock star, “Hi! This
is Ralph Roberts!” The person I called is too embarrassed to admit that she
has no idea who I am. I keep the conversation going, and then after some
time, I say something like, “. . . Okay, you really don’t know who I am, do
you?” The person I was talking to usually admits the fact and typically puts
me through to the person in charge. 
Being Yourself
Before customers are going to buy from you, they have to buy into you, and
that you had better look, act, and sound genuine. Even though I step it up
when I’m selling and try to infuse a little more energy in the relationship than
I normally do when I’m not selling, I’m always Ralph R. Roberts. People know
what they’re getting — a somewhat, nay, overzealous madman.
333
Chapter 21: Ten Power-Selling Tactics and Techniques

Some people won’t like what you have to offer, but if you’re going to have any
staying power in sales, you’d better be real and true to yourself. Trying to act
the way you think others want you to act is only going to exhaust you.
Focusing on Ends . . . and Letting 
the Means Fall into Place
Far too many salespeople get so wrapped up in planning their success and
worrying about how they’re going to achieve it that they never take the first
step to attaining their goals. Those who ultimately succeed set their eyes on
the prize and then deal with all the details.
Remember back to when you were first learning how to ride a two-wheeler
(without the training wheels). You knew that balance was the key, but you
probably were so focused on balance that you forgot to pedal and you’d keep
falling down or teetering at best. Your dad or mom or whoever was training
you, probably held the bike and ran alongside you to give you the confidence
you needed and to keep you mind off the balancing act. Then, the person
would let go, tricking you into thinking that he still “had” you. Pedaling is the
secret to keeping your balance — you have to keep moving forward with your
eyes on the goal and not worry so much about how you’re going to get there.
Categorizing Your Customers
Being a salesperson often seems like being a migrant farm worker. You’re busy
during the planting season and when the crop is ready to harvest, and busi-
ness is dead in between. To keep this from happening, you may be tempted
to over-commit, taking on too many clients and being unable to provide them
with quality customer service.
In the best of all possible worlds, you would have a steady stream of busi-
ness, but that’s a pipe dream — it’s probably not going to happen. The next
best thing you can do is to categorize your customers:
 A customers — the most dollar-productive customers: Paying customers
receive your full attention when they demand it. These are the people
who are going to continue to drive business, leads, and opportunities in
your direction. Keep them happy.
 B customers — top prospects: These may be existing customers who
aren’t exactly in the top bracket or prospects who you strongly believe
334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

could reach that upper bracket. These are the people you want to spend
the most time nurturing.
 C customers — good prospects: These prospective customers are very
promising candidates with whom you want to spend sufficient time and
resources to nurture. 
 D customers — for “deleted”: These are existing customers or prospec-
tive customers who are going to drain you of time and resources offering
little if any return on your investment. You want to let these people go or
refer them to some other salesperson down the road.
List your top 5 customers, your top 25 customers, and your top 100 cus-
tomers and then assign them to your slots — A, B, and C. These are the cus-
tomers you want to focus on, in that order.
Asking for Referrals
When you’ve earned a customer’s satisfaction, don’t hesitate to ask the cus-
tomer to refer you to others who may need your products or services. Supply
your customer with a stack of business cards and ask him to hand them out
freely and call you if he needs more.
Better yet, ask for the names and contact information for two or three people
your customer knows who may be in need of what you’re selling. If your cus-
tomer can’t think of anyone right off the top of her head, ask whether you can
call back in a couple days. You may even offer the person some incentive to
provide you with referrals, perhaps a discount or rebate of some sort.
The best time to ask a customer for a referral is when the person thanks you
for going above and beyond the call of duty. The person says “thank you”
probably because she has no better way of showing her appreciation. Give
her that better way by asking for a referral.
Staying Put . . . Rather 
Than Job Hopping
The temptation to change jobs whenever the commissions splits are unsatis-
factory or your company seems unsupportive can be overwhelming. From
what I’ve seen in the field, however, job hopping is generally counterproduc-
tive. You waste a great deal of time and energy getting re-established.
335
Chapter 21: Ten Power-Selling Tactics and Techniques

Sometimes the grass looks greener on the other side of the valley, so you
change jobs. During the change, you happen to get back to the basics, and
you achieve success, so you tend to think that the job change is what did it.
But if you would have focused on the basics before you left rather then let-
ting your resentment fester, you could have gained success without interrupt-
ing it and probably achieved an even higher level of success.
The most important resources you have at your disposal are not the external
resources that your company offers you, but your own internal resources —
your skills and your determination to succeed. Sell more, earn more, and your
boss is likely to be very eager to negotiate better splits with you. You have to
take the first step, and it doesn’t have to be a step out the door.
I’m not saying that you should always stick with a job no matter what.
Sometimes, you have to walk, but try renegotiating with your supervisor
before making a final decision.
Just Do It!
The single one huge mistake that all mediocre or lousy salespeople make is
that they don’t follow through. They pay for books, seminars, tapes, classes,
coaching, and everything else they need to know to succeed, and then they
fail to follow through on one single thing they’ve learned. When choosing
people to coach, I try to screen out people like this, but I still meet far too
many of them.
Whenever you pick up a new tip, discover a new technique, or hear about a
great technology that can make you more productive, try it out — put the
idea into action. Even if it doesn’t work for you, you’ve made some progress.
You now know more than before you tried it. And if it works, all the better.
You now have one more tool in your sales arsenal.
I owe my success to what I like to refer to as sticktoitism, a word I made up in
place of stick-to-itiveness. Sticktoitism is a dogged determination in the face
of challenge or perceived failure. Very often, you are closest to success just
before giving up. Even if you don’t see positive results immediately, keep at it.
As long as you stick to it, you will eventually succeed.

Ten Ways to Break Your Sales
Slump . . . or Avoid It Entirely
In This Chapter
 Dodging a sales slump before it happens
 Giving yourself even more reasons to sell
 Flexing your marketing muscle
 Seeking inspiration from your mentor or partner
 Putting your family to work for you
E
ven power sellers have slow days . . . or weeks or months. The trick is 
to keep working and more importantly keep networking, marketing, and
pounding the pavement to pull yourself out of that slump. 
In this chapter, I offer ten proven methods for cranking up sales after a 
slowdown . . . or even a meltdown and a few tips for keeping that momentum
flowing.
Steering Clear of Sales Slumps
I consider a slump any time I wander off task. I find that I work better when
someone else is around — a staff person who can keep me focused. Some-
times, I leave the building and take a short walk, and then I tell myself to get
back at it.
The key factor in avoiding a slump is knowing what usually triggers it. Here
are some common triggers and other causes to look out for:
 Making the sale: When you make a sale, especially a big sale you
worked hard on, the tendency is to breathe a big sigh of relief and cele-
brate. That’s great, but don’t party too long.
 Focusing too much on the present: When you focus too much on the
present and not enough on building your future, you may lull yourself

into thinking that just because you don’t have a client or prospect to
deal with, you have nothing to do. Turn down time into productive time.
 Getting distracted: Even a minor distraction can push your wheels off
the tracks. Either ignore the distraction or deal with it and then get back
to what you were doing.
 Being able to pay your bills: If you’re highly motivated by commissions,
you may tend to ease up whenever all your bills are paid up. To keep
this from happing, work ahead. Have a goal to save up a certain amount
of money, so you’re not selling in “feast or famine mode” — working too
hard when bills stack up and not hard enough when times are good.
 Dealing with negative people: Naysayers and other people with bad
attitudes can drag you down and take the wind right out of your sails . . .
and your sales. See “Steering Clear of Negative People and Situations,”
later in this chapter. 
You may also experience slumps on a regular basis due to the nature of your
business. In real estate, for example, people buy and sell fewer homes over
the winter and more in the spring. Recognize the timing of these slumps and
plan for them. Don’t worry or fret about these slumps, because worry is a
sure way to kill future sales. Keep a confident and positive attitude.
Motivating Yourself with 
Added Incentives
Ideally, everyone should be motivated by the inner desire to compete and
win, but the world is not an ideal place, and selling may not be what you
really want to be doing right now. Or perhaps you recently achieved a goal
and no longer have anything to shoot for.
Whatever the case, you get up and go, got up and went, and now you need
something to kick you into gear. Try dangling a carrot in front of yourself.
Plan a vacation. Go car shopping. Look at new houses. Find something that
you really want to work for, and dangle that reward in front of yourself. Some-
times a little added incentive is all it takes. Eventually you find that you don’t
work for things anymore — you work for the thrill of the deal. Putting a deal
together and knowing that you ultimately helped is a real hoot and a great
motivator.
A reward doesn’t always have to be a possession. You may want to set the
goal of spending more quality time with your family, setting aside more time
to volunteer in the community, or even earning some extra money for your
338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

favorite charity. Anything that gives you a purpose to sell is fair game. I call
this moving from success to significance. Once you’ve met the needs of your-
self and your family, you can focus on more meaningful endeavors.
Steering Clear of Negative 
People and Situations
When your entire office or the entire industry is experiencing a sales slump,
all the Negative Nancy’s start crawling out of the woodwork to whine about
how bad it is, berate management, and complain. Don’t get caught up in this
downward spiral of negativity. It will suck the positive energy right out of you.
Avoid the break room, coffee room, lunch room, water cooler, and wherever
else the negative people congregate. Seek out the positive people and spend
time with them planning on how to pull yourselves and your company out of
the current slump. You may be able to turn a negative person positive, but
don’t expend too much energy on such pursuits, and never let someone drag
you in the same hole they’re in (hey, isn’t that a Dylan song?).
Its not about being surrounded by “Yes” people. It’s about balance — 
surrounding yourself with positive people who challenge you to be your 
best and who bring out the best in you.
Starting Right Now
One method to quit smoking is to pick a date on which you are going to be
smoke-free. Theoretically, this gives you a few final days to indulge yourself
prior to making an all-out commitment to stop.
What some people do, however, is set to start on Monday, indulge themselves
over the weekend, manage to make it through Monday, and then start back
on Tuesday with the goal of quitting again on Monday. It reminds me of a
restaurant I frequent that has a sign posted saying “Free Beer Tomorrow.”
Every time someone enters the place, they’re promised free beer tomorrow.
Instead of setting a date on which to begin doing something positive or stop
doing something negative, start now. Even if you take the tiniest step toward
your goal, you’re making progress. Don’t put it off until tomorrow. Tomorrow
never comes.
339
Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Break Your Sales Slump . . . or Avoid It Entirely

Don’t delay the launch! You will miss the boat. Speaking of boats, I recently read
some words of wisdom that apply to this topic at www.suddenlysenior.
com/noahsark.html.
Re-Committing Yourself to Success
A sales slump is often a sign that you’re operating off plan. You made a com-
mitment to success, carefully drew up an effective plan, worked your plan 
for a few days or weeks or months, and then became so busy that you com-
pletely forgot about your plan. You’re now back to where you started. Even
worse, you may begin to think the plan failed.
Get rid of any thoughts you may have of ditching your plan. If your plan for
success really didn’t work, tweak the plan and try again. If you simply drifted
off plan, then regroup and re-commit to getting back on plan. Refer to Chapter 3
for a brief refresher course on drawing up and implementing your plan.
A failed plan can also indicate that you’re spending too little time on real
business and too much time on monkey business. Get rid of the time wasters
and back to dollar productive activities. Stop the feel good stuff and get on to
the business of business.
Ramping Up Your Marketing Efforts
When you’re selling little or nothing, that usually means people have forgot-
ten about you. Unfortunately, far too many salespeople mistakenly think it
means that they need to sit by the phone and wait for it to ring.
People get caught up in making a living and living their lives. Don’t take this
personally, but many of your customers and people who would be your cus-
tomers if they knew about you don’t really give you much thought on a daily
basis. . . unless, of course, you give them reason to think about you.
When sales slip, you have much more time on your hands to shake the bushes
for business. Ramp up your marketing efforts by exploring a marketing
medium you haven’t yet tried. Chapter 16 is packed with ideas. Also, check
out Chapter 15 for tips on how to explore opportunities in other markets. You
could be in the sales slump because you are doing all the wrong stuff. Go
back and see what worked before, re-visit the basics, and then get creative. 
340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

After your increased marketing efforts pull you out of your current slump,
keep at it. Salespeople who ignore marketing when sales are brisk and attend
to it only when sales taper off discover that their sales slumps are deeper,
longer, and more frequent. Market in good times and bad, especially in bad
times. When you find yourself thinking, “I can’t afford to advertise,” you’re
probably at a point where you can’t afford not to advertise.
Revisiting Your Relationships
One of the best sales prospecting tools you have are the relationships you’ve
nurtured with customers, colleagues, and other people you’ve bumped into
as a part of your networking activities. When business tapers off, use the
extra time to rekindle old relationships and begin new ones.
As I explain in Chapter 14, don’t contact people only when you need them.
Make a habit of keeping in touch with your contacts and strengthening your
relationships over the course of the year. When you’re in a sales slump, con-
tacting these people for assistance or leads won’t feel as though you just call
when you need something. When you make a habit of keeping in touch with
contacts over the course of your career, you soon discover that your sales
slumps become more shallow and less frequent.
Reviewing Your Records
Sometimes, you may not be able to easily identify why you’re experiencing a
slow time. Maybe it’s the market. Perhaps it’s something you’re doing or not
doing.
Keep impeccable records and then review those records when you’ve had a
string of what appears to be bad luck or good luck. You can often spot pat-
terns in what you’re doing or not doing that correspond to the hills and val-
leys you’re experiencing. The only catch is that you need good records.
If you don’t already keep a journal, day planner, or some other log of what
you’re doing to improve sales, start today. You can’t identify what’s working
and not working unless you have clear records showing what you tried and
when.
341
Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Break Your Sales Slump . . . or Avoid It Entirely

Consulting Your Supervisor, Mentor,
Personal Partner, or Coach
When a baseball player has a batting slump, the batting coach steps up to the
plate and assists in analyzing the batter’s swing. Even though you’re a profes-
sional salesperson (and probably not an athlete), you may not have a clear,
unbiased view of your sales technique.
Consult an expert. Ask another salesperson whose opinion you respect or ask
your mentor, coach, supervisor, or personal partner for some advice. Describe
your current situation in detail, including what you were doing when sales
were good, what you were doing when the slump started, and what you’re
doing now. Ask your sales doctors for their diagnoses and treatment plans,
and then sit down and then consult with them to decide on a cure.
Outside experts may not be able to offer any real solution, but even so, they
can often make you feel less isolated and offer a compassionate ear that may
be sufficient in assisting you with working through the problem yourself.
When you’re in a rut, falling off the face of the earth is too easy. Keep in touch
with people. Call a positive friend and go out to lunch. Get jazzed up. You
know what gets you motivated, so do it.
Getting Your Friends 
and Family Involved
Your family holds a significant stake in your sales success, so get them involved
in motivating you and generating ideas. Make a contest out of it. Tell your
family that if you become the top salesperson for the month, you can all go
on some mini-vacation. Set a sales goal for the week, and when you achieve
that goal, you can all go out to dinner and a movie.
Get your family excited about your success. The more excited they become,
the more they can motivate you with their support and suggestions. Excite-
ment is contagious!
